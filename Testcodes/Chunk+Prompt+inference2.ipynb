Muscle-specific RING finger protein-1 (MuRF1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase selectively expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. This protein is upregulated during skeletal muscle atrophy and is able to control sarcomere muscle protein degradation.\n",
            "- The first muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases that were discovered to have a role in muscle loss were Atrogin-1/MAFbx and muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF1). Substrates of MuRF1 are myosin heavy chains, myosin light chains, actin, myosin binding protein C, and troponin I. It has been found that MuRF1 knockout mice are more resistant to muscle atrophy produced by different pathological conditions.\n",
            "- Substrates of MuRF1 are myosin heavy chains, myosin light chains, actin, myosin binding protein C, and troponin I. It has been found that MuRF1 knockout mice are more resistant to muscle atrophy produced by different pathological conditions. Accordingly, the MuRF1 overexpression in mice enhances ubiquitination of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, and causes neuromuscular junction instability and muscle atrophy.\n",

Accordingly, the MuRF1 overexpression in mice enhances ubiquitination of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, and causes neuromuscular junction instability and muscle atrophy. However, the absence of MuRF1 does not protect soleus muscle atrophy induced by spaceflight, showing that this model is quite different with respect to other models of atrophy.\n",
            "- Accordingly, the MuRF1 overexpression in mice enhances ubiquitination of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, and causes neuromuscular junction instability and muscle atrophy. However, the absence of MuRF1 does not protect soleus muscle atrophy induced by spaceflight, showing that this model is quite different with respect to other models of atrophy. During atrophy, other E3s are produced in smaller quantities, including Trim32, a ligase important for actin, tropomyosin, and troponins degradation.\n",
            "- For example, the inhibition of some specific muscle proteins such as MAFbx or Foxo, ATF4, Gadd45a, p21, and MEKK4 transcription factors can avoid the loss of muscle mass without leading to a hypertrophic condition. Among the different ubiquitin ligases, MuRF1 and TRAF6 have been studied for the development of muscle-specific inhibitors. However, the removal of MuRF1 or TRAF6 only partially preserves muscle atrophy during denervation in mice.\n",
            "- Among the different ubiquitin ligases, MuRF1 and TRAF6 have been studied for the development of muscle-specific inhibitors. However, the removal of MuRF1 or TRAF6 only partially preserves muscle atrophy during denervation in mice. As an example, MG132 proteasome inhibitor can prevent muscle atrophy associated with muscle disuse.\n",
            "- Therefore, the administration of protein supplements or compounds able to stimulate protein synthesis could be useful in the prevention of atrophy. For instance, ursolic acid stimulates muscle hypertrophy and reduces the expression of MuRF-1 in soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of chronic kidney disease mice. It also reduced myostatin and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) in dexamethasone-treated C2C12 cell lines.\n",

This protein is upregulated during skeletal muscle atrophy and is able to control sarcomere muscle protein degradation.\n",
