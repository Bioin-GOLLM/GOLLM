The differentiated cells had long processes, a low rate of proliferation and a high content of glial fibrillary acidic protein. When the medium was replaced with Datura stramonium agglutinin-free medium after 1 h, cell proliferation continued to be inhibited.', 'Proliferation of four human glial tumour cells was also inhibited by Datura stramonium agglutinin. Further, these differentiated human glial tumour cells had long processes and a high content of glial fibrillary acidic protein similar to differentiated C6 glioma cells. Taken together, these observations suggest that Datura stramonium agglutinin may be useful as a new therapy for treating glioma without side effects.', 'Recently, we found that DSA induced differentiation of astrocytes. Addition of DSA caused a morphological change from a polygonal shape to a stellate shape with many long processes, an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and suppression of proliferation. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether DSA can inhibit cell-specific proliferation and induce differentiation of glioma cells.', 'Increased expression of GFAP after addition of DSA', 'Immunoblotting with anti-GFAP antibody.

            "['We found that a lectin, Datura stramonium agglutinin, induced irreversible differentiation in C6 glioma cells. The differentiated cells had long processes, a low rate of proliferation and a high content of glial fibrillary acidic protein. When the medium was replaced with Datura stramonium agglutinin-free medium after 1 h, cell proliferation continued to be inhibited.', 'Proliferation of four human glial tumour cells was also inhibited by Datura stramonium agglutinin. Further, these differentiated human glial tumour cells had long processes and a high content of glial fibrillary acidic protein similar to differentiated C6 glioma cells. Taken together, these observations suggest that Datura stramonium agglutinin may be useful as a new therapy for treating glioma without side effects.', 'Recently, we found that DSA induced differentiation of astrocytes. Addition of DSA caused a morphological change from a polygonal shape to a stellate shape with many long processes, an increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and suppression of proliferation. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether DSA can inhibit cell-specific proliferation and induce differentiation of glioma cells.', 'Increased expression of GFAP after addition of DSA', 'Immunoblotting with anti-GFAP antibody. Cells cultured in media containing 10% FBS, were collected 24 h after incubation without (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9) and with DSA (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10).', 'Lanes from 1 to 8 contained 5 mug protein, and lanes 9 and 10 did 10 mug. The PVDF membrane was stained with anti-GFAP antibody. The migration positions of GFAP and molecular weight markers (kilodalton) are indicated (lane 11).', 'The PVDF membrane was stained with anti-GFAP antibody. The migration positions of GFAP and molecular weight markers (kilodalton) are indicated (lane 11).', 'The malignancy of gliomas is inversely correlated with the content of astrocyte-specific intermediate filament protein (GFAP). Furthermore, mature astrocytes are characterised by the expression of a large amount of GFAP.', 'The malignancy of gliomas is inversely correlated with the content of astrocyte-specific intermediate filament protein (GFAP). Furthermore, mature astrocytes are characterised by the expression of a large amount of GFAP. GFAP is expressed exclusively in astrocytes and the expression level increases during differentiation.', 'Furthermore, mature astrocytes are characterised by the expression of a large amount of GFAP. GFAP is expressed exclusively in astrocytes and the expression level increases during differentiation. C6 cells were found to produce only a small amount of GFAP due to their malignant properties.', 'GFAP is expressed exclusively in astrocytes and the expression level increases during differentiation. C6 cells were found to produce only a small amount of GFAP due to their malignant properties. The immunoblot in Figure 3 shows clearly that the expression of GFAP was enhanced after the addition of DSA.', 'C6 cells were found to produce only a small amount of GFAP due to their malignant properties. The immunoblot in Figure 3 shows clearly that the expression of GFAP was enhanced after the addition of DSA. A densitometric evaluation of the blot indicated that the amount of GFAP after the addition of DSA increased over hundred fold relative to the amount in the control cells.', 'The immunoblot in Figure 3 shows clearly that the expression of GFAP was enhanced after the addition of DSA. A densitometric evaluation of the blot indicated that the amount of GFAP after the addition of DSA increased over hundred fold relative to the amount in the control cells. The corresponding values of human glial tumour cell lines were more than 12.2 times.', 'The corresponding values of human glial tumour cell lines were more than 12.2 times. Differentiated astrocytes are characterised by a stellate cell morphology, increased GFAP expression, and inhibited proliferation. We conclude that C6 cells and human glial tumour-cell lines were induced to differentiate by DSA.', 'During organogenesis in the central nervous system, differentiated astrocytes are characterised by a high expression of GFAP, a change from a polygonal shape to a stellate shape, and a low rate of proliferation. In the present study, we showed that DSA-treated cells express the characteristics of differentiation, i.e., they had a high content of GFAP, long processes, and a low rate of proliferation.', 'During organogenesis in the central nervous system, differentiated astrocytes are characterised by a high expression of GFAP, a change from a polygonal shape to a stellate shape, and a low rate of proliferation.

GFAP is expressed exclusively in astrocytes, and that the amount of GFAP is closely related to the differentiation of astrocytes. In addition to being a marker of matured astrocytes, GFAP is considered to be important for the induction and maintenance of astrocyte differentiation, because introduction of GFAP to C6 cells and human astrocytoma induced morphological changes, and suppressed their proliferation and invasive potential.', 'GFAP is expressed exclusively in astrocytes, and that the amount of GFAP is closely related to the differentiation of astrocytes.

After addition of DSA to glioma cells, the cells grew at a much reduced rate, they changed from a flattened epithelioidal shape to a stellate shape having two or more long processes, so that some of the cells resembled normal fibrous astrocytes, and their content of GFAP was strikingly increased. These changes showed that DSA caused glioma cells to differentiate and thus may be useful as a new therapy for human glioma.', 'Regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in CNS development and in pathological states', 'Synthesis of glial fibrillary acidic protein in rat C6 glioma in chemically defined medium: cyclic AMP-dependent transcriptional and translational regulation', 'Transfection of human astrocytoma cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein complementary DNA: analysis of expression, proliferation, and tumorigenicity', 'Immunocytochemical study of the glial fibrillary acidic protein in human neoplasms of the central nervous system', 'Cell growth suppression of astrocytoma C6 cells by glial fibrillary acidic protein cDNA transfection']\n",
