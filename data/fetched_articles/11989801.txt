erythro-2-Phenyl-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine and its 8-aza analog were prepared 
and showed a very high inhibitory activity towards adenosine deaminase (ADA), 
with Ki 0.55 and 1.67 nM, respectively, and high affinity for A1 adenosine 
receptors, with Ki 28 and 2.8 nM, respectively. To increase affinity for A1 
receptors we introduced a substituent on the N6 position such as alkyl or 
cycloalkyl groups, which are present in effective agonists or antagonists. 
Furthermore, for some compounds, we prepared the two diastereoisomers erythro 
and threo to verify whether the binding with A1 receptors is stereoselective, as 
in ADA. Results show that some of the synthesised compounds are good inhibitors 
for ADA and good ligands for A1, and the erythro diastereoisomers are more 
active than the threo ones. The experimental evidence allows us to hypothesise 
some similarity in the three dimensional structures of the binding site of the 
two proteins, ADA and A1 adenosine receptor, in spite of lacking any homologies 
in the amino acid sequences.
