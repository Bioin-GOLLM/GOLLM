Cigarette smoke contains more than 4500 chemicals which have toxic, mutagenic 
and carcinogenic effects. Strong evidences have shown that current smokers take 
a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer than nonsmokers. However, less 
attention has been paid to the smoking induced abnormalities in the individuals 
defined as healthy smokers who are normal with spirometry, radiographic images, 
routine physical exam and categorized as healthy control group in many 
researches. Actually, 'healthy smokers' are not healthy. This narrative review 
focuses on the smoking related pathophysiologic changes mainly in the 
respiratory system of healthy smokers, including inflammation and immune 
changes, genetic alterations, structural changes and pulmonary dysfunction.
