X-chromosome inactivation has long served as an experimental model system for 
understanding the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Central to this 
phenomenon is the long, non-coding RNA Xist that is specifically expressed from 
the inactive X chromosome and spreads along the entire length of the chromosome 
in cis. Recently, two of the proteins originally identified as components of the 
nuclear scaffold/matrix (S/MAR-associated proteins) have been shown to control 
the principal features of X-chromosome inactivation; specifically, 
context-dependent competency and the chromosome-wide association of Xist RNA. 
These findings implicate the involvement of nuclear S/MAR-associated proteins in 
the organization of epigenetic machinery. Here, we describe a model for the 
functional role of S/MAR-associated proteins in the regulation of key epigenetic 
processes.
