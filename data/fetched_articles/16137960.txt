PURPOSE: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) presents in early adulthood 
with painless progressive blindness of one or both eyes. Usually there is a 
positive family history of similar disease on the maternal side. Definitive 
diagnosis can be established by finding the change in the mitochondrial gene. No 
molecular studies have been reported from India.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical, ophthalmologic and molecular studies were 
carried out in two patients from different families and available first degree 
relatives. The subjects were tested for the three common mutations seen in LHON 
by molecular techniques of polymerase chain reaction using mutation specific 
primers.
RESULTS: The mutations G3460A and G11778A in the mitochondrial genes MTND1 and 
MTND4, known to be causative for LHON, were found in one family each.
CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of LHON should be considered in familial cases and in 
young adults with optic atrophy. Confirmation of diagnosis should be sought by 
molecular gene analysis. Genetic counselling should be offered to all 'at risk' 
relatives of a patient harbouring the mutation.
