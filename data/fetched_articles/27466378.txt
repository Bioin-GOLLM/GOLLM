The diversity of microtubule functions is dependent on the status of tubulin 
C-termini. To address the physiological role of the C-terminal aromatic residue 
of α-tubulin, a tub1-Glu yeast strain expressing an α-tubulin devoid of its 
C-terminal amino acid was used to perform a genome-wide-lethality screen. The 
identified synthetic lethal genes suggested links with endocytosis and related 
processes. In the tub1-Glu strain, the routing of the v-SNARE Snc1 was strongly 
impaired, with a loss of its polarized distribution in the bud, and Abp1, an 
actin patch or endocytic marker, developed comet-tail structures. Snc1 
trafficking required dynamic microtubules but not dynein and kinesin motors. 
Interestingly, deletion of the microtubule plus-end-tracking protein Bik1 (a 
CLIP170 ortholog), which is preferentially recruited to the C-terminal residue 
of α-tubulin, similarly resulted in Snc1 trafficking defects. Finally, 
constitutively active Rho1 rescued both Bik1 localization at the microtubule 
plus-ends in tub1-Glu strain and a correct Snc1 trafficking in a Bik1-dependent 
manner. Our results provide the first evidence for a role of microtubule 
plus-ends in membrane cargo trafficking in yeast, through Rho1- and 
Bik1-dependent mechanisms, and highlight the importance of the C-terminal 
α-tubulin amino acid in this process.
