Propylamycin (4'-deoxy-4'-propylparomomycin) is a next generation aminoglycoside 
antibiotic that displays increased antibacterial potency over the parent, 
coupled with reduced susceptibility to resistance determinants and reduced 
ototoxicity in the guinea pig model. Propylamycin nevertheless is inactivated by 
APH(3')-Ia, a specific aminoglycoside phosphotransferase isozyme that acts on 
the primary hydroxy group of the ribofuranosyl moiety (at the 5''-position). To 
overcome this problem, we have prepared and studied the antibacterial and 
antiribosomal activity of various propylamycin derivatives carrying amino or 
substituted amino groups at the 5''-position in place of the vulnerable hydroxy 
group. We find that the introduction of an additional basic amino group at this 
position, while overcoming the action of the aminoglycoside 
phosphoryltransferase isozymes acting at the 5''-position as anticipated, 
results in a significant drop in selectivity for the bacterial over the 
eukaryotic ribosomes that is predictive of increased ototoxicity. In contrast, 
5''-deoxy-5''-formamidopropylamycin retains the excellent across-the-board 
levels of antibacterial activity of propylamycin itself, while circumventing the 
action of the offending aminoglycoside phosphotransferase isozymes and affording 
even greater selectivity for the bacterial over the eukaryotic ribosomes. Other 
modifications to address the susceptibility of propylamycin to the APH(3')-Ia 
isozyme including deoxygenation at the 3'-position and incorporation of a 
6',5''-bis(hydroxyethylamino) modification offer no particular advantage.
