Anticholinergic burden tools have relevant pharmacological gaps that may explain 
their limited predictive ability for clinical outcomes. The aim of this study 
was to provide a universal pharmacological-based list of drugs with their 
documented affinity for muscarinic receptors. A comprehensive literature review 
was performed to identify the anticholinergic burden tools. Drugs included in 
these instruments were searched in four pharmacological databases, and the 
investigation was supplemented with PubMed. The evidence regarding the potential 
antagonism of the five muscarinic receptors of each drug was assessed. The 
proportion of drugs included in the tools with an affinity for muscarinic 
receptors was evaluated. A universal list of drugs with anticholinergic activity 
was developed based on their documented affinity for the different subtypes of 
muscarinic receptors and their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. A total 
of 23 tools were identified, including 304 different drugs. Only 48.68%, 47.70%, 
48.03%, 43.75%, and 42.76% of the drugs had an affinity to the M1, M2, M3, M4, 
and M5 receptor, respectively, reported in any pharmacological database. The 
proportion of drugs with confirmed antagonism varied among the tools (36.8% to 
100%). A universal pharmacological-based list of 133 drugs is presented. It 
should be further validated in different clinical settings.
