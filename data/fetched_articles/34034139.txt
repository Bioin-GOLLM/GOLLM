OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to replicate a recent study that reported an association 
between the rs9470080 CC-genotype and common somatic symptoms in women, but not 
in men. Additionally, we quantified the genetic contribution to phenotypic 
variation in common somatic symptom levels.
METHODS: We used data from the Lifelines Cohort Study, including 28,299 
participants (60.0% female; 44.2% CC-genotype; mean age 42.9 (14.2) years). 
Common somatic symptoms were measured with the SCL-90 SOM subscale. To assess 
the association between the rs9470080 genotype and SCL-90 SOM scores we applied 
similar analyses as the original study, including independent t-tests, two-way 
ANOVAs and a mixed ANOVA. To estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance in 
SCL-90 SOM scores explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we used a 
genomic-relatedness-based restricted maximum-likelihood method.
RESULTS: We could not replicate the original study's findings. We found no 
association between the rs9470080 genotype and common somatic symptom levels in 
either female or male participants (F(1, 8775) = 1.07, p = 0.30 and 
F(1,13,903) = 0.01, p = 0.93, respectively). Genome-wide heritability analyses 
show that 12.1% (p = 2.1e-08) of the phenotypic variance in common somatic 
symptom levels in Lifelines can be explained by SNPs. The genetic contribution 
to common somatic symptom levels was higher in male participants 
(SNP-h2 = 20.5%; p = 9.1e-08) than in female participants (SNP-h2 = 12.0%, 
p = 2.8e-05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings of significant SNP-h2 and the sex-specific differences 
herein, does warrant further sex-stratified research of individual genetic 
variants associated with common somatic symptoms. Preferably, further research 
should be performed within the analytic framework of a genome-wide association 
study.
