The base-quenched probe method for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) relies on real-time PCR and melting-curve approaches. Here, we applied 
the most common commercial fluorophores including FAM, HEX, CY5, CY3, TET, JOE, 
Texas Red and ROX for labeling probes to detect multi-mutations simultaneously 
according to the different fluorescence channels. Accuracy of the method was 
confirmed by direct sequencing. The results demonstrated that all above dyes 
could be influenced by bases and could be applied to detect SNPs. Furthermore, 
this method was applied to detect APOM rs707921, APOM rs707922 and MCP-1 
rs1024611 simultaneously, which was demonstrated successfully.
