As organs and tissues approach their normal size during development or 
regeneration, growth slows down, and cell proliferation progressively comes to a 
halt. Among the various processes suggested to contribute to growth 
termination,1-10 mechanical feedback, perhaps via adherens junctions, has been 
suggested to play a role.11-14 However, since adherens junctions are only 
present in a narrow plane of the subapical region, other structures are likely 
needed to sense mechanical stresses along the apical-basal (A-B) axis, 
especially in a thick pseudostratified epithelium. This could be achieved by 
nuclei, which have been implicated in mechanotransduction in tissue culture.15 
In addition, mechanical constraints imposed by nuclear crowding and spatial 
confinement could affect interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM),16 which allows 
G2 nuclei to reach the apical surface, where they normally undergo mitosis.17-25 
To explore how mechanical constraints affect IKNM, we devised an 
individual-based model that treats nuclei as deformable objects constrained by 
the cell cortex and the presence of other nuclei. The model predicts changes in 
the proportion of cell-cycle phases during growth, which we validate with the 
cell-cycle phase reporter FUCCI (Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle 
Indicator).26 However, this model does not preclude indefinite growth, leading 
us to postulate that nuclei must migrate basally to access a putative basal 
signal required for S phase entry. With this refinement, our updated model 
accounts for the observed progressive slowing down of growth and explains how 
pseudostratified epithelia reach a stereotypical thickness upon completion of 
growth.
