Staphylococcal enterotoxin B is one of the most potent bacterial superantigens 
that exerts profound toxic effects upon the immune system, leading to 
stimulation of cytokine release and inflammation. It is associated with food 
poisoning, nonmenstrual toxic shock, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and nasal polyps 
in humans. Currently, there is no treatment or vaccine available. Passive 
immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies made in several different species has 
shown significant inhibition in in vitro studies and reduction in staphylococcal 
enterotoxin B-induced lethal shock in in vivo studies. This should encourage 
future endeavors to develop these antibodies as therapeutic reagents.
