Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to 
catalog the landscape of somatic mutations in tumor genomes. These mutations can 
sometimes create so-called neoantigens, which allow the immune system to detect 
and eliminate tumor cells. However, efforts that stimulate the immune system to 
eliminate tumors based on their molecular differences have had less success than 
has been hoped for, and there are conflicting reports about the role of 
neoantigens in the success of this approach. Here we review some of the 
conflicting evidence in the literature and highlight key aspects of the 
tumor-immune interface that are emerging as major determinants of whether 
mutation-derived neoantigens will contribute to an immunotherapy response. 
Accounting for these factors is expected to improve success rates of future 
immunotherapy approaches.
