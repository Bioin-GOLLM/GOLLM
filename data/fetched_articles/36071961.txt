In the latest HIV-1 global drug resistance report released by WHO, countries are 
advised to strengthen pre-treatment monitoring of drug resistance in AIDS 
patients. In this study, we established an NGS-based segmented amplification 
HIV-1 drug resistance mutation detection method. The pol region of HIV-1 was 
divided into three short fragments for NGS. The entire amplification and 
sequencing panel were more cost-effective and batched by using the barcode 
sequence corresponding to the sample. Each parameter was evaluated using samples 
with known resistance variants frequencies. The nucleotide sequence error rate, 
amino acid error rate, and noise value of the NGS-based segmented amplification 
method were both less than 1%. When the threshold was 2%, the consensus 
sequences of the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain were completely consistent with the Sanger 
sequences. This method can detect the minimum viral load of the sample at 102 
copies/ml, and the input frequency and detection frequency of HIV-1 resistance 
mutations within the range of 1%-100% had good conformity (R2 = 0.9963; 
R2 = 0.9955). This method had no non-specific amplification for Hepatitis B and 
C. Under the 2% threshold, the incidence of surveillance drug resistance 
mutations in ART-naive HIV-infected patients was 20.69%, among which NRTIs class 
resistance mutations were mainly.
