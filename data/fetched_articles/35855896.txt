mRNA is like Hermes, delivering the genetic code to cellular construction sites, 
so it has long been of interest, but only to a small group of scientists, and 
only demonstrating its remarkable efficacy in coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) vaccines allowed it to go out into the open. Therefore, now is the 
right timing to delve into the stepping stones that underpin this success and 
pay tribute to the underlying scientists. From this perspective, advances in 
mRNA engineering have proven crucial to the rapidly growing role of this 
molecule in healthcare. Development of consecutive generations of cap analogs, 
including anti-reverse cap analogs (ARCAs), has significantly boosted 
translation efficacy and maintained an enthusiasm for mRNA research. Nucleotide 
modification to protect mRNA molecules from the host's immune system, followed 
by finding appropriate purification and packaging methods, were other links in 
the chain enabling medical breakthroughs. Currently, vaccines are the central 
area of mRNA research, but it will reach far beyond COVID-19. Supplementation of 
missing or abnormal proteins is another large field of mRNA research. Ex vivo 
cell engineering and genome editing have been expanding recently. Thus, it is 
time to recognize mRNA pioneers while building upon their legacy.
