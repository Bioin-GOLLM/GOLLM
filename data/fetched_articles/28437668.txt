We conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder (GAD) to identify potential predictors of venlafaxine XR 
treatment outcome. Ninety-eight European American patients participated in a 
venlafaxine XR clinical trial for GAD, with Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) 
response/remission at 24 weeks as the primary outcome measure. All participants 
were genotyped with the Illumina PsychChip, and 266,820 common single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed. Although no SNPs reached genome-wide 
significance, 8 SNPs were marginally associated with treatment 
response/remission and HAM-A reduction at week 12 and 24 (p<0.00001). Several 
identified genes may indicate markers crossing neuropsychiatric diagnostic 
categories.
