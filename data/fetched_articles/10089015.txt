Approximately 10% of Japanese alcoholics develop their disease despite having an 
inactive form of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2), known as a genetic deterrent 
of heavy drinking due to adverse reactions after drinking. Such alcoholics are 
considered to be advantageous in genetic research because they should show 
reduced heterogeneity and possess genetic factors conferring susceptibility to 
alcohol dependence. Examination of the -1438 A/G polymorphism of the serotonin 
2A (5HT2A) receptor gene in 225 Japanese alcoholics with inactive ALDH2 revealed 
the presence of significantly more of the G allele than was found in 361 control 
subjects. The frequency of the G allele in 282 alcoholics with active ALDH2 fell 
between the G allele frequencies of controls and subjects with inactive ALDH2. 
These data suggest that although the effect is relatively small, genetic 
variability in the 5HT2A receptor is involved in the development of alcohol 
dependence.
