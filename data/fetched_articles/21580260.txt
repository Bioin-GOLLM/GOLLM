The crystal structure of the title compound, 
[U(NO(3))(2)O(2)(C(10)H(17)Cl(3)N(3)O(2)P)(2)], is composed of centrosymmetric 
[UO(2)(L)(2)(NO(3))(2)] mol-ecules {L is 
N-[bis-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)phosphor-yl]-2,2,2-trichloro-acetamide, 
C(10)H(17)Cl(3)N(3)O(2)P}. The U(VI) ion, located on an inversion center, is 
eight-coordinated with axial oxido ligands and six equatorial oxygen atoms of 
the phosphoryl and nitrate groups in a slightly distorted hexa-gonal-bipyramidal 
geometry. One of the pyrrolidine fragments in the ligand is disordered over two 
conformation (occupancy ratio 0.58:0.42). Intra-molecular N-Hâ‹¯O hydrogen bonds 
between the amine and nitrate groups are found.
