Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system 
(CNS) of autoimmune etiology that results from an imbalance between CNS-specific 
T effector cells and peripheral suppressive mechanisms mediated by regulatory 
cells (RC). In this research, we collected blood samples from 83 relapsing 
remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 45 healthy persons (HC), to assess the sizes of 
their RC populations, including CD4⁺CD25(high)Foxp3⁺ (nTregs), CD3⁺CD4⁺HLA(-)G⁺, 
CD3⁺CD8⁺CD28(-), CD3⁺CD56⁺, and CD56(bright) cells, and how RC are affected by 
disease activity (acute phase or remission) and types of treatment 
(methylprednisolone, interferon, or natalizumab). In addition, we isolated 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and cultured them with peptides 
mapping to myelin antigens, to determine RC responsiveness to autoantigens. The 
results showed decreased levels of nTregs in patients in the acute phase ± 
methylprednisolone and in remission + natalizumab, but HC levels in patients in 
remission or receiving interferon. Patients + interferon had the highest levels 
of CD3⁺CD4⁺HLA(-)G⁺ and CD3⁺CD8⁺CD28(-) RC, and patients in the acute phase + 
methylprednisolone the lowest. Patients in remission had the highest levels of 
CD3⁺CD56⁺, and patients in remission + natalizumab the highest levels of 
CD56(bright) cells. Only nTregs responded to autoantigens in culture, regardless 
of disease activity or treatment. The highest suppressive activity was exhibited 
by nTregs from patients in remission. In conclusion, in RRMS disease activity 
and type of treatment affect different RC populations. nTregs respond to myelin 
antigens, indicating that it is possible to restore immunological tolerance 
through nTreg induction.
