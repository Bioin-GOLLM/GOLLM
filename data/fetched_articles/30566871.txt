Spt6 is a histone chaperone that associates with RNA polymerase II and deposits 
nucleosomes in the wake of transcription. Although Spt6 has an essential 
function in nucleosome deposition, it is not known whether this function is 
influenced by post-translational modification. Here, we report that casein 
kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation of Spt6 is required for nucleosome occupancy at 
the 5' ends of genes to prevent aberrant antisense transcription and enforce 
transcriptional directionality. Mechanistically, we show that CKII 
phosphorylation of Spt6 promotes the interaction of Spt6 with Spn1, a binding 
partner required for chromatin reassembly and full recruitment of Spt6 to genes. 
Our study defines a function for CKII phosphorylation in transcription and 
highlights the importance of post-translational modification in histone 
chaperone function.
