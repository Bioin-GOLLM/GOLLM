with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Two Japanese siblings had lipid storage myopathy with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (HCM). They had slowly progressive muscle weakness and 
ventricular hypertrophy of the heart evidenced by electrocardiography and 
echocardiography. Their developmental milestones were normal until three years 
of age when mild weakness in the lower limbs became evident. Laboratory 
examination showed transient high creatine kinase levels (CK) and 
hyperammonemia. Histochemical investigation on the muscles revealed abnormal 
accumulation of sudanophilic lipid droplets predominantly in type 1 fibers, type 
2 A fiber atrophy and type 2 B fiber deficiency. In case 1, excessive lipid 
droplets were also observed in the biopsied cardiac muscle. Carnitine was 
decreased in the skeletal muscles and the serum. Treatment with DL-carnitine to 
both cases resulted in marked clinical improvement and decreased lipid droplets 
in the muscles.
