BACKGROUND: Male fertility is crucial for rice yield, and the improvement of 
rice yield requires hybrid production that depends on male sterile lines. 
Although recent studies have revealed several important genes in male 
reproductive development, our understanding of the mechanisms of rice pollen 
development remains unclear.
RESULTS: We identified a rice mutant oslap6 with complete male sterile phenotype 
caused by defects in pollen exine formation. By using the MutMap method, we 
found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation located in the 
second exon of OsLAP6/OsPKS1 was responsible for the mutant phenotype. 
OsLAP6/OsPKS1 is an orthologous gene of Arabidopsis PKSA/LAP6, which functions 
in sporopollenin metabolism. Several other loss-of-function mutants of 
OsLAP6/OsPKS1 generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing tool also exhibited 
the same phenotype of male sterility. Our cellular analysis suggested that 
OsLAP6/OsPKS1 might regulate pollen exine formation by affecting bacula 
elongation. Expression examination indicated that OsLAP6/OsPKS1 is specifically 
expressed in tapetum, and its product is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER). Protein sequence analysis indicated that OsLAP6/OsPKS1 is conserved in 
land plants.
CONCLUSIONS: OsLAP6/OsPKS1 is a critical molecular switch for rice male 
fertility by participating in a conserved sporopollenin precursor biosynthetic 
pathway in land plants. Manipulation of OsLAP6/OsPKS1 has potential for 
application in hybrid rice breeding.
