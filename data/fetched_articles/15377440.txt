BACKGROUND: Corneal dystrophy is a group of inherited blinding diseases of the 
cornea. This study was to identify the mutations of the keratoepithelin (KE) 
gene for proper diagnosis of corneal dystrophy.
METHODS: Three families with corneal dystrophy were analysed. Thirteen 
individuals at risk for corneal dystrophy in family A, the proband and her son 
in family B, and the proband in family C were examined after their blood samples 
were obtained. Mutation screening of human transforming growth factor 
beta-induced gene (BIGH3 gene) was performed.
RESULTS: Five individuals in family A were found by clinical evaluation to be 
affected with granular corneal dystrophy and carried the BIGH3 mutation W555R. 
However, both probands in families B and C, also diagnosed with granular corneal 
dystrophy, harboured the BIGH3 mutation R124H.
CONCLUSION: Molecular genetic analysis can improve accurate diagnosis of corneal 
dystrophy.
