Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is an adverse effect that negatively impacts 
the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies report 
that genetic variations in the genes of the pharmacogenetic pathway of the 
levodopa (L-DOPA) might be associated with LID development. The goal of the 
present study was to investigate a possible influence of functional genetic 
variants in the DRD1 (rs4532), DRD2 (rs1800497), DAT1 (rs28363170), and COMT 
(rs4680) genes with LID development. A total of 220 patients with idiopathic PD 
were enrolled. The genotyping for DRD1 (rs4532), DRD2 (rs1800497), DAT1 
(rs28363170), and COMT (rs4680) polymorphisms were performed using Restriction 
Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Univariate and multivariate analyses 
were performed to assess the association of these polymorphisms and risk factors 
with LID development. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed increased risk 
to LID development for both Levodopa Dose Equivalency (LED) (Hazard ratios 
(HR) = 1.001; 95% CI 1.00-1.01; p = 0.009) and individuals carrying the COMT L/L 
genotype (HR = 2.974; 95% CI 1.12-7.83; p = 0.010). Furthermore, when performed 
a Cox regression analysis adjusted for a total LED, we observed that the 
genotype COMT L/L had a 3.84-fold increased risk for LID development 
(HR = 3.841; 95% CI 1.29-11.37; p = 0.012). Our results suggest that before 
treating LID in PD patients, it is important to take into consideration genetic 
variant in the COMT gene, since COMT LL genotype may increase the risk for LID 
development.
