Most intracellular proteins lack hydrophobic pockets suitable for altering their 
function with drug-like small molecules. Recent studies indicate that some 
undruggable proteins can be targeted by compounds that can degrade them. For 
example, thalidomide-like drugs (IMiDs) degrade the critical multiple myeloma 
transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 by recruiting them to the cereblon E3 
ubiquitin ligase. Current loss of signal ("down") assays for identifying 
degraders often exhibit poor signal-to-noise ratios, narrow dynamic ranges, and 
false positives from compounds that nonspecifically suppress transcription or 
translation. Here, we describe a gain of signal ("up") assay for degraders. In 
arrayed chemical screens, we identified novel IMiD-like IKZF1 degraders and 
Spautin-1, which, unlike the IMiDs, degrades IKZF1 in a cereblon-independent 
manner. In a pooled CRISPR-Cas9-based screen, we found that CDK2 regulates the 
abundance of the ASCL1 oncogenic transcription factor. This methodology should 
facilitate the identification of drugs that directly or indirectly degrade 
undruggable proteins.
