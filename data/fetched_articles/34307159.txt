Obesity, an established risk factor for endometrial cancer (EC), is also 
associated to increased risks of intraoperative and postoperative complications. 
A reliable tool to identify patients at low risk for lymph node (LN) metastasis 
may allow minimizing the surgical staging and omit lymphadenectomy in obese 
patients. To identify molecular biomarkers that could predict LN involvement in 
obese patients with EC we performed gene expression analysis in 549 EC patients 
using publicly available transcriptomic datasets. Patients were filtrated 
according to cancer subtype, weight (>30 kg/m2) and LN status. While in the LN+ 
group, NEB, ANK1, AMIGO2, LZTS1, FKBP5, CHGA, USP32P1, CLIC6, CEMIP, HMCN1 and 
TNFRSF10C genes were highly expressed; in the LN- group CXCL14, FCN1, EPHX3, 
DDX11L2, TMEM254, RNF207, LTK, RPL36A, HGAL, B4GALNT4, KLRG1 genes were 
up-regulated. As a second step, we investigated these genes in our patient 
cohort of 35 patients (15 LN+ and 20 LN-) and found the same correlation with 
the in-silico analysis. In addition, immunohistochemical expression was 
confirmed in the tumor tissue. Altogether, our findings propose a novel panel of 
genes able to predict LN involvement in obese patients with endometrial cancer.
