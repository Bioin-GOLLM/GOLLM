Natural killer (NK) cells maintain immune homeostasis by detecting and 
eliminating damaged cells. Simultaneous activating and inhibitory input are 
integrated by NK cells, with the net signal prompting cytotoxicity and cytokine 
production, or inhibition. Chief among the inhibitory ligands for NK cells are 
'self' human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, which are sensed by killer 
immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). Through a process called 'education', the 
functional capabilities of each NK cell are counterbalanced by their sensitivity 
for inhibition by co-inherited 'self' HLA. HLA and their ligands, the killer 
immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), are encoded by polymorphic, polygenic gene 
loci that segregate independently, therefore, NK education and function differ 
even between related individuals. In this review, we describe how variation in 
NK education, reactivity and sensitivity for inhibition impacts reproductive 
success, infection, cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
