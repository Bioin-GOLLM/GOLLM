BACKGROUND: Malaria continues to be endemic in the coast and Amazon regions of 
Ecuador. Clarifying current Plasmodium falciparum resistance in the country will 
support malaria elimination efforts. In this study, Ecuadorian P. falciparum 
parasites were analysed to determine their drug resistance genotypes and 
phenotypes.
METHODS: Molecular analyses were performed to search for mutations in known 
resistance markers (Pfcrt, Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pfmdr1, k13). Pfmdr1 copy number was 
determined by qPCR. PFMDR1 transporter activity was characterized in live 
parasites using live cell imaging in combination with the Fluo-4 transport 
assay. Chloroquine, quinine, lumefantrine, mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin, and 
artemether sensitivities were measured by in vitro assays.
RESULTS: The majority of samples from this study presented the CVMNT genotype 
for Pfcrt (72-26), NEDF SDFD mutations in Pfmdr1 and wild type genotypes for 
Pfdhfr, Pfdhps and k13. The Ecuadorian P. falciparum strain ESM-2013 showed in 
vitro resistance to chloroquine, but sensitivity to quinine, lumefantrine, 
mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin and artemether. In addition, transport of the 
fluorochrome Fluo-4 from the cytosol into the digestive vacuole (DV) of the 
ESM-2013 strain was minimally detected in the DV. All analysed samples revealed 
one copy of Pfmdr1.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that Ecuadorian parasites presented the 
genotype and phenotype for chloroquine resistance and were found to be sensitive 
to SP, artemether-lumefantrine, quinine, mefloquine, and dihydroartemisinin. The 
results suggest that the current malaria treatment employed in the country 
remains effective. This study clarifies the status of anti-malarial resistance 
in Ecuador and informs the P. falciparum elimination campaigns in the country.
