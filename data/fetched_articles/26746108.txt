Bisphenol A is used in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Previous studies 
show that in utero BPA exposure inhibits germ cell nest breakdown in the F1 
generation of mice, but its effects on germ cell nest breakdown and on the ovary 
in the F2-F3 generations were unknown. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that BPA 
has transgenerational effects on the ovary. Mice were exposed to BPA in utero 
(BPA 0.5, 20, or 50μg/kg/day), and ovaries were collected at postnatal days 
(PND) 4 and 21 from the F1-F3 generations and subjected to histological 
evaluation and gene expression analyses. In utero BPA exposure did not have 
transgenerational effects on germ cell nest breakdown and gene expression on PND 
4, but it caused transgenerational changes in expression in multiple genes on 
PND 21. Collectively, these data indicate that in utero BPA exposure has some 
transgenerational effects in mice.
