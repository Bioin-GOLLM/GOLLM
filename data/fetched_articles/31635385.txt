Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs) are caused by variants in genes that 
regulate innate immunity. The current diagnostic performance of targeted 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) for AIDs is low. We assessed whether 
pre-analytic advice from expert clinicians could help improve NGS performance 
from our 4 years of experience with the sequencing of a panel of 55 AIDs genes. 
The study included all patients who underwent routine NGS testing between 
September 2014 and January 2019 at the laboratory of autoinflammatory diseases 
(Montpellier, France). Before March 2018, all medical requests for testing were 
accepted. After this time, we required validation by a reference center before 
NGS: the positive advice could be obtained after a face-to-face consultation 
with the patient or presentation of the patient's case at a multidisciplinary 
staff meeting. Targeted NGS resulted in an overall 7% genetic confirmation, 
which is consistent with recent reports. The diagnostic performance before and 
after implementation of the new pre-requisite increased from 6% to 10% (p = 
0.021). Our study demonstrated, for the first time, the beneficial effect of a 
two-step strategy (clinical expert advice, then genetic testing) for AIDs 
diagnosis and stressed the possible usefulness of the strategy in anticipation 
of the development of pan-genomic analyses in routine settings.
