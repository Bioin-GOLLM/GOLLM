Temporal behavior is an essential aspect of all biological systems. Time series 
have been previously represented as networks. Such representations must address 
two fundamental problems on how to: (1) Create appropriate networks to reflect 
the characteristics of biological time series. (2) Detect characteristic dynamic 
patterns or events as network temporal communities. General community detection 
methods use metrics comparing the connectivity within a community to random 
models, or are based on the betweenness centrality of edges or nodes. However, 
such methods were not designed for network representations of time series. We 
introduce a visibility-graph-based method to build networks from time series and 
detect temporal communities within these networks. To characterize unevenly 
sampled time series (typical of biological experiments), and simultaneously 
capture events associated to peaks and troughs, we introduce the Weighted 
Dual-Perspective Visibility Graph (WDPVG). To detect temporal communities in 
individual signals, we first find the shortest path of the network between start 
and end nodes, identifying high intensity nodes as the main stem of our 
community detection algorithm that act as hubs for each community. Then, we 
aggregate nodes outside the shortest path to the closest nodes found on the main 
stem based on the closest path length, thereby assigning every node to a 
temporal community based on proximity to the stem nodes/hubs. We demonstrate the 
validity and effectiveness of our method through simulation and biological 
applications.
