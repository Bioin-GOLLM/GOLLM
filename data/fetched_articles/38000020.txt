Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aggressive soft 
tissue sarcomas with limited treatment options, and new effective therapeutic 
strategies are desperately needed. We observe antiproliferative potency of 
genetic depletion of PTPN11 or pharmacological inhibition using the SHP2 
inhibitor (SHP2i) TNO155. Our studies into the signaling response to SHP2i 
reveal that resistance to TNO155 is partially mediated by reduced RB function, 
and we therefore test the addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) to enhance RB 
activity and improve TNO155 efficacy. In combination, TNO155 attenuates the 
adaptive response to CDK4/6i, potentiates its antiproliferative effects, and 
converges on enhancement of RB activity, with greater suppression of cell cycle 
and inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins, leading to deeper and more durable 
antitumor activity in in vitro and in vivo patient-derived models of MPNST, 
relative to either single agent. Overall, our study provides timely evidence to 
support the clinical advancement of this combination strategy in patients with 
MPNST and other tumors driven by loss of NF1.
