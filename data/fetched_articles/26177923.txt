Grainyhead-like genes are part of a highly conserved gene family that play a 
number of roles in ectoderm development and maintenance in mammals. Here we 
identify a novel allele of Grhl2, cleft-face 3 (clft3), in a mouse line 
recovered from an ENU mutagenesis screen for organogenesis defects. Homozygous 
clft3 mutants have a number of phenotypes in common with other alleles of Grhl2. 
We note a significant effect of genetic background on the clft3 phenotype. One 
of these is a reduction in size of the telencephalon where we find abnormal 
patterns of neural progenitor mitosis and apoptosis in mutant brains. 
Interestingly, Grhl2 is not expressed in the developing forebrain, suggesting 
this is a survival factor for neural progenitors exerting a paracrine effect on 
the neural tissue from the overlying ectoderm where Grhl2 is highly expressed.
