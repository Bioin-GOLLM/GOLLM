PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to address the temporal sequencing of 
involvement of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's 
disease and reconcile apparently conflicting neuropathologic and biomarker data.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although neuropathologic studies show that limbic system tau 
disease occurs ubiquitously in middle-aged individuals before the appearance of 
amyloid plaques, biomarker studies in living individuals suggest that Aβ disease 
is the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease and precedes cerebrospinal fluid 
tau changes. Evidence from neuropathologic, biomarker, genetic and 
cellular/mouse studies shows that tau accumulation in limbic regions occurs 
slowly with age and does not induce widespread neurodegeneration, but that Aβ 
interacts with tau in some way to accelerate neurofibrillary disease and induce 
neurodegeneration.
SUMMARY: Aβ aggregation is the key initial trigger of Alzheimer's disease 
pathologic changes and interacts with tau to exacerbate age-related tauopathy 
and induce neurodegeneration.
