BACKGROUND: Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is characterized by compression of the 
left renal vein (LRV) between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. 
While rare, NCS was reported to be accompanied by double inferior vena cava 
(IVC). We herein report a case of Noonan syndrome (NS) with double IVC who 
presented with macrohematuria and proteinuria.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 23-year-old man, who had been diagnosed 
with NS due to RIT1 mutation, after showing foamy macrohematuria 3 weeks 
previously. A physical examination revealed low-set ears and a webbed neck. A 
urinalysis showed hematuria and proteinuria, and urinary sediments showed more 
than 100 isomorphic red blood cells per high-power field. His proteinuria and 
albuminuria concentrations were 7.1 and 4.5 g/g⋅Cr, respectively. 
Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed double IVC 
and narrowing of the LRV after interflow of the left IVC. The aortomesenteric 
angle on a sagittal reconstruction of the CT image was 14.7°. Cystoscopy 
revealed a flow of macrohematuria from the left ureteral opening. On Doppler 
ultrasonography, there was scant evidence to raise the suspicion of the 
nutcracker phenomenon. Since severe albuminuria continued, a left kidney biopsy 
was performed. Light microscopy showed red blood cells in Bowman's space and the 
tubular lumen. Electron microscopy revealed disruption of the glomerular 
basement membrane (GBM). Vulnerability of the GBM was suspected and a genetic 
analysis revealed a heterozygous mutation at c.4793 T > G (p.L1598R) in the 
COL4A3 gene. Screening for coagulation disorders revealed the factor VIII and 
von Willebrand factor (vWF) values were low, at 47.6 and 23%, respectively. A 
multimer analysis of vWF showed a normal multimer pattern and he was diagnosed 
with von Willebrand disease type 1. As the bleeding tendency was mild, 
replacement of factor VIII was not performed. His macrohematuria and proteinuria 
improved gradually without treatment, and his urinalysis results have been 
normal for more than 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The present case showed macrohematuria and proteinuria due to NCS 
in NS with double IVC and von Willebrand disease type 1. The macrohematuria and 
proteinuria originated from glomerular hemorrhage because of vulnerability of 
the GBM due to COL4A3 mutation.
