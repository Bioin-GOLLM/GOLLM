TEM-28 (pI 6.1), expressed by an Escherichia coli clinical isolate, is a novel 
beta-lactamase which hydrolyzed ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and aztreonam with 
rates of 25, 1.1, and 5.6, respectively, relative to that for benzylpenicillin 
(100). The nucleotide sequence of blaTEM-28 differed from that of blaTEM-1 by 
two base changes, resulting in amino acid substitutions of Arg-164 to His and 
Glu-240 to Lys.
