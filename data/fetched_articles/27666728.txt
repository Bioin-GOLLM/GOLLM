BACKGROUND: The conditional Cre/lox system has recently emerged as a valuable 
tool for studies on both embryonic and adult Zebrafish. Temporal control and 
site-specific recombination are achieved by using the ligand-inducible CreERT2 
and administration of the drug tamoxifen (TAM) or its active metabolite, 
4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT).
RESULTS: Here we report the generation of a transgenic Zebrafish line, which 
expresses an mCherry-tagged variant of CreERT2 under the control of the myelin 
basic protein a (mbpa) promoter. Our analysis shows that larval and adult 
expression of the transgene recapitulates the endogenous mbpa expression pattern 
in oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, combination with a Cre-dependent EGFP reporter 
results in EGFP-expressing oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord, brain, and optic 
nerve in TAM- or 4-OHT-treated larvae and 4-month-old fish, but not in untreated 
controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The transgenic Zebrafish line Tg(mbpa:mCherry-T2A-CreERT2 ) elicits 
CreERT2 expression specifically in myelinating glia cells. Cre-inducible 
targeted recombination of genes in oligodendrocytes will be useful to elucidate 
cellular and molecular mechanisms of myelination in vivo during development 
(myelination) and regeneration (remyelination) after injury to the central 
nervous system (CNS). It will also allow targeted expression and overexpression 
of genes of interest (transgenes) in oligodendrocytes at defined developmental 
and adult stages. Developmental Dynamics 246:41-49, 2017. © 2016 Wiley
