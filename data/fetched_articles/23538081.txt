Tai Chi and Qigong are traditional Chinese exercises that are widely practiced 
for their health benefits and as martial arts. Evidence suggests that these 
practices may be effective at treating a range of physical health conditions, 
and at improving health-related quality of life. There is growing interest in 
the use of Tai Chi and Qigong to treat mental disorders, because they are 
noninvasive, exercise-based therapies, and because patients with mental 
disorders frequently use complementary and alternative medicine. Evidence is 
promising that these treatments may be effective in reducing depressive 
symptoms, stress, anxiety, and mood disturbances.
