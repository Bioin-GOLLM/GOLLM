Since its discovery in the early 1990's, cortactin has emerged as a key 
signaling protein in many cellular processes, including cell adhesion, 
migration, endocytosis, and tumor invasion. While the list of cellular functions 
influenced by cortactin grows, the ability of cortactin to interact with and 
alter the cortical actin network is central to its role in regulating these 
processes. Recently, several advances have been made in our understanding of the 
interaction between actin and cortactin, providing insight into how these two 
proteins work together to provide a framework for normal and altered cellular 
function. This review examines how regulation of cortactin through 
post-translational modifications and interactions with multiple binding partners 
elicits changes in cortical actin cytoskeletal organization, impacting the 
regulation and formation of actin-rich motility structures.
