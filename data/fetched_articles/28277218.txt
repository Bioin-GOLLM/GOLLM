Several new highly pathogenic (HP) H5 avian influenza virus (AIV) have been 
detected in poultry farms from south-western France since November 2015, among 
which an HP H5N1. The zoonotic potential and origin of these AIVs immediately 
became matters of concern. One virus of each subtype H5N1 (150169a), H5N2 
(150233) and H5N9 (150236) was characterised. All proved highly pathogenic for 
poultry as demonstrated molecularly by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site 
in their HA protein - with a sequence (HQRRKR/GLF) previously unknown among 
avian H5 HPAI viruses - or experimentally by the in vivo demonstration of an 
intravenous pathogenicity index of 2.9 for the H5N1 HP isolate. Phylogenetic 
analyses based on the full genomes obtained by NGS confirmed that the eight 
viral segments of the three isolates were all part of avian Eurasian 
phylogenetic lineage but differed from the Gs/Gd/1/96-like lineage. The study of 
the genetic characteristics at specific amino acid positions relevant for 
modulating the adaptation to and the virulence for mammals showed that 
presently, these viruses possess most molecular features characteristic of AIV 
and lack some major characteristics required for efficient respiratory 
transmission to or between humans. The three isolates are therefore predicted to 
have no significant pandemic potential.
