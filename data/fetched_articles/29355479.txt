Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most common sensory deficit in the 
elderly. The disease has a multifactorial etiology with both environmental and 
genetic factors involved being largely unknown. SLC7A8/SLC3A2 heterodimer is a 
neutral amino acid exchanger. Here, we demonstrated that SLC7A8 is expressed in 
the mouse inner ear and that its ablation resulted in ARHL, due to the damage of 
different cochlear structures. These findings make SLC7A8 transporter a strong 
candidate for ARHL in humans. Thus, a screening of a cohort of ARHL patients and 
controls was carried out revealing several variants in SLC7A8, whose role was 
further investigated by in vitro functional studies. Significant decreases in 
SLC7A8 transport activity was detected for patient's variants (p.Val302Ile, 
p.Arg418His, p.Thr402Met and p.Val460Glu) further supporting a causative role 
for SLC7A8 in ARHL. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that a relevant 
proportion of ARHL cases could be explained by SLC7A8 mutations.
