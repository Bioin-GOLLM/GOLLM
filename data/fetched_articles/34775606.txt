The immune system plays fundamental roles in the mammary gland, shaping 
developmental processes and controlling inflammation during infection and 
cancer.Here, we reveal unanticipated heterogeneity in the myeloid cell 
compartment duringdevelopment of virgin, pregnant, lactating and involuting 
mouse mammary glands,and in milk. We investigate the functional consequences of 
individual and compoundchemokine receptor deficiency on cell recruitment. 
Diverse myeloid cell recruitmentwas also shown in models of sterile inflammation 
and bacterial infection.Strikingly, we have shown that inflammation and 
infection can alter the abundanceof terminal end buds, a key developmental 
structure, within the pubertal mammarygland. This previously unknown effect of 
inflammatory burden during puberty couldhave important implications for 
understanding pubertal development.
