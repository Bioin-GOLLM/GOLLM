There is currently no report that has documented hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
in a case of Cowden syndrome. Here, we present the first reported case of HCC in 
a 60-year-old female patient with Cowden syndrome. We diagnosed the patient 
using a pathognomonic criterion of the International Cowden Consortium 
Operational Diagnostic Criteria and performed genetic analysis. Enhanced 
computed tomography demonstrated a hypervascular tumor in segment VII of the 
liver. The patient was diagnosed with Cowden syndrome because her mucocutaneous 
lesions met the pathognomonic criterion. Mutational analysis confirmed a 
heterozygous germ line TGT→TAT transition at nucleotide 407 in exon 5 of the 
phosphatase and tensin homolog detected on the chromosome 10 (PTEN) gene. Needle 
biopsy showed a poorly differentiated HCC. We also diagnosed non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) from hepatic histological findings of Mallory's bodies 
and ballooning cells. PTEN-deficient mice reportedly develop HCC through NASH. 
This is the first reported case of Cowden syndrome complicated with HCC possibly 
originating from NASH.
