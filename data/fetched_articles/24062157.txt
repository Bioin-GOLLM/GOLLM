Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSB) cause bacteria to augment expression of DNA 
repair and various stress response proteins. A puzzling exception educes the 
anticodon nuclease (ACNase) RloC, which resembles the DSB responder Rad50 and 
the antiviral, translation-disabling ACNase PrrC. While PrrC's ACNase is 
regulated by a DNA restriction-modification (R-M) protein and a phage anti-DNA 
restriction peptide, RloC has an internal ACNase switch comprising a putative 
DSB sensor and coupled ATPase. Further exploration of RloC's controls revealed, 
first, that its ACNase is stabilized by the activating DNA and hydrolysed 
nucleotide. Second, DSB inducers activated RloC's ACNase in heterologous 
contexts as well as in a natural host, even when R-M deficient. Third, the 
DSB-induced activation of the indigenous RloC led to partial and temporary 
disruption of tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln). Lastly, accumulation of CRISPR-derived 
RNA that occurred in parallel raises the possibility that the adaptive immunity 
and RloC provide the genotoxicated host with complementary protection from 
impending infections.
