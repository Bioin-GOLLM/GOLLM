BACKGROUND: Carfilzomib, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor approved for the 
treatment of relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM) has been associated with 
Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA). Several pathogenetic mechanisms of 
carfilzomib-induced TMA have been proposed; however, recently, there has been a 
shift of focus on the potential contribution of complement dysregulation. Our 
aim was to explore whether patients with carfilzomib-induced TMA harbor germline 
variants of complement-related genes, which have been characterized as risk 
factors for TMA.
METHODS: We retrospectively recruited consecutive MM patients with 
carfilzomib-induced TMA and compared them to MM patients who received â‰¥4 cycles 
of carfilzomib and did not develop signs/symptoms of TMA, in a 1:2 ratio. 
Genomic DNA from peripheral blood was analyzed using next generation sequencing 
(NGS) with a complement-related gene panel; ADAMTS13 activity and soluble C5b-9 
were measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: Complement-related variants were more common in patients with 
carfilzomib-induced TMA compared to non-TMA controls, regardless of patient and 
treatment characteristics; ADAMTS13 activity and C5b-9 were compatible with the 
phenotype of complement-related TMA.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the previous findings that implicated 
complement-related genes in the pathogenesis of carfilzomib-induced TMA. Most 
importantly, by incorporating a control group of non-TMA MM patients treated 
with carfilzomib-based regimens and functional complement assays, we enhanced 
the credibility of our findings.
