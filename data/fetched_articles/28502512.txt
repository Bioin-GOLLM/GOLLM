BACKGROUND: Reduced triglyceride clearance due to impaired lipoprotein 
lipase-mediated lipolysis contributes to severe hypertriglyceridemia in 
lipodystrophy. Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and 4 (ANGPTL4) impair 
clearance of triglycerides by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase. Whether circulating 
ANGPTL3/4 levels are altered in lipodystrophy and the effects of leptin 
replacement on these ANGPTLs are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To examine if ANGPTL3/4 levels are elevated in patients with 
generalized lipodystrophy and assess the effects of leptin replacement on these 
ANGPTLs.
METHODS: Preleptin treatment plasma levels of ANGPTLs in patients with 
generalized lipodystrophy (n = 22) were compared with healthy controls (n = 39) 
using a post hoc case-control study design. In a prospective open-label study, 
we studied the effects of metreleptin therapy (16-32 weeks) on plasma ANGPTL3/4 
in patients with generalized lipodystrophy.
RESULTS: Plasma ANGPTL3 (geometric mean [95% confidence interval]; 223 [182-275] 
vs 174 ng/mL [160-189], P = .02) but not ANGPTL4 levels (55 [37-81] vs 44 ng/mL 
[37-52], P = .26) were higher in patients with lipodystrophy compared with 
healthy controls. There was a significant decrease in total cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels following metreleptin 
therapy. After metreleptin, ANGPTL3 concentrations decreased significantly (223 
[182-275] vs 175 ng/mL [144-214], P = .01) with no change in ANGPTL4 (55 [37-81] 
vs 48 ng/mL [32-73], P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that elevated plasma levels of ANGPTL3 in 
leptin-deficient states is attenuated with leptin therapy.
