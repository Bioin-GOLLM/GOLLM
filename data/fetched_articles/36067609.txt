AIMS: Meningioma metastasis is a rare event, observed primarily in World Health 
Organization (WHO) grade 3 tumors, although it has also been reported in WHO 
grade 1 meningiomas. This study aims at clarifying whether the metastasis of a 
WHO grade 1 meningioma was associated with genetic abnormalities commonly found 
in cases that are more aggressive.
METHODS: Using next generation sequencing of a panel of 174 genes, we analyzed 
the genetic alterations of a WHO grade 1 skull-base meningioma and its paired 
lung metastases detected 22 years after craniotomy.
RESULTS: Similar to the primary tumor, lung metastases did not show mitoses or 
histological signs of malignancy. Consistent with their origin from intracranial 
tumor, they harbored the same genetic alterations as this one. These consisted 
of the pathogenic mutation p. E17K of AKT1 and variants of unknown significance 
in NOTCH1 (p. P2133T), SERPINB8 (p. H359Y) and SMARCA4 (p. P277S).
CONCLUSIONS: The E17K AKT1 mutation is frequently found in skull base 
meningiomas and without prognostic significance. Our findings suggest that 
metastasis of grade 1 meningiomas is independent of genetic alterations (CDKN2A 
homozygous deletion, pTERT mutation, or 1p, 9p, 14q and 18q loss of 
heterozygosity) commonly found in more aggressive tumors.
