Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use is ubiquitous because they are 
widely prescribed for a number of disorders in addition to depression. 
Depression increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Hence, treating 
depression with SSRIs could reduce CHD risk. However, the effects of long term 
antidepressant treatment on CHD risk, as well as other aspects of health, remain 
poorly understood. Thus, we undertook an investigation of multisystem effects of 
SSRI treatment with a physiologically relevant dose in middle-aged adult female 
cynomolgus monkeys, a primate species shown to be a useful model of both 
depression and coronary and carotid artery atherosclerosis. Sertraline had no 
effect on depressive behavior, reduced anxious behavior, increased affiliation, 
reduced aggression, changed serotonin neurotransmission and volumes of neural 
areas critical to mood disorders, and exacerbated coronary and carotid 
atherosclerosis. These data suggest that a conservative approach to prescribing 
SSRIs for cardiovascular or other disorders for long periods may be warranted, 
and that further study is critical given the widespread use of these 
medications.
