BACKGROUND: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) has been associated with impaired 
maternal-fetal communication. Protease-activated-receptor 1 (PAR1) is critical 
for trophoblast invasion and establishment unrelated to its role in vascular 
biology.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze whether polymorphisms of PAR1 [-1426C/T], [-506I/D], 
and/or IVS[-14A/T] are associated with unexplained RPL.
PATIENTS/METHODS: A case-control pilot study conducted in 39 healthy women with 
history of unexplained RPL and 98 women with a full-term, uncomplicated 
deliveries and no history of RPL.
RESULTS: Women with RPL were significantly more likely to be heterozygous for 
[-1426C/T] (12.8% versus 3.2%; p=0.049); the heterozygous state for IVS[-14A/T] 
was also more common (15.4% versus 4.4%; p=0.064). There was no difference 
between groups for [-506I/D] genotypes. The functional consequence for 
[-1426C/T] and IVS[-14A/T] polymorphisms is underscored by the markedly low PAR1 
mRNA levels in those women. Bioinformatics indicate generation of a new 
consensus motif for repressor Kruppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) in [-1426T]. 
Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis confirmed a physical 
association between KLF3 protein and the hPar1 DNA obtained from women with the 
[-1426C/T] polymorphism.
CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the significantly low PAR1 levels impact 
placenta establishment and consequently pregnancy outcome, thereby profiling a 
novel risk factor for unexplained RPL.
