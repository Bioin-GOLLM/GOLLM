Lutein (β,ε-carotene-3,3'-diol), a xanthophyll carotenoid, is found in high 
concentrations in the macula of the human retina. It has been recognized to 
exert potential effectiveness in antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. 
However, whether and how its modifications on varying types of plasmalemmal 
ionic currents occur in electrically excitable cells remain incompletely 
answered. The current hypothesis is that lutein produces any direct adjustments 
on ionic currents (e.g., hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih [or 
funny current, If]). In the present study, GH3-cell exposure to lutein resulted 
in a time-, state- and concentration-dependent reduction in Ih amplitude with an 
IC50 value of 4.1 μM. There was a hyperpolarizing shift along the voltage axis 
in the steady-state activation curve of Ih in the presence of this compound, 
despite being void of changes in the gating charge of the curve. Under continued 
exposure to lutein (3 μM), further addition of oxaliplatin (10 μM) or ivabradine 
(3 μM) could be effective at either reversing or further decreasing 
lutein-induced suppression of hyperpolarization-evoked Ih, respectively. The 
voltage-dependent anti-clockwise hysteresis of Ih responding to long-lasting 
inverted isosceles-triangular ramp concentration-dependently became diminished 
by adding this compound. However, the addition of 10 μM lutein caused a mild but 
significant suppression in the amplitude of erg-mediated or A-type K+ currents. 
Under current-clamp potential recordings, the sag potential evoked by 
long-lasting hyperpolarizing current stimulus was reduced under cell exposure to 
lutein. Altogether, findings from the current observations enabled us to reflect 
that during cell exposure to lutein used at pharmacologically achievable 
concentrations, lutein-perturbed inhibition of Ih would be an ionic mechanism 
underlying its changes in membrane excitability.
