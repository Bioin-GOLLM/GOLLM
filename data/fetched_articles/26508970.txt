OBJECTIVE: We tested for association of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 
Val(158)-Met (rs4680) polymorphism with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) using family-based test in Korean trios.
METHODS: A total of 181 subjects with ADHD along with both of their biological 
parents were recruited from University Hospitals in Korea. We performed a 
transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) on 181 trios.
RESULTS: In the TDT, we found the over-transmission of the Val allele in 
children with ADHD (Ï‡(2)=4.21, p=0.040).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the COMT Val158-Met polymorphism is 
associated with ADHD among the Korean population. However, this study must be 
replicated in larger populations.
