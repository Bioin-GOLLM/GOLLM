We have used misfolded prion protein (PrP*) as a model to investigate how 
mammalian cells recognize and degrade misfolded GPI-anchored proteins. While 
most misfolded membrane proteins are degraded by proteasomes, misfolded 
GPI-anchored proteins are primarily degraded in lysosomes. Quantitative flow 
cytometry analysis showed that at least 85% of PrP* molecules transiently access 
the plasma membrane en route to lysosomes. Unexpectedly, time-resolved 
quantitative proteomics revealed a remarkably invariant PrP* interactome during 
its trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to lysosomes. Hence, PrP* 
arrives at the plasma membrane in complex with ER-derived chaperones and cargo 
receptors. These interaction partners were critical for rapid endocytosis 
because a GPI-anchored protein induced to misfold at the cell surface was not 
recognized effectively for degradation. Thus, resident ER factors have post-ER 
itineraries that not only shield misfolded GPI-anchored proteins during their 
trafficking, but also provide a quality control cue at the cell surface for 
endocytic routing to lysosomes.
