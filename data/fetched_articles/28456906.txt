PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epigenomics has emerged as a key player in our rapidly 
evolving understanding of osteoarthritis. Historical studies implicated 
epigenetic alterations, particularly DNA methylation, in OA pathogenesis; 
however, recent technological advances have resulted in numerous epigenome-wide 
studies examining in detail epigenetic modifications in OA. The purpose of this 
article is to introduce basic concepts in epigenetics and their recent 
applications to the study of osteoarthritis development and progression.
RECENT FINDINGS: Epigenetics describes three major phenomena: DNA modification 
via methylation, histone sidechain modifications, and short noncoding RNA 
sequences which work in concert to regulate gene transcription in a heritable 
fashion. Cartilage has been the most widely studied tissue in OA, and 
differential methylation of genes involved in inflammation, cell cycle, TGFÎ², 
and HOX genes have been confirmed several times. Bone studies suggest similar 
findings, and the intriguing possibility of epigenetic changes in subchondral 
bone during many OA processes. Multiple studies have demonstrated the 
involvement of certain noncoding RNAs, particularly miR-140, in OA development 
via modulation of key catabolic factors. Although much work has been done, much 
is still unknown. Future epigenomic studies will no doubt continue to widen our 
understanding of extraarticular tissues and OA pathogenesis, and studies in 
animal models may offer glimpses into epigenome alterations in the earliest 
stages of OA.
