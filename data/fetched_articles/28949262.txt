OBJECTIVES: Neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are at 
greater risk of permanent hearing loss compared to infants in well mother and 
baby units. Several factors have been associated with this increased prevalence 
of hearing loss, including congenital infections (e.g. cytomegalovirus or 
syphilis), ototoxic drugs (such as aminoglycoside or glycopeptide antibiotics), 
low birth weight, hypoxia and length of stay. The aetiology of this increased 
prevalence of hearing loss remains poorly understood.
DESIGN: Here we review current practice and discuss the feasibility of designing 
improved ototoxicity screening and monitoring protocols to better identify 
acquired, drug-induced hearing loss in NICU neonates.
STUDY SAMPLE: A review of published literature.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that current audiological screening or monitoring 
protocols for neonates are not designed to adequately detect early onset of 
ototoxicity. This paper offers a detailed review of evidence-based research, and 
offers recommendations for developing and implementing an ototoxicity monitoring 
protocol for young infants, before and after discharge from the hospital.
