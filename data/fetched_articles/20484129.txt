OBJECTIVE: Because diabetes is the most frequent factor responsible for 
microvascular and macrovascular disease, we investigated angiogenin serum levels 
within the diabetic patient group.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated 49 patients who met the criteria to 
be in the diabetic group. Forty nondiabetic patients were included in the 
control group. We set A1C <7% as well-controlled diabetes. Serum angiogenin 
level was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.
RESULTS: Serum angiogenin levels of poorly controlled patients with type 2 
diabetes were significantly lower than those of group with well-controlled 
diabetes (361.23 +/- 126.03 ng/ml vs. 446.37 +/- 134.10 ng/ml; P = 0.001). 
Moreover, they were characterized by a significantly longer duration of the 
disease (P = 0.006), higher BMI (P = 0.0003), and higher systolic blood pressure 
(P = 0.01). Levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL were not 
significantly different in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (A1C >7%) have 
lower angiogenin levels than patients with well-controlled diabetes.
