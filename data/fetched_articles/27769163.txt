BACKGROUND: Higher plants have to cope with increasing concentrations of 
pollutants of both natural and anthropogenic origin. Given their capacity to 
concentrate and metabolize various compounds including pollutants, plants can be 
used to treat environmental problems - a process called phytoremediation. 
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the stabilization, the extraction, 
the accumulation and partial or complete degradation of pollutants by plants 
remain poorly understood.
RESULTS: Here, we determined the molecular events involved in the early plant 
response to phenanthrene, used as a model of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A 
transcriptomic and a metabolic analysis strongly suggest that energy 
availability is the crucial limiting factor leading to high and rapid 
transcriptional reprogramming that can ultimately lead to death. We show that 
the accumulation of phenanthrene in leaves inhibits electron transfer and 
photosynthesis within a few minutes, probably disrupting energy transformation.
CONCLUSION: This kinetic analysis improved the resolution of the transcriptome 
in the initial plant response to phenanthrene, identifying genes that are 
involved in primary processes set up to sense and detoxify this pollutant but 
also in molecular mechanisms used by the plant to cope with such harmful stress. 
The identification of first events involved in plant response to phenanthrene is 
a key step in the selection of candidates for further functional 
characterization, with the prospect of engineering efficient ecological 
detoxification systems for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
