Pathological changes of the cochlea and hearing loss have been well addressed in 
Waardenburg syndrome (WS). However, the vestibular organ malformation in WS is 
still largely unknown. In this study, the differentiation and development of 
vestibular sensory epithelium and vestibular function caused by SOX10 mutation, 
a critical gene induces WS, have been studied in minature pig model. 
Degeneration of vestibular hair cells was found in this Sox10 mutation porcine 
model. Inner ear phenotype of the SOX10+/R109W miniature pigs showed cochlear 
abnormalities as well as saccular hypofunction. In the mutant pigs, no prominent 
dissimilarity was shown in the bone structure of the semicircular canals. 
However, the saccular membrane was collapsed, and the infusion of stereocilia of 
the hair cells was observed. There were no dark cells in the utricles in the 
mutant pigs. The density of the utricular hair cells was also significantly 
lower in the mutant pigs compared to the wild type. Our study demonstrated that 
the SOX10 gene and melanocytes play important roles in the vestibular organ 
development. Sox10 mutation disrupts the KIT-DCT signaling pathway, affects the 
development of melanocytes, and leads to vestibule morphogenesis.
