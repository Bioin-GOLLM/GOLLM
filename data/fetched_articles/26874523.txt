Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a group of genetic disorders caused by mutations 
of XP-associated genes, resulting in impairment of DNA repair. XP patients 
frequently exhibit neurological degeneration, but the underlying mechanism is 
unknown, in part due to lack of proper disease models. Here, we generated 
patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) harboring mutations in 
five different XP genes including XPA, XPB, XPC, XPG, and XPV. These iPSCs were 
further differentiated to neural cells, and their susceptibility to DNA damage 
stress was investigated. Mutation of XPA in either neural stem cells (NSCs) or 
neurons resulted in severe DNA damage repair defects, and these neural cells 
with mutant XPA were hyper-sensitive to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Thus, 
XP-mutant neural cells represent valuable tools to clarify the molecular 
mechanisms of neurological abnormalities in the XP patients.
