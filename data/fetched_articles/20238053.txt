We have recently developed transgenic X. laevis models of retinitis pigmentosa 
based on the rhodopsin P23H mutation in the context of rhodopsin cDNAs derived 
from several different species. The mutant rhodopsin in these animals is 
expressed at low levels, with levels of export from the endoplasmic reticulum to 
the outer segment that depend on the cDNA context. Retinal degeneration in these 
models demonstrates varying degrees of light dependence, with the highest light 
dependence coinciding with the highest ER export efficiency. Rescue of light 
dependent retinal degeneration by dark rearing is in turn dependent on the 
capacity of the mutant rhodopsin to bind chromophore. Our results indicate that 
rhodopsin chromophore can act in vivo as a pharmacological chaperone for P23H 
rhodopsin, and that light-dependent retinal degeneration caused by P23H 
rhodopsin is due to reduced chromophore binding.
