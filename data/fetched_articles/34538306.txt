Children usually present with milder symptoms of COVID-19 as compared with 
adults. Supportive care alone is appropriate for most children with COVID-19. 
Antiviral therapy may be required for those with severe or critical diseases. 
Currently there has been a rapid development of vaccines globally to prevent 
COVID-19 and several vaccines are being evaluated in children and adolescents. 
Currently, only the Pfizer-BioNTech messenger RNA vaccine is approved for 
emergency authorization use in the pediatric population ages 16 years and older.
