BACKGROUND: SMARCB1-deficient malignancies can arise in various sites. We 
describe a novel primary SMARCB1-deficient carcinoma of skin (SDCS) and 
characterize SMARCB1 mutations in non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC).
METHODS: Cases underwent immunophenotyping and targeted exome sequencing 
(MSK-IMPACT) assay interrogating somatic mutations in 468 cancer-related genes. 
The MSK-IMPACT database from 2014 to 2020 encompassing 55, 000 cases was 
searched for NMSC with SMARCB1 mutations.
RESULTS: SDCS arose on the scalp of an 18-year-old woman showing homozygous 
SMARCB1 deletion with a LATS2 G963E variant. Another case arose on the temple of 
a 76-year-old man harboring a SMARCB1 W206* mutation associated with loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH), 59 concurrent mutations, and a UV mutation signature 
(UV-MS). Both tumors exhibited INI1 loss, positive CK5/6, p40, p63, and 
claudin-4 with negative CD34. Of 378 NMSC cases, including 370 carcinomas, 7 
SMARCB1-mutated tumors were identified: 3 squamous cell, 3 Merkel cell, and one 
basal cell carcinoma. Six showed UV-MS. Five INI1-interrogated cases retained 
protein expression suggesting they were SMARCB1-proficient.
CONCLUSIONS: SDCS can be clinically aggressive, harbor SMARCB1 homozygous 
deletions or truncating SMARCB1 mutations associated with LOH, and can occur 
with or without UV-MS. Overall, SMARCB1 mutations in NMSC are rare with most 
being of undetermined significance and associated with retained INI1 and UV-MS.
