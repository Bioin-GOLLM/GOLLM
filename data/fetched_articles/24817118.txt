Eukaryotic mitotic entry is controlled by Cdk1, which is activated by the Cdc25 
phosphatase and inhibited by Wee1 tyrosine kinase, a target of the ubiquitin 
proteasome pathway. Here we use a reporter of Wee1 degradation, 
K328M-Wee1-luciferase, to screen a kinase-directed chemical library. Hit 
profiling identified CK1δ-dependent Wee1 degradation. Small-molecule CK1δ 
inhibitors specifically disrupted Wee1 destruction and arrested HeLa cell 
proliferation. Pharmacological inhibition, siRNA knockdown, or conditional 
deletion of CK1δ also reduced Wee1 turnover. Thus, these studies define a 
previously unappreciated role for CK1δ in controlling the cell cycle.
