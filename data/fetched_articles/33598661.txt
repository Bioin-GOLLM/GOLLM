Evaluating redox homeostasis involves gauging the levels of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) directly in tissues and cells. 
The brain is especially metabolically active and is particularly vulnerable to 
excessive ROS and RNS. Here, we describe a methodology to quantitatively measure 
ROS in ex vivo mouse brain slices at baseline and after neural stimulation. 
Evaluating ROS in slices provides a more complete picture of neural redox 
signaling than when measured in isolated neurons or astrocytes. For complete 
details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Vasavda 
et al. (2019).
