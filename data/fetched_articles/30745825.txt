UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) catalyzes the conversion of UDP-glucose to 
UDP-glucuronic acid by NAD+-dependent two-fold oxidation. Despite extensive 
investigation into the catalytic mechanism of UGDH, the previously proposed 
mechanisms regarding the first-step oxidation are somewhat controversial and 
inconsistent with some biochemical evidence, which instead supports a mechanism 
involving an NAD+-dependent bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) 
reaction. To verify this speculation, the essential Cys residue of Streptococcus 
zooepidemicus UGDH (SzUGDH) was changed to an Ala residue, and the resulting 
Cys260Ala mutant and SzUGDH were then co-expressed in vivo via a 
single-crossover homologous recombination method. Contrary to the previously 
proposed mechanisms, which predict the formation of the capsular polysaccharide 
hyaluronan, the resulting strain instead produced an amide derivative of 
hyaluronan, as validated via proteinase K digestion, ninhydrin reaction, FT-IR 
and NMR. This result is compatible with the NAD+-dependent SN2 mechanism.
