Transient expression of wild-type N-methyl-D-aspartate, NMDAR1-1a/NMDAR2A 
heteromeric receptors, in mammalian cells yields cell death which was prevented 
by the inclusion of NMDA receptor antagonists in the cell culture media 
post-transfection. Transient expression of mutant NMDAR1-1a (N598Q)/NMDAR2A 
receptors resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of cell death 
post-transfection. This mutation has been shown to reduce the Ca2+ permeability 
of cloned NMDA receptors. Thus these results provide indirect evidence for cell 
death via an NMDA receptor, Ca(2+)-mediated mechanism.
