The absolute configuration of the title compound, C(14)H(13)NO(2)S, was assigned 
from the synthesis and confirmed by the structure determination. The central 
six-membered ring of the indolizine system adopts an envelope conformation, the 
greatest deviation from the mean plane of the ring being 0.459 (2) Å for the N 
atom. The benzothieno system is planar [mean deviation = 0.009 (2) Å]. In the 
crystal structure, mol-ecules form chains parallel to the b axis via 
inter-molecular O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds.
