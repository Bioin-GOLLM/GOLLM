The transmembrane adaptor PAG (Cbp) has been proposed to mediate membrane 
recruitment of Csk, a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase playing a critical 
inhibitory role during T cell activation, by inactivating membrane-associated 
Src kinases. However, this model has not been validated by genetic evidence. 
Here, we demonstrate that PAG-deficient mice display enhanced T cell activation 
responses in effector, but not in naive, T cells. PAG-deficient mice also have 
augmented T cell-dependent autoimmunity and greater resistance to T cell anergy. 
Interestingly, in the absence of PAG, Csk becomes more associated with 
alternative partners; i.e., phosphatase PTPN22 and Dok adaptors. Combining PAG 
deficiency with PTPN22 or Dok adaptor deficiency further enhances effector 
T cell responses. Unlike PAG, Cbl ubiquitin ligases inhibit the activation of 
naive, but not of effector, T cells. Thus, Csk-associating PAG is a critical 
component of the inhibitory machinery controlling effector T cell activation in 
cooperation with PTPN22 and Dok adaptors.
