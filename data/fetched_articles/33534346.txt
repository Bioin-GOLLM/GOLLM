OBJECTIVES: Ethnic disparities in hypertension prevalence are well documented, 
though the influence of genetic ancestry is unclear. The aim of this study was 
to evaluate associations of geographic genetic ancestry with hypertension and 
underlying blood pressure traits.
METHODS: We tested genetically inferred ancestry proportions from five 1000 
Genomes reference populations (GBR, PEL, YRI, CHB, and LWK) for association with 
four continuous blood pressure (BP) traits (SBP, DBP, PP, MAP) and the 
dichotomous outcomes hypertension and apparent treatment-resistant hypertension 
in 220 495 European American, 59 927 African American, and 21 273 Hispanic 
American individuals from the Million Veteran Program. Ethnicity stratified 
results were meta-analyzed to report effect estimates per 10% difference for a 
given ancestry proportion in all samples.
RESULTS: Percentage GBR was negatively associated with BP (P = 2.13 × 10-19, 
7.92 × 10-8, 4.41 × 10-11, and 3.57 × 10-13 for SBP, DBP, PP, and MAP, 
respectively; coefficient range -0.10 to -0.21 mmHg per 10% increase in ancestry 
proportion) and was protective against hypertension [P = 2.59 × 10-5, odds ratio 
(OR) = 0.98] relative to other ancestries. YRI percentage was positively 
associated with BP (P = 1.63 × 10-23, 1.94 × 10-26, 0.012, and 3.26 × 10-29 for 
SBP, DBP, PP, and MAP, respectively; coefficient range 0.06-0.32 mmHg per 10% 
increase in ancestry proportion) and was positively associated with hypertension 
risk (P = 3.10 × 10-11, OR = 1.04) and apparent treatment-resistant hypertension 
risk (P = 1.86 × 10-4, OR = 1.04) compared with other ancestries. Percentage PEL 
was inversely associated with DBP (P = 2.84 × 10-5, beta = -0.11 mmHg per 10% 
increase in ancestry proportion).
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that risk for BP traits varies 
significantly by genetic ancestry. Our findings provide insight into the 
geographic origin of genetic factors underlying hypertension risk and establish 
that a portion of BP trait ethnic disparities are because of genetic differences 
between ancestries.
