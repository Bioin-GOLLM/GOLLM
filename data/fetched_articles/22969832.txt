Polyhedral formulations based on Rasayana therapy described in Charaka Samhita 
showed remarkable improvement in quality of life of various cancer patients who 
have been found to be refractory or poor responders to modern chemotherapy and 
radiation treatment. One of the most recent novel herbomineral preparation, 
Las01 prepared absolutely as per the instruction given in the ancient Ayurvedic 
literature has been found to be effective as a potent anticancer drug in the 
human cell lines, the MCF-7 and Hela cancer cell lines. This novel preparation 
of Las01 is also found to be devoid of toxicity both in animals as well as in 
human subjects, which is the main drawback of chemotherapeutic agents used in 
modern system of medicine. Our results warrant multicentric clinical trials on a 
large scale which seems to be a future promising drug to cure incurables cancer 
patients.
