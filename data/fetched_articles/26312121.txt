Trauma is a major public health problem worldwide. Infectious complications, 
sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) remain important causes 
for morbidity and mortality in patients who survive the initial trauma. There is 
increasing evidence for the role of genetic variation in the innate immune 
system on infectious complications in severe trauma patients. We describe a 
trauma patient with multiple infectious complications caused by multiple 
micro-organisms leading to prolonged hospital stay with numerous treatments. 
This patient had multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MBL2, 
MASP2, FCN2 and TLR2 genes, most likely contributing to increased susceptibility 
and severity of infectious disease.
