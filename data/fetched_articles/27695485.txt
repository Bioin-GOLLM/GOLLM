INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases are positively correlated with periodontal 
disease. However, the molecular mechanisms linking atherosclerosis and 
periodontal infection are not clear. This study aimed to determine whether 
Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) altered the expression of 
genes regulating cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in the presence of 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: THP-1-derived macrophages were exposed to different 
concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 µg/ml) of LPS in the presence of 50 µg/ml native LDL. 
Macrophages were also incubated with 1 µg/ml LPS for varying times (0, 24, 48, 
or 72 h) in the presence of native LDL. Foam cell formation was determined by 
oil red O staining and cholesterol content quantification. CD36, lectin-like 
oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1), ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1), and acetyl CoA 
acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) expression levels were measured by western blot and 
qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: Foam cell formation was induced in a time- and concentration-dependent 
manner as assessed by both morphological and biochemical criteria. Pg-LPS caused 
downregulation of CD36 and ABCG1 but upregulation of ACAT1, while LOX-1 
expression was not affected (p = 0.137).
CONCLUSIONS: Pg-LPS appears to be an important link in the development of 
atherosclerosis by mechanisms targeting cholesterol homeostasis, namely, excess 
cholesterol ester formation via ACAT1 and reduced cellular cholesterol efflux 
via ABCG1.
