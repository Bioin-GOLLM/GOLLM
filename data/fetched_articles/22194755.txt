Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease that may be caused by 
more than 1000 different mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. We describe the case of a CF patient who was 
initially diagnosed at 16 years of age after presenting with mild respiratory 
compromise and pancreatic sufficiency. When genetic testing was first performed 
using a CF mutation panel, only a single F508del CFTR allele was identified. We 
subsequently performed testing, which revealed a previously unreported mutation: 
A457P (p.Ala457Pro, c.1369G>C). The patient's clinical course through adulthood 
is described, and genotype-phenotype correlation is discussed. The A457P 
mutation appears to confer a relatively mild phenotype, as is usually observed 
with CFTR class IV-VI defects. With the advent of more comprehensive and widely 
available genetic testing techniques, identification of CF genotypes in patients 
with milder disease variants may help stratify patients for targeted therapy and 
prevent late complications of the disease.
