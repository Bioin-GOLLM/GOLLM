Autosomal recessive (AR) non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is the most common 
form of hereditary deafness. Mutations in the gap junction protein beta 2 (GJB2) 
gene encoding connexin 26 (Cx26) account for about 50% of cases of ARNSHL. In 
the current study, a combination of exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing in a 
Chinese Dong family with ARNSHL allowed identification of a novel compound 
heterozygous mutation c.240G>C(p. Q80H)/C.109G>A(p.V37I) in exon 2 of the GJB2 
gene, which co-segregated with the disease phenotype in this family and was not 
evident in 100 healthy controls. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the two 
mutations in the GJB2 gene were probably pathogenic. Results indicated that the 
compound heterozygous variants, p.Q80H and p.V37I, in the GJB2 gene are 
associated with ARNSHL. The Q80H variant was initially identified in patients of 
Dong Chinese origin with NSHL. The current results broaden the spectrum of GJB2 
mutations responsible for NSHL and have important implications for molecular 
diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling for this family.
