BACKGROUND: Aberrant hypermethylation of cellular genes is a common phenomenon 
to inactivate genes and promote tumorigenesis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS: Methyl binding domain (MBD)-ChIP sequencing of NPC cells, microarray 
data of NPC biopsies and gene ontology analysis were conducted to identify a 
potential tumor suppressor gene CLDN11 that was both hypermethylated and 
downregulated in NPC. Bisulfite sequencing, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry 
staining of the NPC clinical samples and addition of methylation inhibitor, 
5'azacytidine, in NPC cells were performed to verify the correlation between DNA 
hypermethylation and expression of CLDN11. Promoter reporter and EMSA assays 
were used to dissect the DNA region responsible for transcription activator 
binding and to confirm whether DNA methylation could affect activator's binding, 
respectively. CLDN11 was transiently overexpressed in NPC cells followed by cell 
proliferation, migration, invasion assays to characterize its biological roles. 
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and proteomic approach were carried out to 
identify novel interacting protein(s) and the binding domain of CLDN11. 
Anti-tumor activity of the CLDN11 was elucidated by in vitro functional assay.
RESULTS: A tight junction gene, CLDN11, was identified as differentially 
hypermethylated gene in NPC. High methylation percentage of CLDN11 promoter in 
paired NPC clinical samples was correlated with low mRNA expression level. 
Immunohistochemistry staining of NPC paired samples tissue array demonstrated 
that CLDN11 protein expression was relatively low in NPC tumors. Transcription 
activator GATA1 bound to CLDN11 promoter region - 62 to - 53 and its DNA binding 
activity was inhibited by DNA methylation. Re-expression of CLDN11 reduced cell 
migration and invasion abilities in NPC cells. By co-immunoprecipitation and 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS, tubulin alpha-1b 
(TUBA1B) and beta-3 (TUBB3), were identified as the novel CLDN11-interacting 
proteins. CLDN11 interacted with these two tubulins through its intracellular 
loop and C-terminus. Furthermore, these domains were required for 
CLDN11-mediated cell migration inhibition. Treatment with a tubulin 
polymerization inhibitor, nocodazole, blocked NPC cell migration.
CONCLUSIONS: CLDN11 is a hypermethylated and downregulated gene in NPC. Through 
interacting with microtubules TUBA1B and TUBB3, CLDN11 blocks the polymerization 
of tubulins and cell migration activity. Thus, CLDN11 functions as a potential 
tumor suppressor gene and silencing of CLDN11 by DNA hypermethylation promotes 
NPC progression.
