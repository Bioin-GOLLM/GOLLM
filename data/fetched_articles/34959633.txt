Adalimumab (ADA) is a human anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) monoclonal 
antibody used in inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease (CD). 
Vitamin-D (VD) is important for biological functions, such as the modulation of 
expression of genes encoding enzymes and transporters involved in drug 
metabolism and transport. ADA trough levels were associated with VD 
concentrations in patients with IBD, but no data are present in the literature 
concerning VD pathway-related gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
affecting clinical outcomes. For this reason, the aim of this study was to 
evaluate the ability of VD-related genetics to predict clinical remission at 3 
and 12 months in patients affected by CD treated with ADA. Patients affected by 
CD were included in this study. SNPs in CYP27B1, CYP24A1, GC, and VDR genes were 
analyzed through real-time PCR. A total of 63 patients were enrolled. 
Calprotectin, hemoglobin, and C-reactive protein levels were influenced by SNPs 
in VDR, CYP27B1, and GC genes. After 3 months of therapy, clinical remission was 
predicted by smoke, systemic steroids, and VDR BsmI, whereas at 12 months by GC 
1296AA/AC and VD supplementation. This study reports the association between VD 
pathway-related genetics and ADA treatment. Further studies are needed to 
confirm these promising data.
