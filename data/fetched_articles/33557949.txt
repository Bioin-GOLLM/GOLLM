BACKGROUND: Synaptic failure is one of the principal events associated with 
cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preservation of existing 
synapses and prevention of synaptic loss are promising strategies to preserve 
cognitive function in AD patients. As a potent natural anti-oxidant, 
anti-amyloid, and anti-inflammatory polyphenol, curcumin (Cur) shows great 
promise as a therapy for AD. However, hydrophobicity of natural Cur limits its 
solubility, stability, bioavailability, and clinical utility for AD therapy. We 
have demonstrated that solid lipid curcumin particles (SLCP) have greater 
therapeutic potential than natural Cur in vitro and in vivo models of AD. In the 
present study, we have investigated whether SLCP has any preservative role on 
affected dendritic spines and synaptic markers in 5xFAD mice.
METHODS: Six- and 12-month-old 5xFAD and age-matched wild-type mice received 
oral administration of SLCP (100 mg/kg body weight) or equivalent amounts of 
vehicle for 2 months. Neuronal morphology, neurodegeneration, and amyloid plaque 
load were investigated from prefrontal cortex (PFC), entorhinal cortex (EC), 
CA1, CA3, and the subicular complex (SC). In addition, the dendritic spine 
density from apical and basal branches was studied by Golgi-Cox stain. Further, 
synaptic markers, such as synaptophysin, PSD95, Shank, Homer, Drebrin, 
Kalirin-7, CREB, and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) were studied using Western 
blots. Finally, cognitive and motor functions were assessed using open-field, 
novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tasks after treatment 
with SLCP.
RESULTS: We observed an increased number of pyknotic and degenerated cells in 
all these brain areas in 5xFAD mice and SLCP treatment partially protected 
against those losses. Decrease in dendritic arborization and dendritic spine 
density from primary, secondary, and tertiary apical and basal branches were 
observed in PFC, EC, CA1, and CA3 in both 6- and 12-month-old 5xFAD mice, and 
SLCP treatments partially preserved the normal morphology of these dendritic 
spines. In addition, pre- and postsynaptic protein markers were also restored by 
SLCP treatment. Furthermore, SLCP treatment improved NOR and cognitive function 
in 5xFAD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings indicate that use of SLCP exerts 
neuroprotective properties by decreasing amyloid plaque burden, preventing 
neuronal death, and preserving dendritic spine density and synaptic markers in 
the 5xFAD mice.
