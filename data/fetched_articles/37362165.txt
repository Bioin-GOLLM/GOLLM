A decade since the discovery of insulin, the increasing prevalence of type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has underscored the prevailing inequalities in the 
provision of essential care for T1DM worldwide. However, the details on the 
availability of insulin types and associated medical devices remain unclear. A 
cross-sectional electronic survey was distributed across a global network of 
pediatric societies under the umbrella of the International Pediatric 
Association (IPA). Access to and availability of pediatric diabetes care were 
investigated using standardized questions. Responses from 25 of 132 pediatric 
societies across six regions were included. Pediatric endocrinologists typically 
manage T1DM together with pediatricians or adult endocrinologists. Nonetheless, 
24% of the respondents reported pediatricians to be the sole healthcare 
professionals. According to the respondents, the patients were either partially 
or completely responsible for payments of insulin (40%), A1C (24%), C-peptide 
(28%), and antibody testing for diagnosis (28%). Government support is generally 
available for insulin, but this was merely 20% for insulin pumps and 12% for 
continuous glucose monitors. There are considerable disparities in the access, 
availability, and affordability of diabetes testing, medications, and support 
between countries with significant out-of-pocket payments for care. Country- and 
region-specific improvements to national programs are necessary to achieve 
optimal pediatric diabetes care globally.
