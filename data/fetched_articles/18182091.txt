OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of ghrelin and polymorphisms of 
ghrelin/obestatin gene in children with short stature.
METHODS: A total of 117 GH deficient (GHD) and 81 idiopathic short stature (ISS) 
children were studied. The controls consisted of 125 age and gender-matched 
healthy children. The Arg51Gln, Leu72Met and Gln90Leu polymorphisms were 
genotyped using MassArray and total plasma ghrelin was measured by 
radioimmunoassay.
RESULTS: In this study, the frequency of the Arg51Gln polymorphism was very low 
(0% in controls and 1.0% in patients). The frequency of the Gln90Leu 
polymorphism was 1.6% in controls and 0.5% in patients, respectively. Higher 
frequencies of Leu72Met (34.4% in controls and 39.9% in patients) and Met72Met 
genotypes (4.0% in controls and 2.0% in patients) were found. The differences in 
the Arg51Gln, Leu72Met or Gln90Leu genotypes and allele frequencies between 
patients and controls were not significant. Also, there were no significant 
differences in the Leu72Met genotypes and allele frequencies between GHD and ISS 
subgroups. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics and 
biochemistry markers (including ghrelin levels) among the different genotypes of 
Leu72Met. However, plasma ghrelin levels in the GHD group were significantly 
lower than those of controls (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ghrelin may have a role in GH secretion 
and controlling growth. Lower ghrelin levels, but not ghrelin/obestatin 
polymorphism, might contribute to GHD.
