A novel and broadly applicable strategy combining site-directed mutagenesis and 
DNA assembly for constructing seamless viral chimeras is described using 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) as an exemplar. Full-length HCV genomic cloning 
cassettes, which contained flexibly situated restriction endonuclease sites, 
were prepared via a single, site-directed mutagenesis reaction and digested to 
receive PCR-amplified virus envelope genes by In-Fusion cloning. Using this 
method, we were able to construct gene-shuttle cassettes for generation of cell 
culture-infectious JFH-1-based chimeras containing genotype 1-3 E1E2 genes. 
Importantly, using this method we also show that E1E2 clones that were not able 
to support cell entry in the HCV pseudoparticle assay did confer entry when 
shuttled into the chimeric cell culture chimera system. This method can be 
easily applied to other genes of study and other viruses and, as such, will 
greatly simplify reverse genetics studies of variable viruses.
