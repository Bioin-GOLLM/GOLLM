OBJECTIVE: To investigate PAX4 gene polymorphism and its association with islet 
autoantibody-negative patients with ketosis-prone diabetes in Chinese Han 
population.
METHODS: We screened the variation of exon 3 and 9 within PAX4 gene by 
denaturing high performance liquid chromatography(DHPLC) in 112 non-diabetes 
control subjects (NC group) and 141 patients with ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD 
group), who were both negative for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GAD-Ab) 
as well as protein tyrosine phosphatase antibody (IA-2Ab). The sequences of 
abnormal peaks were analyzed by DNA-sequencing. The A1168C single nucleotide 
polymorphism in PAX4 gene was genotyped using polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 308 non-diabetic 
control subjects and 141 KPD patients.
RESULTS: No variation was discovered in PAX4 gene exon 3 both in the patients 
and in the controls. There was a single nucleotide polymorphism locus A1168C in 
the PAX4 gene exon 9, which induced missence mutation P321H (rs712701). No 
significant difference was observed in the genotype and allele frequencies of 
A1168C polymorphism between KPD patients and control subjects (P=0.532, 0.426). 
The difference was detected in the CC genotype and C allele frequencies in the 
KPD group when patients were stratified by gender (P=0.009,0.028). According to 
age at diagnosis, the difference was observed in the CC genotype and C allele 
frequencies between <20 years old and > or = 20 years old in the KPD group 
(P=0.034,0.032). The level of FCP in the CC genotype group was significantly 
higher than that of FCP in AA genotype group (P=0.005).
CONCLUSION: A1168C polymorphism in PAX4 gene may not play an essential role in 
the genetic susceptibility of the islet autoantibody-negative KPD in Chinese Han 
population. However, A1168C variation may contribute to the predisposition to 
the male or < 20 years old patients with islet autoantibody-negative KPD.
