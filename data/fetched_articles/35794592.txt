BACKGROUND: According to Waddington's epigenetic landscape concept, the 
differentiation process can be illustrated by a cell akin to a ball rolling down 
from the top of a hill (proliferation state) and crossing furrows before 
stopping in basins or "attractor states" to reach its stable differentiated 
state. However, it is now clear that some committed cells can retain a certain 
degree of plasticity and reacquire phenotypical characteristics of a more 
pluripotent cell state. In line with this dynamic model, we have previously 
shown that differentiating cells (chicken erythrocytic progenitors (T2EC)) 
retain for 24 h the ability to self-renew when transferred back in self-renewal 
conditions. Despite those intriguing and promising results, the underlying 
molecular state of those "reverting" cells remains unexplored. The aim of the 
present study was therefore to molecularly characterize the T2EC reversion 
process by combining advanced statistical tools to make the most of single-cell 
transcriptomic data. For this purpose, T2EC, initially maintained in a 
self-renewal medium (0H), were induced to differentiate for 24H (24H 
differentiating cells); then, a part of these cells was transferred back to the 
self-renewal medium (48H reverting cells) and the other part was maintained in 
the differentiation medium for another 24H (48H differentiating cells). For each 
time point, cell transcriptomes were generated using scRT-qPCR and scRNAseq.
RESULTS: Our results showed a strong overlap between 0H and 48H reverting cells 
when applying dimensional reduction. Moreover, the statistical comparison of 
cell distributions and differential expression analysis indicated no significant 
differences between these two cell groups. Interestingly, gene pattern 
distributions highlighted that, while 48H reverting cells have gene expression 
pattern more similar to 0H cells, they are not completely identical, which 
suggest that for some genes a longer delay may be required for the cells to 
fully recover. Finally, sparse PLS (sparse partial least square) analysis showed 
that only the expression of 3 genes discriminates 48H reverting and 0H cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, we show that reverting cells return to an earlier 
molecular state almost identical to undifferentiated cells and demonstrate a 
previously undocumented physiological and molecular plasticity during the 
differentiation process, which most likely results from the dynamic behavior of 
the underlying molecular network.
