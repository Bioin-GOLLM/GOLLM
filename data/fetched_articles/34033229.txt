BACKGROUND: Thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) are relatively rare malignant 
thoracic tumors. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune infiltration play 
important roles in tumorigenesis.
METHODS: Research data was obtained using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
database to evaluate the landscape of tumor mutations, related factors, and 
relationship of prognosis. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to evaluate immune 
cell infiltration in TETs and its relationship with TMB. Immune-related 
differentially expressed genes (irDEGs) were identified. Hub irDEGs 
independently related to prognosis were analyzed using univariate and 
multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. A survival signature was 
constructed from hub irDEGs.
RESULTS: A total of 122 patients were included in this study. GTF2I was the most 
common gene mutation. Higher TMB was significantly associated with the later 
stage, more advanced pathological type, and older age. The overall survival (OS) 
of patients in the low-TMB group was significantly better. There was no 
significant correlation between TMB levels and PD-L1 expression. Enrichment 
analysis showed that DEGs were mainly involved in the P13K-Akt signaling 
pathway. There were significant differences in macrophage and other types of 
immune cell infiltration between the high- and low-TMB groups. CCR5, FASLG, and 
CD79A independently relating to prognosis were screened from 391 irDEGs. The 
low-risk group had a significantly better prognosis than the high-risk group 
based on the signature, which has a good predictive effect on OS.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, TETs patients with high TMB had a significantly poor 
prognosis and an immune-related gene signature was found to effectively evaluate 
the long-term prognosis.
