BACKGROUND: Inconsistent results were reported in recent literature regarding 
the association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T/A1298C 
polymorphisms and the susceptibility of congenital heart disease (CHD). In this 
study, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the associations by employing 
multiple analytical methods.
METHODS: Literature search was performed and published articles were obtained 
from PubMed, Embase and CNKI databases based on the exclusion and inclusion 
criteria. Data were extracted from eligible studies and the crude odds ratios 
and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using 
random or fix effects model to evaluate the associations between the MTHFR 
C677T/A1298C polymorphisms and CHD development. Subgroup based analysis was 
performed by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, ethnicity, types of CHD, source of 
control and sample size.
RESULTS: Twenty-four eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. 
Significant association was found between fetal MTHFR C677T polymorphism and CHD 
development in all genetic models. The pooled ORs and 95% CIs in all genetic 
models indicated that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was significantly associated with 
CHD in Asian, but not Caucasian in subgroup analysis. The maternal MTHFR C677T 
polymorphism was not associated with CHD except for recessive model. Moreover, 
neither maternal nor fetal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was associated with CHD.
CONCLUSION: The fetal MTHFR C677T polymorphism may increase the susceptibility 
to CHD. Fetal MTHFR C677T polymorphism was more likely to affect Asian fetus 
than Caucasian. The MTHFR A1298C polymorphism may not be a risk of congenital 
heart disease.
