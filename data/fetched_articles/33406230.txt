Various in vivo mutagenesis methods have been developed to facilitate fast and 
efficient continuous evolution of proteins in cells. However, they either modify 
the DNA region that does not match the target gene, or suffer from low mutation 
rates. Here, we report a mutator, eMutaT7 (enhanced MutaT7), with very fast in 
vivo mutation rate and high gene-specificity in Escherichia coli. eMutaT7, a 
cytidine deaminase fused to an orthogonal RNA polymerase, can introduce up to ∼4 
mutations per 1 kb per day, rivalling the rate in typical in vitro mutagenesis 
for directed evolution of proteins, and promotes rapid continuous evolution of 
model proteins for antibiotic resistance and allosteric activation. eMutaT7 
provides a very simple and tunable method for continuous directed evolution of 
proteins, and suggests that the fusion of new DNA-modifying enzymes to the 
orthogonal RNA polymerase is a promising strategy to explore the expanded 
sequence space without compromising gene specificity.
