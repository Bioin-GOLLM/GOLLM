OBJECTIVE: To construct human coagulation factor Ⅸ mini-gene (Mini-hF9) and some 
nonsense mutants, detect the levels of the Mini-hF9 mRNA, and analyze the 
molecular mechanism of microRNA125 regulating F9 gene with nonsense mutation.
METHODS: Three nonsense mutants were obtained by using PCR mutagenesis to 
analyze the mechanism of plasma thromboplastin component recognition. The 
Mini-hF9 gene mRNA levels were detected by Real-time PCR in mammalian cells 
co-transfected with nonsense mutant expression vectors and miR-125 mimics.
RESULTS: Mini-hF9 gene was constructed successfully and cloned into the 
mammalian expression vector. The only normal transcript was detected in cells 
transfected with the Mini-hF9 gene expression vectors. Three nonsense mutants, 
M1 (nt 34 G>T in Exon 7), M2 (nt 52 G>T in Exon 7) and M3 (nt 85 G>T in Exon 7), 
were obtained by using PCR mutagenesis. The levels of the Mini-hF9 mRNA 
decreased to 14.1% (t=15.464, P=0.004) in M1 and 22.4% (t=15.755, P=0.004) in M2 
mutants after transfection, respectively. It was proved to be caused by 
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in CHX experiment. The levels of Mini-hF9 
mRNA increased to 1.70 times (t=-4.883, P=0.039) and 2.40 times (t=-17.537, 
P=0.003) in M1 mutant after miR-125a or miR-125b mimics treatment, respectively. 
The levels of Mini-hF9 mRNA increased to 2.02 times (t=-19.264, P=0.003) and 
2.07 times (t=-9.158, P=0.012) in M2 mutant after miR-125a or miR-125b mimics 
treatment, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Nonsense mutant location is a key determinant for triggering NMD. 
MicroRNA125 could improve the stability of Mini-hF9 mRNA in M1 and M2 mutants by 
repressing NMD. MicroRNA125, a short non-coding RNA molecule, could be a 
potential therapeutic target in conditions caused by the NMD pathway.

目的: 构建人凝血因子Ⅸ小基因（Mini-hF9）及无义突变体，检测其mRNA表达水平，分析microRNA125对无义突变的F9基因表达调控的分子机制。
方法: 利用PCR定点突变技术构建若干无义突变的人Mini-hF9并转染哺乳动物细胞HEK293T等，同时转染miR-125模拟物，通过实时荧光定量PCR 
(q-PCR）检测Mini-hF9基因mRNA表达水平。
结果: 成功构建了Mini-hF9并在细胞中正确剪接。成功构建了无义突变体M1 (nt 34 G>T in Exon 7）、M2（nt 52 G>T in 
Exon 7）和M3 (nt 85 G>T in Exon 
7）。M1和M2突变体中Mini-hF9基因mRNA表达水平分别为野生型的14.1%（t=15.464，P=0.004）和22.4%（t=15.755，P=0.004），通过放线菌酮处理实验证实这是由于无义介导的mRNA降解（nonsense-mediated 
mRNA decay, 
NMD）所致。分别转染miR-125a模拟物和miR-125b模拟物后，M1突变体中Mini-hF9基因mRNA水平分别升高到1.70倍（t=−4.883，P=0.039）和2.40倍（t=−17.537，P=0.003），M2突变体Mini-hF9mRNA水平分别升高到2.02倍（t=−19.264，P=0.003）和2.07倍（t=−9.158，P=0.012）。
结论: 无义突变发生的位置是触发NMD途径的一个关键因素；microRNA125能够通过抑制NMD途径提高无义突变的凝血因子Ⅸ的mRNA水平。
