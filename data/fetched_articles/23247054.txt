A novel electrochemical DNA biosensor for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
analysis was developed. In this work, an oligonucleotide-incorporated nonfouling 
surface (ONS) was constructed to resist nonspecific absorption. The biosensor 
was developed using a 16-electrode array for high-throughput SNP analysis. The 
proposed strategy was primarily based on specific oligonucleotide ligation. 
Fully matched target DNA templated the ligation between a capture probe 
assembled on gold electrodes and a tandem signal probe with a biotin moiety that 
could capture avidin-horseradish peroxidase and sequentially generate a 
catalysed amperometric signal. A pre-core mutation in the hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) genome at G1896A and two adjacent polymorphisms in the human CYP2C19 
genome at C680T and G681A were analysed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
products were used as real-life samples and analysed. Our results showed that 
10% of a single-mismatched mutant gene was clearly distinguished with a current 
signal 16 times higher than that of the blank sample, demonstrating the 
selectivity and practicability of the multiplexed electrochemical DNA biosensor.
