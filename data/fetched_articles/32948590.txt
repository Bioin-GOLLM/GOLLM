Cellular cross-talk between ubiquitination and other posttranslational 
modifications contributes to the regulation of numerous processes. One example 
is ADP-ribosylation of the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin by the E3 
DTX3L/ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP9 heterodimer, but the mechanism remains 
elusive. Here, we show that independently of PARP9, the conserved 
carboxyl-terminal RING and DTC (Deltex carboxyl-terminal) domains of DTX3L and 
other human Deltex proteins (DTX1 to DTX4) catalyze ADP-ribosylation of 
ubiquitin's Gly76 Structural studies reveal a hitherto unknown function of the 
DTC domain in binding NAD+ Deltex RING domain recruits E2 thioesterified with 
ubiquitin and juxtaposes it with NAD+ bound to the DTC domain to facilitate 
ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin. This ubiquitin modification prevents its 
activation but is reversed by the linkage nonspecific deubiquitinases. Our study 
provides mechanistic insights into ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin by Deltex E3s 
and will enable future studies directed at understanding the increasingly 
complex network of ubiquitin cross-talk.
