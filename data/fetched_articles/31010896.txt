Two siblings, one male and one female, ages 6 and 13 yr old, have similar 
clinical features of global developmental delay, multiple congenital anomalies 
affecting the cardiac, genitourinary, and skeletal systems, and abnormal eye 
movements. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a homozygous splice variant 
(NM_014462.3:c.231+4A>C) in LSM1 that segregated with the phenotype in the 
family. LSM1 has a role in pre-mRNA splicing and degradation. Expression studies 
revealed absence of expression of the canonical isoform in the affected 
individuals. The Lsm1 knockout mice have a partially overlapping phenotype that 
affects the brain, heart, and eye. To our knowledge, LSM1 has not been 
associated with any human disorder; however, the tissue expression pattern, gene 
constraint, and the similarity of the phenotype in our patients and the knockout 
mice models suggest it has a role in the development of multiple organ systems 
in humans.
