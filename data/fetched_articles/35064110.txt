The mevalonate pathway plays a critical role in multiple cellular processes in 
both animals and plants. In plants, the products of this pathway impact growth 
and development, as well as the response to environmental stress. A forward 
genetic screen of Arabidopsis thaliana using Ca2+-imaging identified mevalonate 
kinase (MVK) as a critical component of plant purinergic signaling. MVK 
interacts directly with the plant extracellular ATP (eATP) receptor P2K1 and is 
phosphorylated by P2K1 in response to eATP. Mutation of P2K1-mediated 
phosphorylation sites in MVK eliminates the ATP-induced cytoplasmic calcium 
response, MVK enzymatic activity, and suppresses pathogen defense. The data 
demonstrate that the plasma membrane associated P2K1 directly impacts plant 
cellular metabolism by phosphorylation of MVK, a key enzyme in the mevalonate 
pathway. The results underline the importance of purinergic signaling in plants 
and the ability of eATP to influence the activity of a key metabolite pathway 
with global effects on plant metabolism.
