BACKGROUND: EGFR-mutant (EGFR-M) and ALK-positive (ALK-P)are common in malignant 
pleural effusion (MPE) with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
(MPE-NSCLC). The impact of thoracic tumor radiotherapy on survival in such 
patients remains unclear. We aimed to investigate whether thoracic tumor 
radiotherapy could improve overall survival (OS) in such patients.
METHODS: According to whether or not patients accepted thoracic tumor 
radiotherapy, 148 patients with EGFR-M or ALK-P MPE-NSCLC treated with targeted 
therapy were classified into two groups: DT group without thoracic tumor 
radiotherapy and DRT group with thoracic tumor radiotherapy. Propensity score 
matching (PSM) was performed to balance clinical baseline characteristics. 
Overall survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier, compared by log-rank test, and 
evaluated using Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Median survival time (MST) was 25 months versus 17 months in the DRT 
group and DT group. The OS rates at 1, 2, 3, 5 years in the DRT group and DT 
group were 75.0%, 52.8%, 26.8%, 11.1% and 64.5%, 28.4%, 9.2%, 1.8%, respectively 
(χ2  = 12.028, p = 0.001). Compared with DT group, the DRT group still had 
better survival after PSM (p = 0.007). Before and after PSM, factors associated 
with better OS through multivariable analysis were that thoracic tumor 
radiotherapy, radiotherapy, N0-2 , and ALK-TKIs. Grades 4-5 radiation toxicities 
were not observed in patients; 8 (11.6%) and 7 (10.1%) out of the DRT group 
suffered from Grade 3 radiation esophagitis and radiation pneumonitis, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results for EGFR-M or ALK-P MPE-NSCLC showed that thoracic tumor 
radiotherapy may be crucial factor in improving OS with acceptable toxicities. 
Potential biases should not be neglected: Further randomized controlled trials 
are necessary to confirm this result.
