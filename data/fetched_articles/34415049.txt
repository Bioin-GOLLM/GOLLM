BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination efficacy is reduced after hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) and patient factors determining vaccination outcomes 
are still poorly understood.
METHODS: We investigated the antibody response to seasonal influenza vaccination 
in 135 HSCT patients and 69 healthy volunteers (HVs) in a prospective 
observational multicenter cohort study. We identified patient factors associated 
with hemagglutination inhibition titers against A/California/2009/H1N1, 
A/Texas/2012/H3N2, and B/Massachusetts/2012 by multivariable regression on the 
observed titer levels and on seroconversion/seroprotection categories for 
comparison.
RESULTS: Both regression approaches yielded consistent results but regression on 
titers estimated associations with higher precision. HSCT patients required 2 
vaccine doses to achieve average responses comparable to a single dose in HVs. 
Prevaccination titers were positively associated with time after 
transplantation, confirming that HSCT patients can elicit potent antibody 
responses. However, an unrelated donor, absolute lymphocyte counts below the 
normal range, and treatment with calcineurin inhibitors lowered the odds of 
responding.
CONCLUSIONS: HSCT patients show a highly heterogeneous vaccine response but, 
overall, patients benefited from the booster shot and can acquire seroprotective 
antibodies over the years after transplantation. Several common patient factors 
lower the odds of responding, urging identification of additional preventive 
strategies in the poorly responding groups.
