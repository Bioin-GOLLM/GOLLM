AIM: To determine whether gene polymorphisms of the major genetic risk loci for 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD): ARMS2 (rs10490923), the complement 
factor H (CFH) (rs1410996) and HTRA1 (rs11200638) influence the response to a 
treatment regimen with ranibizumab for exudative AMD.
METHODS: This study included 100 patients (100 eyes) with exudative AMD. 
Patients underwent a treatment with ranibizumab injections monthly during three 
months. Reinjections were made when the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 
decrease five letters (ETDRS) or central subfield retinal thickness gained 100 
Âµm in optical coherence tomography image. Genotypes (rs10490923, rs1410996 and 
rs11200638) were analyzed using TaqMan probes or polymerase chain 
reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphisms analysis.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in allelic 
distribution of CFH (rs1410996), ARMS2 (rs10490923) and HTRA1 (rs11200638) 
polymorphisms regarding to response to ranibizumab treatment.
CONCLUSION: Ranibizumab treatment response is not related to CFH (rs1410996), 
ARMS2 (rs10490923) and HTRA1 (rs11200638) poymorphisms.
