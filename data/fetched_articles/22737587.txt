Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a complex, chronic, progressive, and debilitating 
neurodegenerative disorder. Neither a cure nor effective long-term therapy exist 
and the lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms responsible for PD 
development is a major impediment to therapeutic advances. The protein 
αSynuclein is a central component in PD pathogenesis yet its cellular targets 
and mechanism of toxicity remains unknown. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also a 
common theme in PD patients and this review explores the strong possibility that 
αSynuclein and mitochondrial dysfunction have an inter-relationship responsible 
for underlying the disease pathology. Amplifying cycles of mitochondrial 
dysfunction and αSynuclein toxicity can be envisaged, with either being the 
disease-initiating factor yet acting together during disease progression. 
Multiple potential mechanisms exist in which mitochondrial dysfunction and 
αSynuclein could interact to exacerbate their neurodegenerative properties. 
Candidates discussed within this review include autophagy, mitophagy, 
mitochondrial dynamics/fusion/fission, oxidative stress and reactive oxygen 
species, endoplasmic reticulum stress, calcium, nitrosative stress and 
αSynuclein Oligomerization.
