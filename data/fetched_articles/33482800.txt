BACKGROUND: The sentence of "Danshen (Salvia Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma) and 
Siwu decoction are similar in function" was first recorded in an ancient Chinese 
medical book "Fu Ren Ming Li Lun". This theory has far-reaching influence on the 
clinical practice of Chinese medicine and is highly respected by Chinese medical 
doctors. However, the theory has limitations and controversial part for there is 
no in-depth and system comparative study.
METHODS: We collected the molecular structures of 129 compounds of Danshen and 
81 compounds of Siwu decoction from the literatures. MACCS fingerprints and 
Tanimoto similarity were calculated based on the molecular structures for 
comparing the structural feature. Molecular descriptors which represent physical 
and chemical properties were calculated by Discovery Studio. Principal component 
analysis (PCA) of was performed based on the descriptors. The ADMET properties 
were predicted by FAF-Drugs4. The effect targets for the compounds with good 
ADMET properties were confirmed from experimental data and predicted using the 
algorithm comprising Bernoulli Naive Bayes profiling.
RESULTS: Based on the molecular structures, the presented study compared the 
structural feature, physical and chemical properties, ADMET properties, and 
effect targets of compounds of Danshen and Siwu decoction. It is found that 
Danshen and Siwu decoction do not have the same main active components. 
Moreover, the 2D structure of compounds from Danshen and Siwu decoction is not 
similar. Some of the compounds of Danshen and Siwu decoction are similar in 3D 
structure. The compounds with good ADMET properties of Danshen and Siwu 
decoction have same predicted targets, but some have different targets.
CONCLUSIONS: It can be inferred from the result that Danshen and Siwu decoction 
have some similarities, but also present differences from each other in the 
structure of the compounds and predicted targets. This may be the material basis 
of the similar and different traditional efficacy of Danshen and Siwu decoction. 
The setence of " Danshen and Siwu decoction are similar in function. " which is 
used in clinical has its material basis and target connotation to some extent. 
However, the traditional effects of Danshen and Siwu decoction are not exactly 
the same.
