We found that a lectin, Datura stramonium agglutinin, induced irreversible 
differentiation in C6 glioma cells. The differentiated cells had long processes, 
a low rate of proliferation and a high content of glial fibrillary acidic 
protein. When the medium was replaced with Datura stramonium agglutinin-free 
medium after 1 h, cell proliferation continued to be inhibited. Experiments with 
several other lectins indicated that both recognition of linear 
N-acetyllactosamine repeats and recognition of multiantennary units of 
cell-surface glycans were required for the inhibition of C6 proliferation. 
Proliferation of four human glial tumour cells was also inhibited by Datura 
stramonium agglutinin. Further, these differentiated human glial tumour cells 
had long processes and a high content of glial fibrillary acidic protein similar 
to differentiated C6 glioma cells. Taken together, these observations suggest 
that Datura stramonium agglutinin may be useful as a new therapy for treating 
glioma without side effects.
