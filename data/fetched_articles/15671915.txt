OBJECTIVES: CD36 is a multifunctional membrane receptor widely expressed in 
different tissues which binds and internalizes oxidized low-density lipoprotein. 
In rodents, CD36 gene variations modulate glucose homeostasis and contribute to 
metabolic syndrome associated with type 2 diabetes but the effects in human are 
unknown.
METHODS: We screened the entire coding sequence of the CD36 gene in 272 
individuals and we genotyped both rare and frequent variants in 454 T2D subjects 
and 221 controls.
RESULTS: We detected five mutations, P191P and N247S were only found each in one 
family and did not segregate with diabetes, the three others (A/C-178 in the 
promoter, A/G-10 in intron 3 and (GGGTTGAGA) insertion in intron 13) being 
equally frequent in diabetic subjects and in controls. However, adiponectin 
levels, a marker for insulin sensitivity, were significantly associated with the 
-178 A/C promoter variant allele (p=0.003, p corrected for multiple 
testing=0.036), possibly reflecting association with insulin-resistance in the 
French population.
CONCLUSION: Thus, the -178 A/C SNP promoter mutation in the CD36 gene represents 
a putative genetic marker for insulin-resistance in the French population, 
although it does not appear to contribute to the genetic risk for T2D.
