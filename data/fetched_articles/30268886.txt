The term ferroptosis was coined in 2012 to describe an iron-dependent regulated 
form of cell death caused by the accumulation of lipid-based reactive oxygen 
species; this type of cell death was found to have molecular characteristics 
distinct from other forms of regulated cell death. Features of ferroptosis have 
been observed periodically over the last several decades, but these molecular 
features were not recognized as evidence of a distinct form of cell death until 
recently. Here, we describe the history of observations consistent with the 
current definition of ferroptosis, as well as the advances that contributed to 
the emergence of the concept of ferroptosis. We also discuss recent implications 
and applications of manipulations of the ferroptotic death pathway.
