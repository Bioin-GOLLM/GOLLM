The dynamic development of nanotechnology has enabled the development of 
innovative and novel techniques for the production and use of nanomaterials. One 
of them is the use of nanocapsules based on biodegradable biopolymer composites. 
Closing compounds with antimicrobial activity inside the nanocapsule cause the 
gradual release of biologically active substances into the environment, and the 
effect on pathogens is regular, prolonged and targeted. Known and used in 
medicine for years, propolis, thanks to the synergistic effect of active 
ingredients, has antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. 
Biodegradable and flexible biofilms were obtained, the morphology of the 
composite was determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and particle 
size was measured by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method. Antimicrobial 
properties of biofoils were examined on commensal skin bacteria and pathogenic 
Candida isolates based on the growth inhibition zones. The research confirmed 
the presence of spherical nanocapsules with sizes in the nano/micrometric scale. 
The properties of the composites were characterized by infrared (IR) and 
ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy. It has been proven that hyaluronic acid is a 
suitable matrix for the preparation of nanocapsules, as no significant 
interactions between hyaluronan and the tested compounds have been demonstrated. 
Color analysis and thermal properties, as well as the thickness and mechanical 
properties of the obtained films, were determined. Antimicrobial properties of 
the obtained nanocomposites were strong in relation to all analyzed bacterial 
and yeast strains isolated from various regions of the human body. These results 
suggest high potential applicability of the tested biofilms as effective 
materials for dressings to be applied on infected wounds.
