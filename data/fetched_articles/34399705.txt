BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related 
deaths worldwide. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification 
occurs in approximately 13-23% of all GC cases and patients with HER2 
overexpression exhibit a poor prognosis. Lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2 tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor, is an effective agent to treat HER2-amplified breast cancer 
but it failed in gastric cancer (GC) clinical trials. However, the molecular 
mechanism of lapatinib resistance in HER2-amplified GC is not well studied.
METHODS: We employed an unbiased, genome-scale screening with pooled CRISPR 
library on HER2-amplified GC cell lines to identify genes that are associated 
with resistance to lapatinib. To validate the candidate genes, we applied in 
vitro and in vivo pharmacological tests to confirm the function of the target 
genes.
RESULTS: We found that loss of function of CSK or PTEN conferred lapatinib 
resistance in HER2-amplified GC cell lines NCI-N87 and OE19, respectively. 
Moreover, PI3K and MAPK signaling was significantly increased in CSK or PTEN 
null cells. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo pharmacological study has shown 
that lapatinib resistance by the loss of function of CSK or PTEN, could be 
overcome by lapatinib combined with the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib and MEK 
inhibitor trametinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that loss-of-function mutations of CSK and PTEN 
cause lapatinib resistance by re-activating MAPK and PI3K pathways, and further 
proved these two pathways are druggable targets. Inhibiting the two pathways 
synergistically are effective to overcome lapatinib resistance in HER2-amplified 
GC. This study provides insights for understanding the resistant mechanism of 
HER2 targeted therapy and novel strategies that may ultimately overcome 
resistance or limited efficacy of lapatinib treatment for subset of HER2 
amplified GC.
