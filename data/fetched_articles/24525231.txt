We report that two oncogenes coamplified on chromosome 3q26, PRKCI and SOX2, 
cooperate to drive a stem-like phenotype in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). 
Protein kinase Cι (PKCι) phosphorylates SOX2, a master transcriptional regulator 
of stemness, and recruits it to the promoter of Hedgehog (Hh) acyltransferase 
(HHAT) that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in Hh ligand production. 
PKCι-mediated SOX2 phosphorylation is required for HHAT promoter occupancy, HHAT 
expression, and maintenance of a stem-like phenotype. Primary LSCC tumors 
coordinately overexpress PKCι, SOX2, and HHAT and require PKCι-SOX2-HHAT 
signaling to maintain a stem-like phenotype. Thus, PKCι and SOX2 are 
genetically, biochemically, and functionally linked in LSCC, and together they 
drive tumorigenesis by establishing a cell-autonomous Hh signaling axis.
