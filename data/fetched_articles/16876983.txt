Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a genetically determined common subtype of 
idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Recently, linkage of JME to the chromosomal 
region 15q14, as well as an allelic and genotypic association between the 
synonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphism c.588C>T (dbSNP: rs3743123, 
S196S) of the positional candidate gene connexin-36 (CX36) and JME have been 
reported. The present replication study examined this tentative association in 
247 German JME patients and 621 population controls. The frequency of the c.588T 
allele was significantly increased in the JME patients (35%) compared to 
controls (29.7%; P=0.016, one-tailed). Consistent to the original report, we 
also observed a significant increase of T/T homozygotes (13.4%) in the JME 
patients compared to controls (8.7%; P=0.019, one-tailed; OR(T/T+)=1.62; 95%-CI: 
1.02-2.57). The present results provide confirmatory evidence for an allelic and 
genotypic association of the CX36 gene with JME.
