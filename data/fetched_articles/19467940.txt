BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal recessive disorder among 
Caucasians. Over 1500 mutations have been identified in cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator disease-gene so far. A large variability of 
the clinical phenotype has been observed both in cystic fibrosis patients 
bearing the same genotype, and in affected sibpairs. Thus, genes inherited 
independently from cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator could 
modulate the clinical expression of cystic fibrosis.
METHODS: We analysed some putative modifier genes of liver cystic fibrosis 
phenotype (serpin 1, hemochromatosis, transferrin receptor 2, ferroportin 1, 
mannose binding lectin and adenosine triphospate-binding cassette subfamily B 
member 4) in 108 unrelated cystic fibrosis patients with and without liver 
involvement.
RESULTS: HYPD mannose binding lectin haplotype was significantly (p<0.05) more 
frequent in cystic fibrosis patients with liver disease versus those without 
liver disease. This haplotype already related to a more severe pulmonary cystic 
fibrosis phenotype, is associated to a reduced MBL immunological activity. The 
c.834-66G>T variant of adenosine triphospate-binding cassette subfamily B member 
4 gene was significantly (p<0.05) less frequent in cystic fibrosis patients with 
liver disease as compared to those with no liver disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The HYPD mannose binding lectin haplotype may predispose a subgroup 
of cystic fibrosis patients to a more severe liver involvement impairing the 
local defence mechanisms whereas the c.834-66G>T adenosine triphospate-binding 
cassette subfamily B member 4 variant may enhance the activity of the protein 
and thus exert a protective effect toward liver disease.
