Induction of programmed DNA damage and its recognition and repair are 
fundamental for B cell development. The ssDNA-binding protein SSB1 has been 
described in human cells as essential for the recognition and repair of DNA 
damage. To study its relevance for B cells, we recently developed Ssb1 -/- and 
conditional Ssb1 -/- mice. Although SSB1 loss did not affect B cell development, 
Ssb1 -/- cells exhibited compensatory expression of its homolog SSB2. We have 
now generated Ssb2 -/- mice and show in this study that SSB2 is also dispensable 
for B cell development and DNA damage response activation. In contrast to the 
single loss of Ssb1 or Ssb2, however, combined SSB1/2 deficiency caused a defect 
in early B cell development. We relate this to the sensitivity of B cell 
precursors as mature B cells largely tolerated their loss. Toxicity of combined 
genetic SSB1/2 loss can be rescued by ectopic expression of either SSB1 or SSB2, 
mimicked by expression of SSB1 ssDNA-binding mutants, and attenuated by 
BCL2-mediated suppression of apoptosis. SSB1/2 loss in B cell precursors further 
caused increased exposure of ssDNA associated with disruption of genome fragile 
sites, inefficient cell cycle progression, and increased DNA damage if apoptosis 
is suppressed. As such, our results establish SSB1/2 as safeguards of B cell 
development and unveil their differential requirement in immature and mature B 
lymphocytes.
