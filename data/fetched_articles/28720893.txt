Considerable evidence shows critical roles of intracellular pathogenic events of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, intracellular amyloid-Î² accumulation 
and oligomerization are early AD pathologic processes, which may lead to changes 
in inflammatory molecules and other AD-related pathological components. Curcumin 
and its analogs have been identified as potential drug candidates for AD. 
However, the effects of curcumin on intracellular AD pathologic processes remain 
largely unknown. Here we utilized a recently developed nanoplasmonic fiber tip 
probe (nFTP) technology and investigated whether curcumin leads to intracellular 
AD pathologic changes. We showed that our nFTP technology could robustly detect 
intracellular AD-related protein changes caused by a well-known inflammation 
inducer and a familial AD mutation. Intriguingly, curcumin remarkably reduced 
the level of intracellular oligomers while modestly reduced the level of an 
inflammatory cytokine. Thus, our results provided evidence that curcumin's 
mechanism of action in attenuating AD pathology is through a major role of 
decreasing oligomerization.
