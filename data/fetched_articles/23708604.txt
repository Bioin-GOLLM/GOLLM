Homeostatic mechanisms regulate the abundance of several components in small-RNA 
pathways. We used Drosophila and mammalian systems to demonstrate a conserved 
homeostatic system in which the status of miRNA biogenesis controls Argonaute 
protein stability. Clonal analyses of multiple mutants of core Drosophila miRNA 
factors revealed that stability of the miRNA effector AGO1 is dependent on miRNA 
biogenesis. Reciprocally, ectopic transcription of miRNAs within in vivo clones 
induced accumulation of AGO1, as did genetic interference with the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system. In mouse cells, we found that the stability of Ago2 
declined in Dicer-knockout cells and was rescued by proteasome blockade or 
introduction of either Dicer plasmid or Dicer-independent miRNA constructs. 
Notably, Dicer-dependent miRNA constructs generated pre-miRNAs that bound Ago2 
but did not rescue Ago2 stability. We conclude that Argonaute levels are finely 
tuned by cellular availability of mature miRNAs and the ubiquitin-proteasome 
system.
