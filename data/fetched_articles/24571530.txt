BACKGROUND: A rare neuro-ichthyotic disorder characterized by ichthyosis, 
spastic quadriplegia and intellectual disability and caused by recessive 
mutations in ELOVL4, encoding elongase-4 protein has recently been described. 
The objective of the study was to search for sequence variants in the gene 
ELOVL4 in three affected individuals of a consanguineous Pakistani family 
exhibiting features of neuro-ichthyotic disorder.
METHODS: Linkage in the family was searched by genotyping microsatellite markers 
linked to the gene ELOVL4, mapped at chromosome 6p14.1. Exons and splice 
junction sites of the gene ELOVL4 were polymerase chain reaction amplified and 
sequenced in an automated DNA sequencer.
RESULTS: DNA sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation 
(c.78C > G; p.Tyr26*).
CONCLUSIONS: Our report further confirms the recently described ELOVL4-related 
neuro-ichthyosis and shows that the neurological phenotype can be absent in some 
individuals.
