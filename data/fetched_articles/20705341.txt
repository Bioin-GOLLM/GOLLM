PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of the 
adrenergic receptor (ADR) and diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) in Japanese 
normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) patients.
DESIGN: Prospective, comparative case series.
PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-two untreated NTG patients.
METHODS: The IOP of both eyes was measured at 3-hour intervals from 0600 to 2400 
hours over 2 consecutive days. We used IOP data from the eye with the greater 
visual field defect for statistical analysis. The mean IOP over 2 days was used 
for each time point. Genetic polymorphisms in α1A-, α2A-, α2B-, α2C-, β1-, β2-, 
and β3-ADR were determined mainly by direct DNA sequencing. The relationship 
between IOP and genetic polymorphisms was analyzed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The IOP and genotypes of genetic polymorphisms.
RESULTS: Diurnal mean IOP of the subjects was 14.8 ± 2.1 mmHg (mean value ± 
standard deviation). For Del 301-303 in α2B-ADR, insertion/insertion (I/I) had a 
significantly higher diurnal mean IOP (P = 0.017), peak IOP (P = 0.038), and 
trough IOP (P = 0.046) than deletion (D) carriers. For Del 322-325 in α2C-ADR, 
I/I had a significantly lower diurnal mean IOP (P = 0.037) and peak IOP (P = 
0.029) than D carriers. For S49G (A/G) in β1-ADR, A/A had a significantly higher 
diurnal mean IOP (P = 0.023), peak IOP (P = 0.019), and trough IOP (P = 0.014) 
than G carriers. For these 3 polymorphisms, repeated measures analysis of 
variance showed that the major homozygotes and minor carriers had parallel 
diurnal IOP curves, but significantly different diurnal IOP levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms of the ADR gene may alter the untreated IOP level of 
patients with NTG.
