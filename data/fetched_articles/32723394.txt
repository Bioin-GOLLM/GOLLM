BACKGROUND: Between 30 and 50% of colon tumors have mutations in the Kirsten-ras 
(KRAS) gene, which have a large nutritional attributable risk. Despite its high 
frequency in colorectal cancer (CRC), data to support specific associations 
between KRAS mutations in CRC and diet are sparse. Here, we conducted a 
systematic review to summarize the current epidemiological evidence on the 
association between various dietary factors and KRAS mutations.
METHODS: PubMed, Science Direct, and Cochrane databases were searched for 
relevant studies published until December 31, 2019, using inclusion and 
exclusion criteria in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We analyzed the studies 
to find associations between nutritional factors and CRC tumors with KRAS 
mutations in humans.
RESULTS: We identified 28 relevant studies to include in this systematic review. 
In-depth analyses showed unclear associations between nutritional factors and 
KRAS mutations in CRC. Most epidemiological studies in the same nutrient or food 
often reported conflicting and/or inconclusive findings, whereas for some 
dietary factors, the results were homogeneous.
CONCLUSIONS: Further research using a more robust prospective cohort study is 
needed to lend more credence to the epidemiological associations found between 
KRAS mutations and dietary factors.
