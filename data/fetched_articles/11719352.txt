Functional consequences of 12 mutations-10 missense, 1 splicing defect, and 1 
frameshift mutation-were characterized in the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase 
(URO-D) gene found in Utah pedigrees with familial porphyria cutanea tarda 
(F-PCT). All but one mutation altered a restriction site in the URO-D gene, 
permitting identification of affected relatives using a combination of 
polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion. In a bacterial 
expression system, 3 of the missense mutants were found in inclusion bodies, but 
7 were expressed as soluble proteins. Enzymatic activity of soluble, recombinant 
mutant URO-D genes ranged from 29% to 94% of normal. URO-D mRNA levels in 
Epstein-Barr-virus transformed cells derived from patients were normal (with the 
exception of the frameshift mutation) even though protein levels were lower than 
normal, suggesting that missense mutations generally cause unstable URO-Ds in 
vivo. The crystal structures of 3 mutant URO-Ds were solved, and the structural 
consequences of the mutations were defined. All missense mutations reported here 
and by others were mapped to the crystal structure of URO-D, and structural 
effects were predicted. These studies define structural and functional 
consequences of URO-D mutations occurring in patients with F-PCT.
