OBJECTIVE: Previous studies on patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) 
yielded inconclusive results in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based 
analyses of alterations of subcortical structures in the brain. The aim of this 
study was to compare volumes as well as shapes of subcortical structures and the 
hippocampus between RLS cases and controls. Additionally, the associations 
between the genetic risks for RLS and subcortical volumes were investigated.
METHODS: We compared volumetric as well as shape differences assessed by 3 T MRI 
in the caudate nucleus, hippocampus, globus pallidus, putamen, and thalamus in 
39 RLS cases versus 117 controls, nested within a population-based sample. In a 
subsample, we explored associations between known genetic risk markers for RLS 
and the volumes of the subcortical structures and the hippocampus.
RESULTS: No significant differences between RLS cases and controls in 
subcortical and hippocampal shapes and volumes were observed. Furthermore, the 
genetic risk for RLS was unrelated to any alterations of subcortical and 
hippocampal gray matter volume.
INTERPRETATION: We conclude that neither RLS nor the genetic risk for the 
disease give rise to changes in hippocampal and subcortical shapes and gray 
matter volumes.
