Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3) and neurexins (NRXNs) constitute a canonical transsynaptic 
cell-adhesion pair, which has been implicated in autism. In autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) development of sociality can be impaired. However, the molecular 
mechanism underlying NLGN3-mediated social development is unclear. Here, we 
identify non-canonical interactions between NLGN3 and protein tyrosine 
phosphatase δ (PTPδ) splice variants, competing with NRXN binding. NLGN3-PTPδ 
complex structure revealed a splicing-dependent interaction mode and competition 
mechanism between PTPδ and NRXNs. Mice carrying a NLGN3 mutation that 
selectively impairs NLGN3-NRXN interaction show increased sociability, whereas 
mice where the NLGN3-PTPδ interaction is impaired exhibit impaired social 
behavior and enhanced motor learning, with imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory 
synaptic protein expressions, as reported in the Nlgn3 R451C autism model. At 
neuronal level, the autism-related Nlgn3 R451C mutation causes selective 
impairment in the non-canonical pathway. Our findings suggest that canonical and 
non-canonical NLGN3 pathways compete and regulate the development of sociality.
