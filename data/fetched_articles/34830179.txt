In prostate cancer (PC), the PD-1/PD-L1 axis regulates various signaling 
pathways and it is influenced by extracellular factors. Pre-clinical 
experimental studies investigating the effects of various treatments (alone or 
combined) may discover how to overcome the immunotherapy-resistance in 
PC-patients. We performed a systematic literature review (PRISMA guidelines) to 
delineate the landscape of pre-clinical studies (including cell lines and mouse 
models) that tested treatments with effects on PD-L1 signaling in PC. NF-kB, 
MEK, JAK, or STAT inhibitors on human/mouse, primary/metastatic PC-cell lines 
variably down-modulated PD-L1-expression, reducing chemoresistance and tumor 
cell migration. If PC-cells were co-cultured with NK, CD8+ T-cells or CAR-T 
cells, the immune cell cytotoxicity increased when PD-L1 was downregulated 
(opposite effects for PD-L1 upregulation). In mouse models, radiotherapy, 
CDK4/6-inhibitors, and RB deletion induced PD-L1-upregulation, causing 
PC-immune-evasion. Epigenetic drugs may reduce PD-L1 expression. In some PC 
experimental models, blocking only the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway had limited efficacy 
in reducing the tumor growth. Anti-tumor effects could be increased by combining 
the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with other approaches (inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, 
PI3K/mTOR or JAK/STAT3 pathways, p300/CBP; anti-RANKL and/or anti-CTLA-4 
antibodies; cytokines; nitroxoline; DNA/cell vaccines; radiotherapy/Radium-223).
