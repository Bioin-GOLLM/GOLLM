Monoclonal antibodies (Abs) that recognize major histocompatability complex 
(MHC)-presented tumor antigens in a manner similar to T cell receptors (TCRs) 
have great potential as cancer immunotherapeutics. However, isolation of 
'TCR-mimic' (TCRm) Abs is laborious because Abs have not evolved the 
structurally nuanced peptide-MHC restriction of αβ-TCRs. Here, we present a 
strategy for rapid isolation of highly peptide-specific and 'MHC-restricted' Abs 
by re-engineering preselected Abs that engage peptide-MHC in a manner 
structurally similar to that of conventional αβ-TCRs. We created structure-based 
libraries focused on the peptide-interacting residues of TCRm Ab 
complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops, and rapidly generated 
MHC-restricted Abs to both mouse and human tumor antigens that specifically 
killed target cells when formatted as IgG, bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) and 
chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T). Crystallographic analysis of one selected 
pMHC-restricted Ab revealed highly peptide-specific recognition, validating the 
engineering strategy. This approach can yield tumor antigen-specific antibodies 
in several weeks, potentially enabling rapid clinical translation.
