Stellera chamaejasme L. (Thymelaeaceae) is a perennial herb that is widely used 
in traditional Chinese medicine to treat tumours, tuberculosis and psoriasis. S. 
chamaejasme extract (SCE) possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and wound 
healing activities; however, the effect of S. chamaejasme and its active 
compounds on cutaneous wound healing has not been investigated. We assessed 
full-thickness wounds of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and topically applied SCE for 
2 weeks. In vitro studies were performed using HaCaT keratinocytes, Hs68 dermal 
fibroblasts and RAW 264.7 macrophages to determine cell viability (MTT assay), 
cell migration, collagen expression, nitric oxide (NO) production, prostaglandin 
E2 (PGE2) production, inflammatory cytokine expression and β-catenin activation. 
In vivo, wound size was reduced and epithelisation was improved in SCE-treated 
SD rats. In vitro, SCE and its active compounds induced keratinocyte migration 
by regulating the β-catenin, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt 
signalling pathways. Furthermore, SCE and its active compounds increased mRNA 
expression of type I and III collagen in Hs68 fibroblasts. SCE and chamechromone 
inhibited NO and PGE2 release and mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators in 
RAW 264.7 macrophages. SCE enhances the motility of HaCaT keratinocytes and 
improves cutaneous wound healing in SD rats.
