OBJECTIVE: SCN1A, encoding the alpha 1 subunit of the sodium channel, is 
associated with a range of related epilepsy. This study aims to assess saliva 
and urine pH in children with SCN1A-related epilepsy.
METHODS: A prospective controlled observational study with a 1:1 ratio was 
conducted on seven patients with SCN1A-related epilepsy and seven healthy 
children of the same family, gender, and age but without a history of seizures. 
The pH of saliva and urine was measured by pH test paper. Parents of patients 
with epilepsy recorded seizures to compare the relationship between pH and 
seizures.
RESULTS: The fourteen participants were all males, aged 1 to 14 years. Seven 
patients had different pathogenic SCN1A variants. The pH of saliva and urine was 
monitored for 21-95 days. The pH of saliva and urine was higher in patients with 
SCN1A-related epilepsy than in the healthy group. The urine pH in Dravet 
syndrome patients was high compared with other epilepsy patients. The urine pH 
in patients with seizures was higher than that in patients without seizures, 
which occurred during the study.
CONCLUSIONS: The pH of saliva and urine was chronically high in patients with 
SCN1A-related epilepsy, and urine pH was higher in patients with seizures and 
with Dravet syndrome.
