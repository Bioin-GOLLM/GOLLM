The Mediator complex subunit 13-like (MED13L) protein is part of the 
multi-protein mediator complex and plays an important role in gene 
transcription. Polymorphisms in the MED13L gene have been linked to congenital 
heart anomalies and intellectual disabilities. Despite recent evidence of 
indirect links of MED13L to cytokine release and inflammation, impact of genetic 
variations in MED13L on immune cells remains unexplored. The B10.RIII and 
RIIIS/J mouse strains vary in susceptibility to induced experimental autoimmune 
disease models. From sequencing data of the two mouse strains, we identified six 
polymorphisms in the coding regions of Med13L. Using congenic mice, we studied 
the effect of these polymorphisms on immune cell development and function along 
with susceptibility to collagen-induced arthritis, an animal model for 
rheumatoid arthritis. Combining in vivo disease data, in vitro functional data, 
and computational analysis of the reported non-synonymous polymorphisms, we 
report that genetic polymorphisms in Med13L do not affect the immune phenotype 
in these mice and are predicted to be non-disease associated.
