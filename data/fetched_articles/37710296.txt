Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (IGS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by vitamin B12 malabsorption. Most patients present with 
non-specific symptoms attributed to vitamin B12 deficiency, and proteinuria. 
Patients may if untreated, develop severe neurocognitive manifestations. If 
recognized and treated with sufficient doses of vitamin B12, patients recover 
completely. We provide, for the first time, an overview of all previously 
reported cases of IGS. In addition, we provide a complete review of IGS and 
describe two new patients.
