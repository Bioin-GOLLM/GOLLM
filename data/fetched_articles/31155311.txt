The human antiviral protein MxB is a restriction factor that fights HIV 
infection. Previous experiments have demonstrated that MxB targets the HIV 
capsid, a protein shell that protects the viral genome. To make the 
conical-shaped capsid, HIV CA proteins are organized into a lattice composed of 
hexamer and pentamer building blocks, providing many interfaces for host 
proteins to recognize. Through extensive biochemical and biophysical studies and 
molecular dynamics simulations, we show that MxB is targeting the HIV capsid by 
recognizing the region created at the intersection of three CA hexamers. We are 
further able to map this interaction to a few CA residues, located in a 
negatively charged well at the interface between the three CA hexamers. This 
work provides detailed residue-level mapping of the targeted capsid interface 
and how MxB interacts. This information could inspire the development of 
capsid-targeting therapies for HIV.
