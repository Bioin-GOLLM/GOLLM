Plants use sugars as signaling molecules and possess mechanisms to detect and 
respond to changes in sugar availability, ranging from the level of secondary 
signaling molecules to altered gene transcription. G-protein-coupled pathways 
are involved in sugar signaling in plants. The Arabidopsis thaliana regulator of 
G-protein signaling protein 1 (AtRGS1) combines a receptor-like seven 
transmembrane domain with an RGS domain, interacts with the Arabidopsis Galpha 
subunit (AtGPA1) in a d-glucose-regulated manner, and stimulates AtGPA1 GTPase 
activity. We determined that AtRGS1 interacts with additional components, 
genetically defined here, to serve as a plasma membrane sensor for d-glucose. 
This interaction between AtRGS1 and AtGPA1 involves, in part, the 
seven-transmembrane domain of AtRGS1.
