Mutations in the Patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) gene lead to an autosomal dominant 
disorder known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) or Gorlin 
syndrome (GS). Several PTCH1 mutations have been observed in NBCCS associated 
with keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs), including non-syndromic KCOTs. The 
missense mutation c.3277G>C (p.G1093R) in exon 19 of the PTCH1 gene has only 
been reported in non-syndromic KCOTs. The present study reports for the first 
time a familial case (father and daughter) of NBCCS and KCOTs, carrying the same 
c.3277G>C (p.G1093R) germline mutation. This observation suggests that this 
missense mutation is involved in the pathogenesis of NBCCS as well as in a 
subset of non-syndromic KCOTs. The identification of a missense mutation may 
lead to an earlier diagnosis of NBCCS.
