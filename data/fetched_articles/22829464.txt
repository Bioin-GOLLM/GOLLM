In the longitudinal study reported here, we examined genetic and 
caregiving-based contributions to individual differences in infant attachment 
classifications. For 154 mother-infant pairs, we rated mothers' responsiveness 
to their 6-month-old infants during naturalistic interactions and classified 
infants' attachment organization at 12 and 18 months using the Strange Situation 
procedure. These infants were later genotyped with respect to the 
serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). Maternal 
responsiveness uniquely predicted infants' attachment security. Infants' 
5-HTTLPR variation uniquely predicted their subtype of attachment security at 12 
months and their subtype of attachment insecurity at 12 and 18 months. The short 
allele for 5-HTTLPR was associated with attachment classifications characterized 
by higher emotional distress. These findings suggest that 5-HTTLPR variation 
contributes to infants' emotional reactivity and that the degree to which 
caregivers are responsive influences how effectively infants use their 
caregivers for emotion regulation. Theoretical implications for the study of 
genetic and caregiving influences are discussed.
