The MITF-E318K variant has been implicated in genetic predisposition to 
cutaneous melanoma. We addressed the occurrence of MITF-E318K and its 
association with germline status of CDKN2A and MC1R genes in a hospital-based 
series of 248 melanoma patients including cohorts of multiple, familial, 
pediatric, sporadic and melanoma associated with other tumors. Seven MITF-E318K 
carriers were identified, spanning every group except the pediatric patients. 
Three carriers showed mutated CDKN2A, five displayed MC1R variants, while the 
sporadic carrier revealed no variants. Germline/tumor whole exome sequencing for 
this carrier revealed germline variants of unknown significance in ATM and FANCI 
genes and, in four BRAF-V600E metastases, somatic loss of the MITF wild-type 
allele, amplification of MITF-E318K and deletion of a 9p21.3 chromosomal region 
including CDKN2A and MTAP. In silico analysis of tumors from MITF-E318K melanoma 
carriers in the TCGA Pan-Cancer-Atlas dataset confirmed the association with 
BRAF mutation and 9p21.3 deletion revealing a common genetic pattern. MTAP was 
the gene deleted at homozygous level in the highest number of patients. These 
results support the utility of both germline and tumor genome analysis to define 
tumor groups providing enhanced information for clinical strategies and 
highlight the importance of melanoma prevention programs for MITF-E318K 
patients.
