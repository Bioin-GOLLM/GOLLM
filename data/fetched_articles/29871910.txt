Epithelial cell polarity is linked to the control of tissue growth and 
tumorigenesis. The tumor suppressor and cell polarity protein lethal-2-giant 
larvae (Lgl) promotes Hippo signaling and inhibits Notch signaling to restrict 
tissue growth in Drosophila melanogaster Notch signaling is greater in lgl 
mutant tissue than in wild-type tissue because of increased acidification of 
endosomal vesicles, which promotes the proteolytic processing and activation of 
Notch by γ-secretase. We showed that the increased Notch signaling and tissue 
growth defects of lgl mutant tissue depended on endosomal vesicle acidification 
mediated by the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase). Lgl promoted the 
activity of the V-ATPase by interacting with Vap33 (VAMP-associated protein of 
33 kDa). Vap33 physically and genetically interacted with Lgl and V-ATPase 
subunits and repressed V-ATPase-mediated endosomal vesicle acidification and 
Notch signaling. Vap33 overexpression reduced the abundance of the V-ATPase 
component Vha44, whereas Lgl knockdown reduced the binding of Vap33 to the 
V-ATPase component Vha68-3. Our data indicate that Lgl promotes the binding of 
Vap33 to the V-ATPase, thus inhibiting V-ATPase-mediated endosomal vesicle 
acidification and thereby reducing γ-secretase activity, Notch signaling, and 
tissue growth. Our findings implicate the deregulation of Vap33 and V-ATPase 
activity in polarity-impaired epithelial cancers.
