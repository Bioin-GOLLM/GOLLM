BACKGROUND: Therapeutic options for ulcerative colitis (UC) have increased since 
the introduction of biologics a few decades ago. Due to the wide range of 
biologics available, physicians have difficulty in selecting biologics and do 
not know how to balance the best drug between clinical efficacy and safety. This 
study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of biologics in treating 
ulcerative colitis.
METHODS: In this study, eight electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, 
Cochrane, Embase, Sinomed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing 
VIP Information, and WanFang Data) were searched to collect eligible studies 
without language restrictions. Retrieved 1 June 2023, from inception. All 
articles included in the mesh analysis are randomised controlled trials (RCTs). 
The inclusion of drugs for each outcome was ranked using a curved surface under 
cumulative ranking (SUCRA). Higher SUCRA scores were associated with better 
outcomes, whereas lower SUCRA scores were associated with better safety. This 
study has registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023389483.
RESULTS: Induction Therapy: Among the biologic therapies evaluated for induction 
therapy, vedolizumab demonstrated the highest efficacy in achieving clinical 
remission (OR vs daclizumab, 9.09; 95% CI, 1.01-81.61; SUCRA 94.1) and clinical 
response. Guselkumab showed the lowest risk of recurrence of UC (SUCRA 94.9%), 
adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation (SUCRA 94.8%), and serious 
infections (SUCRA 78.0%). Maintenance Therapy: For maintenance therapy, 
vedolizumab ranked highest in maintaining clinical remission (OR vs mesalazine 
4.36; 95% CI, 1.65-11.49; SUCRA 89.7) and endoscopic improvement (SUCRA 92.6). 
Infliximab demonstrated the highest efficacy in endoscopic improvement (SUCRA 
92.6%). Ustekinumab had the lowest risk of infections (SUCRA 92.9%), serious 
adverse events (SUCRA 91.3%), and serious infections (SUCRA 67.6%).
CONCLUSION: Our network meta-analysis suggests that vedolizumab is the most 
effective biologic therapy for inducing and maintaining clinical remission in UC 
patients. Guselkumab shows promise in reducing the risk of recurrence and 
adverse events during induction therapy. Infliximab is effective in improving 
endoscopic outcomes during maintenance therapy. Ustekinumab appears to have a 
favorable safety profile. These findings provide valuable insights for 
clinicians in selecting the most appropriate biologic therapy for UC patients.
