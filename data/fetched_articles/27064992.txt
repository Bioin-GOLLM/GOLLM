BACKGROUND: The BRAF V600E and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter 
mutations have been reported in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The aim of 
this retrospective cross-sectional study was to add further information 
regarding the prevalence of the BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations in 
Chinese PTC and their clinicopathological associations.
METHODS: We detected the BRAF V600E mutation and TERT promoter mutations in 455 
Chinese PTC patients and analyzed the association of these mutations with 
several clinicopathological features.
RESULTS: The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 343 (75.4%) of 455 cases and 
was significantly associated with older age (p<0.001) and conventional subtype 
(p = 0.003). TERT promoter mutations were detected in 19 (4.4%) of 434 PTCs and 
were associated with older age (p<0.001), larger tumor size (p = 0.024), and 
advanced TNM stage(p<0.001). Of the 19 patients that were positive for TERT 
promoter mutations, 18 (94.7%) also harbored the BRAF V600E mutation.
CONCLUSION: We determined the prevalence and clinicopathological associations of 
BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations in Chinese PTC patients. TERT promoter 
mutations but not the BRAF V600E mutation were associated with more advanced TNM 
stage upon diagnosis.
