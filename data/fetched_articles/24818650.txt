Transthyretin (TTR) cardiac amyloidosis is characterized by deposition of either 
mutant or wild type TTR amyloid protein in the myocardium ultimately leading to 
progressive cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The most common TTR gene mutation 
that leads to TTR cardiac amyloidosis is the valine-to-isoleucine substitution 
at position 122 (V122I or Ile122). Currently, the only definitive treatment 
suggested for mutant TTR cardiac amyloidosis is the combined or sequential 
liver-heart transplantation in eligible patients, since liver is the source of 
TTR production. Here, we report a case of heterozygous Val122L mutated 
TTR-related cardiac amyloidosis treated with isolated heart transplantation with 
no recurrence of amyloid in the cardiac allograft and no systemic abnormalities 
5 years after heart transplantation. Abbreviations MMF mycophenolate mofetil
