The mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase MITOL regulates mitochondrial dynamics. We 
report here that MITOL regulates mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) membrane (MAM) domain formation through mitofusin2 (Mfn2). MITOL interacts 
with and ubiquitinates mitochondrial Mfn2, but not ER-associated Mfn2. Mutation 
analysis identified a specific interaction between MITOL C-terminal domain and 
Mfn2 HR1 domain. MITOL mediated lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chain addition to 
Mfn2, but not its proteasomal degradation. MITOL knockdown inhibited Mfn2 
complex formation and caused Mfn2 mislocalization and MAM dysfunction. 
Sucrose-density gradient centrifugation and blue native PAGE retardation assay 
demonstrated that MITOL is required for GTP-dependent Mfn2 oligomerization. 
MITOL knockdown reduced Mfn2 GTP binding, resulting in reduced GTP hydrolysis. 
We identified K192 in the GTPase domain of Mfn2 as a major ubiquitination site 
for MITOL. A K192R mutation blocked oligomerization even in the presence of GTP. 
Taken together, these results suggested that MITOL regulates ER tethering to 
mitochondria by activating Mfn2 via K192 ubiquitination.
