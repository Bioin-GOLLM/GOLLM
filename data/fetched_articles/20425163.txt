Marfan syndrome is a systemic connective tissue disorder that is inherited in an 
autosomal-dominant pattern with variable penetrance. Although there are many 
clinical manifestations of this disease, the most life threatening are 
cardiovascular complications, including mitral valve prolapse and aortic root 
aneurysm. When the primary defect was discovered in the fibrillin-1 gene, it was 
hypothesized that mutations in fibrillin-1 resulted in a weakened and disordered 
elastic architecture. However, recent evidence has suggested that the Marfan 
syndrome is caused by more than just a disordered microfibril matrix. Interest 
was stimulated when it was discovered that fibrillin-1 mutations enhanced the 
release of sequestered latent transforming growth factor-beta, a well-described 
mediator of vascular remodeling. This article focuses on the pathophysiology of 
aortopathy in the Marfan syndrome and related diseases, with special emphasis on 
the role of transforming growth factor-beta in mediating the pathogenesis of 
this disease.
