Acute myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium, and it can 
present as severe heart failure in children. Differential diagnosis with genetic 
cardiomyopathy can be difficult. The objective of this study is to identify 
patterns of clinical presentation and to assess invasive and non-invasive 
measures to differentiate patients with acute myocarditis from patients with 
dilated genetic cardiomyopathy. We performed a retrospective descriptive study 
of all paediatric patients (0-16 years old) that presented with new-onset heart 
failure with left ventricle ejection fraction < 35% in whom we performed an 
endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) during the period from April 2007 to December 2020. 
The patients were classified into two groups: Group 1 included 18 patients with 
myocarditis. Group 2 included 9 patients with genetic cardiomyopathy. Findings 
favouring a diagnosis of myocarditis included a fulminant or acute presentation 
(77.8% vs 33.3%, p = 0.01), higher degree of cardiac enzyme elevation 
(p = 0.011), lower left ventricular dimension z-score (2.2 vs 5.4, p = 0.03) 
increase of ventricular wall thickness (88.8% vs 33.3%, p = 0.03) and oedema in 
the EMB. Seven (77.8%) patients with genetic cardiomyopathy had inflammation in 
the endomyocardial biopsy fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of inflammatory 
cardiomyopathy.Conclusion: Differentiating patients with a myocarditis from 
those with genetic cardiomyopathy can be challenging, even performing an EMB. 
Some patients with genetic cardiomyopathy fulfil the diagnostic criteria of 
inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Using invasive and non-invasive measures may be 
useful to develop a predictive model to differentiate myocarditis from genetic 
cardiomyopathy. What is Known: • Acute myocarditis could present with 
cardiogenic shock in paediatric patients. • Parvovirus B19 is the main cause of 
myocarditis in this population. What is New: • Current diagnostic criteria for 
myocarditis have limited use in paediatric patients presenting with new-onset 
heart failure. • Some patients with a genetic cardiomyopathy and a new-onset 
heart failure fulfill the diagnostic criteria of inflammatory cardiomyopathy.
