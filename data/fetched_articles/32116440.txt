BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a disease that affects the body's ability to produce or 
use insulin. A total of 425 million people are suffering from diabetes in the 
world. Of this, more than 16 million people live in the Africa Region, which is 
estimated to be around 41 million by 2045. The main objective of this study was 
to design and develop a prototype knowledge-based system using data mining 
techniques for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes.
METHODS: For this study, experimental research design was employed, and the 
researchers used domain expert knowledge as a supplement of data mining 
techniques whereby three classification algorithms in WEKA; namely J48, PART and 
JRip were used, and finally the researchers decided to use the results of J48 
classification algorithm. Ultimate Visual basic studio 2013 (Vb.net) was used to 
store knowledge and as front side of prototype. Common lisp prolog (Clisp) was 
used for obtained knowledge back end coding.
RESULTS: Using a decision tree algorithm; namely J48, 2512 (95.1515%) of the 
instances were classified correctly, and 128 (4.8485 %) were classified 
incorrectly. The second most performing model was generated by JRip Classier. 
This model scored the 94.7348% accuracy on the general data to classify the 
status of diabetic patient datasets. It classified the 2501 instances of the 
records correctly.
CONCLUSION: The J48 model was the best performing model with the best accuracy 
of results.
