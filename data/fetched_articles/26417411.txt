Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a heterozygous monogenic 
diabetes; more than 13 disease genes have been identified. However, the 
pathogenesis of MODY is not fully understood, because the pancreatic β-cells of 
the patients are inaccessable. Therefore, we attempted to establish MODY 
patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (MODY-iPS) cells to investigate 
the pathogenic mechanism of MODY by inducing pancreatic β-cells. We established 
MODY5-iPS cells from a Japanese patient with MODY5 (R177X), and confirmed that 
MODY5-iPS cells possessed the characteristics of pluripotent stem cells. In the 
course of differentiation from MODY5-iPS cells into pancreatic β-cells, we 
examined the disease gene, HNF1B messenger ribonucleic acid. We found that the 
amount of R177X mutant transcripts was much less than that of wild ones, but 
they increased after adding cycloheximide to the medium. These results suggest 
that these R177X mutant messenger ribonucleic acids are disrupted by 
nonsense-mediated messenger ribonucleic acid decay in MODY-iPS cells during the 
developmental stages of pancreatic β-cells.
