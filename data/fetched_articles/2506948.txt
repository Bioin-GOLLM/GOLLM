We have analyzed the factor VIII (FVIII) protein and the nucleotide sequence 
around two thrombin cleavage sites, at arginine 372 in the FVIII heavy chain and 
arginine 1689 in the FVIII light chain in a naturally occurring dysfunctional 
FVIII variant, FVIII Okayama. The patient was a 42-year-old hemophiliac with a 
FVIII coagulant activity of 0.03 U/mL and a FVIII antigen level of 0.8 U/mL. The 
patient's FVIII was not thrombin activatable to levels seen in normal plasma. 
Immunoblotting of partially purified FVIII Okayama and normal FVIII showed that 
thrombin cleavage of the 92 kilodalton (Kd) heavy chain was impaired in the 
mutant protein. The patient's genomic DNA was amplified using the polymerase 
chain reaction with two sets of synthetic oligonucleotide primers spanning amino 
acid residues 319 to 400 and 1630 to 1720. Sequence analysis of the amplified 
DNA fragments revealed a cytosine to thymine transition, converting an arginine 
to a cysteine codon at residue 372. No abnormality was found in the FVIII light 
chain region analyzed. The patient's hemophilic brother and carrier mother 
revealed the same mutation. We conclude that the pathogenesis of hemophilia A in 
this patient is probably due to an arginine to cysteine substitution at a 
thrombin cleavage site in the FVIII heavy chain.
