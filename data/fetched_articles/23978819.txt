BACKGROUND: Obesity is a public health concern. Yet the identification of 
adiposity-related genetic variants among United States (US) Hispanics, which is 
the largest US minority group, remains largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To interrogate an a priori list of 47 (32 overall body mass and 15 
central adiposity) index single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously 
studied in individuals of European descent among 3494 US Hispanic women in the 
Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource (WHI SHARe).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of measured body mass index (BMI), waist 
circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were inverse normally 
transformed after adjusting for age, smoking, center and global ancestry. WC and 
WHR models were also adjusted for BMI. Genotyping was performed using the 
Affymetrix 6.0 array. In the absence of an a priori selected SNP, a proxy was 
selected (r(2)0.8 in CEU).
RESULTS: Six BMI loci (TMEM18, NUDT3/HMGA1, FAIM2, FTO, MC4R and KCTD15) and two 
WC/WHR loci (VEGFA and ITPR2-SSPN) were nominally significant (P<0.05) at the 
index or proxy SNP in the corresponding BMI and WC/WHR models. To account for 
distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns in Hispanics and further assess 
generalization of genetic effects at each locus, we interrogated the evidence 
for association at the 47 surrounding loci within 1 Mb region of the index or 
proxy SNP. Three additional BMI loci (FANCL, TFAP2B and ETV5) and five WC/WHR 
loci (DNM3-PIGC, GRB14, ADAMTS9, LY86 and MSRA) displayed Bonferroni-corrected 
significant associations with BMI and WC/WHR. Conditional analyses of each index 
SNP (or its proxy) and the most significant SNP within the 1 Mb region supported 
the possible presence of index-independent signals at each of these eight loci 
as well as at KCTD15.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the generalization of nine BMI and 
seven central adiposity loci in Hispanic women. This study expands the current 
knowledge of common adiposity-related genetic loci to Hispanic women.
