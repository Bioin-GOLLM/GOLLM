Alphaviruses are (re-)emerging arboviruses of public health concern. The nsP3 
gene product is one of the key players during viral replication. NsP3 comprises 
three domains: a macro domain, a zinc-binding domain and a hypervariable region. 
The macro domain is essential at both early and late stages of the replication 
cycle through ADP-ribose (ADPr) binding and de-ADP-ribosylation of host 
proteins. However, both its specific role and the precise molecular mechanism of 
de-ADP-ribosylation across specific viral families remains to be elucidated. 
Here we investigate by X-ray crystallography the mechanism of ADPr reactivity in 
the active site of Getah virus macro domain, which displays a peculiar 
substitution of one of the conserved residues in the catalytic loop. ADPr adopts 
distinct poses including a covalent bond between the C''1 of the ADPr and a 
conserved Togaviridae-specific cysteine. These different poses observed for ADPr 
may represent snapshots of the de-ADP-ribosylation mechanism, highlighting 
residues to be further characterised.
