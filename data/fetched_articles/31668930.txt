High-resolution Cas9 structures have yet to reveal catalytic conformations due 
to HNH nuclease domain positioning away from the cleavage site. Nme1Cas9 and 
Nme2Cas9 are compact nucleases for in vivo genome editing. Here, we report 
structures of meningococcal Cas9 homologs in complex with sgRNA, dsDNA, or the 
AcrIIC3 anti-CRISPR protein. DNA-bound structures represent an early step of 
target recognition, a later HNH pre-catalytic state, the HNH catalytic state, 
and a cleaved-target-DNA-bound state. In the HNH catalytic state of Nme1Cas9, 
the active site is seen poised at the scissile phosphodiester linkage of the 
target strand, providing a high-resolution view of the active conformation. The 
HNH active conformation activates the RuvC domain. Our structures explain how 
Nme1Cas9 and Nme2Cas9 read distinct PAM sequences and how AcrIIC3 inhibits 
Nme1Cas9 activity. These structures provide insights into Cas9 domain 
rearrangements, guide-target engagement, cleavage mechanism, and anti-CRISPR 
inhibition, facilitating the optimization of these genome-editing platforms.
