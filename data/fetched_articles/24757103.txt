BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Improved identification of those at risk of stroke might 
improve prevention. We evaluated the association of the cardiac function 
biomarker N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with stroke risk 
in the 30 239 black and white participants of the Reasons for Geographic and 
Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort.
METHODS: During 5.4 years of follow-up after enrollment in 2003 to 2007, 
NT-proBNP was measured in baseline blood samples of 546 subjects with incident 
ischemic stroke and 956 without stroke.
RESULTS: NT-proBNP was higher with older age and in those with heart disease, 
kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and lower low-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol. Adjusting for age, race, sex, income, education, and 
traditional stroke risk factors, there was an increased risk of stroke across 
quartiles of NT-proBNP; participants with NT-proBNP in the top versus the bottom 
quartile had a hazard ratio of 2.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.5). There was 
no impact of added adjustment for kidney function and heart failure. Among 
pathogenetic stroke subtypes, the association was largest for cardioembolic 
stroke, with a hazard ratio of 9.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.9-29.2). 
Associations did not differ by age, sex, or race, or after excluding those with 
baseline heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Predicted stroke risk was more 
accurate in 27% of participants if NT-proBNP was considered after traditional 
stroke risk factors (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: NT-proBNP was a major independent risk marker for stroke. 
Considering this and other data for stroke, coronary disease, and atrial 
fibrillation, the clinical use of NT-proBNP measurement in primary prevention 
settings should be considered.
