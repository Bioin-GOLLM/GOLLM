Jasmonate (JA) regulates various plant defense and developmental processes. The 
F-box protein CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) perceives JA signals to mediate 
diverse plant responses including male fertility, root growth, anthocyanin 
accumulation, and defense against abiotic and biotic stresses. In this study, we 
carried out genetic, physiological and biochemical analysis on a series of coi1 
mutant alleles, and found that different amino acid mutations in COI1 
distinctively affect JA-regulated male fertility in Arabidopsis. All the JA 
responses are disrupted by the COI1 mutations W467 in coi1-1, Q343 (coi1-6), 
G369E (coi1-4), G98D (coi1-5), G155E (coi1-7), D452A (coi1-9) and L490A 
(coi1-10), though the coi1-5 mutant (COI1G98D) contains adequate COI1 protein (~ 
60% of wild-type). Interestingly, the low basal level of COI1(E543K) in the 
coi1-8 mutant (~ 10% of wild-type COI1 level) is sufficient for maintaining male 
fertility ( ~50% of wild-type fertility); the coi1-2 mutant with low level of 
COI1(L245F) (~ 10% of wild-type) is male sterile under normal growth condition 
(22°C) but male fertile (~ 80% of wild-type fertility) at low temperature 
(16°C); however, both coi1-2 and coi1-8 are defective in the other JA responses 
(root growth, anthocyanin accumulation, and plant response to the pathogen Pst 
DC3000 infection).
