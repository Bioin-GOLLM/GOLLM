BACKGROUND: CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is an SH3-containing scaffold adaptor 
protein which regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, CD2AP was identified 
as a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by several genome-wide 
association studies. One of the hallmarks of AD is the accumulation of 
aggregated forms of Amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain. In humans, CD2AP AD 
susceptibility locus (rs9349407) is associated with an increased plaque burden. 
Aβ production is highly regulated by endocytosis and is influenced by lysosomal 
function. Lysosomal trafficking is influenced by CD2AP. In this study, we 
decreased CD2AP levels in N2a neuroblastoma cultures and PS1APP mice and 
analyzed Aβ levels and plaque burden.
RESULTS: Our data show that suppressing CD2AP expression using shRNA in 
N2a-APP695 cells results in decreased cell membrane amyloid precursor protein, 
decreased Aβ release and a lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. CD2AP protein is expressed in 
the brain as detected by western blot, and the expression level is dependent on 
gene dosage. In 1-month old PS1APP mice, complete loss of CD2AP in brain 
resulted in a decreased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in brain tissue lysates while there was 
no effect on Aβ deposition or accumulation in PS1APP mice expressing one copy of 
CD2AP.
CONCLUSION: CD2-Associated Protein affects Aβ levels and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in 
vitro. The effect of CD2-Associated Protein on Aβ metabolism is subtle in vivo.
