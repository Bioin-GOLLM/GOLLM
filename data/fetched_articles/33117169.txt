BACKGROUND: The introduction of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by 
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with either oxaliplatin or 
mitomycin C for patients with colorectal peritoneal metastasis (CPM) has 
resulted in a major increase in overall survival. Nonetheless, despite critical 
patient selection, the majority of patients will develop recurrent disease 
within one year following CRS + HIPEC. Therefore, improvement of patient and 
treatment selection is needed and may be achieved by the incorporation of 
genetic biomarkers. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of 
genetic biomarkers in the DNA repair pathway that are potentially predictive for 
treatment outcome of patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases treated with 
CRS + HIPEC with oxaliplatin or mitomycin C.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. 
Given the limited number of genetic association studies of intraperitoneal 
mitomycin C and oxaliplatin in patients with CPM, we expanded the review and 
extrapolated the data from biomarker studies conducted in colorectal cancer 
patients treated with systemic mitomycin C- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.
RESULTS: In total, 43 papers were included in this review. No study reported 
potential pharmacogenomic biomarkers in patients with colorectal cancer 
undergoing mitomycin C-based chemotherapy. For oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, a 
total of 26 genetic biomarkers within 14 genes were identified that were 
signiﬁcantly associated with treatment outcome. The most promising genetic 
biomarkers were ERCC1 rs11615, XPC rs1043953, XPD rs13181, XPG rs17655, MNAT 
rs3783819/rs973063/rs4151330, MMR status, ATM protein expression, HIC1 tandem 
repeat D17S5, and PIN1 rs2233678.
CONCLUSION: Several genetic biomarkers have proven predictive value for the 
treatment outcome of systemically administered oxaliplatin. By extrapolation, 
these genetic biomarkers may also be predictive for the efficacy of 
intraperitoneal oxaliplatin. This should be the subject of further 
investigation.
