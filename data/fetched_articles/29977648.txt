BACKGROUND: Indication of omalizumab in the United States was recently extended 
to include pediatric (6-11 years) uncontrolled moderate-to-severe allergic 
asthma patients.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe baseline characteristics of 
this population from a real-world dataset.
METHODS: Allergic asthma patients and uncontrolled moderate-to-severe allergic 
asthma patients, aged 6-11 years, were identified in the Allergy Partners 
Network Electronic Medical Records (2007-2016). The index date for allergic 
asthma patients was the latest between the second asthma-related visit and the 
allergic status confirmation. Uncontrolled moderate-to-severe allergic asthma 
patients were stratified into omalizumab-exposed (index date) or 
omalizumab-unexposed (index date randomly generated) groups. Characteristics 
were evaluated during the 12-month preindex period.
RESULTS: A total of 5806 allergic asthma, 37 omalizumab-exposed, and 2620 
omalizumab-unexposed patients were selected (mean age approximately 9 years). 
Allergic asthma and omalizumab-unexposed patients were predominantly white 
(70.2% and 61.2%) whereas the majority of omalizumab-exposed were African 
Americans (62.2%). Mean immunoglobulin E was 782.0 IU/ml in allergic asthma 
patients (available in 2.2%), 1134.4 IU/ml in omalizumab-exposed (available in 
100.0%), and 746.1 IU/ml in omalizumab-unexposed (available in 3.1%). Allergic 
asthma patients were less severe than omalizumab-exposed and 
omalizumab-unexposed based on the forced expiratory volume in 1 s as a 
percentage of predicted value (FEV1% predicted) and the Childhood Asthma Control 
Test (C-ACT). FEV1% predicted was below normal (<80%) in 42.4% of 
omalizumab-exposed and 39.1% of omalizumab-unexposed patients, also 63.6% of 
omalizumab-exposed and 46.7% of omalizumab-unexposed had uncontrolled asthma 
(C-ACT score <20). In African American omalizumab-exposed patients, FEV1% 
predicted was below normal in 47.6% and 55.0% had uncontrolled asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, pediatric patients with uncontrolled 
moderate-to-severe allergic asthma have a significant disease burden as shown by 
high rates of poor lung function, disease control, and symptoms. Currently 
available treatments could help improve disease management in this population.
