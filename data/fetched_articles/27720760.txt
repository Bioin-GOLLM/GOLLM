Altered innate immunity is a feature of certain skin inflammatory diseases such 
as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD). In this study, we provide evidence that 
deficiency in Trim32 (a tripartite motif [TRIM] protein with innate antiviral 
activity) contributes to a T helper type 2 biased response and predisposes to 
features of AD in mice. On treatment with the toll-like receptor 7 agonist 
imquimod (IMQ), Trim32 knockout mice displayed compromised psoriasiform 
phenotypes and defective T helper type 17 response. Instead, IMQ treatment of 
Trim32 knockout mice induced AD-like phenotypes with enhanced skin infiltration 
of eosinophils and mast cells, elevation of T helper type 2 cytokines/chemokines 
expression, and reduced expression of filaggrin protein expression. Furthermore, 
although the induction of phosphorylated Stat3 and RelA was compromised after 
IMQ treatment in the knockout mice, phosphorylated Stat6 was elevated. CC 
chemokine ligand 20 induction by tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-17A was reduced 
in Trim32-deficient keratinocytes, whereas CC chemokine ligand 5 induction by 
tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-4 was enhanced. In addition, Trim32 protein 
levels were elevated in mice treated with IMQ. Unlike Trim32 overexpression in 
psoriasis, TRIM32 levels were low in patients with AD. Based on Trim32 induction 
by IMQ, the lower levels of TRIM32 in AD skin compared with healthy control and 
psoriatic skin suggest a defective TRIM32 pathway in AD pathogenesis.
