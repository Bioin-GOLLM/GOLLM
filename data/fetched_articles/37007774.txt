Along with the pandemic COVID-19 spreads, new clinical challenges have emerged 
in the health care settings, among which there is a high risk of secondary 
invasive fungal infections with significant mortality. Here, we report a case of 
invasive fungal rhino orbital sinusitis due to the simultaneous co-infection by 
Rhizopus oryzae and Lomentospora prolificans, both identified by sequencing, in 
a 70-year-old Afghanistanian female with COVID-19. The patient was subjected to 
surgical debridement as well as taking liposomal amphotericin B, voriconazole, 
and on discharge, her condition was good. As far as we know, this is the first 
case of co-infection of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) and Lomentospora 
prolificans infection. Multiple fungal co-infections in COVID-19 patients are 
reviewed.
