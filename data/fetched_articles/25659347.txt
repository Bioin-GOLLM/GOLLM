Reduced catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity resulting from genetic 
variation or pharmacological depletion results in enhanced pain perception in 
humans and nociceptive behaviors in animals. Using phasic mechanical and thermal 
reflex tests (e.g. von Frey, Hargreaves), recent studies show that acute 
COMT-dependent pain in rats is mediated by β-adrenergic receptors (βARs). In 
order to more closely mimic the characteristics of human chronic pain conditions 
associated with prolonged reductions in COMT, the present study sought to 
determine volitional pain-related and anxiety-like behavioral responses 
following sustained as well as acute COMT inhibition using an operant 10-45°C 
thermal place preference task and a light/dark preference test. In addition, we 
sought to evaluate the effects of sustained COMT inhibition on generalized body 
pain by measuring tactile sensory thresholds of the abdominal region. Results 
demonstrated that acute and sustained administration of the COMT inhibitor OR486 
increased pain behavior in response to thermal heat. Further, sustained 
administration of OR486 increased anxiety behavior in response to bright light, 
as well as abdominal mechanosensation. Finally, all pain-related behaviors were 
blocked by the non-selective βAR antagonist propranolol. Collectively, these 
findings provide the first evidence that stimulation of βARs following acute or 
chronic COMT inhibition drives cognitive-affective behaviors associated with 
heightened pain that affects multiple body sites.
