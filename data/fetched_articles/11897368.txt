The common single nucleotide polymorphism at codon 129 of the prion protein gene 
is a key determinant of the genetic susceptibility to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
(CJD). Recently, a molecular classification of sporadic CJD based on the M129V 
genotype in conjunction with other determinants was proposed. In the present 
study, we describe the development and evaluation of a rapid fluorescent-based 
assay to detect this polymorphism using the LightCycler system. The two 
polymorphic alleles could be clearly distinguished by their melting points at 
52.1 and 60.4 degrees C, representing the 129V and 129M alleles, respectively. 
These results were confirmed by DNA sequencing. We evaluated our test in 400 
patient samples and found no deviations from the expected melting patterns. The 
calculated allele frequency for the M-allele was 0.66. Thus, we have established 
a rapid, reliable fluorescent assay for high-throughput detection of the prion 
protein M129V polymorphism.
