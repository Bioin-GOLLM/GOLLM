The aim of the study was to investigate the cause of recurrent monolateral 
incomplete central retinal vein occlusion in a 44-year-old woman and the 
association between retinal vein occlusion and factor V Leiden. Cardiovascular 
studies, color Doppler of the carotids, complete blood analyses, with 
immunoserology and coagulation tests were performed. Factor V:R 506Q and 
prothrombin 20210G/A mutation were tested by polymerase chain reaction and 
restriction enzyme analyses. DNA analyses showed the patient to be heterozygous 
for factor V:R 506Q mutation, MTHFR gene mutations and homozygous mutation in 
PAI-I. During 12-months follow-up, having starting taking vitamin B12, folic 
acid and acetylsalicylic acid, the patient stayed free from any other ocular 
systemic occlusive vascular accident. The R506Q factor V gene mutation may be 
associated with reccurrent incomplete central vein occlusion. Genetic studies 
should be promptly done in thrombotic patients to establish specific treatment. 
The complex etiology, inaccurate diagnosis and increase in the incidence of 
occlusion syndrome call for interdisciplinary approach including internists to 
better elucidate the etiology and to introduce appropriate methods of treatment.
