The stem-loop II motif (s2m) is a RNA structural element that is found in the 3' 
untranslated region (UTR) of many RNA viruses including severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Though the motif was discovered over 
twenty-five years ago, its functional significance is unknown. In order to 
understand the importance of s2m, we created viruses with deletions or mutations 
of the s2m by reverse genetics and also evaluated a clinical isolate harboring a 
unique s2m deletion. Deletion or mutation of the s2m had no effect on growth in 
vitro , or growth and viral fitness in Syrian hamsters in vivo . We also 
compared the secondary structure of the 3' UTR of wild type and s2m deletion 
viruses using SHAPE-MaP and DMS-MaPseq. These experiments demonstrate that the 
s2m forms an independent structure and that its deletion does not alter the 
overall remaining 3'UTR RNA structure. Together, these findings suggest that s2m 
is dispensable for SARS-CoV-2.
IMPORTANCE: RNA viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2) contain functional structures to support virus replication, 
translation and evasion of the host antiviral immune response. The 3' 
untranslated region of early isolates of SARS-CoV-2 contained a stem-loop II 
motif (s2m), which is a RNA structural element that is found in many RNA 
viruses. This motif was discovered over twenty-five years ago, but its 
functional significance is unknown. We created SARS-CoV-2 with deletions or 
mutations of the s2m and determined the effect of these changes on viral growth 
in tissue culture and in rodent models of infection. Deletion or mutation of the 
s2m element had no effect on growth in vitro , or growth and viral fitness in 
Syrian hamsters in vivo . We also observed no impact of the deletion on other 
known RNA structures in the same region of the genome. These experiments 
demonstrate that the s2m is dispensable for SARS-CoV-2.
