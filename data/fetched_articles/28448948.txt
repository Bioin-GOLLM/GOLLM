BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) is involved in the development of major depressive disorder. The aim of 
this study is to investigate the interaction between vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) polymorphism (+405G/C, rs2010963) and negative life events in the 
pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD).
METHODS: DNA genotyping was performed on peripheral blood leukocytes in 274 
patients with MDD and 273 age-and sex-matched controls. The frequency and 
severity of negative life events were assessed by the Life Events Scale (LES). A 
logistics method was employed to assess the gene-environment interaction (G×E).
RESULTS: Differences in rs2010963 genotype distributions were observed between 
MDD patients and controls. Significant G×E interactions between allelic 
variation of rs2010963 and negative life events were observed. Individuals 
carrying the C alleles were susceptible to MDD only when exposed to 
high-negative life events.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that interactions between the VEGF rs2010963 
polymorphism and environment increases the risk of developing MDD.
