BACKGROUND: Mutations in LMNA gene encoding two ubiquitously expressed nuclear 
proteins, lamins A and C, give rise to up to 7 different pathologies affecting 
specific tissues. Three of these disorders affect cardiac and/or skeletal 
muscles with atrio-ventricular conduction disturbances, dilated cardiomyopathy 
and sudden cardiac death as common features.
RESULTS: A new LMNA mutation (1621C>T, R541C) was found in two members of a 
French family with a history of ventricular rhythm disturbances and an uncommon 
form of systolic left ventricle dysfunction. The two patients: the proband and 
his daughter, were affected and exhibited an atypical form of dilated 
cardiomyopathy with an unexplained left ventricle aneurysm revealed by 
ventricular rhythm disturbances without atrio-ventricular block.
CONCLUSION: This finding reinforces the highly variable phenotypic expression of 
LMNA mutation and emphasizes the fact that LMNA mutations can be associated with 
different cardiac phenotypes.
