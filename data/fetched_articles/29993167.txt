Leishmania parasitophorous vacuole membranes display phosphoinositides that 
create conditions for continuous Akt activation and a target for miltefosine in 
Leishmania infections.

Miltefosine is an important drug for the treatment of leishmaniasis; however, 
its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. In these studies, we tested 
the hypothesis that like in cancer cells, miltefosine's efficacy in 
leishmaniasis is due to its inhibition of Akt activation in host cells. We show 
using pharmacologic agents that block Akt activation by different mechanisms and 
also using an inducible knockdown approach that miltefosine loses its efficacy 
when its access to Akt1 is limited. Interestingly, limitation of Akt activation 
results in clearance of established Leishmania infections. We then show, using 
fluorophore-tagged probes that bind to phosphoinositides, that Leishmania 
parasitophorous vacuole membranes (LPVMs) display the relevant phosphoinositides 
to which Akt can be recruited and activated continuously. Taken together, we 
propose that the acquisition of PI(4) P and the display of PI (3,4)P2 on LPVMs 
initiate the machinery that supports continuous Akt activation and sensitivity 
to miltefosine.
