Effects of UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 genetic polymorphisms on irinotecan-induced 
severe toxicities in Asian cancer patients are inconclusive. Also, ABCC2 
c.3972C>T may affect toxicity of irinotecan. The aim was to assess the 
aggregated risk of neutropenia or diarrhea in Asian cancer patients taking 
irinotecan and inherited UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*28, or ABCC2 c.3972C>T genetic 
variants. A PubMed literature search for eligible studies was conducted. Odds 
ratios (ORs) were measured using RevMan software where p values <0.05 were 
statistically significant. Patients that inherited both UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 
genetic variants (heterozygous: UGT1A1*1/*6 + *1/*28 and homozygous: 
UGT1A1*6/*6 + *28/*28) were significantly associated with increased risk of 
neutropenia and diarrhea compared to patients with UGT1A1*1/*1 (neutropenia: OR 
2.89; 95% CI 1.97-4.23; p < 0.00001; diarrhea: OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.71-2.99; 
p < 0.00001). Patients carrying homozygous variants had much stronger effects in 
developing toxicities (neutropenia: OR 6.23; 95% CI 3.11-12.47; p < 0.00001; 
diarrhea: OR 3.21; 95% CI 2.13-4.85; p < 0.00001) than those with heterozygous 
variants. However, patients carrying the ABCC2 c.3972C>T genetic variant were 
not significantly associated with neutropenia (OR 1.67; 95% CI 0.98-2.84; 
p = 0.06) and were significantly associated with a reduction in 
irinotecan-induced diarrhea (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.81; p = 0.02). Asian cancer 
patients should undergo screening for both UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 genetic 
variants to reduce substantially irinotecan-induced severe toxicities.
