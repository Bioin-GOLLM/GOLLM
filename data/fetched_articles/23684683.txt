There are few areas in cardiology in which the impact of genetics and genetic 
testing on clinical management has been as great as in cardiac channelopathies, 
arrhythmic disorders of genetic origin related to the ionic control of the 
cardiac action potential. Among the growing number of diseases identified as 
channelopathies, 3 are sufficiently prevalent to represent significant clinical 
and societal problems and to warrant adequate understanding by practicing 
cardiologists: long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular 
tachycardia, and Brugada syndrome. This review will focus selectively on the 
impact of genetic discoveries on clinical management of these 3 diseases. For 
each disorder, we will discuss to what extent genetic knowledge and clinical 
genetic test results modify the way cardiologists should approach and manage 
affected patients. We will also address the optimal use of genetic testing, 
including its potential limitations and the potential medico-legal implications 
when such testing is not performed. We will highlight how important it is to 
understand the ways that genotype can affect clinical manifestations, risk 
stratification, and responses to the therapy. We will also illustrate the close 
bridge between molecular biology and clinical medicine, and will emphasize that 
consideration of the genetic basis for these heritable arrhythmia syndromes and 
the proper use and interpretation of clinical genetic testing should remain the 
standard of care.
