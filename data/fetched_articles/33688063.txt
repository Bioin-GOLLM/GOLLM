Extensive global sampling and sequencing of the pandemic virus severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have enabled researchers to 
monitor its spread and to identify concerning new variants. Two important 
determinants of variant spread are how frequently they arise within individuals 
and how likely they are to be transmitted. To characterize within-host diversity 
and transmission, we deep-sequenced 1313 clinical samples from the United 
Kingdom. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by low levels of within-host 
diversity when viral loads are high and by a narrow bottleneck at transmission. 
Most variants are either lost or occasionally fixed at the point of 
transmission, with minimal persistence of shared diversity, patterns that are 
readily observable on the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that 
transmission-enhancing and/or immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to 
arise infrequently but could spread rapidly if successfully transmitted.
