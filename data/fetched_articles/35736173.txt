Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers diagnosed and the leading 
cause of cancer-related death in women. Although there are first-line treatments 
for BC, drug resistances and adverse events have been reported. Given the 
incidence of BC keeps increasing, seeking novel therapeutics is urgently needed. 
Fucoxanthin (Fx) is a dietary carotenoid commonly found in seaweeds and diatoms. 
Both in vitro and in vivo studies show that Fx and its deacetylated metabolite 
fucoxanthinol (Fxol) inhibit and prevent BC growth. The NF-ÎºB signaling pathway 
is considered the major pathway contributing to the anti-proliferation, 
anti-angiogenesis and pro-apoptotic effects of Fx and Fxol. Other signaling 
molecules such as MAPK, MMP2/9, CYP and ROS are also involved in the anti-cancer 
effects by regulating the tumor microenvironment, cancer metastasis, carcinogen 
metabolism and oxidation. Besides, Fx also possesses anti-obesity effects by 
regulating UCP1 levels and lipid metabolism, which may help to reduce BC risk. 
More importantly, mounting evidence demonstrates that Fx overcomes drug 
resistance. This review aims to give an updated summary of the anti-cancer 
effects of Fx and summarize the underlying mechanisms of action, which will 
provide novel strategies for the development of Fx as an anti-cancer therapeutic 
agent.
