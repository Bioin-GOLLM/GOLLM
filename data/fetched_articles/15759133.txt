A 52-year-old man, who had developed distal muscle weakness in legs and arms, 
was found to have distal muscle atrophy as well as cardiac arrhythmia. His 
10-year younger brother developed restrictive cardiomyopathy at the age of 20 
years, which required cardiac transplantation at the age of 41 years. Skeletal 
muscle biopsy specimens of the older brother revealed granulofilamentous 
material and plaques containing numerous proteins, foremost desmin, as did 
cardiac biopsy tissue. The explanted heart of the younger brother showed similar 
protein-rich plaques and granulofilamentous material within cardiac myocytes. A 
novel heterozygous Glu245Asp (E245D) missense mutation in exon 3 of the desmin 
gene (DES) at 2q35 was found in the older brother. While clinical data and 
muscle biopsy pathology of the older brother conform to the nosological spectrum 
of desminopathies, the early-onset cardiomyopathy, a similar cardiac pathology 
as in skeletal muscle tissues and a novel missense mutation in the DES gene, 
enlarge the nosological spectrum of desminopathies.
