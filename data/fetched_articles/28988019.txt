INTRODUCTION: Acute intermittent porphyria is a rare autosomal dominant 
metabolic disease. It is caused by a genetic mutation that results in deficiency 
of porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme, the third enzyme in heme biosynthesis. 
Acute intermittent porphyria precipitated by surgery is very rare.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 24 year-old woman who developed acute 
intermittent porphyria five days after right hemi-colectomy. Her presentation 
included neuro-visceral and psychiatric manifestations, and severe hyponatremia. 
She received critical care symptomatic management including mechanical 
ventilation. The diagnosis was based on a positive urine test for 
porphobilinogen and confirmed by the presence of a heterozygous mutation in the 
hydroxyrmethylbilane synthase (HMBS) gene (c.760delC p Leu254).
DISCUSSION: Acute intermittent porphyria is the most common and life threatining 
type of acute porphyrias. It is more common in women and usually presents after 
puberty with acute abdominal pain and diverse neuro-psychiatric manifestations 
that can be confused with several surgical and medical diseases. Acute 
intermittent porphyria after surgery is most likely due to postoperative pain 
and low-calorie intake. Once suspected, prompt ICU management including high 
calorie intake are necessary to avoid serious complications and mortality before 
starting definitive treatment with hematin.
CONCLUSION: Acute intermittent porphyria should be suspected in any patient, 
particularly young women, who develop diverse neuro-visceral and psychiatric 
manifestations and hyponatremia after surgery.
