BACKGROUND: Brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVM) may rupture causing 
disability or death. BAVM vessels are characterized by abnormally high flow that 
in general triggers expansive vessel remodeling mediated by cyclo-oxygenase-2 
(COX2), the target of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We investigated 
whether COX2 is expressed in bAVMs and whether it associates with inflammation 
and haemorrhage in these lesions.
METHODS: Tissue was obtained from surgery of 139 bAVMs and 21 normal Circle of 
Willis samples. The samples were studied with immunohistochemistry and real-time 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Clinical data was collected 
from patient records.
RESULTS: COX2 expression was found in 78% (109/139) of the bAVMs and localized 
to the vessels' lumen or medial layer in 70% (95/135) of the bAVMs. Receptors 
for prostaglandin E2, a COX2-derived mediator of vascular remodeling, were found 
in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells and perivascular inflammatory cells 
of bAVMs. COX2 was expressed by infiltrating inflammatory cells and correlated 
with the extent of inflammation (r = .231, p = .007, Spearman rank correlation). 
COX2 expression did not associate with haemorrhage.
CONCLUSION: COX2 is induced in bAVMs, and possibly participates in the 
regulation of vessel wall remodelling and ongoing inflammation. Role of COX2 
signalling in the pathobiology and clinical course of bAVMs merits further 
studies.
