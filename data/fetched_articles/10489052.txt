BACKGROUND: The peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22) gene has four transmembrane 
domains, two extracellular loops, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Its roles in the 
peripheral nervous system remain unclear. The most common cause of 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1A (CMT1A) is a PMP22 gene duplication. 
Missense point mutations in the transmembrane domains are rare alternative 
causes that have undetermined pathogenetic mechanisms.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the phenotype-to-genotype correlations in a pedigree 
with unusual CMT1A.
METHODS: We identified a pedigree with an autosomal dominant motor-sensory 
neuropathy and severely reduced nerve conduction velocities who did not have the 
PMP22 duplication. Specimens from sural nerve biopsies from two patients of 
different ages were evaluated morphometrically. By automated direct nucleotide 
sequencing we analyzed PMP22 and the gene of the major structural myelin protein 
zero (P0).
RESULTS: Nucleotide 159 of PMP22 showed an A-to-T heterozygous mutation, 
predicted to cause an aspartate-to-valine substitution at codon 37 in the first 
extracellular loop of the protein. The mutation co-segregated with the disease 
in the pedigree and was absent in 80 healthy controls. The histopathologic 
phenotype was a de-remyelinating neuropathy with onion bulb formations, 
characterized by prominent uncompaction of the myelin sheath in the majority of 
fibers and by frequent tomacula.
CONCLUSION: We have described a novel mutation in the first extracellular loop 
of PMP22 associated with an atypical CMT1A that overlaps pathologically with 
CMT1B caused by point mutations in the extracellular domain of P0.
