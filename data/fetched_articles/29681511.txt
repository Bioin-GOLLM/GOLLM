Gliomas comprise heterogeneous malignant glial and stromal cells. While blood 
vessel co-option is a potential mechanism to escape anti-angiogenic therapy, the 
relevance of glial phenotype in this process is unclear. We show that Olig2+ 
oligodendrocyte precursor-like glioma cells invade by single-cell vessel 
co-option and preserve the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Conversely, Olig2-negative 
glioma cells form dense perivascular collections and promote angiogenesis and 
BBB breakdown, leading to innate immune cell activation. Experimentally, Olig2 
promotes Wnt7b expression, a finding that correlates in human glioma profiling. 
Targeted Wnt7a/7b deletion or pharmacologic Wnt inhibition blocks Olig2+ glioma 
single-cell vessel co-option and enhances responses to temozolomide. Finally, 
Olig2 and Wnt7 become upregulated after anti-VEGF treatment in preclinical 
models and patients. Thus, glial-encoded pathways regulate distinct 
glioma-vascular microenvironmental interactions.
