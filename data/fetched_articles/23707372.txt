BACKGROUND & AIMS: Anemia is a common adverse effect of telaprevir (TVR) in 
combination with pegylated interferon (PegIFN)α and ribavirin (RBV) therapy. It 
occurs at a higher incidence with the TVR relative to PegIFNα and RBV alone. We 
herein evaluate the baseline and on-treatment predictors of the development of 
severe anemia by chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients receiving TVR-based 
triple therapy.
METHODS: This prospective, multicenter study consisted of 292 patients (median 
age: 62 years) infected with HCV genotype 1. All received 12 weeks of TVR in 
combination with 24 weeks of PegIFNα2b and RBV. The definition of severe anemia 
during antiviral treatment is hemoglobin (Hb)<85 g/L.
RESULTS: 101 (34.6%) patients developed severe anemia during the treatment 
period. Multivariable logistic regression analysis of possible pretreatment 
predictors of the development of severe anemia extracted baseline Hb < 135 g/L 
(Hazard ratio [HR], 2.53; p = 0.0013), estimated glomerular filtration rate <80 
ml/min/1.73 m(2) (HR, 1.83; p = 0.0265), and inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) CC 
genotype (rs1127354) (HR, 2.91; p = 0.0024). For patients with ITPA CC (n = 
227), multivariable logistic regression analysis of possible pretreatment and 
on-treatment predictors of the development of severe anemia extracted Hb level 
at week 2 (HR, 0.96; p = 0.0085) and the initial four weeks of weight-adjusted 
TVR (HR, 1.05; p = 0.0281).
CONCLUSIONS: Anemia remains a risk for all patients treated with TVR-based 
triple therapy. However, ITPA polymorphism (rs1127354) is useful for predicting 
the development of severe anemia and will be helpful in the management of 
treatment.
