Parkinson's disease is characterized by abundant α-synuclein (α-Syn) neuronal 
inclusions, known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and the massive loss of 
midbrain dopamine neurons. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between Lewy 
inclusion formation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we found that 
in wild-type nontransgenic mice, a single intrastriatal inoculation of synthetic 
α-Syn fibrils led to the cell-to-cell transmission of pathologic α-Syn and 
Parkinson's-like Lewy pathology in anatomically interconnected regions. Lewy 
pathology accumulation resulted in progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the 
substantia nigra pars compacta, but not in the adjacent ventral tegmental area, 
and was accompanied by reduced dopamine levels culminating in motor deficits. 
This recapitulation of a neurodegenerative cascade thus establishes a 
mechanistic link between transmission of pathologic α-Syn and the cardinal 
features of Parkinson's disease.
