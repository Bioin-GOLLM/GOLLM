Although fluorescent reporters and biosensors have become indispensable tools in 
biological and biomedical fields, fluorescence measurements require external 
excitation light, thereby limiting their use in thick tissues and live animals. 
Bioluminescent reporters and biosensors may potentially overcome this hurdle 
because they use enzyme-catalyzed exothermic biochemical reactions to generate 
excited-state emitters. This review first introduces the development of 
bioluminescent reporters, and next, their applications in sensing biological 
changes in vitro and in vivo as biosensors. Lastly, we discuss chemiluminescent 
sensors that produce photons in the absence of luciferases. This review aims to 
explore fundamentals and experimental insights and to emphasize the 
yet-to-be-reached potential of next-generation luminescent reporters and 
biosensors.
