Biomarker analysis of the NeoSphere study: pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and 
docetaxel versus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, or 
pertuzumab plus docetaxel for the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: NeoSphere showed significantly higher pathologic complete response 
(pCR) with neoadjuvant pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel compared with 
trastuzumab plus docetaxel, pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, or pertuzumab plus 
docetaxel. We assessed associations between human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) pathway-related biomarkers and clinical outcome in response to 
these regimens.
METHODS: Tumor, serum, and whole blood samples were collected at baseline and 
post neoadjuvant treatment before surgery. Associations between biomarkers and 
pCR, and between biomarkers and clinical variables were assessed in the overall 
and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative populations. Changes in 
serum marker levels between baseline and post-neoadjuvant treatment were 
examined.
RESULTS: No markers were associated with pCR across all groups; however, 
significant associations were observed for two markers in individual groups. 
High HER2 was significantly associated with higher pCR rates (P = 0.001) and a 
significant treatment interaction (P = 0.0236) with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and 
docetaxel (odds ratio 2.07, P = 0.01). Low serum transforming growth factor 
alpha (TGFα) was associated with higher pCR rates with pertuzumab plus 
trastuzumab (P = 0.04) without a significant treatment interaction. Presence of 
truncated HER2 did not affect pCR. A non-significant decreased pCR benefit was 
observed consistently across groups in patients with mutated PIK3CA while the 
treatment benefit from pertuzumab was maintained when comparing the trastuzumab 
plus docetaxel and pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel groups. Notably, 
PIK3CA exon 9 mutations were associated with residual disease (pooled groups), 
which was not found for exon 20 mutations. Serum HER2 extracellular domain 
levels were significantly increased between baseline and post-neoadjuvant 
treatment in the non-trastuzumab-treated group, and decreased in the 
trastuzumab-containing groups (likely due to trastuzumab's mechanism of action). 
Differences in biomarker profiles according to ER status were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations of HER2 protein levels with sensitivity 
to pertuzumab, and of PIK3CA exon 9 mutation to lack of sensitivity to 
HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody treatment, warrant further investigation. 
Previously reported findings of truncated forms of HER2 as resistance markers to 
HER2-targeted treatment could not be confirmed in NeoSphere. Conventional HER2 
assessment should continue and HER2 remains the only biomarker suitable for 
patient selection in this population.
