Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is increasingly recognized as a major global 
health problem. Intertwined with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease embraces a spectrum of liver conditions 
spanning from steatosis to inflammation, fibrosis, and liver failure. Compared 
with the general population, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is higher 
among nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients, in whom comprehensive 
cardiovascular risk assessment is highly desirable. Preclinical effects of 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on the heart include both metabolic and 
structural changes eventually preceding overt myocardial dysfunction. 
Particularly, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with enhanced 
atherosclerosis, heart muscle disease, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias, 
with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and 
oxidative stress playing in the background. In this topical review, we aimed to 
summarize current evidence on the epidemiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease, discuss the pathophysiological links between nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease and cardiovascular disease, illustrate nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease-related cardiovascular phenotypes, and finally provide a glimpse on the 
relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiac steatosis, 
mitochondrial (dys)function, and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction.
