Chronic postsurgical pain impacts most amputees, with more than half 
experiencing neuralgic residual limb pain. The transition from normal acute 
postamputation pain to chronic residual limb pain likely involves both 
peripheral and central inflammatory mechanisms. As part of the Veterans 
Integrated Pain Evaluation Research study, we investigated links between 
systemic inflammatory mediator levels and chronic residual limb pain. Subjects 
included 36 recent active duty military traumatic amputees with chronic residual 
limb pain and 40 without clinically significant pain. Blood samples were 
obtained and plasma concentrations of an array of inflammatory mediators were 
analyzed. Residual limb pain intensity and pain catastrophizing were assessed to 
examine associations with inflammatory mediators. Pro-inflammatory mediators 
including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, TNF-β, interleukin (IL)-8, ICAM-1, 
Tie2, CRP, and SAA were elevated in patients with chronic residual limb pain. 
Across all patients, residual limb pain intensity was associated positively with 
levels of several proinflammatory mediators (IL-8, TNF-α, IL-12, TNF-β, PIGF, 
Tie2, SAA, and ICAM-1), and inversely with concentrations of the 
anti-inflammatory mediator IL-13, as well as IL-2 and Eotaxin-3. Pain 
catastrophizing correlated positively with IL-8, IL-12, TNF-β, PIGF, and ICAM-1, 
and inversely with IL-13. Significant associations between catastrophizing and 
residual limb pain intensity were partially mediated by TNF-α, TNF- β, SAA, and 
ICAM-1 levels. Results suggest that chronic postamputation residual limb pain is 
associated with excessive inflammatory response to injury or to inadequate 
resolution of the postinjury inflammatory state. Impact of pain catastrophizing 
on residual limb pain may be because of part to common underlying inflammatory 
mechanisms.
