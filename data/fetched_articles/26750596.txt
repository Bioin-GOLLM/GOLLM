Effector CD8(+) T cells convert from IFN-γ(+) (Tc1) to IL-13(+) (Tc2) cells in 
the presence of IL-4. Underlying regulatory mechanisms are not fully defined. 
Here, we show that addition of 1,25D3, the active form of vitamin D3, during 
CD8(+) T-cell differentiation prevents IL-4-induced conversion to 
IL-13-producers. Transfer of 1,25D3-treated CD8(+) T cells into sensitized and 
challenged CD8(+)-deficient recipients fails to restore development of lung 
allergic responses. 1,25D3 alters vitamin D receptor (VDR) recruitment to the 
Cyp11a1 promoter in vitro and in vivo in the presence of IL-4. As a result, 
protein levels and enzymatic activity of CYP11A1, a steroidogenic enzyme 
regulating CD8(+) T-cell conversion, are decreased. An epistatic effect between 
CYP11A1 and VDR polymorphisms may contribute to the predisposition to childhood 
asthma. These data identify a role for 1,25D3 in the molecular programming of 
CD8(+) T-cell conversion to an IL-13-secreting phenotype through regulation of 
steroidogenesis, potentially governing asthma susceptibility.
