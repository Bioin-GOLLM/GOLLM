PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M-negative/unknown advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients lack subsequent approved targeted 
therapies. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of osimertinib in 
advanced NSCLC patients with different T790M status after resistance to prior 
first- or second-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and to 
predict the subgroups that may benefit beside T790M-positive disease.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were 
searched for relevant trials. Meeting abstracts were also reviewed to identify 
appropriate studies. Studies evaluating the efficacy and/or survival outcomes of 
osimertinib in patients with different T790M status (positive, negative, or 
unknown) after resistance to prior first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs were 
enrolled, and data were pooled to assess hazard ratios (HRs) or relative risk 
ratios (RRs) in terms of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), 
and objective response rate (ORR).
RESULTS: A total of 1,313 EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients from 10 retrospective and 
one prospective studies treated with osimertinib after resistance to first- or 
second-generation EGFR-TKIs were included. In overall groups, T790M-positive 
patients showed an improved OS (HR=0.574, p=0.015), PFS (HR = 0.476, p = 0.017), 
and ORR (RR = 2.025, p = 0.000) compared with T790M-negative patients. In the 
brain metastases subgroup, no significant difference in OS was observed between 
T790M-positive and T790M-negative patients (HR = 0.75, p = 0.449) or between 
T790M-positive and T790M-unknown patients (HR = 0.90, p = 0.673). In the plasma 
genotyping subgroup, PFS was similar between T790M-positive and T790M-negative 
patients (HR = 1.033, p = 0.959).
CONCLUSION: Patients with progressive brain metastases on first- or 
second-generation EGFR-TKIs can benefit from subsequent osimertinib therapy 
regardless of T790M status. Patients with plasma T790M-negative status and lack 
of tissue genotyping should be allowed to receive osimertinib treatment.
