Variants in NDUFB11, which encodes a structural component of complex I of the 
mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC), were recently independently reported to 
cause histiocytoid cardiomyopathy (histiocytoid CM) and microphthalmia with 
linear skin defects syndrome (MLS syndrome). Here we report an additional case 
of histiocytoid CM, which carries a de novo nonsense variant in NDUFB11 
(ENST00000276062.8: c.262C > T; p.[Arg88*]) identified using whole-exome 
sequencing (WES) of a family trio. An identical variant has been previously 
reported in association with MLS syndrome. The case we describe here lacked the 
diagnostic features of MLS syndrome, but a detailed clinical comparison of the 
two cases revealed significant phenotypic overlap. Heterozygous variants in HCCS 
(which encodes an important mitochondrially targeted protein) and COX7B, which, 
like NDUFB11, encodes a protein of the MRC, have also previously been identified 
in MLS syndrome including a case with features of both MLS syndrome and 
histiocytoid CM. However, a systematic review of WES data from previously 
published histiocytoid CM cases, alongside four additional cases presented here 
for the first time, did not identify any variants in these genes. We conclude 
that NDUFB11 variants play a role in the pathogenesis of both histiocytoid CM 
and MLS and that these disorders are allelic (genetically related).
