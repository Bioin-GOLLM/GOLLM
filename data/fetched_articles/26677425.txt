Hypertension is one of the most common causes of death across the globe. Many 
trials and drugs have been used for controlling the debilitating effects of 
hypertension. One such new class of drug is direct renin inhibitors (DRI), e.g., 
aliskiren, which block the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). It blocks the very 
first step in the RAS system. Multiple trials have been carried out debating the 
outcome of monotherapy and combination therapy with other classes of 
hypertensive drugs. Focus on compliance, adverse effects, and the cost have also 
been in the news. Extensive studies are still needed to justify the clinical use 
of a DRI in the effective treatment of hypertension.
