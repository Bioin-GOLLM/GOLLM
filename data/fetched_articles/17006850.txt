Among genetic alterations most important for the initiation of papillary thyroid 
carcinoma (PTC) is mutation T1799A in the BRAF gene which is the most frequent 
event (54.5%) in this type of thyroid cancer. It is seen in all stages, from 
microcarcinoma through clinically overt disease to anaplastic cancer. It has 
been shown that BRAF mutation is correlated with PTC histotype. It is identified 
most frequently in classical PTC and in tall cell variant. Moreover, BRAF 
mutation is described more often in older patients, whereas in young patients 
RET/PTC rearrangements dominate. In PTC cases with BRAF mutation V600E the 
prognosis is poorer, with more cancer invasiveness, metastasis and recurrence. 
The presence of BRAF mutation is related to the specific gene expression 
signature, different than in cancer cases showing RET/PTC rearrangement or no 
known initiating mutation.
