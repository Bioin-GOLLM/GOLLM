In the present study, we report a human-inherited, impaired, adaptive immunity 
disorder, which predominantly manifested as a B cell differentiation defect, 
caused by a heterozygous IKZF3 missense variant, resulting in a 
glycine-to-arginine replacement within the DNA-binding domain of the encoded 
AIOLOS protein. Using mice that bear the corresponding variant and recapitulate 
the B and T cell phenotypes, we show that the mutant AIOLOS homodimers and 
AIOLOS-IKAROS heterodimers did not bind the canonical AIOLOS-IKAROS DNA 
sequence. In addition, homodimers and heterodimers containing one mutant AIOLOS 
bound to genomic regions lacking both canonical motifs. However, the removal of 
the dimerization capacity from mutant AIOLOS restored B cell development. Hence, 
the adaptive immunity defect is caused by the AIOLOS variant hijacking IKAROS 
function. Heterodimeric interference is a new mechanism of autosomal dominance 
that causes inborn errors of immunity by impairing protein function via the 
mutation of its heterodimeric partner.
