INTRODUCTION: The long non-coding RNA, HOTAIR, involved in cancer initiation and 
development.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of present study was to investigate the association of single 
nucleotide polymorphisms in the HOTAIR gene with lymphoma.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 156 individuals with non-Hodgkin 
Lymphoma (NHL), 53 individuals with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and 245 unrelated 
healthy individuals to identify the genotype frequencies of each polymorphism. 
Genotyping of the SNPs (rs920778 T>C, rs1899663 G>T, rs4759314 A>G and 
rs12826786 C>T) was carried out using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The finding showed that rs1899663 variant of HOTAIR gene 
significantly decreased the risk of NHL in codominant, dominant, over-dominant 
and allelic inheritance models. We did not find any association between HOTAIR 
rs12826786, rs920788 and rs4759314 variants and NHL. The results indicated that 
neither the overall chi-square comparison of the cases and controls, nor the 
logistic regression analysis showed any association between HOTAIR polymorphisms 
and HL. Conclusively, our findings showed that rs1899663 of HOTAIR significantly 
decreased the risk of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
