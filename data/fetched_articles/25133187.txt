On the canalicular membranes of hepatocytes, several ABC transporters are 
responsible for the secretion of bile lipids. Among them, ABCB4, also called 
MDR3, is essential for the secretion of phospholipids from hepatocytes into 
bile. The biliary phospholipids are associated with bile salts and cholesterol 
in mixed micelles, thereby reducing the detergent activity and cytotoxicity of 
bile salts and preventing cholesterol crystallization. Mutations in the ABCB4 
gene result in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3, 
intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, low-phospholipid-associated 
cholelithiasis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and cholangiocarcinoma. In vivo and 
cell culture studies have demonstrated that the secretion of biliary 
phospholipids depends on both ABCB4 expression and bile salts. In the presence 
of bile salts, ABCB4 located in nonraft membranes mediates the efflux of 
phospholipids, preferentially phosphatidylcholine. Despite high homology with 
ABCB1, ABCB4 expression cannot confer multidrug resistance. This review 
summarizes our current understanding of ABCB4 functions and physiological 
relevance, and discusses the molecular mechanism for the ABCB4-mediated efflux 
of phospholipids.
