Overexpressed receptors, characteristic of many cancers, have been targeted by 
various researchers to achieve a more specific treatment for cancer. A common 
approach is to use the natural ligand for the overexpressed receptor as a 
cancer-targeting agent which can deliver a chemically or genetically conjugated 
toxic molecule. However, it has been found that the therapeutic efficacy of such 
ligand-drug molecular conjugates can be limited, since they naturally follow the 
intracellular trafficking pathways of the endogenous ligands. Therefore, a 
thorough understanding of the intracellular trafficking properties of these 
ligands can lead to novel design criteria for engineering ligands to be more 
effective drug carriers. This review presents a few commonly used 
ligand/receptor systems where intracellular trafficking considerations can 
potentially improve the therapeutic efficacy of the ligand-drug molecular 
conjugates.
