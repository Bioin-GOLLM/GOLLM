Numerous studies focus on biological roles of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene in 
mammals but little is known about the actual function of TP53 in lower 
vertebrates. In this study, we used an in vivo functional assay in yeast to 
address the transactivation capacity of the flounder TP53 protein. We showed 
that the flounder TP53 acts as a sequence-specific transcription factor which is 
able to transactivate various human promoters containing a p53-responsive 
element (RE). This transcriptional activity was completely abrogated in the 
Val147Glu TP53 mutant previously identified in two flounder hepatic hyperplasia. 
In addition, we showed that the wild-type (wt) flounder TP53 but not the 
Val147Glu mutant inhibits cell growth when expressed in yeast. We finally 
reported that transcription regulation and growth inhibition by the wild-type 
flounder TP53 is temperature-dependent. The flounder TP53 optimal temperature 
appeared lower than those reported for the Xenopus and human homologues.
