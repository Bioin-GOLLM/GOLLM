Prions are the etiological agent of fatal neurodegenerative diseases called 
prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. These maladies can 
be sporadic, genetic or infectious disorders. Prions are due to 
post-translational modifications of the cellular prion protein leading to the 
formation of a β-sheet enriched conformer with altered biochemical properties. 
The molecular events causing prion formation in sporadic prion diseases are 
still elusive. Recently, we published a research elucidating the contribution of 
major structural determinants and environmental factors in prion protein folding 
and stability. Our study highlighted the crucial role of octarepeats in 
stabilizing prion protein; the presence of a highly enthalpically stable 
intermediate state in prion-susceptible species; and the role of disulfide 
bridge in preserving native fold thus avoiding the misfolding to a β-sheet 
enriched isoform. Taking advantage from these findings, in this work we present 
new insights into structural determinants of prion protein folding and 
stability.
