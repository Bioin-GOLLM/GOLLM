A small proportion of breast cancers are due to a heritable predisposition. 
Recently, two predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, have been identified and 
cloned. The morphological features of tumours from patients harbouring mutations 
in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes differ from each other and from sporadic breast 
cancers. Both are of higher grade than are sporadic cases. An excess of 
medullary/atypical medullary carcinoma has been reported in patients with BRCA1 
mutations. Multifactorial analysis, however, shows that the only features 
independently associated with BRCA1 mutations are a high mitotic count, pushing 
tumour margins and a lymphocytic infiltrate. For BRCA2 mutation, an association 
with tubular/lobular carcinoma has been suggested, but not substantiated in a 
larger Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium study. In multifactorial analysis, the 
independent features were a lack of tubule formation and pushing tumour margins 
only. The morphological analysis has implications for clinical management of 
patients.
