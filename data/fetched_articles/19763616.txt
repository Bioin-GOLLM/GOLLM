Interstitial deletions or apparently balanced translocations involving bands 
1p31 and 1p32 in the short arm of chromosome 1 are rarely described chromosomal 
imbalances. To our knowledge, there have been six cases documented to date. Five 
of these cases, where the NFIA gene is involved, show complex central nervous 
system malformations and in some cases urinary tract defects. We report another 
case of a microdeletion with involvement of the NFIA gene in the short arm of 
chromosome 1 (del(1)(p31.3p32.2)) with, amongst other features, hypoplasia of 
the corpus callosum, ventriculomegaly, and dysmorphic features. A microdeletion 
1p31.3p32.2 which includes the NFIA gene is associated with hypoplasia of the 
corpus callosum, ventriculomegaly, and dysmorphic features.
