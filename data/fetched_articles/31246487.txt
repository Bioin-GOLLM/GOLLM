This update of the Scianna blood group system (Brunker PA, Flegel WA. Scianna: 
the lucky 13th blood group system. Immunohematology 2011;27:41-57) provides the 
recent work on the genetic variation of ERMAP across more world populations, the 
elucidation of the molecular basis of an historical serologic case, new cases of 
antibodies in the system, the development of new serologic reagents, and new 
discoveries in the biology of the erythroid membrane associated protein (ERMAP). 
Although genetic variation in ERMAP has been extensively cataloged, 
nonsynonymous variants associated with alloantigens have remained limited, and 
no new antigens have been identified. The first case of a severe hemolytic 
transfusion reaction to anti-Sc2 has recently been reported, highlighting the 
importance of pursuing the possibility of antibodies to low-prevalence antigens 
via indirect antiglobulin testing as a routine component of all transfusion 
reaction investigations. The expanding use of molecular testing in blood centers 
and transfusion services has uncovered a wider population distribution of 
Scianna antigens and heightened the awareness of this blood group system. The 
International Society of Blood Transfusion recognizes seven antigens in the 
Scianna blood group system 13.
