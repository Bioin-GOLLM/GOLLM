PURPOSE: Panobinostat, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, enhances 
antiproliferative activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines when 
combined with erlotinib. We evaluated this combination in patients with advanced 
NSCLC and head and neck cancer.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible patients were enrolled in a 3+3 dose-escalation 
design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of twice weekly 
panobinostat plus daily erlotinib at four planned dose levels (DL). 
Pharmacokinetics, blood, fat pad biopsies (FPB) for histone acetylation, and 
paired pre and posttherapy tumor biopsies for checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) 
expression were assessed.
RESULTS: Of 42 enrolled patients, 33 were evaluable for efficacy. Dose-limiting 
toxicities were prolonged-QTc and nausea at DL3. Adverse events included fatigue 
and nausea (grades 1-3), and rash and anorexia (grades 1-2). Disease control 
rates were 54% for NSCLC (n = 26) and 43% for head and neck cancer (n = 7). Of 7 
patients with NSCLC with EGF receptor (EGFR) mutations, 3 had partial response, 
3 had stable disease, and 1 progressed. For EGFR-mutant versus EGFR wild-type 
patients, progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.7 versus 1.9 months (P = 0.43) 
and overall survival was 41 (estimated) versus 5.2 months (P = 0.39). Erlotinib 
pharmacokinetics was not significantly affected. Correlative studies confirmed 
panobinostat's pharmacodynamic effect in blood, FPB, and tumor samples. Low CHK1 
expression levels correlated with PFS (P = 0.006) and response (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: We determined MTD at 30 mg (panobinostat) and 100 mg (erlotinib). 
Further studies are needed to further explore the benefits of HDAC inhibitors in 
patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, investigate FPB as a potential surrogate source 
for biomarker investigations, and validate CHK1's predictive role.
