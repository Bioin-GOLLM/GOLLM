The NOS1AP gene encodes a cytosolic protein that binds to the signaling cascade 
component neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). It is associated with many 
different disorders, such as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
autism, cardiovascular disorders, and breast cancer. The NOS1AP (also known as 
CAPON) protein mediates signaling within a complex which includes the NMDA 
receptor, PSD-95, and nNOS. This adapter protein is involved in neuronal nitric 
oxide (NO) synthesis regulation via its association with nNOS (NOS1). Our 
bioinformatics analysis revealed NOS1AP as an aggregation-prone protein, 
interacting with α-synuclein. Further investigation showed that NOS1AP forms 
detergent-resistant non-amyloid aggregates when overproduced. Overexpression of 
NOS1AP was found in rat models for nervous system injury as well as in 
schizophrenia patients. Thus, we can assume for the first time that the 
molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders include misfolding and 
aggregation of NOS1AP. We show that NOS1AP interacts with α-synuclein, allowing 
us to suggest that this protein may be implicated in the development of 
synucleinopathies and that its aggregation may explain the relationship between 
Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.
