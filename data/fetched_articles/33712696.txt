The influenza B M2 protein forms a water-filled tetrameric channel to conduct 
protons across the lipid membrane. To understand how channel water mediates 
proton transport, we have investigated the water orientation and dynamics using 
solid-state NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 
13C-detected water 1H NMR relaxation times indicate that water has faster 
rotational motion in the low-pH open channel than in the high-pH closed channel. 
Despite this faster dynamics, the open-channel water shows higher orientational 
order, as manifested by larger motionally-averaged 1H chemical shift 
anisotropies. MD simulations indicate that this order is induced by the cationic 
proton-selective histidine at low pH. Furthermore, the water network has fewer 
hydrogen-bonding bottlenecks in the open state than in the closed state. Thus, 
faster dynamics and higher orientational order of water molecules in the open 
channel establish the water network structure that is necessary for proton 
hopping.
