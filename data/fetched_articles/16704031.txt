OBJECTIVE: Many genetic variations have been suggested as genetic risk factors 
for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including 
single nucleotide polymorphisms in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) 
gene. We attempted to elucidate the association between TGFB1 genetic 
polymorphisms and COPD among Koreans.
DESIGN: The genotypes of 102 male patients with COPD and 159 volunteers with 
similar distributions of age, sex and smoking intensity, as well as normal 
pulmonary function, were determined for three previously associated TGFB1 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), -10807G/A (rs2241712) and -509T/C (rs1800469), 
located in or near the promoter, and 29T/C (rs1982073), located in exon 1 of the 
TGFB1 gene.
RESULTS: No significant associations between COPD and the three TGFB1 SNPs could 
be identified. In addition, the haplotypes composed of three TGFB1 SNPs were not 
associated with the presence of COPD.
CONCLUSION: These results differ from previous reports involving Caucasians, and 
might reflect racial differences in the pathogenesis of COPD.
