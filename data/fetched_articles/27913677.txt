In the decade since their discovery, the PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein 
phosphatases (PHLPP) have emerged as critical regulators of cellular 
homeostasis, and their dysregulation is associated with various 
pathophysiologies, ranging from cancer to degenerative diseases, such as 
diabetes and heart disease. The two PHLPP isozymes, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2, were 
identified in a search for phosphatases that dephosphorylate Akt, and thus 
suppress growth factor signaling. However, given that there are over 200 000 
phosphorylated residues in a single cell, and fewer than 50 Ser/Thr protein 
phosphatases, it is not surprising that PHLPP has many other cellular functions 
yet to be discovered, including a recently identified role in regulating the 
epigenome. Both PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 are commonly deleted in human cancers, 
supporting a tumor suppressive role. Conversely, the levels of one isozyme, 
PHLPP1, are elevated in diabetes. Thus, mechanisms to correctly control PHLPP 
activity in cells are critical for normal cellular homeostasis. This review 
summarizes the known functions of PHLPP and its role in disease.
