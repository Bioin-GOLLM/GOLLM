Human erythropoietin is mainly recognized for its hematopoietic function; 
however, by binding to its receptor (EpoR), it can activate different signaling 
pathways as STAT, PI3K, MAPK and RAS to increase cellular differentiation or 
provide neuroprotective effects, among others. A recombinant human 
erythropoietin variant with low glycosylation and without hematopoietic effect 
(EpoL) was purified from skimmed goat milk. Recombinant human erythropoietin 
(Epo) was obtained from CHO cell line and used as control to compare EpoL 
effects. Neuroprotection studies were performed in PC12 cells and rat 
hippocampal slices. Cells were pretreated during 1h with EpoL or Epo and exposed 
to oxidative agents (H2O2 or FCCP); cell viability was assayed at the end of the 
experiment by the MTT method. Hippocampal slices were exposed to 15min of oxygen 
and glucose deprivation (OGD) and the neuroprotective drugs EpoL or Epo were 
incubated for 2h post-OGD in re-oxygenated medium. Cell cultures stressed with 
oxidative agents, and pretreated with EpoL, showed neuroprotective effects of 
30% at a concentration 10 times lower than that of Epo. Moreover, similar 
differences were observed in OGD ex vivo assays. Neuroprotection elicited by 
EpoL was lost when an antibody against EpoR was present, indicating that its 
effect is EpoR-dependent. In conclusion, our results suggest that EpoL has a 
more potent neuroprotective profile than Epo against oxidative stress, mediated 
by activation of EpoR, thus EpoL represents an important target to develop a 
potential biopharmaceutical to treat different central nervous system 
pathologies related to oxidative stress such as stroke or neurodegenerative 
diseases.
