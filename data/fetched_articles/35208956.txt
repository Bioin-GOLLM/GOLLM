This study demonstrates the feasibility of molecular imprinting using a 
functional chain transfer agent sans a functional monomer. Ethylene glycol 
dimethacrylate (EGDMA)-based MIPs were synthesised in the presence of 
thioglycolic acid (TGA) possessing a carboxylic acid group, capable of 
interacting with the chosen test template R,S-(±)-propranolol (PNL) and a labile 
S-H bond to facilitate an efficient chain transfer reaction. Quantitative 1H NMR 
measurements showed high PNL and TGA incorporation within the MIP, indicating an 
efficient chain transfer process and a favourable interaction between PNL and 
TGA. TGA-50, with the lowest amount of CTA, showed the largest imprinting effect 
and an imprinting factor (IF) of 2.1. The addition of MAA to the formulation 
improved the binding capacity of PNL to the MIP but also increased NIP binding, 
resulting in a slightly decreased IF of 1.5. The Kd for the high-affinity sites 
of the TGA/MAA MIP were found to be two times lower (10 ± 1 μM) than that for 
the high-affinity sites of the TGA-only MIPs, suggesting that the incorporation 
of the functional monomer MAA increases the affinity towards the PNL template. 
Selectivity studies, cross-reactivity as well as binary competitive and 
displacement assays showed the TGA-based MIPs to be highly selective towards PNL 
against pindolol and slightly competitive against atenolol. The morphologies of 
the polymers were shown to be affected by the concentration of the TGA, 
transforming into discrete macrospheres (from small aggregates) at a higher TGA 
concentration.
