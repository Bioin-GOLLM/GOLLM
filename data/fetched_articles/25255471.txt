OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the 
Interleukin (IL-29) quantity in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and plasma of 
chronic and aggressive periodontitis patients.
DESIGN: Patients with periodontal health (n=30), chronic generalized 
periodontitis (n=30) and generalized aggressive periodontitis (n=30) were 
subjected to IL-29 quantity estimation in GCF and plasma using enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay and was correlated with IL-29 SNP (rs30461) using polymerase 
chain reaction.
RESULTS: IL-29 concentration in GCF and plasma was highest in aggressive 
periodontitis patients (114.17 ± 95.07pg/ml and 149.69 ± 109.90pg/ml 
respectively). The least concentration was found in subjects with healthy 
periodontium (47.50 ± 37.75pg/ml and 54.52 ± 37.53pg/ml) and in chronic 
periodontitis it was found to be 65.01 ± 41.26pg/ml and 81.17 ± 46.23pg/ml. The 
difference in the quantity of IL-29 in GCF and plasma among different groups was 
statistically significant (p<0.001 and p<0.001 respectively). rs30461 
polymorphism of IL-29 analysis revealed that difference in the prevalence of 
A/A, A/G and G/G genotype among three groups was not statistically significant 
(p=0.097).
CONCLUSION: Increased quantity of IL-29 in GCF and plasma of subjects with 
periodontitis suggests a role in pathogenesis of periodontitis and the SNP 
(rs30461) is not related to susceptibility to periodontitis in this population 
of Indian individuals.
