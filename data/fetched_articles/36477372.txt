5-Methyl-cytosine (5mC) is one of the most important DNA modifications and plays 
versatile biological roles. It is well known that 5mC stabilizes DNA duplexes. 
However, it remains unclear how 5mC affects the kinetics of DNA melting and 
hybridization. Here, we studied the kinetics of unzipping and rezipping using a 
502-bp DNA hairpin by single-molecule magnetic tweezers. Under constant loading 
rates, 5mC increases the unzipping force but counterintuitively decreases the 
rezipping force at various salt and temperature conditions. Under constant 
forces, the non-methylated DNA hops between metastable states during unzipping 
and rezipping, which implies low energy barriers. Surprisingly, the 5mC DNA 
can't rezip after fully unzipping unless much lower forces are applied, where it 
rezips stochastically in a one-step manner, which implies 5mC kinetically 
hinders DNA hybridization and high energy barriers in DNA hybridization. 
All-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the 5mC kinetically hinders 
DNA hybridization due to steric effects rather than electrostatic effects caused 
by the additional methyl groups of cytosines. Considering the possible high 
speed of DNA unzipping and zipping during replication and transcription, our 
findings provide new insights into the biological roles of 5mC.
