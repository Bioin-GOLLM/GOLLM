As a transcriptional factor and the negative regulator of alpha fetal protein 
(AFP), Zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) has a well-established role in 
protection against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, recent studies have 
suggested ZHX2 as an oncogene in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Moreover, mounting evidence has 
illustrated a much broader role of ZHX2 in multiple cellular processes, 
including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, lipid metabolism, and 
immunoregulation. This comprehensive review emphasizes the role of ZHX2 in 
health and diseases which have been more recently uncovered.
