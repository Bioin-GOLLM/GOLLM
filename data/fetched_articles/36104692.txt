BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a common, complex disorder which is underrecognized 
and subject to prolonged delays in diagnosis. It is accompanied by significant 
changes in the eutopic endometrial lining.
METHODS: We have undertaken the first single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) 
comparison of endometrial tissues in freshly collected menstrual effluent (ME) 
from 33 subjects, including confirmed endometriosis patients (cases) and 
controls as well as symptomatic subjects (who have chronic symptoms suggestive 
of endometriosis but have not been diagnosed).
RESULTS: We identify a unique subcluster of proliferating uterine natural killer 
(uNK) cells in ME-tissues from controls that is almost absent from endometriosis 
cases, along with a striking reduction of total uNK cells in the ME of cases 
(p < 10-16). In addition, an IGFBP1+ decidualized subset of endometrial stromal 
cells are abundant in the shed endometrium of controls when compared to cases 
(p < 10-16) confirming findings of compromised decidualization of cultured 
stromal cells from cases. By contrast, endometrial stromal cells from cases are 
enriched in cells expressing pro-inflammatory and senescent phenotypes. An 
enrichment of B cells in the cases (p = 5.8 × 10-6) raises the possibility that 
some may have chronic endometritis, a disorder which predisposes to 
endometriosis.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that characterization of endometrial tissues in ME will 
provide an effective screening tool for identifying endometriosis in patients 
with chronic symptoms suggestive of this disorder. This constitutes a major 
advance, since delayed diagnosis for many years is a major clinical problem in 
the evaluation of these patients. Comprehensive analysis of ME is expected to 
lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to endometriosis and other 
associated reproductive disorders such as female infertility.
