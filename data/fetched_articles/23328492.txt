BACKGROUND: Glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide, is an optic 
neuropathy commonly associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The 
major goals of glaucoma treatments are to lower IOP and protect retinal ganglion 
cells. It has been revealed recently that adenosine and adenosine receptors 
(ARs) have important roles in IOP modulation and neuroprotection.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: This article reviews recent studies on the important roles of 
adenosine and ARs in aqueous humor formation and outflow facility, IOP and 
retinal neuroprotection.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine and several adenosine derivatives increase and/or 
decrease IOP via A2A AR. Activation of A1 AR can reduce outflow resistance and 
thereby lower IOP, A3 receptor antagonists prevent adenosine-induced activation 
of Cl(-) channels of the ciliary non-pigmented epithelial cells and thereby 
lower IOP. A1 and A2A agonists can reduce vascular resistance and increase 
retina and optic nerve head blood flow. A1 agonist and A2A antagonist can 
enhance the recovery of retinal function after ischemia attack. Adenosine acting 
at A3 receptors can attenuate the rise in calcium and retinal ganglion cells 
death accompanying P2X(7) receptor activation.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Evidence suggested that the adenosine system is one of the 
potential target systems for therapeutic approaches in glaucoma.
