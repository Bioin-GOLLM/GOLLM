Stem cells reside in specialized niches that regulate their self-renewal and 
differentiation. The vasculature is emerging as an important component of stem 
cell niches. Here, we show that the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) neural stem 
cell niche contains an extensive planar vascular plexus that has specialized 
properties. Dividing stem cells and their transit-amplifying progeny are tightly 
apposed to SVZ blood vessels both during homeostasis and regeneration. They 
frequently contact the vasculature at sites that lack astrocyte endfeet and 
pericyte coverage, a modification of the blood-brain barrier unique to the SVZ. 
Moreover, regeneration often occurs at these sites. Finally, we find that 
circulating small molecules in the blood enter the SVZ. Thus, the vasculature is 
a key component of the adult SVZ neural stem cell niche, with SVZ stem cells and 
transit-amplifying cells uniquely poised to receive spatial cues and regulatory 
signals from diverse elements of the vascular system.
