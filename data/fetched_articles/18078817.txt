OBJECTIVES: To identify candidate genes in relation to plasma lipid levels in 
Caribbean Hispanics.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 114 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 17 
lipid-related genes were genotyped in 477 Caribbean Hispanics from the Northern 
Manhattan Study (NOMAS). Analyses for each SNP and haplotype were performed to 
evaluate the associations with four lipid traits: high- and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, LDL-C), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol 
(TC).
RESULTS: We identified 19 SNPs at 10 genes that were significantly related to 
lipids (p<0.01), including nine involved in the reverse cholesterol transport 
pathway, and one involved in bile acid synthesis. Three genes, namely the 
apolipoprotein A5, apolipoprotein B and cytochrome p450 polypeptide 7A1 genes, 
accounted for the largest proportion of variation in HDL-C/TG, TC and LDL-C 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative effects of multiple genetic variants led to a 
substantially better prediction of inter-individual variations in lipid levels.
