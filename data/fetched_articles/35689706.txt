BACKGROUND: Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is the most cultivated forage plant as 
a model in legumes. Salinity stress due to Na+ toxicity causes severe, oxidative 
stress as a main reason for program cell death (PCD) in plants. Melatonin 
application can increase plant productivity in response to diverse stressors via 
modulating plant antioxidant mechanisms and PCD inhibition in plants.
RESULTS: Alfalfa roots were subjected to different concentrations of in vitro 
salinity supplemented with melatonin (0.1, 10 and 15 µM) for ten days. 
Application of melatonin under salinity stress reduced ROS, H2O2 and [Formula: 
see text] content and showed a dramatic impact on TTC reduction and augmented 
cell viability. Interestingly, melatonin inhibited caspase 3-like protease 
activity and could decrease DNA fragmentation induced by salinity while 
increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes BI-1, UCP1-UCP2 involved in PCD 
pathway. In contrast, in 300 mM salinity, γVPE gene as a proapoptotic of PCD 
down-regulated significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, present data showed that, melatonin plays a 
major function in preventing PCD in alfalfa root meristem cells. We attempted to 
offer a mechanism for the function of melatonin as an anti-apoptotic agent by 
demonstrating significant actions of melatonin on mitochondria proteins, such as 
UCPs, in a manner similar to animal cells.
