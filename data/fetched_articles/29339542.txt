Cell detachment from the extracellular matrix triggers anoikis. Disseminated 
tumor cells must adapt to survive matrix deprivation, while still retaining the 
ability to attach at secondary sites and reinitiate cell division. In this 
study, we elucidate mechanisms that enable reversible matrix attachment by 
breast cancer cells. Matrix deprival triggered AMPK activity and concomitantly 
inhibited AKT activity by upregulating the Akt phosphatase PHLPP2. The resultant 
pAMPKhigh/pAktlow state was critical for cell survival in suspension, as PHLPP2 
silencing also increased anoikis while impairing autophagy and metastasis. In 
contrast, matrix reattachment led to Akt-mediated AMPK inactivation via 
PP2C-α-mediated restoration of the pAkthigh/pAMPKlow state. Clinical specimens 
of primary and metastatic breast cancer displayed an Akt-associated gene 
expression signature, whereas circulating breast tumor cells displayed an 
elevated AMPK-dependent gene expression signature. Our work establishes a 
double-negative feedback loop between Akt and AMPK to control the switch between 
matrix-attached and matrix-detached states needed to coordinate cell growth and 
survival during metastasis.Significance: These findings reveal a molecular 
switch that regulates cancer cell survival during metastatic dissemination, with 
the potential to identify targets to prevent metastasis in breast cancer. Cancer
