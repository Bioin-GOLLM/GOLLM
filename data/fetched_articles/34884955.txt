Proliferative retinopathies produces an irreversible type of blindness affecting 
working age and pediatric population of industrialized countries. Despite the 
good results of anti-VEGF therapy, intraocular and systemic complications are 
often associated after its intravitreal use, hence novel therapeutic approaches 
are needed. The aim of the present study is to test the effect of the AS1411, an 
antiangiogenic nucleolin-binding aptamer, using in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro 
models of angiogenesis and propose a mechanistic insight. Our results showed 
that AS1411 significantly inhibited retinal neovascularization in the oxygen 
induced retinopathy (OIR) in vivo model, as well as inhibited branch formation 
in the rat aortic ex vivo assay, and, significantly reduced proliferation, cell 
migration and tube formation in the HUVEC in vitro model. Importantly, 
phosphorylated NCL protein was significantly abolished in HUVEC in the presence 
of AS1411 without affecting NFκB phosphorylation and -21 and 221-angiomiRs, 
suggesting that the antiangiogenic properties of this molecule are partially 
mediated by a down regulation in NCL phosphorylation. In sum, this new research 
further supports the NCL role in the molecular etiology of pathological 
angiogenesis and identifies AS1411 as a novel anti-angiogenic treatment.
