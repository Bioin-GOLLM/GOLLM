The title salt, [Mn(C2H6OS)6]I4, is made up from discrete [Mn(DMSO)6]2+ (DMSO is 
dimethyl sulfoxide) units connected through non-classical hydrogen bonds to 
linear I42- tetra-iodide anions. The MnII ion in the cation, situated on a 
position with site symmetry -3., is octa-hedrally coordinated by O atoms of the 
DMSO mol-ecule with an Mn-O distance of 2.1808 (12) Å. The I42- anion contains a 
neutral I2 mol-ecule weakly coordinated by two iodide ions, forming a linear 
centrosymmetric tetra-iodide anion. The title compound is isotypic with the Co, 
Ni, Cu, and Zn analogues.
