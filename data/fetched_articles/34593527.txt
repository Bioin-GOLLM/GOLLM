PURPOSE: To investigate the therapeutic role of a novel telomere-directed 
inhibitor, 6-thio-2'-deoxyguanosine (THIO) in gliomas both in vitro and in vivo.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A panel of human and mouse glioma cell lines was used to 
test therapeutic efficacy of THIO using cell viability assays, flow cytometric 
analyses, and immunofluorescence. Integrated analyses of RNA sequencing and 
reverse-phase protein array data revealed the potential antitumor mechanisms of 
THIO. Four patient-derived xenografts (PDX), two patient-derived organoids 
(PDO), and two xenografts of human glioma cell lines were used to further 
investigate the therapeutic efficacy of THIO.
RESULTS: THIO was effective in the majority of human and mouse glioma cell lines 
with no obvious toxicity against normal astrocytes. THIO as a monotherapy 
demonstrated efficacy in three glioma cell lines that had acquired resistance to 
temozolomide. In addition, THIO showed efficacy in four human glioma cell lines 
grown as neurospheres by inducing apoptotic cell death. Mechanistically, THIO 
induced telomeric DNA damage not only in glioma cell lines but also in PDX tumor 
specimens. Integrated computational analyses of transcriptomic and proteomic 
data indicated that THIO significantly inhibited cell invasion, stem cell, and 
proliferation pathways while triggering DNA damage and apoptosis. Importantly, 
THIO significantly decreased tumor proliferation in two PDO models and reduced 
the tumor size of a glioblastoma xenograft and a PDX model.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study established the therapeutic role of THIO in 
primary and recurrent gliomas and revealed the acute induction of telomeric DNA 
damage as a primary antitumor mechanism of THIO in gliomas.
