Pentobarbital activates GABA(A) receptors and enhances GABA-activated currents. 
A threonine residue (262) in the second membrane spanning region at the 12' 
position in the beta(1) subunit, alpha(1)beta(1)(T12'Q), is necessary for the 
potentiating action of pentobarbital. We examined whether T12'Q-mutated 
receptors expressed in Spodoptera frugipedra (Sf 9) cells responded to direct 
activation by pentobarbital. In both mutant and wild type receptors, 
pentobarbital (100 microM to 1 mM) evoked a current response. The pentobarbital 
EC(50) values were similar; 119 and 158 microM for alpha(1)beta(1) and 
alpha(1)beta(1)(T12'Q) receptors, respectively. The results show it is possible 
to discriminate between agonistic and potentiating effects of pentobarbital, 
suggesting these actions involve separate mechanisms.
