PURPOSE: Osteoporosis affects more than 200 million people worldwide: its 
prevalence increases with age and is actually growing due to the constant 
population aging. Women are at greater risk than men, but in recent years it has 
become increasingly evident that osteoporosis represents a significantly 
important problem also for men. However, osteoporosis in men is still poorly 
studied, underdiagnosed and inadequately treated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an observational study to identify any 
gender disparities in osteoporosis screening. For this purpose we observed 
people consecutively admitted at our Outpatient Service for the Diagnosis of 
Osteoporosis during the last 3 years. Patients underwent clinical and laboratory 
assessment and bone mineral density (BMD) measurements by dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry. Bone turnover serum markers have been evaluated and stratified 
according to gender.
RESULTS: Out of 3,752 patients, 2,376 subjects who met the inclusion criteria 
were identified. As expected, the great majority (94.5%) of the screened 
subjects were women and only 5.4% were men. Women exhibited lower BMD compared 
to men (T-score values: -2.33±1.14 vs. -1.31±1.55; p<0.001), whereas the 
prevalence of fractures in osteoporotic men was significantly higher (50% vs. 
31%; p<0.001). Women had lower vitamin D and higher bone remodeling markers 
compared to men. Secondary osteoporosis was more frequent in men (66.67%) than 
in women (20.83%) and the calculated risk for hip fractures was higher in 
osteoporotic men compared to women (11.47±10.62 vs. 6.87±7.73; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Here we highlighted that men are under-screened for osteoporosis 
and exhibit secondary osteoporosis more frequently than women.
