Patients with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2-negative/Ki-67-high (ER+HER2-Ki-67high) luminal breast cancer have a worse 
prognosis and do not respond to hormonal treatment and chemotherapy. This study 
sought to identify disease-related protein networks significantly associated 
with this subtype, by assessing in-depth proteomes of 10 lesions of high and low 
Ki-67 values (HOT, five; COLD, five) microdissected from the five tumors. 
Weighted correlation network analysis screened by over-representative analysis 
identified the five modules significantly associated with the HOT lesions. 
Pathway enrichment analysis, together with causal network analysis, revealed 
pathways of ribosome-associated quality controls, heat shock response by 
oxidative stress and hypoxia, angiogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation. A 
semi-quantitative correlation of key-protein expressions, protein co-regulation 
analysis, and multivariate correlation analysis suggested co-regulations via 
network-network interaction among the four HOT-characteristic modules. Predicted 
highly activated master and upstream regulators were most characteristic to 
ER-positive breast cancer and associated with oncogenic transformation, as well 
as resistance to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Interestingly, inhibited 
intervention causal networks of numerous chemical inhibitors were predicted 
within the top 10 lists for the WM2 and WM5 modules, suggesting involvement of 
potential therapeutic targets in those data-driven networks. Our findings may 
help develop therapeutic strategies to benefit patients.
