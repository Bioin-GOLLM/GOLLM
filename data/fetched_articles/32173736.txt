AIMS: In long QT syndrome (LQTS) patients, modifier genes modulate the 
arrhythmic risk associated with a disease-causing mutation. Their recognition 
can improve risk stratification and clinical management, but their discovery 
represents a challenge. We tested whether a cellular-driven approach could help 
to identify new modifier genes and especially their mechanism of action.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 
cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) from two patients carrying the same KCNQ1-Y111C 
mutation, but presenting opposite clinical phenotypes. We showed that the 
phenotype of the iPSC-CMs derived from the symptomatic patient is due to 
impaired trafficking and increased degradation of the mutant KCNQ1 and wild-type 
human ether-a-go-go-related gene. In the iPSC-CMs of the asymptomatic (AS) 
patient, the activity of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (Nedd4L) involved in 
channel protein degradation was reduced and resulted in a decreased 
arrhythmogenic substrate. Two single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) on the 
Myotubularin-related protein 4 (MTMR4) gene, an interactor of Nedd4L, were 
identified by whole-exome sequencing as potential contributors to decreased 
Nedd4L activity. Correction of these SNVs by CRISPR/Cas9 unmasked the LQTS 
phenotype in AS cells. Importantly, the same MTMR4 variants were present in 77% 
of AS Y111C mutation carriers of a separate cohort. Thus, genetically mediated 
interference with Nedd4L activation seems associated with protective effects.
CONCLUSION: Our finding represents the first demonstration of the cellular 
mechanism of action of a protective modifier gene in LQTS. It provides new clues 
for advanced risk stratification and paves the way for the design of new 
therapies targeting this specific molecular pathway.
