PURPOSE: Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare, autosomal-recessive disorder 
characterized by microcephaly, impaired postnatal growth, and premature 
pathological aging. It has historically been considered a DNA repair disorder; 
fibroblasts from classic patients often exhibit impaired transcription-coupled 
nucleotide excision repair. Previous studies have largely been restricted to 
case reports and small series, and no guidelines for care have been established.
METHODS: One hundred two study participants were identified through a network of 
collaborating clinicians and the Amy and Friends CS support groups. Families 
with a diagnosis of CS could also self-recruit. Comprehensive clinical 
information for analysis was obtained directly from families and their 
clinicians.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We present the most complete evaluation of Cockayne 
syndrome to date, including detailed information on the prevalence and onset of 
clinical features, achievement of neurodevelopmental milestones, and patient 
management. We confirm that the most valuable prognostic factor in CS is the 
presence of early cataracts. Using this evidence, we have created simple 
guidelines for the care of individuals with CS. We aim to assist clinicians in 
the recognition, diagnosis, and management of this condition and to enable 
families to understand what problems they may encounter as CS progresses.Genet
