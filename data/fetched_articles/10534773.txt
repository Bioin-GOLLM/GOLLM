Germline mutations that give rise to premature termination codons in mRNAs have 
frequently been associated with aberrant processing of the nascent transcripts. 
This can take the form either of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or of aberrant 
splicing of the pre-mRNA. In a family affected by hereditary nonpolyposis 
colorectal cancer, a two-nucleotide deletion in codon 659, which introduces a 
frameshift and a new stop codon in exon 17 of the DNA mismatch repair gene MLH1, 
has been reported to lead to skipping of the exon. We now report that this 
phenomenon occurs also when there are missense or nonsense mutations in this 
codon. Our results thus suggest that in aberrant splicing the nature of the 
mutation may be less important than its position within the exon. These findings 
are of importance to mutation interpretation, as they imply that aberrant 
splicing could be associated even with silent mutations that do not lead to 
amino acid substitutions. Genes Chromosomes Cancer 26:372-375, 1999.
