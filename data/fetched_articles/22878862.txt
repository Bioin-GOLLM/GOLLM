We present molecular modeling of the structure and possible proton transfer 
pathways from the surface of the protein to the zinc-bound water molecule in the 
active site of the mutant His-107-Tyr of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII). No 
high-resolution structure or crystal structure is available till now for this 
particular mutant due to its lack of stability at physiological temperature. Our 
analysis utilizes as starting point a series of structures derived from 
high-resolution crystal structure of the wild type protein. While many of the 
structures investigated do not reveal a complete path between the zinc bound 
water and His-64, several others do indicate the presence of a transient 
connection even when His-64 is present in its outward conformation. Mutation at 
the residue 107 also reveals the formation of a new path into the active site. 
Competing contributions from His-64 sidechain rotation from its outward 
conformation are also evaluated in terms of optimal path analysis. No indication 
of a lower catalytic efficiency of the mutant is evident from our results under 
the condition of thermal stability of the mutant.
