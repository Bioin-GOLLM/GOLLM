Our understanding of the genetics of skin pigmentation has been largely skewed 
towards populations of European ancestry, imparting less attention to South 
Asian populations, who behold huge pigmentation diversity. Here, we investigate 
skin pigmentation variation in a cohort of 1,167 individuals in the Middle 
Gangetic Plain of the Indian subcontinent. Our data confirm the association of 
rs1426654 with skin pigmentation among South Asians, consistent with previous 
studies, and also show association for rs2470102 single nucleotide polymorphism. 
Our haplotype analyses further help us delineate the haplotype distribution 
across social categories and skin color. Taken together, our findings suggest 
that the social structure defined by the caste system in India has a profound 
influence on the skin pigmentation patterns of the subcontinent. In particular, 
social category and associated single nucleotide polymorphisms explain about 32% 
and 6.4%, respectively, of the total phenotypic variance. Phylogeography of the 
associated single nucleotide polymorphisms studied across 52 diverse populations 
of the Indian subcontinent shows wide presence of the derived alleles, although 
their frequencies vary across populations. Our results show that both 
polymorphisms (rs1426654 and rs2470102) play an important role in the skin 
pigmentation diversity of South Asians.
