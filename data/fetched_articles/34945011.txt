Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death. Existing 
therapies only moderately improve pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) 
patient prognosis. The present study investigates the importance of the 
polyamine metabolism in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Relative mRNA 
expression analysis identified differential expression of polyamine 
biosynthesis, homeostasis, and transport mediators in both pancreatic epithelial 
and stromal cells from low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN-1) 
or primary PDAC patient samples. We found dysregulated mRNA levels that encode 
for proteins associated with the polyamine pathway of PDAC tumors compared to 
early lesions. Next, bioinformatic databases were used to assess expression of 
select genes involved in polyamine metabolism and their impact on patient 
survival. Higher expression of pro-polyamine genes was associated with poor 
patient prognosis, supporting the use of a polyamine blockade therapy (PBT) 
strategy for inhibiting pancreatic tumor progression. Moreover, PBT treatment of 
syngeneic mice injected intra-pancreatic with PAN 02 tumor cells resulted in 
increased survival and decreased tumor weights of PDAC-bearing mice. 
Histological assessment of PBT-treated tumors revealed macrophage presence and 
significantly increased expression of CD86, a T cell co-stimulatory marker. 
Collectively, therapies which target polyamine metabolism can be used to disrupt 
tumor progression, modulate tumor microenvironment, and extend overall survival.
