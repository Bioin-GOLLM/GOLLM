The calcium-sensitive type VI adenylyl cyclase (AC6) is a membrane-bound 
adenylyl cyclase (AC) that converts ATP to cAMP under stimulation. It is a 
calcium-inhibited AC and integrates negative inputs from Ca(2+) and multiple 
other signals to regulate the intracellular cAMP level. In the present study, we 
demonstrate that AC6 functions upstream of CREB and negatively controls neuronal 
plasticity in the hippocampus. Genetic removal of AC6 leads to 
cyclase-independent and N-terminus of AC6 (AC6N)-dependent elevation of CREB 
expression, and enhances the expression of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in 
hippocampal neurons. Consequently, GluN2B-dependent calcium signaling and 
excitatory postsynaptic current, long-term depression, and spatial reversal 
learning are enhanced in the hippocampus of AC6(-/-) mice without altering the 
gross anatomy of the brain. Together, our results suggest that AC6 negatively 
regulates neuronal plasticity by modulating the levels of CREB and GluN2B in the 
hippocampus.
