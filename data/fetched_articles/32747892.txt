Ties between schizophrenia (SCZ) and genetics are undeniably significant issue 
prone to be discussed in the nowadays psychology. Recent research on this domain 
focuses more on specific genes and heredity (specifically monozygotic pairs of 
twins) for diagnosing SCZ, than on environmental influences. SCZ is considered a 
multifactorial disease, thought to convert from a merger of risk and biological 
genes and environmental factors that could alter and reshape the trajectory of 
brain development. On this regard, this review sums up recent and innovative 
methods of distinguishing schizophrenic features from other mental illnesses in 
patients, based on chromosomal and genes changes. The term "reverse genetics" is 
no longer up to date, being replaced with "genome scanning" and "positional 
cloning". For many researchers, genome scanning is continuing the reverse of the 
sensible strategy for detecting various important biological disorders, which 
may start from the discovery of a protein or any other molecule involved in a 
biological process, being followed by its gene cloning. Genes being discovered 
in this manner could become candidate genes for the disease. However, genome 
scanning occurs through testing each chromosomal segment (or mitochondrial 
genome) for the counter transmission of the disease.
