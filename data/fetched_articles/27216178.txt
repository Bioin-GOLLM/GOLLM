The glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I, which adds α2-6-linked sialic acids to 
substrate glycoproteins, has been implicated in carcinogenesis; however, the 
nature of its pathogenic role remains poorly understood. Here we show that 
ST6Gal-I is upregulated in ovarian and pancreatic carcinomas, enriched in 
metastatic tumors, and associated with reduced patient survival. Notably, 
ST6Gal-I upregulation in cancer cells conferred hallmark cancer stem-like cell 
(CSC) characteristics. Modulating ST6Gal-I expression in pancreatic and ovarian 
cancer cells directly altered CSC spheroid growth, and clonal variants with high 
ST6Gal-I activity preferentially survived in CSC culture. Primary ovarian cancer 
cells from patient ascites or solid tumors sorted for α2-6 sialylation grew as 
spheroids, while cells lacking α2-6 sialylation remained as single cells and 
lost viability. ST6Gal-I also promoted resistance to gemcitabine and enabled the 
formation of stably resistant colonies. Gemcitabine treatment of patient-derived 
xenograft tumors enriched for ST6Gal-I-expressing cells relative to pair-matched 
untreated tumors. ST6Gal-I also augmented tumor-initiating potential. In 
limiting dilution assays, subcutaneous tumor formation was inhibited by ST6Gal-I 
knockdown, whereas in a chemically induced tumor initiation model, mice with 
conditional ST6Gal-I overexpression exhibited enhanced tumorigenesis. Finally, 
we found that ST6Gal-I induced expression of the key tumor-promoting 
transcription factors, Sox9 and Slug. Collectively, this work highlighted a 
previously unrecognized role for a specific glycosyltransferase in driving a CSC 
state. Cancer Res; 76(13); 3978-88. ©2016 AACR.
