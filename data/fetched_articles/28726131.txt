PURPOSE: The detection of enzyme activities and evaluation of enzyme inhibitors 
have been challenging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To address this 
need, we have developed a diamagnetic, nonmetallic contrast agent and a protocol 
known as catalyCEST MRI that uses chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) 
to detect enzyme activity as well as enzyme inhibition.
PROCEDURES: We synthesized a diamagnetic MRI contrast agent that has enzyme 
responsive and enzyme unresponsive CEST signals. We tested the ability of this 
agent to detect the activity of kallikrein 6 (KLK6) in biochemical solutions, in 
vitro and in vivo, with and without a KLK6 inhibitor.
RESULTS: The agent detected KLK6 activity in solution and also detected KLK6 
inhibition by antithrombin III. KLK6 activity was detected during in vitro 
studies with HCT116 colon cancer cells, relative to the detection of almost no 
activity in a KLK6-knockdown HCT116 cell line and HCT116 cells treated with 
antithrombin III inhibitor. Finally, strong enzyme activity was detected within 
an in vivo HCT116 tumor model, while lower enzyme activity was detected in a 
KLK6 knockdown tumor model and in the HCT116 tumor model treated with 
antithrombin III inhibitor. In all cases, comparisons of the enzyme responsive 
and enzyme unresponsive CEST signals were critical for the detection of enzyme 
activity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has established that catalyCEST MRI with an exogenous 
diaCEST agent can evaluate enzyme activity and inhibition in solution, in vitro 
and in vivo.
