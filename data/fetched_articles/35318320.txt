Functioning as a master kinase, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 
(PDK1) plays a fundamental role in phosphorylating and activating protein 
kinases A, B and C (AGC) family kinases, including AKT. However, upstream 
regulation of PDK1 remains largely elusive. Here we report that ribosomal 
protein S6 kinase beta 1 (S6K1), a member of AGC kinases and downstream target 
of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), directly phosphorylates 
PDK1 at its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and impairs PDK1 interaction with 
and activation of AKT. Mechanistically, S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of PDK1 
augments its interaction with 14-3-3 adaptor protein and homo-dimerization, 
subsequently dissociating PDK1 from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate 
(PIP3) and retarding its interaction with AKT. Pathologically, tumor 
patient-associated PDK1 mutations, either attenuating S6K1-mediated PDK1 
phosphorylation or impairing PDK1 interaction with 14-3-3, result in elevated 
AKT kinase activity and oncogenic functions. Taken together, our findings not 
only unravel a delicate feedback regulation of AKT signaling via S6K1-mediated 
PDK1 phosphorylation, but also highlight the potential strategy to combat mutant 
PDK1-driven cancers.
