Tafenoquine is a highly effective treatment for Babesia microti infections in 
animal models. An immunocompromised patient infected by a strain of B. microti 
that was at least partially resistant to both azithromycin and atovaquone was 
treated with tafenoquine. Systematic clinical studies using tafenoquine for 
treating other patients with babesiosis should be considered.
