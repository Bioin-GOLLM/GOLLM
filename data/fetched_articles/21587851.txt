Ali Q, Raza Shah M, Ng SW.

The title compound, C(17)H(16)O(4), is a dialdehyde in which two formyl-phen-oxy 
units are linked by a -CH(2)CH(2)CH(2)- chain; the mol-ecule is V-shaped with 
the middle methyl-ene C atom as the apex. The two benzene rings are aligned at 
77.4 (1)°. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked into centrosymmetric dimers by 
pairs of non-classical C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds.
