Dropping moisture (DM) refers to the water content of feces. High DM in chickens 
could be disadvantageous to pathogen control and fecal treatment in chicken 
farms. DM can be affected by environment, nutrition, disease, and genetics. In 
the present study, significant individual differences were presented in the DM 
of Rhode Island Red (RIR) chicken population, indicating that genetics could 
contribute to DM in the chickens. Subsequently, we estimated the genetic 
parameters of DM and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find 
the potential genomic regions related to DM. The results showed that the 
heritability of DM ranged from 0.25 to 0.32. Furthermore, 11 significant loci on 
chromosome 7 were found to be associated with DM levels by the GWAS. The SNP 
rs15833816 within the COL6A3 gene was the most significant SNP related to DM. 
Hens carrying the G allele including GA and GG produced higher DM (P < 0.01) 
levels than those carrying the other genotype AA. Our results showed that DM is 
a medium-inheritable trait and that COL6A3 could be a potential candidate gene 
that regulates DM level in chickens.
