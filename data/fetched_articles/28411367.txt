The first aim of our study was to examine the association between common 
variants in VDR [rs2228570 (FokI), rs1544410 (BsmI), rs7975232 (ApaI), rs731236 
(TaqI) and rs11568820 (Cdx2)] and lung cancer risk in the Polish population. 
Genotyping and statistical analysis which included Chi-square test with Yates 
correction and haplotype frequency analysis were performed on a series of 840 
consecutively collected lung cancer patients and 920 healthy controls. The 
second aim was to evaluate the link between serum 25(OH)D concentration and the 
number of lung cancers in a subgroup of 200 patients. A separate control group 
that consisted of 400 matched (by age, sex, smoking habits and the season of 
blood collection) healthy individuals was used to avoid posterior adjustment on 
the matched variables. Statistical analysis with the use of Chi-square test with 
Yates was performed. We found no statistically significant difference in the 
distribution of the allels of studied VDR variants among cases and controls. A 
statistically significant over-representation of VDR haplotypes: 
rs731236_A + rs1544410_T [odds ratio (OR) = 2.43, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 1.11-5.32, p < 0.001], rs731236_G + rs1544410_T (OR = 1.54, 95% 
CI = 1.31-1.81, p < 0.001) and rs731236_G + rs1544410_C (OR = 0.04, 95% 
CI = 0.03-0.07, p < 0.001) was detected. We found a tendency toward an increased 
number of lung cancers among individuals with low serum levels of 25(OH)D. To 
answer the question, whether VDR can be regarded as lung cancer susceptibility 
gene and low 25(OH)D serum levels is associated with lung cancer occurrences, 
additional, multicenter study needs to be performed.
