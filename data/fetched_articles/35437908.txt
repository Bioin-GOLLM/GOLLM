Multiplexed PCR amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) is an increasingly popular 
application for cost-effective monitoring of threatened species and managed 
wildlife populations, and shows strong potential for the genomic epidemiology of 
infectious disease. AmpSeq data from infectious microbes can inform disease 
control in multiple ways, such as by measuring drug resistance marker 
prevalence, distinguishing imported from local cases, and determining the 
effectiveness of therapeutics. We describe the design and comparative evaluation 
of two new AmpSeq assays for Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites: a 
four-locus panel ("4CAST") composed of highly diverse antigens, and a 129-locus 
panel ("AMPLseq") composed of drug resistance markers, highly diverse loci for 
inferring relatedness, and a locus to detect Plasmodium vivax co-infection. We 
explore the performance of each panel in various public health use cases with in 
silico simulations as well as empirical experiments. The 4CAST panel appears 
highly suitable for evaluating the number of distinct parasite strains within 
samples (complexity of infection), showing strong performance across a wide 
range of parasitaemia levels without a DNA pre-amplification step. For 
relatedness inference, the larger AMPLseq panel performs similarly to two 
existing panels of comparable size, despite differences in the data and approach 
used for designing each panel. Finally, we describe an R package (paneljudge) 
that facilitates the design and comparative evaluation of genetic panels for 
relatedness estimation, and we provide general guidance on the design and 
implementation of AmpSeq panels for the genomic epidemiology of infectious 
disease.
