Interleukins are secreted proteins that regulate immune responses. Among these, 
the interleukin 12 (IL-12) family holds a central position in inflammatory and 
infectious diseases. Each family member consists of an α and a β subunit that 
together form a composite cytokine. Within the IL-12 family, IL-35 remains 
particularly ill-characterized on a molecular level despite its key role in 
autoimmune diseases and cancer. Here we show that both IL-35 subunits, IL-12α 
and EBI3, mutually promote their secretion from cells but are not necessarily 
secreted as a heterodimer. Our data demonstrate that IL-12α and EBI3 are stable 
proteins in isolation that act as anti-inflammatory molecules. Both reduce 
secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and induce the development of regulatory 
T cells. Together, our study reveals IL-12α and EBI3, the subunits of IL-35, to 
be functionally active anti-inflammatory immune molecules on their own. This 
extends our understanding of the human cytokine repertoire as a basis for 
immunotherapeutic approaches.
