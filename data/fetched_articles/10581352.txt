OBJECTIVE: To set up a simple method for identifying the mutation of R227Q of 
SRD5alpha2 gene which is one of the most common mutations in congenital 
hypospadias in China.
METHODS: The amplification refractory mutation system(ARMS) was employed in 
detecting the SRD5alpha2 gene R227Q mutation in congenital hypospadias confirmed 
by PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: The ARMS was successfully applied to the detection of the R227Q 
mutation of SRD5alpha2 gene. Three out of 23 congenital hypospadias were 
positive for R227Q mutation. The mutations determined by ARMS were in full 
agreement with those obtained by the DNA sequencing.
CONCLUSION: This is a simple, rapid and accurate method. It can be used for 
detecting the SRD5alpha2 gene R227Q mutation in congenital hypospadias and male 
pseudohermaphroditism.
