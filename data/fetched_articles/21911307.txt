We found that the missense mutation p.Pro1205Leu in the PHKA2 gene is a common 
cause of hepatic phosphorylase-kinase deficiency in Dutch patients, suggesting a 
founder-effect. Most patients presented with isolated growth delay and diarrhea, 
prior to the occurrence of hepatomegaly, delaying diagnosis. Tetraglucoside 
excretion correlated with disease severity and was used to follow compliance. 
The clinical presentation and therapeutic requirements in the same mutation 
carriers were variable, and PhK deficiency necessitated tube-feeding in some 
children.
