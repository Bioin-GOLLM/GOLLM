Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major cause of liver disease 
worldwide. Some genetic variants might be involved in the progression of this 
disease. The study hypothesized that individuals with the rs7359397 T allele 
have a higher risk of developing severe stages of NAFLD compared with 
non-carriers where dietary intake according to genotypes could have a key role 
on the pathogenesis of the disease. SH2B1 genetic variant was genotyped in 110 
overweight/obese subjects with NAFLD. Imaging techniques, lipidomic analysis and 
blood liver biomarkers were performed. Body composition, general biochemical and 
dietary variables were also determined. The SH2B1 risk genotype was associated 
with higher HOMA-IR p = 0.001; and Fatty Liver Index (FLI) p = 0.032. Higher 
protein consumption (p = 0.028), less mono-unsaturated fatty acid and fiber 
intake (p = 0.045 and p = 0.049, respectively), was also referred to in risk 
allele genotype. Lipidomic analysis showed that T allele carriers presented a 
higher frequency of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (69.1% vs. 44.4%; p = 
0.006). In the genotype risk group, adjusted logistic regression models 
indicated a higher risk of developing an advanced stage of NAFLD measured by FLI 
(OR 2.91) and ultrasonography (OR 4.15). Multinomial logistic regression models 
showed that risk allele carriers had higher liver fat accumulation risk (RRR 
3.93) and an increased risk of NASH (RRR 7.88). Consequently, subjects carrying 
the T allele were associated with a higher risk of developing a severe stage of 
NAFLD. These results support the importance of considering genetic 
predisposition in combination with a healthy dietary pattern in the personalized 
evaluation and management of NAFLD.
