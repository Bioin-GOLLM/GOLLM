Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACis) have demonstrated activity in 
hematological and solid malignancies. Vorinostat, romidepsin, belinostat, and 
panobinostat are Food and Drug Administration-approved for hematological 
malignancies and inhibit class II and/or class I HDACs, including HDAC1, 2, 3, 
and 6. We combined genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate whether 
suppression of individual or multiple Hdacs phenocopied broad-acting HDACis in 3 
genetically distinct leukemias and lymphomas. Individual Hdacs were depleted in 
murine acute myeloid leukemias (MLL-AF9;Nras(G12D); PML-RARα acute promyelocytic 
leukemia [APL] cells) and Eµ-Myc lymphoma in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, 
Hdac3-depleted cells were selected against in competitive assays for all 3 tumor 
types. Decreased proliferation following Hdac3 knockdown was not prevented by 
BCL-2 overexpression, caspase inhibition, or knockout of Cdkn1a in Eµ-Myc 
lymphoma, and depletion of Hdac3 in vivo significantly reduced tumor burden. 
Interestingly, APL cells depleted of Hdac3 demonstrated a more differentiated 
phenotype. Consistent with these genetic studies, the HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966 
reduced proliferation of Eµ-Myc lymphoma and induced differentiation in APL. 
Genetic codepletion of Hdac1 with Hdac2 was pro-apoptotic in Eµ-Myc lymphoma in 
vitro and in vivo and was phenocopied by the HDAC1/2-specific agent RGFP233. 
This study demonstrates the importance of HDAC3 for the proliferation of 
leukemia and lymphoma cells, suggesting that HDAC3-selective inhibitors could 
prove useful for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Moreover, our 
results demonstrate that codepletion of Hdac1 with Hdac2 mediates a robust 
pro-apoptotic response. Our integrated genetic and pharmacological approach 
provides important insights into the individual or combinations of HDACs that 
could be prioritized for targeting in a range of hematological malignancies.
