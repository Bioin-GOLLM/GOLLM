BACKGROUND: Regular aspirin use reduces colon adenoma and carcinoma incidence. 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) are involved in aspirin metabolism and 
clearance, and variant alleles in UGT1A6 have been shown to alter salicylic acid 
metabolism and risk of colon neoplasia.
METHODS: In a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial of 44 healthy men 
and women, homozygous for UGT1A6*1 or UGT1A6*2, we explored differences between 
global epithelial and stromal expression, using Affymetrix U133 + 2.0 
microarrays and tested effects of 60-day aspirin supplementation (325 mg/d) on 
epithelial and stromal gene expression and colon prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in gene expression were 
observed in response to aspirin or UGT1A6 genotype, but tissue PGE2 levels were 
lower with aspirin compared to placebo (p <0.001). Transcripts differentially 
expressed between epithelium and stroma (N = 4916, P <0.01, false discovery rate 
<0.001), included a high proportion of genes involved in cell signaling, 
cellular movement, and cancer. Genes preferentially expressed in epithelium were 
involved in drug and xenobiotic metabolism, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, 
apoptosis signaling, and ion transport. Genes preferentially expressed in stroma 
included those involved in inflammation, cellular adhesion, and extracellular 
matrix production. Wnt-Tcf4 pathway genes were expressed in both epithelium and 
stroma but differed by subcellular location.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in healthy individuals, subtle effects 
of aspirin on gene expression in normal colon tissue are likely overwhelmed by 
inter-individual variability in microarray analyses. Differential expression of 
critical genes between colonic epithelium and stroma suggest that these tissue 
types need to be considered separately.
