INTRODUCTION: Oncogenic Kras mutations are important drivers of lung cancer 
development and metastasis. They are known to activate numerous cellular 
signaling pathways implicated in enhanced proliferation, survival, 
tumorigenicity and motility during malignant progression.
OBJECTIVES: Most previous studies of Kras in cancer have focused on the 
comparison of cell states in the absence or presence of oncogenic Kras 
mutations. Here we show that differential expression of the constitutively 
active mutation KrasV12 has profound effects on cell morphology and motility 
that drive metastatic processes.
METHODS: The study relies on lung cancer cell transformation models, 
patient-derived lung cancer cell lines, and human lung tumor sections combined 
with molecular biology techniques, live-cell imaging and staining methods.
RESULTS: Our analysis shows two cell functional states driven by KrasV12 protein 
levels: a non-motile state associated with high KrasV12 levels and 
tumorigenicity, and a motile state associated with low KrasV12 levels and cell 
dissemination. Conversion between the states is conferred by differential 
activation of a mechano-sensitive double-negative feedback between 
KrasV12/ERK/Myosin II and matrix-adhesion signaling. KrasV12 expression levels 
change upon cues such as hypoxia and integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion, 
rendering KrasV12 levels an integrator of micro-environmental signals that 
translate into cellular function. By live cell imaging of tumor models we 
observe shedding of mixed high and low KrasV12 expressers forming 
multi-functional collectives with potentially optimal metastatic properties 
composed of a highly mobile and a highly tumorigenic unit.
DISCUSSION: Together these data highlight previously unappreciated roles for the 
quantitative effects of expression level variation of oncogenic signaling 
molecules in conferring fundamental alterations in cell function regulation 
required for cancer progression.
