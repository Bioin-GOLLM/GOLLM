OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether sequence variants in the gene encoding for 
estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) are risk determinants for fetal loss.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: University medical center.
PATIENT(S): One hundred four women with a history of fetal loss and 277 healthy 
women with at least one previous pregnancy and no previous fetal loss.
INTERVENTION(S): None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The IVS1-401C/T polymorphism of the human ER-alpha, the 
G1691A mutation of the factor V gene (factor V Leiden), the G20210A mutation of 
the prothrombin gene, and the C677T polymorphism of the 
methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) gene were determined by polymerase 
chain reaction.
RESULT(S): In the subgroup analysis of women with at least one late miscarriage 
(n = 70), the prevalences of the ER-alpha IVS1-401 T allele (T/T vs. C/C, odds 
ratio [OR]: 2.85, P=.018; T/T + C/T vs. C/C, OR: 2.28, P=.043) and of 
heterozygous factor V Leiden (OR, 3.2; P=.002) were significantly higher among 
women with late fetal loss than among healthy women. Carriers of both risk 
determinants have an at-least additive increase in risk for late abortions (OR, 
7.0; P=.0004). The population of all late abortions that would be attributable 
to the genetic variants (population attributable risk) was 13.9% for factor V 
Leiden and 49.2% for the ER-alpha IVS1-401 T allele.
CONCLUSION(S): Women with the IVS1-401 T allele of the ER-alpha and/or factor V 
Leiden are at increased risk for late fetal loss.
