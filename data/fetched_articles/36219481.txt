The fluid covering the surface of airway epithelia represents a first barrier 
against pathogens. The chemical and physical properties of the airway surface 
fluid are controlled by the activity of ion channels and transporters. In cystic 
fibrosis (CF), loss of CFTR chloride channel function causes airway surface 
dehydration, bacterial infection, and inflammation. We investigated the effects 
of IL-17A plus TNF-α, 2 cytokines with relevant roles in CF and other chronic 
lung diseases. Transcriptome analysis revealed a profound change with 
upregulation of several genes involved in ion transport, antibacterial defense, 
and neutrophil recruitment. At the functional level, bronchial epithelia treated 
in vitro with the cytokine combination showed upregulation of ENaC channel, 
ATP12A proton pump, ADRB2 β-adrenergic receptor, and SLC26A4 anion exchanger. 
The overall result of IL-17A/TNF-α treatment was hyperviscosity of the airway 
surface, as demonstrated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) 
experiments. Importantly, stimulation with a β-adrenergic agonist switched 
airway surface to a low-viscosity state in non-CF but not in CF epithelia. Our 
study suggests that CF lung disease is sustained by a vicious cycle in which 
epithelia cannot exit from the hyperviscous state, thus perpetuating the 
proinflammatory airway surface condition.
