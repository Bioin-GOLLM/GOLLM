We describe a novel point mutation in the mitochondrial DNA transfer RNA 
methionine gene, a G-to-A transition at position 4450, in a patient with a 
splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes. The patient's lymphocytes were 
remarkable by the presence of large cytoplasmic inclusions demonstrated as 
abnormal mitochondria by electron microscopy and led to the discovery of the 
mutation using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis as a screening procedure. 
The pathogenic potential of the mutation was clearly established by the 
following criteria. It was absent in a control population. It involves a 
nucleotide that is highly conserved along the phylogenetic tree. The mutation 
was heteroplasmic and, when present in a high proportion, was associated with 
morphological alterations of the mitochondria, with defects of respiratory chain 
complexes activities and with a decrease in the mitochondrially encoded 
cytochrome c oxidase subunit II. Transfer of the mutation in Rho0 cells allowed 
to demonstrate its association with a severe respiratory chain dysfunction. 
However, although the pathogenicity of the mutation was clearly demonstrated, 
its link with the patient disease remained disputable.
