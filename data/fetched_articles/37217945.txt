BACKGROUND: S100A6 and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) are important 
cancer-related molecules. A previous study identified an interaction between 
S100A6 and MDM2 by size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance 
experiments. The present study investigated whether S100A6 could bind to MDM2 in 
vivo and further explored its functional implication.
METHODS: Co-immunoprecipitation, glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay, and 
immunofluorescence were performed to determine the in vivo interaction between 
S100A6 and MDM2. Cycloheximide pulse-chase assay and ubiquitination assay were 
performed to clarify the mechanism by which S100A6 downregulated MDM2. In 
addition, clonogenic assay, WST-1 assay, and flow cytometry of apoptosis and the 
cell cycle were performed and a xenograft model was established to evaluate the 
effects of the S100A6/MDM2 interaction on growth and paclitaxel-induced 
chemosensitivity of breast cancer. The expressions of S100A6 and MDM2 in 
patients with invasive breast cancer were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In 
addition, the correlation between the expression of S100A6 and the response to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy was statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: S100A6 promoted the MDM2 translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm, in 
which the S100A6 bound to the binding site of the herpesvirus-associated 
ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) in MDM2, disrupted the MDM2-HAUSP-DAXX 
interactions, and induced the MDM2 self-ubiquitination and degradation. 
Furthermore, the S100A6-mediated MDM2 degradation suppressed the growth of 
breast cancer and enhanced its sensitivity to paclitaxel both in vitro and in 
vivo. For patients with invasive breast cancer who received epirubicin and 
cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (EC-T), expressions of S100A6 and MDM2 
were negatively correlated, and high expression of S100A6 suggested a higher 
rate of pathologic complete response (pCR). Univariate and multivariate analyses 
showed that the high expression of S100A6 was an independent predictor of pCR.
CONCLUSION: These results reveal a novel function for S100A6 in downregulating 
MDM2, which directly enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy.
