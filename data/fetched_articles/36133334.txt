Nanopore technology has attracted extensive attention due to its rapid, highly 
sensitive, and label-free performance. In this study, we aimed to identify 
proteinogenic amino acids using a wild-type aerolysin nanopore. Specifically, 
bipolar peptide probes were synthesised by linking four aspartic acid residues 
to the N-terminal and five arginine residues to the C-terminal of individual 
amino acids. With the help of the bipolar peptide carrier, 9 proteinogenic amino 
acids were reliably recognised based on current blockade and dwell time using an 
aerolysin nanopore. Furthermore, by changing the charge of the peptide probe, 
two of the five unrecognized amino acids above mentioned were identified. These 
findings promoted the application of aerolysin nanopores in proteinogenic amino 
acid recognition.
