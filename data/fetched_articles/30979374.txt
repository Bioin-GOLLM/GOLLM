BACKGROUND: Tripartite motif 47 (TRIM47), a member of the TRIM family proteins, 
plays a key role in many types of cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). We 
found that levels of TRIM47 mRNA and protein were increased significantly in 
colorectal tumors compared with nontumor tissues and the increased levels were 
associated with advanced tumor stage and poor outcome.
METHODS: We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot to 
measure levels of TRIM47 mRNA and protein in human colorectal cancer and paired 
normal tissues. TRIM47 was knocked down and overexpressed in colorectal cancer 
cells, and the effects on cell proliferation, migration and growth of xenograft 
tumors in nude mice were assessed. The signaling pathways were examined by 
western blot and immunoprecipitation assays.
RESULTS: TRIM47 promoted CRC proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo 
as an oncogene. Mechanistically, TRIM47 interacted physically with SMAD4, 
increasing its ubiquitination and degradation. Loss of SMAD4 leaded to 
up-regulation of CCL15 expression and caused growth and invasion in human CRC 
cells through the CCL15-CCR1 signaling. Moreover, TRIM47 overexpression played a 
role in CRC chemoresistance in response to 5-FU therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a functional role of the TRIM47-SMAD4-CCL15 
axis in CRC progression and suggested a potential target for CRC therapy.
