BACKGRUOUND: The prevalence of young-onset diabetes (YOD) has been increasing 
worldwide. As the incidence of YOD increases, it is necessary to determine the 
characteristics of YOD and the factors that influence its development and 
associated complications.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we recruited patients who were diagnosed 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus between June 2001 and December 2021 at a tertiary 
hospital. The study population was categorized according to age: YOD (age <40 
years), middle-age-onset diabetes (MOD, 40≤ age <65 years), and late-onset 
diabetes (LOD, age ≥65 years). We examined trends in glycemic control by 
analyzing fasting glucose levels during the first year in each age group. A Cox 
proportional-hazards model was used to determine the relative risk of developing 
complications according to glycemic control trends.
RESULTS: The fasting glucose level at the time of diagnosis was highest in the 
YOD group (YOD 149±65 mg/dL; MOD 143±54 mg/dL; and LOD 140±55 mg/dL; p=0.009). 
In the YOD group, glucose levels decreased at 3 months, but increased by 12 
months. YOD patients and those with poor glycemic control in the first year were 
at a higher risk of developing complications, whereas the risk in patients with 
LOD was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: YOD patients had higher glucose levels at diagnosis, and their 
glycemic control was poorly maintained. As poor glycemic control can influence 
the development of complications, especially in young patients, intensive 
treatment is necessary for patients with YOD.
