In this study, in order to investigate the role of Ca2+ in GABA signal 
transduction involved in phenolics accumulation in barley seedlings under NaCl 
stress, the seedlings were treated with exogenous GABA and its synthesis 
inhibitor, 3-mercaplopropionic acid (3-MP), as well as Ca2+ channel blockers 
La3+, Ca2+ chelator EGTA, and Ca2+ release channel inhibitor 
2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). The results showed that GABA significantly 
enhanced phenolics, calcium and calmodulin content. It also induced Ca2+ influx 
in barley root tips cells, and altered the distribution of Ca2+, making calcium 
precipitates more uniform and intensive. While, 3-MP treatment led to opposite 
changes, which suggested that GABA was essential for calcium content increase. 
In addition, accumulation of phenolics was inhibited by LaCl3, EGTA and 2-APB 
treatments, and this inhibition could be alleviated partly by exogenous GABA. 
Taken together, Ca2+ was involved in GABA signal transduction for phenolics 
accumulation in barley seedlings under NaCl stress.
