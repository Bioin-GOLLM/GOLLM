The morphogenetically matured spermatozoa (sperm) are generated in the testes by 
the spermatogenesis. They travel male reproductive tract with many substances 
secreted from the accessory reproductive organs. One of the substances is the 
semenogelin (SEMG) released from the seminal vesicles that is involved in the 
post-testicular maturation. The expression of SEMG gene was investigated in 
seminal vesicle tissues of sexually matured and regressed male Syrian hamsters 
by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The SEMG gene was 
uniquely identified in the seminal vesicles of the matured Syrian hamsters and 
compared to the genes reported previously. But the expression of SEMG gene was 
not observed in reproductively and completely regressed testes of Syrian 
hamsters. These results indicate that the expressions of the SEMG gene are 
related to the reproductive capability in the male Syrian hamsters.
