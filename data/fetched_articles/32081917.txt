Carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) encodes a cholesterol ester hydrolase that is 
secreted into the duodenum as a component of pancreatic juice. The objective of 
this study was to characterize the CEL gene, investigate the association between 
the CEL promoter variants and chicken phenotypic traits, and explore the CEL 
gene regulatory mechanism. An insertion/deletion (indel) caused by a 99-bp 
insertion fragment was shown for the first time in the chicken CEL promoter, and 
large differences in allelic frequency were found among commercial breeds, 
indigenous and feral birds. Association analysis demonstrated that this indel 
site had significant effects on shank length, shank girth, chest breadth at 8 
weeks (p < 0.01), evisceration weight, sebum weight, breast muscle weight, and 
leg weight (p < 0.05). Tissue expression profiles showed extremely high levels 
of the CEL gene in pancreatic tissue. Moreover, the expression levels of the 
genes APOB, MTTP, APOV1 and SREBF1, which are involved in lipid transport, were 
significantly reduced by adding a 4% oxidized soybean oil diet treatment at the 
individual level and transfecting the embryonic primary hepatocytes with a 
CEL-overexpression vector. Interestingly, the results showed that the expression 
level of the II homozygous genotype was significantly higher than that of the ID 
and DD genotypes, while individuals with DD genotypes had higher phenotypic 
values. Therefore, these data suggested that the CEL gene might affect body 
growth by participating in hepatic lipoprotein metabolism and that the 99-bp 
indel polymorphism could be a potentially useful genetic marker for improving 
the economically important traits of chickens.
