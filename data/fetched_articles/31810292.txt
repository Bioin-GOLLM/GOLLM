BACKGROUND: Mutations in CALR observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) 
were recently shown to be pathogenic via their interaction with MPL and the 
subsequent activation of the Janus Kinase - Signal Transducer and Activator of 
Transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. However, little is known on the impact of 
those variant CALR proteins on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis.
METHODS: The impact of the expression of Wild Type (WT) or mutant CALR on ER 
homeostasis was assessed by quantifying the expression level of Unfolded Protein 
Response (UPR) target genes, splicing of X-box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1), and the 
expression level of endogenous lectins. Pharmacological and molecular (siRNA) 
screens were used to identify mechanisms involved in CALR mutant proteins 
degradation. Coimmunoprecipitations were performed to define more precisely 
actors involved in CALR proteins disposal.
RESULTS: We showed that the expression of CALR mutants alters neither ER 
homeostasis nor the sensitivity of hematopoietic cells towards ER stress-induced 
apoptosis. In contrast, the expression of CALR variants is generally low because 
of a combination of secretion and protein degradation mechanisms mostly mediated 
through the ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD)-proteasome pathway. Moreover, we 
identified a specific ERAD network involved in the degradation of CALR variants.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that this ERAD network could be considered as a 
potential therapeutic target for selectively inhibiting CALR mutant-dependent 
proliferation associated with MPN, and therefore attenuate the associated 
pathogenic outcomes.
