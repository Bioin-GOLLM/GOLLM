BACKGROUND: Aedes borne viral diseases, notably dengue, are increasingly 
reported in Cameroon with Aedes aegypti being a major vector. Data on 
insecticide resistance of this vector and underlying mechanisms needed for 
outbreak preparedness remain scarce in Cameroon. Here, we present the nationwide 
distribution of insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti and investigate the 
potential resistance mechanisms involved.
METHODS: Immature stages of Ae. aegypti were collected between March and July 
2017 in 13 locations across Cameroon and reared until G1/G2/G3 generation. 
Larval, adult bioassays, and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) synergist assays were 
carried out according to World Health Organization guidelines. F1534C mutation 
was genotyped using allele specific polymerase chain reaction in field collected 
adults (Go) and the polymorphism of the sodium channel gene was assessed. The χ2 
test was used to compare the mortality rate between bioassays with insecticides 
only and bioassays after preexposure to PBO synergist.
RESULTS: Larval bioassay revealed that all the three populations tested with 
temephos were susceptible. Adult bioassays showed a good level of susceptibility 
toward both pyrethroids tested, 0.25% permethrin and 0.05% deltamethrin, with 
six out of 10 populations susceptible. However, two populations (Douala and 
Edéa) were resistant (deltamethrin [73.2-92.5% mortality], permethrin [2.6-76.3% 
mortality]). The resistance to 4% dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was observed 
in four out of 10 populations tested (16.8-87.1% mortality). Resistance was also 
reported to carbamates including 0.1% propoxur (60.8-87.1% mortality) and to 
0.1% bendiocarb (82.9% mortality). All populations tested were fully susceptible 
to 1% fenitrothion. A partial recovery of susceptibility was observed in the 
pyrethroid resistant population of Douala after pre-exposed to PBO suggesting 
the implication of cytochrome P450 monoxygenases permethrin resistance. 
Genotyping and sequencing detected the F1534C kdr mutation in the two pyrethroid 
resistant locations of Edéa and Douala, with allelic frequency of 3.3% and 33.3% 
respectively. However, the high genetic diversity of the sodium channel gene 
supports the recent introduction of this mutation in Cameroon.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the contrasting resistance profiles to 
insecticides of Ae. aegypti populations in Cameroon suggesting that, instead of 
a unique nationwide control approach, a regionally adapted strategy will be 
needed to control this vector. The localised distribution of the F1534C kdr 
mutation supports this region-specific control strategy.
