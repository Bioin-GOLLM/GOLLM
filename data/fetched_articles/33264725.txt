To develop a disease model for the human Alström Syndrome (AS), we used the 
episomal reprogramming system and CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate an induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line with the compound heterozygous patient 
mutation (ALMS1 c.3902C > A, c.6436C > T) along with an isogenic gene-corrected 
control iPSC line. Both iPSC lines showed normal karyotype, expressed 
pluripotent markers, and differentiated into cells of three embryonic germ 
layer. These AS mutant and isogenic iPSC control line will be of great use in 
investigating the disease mechanisms, drug screening and treatment in patients.
