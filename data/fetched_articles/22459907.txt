INTRODUCTION: Clopidogrel inhibits ADP mediated platelet aggregation through 
inhibition of the P2Y12 receptor by its active metabolite. Thrombin induces 
platelet aggregation by binding to protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), and 
inhibition of PAR-1 has been evaluated in patients treated with clopidogrel to 
reduce ischemic events after acute coronary syndromes. Residual PAR-1 mediated 
platelet aggregation may be dependent on extent of clopidogrel response.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Platelet aggregation was measured in 55 patients 
undergoing elective PCI at 16-24 hours after 600 mg clopidogrel loading dose by 
light transmittance aggregometry using ADP 20 μM and thrombin receptor agonist 
peptide (TRAP) at 15 μM and 25 μM as agonists. Genomic DNA was genotyped for 
common CYP2C19 variants.
RESULTS: Increasing quartiles of 20 μM ADP induced platelet aggregation after 
clopidogrel loading were associated with increasing levels of TRAP mediated 
platelet aggregation. Patients in the highest quartile (clopidogrel 
non-responders) of post treatment ADP aggregation had significantly higher TRAP 
mediated aggregation than the patients in the lowest quartile (clopidogrel 
responders) [TRAP 15 μM: 79.6 ± 5% vs. 69.5 ± 8%, p<0.001].
CONCLUSIONS: Non-responders to clopidogrel show increased residual platelet 
aggregation induced by TRAP, whereas clopidogrel responders exhibit attenuated 
response to TRAP. Addition of PAR-1 antiplatelet drugs may be most effective in 
patients with reduced clopidogrel response and high residual TRAP mediated 
platelet aggregation.
