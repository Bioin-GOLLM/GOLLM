Enterococcus faecium is a commensal of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, but 
is also found in non-enteric environments where it can grow between 10 °C and 
45 °C. E. faecium has recently emerged as a multi-drug resistant nosocomial 
pathogen. We hypothesized that genes involved in the colonization and infection 
of mammals exhibit temperature-regulated expression control and we therefore 
performed a transcriptome analysis of the clinical isolate E. faecium E1162, 
during mid-exponential growth at 25 °C and 37 °C. One of the genes that 
exhibited differential expression between 25 °C and 37 °C, was predicted to 
encode a peptidoglycan-anchored surface protein. The N-terminal domain of this 
protein is unique to E. faecium and closely related enterococci, while the 
C-terminal domain is homologous to the Streptococcus agalactiae surface protein 
BibA. This region of the protein contains proline-rich repeats, leading us to 
name the protein PrpA for proline-rich protein A. We found that PrpA is a 
surface-exposed protein which is most abundant during exponential growth at 
37 °C in E. faecium E1162. The heterologously expressed and purified N-terminal 
domain of PrpA was able to bind to the extracellular matrix proteins fibrinogen 
and fibronectin. In addition, the N-terminal domain of PrpA interacted with both 
non-activated and activated platelets.
