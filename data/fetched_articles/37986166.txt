KEY POINTS: Proximal tubular TNF aggravates kidney injury and fibrogenesis in 
aristolochic acid nephropathy. Tubular TNF disrupts the cell cycle in injured 
tubular epithelial cells. TNF-mediated toxic renal injury is independent of 
systemic immune responses.
BACKGROUND: Aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) presents with tubular epithelial 
cell (TEC) damage and tubulointerstitial inflammation. Although TNF-α regulates 
cell apoptosis and inflammatory responses, the effects of tubular TNF in the 
progression of AAN require elucidation.
METHODS: Floxed TNF mice on the 129/SvEv background were crossed with PEPCK-Cre 
mice to generate PEPCK-Cre+TNFflox/flox (TNF PTKO) mice or bred with Ksp-Cre 
mice to generate KSP-Cre+TNFflox/flox (TNF DNKO) mice. TNF PTKO, TNF DNKO, and 
wild-type controls (Cre negative littermates) were subjected to acute and 
chronic AAN.
RESULTS: Deletion of TNF in the proximal but not distal nephron attenuated 
kidney injury, renal inflammation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis after acute 
or chronic aristolochic acid (AA) exposure. The TNF PTKO mice did not have 
altered numbers of infiltrating myeloid cells in AAN kidneys. Nevertheless, 
kidneys from AA-treated TNF PTKO mice had reduced levels of proteins involved in 
regulated cell death, higher proportions of TECs in the G0/G1 phase, and reduced 
TEC proportions in the G2/M phase. Pifithrin-α, which restores the cell cycle, 
abrogated differences between the wild-type and PTKO cohorts in G2/M phase 
arrest of TECs and kidney fibrosis after AA exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: TNF from the proximal but not the distal nephron propagates kidney 
injury and fibrogenesis in AAN in part by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest of 
TECs.
