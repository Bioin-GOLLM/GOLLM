Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a highly prevalent and 
intractable form of cardiac decompensation commonly associated with diastolic 
dysfunction. Here, we show that diastolic dysfunction in patients with HFpEF is 
associated with a cardiac deficit in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). 
Elevating NAD+ by oral supplementation of its precursor, nicotinamide, improved 
diastolic dysfunction induced by aging (in 2-year-old C57BL/6J mice), 
hypertension (in Dahl salt-sensitive rats), or cardiometabolic syndrome (in ZSF1 
obese rats). This effect was mediated partly through alleviated systemic 
comorbidities and enhanced myocardial bioenergetics. Simultaneously, 
nicotinamide directly improved cardiomyocyte passive stiffness and 
calcium-dependent active relaxation through increased deacetylation of titin and 
the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase 2a, respectively. In 
a long-term human cohort study, high dietary intake of naturally occurring NAD+ 
precursors was associated with lower blood pressure and reduced risk of cardiac 
mortality. Collectively, these results suggest NAD+ precursors, and especially 
nicotinamide, as potential therapeutic agents to treat diastolic dysfunction and 
HFpEF in humans.
