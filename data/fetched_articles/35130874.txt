BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia 49 (HSP49) is an autosomal recessive 
genetic disease first discovered in 2012; and which the mutation primarily 
affects Bukharian Jewish patients.
CASE PRESENTATION: The present case reports the first instance of HSP49 detected 
in China. The patient had normal mental development and good athletic ability 
before 10 years old and presented with instable temperature, mental retardation, 
spastic ataxia, and paroxysmal convulsions. Genetic diagnosis was based on 
detection of whole exons and two heterozygous variants in the exon region of the 
TECPR2 gene: c.1729C > T and c.4189G > A. Mutations at these two sites have not 
been previously reported.
CONCLUSIONS: This case expands the gene mutation spectrum and clinical 
phenotypic characteristics of autosomal recessive HSP in China; moreover, it 
indicates differences in the clinical phenotype of HSP49 in different 
ethnicities. In addition, this reported provides further evidence regarding the 
effectiveness of targeted next-generation sequencing technology in improving the 
efficiency and diagnostic rate of genetic diagnosis of HSP.
