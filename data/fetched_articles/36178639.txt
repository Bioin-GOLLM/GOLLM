Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to pathogenic 
variants of the galactosidase alpha (GLA) gene, leading to a deficiency of 
alpha-galactosidase A. The inadequate enzymatic activity leads to progressive 
glycosphingolipids accumulation within tissues and subsequent multi-systemic 
dysfunction, with predominant involvement of heart, kidney, and nervous system. 
Two subtypes are recognized: the classic type and the late-onset type. We here 
describe the clinical characteristics of a patient with late-onset Fabry disease 
carrying a not previously identified GLA gene variant. This 50-year-old man came 
to hospital because of an acute ischemic stroke. He also complained of 
acroparesthesia and had angiokeratomas in the nape and the back. Blood 
alpha-galactosidase A activity was low, plasmatic lyso-Gb3 level was borderline, 
cardiac MRI showed cardiac fibrosis, brain MRI documented cerebrovascular 
disease, and skin biopsy revealed small fiber neuropathy without 
globotriaosylceramide-3 skin deposits. Genetic study by means of targeted 
next-generation sequencing analysis disclosed a missense substitution c.1139C>T 
(p.Pro380Leu) in the GLA gene. We suggest that this novel variant should be 
considered as pathogenic and associated with a late-onset variant of Fabry 
disease with a predominant neurological phenotype.
