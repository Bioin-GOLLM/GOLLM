Folate and methionine metabolism plays an essential role in both DNA synthesis 
and methylation. Polymorphisms in the genes of the folate-dependent enzymes have 
been shown to affect disease susceptibility. We conducted a Korean 
population-based case-control study to evaluate whether genetic variation in 
folate metabolism may have a role in the risk of multiple myeloma (MM). The 
study subjects were 173 patients with MM and 1,700 population-based controls. 
The polymorphisms studied include methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 
677 C > T and 1298 A > C, methionine synthase (MS) 2756 A > G, methionine 
synthase reductase (MTRR) 66A > G, thymidylate synthase (TS) 28-bp repeat 
(2R-->3R) and 6-bp deletion/insertion. MS 2756 AG genotypes were associated with 
a 1.5-fold lower risk of MM (OR = 0.66, 95%CI; 0.43-0.99, P = 0.047). There was 
no association between MTHFR C677T, A1298C, MTRR A66G, TS 2R-->3R and 6-bp 
deletion/insertion polymorphisms and MM. These results suggest that MTHFR C677T, 
A1298C, MTRR A66G, TS 2R-->3R, and 6-bp deletion/insertion do not significantly 
factor into the pathogenesis of MM in the Korean population, but that MS A2756G 
polymorphism may play an important role.
