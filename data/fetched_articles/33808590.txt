RATIONALE: Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, leads to impaired pancreatic 
function and therefore reduced intestinal absorption of lipids and fat-soluble 
vitamins especially in patients with CF developing pancreatic insufficiency 
(PI). Previous studies showed that CFTR modulator therapy with 
lumacaftor-ivacaftor (LUM/IVA) in Phe508del-homozygous patients with CF results 
in improvement of pulmonary disease and thriving. However, the effects of 
LUM/IVA on plasma concentration of the lipid soluble vitamins A and E remain 
unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the course of plasma vitamin A and E in patients with 
CF under LUM/IVA therapy.
METHODS: Data from annual follow-up examinations of patients with CF were 
obtained to assess clinical outcomes including pulmonary function status, body 
mass index (BMI), and clinical chemistry as well as fat-soluble vitamins in 
Phe508del-homozygous CF patients before initiation and during LUM/IVA therapy.
RESULTS: Patients with CF receiving LUM/IVA improved substantially, including 
improvement in pulmonary inflammation, associated with a decrease in blood 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) from 9.4 to 8.2 g/L after two years (p < 0.001). During 
the same time, plasma vitamin A increased significantly from 1.2 to 1.6 µmol/L 
(p < 0.05), however, levels above the upper limit of normal were not detected in 
any of the patients. In contrast, plasma vitamin E as vitamin E/cholesterol 
ratio decreased moderately over the same time from 6.2 to 5.5 µmol/L (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: CFTR modulator therapy with LUM/IVA alters concentrations of 
vitamins A and vitamin E in plasma. The increase of vitamin A must be monitored 
critically to avoid hypervitaminosis A in patients with CF.
