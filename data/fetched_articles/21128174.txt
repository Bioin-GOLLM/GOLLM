Nucleoside triphosphates having a 3'-ONH₂ blocking group have been prepared with 
and without fluorescent tags on their nucleobases. DNA polymerases were 
identified that accepted these, adding a single nucleotide to the 3'-end of a 
primer in a template-directed extension reaction that then stops. Nitrite 
chemistry was developed to cleave the 3'-ONH₂ group under mild conditions to 
allow continued primer extension. Extension-cleavage-extension cycles in 
solution were demonstrated with untagged nucleotides and mixtures of tagged and 
untagged nucleotides. Multiple extension-cleavage-extension cycles were 
demonstrated on an Intelligent Bio-Systems Sequencer, showing the potential of 
the 3'-ONH₂ blocking group in "next generation sequencing."
