The observed increased incidence of colorectal cancer in Ashkenazi Jews compared 
to other populations is unexplained but likely has a genetic component. The 
I1307K APC polymorphism/mutation is carried by 6-8% of Ashkenazim and increases 
the risk of colorectal cancer 1.5-2 fold. There are few differences between the 
phenotype of colorectal cancer in I1307K carriers and sporadic cases. It is 
estimated that the mutation accounts for 6% of cases of colorectal cancer in 
Jews of Eastern European heritage. It should not be the subject of mass 
screening in Ashkenazi Jews, although it may be important in cases of familial 
colorectal cancer. Even rarer is the 1906G-->C MSH2 mutation carried by less 
than 1% of Ashkenazim, but as with other HNPCC mutations likely associated with 
a high risk of malignancy. Mutations at 15q13-14 are associated with the 
colorectal adenoma and carcinoma syndrome (CRAC) described in Ashkenazi 
families. The prevalence of the mutation is not known, nor its significance as a 
cause of colorectal cancer. Despite the paucity of genetic explanations for the 
high risk of colorectal cancer in Ashkenazim, that risk warrants aggressive 
colorectal cancer screening and particular attention to family history of 
malignancy in all Jews of Ashkenazi descent.
