OBJECTIVE: Citalopram (CITA) is a widely used and well-tolerated selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The aim of the study was to evaluate the possible 
influences of serum concentrations of CITA and its major metabolite 
n-desmethylcitalopram (NDCITA) on the efficacy and tolerability of CITA in 
patients with major depressive disorder.
METHODS: The study included 46 outpatients with major depressive disorder who 
received CITA. The efficacy and tolerability were assessed for 6 weeks. Serum 
CITA and NDCITA levels were measured at the 4th week.
RESULTS: The HDRS17 total scores of the patients with high NDCITA and CITA & 
NDCITA concentrations showed a more significant reduction compared to the 
patients with expected and low serum NDCITA and CITA & NDCITA concentrations. 
However, we did not observe a correlation between the serum concentrations and 
the side effects of CITA, NDCITA, and CITA & NDCITA.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested the potential contribution of NDCITA to the 
antidepressant effect of CITA. Further studies involving larger clinical samples 
are required to confirm the impact of serum NDCITA concentrations on the 
efficacy of CITA.
