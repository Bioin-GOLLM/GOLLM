Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are the major proton receptor in the brain and 
a key mediator of acidosis-induced neuronal injuries in disease. Most of 
published data on ASIC function came from studies performed in mice, and 
relatively little is known about potential differences between human and mouse 
ASICs (hASIC and mASIC, respectively). This information is critical for us to 
better interpret the functional importance of ASICs in human disease. Here, we 
examined the expression of ASICs in acutely resected human cortical tissue. 
Compared with mouse cortex, human cortical tissue showed a similar ratio of 
ASIC1a:ASIC2a expression, had reduced ASIC2b level, and exhibited a higher 
membrane:total ratio of ASIC1a. We further investigated the mechanism for higher 
surface trafficking of hASIC1a in heterologous cells. A single amino acid at 
position 285 was critical for increased N-glycosylation and surface expression 
of hASIC1a. Consistent with the changes in trafficking and current, cells 
expressing hASIC1a or mASIC1a S285P mutant had a higher acid-activated calcium 
increase and exhibited worsened acidotoxicity. These data suggest that ASICs are 
likely to have a larger impact on acidosis-induced neuronal injuries in humans 
than mice, and this effect is, at least in part, a result of more efficient 
trafficking of hASIC1a.-Xu, Y., Jiang, Y.-Q., Li, C., He, M., Rusyniak, W. G.,
