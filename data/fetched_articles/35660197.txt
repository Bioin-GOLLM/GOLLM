BACKGROUND: The impact of a postoperative diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients 
undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains unknown. The objective of this 
study is to characterize the effect of COVID-19 infection following TJA on 
perioperative complication rates.
METHODS: The Mariner database was queried for patients undergoing total hip and 
total knee arthroplasty from January 2018 to April 2020. TJA patients who were 
diagnosed with COVID-19 within 90 days postoperatively were matched in a 1:3 
fashion based on age, gender, iron deficiency anemia, payer status, and Charlson 
Comorbidity Index with patients who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. 
Preoperative comorbidity profiles and complications within 3 months of surgery 
were compared. Statistical analysis included chi-squared tests and multivariate 
logistic regression with outcomes considered significant at P < .05.
RESULTS: Of the 239 COVID-19 positive patients, 132 (55.2%) underwent total hip 
arthroplasty. On multivariate analysis, COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with 
increased odds of deep vein thrombosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.86, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 2.10-11.81, P < .001), pulmonary embolism (OR 6.27, 95% CI 
2.57-16.71, P < .001), and all complications (OR 3.36, 95% CI 2.47-4.59, P < 
.001). Incidence of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism was greater the 
closer in time the COVID-19 diagnosis was to the surgical procedure (10.24 times 
at 1 month, 7.87 times at 2 months, and 1.42 times at 3 months; P < .001). A 
similar relationship was observed with all complications.
CONCLUSION: Postoperative COVID-19 infection is associated with higher rates of 
cardiopulmonary complications, thromboembolic disease, renal injury, and urinary 
tract infections in patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty. COVID-19 
infection earlier in the postoperative period is associated with a higher risk 
of complications.
