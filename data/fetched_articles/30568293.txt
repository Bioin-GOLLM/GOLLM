Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is one of the most common pathologies associated 
with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). The pharmacological targets remain obscured, 
as the molecular mechanisms underlying FCD are unclear. Implications of 
epigenetically modulated aberrant gene expression in disease progression are 
reported in various DRE pathologies except FCD. Here we performed genome-wide 
CpG-DNA methylation profiling by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) 
microarray and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on cortical tissues resected from FCD 
type II patients. A total of 19088 sites showed altered DNA methylation in all 
the CpG islands. Of these, 5725 sites were present in the promoter regions, of 
which 176 genes showed an inverse correlation between methylation and gene 
expression. Many of these 176 genes were found to belong to a cohesive network 
of physically interacting proteins linked to several cellular functions. Pathway 
analysis revealed significant enrichment of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), 
EGFR, PDGFRA, NTRK3, and mTOR signalling pathways. This is the first study that 
investigates the epigenetic signature associated with FCD type II pathology. The 
candidate genes and pathways identified in this study may play a crucial role in 
the regulation of the pathogenic mechanisms of epileptogenesis associated with 
FCD type II pathologies.
