Soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP) is a promising biomarker for malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (MPM), but several confounding factors can reduce 
SMRP-based test's accuracy. The identification of these confounders could 
improve the diagnostic performance of SMRP. In this study, we evaluated the 
sequence of 1,000 base pairs encompassing the minimal promoter region of the 
MSLN gene to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that can affect 
SMRP. We assessed the association between four MSLN promoter variants and SMRP 
levels in a cohort of 72 MPM and 677 non-MPM subjects, and we carried out in 
vitro assays to investigate their functional role. Our results show that 
rs2235503 is an eQTL for MSLN associated with increased levels of SMRP in 
non-MPM subjects. Furthermore, we show that this polymorphic site affects the 
accuracy of SMRP, highlighting the importance of evaluating the individual's 
genetic background and giving novel insights to refine SMRP specificity as a 
diagnostic biomarker.
