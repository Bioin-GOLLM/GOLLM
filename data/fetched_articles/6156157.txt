Immunochemistry of cytochrome c. Identification of antigenic determinants 
through the study of hybrid molecules.

Berman PW, Harbury HA.

Antibodies elicited in rabbits against horse cytochrome c cross-react in varying 
degree with the cytochromes c of other species. Radioimmunoassay experiments are 
described in which 23% of the immunoglobulin shown to bind to horse cytochrome c 
fails to react with beef cytochrome c, and 14% of that bound by beef cytochrome 
c does not react with rabbit cytochrome c. Studies of hybrid cytochromes, 
prepared by a reconstitution procedure involving the cleavage and re-formation 
of peptide bond 65-66, show that these differences result from single amino acid 
replacements, Beef cytochrome c differs in binding capacity from horse 
cytochrome c as a result of the substitution of a glycine for a lysine residue 
in sequence position 60, and the difference between rabbit cytochrome c and beef 
cytochrome c reflects the substitution of a valine for a proline residue in 
position 44. Reconstituted horse cytochrome c and reconstituted beef cytochrome 
c have binding capacities indistinguishable from those of the parent proteins. 
The presence of a homoserine rather than a methionine residue in position 65 
results, in the case of the reconstituted horse molecule, in a slightly lower 
affinity for the antibody population directed against the lysine-60 region. A 
corresponding difference is not observed in the case of beef cytochrome c and 
its reconstitution product, which do not bind the population in question.
