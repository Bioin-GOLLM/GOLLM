Guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences can adopt noncanonical four-stranded 
secondary structures called guanine (G)-quadruplexes. Bioinformatics analysis 
suggests that G-quadruplex motifs are prevalent in genomes, which raises the 
need to elucidate their function. There is now evidence for the existence of DNA 
G-quadruplexes at telomeres with associated biological function. A recent 
hypothesis supports the notion that gene promoter elements contain DNA 
G-quadruplex motifs that control gene expression at the transcriptional level. 
We discovered a highly conserved, thermodynamically stable RNA G-quadruplex in 
the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the gene transcript of the human NRAS 
proto-oncogene. Using a cell-free translation system coupled to a reporter gene 
assay, we have demonstrated that this NRAS RNA G-quadruplex modulates 
translation. This is the first example of translational repression by an RNA 
G-quadruplex. Bioinformatics analysis has revealed 2,922 other 5' UTR RNA 
G-quadruplex elements in the human genome. We propose that RNA G-quadruplexes in 
the 5' UTR modulate gene expression at the translational level.
