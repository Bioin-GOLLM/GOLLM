CONTEXT: Familial isolated hypoparathyroidism (FIH) is a genetically 
heterogeneous disorder due to mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), 
glial cells missing-2 (GCM2), guanine nucleotide binding protein α11 (GNA11), or 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) genes. Thus far, only four cases with homozygous and 
two cases with heterozygous mutations in the PTH gene have been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To clinically describe an FIH family and identify and characterize 
the causal gene mutation.
DESIGN: Genomic DNA of the family members was subjected to CASR, GCM2, GNA11, 
and PTH gene mutational analysis. Functional assays were performed on the 
variant identified.
PARTICIPANTS: Six subjects of a three-generation FIH family with three affected 
individuals having severe hypocalcemia and inappropriately low serum PTH.
RESULTS: No mutations were detected in the CASR, GCM2, and GNA11 genes. A 
heterozygous variant that segregated with the disease was identified in PTH gene 
exon 2 (c.41T>A; p.M14K). This missense variant, in the hydrophobic core of the 
signal sequence, was predicted in silico to impair cleavage of preproPTH to 
proPTH. Functional assays in HEK293 cells demonstrated much greater retention 
intracellularly but impaired secretion into the medium of the M14K mutant 
relative to wild type. The addition of the pharmacological chaperone, 
4-phenylbutyric acid, led to a reduction of cellular retention and increased 
accumulation in the cell medium of the M14K mutant.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a heterozygous PTH mutation in an FIH family and 
demonstrate accumulation of the mutant intracellularly and its impaired 
secretion. An accurate genetic diagnosis in such hypoparathyroid patients is 
critical for appropriate treatment and genetic counseling.
