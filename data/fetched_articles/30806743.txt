Depression is a common comorbidity in cancer cases, but this is not only due to 
the emotional distress of having a life-threatening disease. A common biological 
mechanism, involving a dysregulated immune system, seems to underpin this 
comorbidity. In particular, the activation of the kynurenine pathway of 
tryptophan degradation due to inflammation may play a key role in the 
development and persistence of both diseases. As a consequence, targeting 
enzymes involved in this pathway offers a unique opportunity to develop new 
strategies to treat cancer and depression at once. In this work, we provide a 
systematic review of the evidence up to date on the kynurenine pathway role in 
linking depression and cancer and on clinical implications of this evidence. In 
particular, complications due to chemotherapy are discussed, as well as the 
potential antidepressant efficacy of novel immunotherapies for cancer.
