BACKGROUND: von Willebrand factor (VWF) variant c.2771G>A; p.R924Q has been 
described as a benign polymorphism or a possible marker for a null allele and 
been associated with mild bleeding phenotypes. It was identified in several 
patients in recent type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD) studies.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the p.R924Q allele contributes to reduced VWF 
levels and type 1 VWD.
METHODS: One thousand one hundred and fifteen healthy controls and 148 index 
cases from the MCMDM-1VWD study were genotyped for c.2771G>A; VWF and FVIII 
levels were analyzed in ABO blood group stratified individuals and the p.R924Q 
variant was expressed in 293 EBNA cells.
RESULTS: c.2771G>A was present in six index cases, five of whom had a second VWF 
variant which probably contributed to the phenotype. A common core haplotype 
identified in families, which included the rare G allele of c.5843-8C>G, was 
present in the majority of 35 c.2771G>A heterozygous controls. c.2771G>A 
contributed about 10% variance in VWF and FVIII levels in controls and 35% 
variance when co-inherited with blood group O. Recombinant p.R924Q VWF had no 
effect on in vitro expression and heterozygous family members had normal 
VWF-FVIII binding and normal clearance of VWF and FVIII.
CONCLUSIONS: The allele bearing c.2771A leads to reductions in VWF and FVIII 
levels particularly in combination with blood group O. Its inheritance alone may 
be insufficient for VWD diagnosis, but it appears to be associated with a 
further VWF level reduction in individuals with a second VWF mutation and it 
contributes to population variance in VWF and FVIII levels.
