Immunologic pathways involved in sarcoidosis pathogenesis are largely unknown. 
We hypothesized that patients with sarcoidosis have characteristic mRNA 
profiles. Microarray analysis of gene expression was done on peripheral blood 
(12 patients, 12 controls), lung (6 patients, 6 controls) and lymph node (8 
patients, 5 controls). Comparing peripheral blood from patients with sarcoidosis 
to controls, 872 transcripts were upregulated and 1039 were downregulated at 
>1.5-fold change and a significant q value. Several transcripts associated with 
interferon and STAT1 were upregulated. Lung and lymph node analyses also showed 
dramatic increases in STAT1 and STAT1-regulated chemokines. Granulomas in lymph 
nodes of patients with sarcoidosis expressed abundant STAT1 and phosphorylated 
STAT1. STAT1 might play an important role in sarcoidosis. This novel hypothesis 
unites seemingly disparate observations with regard to sarcoidosis including 
implication of a casual role for interferons, a suspected infectious trigger, 
T(H)1 predominating lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage, and the association 
with hypercalcemia.
