BACKGROUND: Human heart failure is associated with decreased cardiac 
voltage-gated Na+ channel current (encoded by SCN5A), and the changes have been 
implicated in the increased risk of sudden death in heart failure. Nevertheless, 
the mechanism of SCN5A downregulation is unclear. A number of human diseases are 
associated with alternative mRNA splicing, which has received comparatively 
little attention in the study of cardiac disease. Splicing factor expression 
profiles during human heart failure and a specific splicing pathway for SCN5A 
regulation were explored in this study.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Gene array comparisons between normal human and heart 
failure tissues demonstrated that 17 splicing factors, associated with all major 
spliceosome components, were upregulated. Two of these splicing factors, RBM25 
and LUC7L3, were elevated in human heart failure tissue and mediated truncation 
of SCN5A mRNA in both Jurkat cells and human embryonic stem cell-derived 
cardiomyocytes. RBM25/LUC7L3-mediated abnormal SCN5A mRNA splicing reduced Na+ 
channel current 91.1Â±9.3% to a range known to cause sudden death. Overexpression 
of either splicing factor resulted in an increase in truncated mRNA and a 
concomitant decrease in the full-length SCN5A transcript.
CONCLUSIONS: Of the 17 mRNA splicing factors upregulated in heart failure, RBM25 
and LUC7L3 were sufficient to explain the increase in truncated forms and the 
reduction in full-length Na+ channel transcript. Because the reduction in 
channels was in the range known to be associated with sudden death, interruption 
of this abnormal mRNA processing may reduce arrhythmic risk in heart failure.
