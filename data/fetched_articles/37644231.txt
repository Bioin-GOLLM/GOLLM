The CCT/TRiC chaperonin is found in the cytosol of all eukaryotic cells and 
assists protein folding in an ATP-dependent manner. The heterozygous double 
mutation T400P and R516H in subunit CCT2 is known to cause Leber congenital 
amaurosis (LCA), a hereditary congenital retinopathy. This double mutation also 
renders the function of subunit CCT2, when it is outside of the CCT/TRiC 
complex, to be defective in promoting autophagy. Here, we show using 
steady-state and transient kinetic analysis that the corresponding double 
mutation in subunit CCT2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduces the off-rate of 
ADP during ATP hydrolysis by CCT/TRiC. We also report that the ATPase activity 
of CCT/TRiC is stimulated by a non-folded substrate. Our results suggest that 
the closed state of CCT/TRiC is stabilized by the double mutation owing to the 
slower off-rate of ADP, thereby impeding the exit of CCT2 from the complex that 
is required for its function in autophagy.
