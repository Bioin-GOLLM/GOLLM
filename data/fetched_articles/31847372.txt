Nucleic acid-based adjuvants have recently emerged as promising candidates for 
use in cancer vaccines to induce tumor-suppressing immune cells. In this study, 
we tested whether complexation of a nucleic acid-based adjuvant with chitosan 
(CTS) modulates immune adjuvant functions. As a nucleic acid-based adjuvant, we 
used toll-like receptor 3-recognizing RNA adjuvant (RA). Negatively charged RA 
formed nanoscale polyplexes with cationic CTS that possessed positive zeta 
potentials. RA/CTS polyplexes exerted dendritic cell (DC)-maturation effects 
without causing significant DC toxicity. This DC-maturation effect was CTS 
molecular weight dependent, with RA/CTS polyplexes with a CTS molecular weight 
of 340 kDa (RA/CTS 340K) producing the greatest effect. Subcutaneous injection 
of RA/CTS 340K polyplexes with the model tumor antigen ovalbumin exerted a 
preventive effect against challenge by ovalbumin-expressing tumor cells. It also 
provided greater inhibitory effects against a second challenge with the same 
tumor cells compared with other treatments. These protective effects of 
subcutaneous RA/CTS polyplex treatment were associated with the highest tumor 
antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses after tumor challenge, 
and with the greatest infiltration of CD4 helper T cell and CD8 T cell into the 
tumor tissues. Mice vaccinated with ovalbumin and RA/CTS polyplexes showed 
complete survival, even after repeated challenge with tumor cells. Our results 
suggest the potential of RA/CTS polyplexes as effective nanoadjuvants in the 
design of tumor vaccines and cancer immunotherapy.
