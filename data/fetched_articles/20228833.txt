Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is an important virulence factor of the highly 
pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus. A five-amino-acid (5 aa) deletion at 
position 80-84 and an aspartic acid to glutamic acid substitution at position 92 
(D92E) are two major NS1 mutations that are highly correlated with enhanced 
virulence. To investigate the effect of these mutations in H5N1 virulence, three 
H5N1-NS1 variants were constructed: NS51 (lacking 5 aa at position 80-84), 
NS51(I) (carrying a 5-aa insertion at position 80-84) and NS51(IM) (carrying 
both the 5-aa insertion and the D92E mutation). We examined the effects of these 
mutations on interferon (IFN) induction, tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)alpha 
response, p53 activity and apoptosis. We found that the D92E mutation eliminated 
NS1's repressive effect on IFN induction, while the 5-aa deletion resulted in 
enhanced resistance to TNFalpha responses. We also observed that all three 
variants exhibited a similar suppressive effect on p53 transcriptional activity, 
although none of them significantly influenced apoptosis of host cells. Our 
findings shed new light on the role of NS1 in the pathogenicity of H5N1 virus.
