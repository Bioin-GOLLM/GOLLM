Alport syndrome is a mainly X-linked hereditary disease of basement membranes 
characterized by progressive renal failure, deafness, and ocular lesions. The 
alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV) collagen genes have been recently shown to be 
involved in the less frequent autosomal recessive form. When screening 
lymphocyte COL4A3 mRNAs from Alport patients, we found a mutant whose 
transcripts were disrupted by a 74 bp insertion at the junction of exons IV or V 
and VI. The insertion derives from an antisense Alu element in COL4A3 intron V, 
which has been spliced into the alpha 3(IV) mRNA due to a G to T transversion 
activating a cryptic acceptor splice site in this Alu element. There is complete 
segregation of this mutation with the disease in the family. Our findings 
provide the first evidence for the pathogenic role of abnormal splicing of 
COL4A3. Moreover, we demonstrate the superiority of mutation screening at the 
mRNA level to detect a hitherto poorly recognized mutation mechanism in humans, 
splice-mediated insertion of an Alu fragment into a coding sequence.
