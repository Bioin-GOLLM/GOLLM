Aging and neurodegenerative disease are characterized by genomic instability in 
neurons, including aberrant activation and mobilization of transposable elements 
(TEs). Integrating studies of human postmortem brain tissue and Drosophila 
melanogaster models, we investigate TE activation in association with Tau 
pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Leveraging RNA sequencing from 636 human 
brains, we discover differential expression for several retrotransposons in 
association with neurofibrillary tangle burden and highlight evidence for global 
TE transcriptional activation among the long interspersed nuclear element 1 and 
endogenous retrovirus clades. In addition, we detect Tau-associated, active 
chromatin signatures at multiple HERV-Fc1 genomic loci. To determine whether Tau 
is sufficient to induce TE activation, we profile retrotransposons in Drosophila 
expressing human wild-type or mutant Tau throughout the brain. We discover 
heterogeneous response profiles, including both age- and genotype-dependent 
activation of TE expression by Tau. Our results implicate TE activation and 
associated genomic instability in Tau-mediated AD mechanisms.
