In nervous systems, retrograde signals are key for organizing circuit activity 
and maintaining neuronal homeostasis. We identify the conserved Allnighter (Aln) 
pseudokinase as a cell non-autonomous regulator of proteostasis responses 
necessary for normal sleep and structural plasticity of Drosophila 
photoreceptors. In aln mutants exposed to extended ambient light, proteostasis 
is dysregulated and photoreceptors develop striking, but reversible, 
dysmorphology. The aln gene is widely expressed in different neurons, but not 
photoreceptors. However, secreted Aln protein is retrogradely endocytosed by 
photoreceptors. Inhibition of photoreceptor synaptic release reduces Aln levels 
in lamina neurons, consistent with secreted Aln acting in a feedback loop. In 
addition, aln mutants exhibit reduced night time sleep, providing a molecular 
link between dysregulated proteostasis and sleep, two characteristics of ageing 
and neurodegenerative diseases.
