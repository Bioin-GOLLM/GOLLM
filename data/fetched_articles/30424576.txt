Several different approaches are used to describe the role of protein 
compartments and residues in catalysis and to identify key residues suitable for 
the modification of the activity or selectivity of the desired enzyme. In our 
research, we applied a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and a water 
tracking approach to describe the water accessible volume of Solanum tuberosum 
epoxide hydrolase. Using water as a molecular probe, we were able to identify 
small cavities linked with the active site: (i) one made up of conserved amino 
acids and indispensable for the proper positioning of catalytic water and (ii) 
two others in which modification can potentially contribute to enzyme 
selectivity and activity. Additionally, we identified regions suitable for de 
novo tunnel design that could also modify the catalytic properties of the 
enzyme. The identified hot-spots extend the list of the previously targeted 
residues used for modification of the regioselectivity of the enzyme. Finally, 
we have provided an example of a simple and elegant process for the detailed 
description of the network of cavities and tunnels, which can be used in the 
planning of enzyme modifications and can be easily adapted to the study of any 
other protein.
