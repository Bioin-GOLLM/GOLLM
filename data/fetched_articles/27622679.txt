It is difficult to detect visual function deficits in patients at risk for 
glaucoma (glaucoma suspects) and at early disease stages with conventional 
ophthalmic tests such as perimetry. To this end, we introduce a novel quadrant 
field measure of the melanopsin retinal ganglion cell mediated pupil light 
response corresponding with typical glaucomatous arcuate visual field defects. 
The melanopsin-mediated post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) was measured in 
46 patients with different stages of glaucoma including glaucoma suspects and 
compared to a healthy group of 21 participants with no disease. We demonstrate 
that the superonasal quadrant PIPR differentiated glaucoma suspects and early 
glaucoma patients from controls with fair (AUC = 0.74) and excellent 
(AUC = 0.94) diagnostic accuracy, respectively. The superonasal PIPR provides a 
linear functional correlate of structural retinal nerve fibre thinning in 
glaucoma suspects and early glaucoma patients. This first report that quadrant 
PIPR stimulation detects melanopsin dysfunction in patients with early glaucoma 
and at pre-perimetric stages may have future implications in treatment decisions 
of glaucoma suspects.
