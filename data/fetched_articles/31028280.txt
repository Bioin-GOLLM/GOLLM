OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the role of genetics in the respiratory 
response of asthmatic children to air pollution, with a genome-wide level 
analysis of gene by nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) interaction 
on lung function and to identify biological pathways involved.
METHODS: We used a two-step method for fast linear mixed model computations for 
genome-wide association studies, exploring whether variants modify the 
longitudinal relationship between 4-month average pollution and 
post-bronchodilator FEV1 in 522 Caucasian and 88 African-American asthmatic 
children. Top hits were confirmed with classic linear mixed-effect models. We 
used the improved gene set enrichment analysis for GWAS (i-GSEA4GWAS) to 
identify plausible pathways.
RESULTS: Two SNPs near the EPHA3 (rs13090972 and rs958144) and one in TXNDC8 
(rs7041938) showed significant interactions with NO2 in Caucasians but we did 
not replicate this locus in African-Americans. SNP-CO interactions did not reach 
genome-wide significance. The i-GSEA4GWAS showed a pathway linked to the HO-1/CO 
system to be associated with CO-related FEV1 changes. For NO2-related FEV1 
responses, we identified pathways involved in cellular adhesion, oxidative 
stress, inflammation, and metabolic responses.
CONCLUSION: The host lung function response to long-term exposure to pollution 
is linked to genes involved in cellular adhesion, oxidative stress, 
inflammatory, and metabolic pathways.
