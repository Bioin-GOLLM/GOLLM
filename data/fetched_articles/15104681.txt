Anew human leucocyte antigen-B (HLA-B) allele, B*3927, was detected in three 
individuals of a Caucasian family by routine typing with sequence-specific 
primers (SSP). Serological typing showed B27 Bw4 and B39 Bw6, whereas SSP 
detected only B*27 as well as the Bw4 and Bw6 motif. The sequence of exons 1-5 
of the new allele was determined by allele-specific amplification and 
sequencing. The new B*39 allele showed one nucleotide difference with B*390101 
at position 299 in exon 2. Codon 100 changed from GAG to GTG, resulting in an 
amino acid substitution from glutamic acid to valine at position 76 of the 
mature protein. The haplotype carrying the B*3927 allele was A*010101, B*3927, 
Cw*120301, DRB1*0101 and DQB1*050101.
