The cytoprotective effects of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) require 
interactions between an as of a yet undefined region with a distinct ectodomain 
on the PEDF receptor (PEDF-R). Here we characterized the area in PEDF that 
interacts with PEDF-R to promote photoreceptor survival. Molecular docking 
studies suggested that the ligand binding site of PEDF-R interacts with the 
neurotrophic region of PEDF (44-mer, positions 78-121). Binding assays 
demonstrated that PEDF-R bound the 44-mer peptide. Moreover, peptide P1 from the 
PEDF-R ectodomain had affinity for the 44-mer and a shorter fragment within it, 
17-mer (positions 98-114). Single residue substitutions to alanine along the 
17-mer sequence were designed and tested for binding and biological activity. 
Altered 17-mer[R99A] did not bind to the P1 peptide, whereas 17-mer[H105A] had 
higher affinity than the unmodified 17-mer. Peptides 17-mer, 17-mer[H105A], and 
44-mer exhibited cytoprotective effects in cultured retina R28 cells. 
Intravitreal injections of these peptides and PEDF in the rd1 mouse model of 
retinal degeneration decreased the numbers of dying photoreceptors, 
17-mer[H105A] being most effective. The blocking peptide P1 hindered their 
protective effects both in retina cells and in vivo. Thus, in addition to 
demonstrating that the region composed of positions 98-114 of PEDF contains 
critical residues for PEDF-R interaction that mediates survival effects, the 
findings reveal distinct small PEDF fragments with neurotrophic effects on 
photoreceptors.
