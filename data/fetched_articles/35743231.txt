Cyclic nucleotide-gated channel β 1 (CNGB1) encodes a subunit of the rod cyclic 
nucleotide-gated channel. Pathogenic variants in CNGB1 are responsible for 4% of 
autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Several treatment strategies show 
promise for treating inherited retinal degenerations, however relevant metrics 
of progression and sensitive clinical trial endpoints are needed to assess 
therapeutic efficacy. This study reports the natural history of CNGB1-related RP 
with a longitudinal phenotypic analysis of 33 molecularly-confirmed patients 
with a mean follow-up period of 4.5 ± 3.9 years (range 0-17). The mean best 
corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the right eye was 0.31 ± 0.43 logMAR at 
baseline and 0.47 ± 0.63 logMAR at the final visit over the study period. The 
ellipsoid zone (EZ) length was measurable in at least one eye of 23 patients and 
had a mean rate of constriction of 178 ± 161 µm per year (range 1.0-661 µm), 
with 57% of patients having a decrease in EZ length of greater than 250 µm in a 
simulated two-year trial period. Hyperautofluorescent outer ring (hyperAF) area 
was measurable in 17 patients, with 10 patients not displaying a ring phenotype. 
The results support previous findings of CNGB1-related RP being a slowly 
progressive disease with patients maintaining visual acuity. Prospective deep 
phenotyping studies assessing multimodal retinal imaging and functional measures 
are now required to determine clinical endpoints to be used in a trial.
