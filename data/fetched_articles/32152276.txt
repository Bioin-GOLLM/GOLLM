Endophilins-A are conserved endocytic adaptors with membrane curvature-sensing 
and -inducing properties. We show here that, independently of their role in 
endocytosis, endophilin-A1 and endophilin-A2 regulate exocytosis of 
neurosecretory vesicles. The number and distribution of neurosecretory vesicles 
were not changed in chromaffin cells lacking endophilin-A, yet fast capacitance 
and amperometry measurements revealed reduced exocytosis, smaller vesicle pools 
and altered fusion kinetics. The levels and distributions of the main exocytic 
and endocytic factors were unchanged, and slow compensatory endocytosis was not 
robustly affected. Endophilin-A's role in exocytosis is mediated through its 
SH3-domain, specifically via a direct interaction with intersectin-1, a 
coordinator of exocytic and endocytic traffic. Endophilin-A not able to bind 
intersectin-1, and intersectin-1 not able to bind endophilin-A, resulted in 
similar exocytic defects in chromaffin cells. Altogether, we report that two 
endocytic proteins, endophilin-A and intersectin-1, are enriched on 
neurosecretory vesicles and regulate exocytosis by coordinating neurosecretory 
vesicle priming and fusion.
