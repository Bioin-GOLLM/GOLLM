It is of interest to design and develop efficient inhibitors to the TNIK protein 
target in Wnt signaling pathways in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC) using 
molecular docking models. We show data to support that a compound named 
aglafoline (methyl 
(1R,2R,3S,3aR,8bS)-1,8b-dihydroxy-6,8-dimethoxy-3a-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H 
cyclopenta [b] [1] from the NPACT (Naturally Occurring Plant-based Anti-cancer 
Compound-Activity-Target database) database have optimal binding features with 
the TNIK receptor for further consideration in this context.
