BACKGROUND: Ticagrelor and clopidogrel, P2Y12 receptor antagonists, can prevent 
thrombotic events and are used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as acute 
coronary syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in which 
inflammation is involved. Moreover, NF-B is the central regulator of 
inflammation. Thus, we suspected that ticagrelor and clopidogrel are involved in 
the regulation of the NF-ΚB signaling pathway.
METHODS: After human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured 
with ticagrelor or clopidogrel and given lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CD14, the 
mRNA levels of related inflammatory factors, the protein level and subcellular 
localization of molecules in the NF-ΚB signaling pathway, cell viability, 
apoptosis and the cell cycle, cell migration, and vascular formation were 
detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blotting 
and immunofluorescence assay, CCK-8, flow cytometry, transwell assay, and 
matrigel, respectively. All data was expressed as the mean ± S.D. The 
statistical significance of data was assessed by an unpaired two-tailed t-test.
RESULTS: Ticagrelor and clopidogrel can inhibit the degradation of IKBα and 
phosphorylation of p65, prevent p65 from entering the nucleus, reduce the 
production of TNFα, IL-1, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-2, and alleviate the decrease in 
cell viability, cell migration and angiogenesis, the changes of cell cycle and 
apoptosis induced by LPS.
CONCLUSIONS: Ticagrelor and clopidogrel alleviate cellular dysfunction through 
suppressing NF-ΚB signaling pathway.
