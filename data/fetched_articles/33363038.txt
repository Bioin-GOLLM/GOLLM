The prognosis of patients with relapsed/refractory NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is 
dismal. Immunotherapy has showed encouraging anti-tumor activity in patients 
with asparaginase-resistant NKTCL; however, only a portion of patients benefit 
and the median response duration is rather short. Treatment strategies have not 
been identified for immunotherapy-resistant NKTCL. We describe a patient with 
primary cutaneous NKTCL experienced disease progression after pegaspargase-based 
chemotherapy and PD-1 inhibitor (sintilimab)-based immunotherapy. Following a 
combined treatment of sintilimab and the HDAC inhibitor chidamide, the patient 
achieved a durable complete molecular response with mild toxicity. This case 
indicates that the combination of PD-1 inhibitor and HDAC inhibitor might be a 
treatment choice for immunotherapy-resistant NKTCL.
