We studied polymorphisms in the genes for monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 
(MCP-1) and CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 in 171 Parkinson's disease (PD) 
patients and 340 controls. Although no associations were found in alleles or 
genotypes, MCP-1 -2518A/G genotype affected the age-at-onset of PD patients. 
This effect was also detected in a second PD group, suggesting a possible 
involvement of MCP-1 in PD.
