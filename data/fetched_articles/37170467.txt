The use of an effective antimalarial drug is the cornerstone of malaria control. 
However, the development and spread of resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains 
have placed the global eradication of malaria in serious jeopardy. Molecular 
marker analysis constitutes the hallmark of the monitoring of Plasmodium 
drug-resistance. This study included 96 P. falciparum PCR-positive samples from 
southern Somalia. The P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene had 
high frequencies of K76T, A220S, Q271E, N326S, and R371I point mutations. The 
N86Y and Y184F mutant alleles of the P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene 
were present in 84.7 and 62.4% of the isolates, respectively. No mutation was 
found in the P. falciparum Kelch-13 gene. This study revealed that chloroquine 
resistance markers are present at high frequencies, while the parasite remains 
sensitive to artemisinin (ART). The continuous monitoring of ART-resistant 
markers and in vitro susceptibility testing are strongly recommended to track 
resistant strains in real time.
