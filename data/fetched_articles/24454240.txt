In the title mol-ecule, C19H20O6, the conformation about the C=C bond of the 
central enone group is E. The dihedral angle formed by the benzene rings is 
11.6 (2)°. The hy-droxy group is involved in an intra-molecular O-H⋯O hydrogen 
bond. In the crystal, weak C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds link the mol-ecules into chains 
along [010].
