Evidence for a relationship between omega-6/omega-3 (n-6/n-3) polyunsaturated 
fatty acid (PUFA) ratio and obesity in humans is inconsistent, perhaps due to 
differences in dietary intake or metabolism of PUFAs between different subsets 
of the population. Since chronic inflammation is central to obesity and 
inflammatory pathways are regulated by PUFAs, the objective of this study was to 
examine whether variants in the NFKB1 gene, an upstream regulator of the 
inflammatory response, modify the association between the n-6/n-3 ratio (from 
diet and plasma) and anthropometric traits in a multiethnic/multiracial 
population of young adults. Participants' (n = 898) dietary PUFA intake was 
assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and plasma PUFA concentrations by 
gas chromatography. Nine tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in NFKB1 were 
genotyped. Significant interactions were found between racial/ethnic groups and 
plasma n-6/n-3 ratio for body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.02) and waist 
circumference (WC) (p = 0.007). Significant interactions were also observed 
between racial/ethnic groups and three NFKB1 genotypes (rs11722146, rs1609798, 
and rs230511) for BMI and WC (all p ≤ 0.04). Significant interactions were found 
between two NFKB1 genotypes and plasma n-6/n-3 ratio for BMI and WC (rs4648090 p 
= 0.02 and 0.03; rs4648022 p = 0.06 and 0.04, respectively). Our findings 
suggest that anthropometric traits may be influenced by a unique combination of 
n-6/n-3 ratio, racial/ethnic background, and NFKB1 genotypes.
