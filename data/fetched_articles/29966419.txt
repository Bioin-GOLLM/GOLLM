Phosphate groups are essential components of nucleic acids and proteins, whose 
interactions with solvent, metal ions, and ionic side chains help control 
folding and binding. Methyl phosphate (MP) represents a simple analog of 
phosphate moieties that are post-translation modifications in proteins and 
present at the termini of nucleic acids, among other environments. In the 
present study, we optimized parameters for use in polarizable molecular dynamics 
simulations of MP in its mono- and dianionic forms, MP- ≡ CH3HPO4- and MP2- ≡ 
CH3PO42-, along with P i2- ≡ HPO42-, in the context of the classical Drude 
oscillator model. Parameter optimization was done in a manner consistent with 
the remainder of the Drude molecular mechanics force field, choosing atomic 
charges and polarizabilities to reproduce molecular properties from quantum 
mechanics as well as experimental hydration free energies. Optimized parameters 
were similar to existing dimethyl phosphate parameters, with a few significant 
differences. The developed parameters were then used to compute magnesium 
binding affinities in aqueous solution, using alchemical molecular dynamics free 
energy simulations. Good agreement with experiment was obtained, and outer 
sphere binding was shown to be predominant for MP- and MP2-.
