Skeletal muscle tissue has the important function of supporting and defending 
the organism. It is the largest apparatus in the human body, and its function is 
important for contraction and movements. In addition, it is involved in the 
regulation of protein synthesis and degradation. In fact, inhibition of protein 
synthesis and/or activation of catabolism determines a pathological condition 
called muscle atrophy. Muscle atrophy is a reduction in muscle mass resulting in 
a partial or complete loss of function. It has been established that many 
physiopathological conditions can cause a reduction in muscle mass. 
Nevertheless, it is not well known the molecular mechanisms and signaling 
processes causing this dramatic event. There are multiple concomitant processes 
involved in muscle atrophy. In fact, the gene transcription of some factors, 
oxidative stress mechanisms, and the alteration of ion transport through 
specific ion channels may contribute to muscle function impairment. In this 
review, we focused on the molecular mechanisms responsible for muscle damage and 
potential drugs to be used to alleviate this disabling condition.
