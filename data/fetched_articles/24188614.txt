The widely used pseudorabies virus (PRV) Bartha-K61 vaccine has played a key 
role in the eradication of PRV. Since late 2011, however, a disease 
characterized by neurologic symptoms and a high number of deaths among newborn 
piglets has occurred among Bartha-K61-vaccinated pigs on many farms in China. 
Clinical samples from pigs on 15 farms in 6 provinces were examined. The PRV gE 
gene was detectable by PCR in all samples, and sequence analysis of the gE gene 
showed that all isolates belonged to a relatively independent cluster and 
contained 2 amino acid insertions. A PRV (named HeN1) was isolated and caused 
transitional fever in pigs. In protection assays, Bartha-K61 vaccine provided 
100% protection against lethal challenge with SC (a classical PRV) but only 50% 
protection against 4 challenges with strain HeN1. The findings suggest that 
Bartha-K61 vaccine does not provide effective protection against PRV HeN1 
infection.
