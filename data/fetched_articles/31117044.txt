Management of Central Nervous System Tumors.

Kaley T, Nabors LB.

Meningiomas represent a full spectrum of tumors that are the most common type of 
brain tumor in adults. Although most are benign, recent research has shown that 
the recurrence rate is high, especially for WHO grades 2 and 3, and overall 
survival is poor for these grades. Treatment is evolving, and recently sunitinib 
and bevacizumab have shown promise compared with historical treatments. However, 
more research is needed to identify better treatments for meningiomas. Treatment 
of brain metastases is another evolving field. Studies suggest that stereotactic 
radiosurgery is preferable to whole-brain radiation therapy and that immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and therapies targeted to the T790M mutation and ALK can 
improve outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and brain 
metastases.
