Noonan syndrome is characterized by typical craniofacial dysmorphism, postnatal 
growth retardation, congenital heart defect, and learning difficulties and 
belongs to the RASopathies, a group of neurodevelopmental disorders caused by 
germline mutations in genes encoding components of the RAS-MAPK pathway. 
Mutations in the RAF1 gene are associated with Noonan syndrome, with a high 
prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). RAF1 mutations cluster in exons 
encoding the conserved region 2 (CR2), the kinase activation segment of the CR3 
domain, and the C-terminus. We present two boys with Noonan syndrome and the 
identical de novo RAF1 missense variant c.1082G>C/p.(Gly361Ala) affecting the 
CR3, but located outside the kinase activation segment. The p.(Gly361Ala) 
mutation has been identified as a RAF1 allele conferring resistance to RAF 
inhibitors. This amino acid change favors a RAF1 conformation that allows for 
enhanced RAF dimerization and increased intrinsic kinase activity. Both patients 
with Noonan syndrome showed typical craniofacial dysmorphism, macrocephaly, and 
short stature. One individual developed HCM and was diagnosed with a 
disseminated oligodendroglial-like leptomeningeal tumor (DOLT) of childhood at 
the age of 9 years. While there is a well-established association of NS with 
malignant tumors, especially childhood hemato-oncological diseases, brain tumors 
have rarely been reported in Noonan syndrome. Our data demonstrate that mutation 
scanning of the entire coding region of genes associated with Noonan syndrome is 
mandatory not to miss rare variants located outside the known mutational 
hotspots.
