Autophagy is an essential cellular process affecting virus infections and other 
diseases and Beclin1 (BECN1) is one of its key regulators. Here, we identified 
S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as E3 ligase that executes 
lysine-48-linked poly-ubiquitination of BECN1, thus promoting its proteasomal 
degradation. SKP2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation in a hetero-complex 
involving FKBP51, PHLPP, AKT1, and BECN1. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition 
of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances 
autophagic flux. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 
multiplication results in reduced BECN1 levels and blocks the fusion of 
autophagosomes and lysosomes. Inhibitors of SKP2 not only enhance autophagy but 
also reduce the replication of MERS-CoV up to 28,000-fold. The SKP2-BECN1 link 
constitutes a promising target for host-directed antiviral drugs and possibly 
other autophagy-sensitive conditions.
