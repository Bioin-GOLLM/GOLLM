The scope of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling can be 
expanded by assimilation of the mechanistic models of intracellular processes 
from systems biology field. The genome scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) 
represent a whole set of metabolic enzymes expressed in human tissues. Dynamic 
models of the gene regulation of key drug metabolism enzymes are available. 
Here, we introduce GSMNs and review ongoing work on integration of PBPK, GSMNs, 
and metabolic gene regulation. We demonstrate example models.
