The olfactory sense detects a plethora of behaviorally relevant odor molecules; 
gene families involved in olfaction exhibit high diversity in different animal 
phyla. Insects detect volatile molecules using olfactory (OR) or ionotropic 
receptors (IR) and in some cases gustatory receptors (GRs). While IRs are 
expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia, ORs have been hypothesized to 
be an adaptation to a terrestrial insect lifestyle. We investigated the 
olfactory system of the primary wingless bristletail Lepismachilis y-signata 
(Archaeognatha), the firebrat Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma) and the neopteran 
leaf insect Phyllium siccifolium (Phasmatodea). ORs and the olfactory coreceptor 
(Orco) are with very high probability lacking in Lepismachilis; in Thermobia we 
have identified three Orco candidates, and in Phyllium a fully developed 
OR/Orco-based system. We suggest that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to a 
terrestrial lifestyle, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco being 
present before the appearance of ORs. DOI:
