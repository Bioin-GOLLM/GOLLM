BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) shows high metastasis and low survival. RNA 
modification writers play critical roles in tumor development. This study 
examined the clinical significance of RNA modification writers in GC prognosis 
based on four types of adenosine modifications (m1A, m6A, APA and A-to-I).
RESULTS: Writers demonstrated high mutation and expression in GC patients. 
Different expressions of 26 RNA modification writers were differentially 
associated with GC prognosis. High-WM score group appeared worse overall 
survival, higher immune infiltration and activation of EMT pathways than low-WM 
score group. WM score was correlated with both miRNAs-targeted signaling 
pathways and patients' sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and efficacy of 
immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study further revealed the close association between 
adenosine-related RNA modifications and progression of GC. A cross talk between 
EMT and RNA modification was identified to be one of the mechanisms underlying 
GC development. Our WM scoring system could serve as a clinical indicator for 
predicting GC prognosis. Importantly, the WM score could guide personalized 
treatments such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy for GC patients.
