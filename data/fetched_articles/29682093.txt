BACKGROUND: Primary Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial disease in which 
genetic factors are strongly associated with its development; however, recently 
it has been observed that epigenetic modifications are also involved in the 
pathogenesis of OA. DNA methylation is related to gene silencing, and several 
studies have investigated its role in the loci of different pathways or 
molecules associated to OA.
OBJECTIVE: This review is focused on the current status of DNA methylation 
studies related to OA pathogenesis.
METHOD: A review of the literature was conducted on searching in PUBMED for 
original papers on DNA methylation in OA.
CONCLUSION: The DNA methylation research of loci related to OA pathogenesis has 
shown a correlation between methylation and gene repression; however, there are 
some exceptions to this rule. Recently, the development of genome-wide 
methylation and genome-wide hydroxymethylation profiles has demonstrated that 
several genes previously associated with OA can have changes in their 
methylation status, favoring the development of the disease, and these have even 
shown the role of other epigenetic markers.
