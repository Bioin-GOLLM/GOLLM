Evidence from family history, twin studies and molecular studies of rare 
inherited arrhythmia predisposition syndromes indicate that genetic factors are 
important contributors to determining risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). More 
recent evidence indicates that common genetic variants in several genes can 
explain part of this risk at the population level. Here, the genetic risks for 
SCD are reviewed along with explanations of basic concepts relevant to 
understanding genetic contributions to common diseases. Also reviewed are two 
categories of genetic studies that have led to important discoveries about the 
genetic basis for SCD in general populations. Candidate gene studies focusing 
mainly on genes responsible for rare inherited arrhythmia susceptibility 
syndromes or on determinants of autonomic nervous system function will be 
highlighted first followed by more recent data from genome wide association 
studies that have identified previously unrecognized genomic intervals that 
explain inter-individual differences in QT interval duration possibly accounting 
for a proportion of the population-attributable risk for SCD.
