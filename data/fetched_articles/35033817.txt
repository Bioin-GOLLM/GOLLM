The significance of B-RAF in the promotion of cell proliferation and motility 
was explored by the researchers in the past. However, in 2002, several 
researchers found that mutation in B-RAF leads to cancer. Extensive research on 
B-RAF mutations suggested B-RAF V600E mutation as a critical predictive, 
prognostic and diagnostic biomarker in numerous cancers such as melanoma, 
thyroid, and colorectal cancers. Based on the significance of B-RAF kinase and 
associated mutation, the present review will give a brief overview about 
structure and functions of B-RAF enzyme, its role in different types of cancer, 
available drugs in the market for B-RAF inhibition, chemical classification and 
SAR studies of reported investigational B-RAF inhibitors in patented and 
non-patented literature during last decade. The SAR provided for all the 
reported inhibitors will help researchers to gain knowledge about the possible 
structural features required for selective B-RAF inhibition. This insightful 
analysis of B-RAF will certainly help researchers to develop novel anticancer 
agents in the future.
