Rpn13/Adrm1 is recruited to the proteasome by PSMD1/Rpn2, where it serves as a 
substrate receptor that binds preferentially to K48-linked ubiquitin chains, an 
established signal for protein proteolysis. Here, we use NMR to solve the 
structure of hRpn13 Pru:hRpn2 (940-953):K48-diubiquitin. Surprisingly, 
hRpn2-bound hRpn13 selects a dynamic, extended conformation of K48-diubiquitin 
that is unique from previously determined structures. NMR experiments on free 
K48-diubiquitin demonstrate the presence of the reported "closed" conformation 
observed by crystallography, but also this more extended state, in which the 
hRpn13-binding surface is exposed. This extended K48-diubiquitin conformation is 
defined by interactions between L73 from G76-linked (distal) ubiquitin and a 
Y59-centered surface of K48-linked (proximal) ubiquitin. Furthermore, hRpn13 
exchanges between the two ubiquitins within 100Â ms, although prefers the 
proximal ubiquitin due to interactions with the K48 linker region. Altogether, 
these data lead to a revised model of how ubiquitinated substrates interact with 
the proteasome.
