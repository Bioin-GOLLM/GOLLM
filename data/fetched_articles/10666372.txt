The cerebellar medulloblastoma (WHO Grade IV) is a highly malignant, invasive 
embryonal tumor with preferential manifestation in children. Several molecular 
alterations appear to be involved, including isochromosome 17q and the p53, 
PTCH, and beta-catenin gene mutations. In this study, 46 sporadic 
medulloblastomas were screened for the presence of mutations in genes of the Wnt 
signaling pathway (APC and beta-catenin). Single-strand conformational 
polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by direct DNA sequencing revealed 3 
miscoding APC mutations in 2 (4.3%) medulloblastomas. One case contained a 
GCA-->GTA mutation at codon 1296 (Ala-->Val), and another case had double point 
mutations at codons 1472 (GTA-->ATA, Val-->Ile) and 1495 (AGT-->GGT, Ser-->Gly). 
Miscoding beta-catenin mutations were detected in 4 tumors (8.7%). Three of 
these were located at codon 33 (TCT -->TTT, Ser-->Phe) and another at codon 37 
(TCT-->GCT, Ser-->Ala). Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and beta-catenin 
mutations were mutually exclusive and occurred in a total of 6 of 46 cases 
(13%). Although germline APC mutations are a well established cause of familial 
colon and brain tumors (Turcot syndrome), this study provides the first evidence 
that APC mutations are also operative in a subset of sporadic medulloblastomas.
