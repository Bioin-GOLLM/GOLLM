We have ablated the cellular RNA degradation machinery in differentiated B cells 
and pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by conditional mutagenesis of core 
(Exosc3) and nuclear RNase (Exosc10) components of RNA exosome and identified a 
vast number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) with 
emergent functionality. Unexpectedly, eRNA-expressing regions accumulate R-loop 
structures upon RNA exosome ablation, thus demonstrating the role of RNA exosome 
in resolving deleterious DNA/RNA hybrids arising from active enhancers. We have 
uncovered a distal divergent eRNA-expressing element (lncRNA-CSR) engaged in 
long-range DNA interactions and regulating IgH 3' regulatory region 
super-enhancer function. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ablation of lncRNA-CSR 
transcription decreases its chromosomal looping-mediated association with the 
IgH 3' regulatory region super-enhancer and leads to decreased class switch 
recombination efficiency. We propose that the RNA exosome protects divergently 
transcribed lncRNA expressing enhancers by resolving deleterious 
transcription-coupled secondary DNA structures, while also regulating long-range 
super-enhancer chromosomal interactions important for cellular function.
