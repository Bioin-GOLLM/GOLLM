Patients with mutated TP53 have been identified as having comparatively poor 
outcomes compared to those retaining wild-type p53 in many cancers, including 
squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN). We have examined the role 
of p53 in regulation of metabolism in SCCHN cells and find that loss of p53 
function determines the Warburg effect in these cells. Moreover, this metabolic 
adaptation to loss of p53 function creates an Achilles' heel for tumour cells 
that can be exploited for potential therapeutic benefit. Specifically, cells 
lacking normal wild-type p53 function, whether through mutation or RNAi-mediated 
downregulation, display a lack of metabolic flexibility, becoming more dependent 
on glycolysis and losing the ability to increase energy production from 
oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, cells that have compromised p53 function can be 
sensitised to ionizing radiation by pre-treatment with a glycolytic inhibitor. 
These results demonstrate the deterministic role of p53 in regulating energy 
metabolism and provide proof of principle evidence for an opportunity for 
patient stratification based on p53 status that can be exploited therapeutically 
using current standard of care treatment with ionising radiation.
