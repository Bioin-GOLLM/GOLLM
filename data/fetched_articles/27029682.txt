OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine the association between beta-2 
adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene polymorphism (rs1042713, c.46A>G, p.Arg16Gly) 
and the response to inhaled salbutamol in North Indian children aged 5 to 15 
years, with mild to moderate exacerbation of asthma.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done at a tertiary-care hospital in 
Northern India from June 2011 to May 2013. 120 children with asthma with mild to 
moderate exacerbation underwent spirometry at baseline and after administration 
of three doses of salbutamol. An increase in FEV1 =15% was considered as 
positive response. Blood samples from these children were analysed for ADRB2 
polymorphism (p.Arg16Gly). 94 non-asthmatic adult controls were also studied to 
determine the prevalence of ADRB2 polymorphism.
RESULTS: In asthmatic children, the frequency of AA, GG, AG genotypes were 
24.2%, 24.2% and 51.7% compared to 20.2%, 20.2% and 59.6%, respectively in the 
non-asthmatic adults. Salbutamol responsiveness showed no correlation with the 
studied ADRB2 polymorphism (p= 0.55). A trend towards greater bronchodilator 
responsiveness amongst AA genotype, compared to GG genotype was observed (Median 
change in percent predicted FEV1 14.5% and 7.5%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: No correlation was found between salbutamol responsiveness and ADRB2 
genotype in Northern Indian children with asthma with mild-to moderate 
exacerbation.
