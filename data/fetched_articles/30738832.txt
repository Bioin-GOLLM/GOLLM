BACKGROUND: We and others have shown that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4) 
expression is increased in obesity/atherosclerosis and is positively correlated 
with atherosclerotic burden. However, the mechanism by which DPP4 expression is 
regulated in obesity remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the 
pathways regulating the expression of DPP4 on macrophages.
METHODS: Flowsight® Imaging Flow Cytometry was employed for the detection of 
DPP4 and immunophenotyping. DPP4 enzymatic activity was measured by a DPPIV-Glo™ 
Protease Assay kit.
FINDINGS: Human monocytes expressed a moderate level of membrane-bound DPP4. 
Obese patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 had a higher level of monocyte 
DPP4 expression, in parallel with higher levels of HOMA-IR, blood glucose, 
triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol, compared to those in the non-obese 
(BMI < 30) patients. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), but not native 
LDL, up-regulated DPP4 expression on macrophages with a preferential increase in 
CD36+ cells. OxLDL mediated DPP4 up-regulation was considerably diminished by 
Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) knockdown and CD36 deficiency. TRIF deficiency, but 
not MyD88 deficiency, attenuated oxLDL-induced DPP4 increase.
INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests a key role for oxLDL and downstream 
CD36/TLR4/TRIF in regulating DPP4 expression. Increased DPP4 in response to 
oxidized lipids may represent an integrated mechanism linking post-prandial 
glucose metabolism to lipoprotein abnormality-potentiated atherosclerosis.
