Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is the pathway for removal of peripheral 
tissue cholesterol and involves transport of cholesterol back to liver for 
excretion, starting from cellular cholesterol efflux facilitated by lipid-free 
apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) or other lipidated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
particles within the interstitial space. Extracellular cholesterol then is 
picked up and transported through the lymphatic vasculature before entering into 
bloodstream. There is increasing evidence supporting a role for enhanced 
macrophage cholesterol efflux and RCT in ameliorating atherosclerosis, and 
recent data suggest that these processes may serve as better diagnostic 
biomarkers than plasma HDL levels. Hence, it is important to better understand 
the processes governing ApoA1 and HDL influx into peripheral tissues from the 
bloodstream, modification and facilitation of cellular cholesterol removal 
within the interstitial space, and transport through the lymphatic vasculature. 
New findings will complement therapeutic strategies for the treatment of 
atherosclerotic vascular disease.
