DNA vaccines might offer an alternative to the live smallpox vaccine in 
providing protective efficacy in an orthopoxvirus (OPV) lethal respiratory 
challenge model. BALB/c mice were immunised with DNA vaccines coding for 10 
different single vaccinia virus (VACV) membrane proteins. After an intranasal 
challenge with the VACV IHD strain, three gene candidates B5R, A33R and A27L 
produced > or =66% survival. The B5R DNA vaccine consistently produced 100% 
protection and exhibited greatest efficacy after three 50 microg intramuscular 
doses in this model. Sero-conversion to these vaccines was often inconsistent, 
implying that antibody itself was not a correlate of protection. The B5R DNA 
vaccine induced a strong and consistent gamma interferon (IFNgamma) response in 
BALB/c mice given a single DNA vaccine dose. Strong IFNgamma responses were also 
measured in pTB5R immunised C57BL6 mice deficient for MHC class I molecules, 
suggesting that the memory response was mediated by a CD4+ T cell population.
