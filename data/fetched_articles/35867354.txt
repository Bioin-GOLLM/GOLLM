INTRODUCTION: To determine the role of vitamin D intake on cognitive decline 
among Blacks and Whites.
METHODS: Using data from the population-based Chicago Health and Aging Project, 
we studied 2061 Blacks and 1329 Whites with dietary vitamin D data and cognitive 
testing over 12 years of follow-up. Multivariable linear mixed-effects models 
were used to determine the association of vitamin D intake with cognitive 
decline.
RESULTS: Vitamin D intake, particularly dietary vitamin D, was associated with a 
slower rate of decline in cognitive function among Blacks. In Blacks, comparing 
individuals in the lowest tertile of dietary intake, those in the highest 
tertile had a slower cognitive decline of 0.017 units/year (95% confidence 
interval 0.006, 0.027), independently of supplementation use. In Whites, vitamin 
D intake was not associated with cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION: Dietary vitamin D may help to slow the decline in cognitive 
abilities among Blacks as they age.
