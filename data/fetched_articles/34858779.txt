BACKGROUND: Developing liquid biopsy technology with higher sensitivity and 
specificity especially for low-frequency mutations remains crucial. This study 
demonstrated superior performance of the newly developed digital PCR (dPCR) kit 
for ctDNA-based EGFR p.T790M detection in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) against ARMS-PCR.
METHODS: This large-scale, multi-centered diagnostic study recruited 1,045 
patients including 1,029 patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC and 16 patients 
with specific samples between April 1st 2018 and November 30th 2019. EGFR 
p.T790M in plasma samples from mNSCLC patients were tested using dPCR with 
ADx-ARMS PCR and CobasÂ® EGFR Mutation Test V2 as comparator assays to confirm 
cut-off value for dPCR and evaluate its performance against ARMS-PCR-based 
assays. Efficacy was evaluated for patients with EGFR p.T790M detected by dPCR 
or ARMS-PCR, who underwent Osimertinib treatment.
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and concordance of dPCR against ADx-ARMS 
PCR was 98.15%, 88.66% and 90.16%, respectively for 1,026 plasma samples. 
Additional 9.26% patients were detected positive by dPCR. The majority of those 
samples had a mutation allele frequency between 0.1% and 1%. In 45 paired tissue 
and plasma samples, the sensitivity improved from 30.77% to 53.85% by dPCR with 
the specificity over 90%. The response of Osimertinib in 74 EGFR 
p.T790M-positive patients detected by dPCR, including 26 determined as negative 
by ARMS-PCR, were evaluated to have an ORR of 44.59% and a DCR of 90.54%.
CONCLUSIONS: dPCR is a sensitive and accurate tool for ctDNA-based EGFR p.T790M 
detection due to its significantly improved sensitivity without compromising 
specificity, and dPCR is equivalent to ARMS-PCR as a companion diagnostic tool 
while benefiting more patients under Osimertinib treatment.
