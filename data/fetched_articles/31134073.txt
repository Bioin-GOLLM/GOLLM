Metastatic melanoma is the most aggressive and obstinate skin cancer with poor 
prognosis. Variant novel applicable regimens have emerged during the past 
decades intensively, while the most profound approaches are oncogene-targeted 
therapy and T-lymphocyte mediated immunotherapy. Although targeted therapies 
generated remarkable and rapid clinical responses in the majority of patients, 
acquired resistance was developed promptly within months leading to tumor 
relapse. By contrast, immunotherapies elicited long-term tumor regression. 
However, the overall response rate was limited. In view of the above, either 
targeted therapy or immunotherapy cannot elicit durable clinical responses in 
large range of patients. Interestingly, the advantages and limitations of these 
regimens happened to be complementary. An increasing number of preclinical 
studies and clinical trials proved a synergistic antitumor effect with the 
combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, implying a promising prospect 
for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. In order to achieve a better 
therapeutic effectiveness and reduce toxicity in patients, great efforts need to 
be made to illuminate multifaceted interplay between targeted therapy and 
immunotherapy.
