BACKGROUND: A great deal of evidence has supported that growth differentiation 
factor 5 (GDF5) is associated with the occurrence of knee osteoarthritis (KOA), 
while their results are not consistent. In the present study, we aimed to 
explore the association between GDF5 gene polymorphism and KOA for a more 
credible conclusion.
METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches were carried out in English 
databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science (WOS), and Cochrane, and 
Chinese databases, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), 
WANFANG, and VIP database. After the data were extracted from the required 
studies, the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
determined to assess the correlation between GDF5 gene polymorphism and KOA. The 
publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot.
RESULTS: According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 studies on the 
correlation between GDF5 gene polymorphism and KOA occurrence were eligible for 
meta-analysis. Among these articles, four studies showed no apparent 
correlation, while the other 11 studies indicated an obvious correlation. 
Meanwhile, we also carried out a subgroup analysis of the population. Due to the 
inevitable heterogeneity, three genetic models were finally selected for 
analysis. With the allele model (C versus T: OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.73~0.87), 
recessive model (CC versus CT + TT: OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.68~0.86), and 
homozygous model (CC versus TT: OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.58~0.76), GDF5 gene 
polymorphism decreased the risk of KOA. Besides, a significant association was 
observed in Caucasians, Asians, and Africans. Meanwhile, the protective effect 
of genotype C (or CC) in the Asian group was little obvious than that in the 
Caucasian group and the African group. Although the quality of the included 
studies was above medium-quality, we obtained results with a low level of 
evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the meta-analysis showed that the genotype C (or CC) 
of GDF5 protected against KOA occurrence in Caucasian, Asian, and African 
populations.
