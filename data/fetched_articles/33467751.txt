S100 proteins assume a diversity of oligomeric states including large order 
self-assemblies, with an impact on protein structure and function. Previous work 
has uncovered that S100 proteins, including S100B, are prone to undergo 
β-aggregation under destabilizing conditions. This propensity is encoded in 
aggregation-prone regions (APR) mainly located in segments at the homodimer 
interface, and which are therefore mostly shielded from the solvent and from 
deleterious interactions, under native conditions. As in other systems, this 
characteristic may be used to develop peptides with pharmacological potential 
that selectively induce the aggregation of S100B through homotypic interactions 
with its APRs, resulting in functional inhibition through a loss of function. 
Here we report initial studies towards this goal. We applied the TANGO algorithm 
to identify specific APR segments in S100B helix IV and used this information to 
design and synthesize S100B-derived APR peptides. We then combined fluorescence 
spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, biolayer interferometry, and 
aggregation kinetics and determined that the synthetic peptides have strong 
aggregation propensity, interact with S100B, and may promote co-aggregation 
reactions. In this framework, we discuss the considerable potential of such 
APR-derived peptides to act pharmacologically over S100B in numerous 
physiological and pathological conditions, for instance as modifiers of the 
S100B interactome or as promoters of S100B inactivation by selective 
aggregation.
