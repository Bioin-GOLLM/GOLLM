The emergence of acquired resistance against targeted drugs remains a major 
clinical challenge in lung adenocarcinoma patients. In a subgroup of these 
patients we identified an association between selection of EGFRT790M-negative 
but EGFRG724S-positive subclones and osimertinib resistance. We demonstrate that 
EGFRG724S limits the activity of third-generation EGFR inhibitors both in vitro 
and in vivo. Structural analyses and computational modeling indicate that 
EGFRG724S mutations may induce a conformation of the glycine-rich loop, which is 
incompatible with the binding of third-generation TKIs. Systematic inhibitor 
screening and in-depth kinetic profiling validate these findings and show that 
second-generation EGFR inhibitors retain kinase affinity and overcome 
EGFRG724S-mediated resistance. In the case of afatinib this profile translates 
into a robust reduction of colony formation and tumor growth of EGFRG724S-driven 
cells. Our data provide a mechanistic basis for the osimertinib-induced 
selection of EGFRG724S-mutant clones and a rationale to treat these patients 
with clinically approved second-generation EGFR inhibitors.
