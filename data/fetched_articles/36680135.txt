Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) replicate in the respiratory/oral mucosa, mimic 
natural infection, and can induce mucosal and systemic immune responses to the 
full repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 structural/nonstructural proteins. Generally, LAVs 
produce broader and more durable protection than current COVID-19 vaccines. We 
generated a temperature-sensitive (TS) SARS-CoV-2 mutant TS11 via 
cold-adaptation of the WA1 strain in Vero E6 cells. TS11 replicated at >4 
Log10-higher titers at 32 °C than at 39 °C. TS11 has multiple mutations, 
including those in nsp3, a 12-amino acid-deletion spanning the furin cleavage 
site of the S protein and a 371-nucleotide-deletion spanning the ORF7b-ORF8 
genes. We tested the pathogenicity and protective efficacy of TS11 against 
challenge with a heterologous virulent SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain 14B in Syrian 
hamsters. Hamsters were randomly assigned to mock immunization-challenge 
(Mock-C) and TS11 immunization-challenge (TS11-C) groups. Like the mock group, 
TS11-vaccinated hamsters did not show any clinical signs and continuously gained 
body weight. TS11 replicated well in the nasal cavity but poorly in the lungs 
and caused only mild lesions in the lungs. After challenge, hamsters in the 
Mock-C group lost weight. In contrast, the animals in the TS11-C group continued 
gaining weight. The virus titers in the nasal turbinates and lungs of the TS11-C 
group were significantly lower than those in the Mock-C group, confirming the 
protective effects of TS11 immunization of hamsters. Histopathological 
examination demonstrated that animals in the Mock-C group had severe pulmonary 
lesions and large amounts of viral antigens in the lungs post-challenge; 
however, the TS11-C group had minimal pathological changes and few viral 
antigen-positive cells. In summary, the TS11 mutant was attenuated and induced 
protection against disease after a heterologous SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Syrian 
hamsters.
