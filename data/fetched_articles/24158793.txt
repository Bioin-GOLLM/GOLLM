Structural and thermodynamic signatures that define pseudotriloop RNA hairpins.

Pseudotriloop (PTL) structures in RNAs have been recognized as essential 
elements in RNA folding and recognition of proteins. PTL structures are derived 
from hexaloops by formation of a cross-loop base pair leaving a triloop and 3' 
bulged out residue. Despite their common presence and functional importance, 
insufficient structural and thermodynamic data are available that can be used to 
predict formation of PTLs from sequence alone. Using NMR spectroscopy and 
UV-melting data we established factors that contribute to the formation and 
stability of PTL structures derived from hepatitis B virus and human foamy 
virus. The NMR data show that, besides the cross-loop base pair, also a 3' 
pyrimidine bulge and a G-C loop-closing base pair are primary determinants of 
PTL formation. By changing the G-C closing base pair into C-G, the PTL switches 
into a hexaloop. Comparison of these rules with regular triloop hairpins and 
PTLs from other sources is discussed as well as the conservation of a PTL in 
human foamy virus and other spumaretroviruses.
