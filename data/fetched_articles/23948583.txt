Recent advances in the burgeoning field of genome engineering are accelerating 
the realization of personalized therapeutics for cardiovascular disease. In the 
postgenomic era, sequence-specific gene-editing tools enable the functional 
analysis of genetic alterations implicated in disease. In partnership with 
high-throughput model systems, efficient gene manipulation provides an 
increasingly powerful toolkit to study phenotypes associated with 
patient-specific genetic defects. Herein, this review emphasizes the latest 
developments in genome engineering and how applications within the field are 
transforming our understanding of personalized medicine with an emphasis on 
cardiovascular diseases.
