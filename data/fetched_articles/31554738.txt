Adult stem and progenitor cells are uniquely capable of self-renewal, and 
targeting this process represents a potential therapeutic opportunity. The early 
erythroid progenitor, burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), has substantial 
self-renewal potential and serves as a key cell type for the treatment of 
anemias. However, our understanding of mechanisms underlying BFU-E self-renewal 
is extremely limited. Here, we found that the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, 
cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 4 (CHRM4), pathway regulates BFU-E self-renewal 
and that pharmacological inhibition of CHRM4 corrects anemias of myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS), aging, and hemolysis. Genetic down-regulation of CHRM4 or 
pharmacologic inhibition of CHRM4 using the selective antagonist PD102807 
promoted BFU-E self-renewal, whereas deletion of Chrm4 increased erythroid cell 
production under stress conditions in vivo. Moreover, muscarinic acetylcholine 
receptor antagonists corrected anemias in mouse models of MDS, aging, and 
hemolysis in vivo, extending the survival of mice with MDS relative to that of 
controls. The effects of muscarinic receptor antagonism on promoting expansion 
of BFU-Es were mediated by cyclic AMP induction of the transcription factor 
CREB, whose targets up-regulated key regulators of BFU-E self-renewal. On the 
basis of these data, we propose a model of hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal 
through a cholinergic-mediated "hematopoietic reflex" and identify muscarinic 
acetylcholine receptor antagonists as potential therapies for anemias associated 
with MDS, aging, and hemolysis.
