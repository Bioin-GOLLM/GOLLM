BACKGROUND: It has been found that ITPase deficiency is caused by ITPA gene 
polymorphisms. It was observed that ITPA polymorphisms have impact on 
hematological changes, including hemoglobin (Hb)-decline during treatment of 
chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) plus 
ribavirin (RBV).
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the effect of ITPA and C20orf194 
polymorphisms on hematological changes at week 4 of treatment with PEG-IFN plus 
RBV in patients with CHC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 168 patients with CHC (56% 
HCV genotype-1 and 44% HCV genotype-3) under the treatment of PEG-IFN plus RBV 
were genotyped for rs1127354, rs7270101 and rs6051702 polymorphisms by the 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. 
Hematological changes including Hb-, platelet (Plt)- and white blood 
cell-decline at week 4 of the treatment were assessed.
RESULTS: In univariate analysis, rs1127354 and HCV genotypes were found to 
influence the Hb-decline at week 4 of the treatment. In multivariate analysis, 
rs1127354 CA + AA and HCV genotype-3 were found to have a great role on 
prevention of Hb-decline. Furthermore, rs1127354 and HCV RNA levels were found 
to influence the Plt-decline at week 4 of the treatment in the univariate 
analysis. In multivariate analysis, rs1127354 CA + AA and HCV RNA levels less 
than 600,000 IU/mL were found to be associated with a higher level of 
Plt-decline.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CHC, who were treated with PEG-IFN plus RBV, 
Hb-decline was affected by rs1127354 and HCV genotypes. However, Plt-decline may 
be altered by rs1127354 and baseline HCV RNA levels.
