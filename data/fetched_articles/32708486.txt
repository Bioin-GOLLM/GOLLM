Well-ordered bioreceptors on atomically flat Au surfaces can be a 
high-performance biosensor. Cardiac troponin I proteins (cTnIs) have been 
regarded as a specific biomarker for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Here, we 
report the accurate detection of cTnIs using an aptamer-immobilized Au nanoplate 
platform. The single-crystalline and atomically flat Au nanoplate was 
characterized by atomic force microscopy. For the precise detection of cTnI, we 
immobilized an aptamer that can strongly bind to cTnI onto an atomically flat Au 
nanoplate. Using the aptamer-immobilized Au nanoplate, cTnIs were successfully 
detected at a concentration of 100 aM (2.4 fg/mL) in buffer solution. 
Furthermore, cTnIs in serum could be identified at a concentration of 100 fM 
(2.4 pg/mL). The total assay time was ~7 h. Importantly, the aptamer-immobilized 
Au nanoplate enabled us to diagnose AMI patients accurately, suggesting the 
potential of the present method in the diagnosis of AMI.
