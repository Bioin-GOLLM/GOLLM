Congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT) constitute the 
most common cause of early-onset chronic kidney disease. In a previous study, we 
identified a heterozygous truncating variant in nuclear receptor-interacting 
protein 1 (NRIP1) as CAKUT causing via dysregulation of retinoic acid signaling. 
This large family remains the only family with NRIP1 variant reported so far. 
Here, we describe one additional CAKUT family with a truncating variant in 
NRIP1. By whole-exome sequencing, we identified one heterozygous frameshift 
variant (p.Asn676Lysfs*27) in an isolated CAKUT patient with bilateral 
hydroureteronephrosis and right grade V vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and in the 
affected father with left renal hypoplasia. The variant is present twice in a 
heterozygous state in the gnomAD database of 125,000 control individuals. We 
report the second CAKUT family with a truncating variant in NRIP1, confirming 
that loss-of-function mutations in NRIP1 are a novel monogenic cause of human 
autosomal dominant CAKUT.
