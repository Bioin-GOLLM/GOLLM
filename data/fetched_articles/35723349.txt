Diabetes mellitus is a disorder characterized by higher levels of blood glucose 
due to impaired insulin mechanisms. Alpha glucosidase is a critical drug target 
implicated in the mechanisms of diabetes mellitus and its inhibition controls 
hyperglycemia. Since the existing standard synthetic drugs have therapeutic 
limitations, it is imperative to identify new potent inhibitors of natural 
product origin which may slow carbohydrate digestion and absorption via alpha 
glucosidase. Since plant extracts from Calotropis procera have been extensively 
used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, the present study used molecular 
docking and dynamics simulation techniques to screen its constituents against 
the receptor alpha glucosidase. Taraxasterol, syriogenin, 
isorhamnetin-3-O-robinobioside and calotoxin were identified as potential novel 
lead compounds with plausible binding energies of -40.2, -35.1, -34.3 and -34.3 
kJ/mol against alpha glucosidase, respectively. The residues Trp481, Asp518, 
Leu677, Leu678 and Leu680 were identified as critical for binding and the 
compounds were predicted as alpha glucosidase inhibitors. Structurally similar 
compounds with Tanimoto coefficients greater than 0.7 were reported 
experimentally to be inhibitors of alpha glucosidase or antidiabetic. The 
structures of the molecules may serve as templates for the design of novel 
inhibitors and warrant in vitro assaying to corroborate their antidiabetic 
potential.
