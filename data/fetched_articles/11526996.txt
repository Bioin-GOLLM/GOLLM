BACKGROUND: Genetic factors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the 
movement disorder tardive dyskinesia, which may involve dopamine-serotonin 
interaction. Case-control association studies have identified the T102C 
polymorphism of the 5-HT2A receptor gene as being associated with schizophrenia 
and responsiveness to clozapine. In this study, we examine the association of 
this polymorphism in the 5-HT2A receptor gene as a risk factor for developing 
schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia from prolonged treatment with neuroleptics.
METHODS: Ninety-seven healthy control subjects with no history of mental illness 
and 221 schizophrenic patients (87 with tardive dyskinesia, 134 without) were 
genotyped by PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: Comparison between cases and control subjects revealed no significant 
association between the C allele and schizophrenia. There was significant 
difference in allele frequency (p = .044, OR = 1.54 95% CI = 1.02-2.33) between 
patients who developed tardive dyskinesia and those who did not. Significant 
difference remains even after adjusting for age and neuroleptic dosage (p = 
.041) with the odds ratio at 1.64 (95% CI = 1.02-2.62).
CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant of the 5-HT2A receptor may be associated with 
neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenia. Further studies are 
needed to replicate the finding. The role of 5-HT2A receptor in the etiology of 
tardive dyskinesia or treatment-resistant schizophrenia should be further 
investigated.
