Apart from the RET proto-oncogene (RET) no other genes have been found to be 
involved in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) tumorigenesis. Germline RET 
mutations are seen virtually in all familial forms of MTC and somatic RET 
mutations are often detected in sporadic MTC. In sporadic MTCs the RET gene is 
mutated in codon 918, where a methionine is substituted to a threonine (M918T). 
In this study 24 MTCs were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) 
for chromosomal imbalances. Overall, alterations were detected in approximately 
60% of the samples. The most common aberrations were gains on chromosome 19q 
(29%), 19p (21%), 11c-q12 (12.5%), and 22q (12.5%) and losses on 13q21 (21%) and 
3q23-qter (12.5%). Gain of chromosome 11c-q12 was only detected in samples from 
patients whom died of MTC (p=0.001). These MTCs also harbored the somatic RET 
M918T mutation and also showed the highest numbers of CGH alterations in the 
series (p<0.003). Although there was a tendency towards a higher number of CGH 
imbalances in the tumors with RET M918T mutation, this difference was not 
significant. The results indicate that MTC is a comparatively genetically stable 
tumor, and that chromosomal regions 19q, 19p, 13q and 11q may be involved in MTC 
carcinogenesis.
