OBJECTIVE: False-positive BRAF analysis on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has 
rarely been reported in the literature but may become more common with the 
advent of assays that can detect the BRAF V600E mutation in only 2% of otherwise 
wild-type thyroid cells. We present the case of an indeterminate BRAF-positive 
FNA that showed no evidence of cancer on final surgical pathology.
METHODS: Case report and literature review.
RESULTS: An 87-year-old female with an indeterminate 1.7-cm nodule but 
BRAF-positive cytology underwent thyroid lobectomy. Final pathology revealed a 
benign adenomatoid nodule. An area rich in tumor cells from the nodule was 
identified, labeled, and microdissected for molecular testing, which 
demonstrated only wild-type BRAF, at the analytical limit of the assay.
CONCLUSION: Increasingly sensitive BRAF assays using dual-priming 
oligonucleotide-based multiplex polymerase chain reaction analysis can detect 
the BRAF V600E mutation when present in only 2% of a population of wild-type 
cells. This increases the risk of false-positive results, particularly in cases 
of indeterminate FNA. Clinicians must caution patients in these circumstances 
that BRAF molecular testing may not have a 100% positive predictive value.
