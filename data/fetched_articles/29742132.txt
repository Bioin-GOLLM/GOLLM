BACKGROUND: Few data on HIV resistance in pregnancy are available from 
Mozambique, one of the countries with the highest HIV toll worldwide. 
Understanding the patterns of HIV drug resistance in pregnant women might help 
in tailoring optimal regimens for prevention of mother to child transmission of 
HIV (pMTCT) and antenatal care.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency and characteristics of HIV drug resistance 
mutations (HIVDRM) in pregnant women with virological failure at delivery, 
despite pMTCT or antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHODS: Samples from HIV-infected pregnant women from a rural area in southern 
Mozambique were analysed. Only women with HIV-1 RNA >400c/mL at delivery were 
included in the analysis. HIVDRM were determined using MiSeq® (detection 
threshold 1%) at the first antenatal care (ANC) visit and at the time of 
delivery.
RESULTS: Ninety and 60 samples were available at the first ANC visit and 
delivery, respectively. At first ANC, 97% of the women had HIV-1 RNA>400c/mL, 
39% had CD4+ counts <350 c/mm3 and 30% were previously not on ART. Thirteen 
women (14%) had at least one HIVDRM of whom 70% were not on previous ART. Eight 
women (13%) had at least one HIVDRM at delivery. Out of 37 women with data 
available from the two time points, 8 (21%) developed at least one new HIVDRM 
during pMTCT or ART. Twenty seven per cent (53/191), 32% (44/138) and 100% (5/5) 
of the mutations that were present at enrolment, delivery and that emerged 
during pregnancy, respectively, were minority mutations (frequency <20%).
CONCLUSIONS: Even with ultrasensitive HIV-1 genotyping, less than 20% of women 
with detectable viremia at delivery had HIVDRM before initiating pMTCT or ART. 
This suggests that factors other than pre-existing resistance, such as lack of 
adherence or interruptions of the ANC chain, are also relevant to explain lack 
of virological suppression at the time of delivery in women receiving 
antiretrovirals drugs during pregnancy.
