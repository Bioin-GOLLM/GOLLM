Insulin resistance is an essential feature of the metabolic syndrome that has 
been linked to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Understanding how inflammation arising 
in one tissue affects the physiology and pathology of other organs remains an 
unanswered question with therapeutic implications for chronic conditions 
including obesity, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, and RA. Adipokines may 
play a role in the development of atherogenesis in patients with RA. Biologic 
therapies, such as TNF-α antagonists, that block proinflammatory cytokines have 
beneficial effects on the insulin resistance that is often observed in patients 
with RA.
