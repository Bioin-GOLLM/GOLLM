BACKGROUND: Therapy discontinuations and toxicities occur because of significant 
interindividual variations in 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and methotrexate (MTX) 
response during maintenance therapy of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL). 6-MP/MTX intolerance in some of the patients cannot be explained by 
thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) gene variants. In this study, we aimed to 
investigate candidate pharmacogenetic determinants of 6-MP and MTX intolerance 
in Turkish ALL children.
METHODS: In total, 48 children with ALL who had completed or were receiving 
maintenance therapy according to Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols were 
enrolled. Fifteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 8 candidate genes that were 
related to drug toxicity or had a role in the 6-MP/MTX metabolism (TPMT, ITPA, 
MTHFR, IMPDH2, PACSIN2, SLCO1B1, ABCC4, and PYGL) were genotyped by competitive 
allele-specific PCR (KASP). Drug doses during maintenance therapy were modified 
according to the protocol.
RESULTS: The median drug dose intensity was 50% (28% to 92%) for 6-MP and 58% 
(27% to 99%) for MTX in the first year of maintenance therapy, which were lower 
than that scheduled in all patients. Among the analyzed polymorphisms, variant 
alleles in SLCO1B1 rs4149056 and rs11045879 were found to be associated with 
lower 6-MP/MTX tolerance.
CONCLUSIONS: SLCO1B1 rs4149056 and rs11045879 polymorphisms may be important 
genetic markers to individualize 6-MP/MTX doses.
