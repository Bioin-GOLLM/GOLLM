The oncogene RAS is known to induce genomic instability, leading to cancer 
development; the underlying mechanism, however, remains poorly understood. To 
better understand how RAS functions, we measured the activity of the 
functionally related genes Aurora-A and BRCA2 in ovarian cancer cell lines and 
tumor samples containing RAS mutations. We found that Aurora-A and BRCA2 
inversely controlled RAS-associated genomic instability and ovarian 
tumorigenesis through regulation of cytokinesis and polyploidization. 
Overexpression of mutated RAS ablated BRCA2 expression but induced Aurora-A 
accumulation at the midbody, leading to abnormal cytokinesis and ultimately 
chromosomal instability via polyploidy in cancer cells. RAS regulates the 
expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 through dysregulated protein expression of 
farnesyl protein transferase β and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3. 
Our results suggest that the imbalance in expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 
regulates RAS-induced genomic instability and tumorigenesis.
