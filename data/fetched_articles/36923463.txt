Introduction: Achieving a successful reconstruction of alveolar bone morphology 
still remains a challenge because of the irregularity and complex 
microenvironment of tooth sockets. Biological materials including hydroxyapatite 
and collagen, are used for alveolar ridge preservation. However, the healing 
effect is often unsatisfactory. Methods: Inspired by superwetting biomimetic 
materials, we constructed a 3D actively-spreading bone repair material. It 
consisted of photocurable polyether F127 diacrylate hydrogel loaded with mixed 
spheroids of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and vascular endothelial cells (ECs). 
Results: Biologically, cells in the spheroids were able to spread and migrate 
outwards, and possessed both osteogenic and angiogenic potential. Meanwhile, ECs 
also enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Mechanically, the excellent 
physical properties of F127DA hydrogel ensured that it was able to be injected 
directly into the tooth socket and stabilized after light curing. In vivo 
experiments showed that MSC-EC-F127DA system promoted bone repair and preserved 
the shape of alveolar ridge within a short time duration. Discussion: In 
conclusion, the novel photocurable injectable MSC-EC-F127DA hydrogel system was 
able to achieve three-dimensional tissue infiltration, and exhibited much 
therapeutic potential for complex oral bone defects in the future.
