Glucose transport across the blood brain barrier and into neural cells is 
critical for normal cerebral physiologic function. Dysfunction of the cerebral 
glucose transporter GLUT1 (encoded by SLC2A1) is known to result in epilepsy, 
intellectual disability (ID), and movement disorder. Using whole-exome 
sequencing, we identified rare homozygous missense variants (c.526C>T 
[p.Arg176Trp] and c.629C>T [p.Ala210Val]) in SLC45A1, encoding another cerebral 
glucose transporter, in two consanguineous multiplex families with moderate to 
severe ID, epilepsy, and variable neuropsychiatric features. The variants 
segregate with the phenotype in these families, affect well-conserved amino 
acids, and are predicted to be damaging by in silico programs. Intracellular 
glucose transport activity of the p.Arg176Trp and p.Ala210Val SLC45A1 variants, 
measured in transfected COS-7 cells, was approximately 50% (p = 0.013) and 33% 
(p = 0.008) lower, respectively, than that of intact SLC45A1. These results 
indicate that residues at positions 176 and 210 are critical for the glucose 
transport activity of SLC45A1. All together, our data strongly suggest that 
recessive mutations in SLC45A1 cause ID and epilepsy. SLC45A1 thus represents 
the second cerebral glucose transporter, in addition to GLUT1, to be involved in 
neurodevelopmental disability. Identification of additional individuals with 
mutations in SLC45A1 will allow better definition of the associated phenotypic 
spectrum and the exploration of potential targeted treatment options.
