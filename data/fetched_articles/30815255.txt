BACKGROUND: Nepal and Bangladesh have a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori 
with high resistance rates to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin. 
Here, we evaluated the susceptibility and genetic mutations of 5 alternative 
antibiotics against isolates from both countries to obtain an effective 
treatment regimen for H. pylori eradication.
METHODS: We used the agar dilution method to determine the minimal inhibitory 
concentration of 5 alternative antibiotics against 42 strains from Nepal and 56 
from Bangladesh and performed whole genome mutation analysis.
RESULTS: No resistance to furazolidone or rifabutin and a high susceptibility of 
sitafloxacin (95.2% in Nepal and 98.2% in Bangladesh) were observed. In 
contrast, resistance to rifaximin (52.4% in Nepal and 64.3% in Bangladesh) was 
high. Moreover, resistance to garenoxacin was higher in Bangladesh (51.6%) than 
in Nepal (28.6%, P = 0.041), most likely due to its correlation with 
levofloxacin resistance (P = 0.03). Garenoxacin and rifaximin were significantly 
correlated in Bangladesh (P = 0.014) and occurred together with all 
sitafloxacin-resistant strains. Mutations of gyrA could play a significant role 
in garenoxacin resistance, and double mutations of A87 and D91 were associated 
with sitafloxacin resistance. Analysis of the rpoB gene demonstrated well-known 
mutations, such as V657I, and several novel mutations, including I2619V, 
V2592 L, T2537A, and F2538 L.
CONCLUSIONS: Rifabutin can be cautiously implemented as therapy for H. pylori 
infection due to its interaction with the tuberculosis endemic in Bangladesh. 
The high susceptibility of furazolidone and sitafloxacin suggests their possible 
future application in Nepal and Bangladesh.
