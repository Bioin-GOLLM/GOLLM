BACKGROUND: Although many epidemiologic studies have investigated the CYP1A1 
MspI gene polymorphisms and their associations with esophageal cancer (EC), 
definite conclusions cannot be drawn. To clarify the effects of CYP1A1 MspI 
polymorphisms on the risk of EC, a meta-analysis was performed in Chinese 
population.
METHODS: Related studies were identified from PubMed, Springer Link, Ovid, 
Chinese Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, Chinese National Knowledge 
Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Biology Medicine (CBM) till October 2014. 
Pooled ORs and 95% CIs were used to assess the strength of the associations.
RESULTS: A total of 13 studies including 1,519 EC cases and 1,962 controls were 
involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, significant association was found 
between CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism and EC risk when all studies in the Chinese 
population pooled into this meta-analysis (C vs. T: OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.04 to 
1.51; CC + CT vs. TT: OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.72; CC vs. TT + CT: OR = 
1.35, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.76). When we performed stratified analyses by 
geographical locations, histopathology type, and source of control, 
significantly increased risks were found in North China (C vs. T: OR = 1.38, 95% 
CI = 1.12 to 1.70; CC vs. TT: OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.16 to 2.56; CC + CT vs. TT: 
OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.14 to 2.02; CC vs. TT + CT: OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.17 to 
2.06), in the population-based studies (C vs. T: OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.05 to 
1.42; CC vs. TT: OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.88; CC + CT vs. TT: OR = 1.36, 
95% CI = 1.10 to 1.69; CC vs. TT + CT: OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.81) and 
ESCC (C vs. T: OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.32; CC + CT vs. TT: OR = 1.28, 95% 
CI = 1.08 to 1.52).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides the evidence that CYP1A1 MspI 
polymorphism may contribute to the EC development in the Chinese population.
