OBJECTIVE: NINJ2 regulates activation of vascular endothelial cells, and 
genome-wide association studies showed that variants in NINJ2 confer risk to 
stroke. However, whether variants in NINJ2 are associated with coronary artery 
disease (CAD) is unknown.
METHODS: We genotyped rs34166160 in NINJ2 in two independent Chinese GeneID 
populations which included 2,794 CAD cases and 4,131 controls, and performed 
genetics association studies. Functional studies were also performed to reveal 
the mechanisms.
RESULTS: Allele rs34166160 significantly confers risk to CAD in the GeneID Hubei 
population which contained 1,440 CAD cases and 2,660 CAD-free controls (observed 
P-obs = 6.39 × 10-3 with an odds ratio (OR) was 3.39, adjusted P-adj = 8.12 × 
10-3 with an OR of 3.10). The association was replicated in another population, 
GeneID Shandong population contained 1,354 CAD cases and 1,471 controls (P-obs = 
3.33 × 10-3 with an OR of 3.14, P-adj = 0.01 with an OR of 2.74). After 
combining the two populations, the association was more significant (P-obs = 
1.57 × 10-5 with an OR of 3.58, P-adj = 3.41 × 10-4 with an OR of 2.80). In 
addition, we found that rs34166160 was associated with the mRNA expression level 
of NINJ2 and the flanking region of rs34166160 can directly bind with 
transcriptional factor CCAAT-box/enhancer-binding protein beta, and the risk A 
allele has more transcription activity than non-risk C allele with or without 
LPS in HUVEC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the functional rare variant rs34166160 
in NINJ2 confers risk to CAD for the first time, and these findings further 
expand the range of the pathology of CAD and atherosclerosis.
