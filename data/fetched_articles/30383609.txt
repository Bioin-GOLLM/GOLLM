Adenomatous polyps of the vulva and vagina are extremely rare. We report a case 
of a 74-yr-old women with a tubulovillous adenoma occurring in the vagina, and a 
second one occurring later in the vulva. Tumor cells in both lesions were CK7, 
CK20, CDX-2, and showed intact mismatch-repair proteins. A G13D (c.38G>A, 
p.Gly13Asp) mutation in the KRAS gene was identified in both masses. As well, a 
novel frameshift truncating mutation (c.4320delA, p.Pro1441fsTer32) in the APC 
gene was detected only in the vaginal mass, ruling out the possibility that the 
vulvar mass was a local recurrence of the vaginal mass. This is the first 
identification of KRAS and APC gene mutations in adenomatous polyps involving 
the female lower genital tract.
