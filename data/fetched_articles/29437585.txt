OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the role of serum uric acid (SUA) level in a 
broad spectrum of disease outcomes using data for 120 091 individuals from UK 
Biobank.
METHODS: We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify 
disease outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci. We then implemented 
conventional Mendelianrandomisation (MR) analysis to investigate the causal 
relevance between SUA level and disease outcomes identified from PheWAS. We next 
applied MR Egger analysis to detect and account for potential pleiotropy, which 
conventional MR analysis might mistake for causality, and used the HEIDI 
(heterogeneity in dependent instruments) test to remove cross-phenotype 
associations that were likely due to genetic linkage.
RESULTS: Our PheWAS identified 25 disease groups/outcomes associated with SUA 
genetic risk loci after multiple testing correction (P<8.57e-05). Our 
conventional MR analysis implicated a causal role of SUA level in three disease 
groups: inflammatory polyarthropathies (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.34), 
hypertensive disease (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14) and disorders of metabolism 
(OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14); and four disease outcomes: gout (OR=4.88, 95% CI 
3.91 to 6.09), essential hypertension (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14), myocardial 
infarction (OR=1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.30) and coeliac disease (OR=1.41, 95% CI 
1.05 to 1.89). After balancing pleiotropic effects in MR Egger analysis, only 
gout and its encompassing disease group of inflammatory polyarthropathies were 
considered to be causally associated with SUA level. Our analysis highlighted a 
locus (ATXN2/S2HB3) that may influence SUA level and multiple cardiovascular and 
autoimmune diseases via pleiotropy.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SUA level is convincing to cause gout and inflammatory 
polyarthropathies, and might act as a marker for the wider range of diseases 
with which it associates. Our findings support further investigation on the 
clinical relevance of SUA level with cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune and 
respiratory diseases.
