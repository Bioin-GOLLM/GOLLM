Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is a post-translational modification that produces 
poly(ADP-ribose) with a branched structure every 20-50 units; such branching 
structure has been previously suggested to be involved in regulating chromatin 
remodeling. To elucidate its detailed functions, we developed a straightforward 
method for the synthesis of the poly(ADP-ribose) branched core structure, 
α-d-ribofuranosyl-(1‴ → 2″)-α-d-ribofuranosyl-(1″ → 2')-adenosine 
5',5'',5‴-trisphosphate 1, from 6-chloropurine ribofuranoside 4 in 10 steps and 
6.1% overall yield. The structure poses synthetic challenges for constructing 
iterative α-1,2-cis-glycosidic bonds in the presence of a purine base and the 
installation of three phosphate groups at primary hydroxyl groups. Iterative 
glycosidic bonds were formed by α-1,2-cis-selective ribofuranosylation using 
2-O-(2-naphthylmethyl)-protected thioglycoside donor 6 and a thiophilic bismuth 
promoter. After the construction of diribofuranosyl adenosine 5 had been 
constructed, it was chemo- and regioselectively phosphorylated at a later stage. 
Subsequent deprotection provided the synthetic target 1.
