OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative 
diseases induced by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by meta-analysis.
METHODS: Relevant literature was searched from Wanfang Medical Center, CNQI, 
VIP, PubMed, and other domestic and foreign literature databases for the 
research direction, and the risk of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative 
diseases induced by MMPs was meta-analyzed using the fixed-effect model and 
random-effect model.
RESULTS: MMP-1 and MMP-9 were risk factors for cardiovascular diseases by fixed 
and random-effect model analysis, respectively, while MMP-2 and MMP-9 were risk 
factors for increased neurodegenerative diseases by random-effect model 
analysis.
CONCLUSION: MMP-1 and MMP-9 are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, and 
MMP-2 and MMP-9 are major factors for increased risk of neurodegenerative 
diseases. MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 can be used as new targets for clinical 
diagnosis, treatment, and research of subsequent cardiovascular and 
neurodegenerative diseases.
