Automated characterization of anthropomorphicity of prosthetic feet fitted to 
bone-anchored transtibial prosthesis.

OBJECTIVE: This study describes differentiating prosthetic feet designs fitted 
to bone-anchored transtibial prostheses based on an automated characterization 
of ankle stiffness profile relying on direct loading measurements. The 
objectives were (A) to present a process characterizing stiffness using 
innovative macro, meso and micro analyses, (B) to present stiffness profiles for 
feet with and without anthropomorphic designs, where anthropomorphicity is 
defined as a similarity of the moment-angle dependency in prosthetic and in the 
anatomical ankle, (C) to determine sensitivity of characterization.
METHODS: Three participants walked consecutively with two instrumented 
bone-anchored prostheses including their own prosthetic feet and Free-Flow foot 
meeting the anthropomorphicity criterion by design. Angle of dorsiflexion was 
extracted from video footage. Bending moment was recorded using multi-axis 
transducer attached to osseointegrated fixation. The automated characterization 
of stiffness involved a 12-step process relying on data-based criterion.
RESULTS: The meso analyses confirmed bilinear behavior of moment-angle curves 
with Index of Anthropomorphicity of -2.966±2.369 Nm/Deg and 2.681±1.089 Nm/Deg 
indicating a convex and concave shape of usual and Free-Flow feet without and 
with anthropomorphic designs, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed straightforward meso analysis of the stiffness was 
capable to report clinical meaningful differences sensitive to feet's 
anthropomorphicity. Results confirmed the benefits for clinicians to rely on 
direct loading measurement providing individualized complementary insight into 
impact of components.
SIGNIFICANCE: This work could assist the developments of standards and 
guidelines for manufacturing and safe fitting of components to growing 
population requiring transtibial prostheses with socket or direct skeletal 
attachment worldwide.
