Bipolar disorder (BD) is a major psychiatric illness affecting around 1% of the 
global population. BD is characterized by recurrent manic and depressive 
episodes, and has an estimated heritability of around 70%. Research has 
identified the first BD susceptibility genes. However, the underlying pathways 
and regulatory networks remain largely unknown. Research suggests that the 
cumulative impact of common alleles with small effects explains only around 
25-38% of the phenotypic variance for BD. A plausible hypothesis therefore is 
that rare, high penetrance variants may contribute to BD risk. The present study 
investigated the role of rare, nonsynonymous, and potentially functional 
variants via whole exome sequencing in 15 BD cases from two large, multiply 
affected families from Cuba. The high prevalence of BD in these pedigrees 
renders them promising in terms of the identification of genetic risk variants 
with large effect sizes. In addition, SNP array data were used to calculate 
polygenic risk scores for affected and unaffected family members. After 
correction for multiple testing, no significant increase in polygenic risk 
scores for common, BD-associated genetic variants was found in BD cases compared 
to healthy relatives. Exome sequencing identified a total of 17 rare and 
potentially damaging variants in 17 genes. The identified variants were shared 
by all investigated BD cases in the respective pedigree. The most promising 
variant was located in the gene SERPING1 (p.L349F), which has been reported 
previously as a genome-wide significant risk gene for schizophrenia. The present 
data suggest novel candidate genes for BD susceptibility, and may facilitate the 
discovery of disease-relevant pathways and regulatory networks.
