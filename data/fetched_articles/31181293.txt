The purpose of our study is to understand the protective role of miR-455-3p 
against abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, amyloid beta (Aβ) 
formation, defective mitochondrial biogenesis/dynamics and synaptic damage in AD 
progression. In-silico analysis of miR-455-3p has identified the APP gene as a 
putative target. Using mutant APP cells, miR-455-3p construct, biochemical and 
molecular assays, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 
analyses, we studied the protective effects of miR-455-3p on - 1) APP 
regulation, amyloid beta (Aβ)(1-40) & (1-42) levels, mitochondrial biogenesis & 
dynamics; 3) synaptic activities and 4) cell viability & apoptosis. Our 
luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding of miR-455-3p at the 3'UTR of 
APP gene. Immunoblot, sandwich ELISA and immunostaining analyses revealed that 
the reduced levels of the mutant APP, Aβ(1-40) & Aβ(1-42), and C99 by 
miR-455-3p. We also found the reduced levels of mRNA and proteins of 
mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC1α, NRF1, NRF2, and TFAM) and synaptic genes 
(synaptophysin and PSD95) in mutant APP cells; on the other hand, mutant APP 
cells that express miR-455-3p showed increased mRNA and protein levels of 
biogenesis and synaptic genes. Additionally, expression of mitochondrial fission 
proteins (DRP1 and FIS1) were decreased while the fusion proteins (OPA1, Mfn1 
and Mfn2) were increased by miR-455-3p. Our TEM analysis showed a decrease in 
mitochondria number and an increase in the size of mitochondrial length in 
mutant APP cells transfected with miR-455-3p. Based on these observations, we 
cautiously conclude that miR-455-3p regulate APP processing and protective 
against mutant APP-induced mitochondrial and synaptic abnormalities in AD.
