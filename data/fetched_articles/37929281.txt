A 6 year-old spayed female Poodle presented with a mandibular mass. Radiographic 
examination revealed osteolysis from the right mandibular canine to the fourth 
premolar, along with horizontal bone loss and dorsal displacement of the right 
mandibular first and second premolars. Skull cone beam computed tomography 
revealed osteolysis at the level of the right mandibular canine and fourth 
premolar. A destructive bone lesion was observed in the apical area of the right 
mandibular canine, with mass invasion of the interradicular bone of the right 
mandibular first molar near the mandibular canal. Consequently, unilateral total 
mandibulectomy and skin flap surgery were performed. Histopathological 
examination revealed poorly demarcated and infiltrative neoplastic epithelial 
cells that formed small islands and trabeculae. Neoplastic cells exhibited the 
malignant features of cytological atypia and high mitotic activity. Furthermore, 
the neoplastic epithelial cells frequently showed ghost cell changes and were 
diagnosed as ghost cell odontogenic carcinoma (GCOC). The dog was followed up 
for 1 year, during which no severe complications or local recurrence was 
observed, except for slight mandibular drift, tongue protrusion, and drooling. 
This case report describes the clinical features, diagnostic imaging, and 
histologic features of an unreported GCOC in a dog and the favorable outcome 
following surgical resection.
