Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels consist of two types of α-subunits: (a) 
electrically-active Kcnb1 α-subunits and (b) silent or modulatory α-subunits 
plus β-subunits that, similar to silent α-subunits, also regulate 
electrically-active subunits. Voltage-gated potassium channels were 
traditionally viewed, mainly by electrophysiologists, as regulators of the 
electrical activity of the plasma membrane in excitable cells, a role that is 
performed by transmembrane protein domains of α-subunits that form the electric 
pore. Genetic studies revealed a role for this region of α-subunits of 
voltage-gated potassium channels in human neurodevelopmental disorders, such as 
epileptic encephalopathy. The N- and C-terminal domains of α-subunits interact 
to form the cytoplasmic subunit of heterotetrameric potassium channels that 
regulate electric pores. Subsequent animal studies revealed the developmental 
functions of Kcnb1-containing voltage-gated potassium channels and illustrated 
their role during brain development and reproduction. These functions of 
potassium channels are discussed in this review in the context of regulatory 
interactions between electrically-active and regulatory subunits.
