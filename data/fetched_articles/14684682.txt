BACKGROUND: Mutations of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) receptor 
components ENDOGLIN and ALK-1 cause the autosomal dominant vascular disorder 
hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Heterozygous mutations of the type 
II receptor BMPR2 underlie familial primary pulmonary hypertension.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate kindreds presenting with both pulmonary hypertension 
and HHT.
METHODS: Probands and families were identified by specialist pulmonary 
hypertension centres in five countries. DNA sequence analysis of ALK-1, 
ENDOGLIN, and BMPR2 was undertaken. Cellular localisation was investigated by 
heterologous overexpression of mutant constructs in both BAEC and HeLa cells. 
The impact of a novel sequence variant was assessed through comparative analysis 
and computer modelling.
RESULTS: Molecular analysis of 11 probands identified eight missense mutations 
of ALK-1, one of which was observed in two families. Mutations were located 
within exons 5 to 10 of the ALK-1 gene. The majority of ALK-1 mutant constructs 
appeared to be retained within the cell cytoplasm, in the endoplasmic reticulum. 
A novel GS domain mutation, when overexpressed, reached the cell surface but is 
predicted to disrupt conformational changes owing to loss of a critical hydrogen 
bond. Two novel missense mutations were identified in ENDOGLIN.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of pulmonary arterial hypertension and HHT 
identifies an important disease complication and appears most common among 
subjects with defects in ALK-1 receptor signalling. Future studies should focus 
on detailed molecular analysis of the common cellular pathways disrupted by 
mutations of ALK-1 and BMPR2 that cause inherited pulmonary vascular disease.
