Over 17 and 160 types of chemical modifications have been identified in DNA and 
RNA, respectively. The interest in understanding the various biological 
functions of DNA and RNA modifications has lead to the cutting-edged fields of 
epigenomics and epitranscriptomics. Developing chemical and biological tools to 
detect specific modifications in the genome or transcriptome has greatly 
facilitated their study. Here, we review the recent technological advances in 
this rapidly evolving field. We focus on high-throughput detection methods and 
biological findings for these modifications, and discuss questions to be 
addressed as well. We also summarize third-generation sequencing methods, which 
enable long-read and single-molecule sequencing of DNA and RNA modification.
