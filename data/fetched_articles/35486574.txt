BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: PARP inhibitors have been shown to increase the efficacy 
of radiotherapy in preclinical models. Radioimmunotherapy results in selective 
radiation cytotoxicity of targeted tumour cells. Here we investigate the 
combined effect of anti-CD37 β-emitting 177Lu-NNV003 radioimmunotherapy and the 
PARP inhibitor olaparib, and gene expression profiles in CD37 positive 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The combined effect of 177Lu-NNV003 and olaparib was 
studied in seven cell lines using a fixed-ratio ray design, and combination 
index was calculated for each combination concentration. mRNA was extracted 
before and after treatment with the drug combination. After RNA-sequencing, 
hierarchical clustering was performed on basal gene expression profiles and on 
differentially expressed genes after combination treatment from baseline. 
Functional gene annotation analysis of significant differentially expressed 
genes after combination treatment was performed to identify enriched biological 
processes.
RESULTS: The combination of olaparib and 177Lu-NNV003 was synergistic in four of 
seven cell lines, antagonistic in one and both synergistic and antagonistic 
(conditionally synergistic) in two, depending on the concentration ratio between 
olaparib and 177Lu-NNV003. Cells treated with the combination significantly 
overexpressed genes in the TP53 signalling pathway. However, cluster analysis 
did not identify gene clusters that correlate with the sensitivity of cells to 
single agent or combination treatment.
CONCLUSION: The cytotoxic effect of the combination of the PARP inhibitor 
olaparib and the β-emitting radioimmunoconjugate 177Lu-NNV003 was synergistic in 
the majority of tested lymphoma cell lines.
