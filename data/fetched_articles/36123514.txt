The epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a significant global public health 
challenge and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the recent 
proliferation of pharmacological agents for the treatment of T2D, current 
therapies simply treat the symptom, i.e. hyperglycemia, and do not directly 
address the underlying disease process or modify the disease course. This 
article summarizes how genomic discovery has contributed to unraveling the 
heterogeneity in T2D, reviews relevant discoveries in the pharmacogenetics of 
five commonly prescribed glucose-lowering agents, presents evidence supporting 
how pharmacogenetics can be leveraged to advance precision medicine, and calls 
attention to important research gaps to its implementation to guide treatment 
choices.
