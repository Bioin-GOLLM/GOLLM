Adenosine was identified in 1929 and immediately recognised as having a 
potential role in therapy for arrhythmia because of its negative chronotropic 
and dromotropic effects. Adenosine entered mainstream use in the 1980s as a 
highly effective agent for the termination of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) 
involving the atrioventricular node, as well as for its ability to unmask the 
underlying rhythm in other SVTs. Adenosine has subsequently been found to have 
applications in interventional electrophysiology. While considered a safe agent 
because of its short half-life, adenosine may provoke arrhythmias in the form of 
AF, bradyarrhythmia and ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Adenosine is also 
associated with bronchospasm, although this may reflect irritant-induced 
dyspnoea rather than true obstruction. Adenosine is linked to numerous 
pathologies relevant to arrhythmia predisposition, including heart failure, 
obesity, ischaemia and the ageing process itself. This article examines 90 years 
of experience with adenosine in the light of new European Society of Cardiology 
guidelines for the management of SVT.
