Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a major DNA sensor. The recognition of 
cytosolic DNA by cGAS triggers a robust innate immune response that restricts 
the replication of diverse viral pathogens through the type I interferon (IFN) 
and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a 
large and complex DNA virus reported to strongly inhibit the cGAS-STING 
signaling pathway. Herein, 12 ASFV structural proteins were screened to 
determine their effects on the cGAS-STING pathway. Ectopic expression of the 
ASFV caspid protein M1249L significantly inhibited the IFN-β promoter activity 
induced by the cGAS-STING pathway in a dose-dependent manner. And it could also 
downregulate the levels of IFN-β and several interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs) 
induced by cGAS-STING and 2'3'-cGAMP. Moreover, ASFV M1249L also suppressed 
phosphorylation of TBK1 by cGAS and STING overexpression. Further study showed 
that M1249L co-localized and interacted with interferon regulatory factor 3 
(IRF3), which led to induce IRF3 degradation by lysosomal pathway. Taken 
together, our study revealed a novel strategy utilized by ASFV for 
cGAS-STING-related immune evasion.
