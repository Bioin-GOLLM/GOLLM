In patients with metastatic breast cancer the identification of circulating 
tumor cells in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is associated with a poor 
prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Although recent models suggest that the detection of Circulating 
Tumor Cells (CTC) in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EM CTC) might be 
related to disease progression in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients, 
current detection methods are not efficient in identifying this subpopulation of 
cells. Furthermore, the possible association of EM CTC with both 
clinicopathological features and prognosis of MBC patients has still to be 
demonstrated. Aims of this study were: first, to optimize a DEPArray-based 
protocol meant to identify, quantify and sort single, viable EM CTC and, 
subsequently, to test the association of EM CTC frequency with clinical data.
METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled 56 MBC patients 
regardless of the line of treatment. Blood samples, depleted of CD45(pos) 
leukocytes, were stained with an antibody cocktail recognizing both epithelial 
and mesenchymal markers. Four CD45(neg) cell subpopulations were identified: 
cells expressing only epithelial markers (E CTC), cells co-expressing epithelial 
and mesenchymal markers (EM CTC), cells expressing only mesenchymal markers 
(MES) and cells negative for every tested marker (NEG). CTC subpopulations were 
quantified as both absolute cell count and relative frequency. The association 
of CTC subpopulations with clinicopathological features, progression free 
survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) was explored by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney 
test and Univariate Cox Regression Analysis, respectively.
RESULTS: By employing the DEPArray-based strategy, we were able to assess the 
presence of cells pertaining to the above-described classes in every MBC 
patient. We observed a significant association between specific CD45(neg) 
subpopulations and tumor subtypes (e.g. NEG and triple negative), proliferation 
(NEG and Ki67 expression) and sites of metastatic spread (e.g. E CTC and bone; 
NEG and brain). Importantly, the fraction of CD45(neg) cells co-expressing 
epithelial and mesenchymal markers (EM CTC) was significantly associated with 
poorer PFS and OS, computed, this latter, both from the diagnosis of a stage IV 
disease and from the initial CTC assessment.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests the importance of dissecting the heterogeneity 
of CTC in MBC. Precise characterization of CTC could help in estimating both 
metastatization pattern and outcome, driving clinical decision-making and 
surveillance strategies.
