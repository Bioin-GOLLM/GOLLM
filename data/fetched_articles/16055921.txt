Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) interact, in a ligand-dependent fashion, with 
many coregulators that participate in a wide spectrum of biological responses, 
ranging from embryonic development to cellular growth control. The 
transactivating function of these ligand-inducible transcription factors reside 
mainly, but not exclusively, in their ligand-binding domain (AF2), which 
recruits or dismiss coregulators in a ligand-dependent fashion. However, little 
is known about AF2-independent function(s) of RARs. We have isolated the 
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as a repressor of RAR transcriptional 
activity, able to interact with an AF2-crippled RAR. The N-terminus of PCNA 
interacts directly with the DNA-binding domain of RAR, and PCNA is recruited to 
a retinoid-regulated promoter in intact cells. This interaction affects the 
transcriptional response to retinoic acid in a promoter-specific manner, 
conferring an unanticipated role to PCNA in transcriptional regulation. Our 
findings also suggest a role for RAR as a factor coordinating DNA transcription 
and repair.
