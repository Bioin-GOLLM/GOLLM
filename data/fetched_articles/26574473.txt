The hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) play a central role in the 
human oxygen sensing signaling pathway. The binding of the von Hippel-Lindau 
tumor suppressor protein (pVHL)-ElonginC-ElonginB complex (VCB) to HIF-1α is 
highly selective for the trans-4-hydroxylation form of when Pro564 in the 
C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD) of HIF-1α. The binding of 
HIFα for VCB is increased by ∼1000-fold upon addition of a single hydroxyl group 
to either of two conserved proline-residues. Here, we address how this addition 
governs selective recognition and characterizes the strength of the interaction 
of this "switch-like" signaling event. A new set of molecular mechanics 
parameters for 4-hydroxyproline has been developed following the CHARMM force 
field philosophy. Using the free energy perturbation (FEP) formalism, the 
difference in the binding free energies between HIF-1α in the nonhydroxylated 
and hydroxylated forms with the VCB complex was estimated using over 3 μs of MD 
trajectories. These results can favorably be compared to an experimental value 
of ∼4 kcal mol(-1). It is observed that the optimized hydrogen bonding network 
to the buried hydroxyprolyl group confers precise discrimination between 
hydroxylated and unmodified prolyl residues. These observations provide insight 
that will aid in developing therapeutic agents that block HIF-α recognition by 
pVHL.
