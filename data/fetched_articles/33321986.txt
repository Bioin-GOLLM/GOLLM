Erv1 (EC number 1.8.3.2) is an essential mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing protein 
import and oxidative folding in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Erv1 has 
both oxidase and cytochrome c reductase activities. While both Erv1 and 
cytochrome c were reported to be membrane associated in mitochondria, it is 
unknown how the mitochondrial membrane environment may affect the function of 
Erv1. Here, in this study, we used liposomes to mimic the mitochondrial membrane 
and investigated the effect of liposomes and cardiolipin on the folding and 
function of yeast Erv1. Enzyme kinetics of both the oxidase and cytochrome c 
reductase activity of Erv1 were studied using oxygen consumption analysis and 
spectroscopic methods. Our results showed that the presence of liposomes has 
mild impacts on Erv1 oxidase activity, but significantly inhibited the catalytic 
efficiency of Erv1 cytochrome c reductase activity in a cardiolipin-dependent 
manner. Taken together, the results of this study provide important insights 
into the function of Erv1 in the mitochondria, suggesting that molecular oxygen 
is a better substrate than cytochrome c for Erv1 in the yeast mitochondria.
