Cellular decisions are made by complex networks that are difficult to analyze. 
Although it is common to analyze smaller sub-networks known as network motifs, 
it is unclear whether this is valid, because these motifs are embedded in 
complex larger networks. Here, we address the general question of modularity by 
examining the S. cerevisiae pheromone response. We demonstrate that the 
feedforward motif controlling the cell-cycle inhibitor Far1 is insulated from 
cell-cycle dynamics by the positive feedback switch that drives reentry to the 
cell cycle. Before cells switch on positive feedback, the feedforward motif 
model predicts the behavior of the larger network. Conversely, after the switch, 
the feedforward motif is dismantled and has no discernable effect on the cell 
cycle. When insulation is broken, the feedforward motif no longer predicts 
network behavior. This work illustrates how, despite the interconnectivity of 
networks, the activity of motifs can be insulated by switches that generate 
well-defined cellular states.
