OBJECTIVES: Current standard of care imaging, cytology, or cystic fluid analysis 
cannot reliably differentiate malignant from benign pancreatic cystic neoplasms. 
This study sought to determine if the metabolic profile of cystic fluid could 
distinguish benign and malignant lesions, as well as mucinous and non-mucinous 
lesions.
METHODS: Metabolic profiling by untargeted mass spectrometry and quantitative 
nuclear magnetic resonance was performed in 24 pancreatic cyst fluid from 
surgically resected samples with pathological diagnoses and clinicopathological 
correlation.
RESULTS: (Iso)-butyrylcarnitine distinguished malignant from benign pancreatic 
cysts, with a diagnostic accuracy of 89%. (Iso)-butyrylcarnitine was 28-fold 
more abundant in malignant cyst fluid compared with benign cyst fluid (P=.048). 
Furthermore, 5-oxoproline (P=.01) differentiated mucinous from non-mucinous 
cysts with a diagnostic accuracy of 90%, better than glucose (82% accuracy), a 
previously described metabolite that distinguishes mucinous from non-mucinous 
cysts. Combined analysis of glucose and 5-oxoproline did not improve the 
diagnostic accuracy. In comparison, standard of care cyst fluid carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA) and cytology had a diagnostic accuracy of 40% and 60% respectively 
for mucinous cysts. (Iso)-butyrylcarnitine and 5-oxoproline correlated with cyst 
fluid CEA levels (P<.0001 and P<.05 respectively). For diagnosing malignant 
pancreatic cysts, the diagnostic accuracies of cyst size > 3 cm, ≥ 1 high-risk 
features, cyst fluid CEA, and cytology are 38%, 75%, 80%, and 75%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: (Iso)-butyrylcarnitine has potential clinical application for 
accurately distinguishing malignant from benign pancreatic cysts, and 
5-oxoproline for distinguishing mucinous from non-mucinous cysts.
