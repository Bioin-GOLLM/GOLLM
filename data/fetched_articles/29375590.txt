Mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek var. radiata] is an important grain 
legume globally, providing a high-quality plant protein source largely produced 
and consumed in South and East Asia. This study aimed to characterize a mungbean 
diversity panel consisting of 466 cultivated accessions and demonstrate its 
utility by conducting a pilot genome-wide association study of seed coat color. 
In addition 16 wild accessions were genotyped for comparison and in total over 
22,000 polymorphic genome-wide SNPs were identified and used to analyze the 
genetic diversity, population structure, linkage disequilibrium (LD) of 
mungbean. Polymorphism was lower in the cultivated accessions in comparison to 
the wild accessions, with average polymorphism information content values 0.174, 
versus 0.305 in wild mungbean. LD decayed in ∼100 kb in cultivated lines, a 
distance higher than the linkage decay of ∼60 kb estimated in wild mungbean. 
Four distinct subgroups were identified within the cultivated lines, which 
broadly corresponded to geographic origin and seed characteristics. In a pilot 
genome-wide association mapping study of seed coat color, five genomic regions 
associated were identified, two of which were close to seed coat color genes in 
other species. This mungbean diversity panel constitutes a valuable resource for 
genetic dissection of important agronomical traits to accelerate mungbean 
breeding.
