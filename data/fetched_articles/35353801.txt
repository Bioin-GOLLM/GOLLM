OBJECTIVE: T helper 17 (Th17) pathway has been reported to be abnormal in 
schizophrenia; however, it is not known whether variation within genes of this 
pathway has any impact on schizophrenia. Herein, the impact of genetic 
variations and gene-gene interactions of Th17 pathway-related genes on the risk, 
psychopathology, and brain volume was examined in schizophrenia patients.
METHODS: Functional polymorphisms within interleukin 6 ( IL6 )(rs1800795 and 
rs1800797), IL10 (rs1800872 and rs1800896), IL17A (rs2275913 and rs8193036), 
IL22 (rs2227484 and rs2227485), IL23R (rs1884444), and IL27 (rs153109 and 
rs181206) genes were studied in 224 schizophrenia patients and 226 healthy 
controls. These variants were correlated with the brain morphometry, analyzed 
using MRI in a subset of patients ( n = 117) and controls ( n = 137).
RESULTS: Patients carrying CC genotype of rs2227484 of IL22 gene had 
significantly higher apathy total score [ F (1,183) = 5.60; P = 0.019; partial ɳ 
2 = 0.030]. Significant epistatic interactions between IL6 (rs1800797) and IL17A 
(rs2275913) genes were observed in schizophrenia patients. GG genotype of 
rs2275913 of IL17A gene was associated with reduced right middle occipital gyrus 
volume in schizophrenia patients ( T = 4.56; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Interactions between genes of Th17 pathway impact the risk for 
schizophrenia. The variants of Th17 pathway-related genes seem to have a 
determining effect on psychopathology and brain morphometric changes in 
schizophrenia.
