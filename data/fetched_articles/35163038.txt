Gut microbiota encompasses a wide variety of commensal microorganisms consisting 
of trillions of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This microbial population coexists 
in symbiosis with the host, and related metabolites have profound effects on 
human health. In this respect, gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the 
regulation of metabolic, endocrine, and immune functions. Bacterial metabolites 
include the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate (C2), propionate (C3), and 
butyrate (C4), which are the most abundant SCFAs in the human body and the most 
abundant anions in the colon. SCFAs are made from fermentation of dietary fiber 
and resistant starch in the gut. They modulate several metabolic pathways and 
are involved in obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Thus, diet 
might influence gut microbiota composition and activity, SCFAs production, and 
metabolic effects. In this narrative review, we discuss the relevant research 
focusing on the relationship between gut microbiota, SCFAs, and glucose 
metabolism.
