OBJECTIVE: This research was designed to assess the influence of the 
administration of a lithogenic diet, hydrogen peroxide, and vitamin AD3E on 
rabbits' gallstone formation and to envisage the expression of osteopontin (OPN) 
in their hepatic tissues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four healthy local mature rabbits of both genders 
were divided into four equal groups. At the end of the feeding period, samples 
of blood were taken from all rabbits after they had fasted overnight to estimate 
the serum lipid profile. And some of the hepatic tissue has been preserved at 
-28°C for molecular analysis and gene expression.
RESULTS: The gallstones were formed 100% in the GIII and 50% in the GIV. The 
mRNA OPN expression showed a significant increase in the GIII when compared with 
other groups. In Groups III and II, the serum levels of total cholesterol, 
Triglyceride, L-C, low-density lipoprotein-choles, and VLDL-C were significantly 
increased when compared with GI, while in GIII, the serum level of high-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol was significantly decreased when compared with GI.
CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the expression of the mRNA OPN was increased 
in the hepatic tissue of gallstone-formed rabbits.
