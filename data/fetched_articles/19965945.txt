Genetic polymorphisms in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and 
nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase p22phox are linked 
with the expression and/or progression of vascular disease. We hypothesized that 
these polymorphisms may influence the development and/or progression of systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE), given their linkage with vascular disease. DNA from 
patients with SLE (n = 90) and their age- and sex-matched controls (n = 86) from 
The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University was assessed for eNOS 
and NADPH oxidase p22phox polymorphisms. These polymorphisms were examined by 
restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction. The allele 
frequency of the NADPH oxidase p22phox gene C242T polymorphisms significantly 
varied between the SLE patients and the controls. We found no association of the 
eNOS polymorphism with the development of renal disease. These results indicated 
that the etiology of patients with SLE is associated with NADPH oxidase p22phox 
gene C242T polymorphisms. There was no significant increased risk of SLE 
associated with eNOS polymorphisms in the Chinese population.
