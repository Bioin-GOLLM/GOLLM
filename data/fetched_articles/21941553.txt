The disturbance of apoptosis molecular signaling pathways is involved in 
carcinogenesis. BCL2 family of proteins is the hallmark of apoptosis regulation. 
In the last decade, new members of BCL2 gene family were discovered and cloned 
and were found to be differentially expressed in many types of cancer. BCL2 
protein family, through its role in regulation of apoptotic pathways, is 
possibly related to cancer pathophysiology and resistance to conventional 
chemotherapy. It is well known that leukemias are haematopoietic malignancies 
characterized by biological diversity, varied cytogenetics, different 
immunophenotype profiles, and diverse outcome. Current research focuses on the 
prognostic impact and specific role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of 
leukemias. The understanding of the molecular pathways that participate in the 
biology of leukemias may lead to the design of new therapies which may improve 
patients' survival. In the present paper, we describe current knowledge on the 
role of BCL2 apoptosis regulator proteins in acute and chronic leukemias.
