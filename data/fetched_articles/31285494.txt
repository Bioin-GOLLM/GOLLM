The multi-subunit C-terminal to LisH (CTLH) complex is the mammalian homologue 
of the yeast Gid E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In this study, we investigated the 
human CTLH complex and characterized its E3 ligase activity. We confirm that the 
complex immunoprecipitated from human cells comprises RanBPM, ARMC8 α/β, 
muskelin, WDR26, GID4 and the RING domain proteins RMND5A and MAEA. We find that 
loss of expression of individual subunits compromises the stability of other 
complex members and that MAEA and RMND5A protein levels are interdependent. 
Using in vitro ubiquitination assays, we demonstrate that the CTLH complex has 
E3 ligase activity which is dependent on RMND5A and MAEA. We report that the 
complex can pair with UBE2D1, UBE2D2 and UBE2D3 E2 enzymes and that recombinant 
RMND5A mediates K48 and K63 poly-ubiquitin chains. Finally, we show a 
proteasome-dependent increase in the protein levels of CTLH complex member 
muskelin in RMND5A KO cells. Furthermore, muskelin ubiquitination is dependent 
on RMND5A, suggesting that it may be a target of the complex. Overall, we 
further the characterization of the CTLH complex as an E3 ubiquitin ligase 
complex in human cells and reveal a potential autoregulation mechanism.
