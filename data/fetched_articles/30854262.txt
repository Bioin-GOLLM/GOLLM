PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights recent findings regarding genetics of 
coronary artery calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis 
burden, that is a precursor of clinical coronary artery disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: CAC quantity is heritable. Genome wide association studies of 
common single nucleotide polymorphisms have identified genomic regions 
explaining ~2.4% of CAC heritability. Low frequency and rare variants explain 
additional variation in CAC. Evidence suggests that there may be different 
genetic etiologies for variation in CAC progression than for cross-sectional 
measures of CAC. Studies integrating multiple -omics data are providing new 
insights into the pathobiology of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.
SUMMARY: The future is promising for innovative studies utilizing whole genome 
sequencing data as well as other -omics such as epigenomic modifications of 
genes and gene expression. These studies may provide multiple sources of data 
pointing to the same gene or pathway, thus providing greater confidence in 
findings.
