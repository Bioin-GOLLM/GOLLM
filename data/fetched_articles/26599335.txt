The multikinase inhibitor regorafenib (BAY 73-4506) exerts both anti-angiogenic 
and anti-tumorigenic activity in adult solid malignancies mainly advanced 
colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We intended to explore 
preclinically the potential of regorafenib against solid pediatric malignancies 
alone and in combination with anticancer agents to guide the pediatric 
development plan. In vitro effects on cell proliferation were screened against 
33 solid tumor cell lines of the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer 
(ITCC) panel covering five pediatric solid malignancies. Regorafenib inhibited 
cell proliferation with a mean half maximal growth inhibition of 12.5 μmol/L 
(range 0.7 μmol/L to 28 μmol/L). In vivo, regorafenib was evaluated alone at 10 
or 30 mg/kg/d or in combination with radiation, irinotecan or the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor refametinib against 
various tumor types, including patient-derived brain tumor models with an 
amplified platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) gene. Regorafenib 
alone significantly inhibited tumor growth in all xenografts derived from 
nervous system and connective tissue tumors. Enhanced effects were observed when 
regorafenib was combined with irradiation and irinotecan against PDGFRA 
amplified IGRG93 glioma and IGRM57 medulloblastoma respectively, resulting in 
100% tumor regressions. Antitumor activity was associated with decreased tumor 
vascularization, inhibition of PDGFR signaling, and induction of apoptotic cell 
death. Our work demonstrates that regorafenib exhibits significant antitumor 
activity in a wide spectrum of preclinical pediatric models through inhibition 
of angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, radio- and 
chemosensitizing effects were observed with DNA damaging agents in PDGFR 
amplified tumors.
