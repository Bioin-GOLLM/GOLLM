Abnormal tumor vessels promote metastasis and impair chemotherapy. Hence, tumor 
vessel normalization (TVN) is emerging as an anti-cancer treatment. Here, we 
show that tumor endothelial cells (ECs) have a hyper-glycolytic metabolism, 
shunting intermediates to nucleotide synthesis. EC haplo-deficiency or blockade 
of the glycolytic activator PFKFB3 did not affect tumor growth, but reduced 
cancer cell invasion, intravasation, and metastasis by normalizing tumor 
vessels, which improved vessel maturation and perfusion. Mechanistically, PFKFB3 
inhibition tightened the vascular barrier by reducing VE-cadherin endocytosis in 
ECs, and rendering pericytes more quiescent and adhesive (via upregulation of 
N-cadherin) through glycolysis reduction; it also lowered the expression of 
cancer cell adhesion molecules in ECs by decreasing NF-κB signaling. 
PFKFB3-blockade treatment also improved chemotherapy of primary and metastatic 
tumors.
