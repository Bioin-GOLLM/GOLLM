BACKGROUND/AIMS: Mutations of desmosomal genes are known to cause arrhythmogenic 
cardiomyopathy characterized by arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. 
Previously, we described a novel genetic variant H1684R in desmoplakin gene 
(DSP), associated with a progressive cardiac conduction disease (PCCD). In the 
present study, we aimed to investigate an effect of the DSP-H1684R genetic 
variant on the activity of ion channels.
METHODS: We used cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSC cardiomyocytes) from a patient with DSP-H1684R genetic variant and from 
two healthy donors. Immunofluorescent staining and western blot analyses were 
used to characterize patient-specific cardiomyocytes. By the whole-cell 
voltage-clamp technique we estimated the activity of voltage-gated sodium, 
calcium, and potassium channels that are responsible for action potential 
generation and its shape. Action potentials' parameters were measured using 
whole-cell current-clamp technique.
RESULTS: In patient-specific cardiomyocytes we observed both lower amplitudes of 
currents through sodium Nav1.5 channels and L-type calcium channels, but higher 
amplitude of current through transient-outward potassium channels in comparison 
to donor cardiomyocytes. Current-clamp measurements revealed shortening of 
action-potential in DSP-H1684R-carrying iPSC cardiomyocytes. Therefore, observed 
alterations in the channels activity might have a great impact on the properties 
of action potential and development of PCCD.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that desmoplakin genetic variants, besides 
conduction slowing caused by structural heart remodeling, could affect multiple 
ion channel activity aggravating arrhythmia manifestation in PCCD.
