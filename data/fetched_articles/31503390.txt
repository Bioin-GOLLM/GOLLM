AIM: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the intermediate filament protein 
expressed in astrocytes, plays a key role in many aspects of brain function 
through communication with neurons or blood vessels. A common single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP), GFAP -250 C/A (rs2070935), is associated with the 
transcriptional regulation of GFAP, which can potentially result in the 
genotype-specific brain structure. This study aimed to verify the biological 
effects of the GFAP variants on brain structure and function.
METHODS: We investigated the associations between the GFAP variants and magnetic 
resonance imaging findings, including gray and white matter volumes, white 
matter integrity, and resting arterial blood flow, from 1212 healthy Japanese 
subjects.
RESULTS: The GFAP -250 C/A genotype was significantly associated with total gray 
matter volume, total white matter volume, average mean diffusivity, and mean 
cerebral blood flow. In voxel-by-voxel analyses, the GFAP genotype showed 
significant associations with the regional gray and white matter volumes in the 
inferior frontal lobe and corpus callosum, the regional mean diffusivity in the 
left posterior region, and the regional cerebral blood flow throughout the 
brain.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed a common SNP that is significantly associated 
with multiple global brain structure parameters.
