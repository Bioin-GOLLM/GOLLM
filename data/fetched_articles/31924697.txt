INTRODUCTION: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has identified de novo variants in 
chromatin remodelling genes in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). 
We report on a novel genetic discovery in chromatin remodelling in patients with 
NDD who also have corpus callosum (CC) anomalies.
OBJECTIVE: To discover novel genes linked to both CC anomalies and NDD.
METHODS: Clinical WES was performed for evaluation of NDD, identifying five 
patients with de novo variants in SUPT16H, a subunit of the FACT (facilitates 
chromatin transcription) complex. The clinical phenotypes, genetic results and 
brain MRIs were obtained and systematically reviewed. In silico protein function 
predictions were assessed and allele frequencies in control populations were 
compared.
RESULTS: We identified four patients with de novo missense variants in SUPT16H 
and one patient with a de novo deletion including SUPT16H. These variants were 
not reported in the updated Genome Aggregation Database. When assayable, all 
protein products were predicted to be damaging. Symptoms included intellectual 
disability, autistic features, minor dysmorphic features and seizures. Anomalies 
of the CC were seen in all three patients with available brain imaging.
CONCLUSION: Our findings implicate the gene SUPT16H in a novel disorder 
characterised by neurodevelopmental deficits and CC anomalies.
