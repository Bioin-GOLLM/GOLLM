FOXP3 is the lineage-defining transcription factor of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T 
cells. While many aspects of its regulation, interaction, and function are 
conserved among species, alternatively spliced FOXP3 isoforms are expressed only 
in human cells. This review summarizes current knowledge about alternative 
splicing of FOXP3 and the specific functions of FOXP3 isoforms in health and 
disease. Future perspectives in research and the therapeutic potential of 
manipulating alternative splicing of FOXP3 are discussed.
