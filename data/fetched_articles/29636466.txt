Despite anti-TNF therapy advancements for inflammatory diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, the burden of diseases remains high. An 11-mer TNF 
peptide, TNF70-80, is known to stimulate selective functional responses compared 
to the parent TNF molecule. Here, we show that TNF70-80 binds to the TNF 
receptor, activating p38 MAP kinase through TNF receptor-associated factor 2. 
Using truncated TNFR mutants, we identify the sequence in TNFRI which enables 
p38 activation by TNF70-80. Peptides with this TNFRI sequence, such as 
TNFRI206-211 bind to TNF and inhibit TNF-induced p38 activation, respiratory 
burst, cytokine production and adhesion receptor expression but not 
F-Met-Leu-Phe-induced respiratory burst in neutrophils. TNFRI206-211 does not 
prevent TNF binding to TNFRI or TNF-induced stimulation of ERK, JNK and NF-κB. 
TNFRI206-211 inhibits bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced peritonitis, 
carrageenan-induced and antigen-induced paw inflammation, and respiratory 
syncytial virus-induced lung inflammation in mice. Our findings suggest a way of 
targeting TNF-p38 pathway to treat chronic inflammatory disorders.
