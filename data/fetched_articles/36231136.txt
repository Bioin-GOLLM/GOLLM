The multifunctional protein, voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), is 
located on the mitochondrial outer membrane. It is a pivotal protein that 
maintains mitochondrial function to power cellular bioactivities via energy 
generation. VDAC1 is involved in regulating energy production, mitochondrial 
oxidase stress, Ca2+ transportation, substance metabolism, apoptosis, 
mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), and many other functions. VDAC1 malfunction 
is associated with mitochondrial disorders that affect inflammatory responses, 
resulting in an up-regulation of the body's defensive response to stress 
stimulation. Overresponses to inflammation may cause chronic diseases. 
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) acts as a danger signal that can further trigger 
native immune system activities after its secretion. VDAC1 mediates the release 
of mtDNA into the cytoplasm to enhance cytokine levels by activating immune 
responses. VDAC1 regulates mitochondrial Ca2+ transportation, lipid metabolism 
and mitophagy, which are involved in inflammation-related disease pathogenesis. 
Many scientists have suggested approaches to deal with inflammation overresponse 
issues via specific targeting therapies. Due to the broad functionality of 
VDAC1, it may become a useful target for therapy in inflammation-related 
diseases. The mechanisms of VDAC1 and its role in inflammation require further 
exploration. We comprehensively and systematically summarized the role of VDAC1 
in the inflammatory response, and hope that our research will lead to novel 
therapeutic strategies that target VDAC1 in order to treat inflammation-related 
disorders.
