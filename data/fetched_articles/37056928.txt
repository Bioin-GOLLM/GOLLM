Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays an essential role in mitophagy. Emerging 
evidence indicates that mitophagy is involved in various processes closely 
related to immune diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Here, 
the authors show that Parkin increases the occurrence of colitis and severe 
inflammation. Deletion of Parkin resulted in marked reductions in colonic 
inflammation and exhibited high resistance to DSS-induced colitis. Mechanism 
investigation indicated that Parkin interacts with Vitamin D receptors (VDR), a 
critical inhibitory regulator in IBD. Parkin promotes VDR degradation via the 
p62-related autophagy-lysosome pathway. Comparison of colitis in Parkin-/- and 
Parkin-/-Vdr-/- mice showed that the protective effect of Parkin deletion 
against colitis was abolished by VDR deletion. The result suggests that the 
regulatory effect of Parkin in colitis is a VDR-dependent pathway. Our research 
provides a new role of Parkin in colitis by downregulating VDR, which provides a 
potential strategy for treating IBD.
