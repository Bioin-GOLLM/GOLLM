Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases (TrpRSs) catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNA(Trp). 
Previously, I demonstrated that Zn(2+)-depleted human TrpRS is enzymatically 
inactive and that binding of Zn(2+) or heme to human TrpRS stimulates its 
aminoacylation activity. In the present study, bovine and mouse TrpRSs were 
found to be constitutively active regardless of the presence of Zn(2+) or 
ferriprotoporphyrin IX chloride. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the 
human H130R mutant is constitutively active and that the bovine R135H, E438A 
double mutant binds with Zn(2+) or heme to enhance its aminoacylation activity 
as does human wild-type TrpRS. These results provide the first evidence of 
species-specific regulation of TrpRS activity.
