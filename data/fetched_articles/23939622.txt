The ability to precisely modify endogenous genes can significantly facilitate 
biological studies and disease treatment, and the clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems have the potential to be 
powerful tools for genome engineering. However, the target specificity of CRISPR 
systems is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 systems 
targeting the human hemoglobin β and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 genes have 
substantial off-target cleavage, especially within the hemoglobin δ and C-C 
chemokine receptor type 2 genes, respectively, causing gross chromosomal 
deletions. The guide strands of the CRISPR/Cas9 systems were designed to have a 
range of mismatches with the sequences of potential off-target sites. Off-target 
analysis was performed using the T7 endonuclease I mutation detection assay and 
Sanger sequencing. We found that the repair of the on-and off-target cleavage 
resulted in a wide variety of insertions, deletions and point mutations. 
Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9 systems need to be carefully designed to avoid potential 
off-target cleavage sites, including those with mismatches to the 12-bases 
proximal to the guide strand protospacer-adjacent motif.
