Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at a 20-fold increased risk for acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Compared to children with ALL and no DS 
(non-DS-ALL), those with DS and ALL (DS-ALL) harbor uncommon genetic 
alterations, suggesting DS-ALL could have distinct biological features. Recent 
studies have implicated several genes on chromosome 21 in DS-ALL, but the 
precise mechanisms predisposing children with DS to ALL remain unknown. Our 
integrated genetic/epigenetic analysis revealed that DS-ALL was highly 
heterogeneous with many subtypes. Although each subtype had genetic/epigenetic 
profiles similar to those found in non-DS-ALL, the subtype distribution differed 
significantly between groups. The Philadelphia chromosome-like subtype, a 
high-risk B-cell lineage variant relatively rare among the entire pediatric ALL 
population, was the most common form in DS-ALL. Hypermethylation of RUNX1 on 
chromosome 21 was also found in DS-ALL, but not non-DS-ALL. RUNX1 is essential 
for differentiation of blood cells, especially B cells; thus, hypermethylation 
of the RUNX1 promoter in B-cell precursors might be associated with increased 
incidence of B-cell precursor ALL in DS patients.
