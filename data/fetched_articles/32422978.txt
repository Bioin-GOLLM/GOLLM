In this study, we investigated the functional role of isoprenylcysteine carboxyl 
methyltransferase (ICMT) and its methylatable substrate Ras in Toll-like 
receptor (TLR)-activated macrophages and in mouse inflammatory disease 
conditions. ICMT and RAS expressions were strongly increased in macrophages 
under the activation conditions of TLRs by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a TLR4 
ligand), pam3CSK (TLR2), or poly(I:C) (TLR3) and in the colons, stomachs, and 
livers of mice with colitis, gastritis, and hepatitis. The inhibition and 
activation of ICMT and Ras through genetic and pharmacological approaches 
significantly affected the activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
kinase (IRAK)s, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), 
transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK), and MAPK kinases (MAPKKs); translocation of the AP-1 
family; and the expressions of inflammation-related genes that depend on both 
MyD88 and TRIF. Interestingly, the Ras/ICMT-mediated inflammatory reaction 
critically depends on the TIR domains of myeloid differentiation primary 
response 88 (MyD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β 
(TRIF). Taken together, these results suggest that ICMT and its methylated Ras 
play important roles in the regulation of inflammatory responses through 
cooperation with the TIR domain of adaptor molecules.
