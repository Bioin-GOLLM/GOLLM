Nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 2 (NSD2) is a histone H3 lysine 36 
(H3K36)-specific methyltransferase enzyme that is overexpressed in a number of 
cancers, including multiple myeloma. NSD2 binds to S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) 
and nucleosome substrates to catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from SAM to 
the Îµ-amino group of histone H3K36. Equilibrium binding isotope effects and 
density functional theory calculations indicate that the SAM methyl group is 
sterically constrained in complex with NSD2, and that this steric constraint is 
released upon nucleosome binding. Together, these results show that nucleosome 
binding to NSD2 induces a significant change in the chemical environment of 
enzyme-bound SAM.
