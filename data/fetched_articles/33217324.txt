Currently an in vitro model that fully recapitulates the human embryonic gonad 
is lacking. Here we describe a fully defined feeder-free protocol to generate 
early testis-like cells with the ability to be cultured as an organoid, from 
human induced pluripotent stem cells. This stepwise approach uses small 
molecules to mimic embryonic development, with upregulation of bipotential gonad 
markers (LHX9, EMX2, GATA4, and WT1) at day 10 of culture, followed by induction 
of testis Sertoli cell markers (SOX9, WT1, and AMH) by day 15. Aggregation into 
3D structures and extended culture on Transwell filters yielded organoids with 
defined tissue structures and distinct Sertoli cell marker expression. These 
studies provide insight into human gonadal development, suggesting that a 
population of precursor cells may originate from a more lateral region of the 
mesoderm. Our protocol represents a significant advance toward generating a 
much-needed human gonad organoid for studying disorders/differences of sex 
development.
