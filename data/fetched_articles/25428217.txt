Defects of the platelet P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R) for adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 
are associated with increased bleeding risk. The study of molecular 
abnormalities associated with inherited qualitative defects of the P2Y12R 
protein is useful to unravel structure-function relationships of the receptor. 
We describe the case of 2 brothers, sons of first cousins, with lifelong history 
of abnormal bleeding, associated with dysfunctional P2Y12R and a previously 
undescribed missense mutation in the encoding gene. ADP (4-20 µM)-induced 
aggregation of patients' platelets was markedly reduced and rapidly reversible. 
Other agonists induced borderline-normal aggregation. Inhibition of 
vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation and prostaglandin 
E1-induced increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by ADP was 
impaired, whereas inhibition of cAMP increase by epinephrine was normal. 
[(3)H]PSB-0413, a selective P2Y12R antagonist, bound to a normal number of 
binding sites; however, its affinity, and that of the agonists ADP and 
2-methylthio-adenosine-5'-diphosphate, was reduced. Patients' DNA showed a 
homozygous c.847T>A substitution that changed the codon for His-187 to Gln 
(p.His187Gln). Crystallographic data and molecular modeling studies indicated 
that His187 in transmembrane 5 is important for agonist and nucleotide 
antagonist binding and located in a region undergoing conformational changes. 
These studies delineate a region of P2Y12R required for normal function after 
ADP binding.
