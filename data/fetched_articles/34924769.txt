BACKGROUND: Integrin beta4 (ITGB4) is a transmembrane receptor that plays a key 
role in tumorigenesis and tumor development. However, there are no pan-cancer 
analyses of ITGB4.
METHODS: This study demonstrates the first potential oncogenic roles of ITGB4 
across 33 tumors based on the dataset of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO).
RESULTS: ITGB4 is highly expressed in many cancers, and distinct correlations 
exist between ITGB4 expression and the prognosis of tumor patients. We also 
found that the methylation and genetic alteration level of ITGB4 was associated 
with some cancer prognosis. Furthermore, we found a reduced phosphorylation of 
ITGB4 at S1457 in several tumors, such as breast and ovarian cancers. Finally, 
ITGB4 expression was correlated with cancer-associated fibroblasts in liver 
hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate adenocarcinoma, and the infiltration level 
of NK cells and neutrophils was observed in other cancers, such as breast 
invasive carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, RNA metabolism and protein 
processing-associated functions are involved in the functional mechanism of 
ITGB4.
CONCLUSION: Our first pan-cancer study may offer a relatively comprehensive 
understanding of the oncogenic roles of ITGB4 across different tumors.
