The Diamondback Moth (Plutella xylostella) is a highly destructive lepidopteran 
pest of cruciferous crops. However, there still is relatively little known about 
the locomotor activities of diel and the circadian patterns in P. xylostella. 
Here, we present an analysis of the diel locomotion of P. xylostella under 
several laboratory settings. We established a system for measuring the 
individual locomotor activities of P. xylostella and found that both males and 
females showed a nocturnal pattern of activity under 26 or 20 °C LD conditions, 
with activity peaking immediately after lights off and quickly declining after 
lights on. In addition, we showed that it is difficult to assess the 
free-running circadian rhythms of P. xylostella under 26 °C DD conditions. 
However, we found that males showed a higher power, rhythm index (RI) and 
rhythmic ratio than females under 20 °C DD conditions, which indicated that 
males in low-temperature conditions are much more suitable to study the 
free-running circadian rhythms of P. xylostella. The findings of this study will 
help us to have a better understanding of the diel activity of P. xylostella and 
may provide a foundation for the development of an effective pest management 
strategy.
