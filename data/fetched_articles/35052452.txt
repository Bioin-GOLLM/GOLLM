BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an acute disease condition 
with a high risk of rapid deteriorations. We analysed the influence of genetics 
on cytokine regulation to obtain a better understanding of patient's 
heterogeneity.
METHODS: For up to N = 389 genotyped participants of the PROGRESS study of 
hospitalised CAP patients, we performed a genome-wide association study of ten 
cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, MCP-1 (MCAF), MIP-1α (CCL3), VEGF, 
VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Consecutive secondary analyses were performed to identify 
independent hits and corresponding causal variants.
RESULTS: 102 SNPs from 14 loci showed genome-wide significant associations with 
five of the cytokines. The most interesting associations were found at 6p21.1 
for VEGF (p = 1.58 × 10-20), at 17q21.32 (p = 1.51 × 10-9) and at 10p12.1 (p = 
2.76 × 10-9) for IL-1β, at 10p13 for MIP-1α (CCL3) (p = 2.28 × 10-9), and at 
9q34.12 for IL-10 (p = 4.52 × 10-8). Functionally plausible genes could be 
assigned to the majority of loci including genes involved in cytokine secretion, 
granulocyte function, and cilial kinetics.
CONCLUSION: This is the first context-specific genetic association study of 
blood cytokine concentrations in CAP patients revealing numerous biologically 
plausible candidate genes. Two of the loci were also associated with 
atherosclerosis with probable common or consecutive pathomechanisms.
