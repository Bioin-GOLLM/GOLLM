The aim of this study was to assess the possible circulation of genetic 
resistance determinants and chromosomal point mutations in quinolone-resistant 
Escherichia coli isolated from livestock from central Italy. Forty-nine E. coli 
isolates were recovered from animals during the surveillance activities of the 
Istituto Zooprofilattico Abruzzo e Molise (IZSA&M), Italy, over 2 years. The 
plasmid resistance determinants and point mutations in DNA gyrase and 
topoisomerase IV were characterized by PCR and DNA sequencing. Of the 49 E. coli 
isolates, 34 were resistant to nalidixic acid, 4 to ciprofloxacin and 11 to 
nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin. Chromosomal point mutations were 
found in gyrA gene (Ser83Leu and Asp87Asn) and gyrB (Gln434His, Lys444Arg and 
Gly435Val). We also report the simultaneous presence of qnrS1 quinolone 
resistance determinant, dfrA1-aadA22 gene cassettes and amino acid substitution 
Ser83Leu in the gyrA gene in an E. coli strain resistant only to nalidixic acid.
