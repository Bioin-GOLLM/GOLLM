PURPOSE: To investigate the genetic and clinical features of a Chinese family 
exhibiting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of lissencephaly.
METHODS: Clinical examinations and cranial imaging studies were performed for 
all members of the family (two unaffected members and three surviving members 
from a total of four affected members). In addition, whole-exome sequencing 
analysis was performed for DNA from an affected patient to scan for candidate 
mutations, followed by Sanger sequencing to verify these candidate mutations in 
the entire family. A total of 200 ethnicity-matched healthy controls without 
neuropsychiatric disorder were also included and analyzed.
RESULTS: We identified a novel missense mutation, c.412G > A, p.(E138K), that 
cosegregated with the disease in exon 6 of the platelet activating factor 
acetylhydrolase 1b regulatory subunit 1 (PAFAH1B1) gene in the affected members; 
this mutation was not found in the 200 controls. Multiple sequence alignments 
showed that codon 138, where the mutation (c.G412A) occurred, was located within 
a phylogenetically conserved region. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed 
calcification within the bilateral globus pallidus in all three affected 
members.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel missense mutation, c.412G > A, p.(E138K),in 
the PAFAH1B1 gene of a Chinese family with lissencephaly. In addition, our 
findings suggest that basal ganglia calcification is a novel clinical feature of 
PAFAH1B1-related lissencephaly.
