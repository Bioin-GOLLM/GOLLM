BACKGROUND: Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), 
which is characterized as asthenoteratospermia involving absent, short, bent, 
coiled, and/or irregular-caliber flagella, is a rare recessive inherited 
disorder associated with male infertility. To date, genetic causes of MMAF cases 
are not fully explored.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was conducted to identify pathogenic variants in 
a patient with MMAF. The functional effect of the identified mutations was 
investigated by immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. 
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection was used to assist fertilization for the 
patient with MMAF.
RESULTS: We identified novel biallelic mutations, a splicing variant 
NC_000004.12:g.146937593C>T (c.254+1G>A), and a nonsense mutation 
NM_001300761.4:c.1185C>G (NP_001287690.1:p.Tyr395*), in TTC29 from an infertile 
patient. In addition to the typical MMAF phenotype, the patient also presented 
aberrant morphology of sperm heads. Further functional experiments confirmed the 
absence of TTC29 expression in the spermatozoa. We also explored the specific 
expression pattern of TTC29 in human and mouse spermatogenesis. The outcome of 
intracytoplasmic sperm injection in the patient was unsuccessful, while 
additional female risk factors should not be excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the novel biallelic mutations in TTC29 in a MMAF 
patient, which findings expand the mutational spectrum of TTC29 and further 
contribute to the diagnosis, genetic counseling, and prognosis of male 
infertility.
