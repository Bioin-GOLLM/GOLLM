TDP-43 proteinopathy is linked to neurodegenerative diseases that feature 
synaptic loss in the cortex and hippocampus, although it remains unclear how 
TDP-43 regulates mature synapses. We report that, in adult mouse hippocampus, 
TDP-43 knockdown, but not overexpression, induces robust structural and 
functional damage to excitatory synapses, supporting a role for TDP-43 in 
maintaining mature synapses. Dendritic spine loss induced by TDP-43 knockdown is 
rescued by wild-type TDP-43, but not ALS/FTLD-associated mutants, suggesting a 
common TDP-43 functional deficiency in neurodegenerative diseases. 
Interestingly, M337V and A90V mutants also display dominant negative activities 
against WT TDP-43, partially explaining why M337V transgenic mice develop 
hippocampal degeneration similar to that in excitatory neuronal TDP-43 knockout 
mice, and why A90V mutation is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Further 
analyses reveal that a TDP-43 knockdown-induced reduction in GluN2A contributes 
to synaptic loss. Our results show that loss of TDP-43 function underlies 
hippocampal and cortical synaptic degeneration in TDP-43 proteinopathies.
