The maintenance of genome stability is essential to prevent loss of genetic 
information and the development of diseases such as cancer. One of the most 
common forms of damage to the genetic code is the oxidation of DNA by reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), of which 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-guanine (8-oxoG) is the most 
frequent modification. Previous studies have established that human 
single-stranded DNA-binding protein 1 (hSSB1) is essential for the repair of 
double-stranded DNA breaks by the process of homologous recombination. Here we 
show that hSSB1 is also required following oxidative damage. Cells lacking hSSB1 
are sensitive to oxidizing agents, have deficient ATM and p53 activation and 
cannot effectively repair 8-oxoGs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hSSB1 forms 
a complex with the human oxo-guanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) and is important for 
hOGG1 localization to the damaged chromatin. In vitro, hSSB1 binds directly to 
DNA containing 8-oxoguanines and enhances hOGG1 activity. These results underpin 
the crucial role hSSB1 plays as a guardian of the genome.
