The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the HLA 
alleles at the DQA1, DQB1 and DRB1 loci, the CIITA genetic polymorphisms -168A/G 
and +1614G/C, and susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) in a sample from Rio 
de Janeiro State, Brazil. Furthermore, we wished to determine whether any of 
these associations might be more significant in women compared with men. DNA 
samples from 52 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 126 healthy controls 
matched for sex and age were analyzed. We identified a significant 
HLA-DRB1*15:01-MS association that was female-specific (Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.78; 
p = 0.001). Furthermore, we observed that the +1614G/C mutation in combination 
with the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele increased susceptibility to MS in females (OR = 
4.55; p = 0.01). Together, these findings highlight the polygenic nature of MS.
