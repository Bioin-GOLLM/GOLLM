Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is a public health 
concern in the Iranian population, with an incidence of 1 in 166 live births. In 
the present study, the whole exome sequencing (WES) method was applied to 
identify the mutation spectrum of NSHL patients negative for GJB2 gene 
mutations. First, using ARMS PCR followed by Sanger sequencing of the GJB2 gene, 
63.15% of mutations in patients with NSHL were identified. Among the identified 
mutations in GJB2:p.Val43Met and p.Gly21Arg were novel. The remaining patients 
were subjected to WES, which identified novel mutations including 
MYO15A:p.Gly39LeufsTer188, ADGRV1:p.Ser5918ValfsTer23, MYO7A: c.5856+2T>c 
(splicing mutation), FGF3:p.Ser156Cys. The present study emphasized the 
application of WES as an effective method for molecular diagnosis of NSHL 
patients negative for GJB2 gene mutations in the Iranian population.
