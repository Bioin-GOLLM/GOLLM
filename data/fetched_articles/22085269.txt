The risk-benefit ratio for concurrent use of dietary antioxidants with 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy is a controversial topic. In this review, the 
medical literature on concurrent antioxidant use with chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy was assessed and further steps for generating evidence-based 
guidelines are suggested. The clinical cancer research community should 
cooperate and focus new studies on the use of a specific combination of 
antioxidant and chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and determine optimal doses for a 
specific cancer setting. Mechanistic studies on the interaction between 
antioxidants and conventional cancer therapy could lead to novel biomarkers for 
assessing dose adequacy.
