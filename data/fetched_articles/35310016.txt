INTRODUCTION: This study explored the effects and molecular mechanisms of 
asperosaponin VI in tendon disease.
METHODS: Forty-eight purebred adult male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly 
divided into the normal group (normal, n = 8); saline group (saline, n = 8) and 
prostaglandin E2 group (n = 32), which was further divided into four subgroups 
that were treated with asperosaponin VI doses of 0 mg/kg (model, n = 8), 
10 mg/kg (10, n = 8), 20 mg/kg (20, n = 8) and 40 mg/kg (40, n = 8). The 
expression levels of matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1), metallopeptidase 
inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), serpin family E 
member 1 (SERPINE1), collagen Ⅰ (COL1), collagen Ⅲ (COL3) and tenomodulin (TNMD) 
in Achilles tendon tissue were determined through Western blot analysis. The 
histopathological changes in tendon tissue were observed by using Masson 
staining and haematoxylin-eosin staining.
RESULTS: The expression levels of MMP1, TIMP1 and COL3 were higher and those of 
TGFB1, SERPINE1, COL1 and TNMD were lower in the 0 mg/kg group than in the 
normal group (P < 0.05). Compared with those in the 0 mg/kg group, the levels of 
MMP1 were lower in the 20 and 40 mg/kg groups. Compared with those in the 
0 mg/kg group, the levels of TIMP1 were lower and the levels of TGFB1, COL1 and 
TNMD were higher in the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg groups. In addition, compared with 
those in other groups, the levels of SERPINE1 in the 40 mg/kg group were 
significantly higher and the levels of COL3 in the 10 and 20 mg/kg groups were 
significantly lower (P < 0.05). Fibrous tissue arrangements and structures in 
the 40 mg/kg group were similar to those in the control group.
CONCLUSION: The effects of asperosaponin VI on injured tendons mainly involve 
eliminating inflammation, restoring balance to extracellular matrix collagen 
metabolism and inducing tendon cell proliferation. Asperosaponin VI is likely to 
be an ideal drug for the prevention and treatment of tendon disease.
