Mutations in VCP (Valosin-containing protein), an AAA ATPase critical for 
ER-associated degradation, are linked to IBMPFD (Inclusion body myopathy with 
Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia). Using a Drosophila IBMPFD model, we 
have identified the ER protein Derlin-1 as a modifier of pathogenic TER94 (the 
fly VCP homolog) mutants. Derlin-1 binds to TER94 directly, and this interaction 
is essential for Derlin-1 overexpression to suppress the pathogenic 
TER94-induced neurodegeneration. Derlin-1 overexpression reduces the elevated 
ATPase activity of pathogenic TER94, implying that IBMPFD is caused by ATPase 
hyper-activation. Under physiological condition, Derlin-1 expression is 
increased upon ER stress to recruit TER94 to the ER. However, in response to 
severe ER stress, Derlin-1 is required for activating apoptosis to eliminate 
damaged cells. This pro-apoptotic response is mimicked by Derlin-1 
overexpression, which elicits acute ER stress and triggers apoptosis via a novel 
C-terminal motif (Î±). As this Derlin-1-dependent cell death is negated by TER94 
overexpression, we propose that while Derlin-1 and VCP work cooperatively in ER 
stress response, their imbalance has a role in removing cells suffering 
prolonged ER stress.
