BACKGROUND: The variation in the reported vaccine safety and effectiveness could 
contribute to the high rates of vaccine hesitancy among the general population 
and healthcare workers in areas where monkeypox (mpox) is circulating. In this 
review, our objective was to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness, 
and efficacy of the mpox vaccines.
METHODS: An extensive search for articles across multiple databases was 
performed, including searching six databases (PubMed Central, PubMed Medline, 
Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest), two pre-print databases (European 
PMC Preprint and MedRxiv), and Google Scholar.
RESULTS: A total of 4290 citations were retrieved from the included databases. 
Following the removal of duplicates and the initial screening of records, a 
total of 36 studies were included into the analysis. Additionally, we identified 
five more studies through manual searches, resulting in a total of 41 eligible 
articles for qualitative synthesis. The study findings revealed that mpox 
vaccines demonstrate the ability to generate adequate antibodies; however, their 
effectiveness may decrease over time, exhibiting varying safety profiles. Most 
of the included studies consistently reported substantial levels of 
effectiveness and efficacy against mpox. Interestingly, the number of vaccine 
doses administered was found to influence the degree of immunogenicity, 
subsequently impacting the overall effectiveness and efficacy of the vaccines. 
Furthermore, we found that smallpox vaccines exhibited a form of 
cross-protection against mpox.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccines can be used to prevent mpox and effectively control its 
spread.
