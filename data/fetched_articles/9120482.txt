We studied a group of 14 patients from Northern Italy with myophosphorylase 
deficiency. The disease presented considerable clinical and biochemical 
heterogeneity, which was reflected at the molecular level. The clinical 
presentation was typical in 3 patients, mild in 7 (exercise intolerance), and 
severe in 4 (fixed weakness). Enzyme activity was undetectable in 10 patients, 
below 3% of control in 3, and 13% of control in one. Enzymatic protein was 
detectable immunologically only in 1 patient. Myophosphorylase mRNA was present 
in 8 patients, but in 7 of them it was reduced in amount. Two patients were 
homozygous for the common nonsense R49X mutation, 5 were heterozygous. Two 
missense mutations not previously observed were identified in this group of 
patients. The frequency of alleles with the R49X mutation was significantly 
lower in this group of patients than in previously reported series. 
Myophosphorylase deficiency is genetically heterogeneous even among patients 
living in a small region and with a common ethnic background.
