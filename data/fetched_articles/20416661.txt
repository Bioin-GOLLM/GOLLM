Searching for effects of candidate gene polymorphisms on fatness traits is an 
important goal for pig industry. In this study we evaluated polymorphism of four 
porcine genes involved in energy metabolism (RETN, UCP1, UCP3 and ADRB3). 
Moreover, their association with fat deposition traits was analyzed in two 
breeds (Polish Landrace, Polish Large White) and a Polish synthetic line (L990). 
Altogether, five SNPs were identified, including two novel ones in the 
5'-flanking region of the RETN gene and a novel missense substitution in the 
UCP3. Distribution of these polymorphisms in the studied five breeds and the 
synthetic line was not uniform. Two of the analyzed SNPs: g.-178G>A in the RETN 
and g.946C>T in the UCP3 gene revealed a significant association with abdominal 
fat weight or backfat thickness. Such associations were not observed for the 
UCP1 or ADRB3 gene polymorphisms. Our study showed that polymorphisms of the 
UCP3 and RETN genes are potentially associated with porcine fatness traits.
