The RNA-binding protein Sam68 is involved in apoptosis, but its cellular mRNA 
targets and its mechanism of action remain unknown. We demonstrate that Sam68 
binds the mRNA for Bcl-x and affects its alternative splicing. Depletion of 
Sam68 by RNA interference caused accumulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L), whereas 
its up-regulation increased the levels of proapoptotic Bcl-x(s). Tyrosine 
phosphorylation of Sam68 by Fyn inverted this effect and favored the Bcl-x(L) 
splice site selection. A point mutation in the RNA-binding domain of Sam68 
influenced its splicing activity and subnuclear localization. Moreover, 
coexpression of ASF/SF2 with Sam68, or fusion with an RS domain, counteracted 
Sam68 splicing activity toward Bcl-x. Finally, Sam68 interacted with 
heterogenous nuclear RNP (hnRNP) A1, and depletion of hnRNP A1 or mutations that 
impair this interaction attenuated Bcl-x(s) splicing. Our results indicate that 
Sam68 plays a role in the regulation of Bcl-x alternative splicing and that 
tyrosine phosphorylation of Sam68 by Src-like kinases can switch its role from 
proapoptotic to antiapoptotic in live cells.
