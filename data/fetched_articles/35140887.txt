Telomeric POT1-TPP1 binding is critical to telomere maintenance and disruption 
of this complex may lead to cancer. Current data suggests a reduction of 
intracellular POT1 levels in the absence of TPP1. Here we provide evidence of 
POT1 plasticity that contributes to its lack of stability in the absence of TPP1 
binding. Structural data reveals inter- and intramolecular POT1C domain 
flexibility in the absence of TPP1. Thermostability and proteolytic resistance 
assays show that POT1C and the mutant complex POT1C(Q623H)-TPP1(PBD) are less 
stable than the wild type POT1C-TPP1(PBD), suggesting that TPP1 binding to POT1 
stabilizes POT1C and makes it less accessible to proteasomal degradation in the 
cell. Disruption of the POT1-TPP1 complex such as through cancer-associated 
mutations leads to a reduction of intracellular POT1, telomere uncapping, and 
telomere associated DNA damage response (DDR). DDR in turn leads to senescence 
or genomic instability and oncogenesis.
