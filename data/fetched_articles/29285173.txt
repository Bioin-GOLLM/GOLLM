Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease that 
varies greatly in its expression. The current study reports a novel case of TSC 
caused by a TSC2 mutation (TSC2c.1642_1643insA or TSC2p.K549fsX589), in which 
multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas were detected by fetal echocardiography in week 31 
of pregnancy. The infant was delivered successfully; however, seizures began 16 
days following birth. Subsequent genetic tests confirmed a diagnosis of TSC. 
Rapamycin treatment resulted in regression of cardiac rhabdomyomas and 
controlled seizures. The current study demonstrates the value of fetal 
echocardiography in the diagnosis of TSC and suggests that inhibition of the 
mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway may be considered as 
a potential antiepileptogenic therapy for neonatal TSC. In addition, it was 
demonstrated that rapamycin treatment was therapeutically beneficial for 
preventing disorders caused by abnormal mTOR signaling, such as cancer. 
According to the literature, cardiac rhabdomyomas, seizures and skin lesions are 
well established markers for TSC in neonates. MRI scans of the brain and genetic 
screening of TSC1 and TSC2 genes may facilitate an early diagnosis of TSC.
