Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal-dominant cancer predisposition 
disorder associated with pathogenic germline variants in TP53, with a high 
penetrance over an individual's lifetime. The actual population prevalence of 
pathogenic germline TP53 mutations is still unclear, most likely due to biased 
selection of cancer affected families. The aim of this study was to estimate the 
population prevalence of potentially pathogenic TP53 exonic variants in three 
sequencing databases, totaling 63,983 unrelated individuals. Potential 
pathogenicity was defined using an original algorithm combining bioinformatic 
prediction tools, suggested clinical significance, and functional data. We 
identified 34 different potentially pathogenic TP53 variants in 131 out of 
63,983 individuals (0.2%). Twenty-eight (82%) of these variants fell within the 
DNA-binding domain of TP53, with an enrichment for specific variants that were 
not previously identified as LFS mutation hotspots, such as the p.R290H and 
p.N235S variants. Our findings reveal that the population prevalence of 
potentially pathogenic TP53 variants may be up to 10 times higher than 
previously estimated from family-based studies. These results point to the need 
for further studies aimed at evaluating cancer penetrance modifiers as well as 
the risk associated between cancer and rare TP53 variants.
