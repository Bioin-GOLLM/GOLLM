Renal diseases in childhood form a spectrum of different conditions with 
potential long-term consequences. Given that, a great effort has been made by 
researchers to identify candidate biomarkers that are able to influence 
diagnosis and prognosis, in particular by using omics techniques (e.g., 
metabolomics, lipidomics, genomics, and transcriptomics). Over the past decades, 
metabolomics has added a promising number of 'new' biomarkers to the 'old' group 
through better physiopathological knowledge, paving the way for insightful 
perspectives on the management of different renal diseases. We aimed to 
summarize the most recent omics evidence in the main renal pediatric diseases 
(including acute renal injury, kidney transplantation, chronic kidney disease, 
renal dysplasia, vesicoureteral reflux, and lithiasis) in this narrative review.
