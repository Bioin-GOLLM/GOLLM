There is increasing acceptance that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
classically considered a neurodegenerative disease affecting almost exclusively 
motor neurons, is syndromic with both clinical and biological heterogeneity. 
This is most evident in its association with a broad range of 
neuropsychological, behavioral, speech and language deficits [collectively 
termed ALS frontotemporal spectrum disorder (ALS-FTSD)]. Although the most 
consistent pathology of ALS and ALS-FTSD is a disturbance in TAR DNA binding 
protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) metabolism, alterations in microtubule-associated tau 
protein (tau) metabolism can also be observed in ALS-FTSD, most prominently as 
pathological phosphorylation at Thr175 (pThr175tau). pThr175 has been shown to 
promote exposure of the phosphatase activating domain (PAD) in the tau 
N-terminus with the consequent activation of GSK3β mediated phosphorylation at 
Thr231 (pThr231tau) leading to pathological oligomer formation. This 
pathological cascade of tau phosphorylation has been observed in chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy with ALS (CTE-ALS) and in both in vivo and in vitro 
experimental paradigms, suggesting that it is of critical relevance to the 
pathobiology of ALS-FTSD. It is also evident that the co-existence of 
alterations in the metabolism of TDP-43 and tau acts synergistically in a rodent 
model to exacerbate the pathology of either.
