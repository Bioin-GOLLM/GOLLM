Identifying disease-associated susceptibility loci is one of the most pressing 
and crucial challenges in modeling complex diseases. Existing approaches to 
biomarker discovery are subject to several limitations including underpowered 
detection, neglect for variant interactions, and restrictive dependence on prior 
biological knowledge. Addressing these challenges necessitates more ingenious 
ways of approaching the "missing heritability" problem. This study aims to 
discover disease-associated susceptibility loci by augmenting previous 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the integration of random forest and 
cluster analysis. The proposed integrated framework is applied to a hepatitis B 
virus surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance GWAS data. Multiple cluster analyses 
were performed on (1) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered 
significant by GWAS and (2) SNPs with the highest feature importance scores 
obtained using random forest. The resulting SNP-sets from the cluster analyses 
were subsequently tested for trait-association. Three susceptibility loci 
possibly associated with HBsAg seroclearance were identified: (1) SNP rs2399971, 
(2) gene LINC00578, and (3) locus 11p15. SNP rs2399971 is a biomarker reported 
in the literature to be significantly associated with HBsAg seroclearance in 
patients who had received antiviral treatment. The latter two loci are linked 
with diseases influenced by the presence of hepatitis B virus infection. These 
findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed integrated framework in 
identifying disease-associated susceptibility loci. With further validation, 
results herein could aid in better understanding complex disease etiologies and 
provide inputs for a more advanced disease risk assessment for patients.
