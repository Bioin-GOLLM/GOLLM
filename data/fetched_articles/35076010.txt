Among 114 clinical Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates collected in Vietnam during 
2019-2020, we detected 15 of subclone sequence type 13871 of the FC428 clonal 
complex. Fourteen sequence type 13871 isolates with mosaic penA allele 60.001 
were ceftriaxone or cefixime nonsusceptible, and 3/14 were azithromycin 
nonsusceptible. Emergence of this subclone threatens treatment effectiveness.
