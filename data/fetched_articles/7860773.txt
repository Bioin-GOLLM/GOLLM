The IL2RG gene encoding the gamma chain of the lymphocyte receptor for IL-2 lies 
in human Xq13.1 and is mutated in males with X-linked severe combined 
immunodeficiency (SCID). In a large Canadian pedigree genetic linkage studies 
demonstrated that the proband's grandmother was the source of an X-linked SCID 
mutation. However, her T cells did not show the expected skewed X chromosome 
inactivation pattern of female carriers of SCID, despite her having one affected 
son and two carrier daughters with skewed X inactivation. Single strand 
conformation polymorphism analysis of IL2RG in the affected proband was abnormal 
in exon 5; sequencing revealed a nine nucleotide in-frame duplication insertion. 
The three duplicated amino acids included the first tryptophan of the "WSXWS" 
motif found in all members of the cytokine receptor gene superfamily. Mutation 
detection in the pedigree confirmed that the founder grandmother's somatic cells 
had only normal IL2RG, and further showed that the SCID-associated X chromosome 
haplotype was inherited by three daughters, one with a wild type IL2RG gene and 
two others with the insertional mutation. Female germ line mosaicism is unusual, 
but its presence in this X-linked SCID family emphasizes the limitations of 
genetic diagnosis by linkage as compared with direct mutation analysis.
