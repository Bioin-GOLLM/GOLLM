Retinoblastoma manifests as ocular malignancy due to mutations in the RB1 gene. 
A 17-month-old girl with bilateral retinoblastoma having no family history was 
admitted to our hospital. The right eye was enucleated but the other was 
preserved with systemic chemotherapy and topical treatment. The patient has been 
tumor-free for over 7 years since diagnosis. All exons of RB1 were sequenced and 
a novel 1-base pair deletion (NM_000321.2:c.2409del, p.Asn803Lysfs*7) was 
detected.
