Interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) dictate cell fates. However, 
the complexity of dense ECM network and cell-surface molecules prevent the study 
of their dynamic interaction at the molecular level on living cells. Here, we 
focus on peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) to dissect prolyl 
isomerization from other dynamic events. We reveal the contribution of PPIase on 
the mechanical properties of various ECM materials and on the dynamic cell-ECM 
interaction. To avoid complications associated with the existing 
spectroscopy-based methods such as light scattering, an assay was developed for 
detecting PPIase activity on living cell surface. This assay allows us to 
correlate PPIase activity with ECM development, and with the physiological and 
pathological states of the cells, including the functional properties of cancer 
cells and immune effector cells.
