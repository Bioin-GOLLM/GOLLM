Carbohydrates play a key role in the biological activity of numerous natural 
products. In many instances their biosynthesis requires radical mediated 
rearrangements, some of which are catalyzed by radical SAM enzymes. BtrN is one 
such enzyme responsible for the dehydrogenation of a secondary alcohol in the 
biosynthesis of 2-deoxystreptamine. DesII is another example that catalyzes a 
deamination reaction necessary for the net C4 deoxygenation of a glucose 
derivative en route to desosamine formation. BtrN and DesII represent the two 
most extensively characterized radical SAM enzymes involved in carbohydrate 
biosynthesis. In this review, we summarize the biosynthetic roles of these two 
enzymes, their mechanisms of catalysis, the questions that have arisen during 
these investigations and the insight they can offer for furthering our 
understanding of radical SAM enzymology. This article is part of a Special Issue 
entitled: Radical SAM enzymes and Radical Enzymology.
