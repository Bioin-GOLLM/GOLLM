OBJECTIVE: Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), which has a vasodilator 
effect, is held responsible for neurogenic inflammation and vasodilatation of 
the cranial vessels in migraine pathophysiology. In this study, we investigated 
the association between alpha CGRP gene polymorphism (CALCA T-692C) and 
migraine.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-four female migraineurs and 96 
healthy female cases were enrolled in the study. The patient group was further 
subdivided into migraine with and without aura groups. The CALCA T-692C gene 
polymorphism was identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and 
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).
RESULTS: The genotype and allele frequencies of CALCA T-692C gene polymorphism 
did not differ between the migraine and control groups. Between the migraine 
with and without aura subgroups, there was no difference. No association was 
seen between the CALCA T-692C gene polymorphisms and migraine attack severity 
and frequency.
CONCLUSION: Our study did not show any association between CALCA T-692C gene 
polymorphism and migraine.
