OBJECTIVE: The MHC region harbors the strongest loci for latent autoimmune 
diabetes in adults (LADA); however, the strength of association is likely 
attenuated compared with that for childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. In this 
study, we recapitulate independent effects in the MHC class I region in a 
population with type 1 diabetes and then determine whether such conditioning in 
LADA yields potential genetic discriminators between the two subtypes within 
this region.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Chromosome 6 was imputed using SNP2HLA, with 
conditional analysis performed in type 1 diabetes case subjects (n = 1,985) and 
control subjects (n = 2,219). The same approach was applied to a LADA cohort (n 
= 1,428) using population-based control subjects (n = 2,850) and in a separate 
replication cohort (656 type 1 diabetes case, 823 LADA case, and 3,218 control 
subjects).
RESULTS: The strongest associations in the MHC class II region (rs3957146, β 
[SE] = 1.44 [0.05]), as well as the independent effect of MHC class I genes, on 
type 1 diabetes risk, particularly HLA-B*39 (β [SE] = 1.36 [0.17]), were 
confirmed. The conditional analysis in LADA versus control subjects showed 
significant association in the MHC class II region (rs3957146, β [SE] = 1.14 
[0.06]); however, we did not observe significant independent effects of MHC 
class I alleles in LADA.
CONCLUSIONS: In LADA, the independent effects of MHC class I observed in type 1 
diabetes were not observed after conditioning on the leading MHC class II 
associations, suggesting that the MHC class I association may be a genetic 
discriminator between LADA and childhood-onset type 1 diabetes.
