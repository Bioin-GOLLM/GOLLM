Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is responsible for transducing the gaseous 
signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) into the ubiquitous secondary signaling 
messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate in eukaryotic organisms. sGC is 
exquisitely tuned to respond to low levels of NO, allowing cells to respond to 
non-toxic levels of NO. In this review, the structure of sGC is discussed in the 
context of sGC activation and deactivation. The sequence of events in the 
activation pathway are described into a comprehensive model of in vivo sGC 
activation as elucidated both from studies with purified enzyme and those done 
in cells. This model is then used to discuss the deactivation of sGC, as well as 
the molecular mechanisms of pathophysiological deactivation.
