BACKGROUND: The single nucleotide polymorphism in the peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC)-1α gene (PPARGC1A) was 
identified to be associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in 
adults. The PPARGC1A gene encodes PGC-1α, which regulates cellular energy 
metabolism.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the hypothesis that the PPARGC1A rs8192678 risk A 
allele would influence the risk of NAFLD in obese children.
DESIGN: We genotyped PPARGC1A rs8192678 and PNPLA3 rs738409 in 781 obese 
children aged 7-18 y. NAFLD was determined by ultrasonography. We evaluated the 
independent influence of the PPARGC1A rs8192678 risk A allele on pediatric NAFLD 
after control for the effect of the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism.
RESULTS: A total of 23.3% of the recruited obese children had NAFLD. PNPLA3 
rs738409 increased the OR of NAFLD by 1.622 (95% CI: 1.071, 2.457; P = 0.023) in 
subjects with GC alleles and 2.659 (95% CI: 1.509, 4.686; P < 0.001) for GG 
alleles, as compared with CC alleles. After control for the effects of age- and 
sex-adjusted BMI, sex, and PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism, the PPARGC1A rs8192678 
risk A allele was an independent risk factor for developing NAFLD, with an OR of 
1.740 (95% CI: 1.149, 2.637; P = 0.009). Subjects with the PPARGC1A rs8192678 
risk A allele had an increase in the mean serum alanine aminotransferase 
concentration of 5.2 IU/L, as compared with subjects without this allele (P = 
0.011).
CONCLUSION: The PPARGC1A rs8192678 risk A allele is associated with an increased 
risk of NAFLD, independent of the effect of the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism in 
our population of obese Taiwanese children.
