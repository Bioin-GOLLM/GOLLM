The incidence of lung cancer is high worldwide, and lung cancer is the leading 
cause of death from malignant tumors in both men and women. Early diagnosis of 
lung cancer can significantly improve the patient's prognosis. Therefore, 
searching for specific markers to assist in the early diagnosis of lung cancer 
is urgent question. Exosomes are nano-sized microvesicles and contain various 
biomaterial, including nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. Exosomes are 
important carriers of these biomaterial, serve important roles in intracellular 
communications and signal transduction among tissues. Due to its unique 
enrichment mechanism, it has the stability and specificity as a biomarker. 
Exosomes are not only involved in the formation of tumor microenvironment and 
new blood vessels in lung cancer, but also involved in chemotherapy, targeted 
therapy response and prognosis assessment. Many research advances bring new hope 
for prolonging the survival of lung cancer patients. This article reviews the 
value of exosome specific protein and microRNA (miRNA) in lung cancer in the 
diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer.

【中文摘要：世界范围内肺癌的发病率居高不下，不论男性还是女性，肺癌均是恶性肿瘤死亡的首位原因。肺癌的早期诊断将显著改善患者的预后，寻找辅助早期肺癌诊断的标志物是当前研究热点。外泌体是由各种细胞分泌的纳米级微囊泡，包含核酸、蛋白质和脂质等多种成分，是细胞间或细胞与组织间信号传递或物质运输的重要载体。独特的富集机制使其具有作为生物标志物的稳定性和特异性。外泌体除参与肺癌肿瘤微环境的形成及新生血管的生成外，还参与化疗、靶向治疗反应及预后评估。诸多研究进展成果为延长肺癌患者生存期带来新的希望。本文就外泌体特异性蛋白和微小RNA（microRNA, 
miRNA）在肺癌发病、诊断及预后评估中的价值进行综述。】 【中文关键词：肺肿瘤；外泌体；诊断；预后；生物标志物】.
