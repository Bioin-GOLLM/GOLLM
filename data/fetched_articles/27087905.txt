BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity, which is a known risk factor for many chronic 
diseases, has also been associated with vitamin D deficiency. This study 
explored the relationship between serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] 
concentrations and adiposity measures in a general Korean population using the 
most recent, nationally representative survey data.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study sample consisted of 4,771 Korean adults (â‰¥ 19 years) 
who participated in the fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Surveys. Serum 25(OH)D was determined by radioimmunoassay. Body mass index 
(BMI), waist circumference (WC) and total body fat content were measured as 
adiposity measurements. Total body fat content was measured by dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry.
RESULTS: The serum 25(OH)D level was significantly higher in men than in women. 
Serum 25(OH)D concentration was positively correlated with energy intake, and it 
was negatively correlated with total body fat content (P < 0.0001) and 
percentage body fat (P < 0.0001) after adjustment for age in both sexes, while 
was inversely correlated with BMI only in women. In multivariable regression 
analysis, serum 25(OH)D was inversely associated with the total body fat content 
after adjustment for age, BMI, education, region, smoking, alcohol consumption, 
physical activity, and energy intake only in men (P = 0.0047). However, the 
serum 25(OH)D concentration was not associated with WC or BMI, indicators of 
adiposity after adjustment for potential risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum 25(OH)D concentration was independently associated with the 
total body fat content in a general Korean population, but it may be not 
associated with the indicators for estimating adiposity, such as WC or BMI.
