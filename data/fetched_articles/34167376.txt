Triose phosphate isomerase deficiency (TPI Df) is an untreatable, 
childhood-onset glycolytic enzymopathy. Patients typically present with frequent 
infections, anemia, and muscle weakness that quickly progresses with severe 
neuromusclar dysfunction requiring aided mobility and often respiratory support. 
Life expectancy after diagnosis is typically ~5 years. There are several 
described pathogenic mutations that encode functional proteins; however, these 
proteins, which include the protein resulting from the "common" TPIE105D 
mutation, are unstable due to active degradation by protein quality control 
(PQC) pathways. Previous work has shown that elevating mutant TPI levels by 
genetic or pharmacological intervention can ameliorate symptoms of TPI Df in 
fruit flies. To identify compounds that increase levels of mutant TPI, we have 
developed a human embryonic kidney (HEK) stable knock-in model expressing the 
common TPI Df protein fused with green fluorescent protein (HEK TPIE105D-GFP). 
To directly address the need for lead TPI Df therapeutics, these cells were 
developed into an optical drug discovery platform that was implemented for 
high-throughput screening (HTS) and validated in 3-day variability tests, 
meeting HTS standards. We initially used this assay to screen the 446-member 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Collection and validated two of the 
hits in dose-response, by limited structure-activity relationship studies with a 
small number of analogs, and in an orthogonal, non-optical assay in patient 
fibroblasts. The data form the basis for a large-scale phenotypic screening 
effort to discover compounds that stabilize TPI as treatments for this 
devastating childhood disease.
