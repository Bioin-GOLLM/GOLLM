BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a clinically and 
genetically heterogeneous disorder. Patients with MCPH exhibit reduced 
occipito-frontal head circumference and non-progressive intellectual disability. 
To date, 17 genes have been known as an underlying cause of MCPH in humans. ASPM 
(abnormal spindle-like, microcephaly associated) is the most commonly mutated 
MCPH gene.
OBJECTIVE: Identify the genetic defect underlying MCPH in a Saudi family.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional clinical genetic study of a Saudi family.
SETTING: Madinah Maternity and Children Hospital and Centre for Genetics and 
Inherited Diseases, Taibah University.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A molecular analysis was carried out on DNA samples from 
10 individuals of a Saudi family segregating MCPH. DNA was isolated from the 
peripheral blood of 10 individuals, including 2 patients, and whole exome 
sequencing was performed using the Nextera Rapid Capture kit and NextSeq500 
instrument. VariantStudio was used to filter and prioritize variants.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Detection of mutation in the ASPM gene in a family 
segregating autoso- mal recessive primary microcephaly.
RESULTS: A novel homozygous splice-site variant (c.3742-1G > C) in the ASPM gene 
was identified. The variant is predicted to have an effect on splicing. Human 
Splice Finder, an in silico tool, predicted skipping of exon 16 due to this 
variant.
CONCLUSION: Skipping of exon 16 may change the order and number of IQ motifs in 
the ASPM protein leading to typical MCPH phenotype.
LIMITATIONS: Single family study.
