We examined folding and secretion of human lysozyme using four mutants each 
lacking two cysteines expressed in a yeast secretion system. Our results have 
revealed that the formation of the disulfide bond Cys6/Cys128 in human lysozyme 
is a prerequisite for correct folding in vivo in yeast. Substitution of Ala for 
Cys77 and Cys95 gave eight-fold greater secretion of a molecule with almost the 
same specific activity as that of the native enzyme. Substitutions of the other 
cysteines gave molecules that were secreted at a lower rate and had lower 
specific activities than the native enzyme. These are the first findings that 
the individual disulfide bonds of human lysozyme have different functions in 
folding and secretion in vivo.
