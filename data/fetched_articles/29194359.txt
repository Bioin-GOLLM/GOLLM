Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus, is recurring in 
epidemic waves. In the past decade and a half, the disease has resurged in 
several countries around the globe, with outbreaks becoming increasingly severe. 
Though CHIKV was first isolated in 1952, there remain significant gaps in 
knowledge of CHIKV biology, pathogenesis, transmission, and mechanism. Diagnosis 
is largely simplified and based on symptoms, while treatment is supportive 
rather than curative. Here we present an overview of the disease, the challenges 
that lie ahead for future research, and what directions current studies are 
headed towards, with emphasis on improvement of current animal models and 
potential use of 3D models.
