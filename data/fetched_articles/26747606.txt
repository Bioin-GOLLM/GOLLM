Actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1) is a conserved WD repeat protein that 
promotes disassembly of actin filaments when actin-depolymerizing factor 
(ADF)/cofilin is present. Although AIP1 is known to be essential for a number of 
cellular events involving dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, the 
regulatory mechanism of the function of AIP1 is unknown. In this study, we 
report that two AIP1 isoforms from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, known as 
UNC-78 and AIPL-1, are pH-sensitive in enhancement of actin filament 
disassembly. Both AIP1 isoforms only weakly enhance disassembly of 
ADF/cofilin-bound actin filaments at an acidic pH but show stronger disassembly 
activity at neutral and basic pH values. However, a severing-defective mutant of 
UNC-78 shows pH-insensitive binding to ADF/cofilin-decorated actin filaments, 
suggesting that the process of filament severing or disassembly, but not 
filament binding, is pH-dependent. His-60 of AIP1 is located near the predicted 
binding surface for the ADF/cofilin-actin complex, and an H60K mutation of AIP1 
partially impairs its pH sensitivity, suggesting that His-60 is involved in the 
pH sensor for AIP1. These biochemical results suggest that pH-dependent changes 
in AIP1 activity might be a novel regulatory mechanism of actin filament 
dynamics.
