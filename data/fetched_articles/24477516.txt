The globin superfamily: functions in nitric oxide formation and decay.

Tejero J, Gladwin MT.

Globin proteins are ubiquitous in living organisms and carry out a variety of 
functions related to the ability of their prosthetic heme group to bind gaseous 
ligands, such as oxygen, nitric oxide (NO), and CO. Moreover, they catalyze 
important reactions with nitrogen oxide species, such as NO dioxygenation and 
nitrite reduction. The formation of NO from nitrite is a reaction catalyzed by 
globins that has received increasing attention due to its potential as a hypoxic 
NO signaling mechanism. In this review, we revisit the current knowledge about 
the role of globins in NO formation and its physiological implications.
