An isocratic, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure 
(HPLC) was developed for determination of the neuroprotective agent riluzole in 
mice plasma, brain and spinal cord. The procedure is based on isolation of the 
compound and the internal standard from plasma and central nervous system 
tissues using a Bakerbond spe C8 cartridge, with satisfactory recovery and 
specificity. Separation was on a C18 column, coupled with an UV detector at 263 
nm. The assay was linear over a wide range, with a lower limit of quantification 
of 100 ng ml(-1) or g(-1) using 0.1 ml of plasma and about 100mg of brain 
tissue. The precision and accuracy were within the acceptable limits for an HPLC 
assay. The method is currently used to support pharmacological studies of the 
activity of riluzole when given in combination with other potential 
neuroprotective agents in an animal model of familiar amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (SOD1-G93A transgenic mice).
