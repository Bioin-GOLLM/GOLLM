BACKGROUND: Individual differences in serotonin 7 receptor (5-HT7R) may result 
in variable response to antipsychotics with 5-HT7R antagonism. This study 
investigated the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
the 5-HT7R gene (HTR7) and the efficacy of second-generation antipsychotic drugs 
with a high affinity for this receptor in Japanese schizophrenia.
METHODS: Perospirone or aripiprazole was administered to 100 patients with 
schizophrenia in a randomized controlled study. All patients were genotyped for 
three candidate SNPs (rs12412496, rs7916403, and rs1935349). Patient improvement 
on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at 12 weeks was 
assessed as the primary outcome. PANSS 5-factor scores were investigated as the 
secondary outcome.
RESULTS: Improvement on the PANSS total score and genetic polymorphisms showed 
no correlation. The rs12412496-rs7916403-rs1935349 A-T-A haplotype was 
correlated with worse improvement in the cognition score (haplotype frequency: 
0.285, p = 0.046, permuted p = 0.043).
CONCLUSION: Our results show that HTR7 variants are not related to the overall 
improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.
