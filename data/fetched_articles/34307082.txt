The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction 
assay is one of the methods used to evaluate the viability of sperm. In the 
assay, a tetrazolium component (MTT) is converted into MTT formazan by some 
specific enzymes in the viable cells. The amount of formazan product in theory 
is directly correlated with the percentage of viable sperms. It is quantified by 
measuring the absorbance using a spectrophotometer. The present article compiles 
the MTT assays that have been used to determine sperm viability in most animal 
species and humans. In each assay, other factors apart from the number of viable 
cells that potentially influence the accuracy and precision of results are 
stated, such as preparations of sperm and MTT solutions, length and conditions 
of incubation, and a solubilizing agent as well as the formazan detection 
method. Also, the strengths and shortcomings of the MTT test comparison with the 
others are summarized at the end of this article. This information may be useful 
for prospective researchers deciding to implement this colorimetric method in 
their experiments.
