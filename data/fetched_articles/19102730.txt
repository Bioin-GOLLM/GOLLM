BACKGROUND: Genotyping technologies enable us to genotype multiple Single 
Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within selected genes/regions, providing data 
for haplotype association analysis. While haplotype-based association analysis 
is powerful for detecting untyped causal alleles in linkage-disequilibrium (LD) 
with neighboring SNPs/haplotypes, the inclusion of extraneous SNPs could reduce 
its power by increasing the number of haplotypes with each additional SNP.
METHODS: Here, we propose a haplotype-based stepwise procedure (HBSP) to 
eliminate extraneous SNPs. To evaluate its properties, we applied HBSP to both 
simulated and real data, generated from a study of genetic associations of the 
bactericidal/permeability-increasing (BPI) gene with pulmonary function in a 
cohort of patients following bone marrow transplantation.
RESULTS: Under the null hypothesis, use of the HBSP gave results that retained 
the desired false positive error rates when multiple comparisons were 
considered. Under various alternative hypotheses, HBSP had adequate power to 
detect modest genetic associations in case-control studies with 500, 1,000 or 
2,000 subjects. In the current application, HBSP led to the identification of 
two specific SNPs with a positive validation.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that HBSP retains the essence of 
haplotype-based association analysis while improving analytic power by excluding 
extraneous SNPs. Minimizing the number of SNPs also enables simpler 
interpretation and more cost-effective applications.
