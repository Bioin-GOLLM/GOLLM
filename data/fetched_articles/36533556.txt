Meckel syndrome, nephronophthisis, Joubert syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome 
are caused by mutations in proteins that localize to the ciliary transition zone 
(TZ). The phenotypically distinct syndromes suggest that these TZ proteins have 
differing functions. However, mutations in a single TZ gene can result in 
multiple syndromes, suggesting that the phenotype is influenced by modifier 
genes. We performed a comprehensive analysis of ten zebrafish TZ mutants, 
including mks1, tmem216, tmem67, rpgrip1l, cc2d2a, b9d2, cep290, tctn1, nphp1 
and nphp4, as well as mutants in ift88 and ift172. Our data indicate that 
variations in phenotypes exist between different TZ mutants, supporting 
different tissue-specific functions of these TZ genes. Further, we observed 
phenotypic variations within progeny of a single TZ mutant, reminiscent of 
multiple disease syndromes being associated with mutations in one gene. In some 
mutants, the dynamics of the phenotype became complex with transitory phenotypes 
that are corrected over time. We also demonstrated that multiple-guide-derived 
CRISPR/Cas9 F0 'crispant' embryos recapitulate zygotic null phenotypes, and 
rapidly identified ciliary phenotypes in 11 cilia-associated gene candidates 
(ankfn1, ccdc65, cfap57, fhad1, nme7, pacrg, saxo2, c1orf194, ttc26, zmynd12 and 
cfap52).
