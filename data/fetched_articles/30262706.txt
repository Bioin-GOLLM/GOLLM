Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (PAM) is an autosomal recessive disorder with 
distinctive deposition of calcium phosphate microliths in the lungs. Mutation of 
the SLC34A2 gene was proved to be responsible for PAM. Here, we report the study 
of a family affected by PAM in China. Two daughters of an inbred family whose 
parents are cousins and are affected by PAM. Mutation analysis of the SLC34A2 
gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and direct sequencing in 
both patients revealed that exon 5 was deleted on both alleles. Both parents of 
the patients are proved to be carriers of the mutated allele. Gap-PCR was 
performed to determine the breakpoints and a homologous deletion of 1152 bp 
encompassing exon 5 of the SLC34A2 gene (c.IVS4+1452_IVS5+660del) was confirmed. 
A 4-bp fragment of TGGG was located on the edge of both upstream and downstream 
breakpoints. The upstream breakpoint lies in the same region as the breakpoint 
of a fused gene SLC34A2-ROS1, which encodes a constitutive kinase in the lung 
cancer cell line HCC78 and nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), suggesting that 
the deletion in this family is a hot spot for recombination, not only in cancer 
samples with somatic mutation, but also in PAM patients with germline genetic 
defects of SLC34A2.
