BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Liver Cancer Risk test algorithm (LCR1-LCR2) is a 
multianalyte blood test combining proteins involved in liver cell repair 
(apolipoprotein-A1 and haptoglobin), known hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk 
factors (sex, age, and gamma-glutamyl transferase), a marker of fibrosis 
(alpha2-macroglobulin) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a specific marker of HCC. 
The aim was to externally validate the LCR1-LCR2 in patients with chronic HCV 
(CHC) treated or not with antivirals.
METHODS: Pre-included patients were from the Hepather cohort, a multicentre 
prospective study in adult patients with CHC in France. LCR1-LCR2 was assessed 
retrospectively in patients with the test components and AFP, available at 
baseline. The co-primary study outcome was the negative predictive value (NPV) 
of LCR1-LCR2 for the occurrence of HCC at 5 years and for survival without HCC 
according to the predetermined LCR1-LCR2 cut-offs. The cut-offs were adjusted 
for risk covariables and for the response to HCV treatment, and were quantified 
using time-dependent proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: In total, 4,903 patients, 1,026 (21.9%) with baseline cirrhosis, were 
included in the study. Patients were followed for a median of 5.7 (IQR 4.2-11.3) 
years. A total of 3,788/4,903 (77.3%) patients had a sustained virological 
response. There were 137 cases of HCC at 5 years and 214 at the end of 
follow-up. HCC occurred at 5 years in 24/3,755 patients with low-risk LCR1-LCR2 
compared with 113/1,148 patients with high-risk LCR1-LCR2. The NPV was 99.4% 
(95% CI 99.1-99.6). Similar findings (hazard ratio, 10.8; 95% CI, 8.1-14.3; p 
<0.001) were obtained after adjustment for exposure to antivirals, age, sex, 
geographical origin, HCV genotype 3, alcohol consumption, and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that LCR1-LCR2 can be used to successfully 
identify patients with HCV at very low risk of HCC at 5 years.
LAY SUMMARY: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of 
cancer-related death worldwide and the fastest growing cause of cancer death in 
many countries. We constructed and internally validated a new multianalyte blood 
test to assess this Liver Cancer Risk (LCR1-LCR2). This study confirmed the 
performance of LCR1-LCR2 in patients with chronic HCV in the national French 
cohort Hepather, and its ability to identify patients at a very low risk of HCC 
at 5 years.
CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT01953458).
