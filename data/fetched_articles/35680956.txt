Synucleinopathy (Parkinson's disease (PD); Lewy body dementia) disease-modifying 
treatments represent a huge unmet medical need. Although the PD-causing protein 
α-synuclein (αS) interacts with lipids and fatty acids (FA) physiologically and 
pathologically, targeting FA homeostasis for therapeutics is in its infancy. We 
identified the PD-relevant target stearoyl-coA desaturase: inhibiting 
monounsaturated FA synthesis reversed PD phenotypes. However, lipid degradation 
also generates FA pools. Here, we identify the rate-limiting lipase enzyme, 
LIPE, as a candidate target. Decreasing LIPE in human neural cells reduced αS 
inclusions. Patient αS triplication vs. corrected neurons had increased pSer129 
and insoluble αS and decreased αS tetramer:monomer ratios. LIPE inhibition 
rescued all these and the abnormal unfolded protein response. LIPE inhibitors 
decreased pSer129 and restored tetramer:monomer equilibrium in αS 
E46K-expressing human neurons. LIPE reduction in vivo alleviated αS-induced 
dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans. Co-regulating FA 
synthesis and degradation proved additive in rescuing PD phenotypes, signifying 
co-targeting as a therapeutic strategy.
