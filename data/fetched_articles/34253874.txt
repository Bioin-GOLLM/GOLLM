BACKGROUND: Patient selection for addition of anti-EGFR therapy to chemotherapy 
for patients with RAS and BRAF wildtype metastatic colorectal cancer can still 
be optimised. Here we investigate the effect of anti-EGFR therapy on survival in 
different consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) and stratified by primary tumour 
location.
METHODS: Retrospective analyses, using the immunohistochemistry-based CMS 
classifier, were performed in the COIN (first-line oxaliplatin backbone with or 
without cetuximab) and PICCOLO trial (second-line irinotecan with or without 
panitumumab). Tumour tissue was available for 323 patients (20%) and 349 (41%), 
respectively.
RESULTS: When using an irinotecan backbone, anti-EGFR therapy is effective in 
both CMS2/3 and CMS4 in left-sided primary tumours (progression-free survival 
(PFS): HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.75, P = 0.003 and HR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.36, 
P < 0.001, respectively) and in CMS4 right-sided tumours (PFS HR 0.17, 95% CI 
0.04-0.71, P = 0.02). Efficacy using an oxaliplatin backbone was restricted to 
left-sided CMS2/3 tumours (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.96, P = 0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: The subtype-specific efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy is dependent on 
the chemotherapy backbone. This may provide the possibility of subtype-specific 
treatment strategies for a more optimal use of anti-EGFR therapy.
