Although recent innovations in transient plant systems have enabled gram 
quantities of proteins in 1-2 weeks, very few have been translated into 
applications due to technical challenges and high downstream processing costs. 
Here we report high-level production, using a Nicotiana benthamiana/p19 system, 
of an engineered recombinant human acetylcholinesterase (rAChE) that is highly 
stable in a minimally processed leaf extract. Lyophylized clarified extracts 
withstand prolonged storage at 70 °C and, upon reconstitution, can be used in 
several devices to detect organophosphate (OP) nerve agents and pesticides on 
surfaces ranging from 0 °C to 50 °C. The recent use of sarin in Syria highlights 
the urgent need for nerve agent detection and countermeasures necessary for 
preparedness and emergency responses. Bypassing cumbersome and expensive 
downstream processes has enabled us to fully exploit the speed, low cost and 
scalability of transient production systems resulting in the first successful 
implementation of plant-produced rAChE into a commercial biotechnology product.
