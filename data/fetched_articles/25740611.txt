Mutations of the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain seem to be the most common cause of 
imatinib mesylate resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We screened 
BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations using nested reverse transcriptase polymerase 
chain reaction and direct sequencing in 30 CML patients including 22 resistant 
patients and 8 patients with optimal response to imatinib. Three mutations of 
two different types were identified in 3 of 22 (13.6%) resistant patients. Two 
patients had p.E355G mutation in the catalytic domain, and the third patient had 
p.G398R in the activation loop that is reported here for the first time. No 
mutation was found in patients with optimal response to imatinib. The frequency 
of mutations was similar in patients with primary resistance compared with 
patients with secondary resistance (25 vs 11%; P=1). Mutation status had no 
impact on the overall survival and progression-free survival. p.E355G mutation 
was correlated with shorter survival (P=0.047) in resistant patients. We 
conclude that BCR- ABL1 mutations are associated with the clinical resistance, 
but may not be considered the only cause of resistance to imatinib. Mutational 
analysis may identify resistant patients at risk of disease progression.
