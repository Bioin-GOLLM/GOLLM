Language is one of the cognitive domains often impaired across many 
neurodevelopmental disorders. While for some disorders the linguistic deficit is 
the primary impairment (e.g., specific language impairment, SLI), for others it 
may accompany broader behavioral problems (e.g., autism). The precise nature of 
this phenotypic overlap has been the subject of debate. Moreover, several 
studies have found genetic overlaps across neurodevelopmental disorders. This 
raises the question of whether these genetic overlaps may correlate with 
phenotypic overlaps and, if so, in what manner. Here, we apply a genome-wide 
approach to the study of the linguistic deficit in SLI, autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using a discovery 
genome-wide association study of SLI, we generate polygenic risk scores (PRS) in 
an independent sample which includes children with language impairment, SLI, ASD 
or ADHD and age-matched controls and perform regression analyses across groups. 
The SLI-trained PRS significantly predicted risk in the SLI case-control group 
(adjusted R2 = 6.24%; P = 0.024) but not in the ASD or ADHD case-control groups 
(adjusted R2 = 0.0004%, 0.01%; P = 0.984, 0.889, respectively) nor for height, 
used as a negative control (R2 = 0.2%; P = 0.452). Additionally, there was a 
significant difference in the normalized PRS between children with SLI and 
children with ASD (common language effect size = 0.66; P = 0.044). Our study 
suggests no additive common-variant genetic overlap between SLI and ASD and 
ADHD. This is discussed in the context of phenotypic studies of SLI and related 
disorders. Autism Res 2020, 13: 369-381. © 2019 The Authors. Autism Research

language impairment (SLI), but may also be found in other neurodevelopmental 
disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Many studies examined the overlaps and 
differences across the language deficits in these disorders, but few studies 
have examined the genetic aspect thereof. In this study, we use a genome-wide 
approach to evaluate whether common genetic variants increasing risk of SLI may 
also be associated with ASD and ADHD in the same manner. Our results suggest 
that this is not the case, and we discuss this finding in the context of 
theories concerning the etiologies of these disorders.
