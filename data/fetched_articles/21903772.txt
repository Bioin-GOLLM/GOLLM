PURPOSE: Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of ovarian cancer that 
closely recapitulate their human tumor counterparts may be invaluable tools for 
preclinical testing of novel therapeutics. We studied murine ovarian 
endometrioid adenocarcinomas (OEA) arising from conditional dysregulation of 
canonical WNT and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway signaling to investigate their response 
to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and mTOR or AKT inhibitors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: OEAs were induced by injection of adenovirus expressing Cre 
recombinase (AdCre) into the ovarian bursae of Apc(flox/flox); Pten(flox/flox) 
mice. Tumor-bearing mice or murine OEA-derived cell lines were treated with 
cisplatin and paclitaxel, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or AKT inhibitors API-2 or 
perifosine. Treatment effects were monitored in vivo by tumor volume and 
bioluminescence imaging, in vitro by WST-1 proliferation assays, and in OEA 
tissues and cells by immunoblotting and immunostaining for levels and 
phosphorylation status of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway components.
RESULTS: Murine OEAs developed within 3 weeks of AdCre injection and were not 
preceded by endometriosis. OEAs responded to cisplatin + paclitaxel, rapamycin, 
and AKT inhibitors in vivo. In vitro studies showed that response to mTOR and 
AKT inhibitors, but not conventional cytotoxic drugs, was dependent on the 
status of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. AKT inhibition in APC(-)/Pten(-) tumor cells 
resulted in compensatory upregulation of ERK signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: The studies show the utility of this GEM model of ovarian cancer 
for preclinical testing of novel PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling inhibitors and provide 
evidence for compensatory signaling, suggesting that multiple rather than single 
agent targeted therapy will be more efficacious for treating ovarian cancers 
with activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.
