AIM: The chemerin receptor CMKLR1 is one type of G protein-coupled receptors 
abundant in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages, which plays a key 
role in the entry of a subset of immunodeficiency viruses including HIV/SIV into 
lymphocytes and macrophages. The aim of this work was to investigate how CMKLR1 
was internalized and whether its internalization affected cell signaling in 
vitro.
METHODS: Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, HEK 293 cells, and HeLa cells 
were used. CMKLR1 internalization was visualized by confocal microscopy imaging 
or using a FACScan flow cytometer. Six potential phosphorylation sites (Ser337, 
Ser343, Thr352, Ser344, Ser347, and Ser350) in CMKLR1 were substituted with 
alanine using site-directed mutagenesis. Heterologous expression of wild type 
and mutant CMKLR1 allowed for functional characterization of endocytosis, Ca(2+) 
flux and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation.
RESULTS: Chemerin and the chemerin-derived nonapeptide (C9) induced 
dose-dependent loss of cell surface CMKLR1-GFP fusion protein and increased its 
intracellular accumulation in HEK 293 cells and RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing 
CMKLR1. Up to 90% of CMKLR1 was internalized after treatment with C9 (1 Î¼mol/L). 
By using different agents, it was demonstrated that clathrin-independent 
mechanism was involved in CMKLR1 internalization. Mutations in Ser343 for G 
protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation and in Ser347 for PKC 
phosphorylation abrogated CMKLR1 internalization. Loss of CMKLR1 internalization 
partially enhanced the receptor signaling, as shown by increased Ca(2+) flux and 
a shorter latency to peak level of ERK phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: CMKLR1 internalization occurs in a clathrin-independent manner, 
which negatively regulated the receptor-mediated Ca(2+) flux and ERK 
phosphorylation.
