Arginine kinase catalyzes reversible phosphoryl transfer between arginine and 
ATP. Crystal structures of arginine kinase in an open, substrate-free form and 
closed, transition state analog (TSA) complex indicate that the enzyme undergoes 
substantial domain and loop rearrangements required for substrate binding, 
catalysis, and product release. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has shown that 
substrate-free arginine kinase is rigid on the ps-ns timescale (average 
S2=0.84±0.08) yet quite dynamic on the µs-ms timescale (35 residues with Rex, 
12%), and that movements of the N-terminal domain and the loop comprising 
residues I182-G209 are rate-limiting on catalysis. Here, NMR of the TSA-bound 
enzyme shows similar rigidity on the ps-ns timescale (average S2=0.91±0.05) and 
substantially increased μs-ms timescale dynamics (77 residues; 22%). Many of the 
residues displaying μs-ms dynamics in NMR Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) 15N 
backbone relaxation dispersion experiments of the TSA complex are also dynamic 
in substrate-free enzyme. However, the presence of additional dynamic residues 
in the TSA-bound form suggests that dynamics extend through much of the 
C-terminal domain, which indicates that in the closed form, a larger fraction of 
the protein takes part in conformational transitions to the excited state(s). 
Conformational exchange rate constants (kex) of the TSA complex are all 
approximately 2500s-1, higher than any observed in the substrate-free enzyme 
(800-1900s-1). Elevated μs-ms timescale protein dynamics in the TSA-bound enzyme 
is more consistent with recently postulated catalytic networks involving 
multiple interconnected states at each step of the reaction, rather than a 
classical single stabilized transition state.
