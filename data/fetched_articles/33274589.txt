Autophagy mediates the degradation of cytoplasmic material. Upon autophagy 
induction, autophagosomes form a sealed membrane around the cargo and fuse with 
the lytic compartment to release the cargo for degradation. In order to avoid 
premature fusion of immature autophagosomal membranes with the lytic 
compartment, this process needs to be tightly regulated. Several factors 
mediating autophagosome-vacuole fusion have recently been identified. In budding 
yeast, autophagosome-vacuole fusion requires the R-SNARE Ykt6 on the 
autophagosome, together with the three Q-SNAREs Vam3, Vam7, and Vti1 on the 
vacuole. However, how these SNAREs are regulated during the fusion process is 
poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the regulation of Ykt6. We 
found that Ykt6 is directly phosphorylated by Atg1 kinase, which keeps this 
SNARE in an inactive state. Ykt6 phosphorylation prevents SNARE bundling by 
disrupting its interaction with the vacuolar SNAREs Vam3 and Vti1, thereby 
preventing premature autophagosome-vacuole fusion. These findings shed new light 
on the regulation of autophagosome-vacuole fusion and reveal a further step in 
autophagy controlled by the Atg1 kinase.
