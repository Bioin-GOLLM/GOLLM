The biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in musts and wines of Albariño variety 
has been studied. The identification of species was addressed through a 
combination of biochemical and genetic methods (API® 50 CHL test, 16S rDNA and 
recA gene sequences, Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis -ARDRA- and 
16S-26S intergenic region analysis). The results grouped the isolates into six 
species predominating those of the genus Lactobacillus and showing a typical 
biogeographical distribution. Among sixteen strains evaluated, eight of them 
showed malolactic activity. The study of the presence of genes hdc, odc, and 
tdc, along with the LC/MS-MS analysis of biogenic amines in wine, showed five 
strains lacking aminogenic ability. The absence of the pad gene in the 
above-mentioned strains discards its ability to produce volatile phenols that 
may adversely affect the aroma. Finally, all malolactic strains showed 
β-glucosidase activity so that they could contribute to enhance and 
differentiate the aromatic profile of Albariño wines.
