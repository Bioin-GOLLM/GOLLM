Genetic and in vivo evidence suggests that aberrant recognition of 
RNA-containing autoantigens by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8 drives 
autoimmune diseases. Here we report on the preclinical characterization of 
MHV370, a selective oral TLR7/8 inhibitor. In vitro, MHV370 inhibits 
TLR7/8-dependent production of cytokines in human and mouse cells, notably 
interferon-α, a clinically validated driver of autoimmune diseases. Moreover, 
MHV370 abrogates B cell, plasmacytoid dendritic cell, monocyte, and neutrophil 
responses downstream of TLR7/8. In vivo, prophylactic or therapeutic 
administration of MHV370 blocks secretion of TLR7 responses, including cytokine 
secretion, B cell activation, and gene expression of, e.g., 
interferon-stimulated genes. In the NZB/W F1 mouse model of lupus, MHV370 halts 
disease. Unlike hydroxychloroquine, MHV370 potently blocks interferon responses 
triggered by specific immune complexes from systemic lupus erythematosus patient 
sera, suggesting differentiation from clinical standard of care. These data 
support advancement of MHV370 to an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial.
