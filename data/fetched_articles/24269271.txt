BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified the CACNA1C single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1006737 as one of the most consistent genetic 
findings as susceptibility locus for major psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, 
animal and genetic imaging studies have reported strong functional evidence for 
the association of CACNA1C with learning, memory, neural plasticity, and its 
association with the hippocampal formation. In the present study we investigated 
the impact of the CACNA1C SNP rs1006737 on the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the 
hippocampal formation as well as on verbal learning and memory in healthy 
individuals.
METHODS: 118 healthy individuals (72 males, 46 females, age 18-56years) 
initially underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 100 of them were included in 
the final analysis. We used Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to examine the 
impact of the CACNA1C SNP rs1006737 on the hippocampal formation as predefined 
region of interest (ROI). Furthermore, all participants completed the Verbal 
Learning and Memory Test (VLMT).
RESULTS: In the VLMT genotype was significantly associated with learning 
performance. Bonferroni corrected post-hoc tests indicated a diminished 
performance at the beginning of the learning curve in risk allele carriers 
compared to non-risk allele carriers. The TBSS ROI analysis revealed one cluster 
of reduced FA in risk allele carriers compared to non-risk allele carriers 
located in the right hippocampal formation. Moreover, an association between the 
initial learning performance and FA values was found.
DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate that genetic variation in the CACNA1C SNP 
rs1006737 is associated with FA reduction in the hippocampal formation as well 
as with differences in learning performance in healthy individuals.
