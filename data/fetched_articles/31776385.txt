Lung cancer patients face a dismal prognosis mainly due to the low efficacy of 
current available treatments. Cisplatin is the first-line chemotherapy treatment 
for those patients, however, resistance to this drug is a common and yet not 
fully understood phenomenon. Aiming to shed new light into this puzzle, we used 
established normal and malignant lung cell lines displaying different 
sensitivity towards cisplatin treatment. We observed a negative correlation 
between cell viability and DNA damage induction upon cisplatin treatment. 
Interestingly, drug sensitivity in those cell lines was not due to either 
difference on DNA repair capacity, or in the amount of membrane ion channel 
commonly used for cisplatin uptake. Also, we noted that glutathione 
intracellular levels, and expression and activity of the transcription factor 
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) were determinant for 
cisplatin cytotoxicity. Remarkably, analysis of gene expression in non-small 
cell lung cancer patients of the TCGA data bank revealed that there is a 
significant lower overall survival rate in the subset of patients bearing tumors 
with unbalanced levels of NRF2/KEAP1 and, as consequence, increased expression 
of NRF2 target genes. Thus, the results indicate that NRF2 and glutathione 
levels figure as important cisplatin resistance biomarkers in lung cancer.
