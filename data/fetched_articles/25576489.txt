Hypochlorous acid added as reagent or generated by the myeloperoxidase 
(MPO)-H2O2-Cl(-) system oxidatively modifies brain ether-phospholipids 
(plasmalogens). This reaction generates a sn2-acyl-lysophospholipid and 
chlorinated fatty aldehydes. 2-Chlorohexadecanal (2-ClHDA), a prototypic member 
of chlorinated long-chain fatty aldehydes, has potent neurotoxic potential by 
inflicting blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage. During earlier studies we could 
show that the dihydrochalcone-type polyphenol phloretin attenuated 
2-ClHDA-induced BBB dysfunction. To clarify the underlying mechanism(s) we now 
investigated the possibility of covalent adduct formation between 2-ClHDA and 
phloretin. Coincubation of 2-ClHDA and phloretin in phosphatidylcholine 
liposomes revealed a half-life of 2-ClHDA of approx. 120min, decaying at a rate 
of 5.9×10(-3)min(-1). NMR studies and enthalpy calculations suggested that 
2-ClHDA-phloretin adduct formation occurs via electrophilic aromatic 
substitution followed by hemiacetal formation on the A-ring of phloretin. Adduct 
characterization by high-resolution mass spectroscopy confirmed these results. 
In contrast to 2-ClHDA, the covalent 2-ClHDA-phloretin adduct was without 
adverse effects on MTT reduction (an indicator for metabolic activity), cellular 
adenine nucleotide content, and barrier function of brain microvascular 
endothelial cells (BMVEC). Of note, 2-ClHDA-phloretin adduct formation was also 
observed in BMVEC cultures. Intraperitoneal application and subsequent GC-MS 
analysis of brain lipid extracts revealed that phloretin is able to penetrate 
the BBB of C57BL/6J mice. Data of the present study indicate that phloretin 
scavenges 2-ClHDA, thereby attenuating 2-ClHDA-mediated brain endothelial cell 
dysfunction. We here identify a detoxification pathway for a prototypic 
chlorinated fatty aldehyde (generated via the MPO axis) that compromises BBB 
function in vitro and in vivo.
