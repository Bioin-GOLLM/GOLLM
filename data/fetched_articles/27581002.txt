BACKGROUND: The IRAK1 and miR-499 polymorphisms play an important role in the 
etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several studies have been carried out to 
estimate the association between IRAK1 rs3027898 and miR-499 rs3746444 and RA 
risk; however, the results were inconsistent.
AIM: A case control study was carried out to explore the association between 
IRAK1 rs3027898 and miR-499 rs3746444 and the RA risk in a Chinese population. 
Meta-analyses combining present with previous studies were conducted to further 
explore the association.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 386 RA patients were enrolled along with 
576 matched healthy controls. Genotyping was performed by using TaqMan 
genotyping assays on Fluidigm 192.24 system. For the meta-analysis, a systematic 
literature search was conducted to identify all relevant studies.
RESULTS: This case control study showed that the IRAK1 rs3027898 C allele was 
associated with increased risk of RA with an odds ratio (OR) = 1.4 and 95 % 
confidence intervals (CI) = 1.093-1.793, P = 0.008 but miR-499 rs3746444 
polymorphisms were not significantly associated with the risk for RA. The 
meta-analyses included a total of 4 case control studies on IRAK1 rs3027898 and 
4 studies on miR-499 rs3746444. The IRAK1 rs3027898 C allele had an overall OR 
of 1.268 (95 % CI = 1.130-1.424, P < 0.001). After stratification by ethnicity 
the C allele had an OR of 1.238 (95 % CI = 1.096-1.398, P = 0.001) in Asians. No 
association between miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism and RA was found in the 
overall and Asian populations.
CONCLUSION: The results from our case control study and the meta-analyses 
indicate that the IRAK1 rs3027898 C allele is significantly associated with an 
increased risk of RA, especially in Asians.
