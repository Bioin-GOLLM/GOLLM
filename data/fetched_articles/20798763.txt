Amyloid beta (Abeta) annular protofibrils (APFs) have been described where the 
structure is related to that of beta barrel pore-forming bacterial toxins and 
exhibits cellular toxicity. To investigate the relationship of Abeta APFs to 
disease and their ultrastructural localization in brain tissue, we conducted a 
pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopic study using anti-annular protofibril 
antiserum. We examined brain tissues of young- and old-aged amyloid precursor 
protein transgenic mice (APP23), neprilysin knockout APP23 mice, and 
nontransgenic littermates. alphaAPF-immunoreactions tended to be found (1) on 
plasma membranes and vesicles inside of cell processes, but not on amyloid 
fibrils, (2) with higher density due to aging, APP transgene, and neprilysin 
deficiency, and (3) with higher positive rate at synaptic compartments in aged 
APP23, especially in neprilysin knockout APP23 mice. These findings imply that 
APFs are distinct from amyloid fibrils, interact with biological membranes, and 
might be related to synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer model mouse brains.
