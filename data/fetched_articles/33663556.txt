BACKGROUND: Prevention of hyperuricaemia (HU) is critical to the prevention of 
gout. Understanding causal relationships and relative contributions of various 
risk factors to hyperuricemia is therefore important in the prevention of gout. 
Here, we use attributable fraction to compare the relative contribution of 
genetic, dietary, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and other exposures to HU. We use 
Mendelian randomisation to test for the causality of diet in urate levels.
METHODS: Four European-ancestry sample sets, three from the general population 
(n = 419,060) and one of people with gout (n = 6781) were derived from the 
Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (ARIC, FHS, CARDIA, CHS) and UK Biobank. 
Dichotomised exposures to diet, genetic risk variants, BMI, alcohol, diuretic 
treatment, sex and age were used to calculate adjusted population and average 
attributable fractions (PAF/AAF) for HU (≥0.42 mmol/L [≥7 mg/dL]). Exposure to 
ULT was also assessed in the gout cohort. Two sample Mendelian randomisation was 
done in the UK Biobank using dietary pattern-associated genetic variants as 
exposure and serum urate levels as outcome.
RESULTS: Adherence to dietary recommendations, BMI (< 25 kg/m2), and absence of 
the SLC2A9 rs12498742 urate-raising allele produced PAFs for HU of 20 to 24%, 59 
to 69%, and 57 to 64%, respectively, in the three non-gout cohorts. In the gout 
cohort, diet, BMI, SLC2A9 rs12498742 and ULT PAFs for HU were 12%, 49%, 48%, and 
63%, respectively. Mendelian randomisation demonstrated weak causal effects of 
four dietary habits on serum urate levels (e.g. preferentially drinking skim 
milk increased urate, β = 0.047 mmol/L, P = 3.78 × 10-8). These effects were 
mediated by BMI, and they were not significant (P ≥ 0.06) in multivariable 
models assessing the BMI-independent effect of diet on urate.
CONCLUSIONS: Diet has a relatively minor role in determining serum urate levels 
and HU. In gout, the use of ULT was the largest attributable fraction tested for 
HU.
