Stratification of cardiac patients arriving at the emergency department is now 
being made according to the levels of acute cardiac biomarkers (i.e. cardiac 
troponin (cTn) or creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB)). Ongoing efforts are 
undertaken in an attempt to identify and validate additional cardiac biomarkers, 
for example, interleukin-6, soluble CD40L, and C-reactive protein, in order to 
further risk stratify patients with acute coronary syndrome. Several studies 
have also now shown an association of platelet transcriptome and genomic single 
nucleotide polymorphisms with myocardial infarction by using advanced genomic 
tools. A number of markers, such as myeloid-related protein 14 (MRP-14), 
cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), leukotriene 
A(4) hydrolase (LTA4H) and myocyte enhancing factor 2A (MEF2A), have been linked 
to acute coronary syndromes, including myocardial infarction. In the future, 
these novel markers may pave the way toward personalized disease-prevention 
programs based on a person's genomic, thrombotic and cardiovascular profiles. 
Current and future biomarkers and bioassays for identifying at-risk patients 
will be discussed in this review.
