Intramembrane proteolysis describes the cleavage of substrate proteins within 
their hydrophobic transmembrane segments. Several families of intramembrane 
proteases have been identified including the aspartyl proteases Signal peptide 
peptidase (SPP) and its homologues, the SPP-like (SPPL) proteases SPPL2a, 
SPPL2b, SPPL2c and SPPL3. As presenilin homologues, they employ a similar 
catalytic mechanism as the well-studied γ-secretase. However, SPP/SPPL proteases 
cleave transmembrane proteins with a type II topology. The characterisation of 
SPP/SPPL-deficient mouse models has highlighted a still growing spectrum of 
biological functions and also promoted the substrate discovery of these 
proteases. In this review, we will summarise the current hypotheses how 
phenotypes of these mouse models are linked to the molecular function of the 
enzymes. At the cellular level, SPP/SPPL-mediated cleavage events rather provide 
specific regulatory switches than unspecific bulk proteolysis. By this means, a 
plethora of different cell biological pathways is influenced including signal 
transduction, membrane trafficking and protein glycosylation.
