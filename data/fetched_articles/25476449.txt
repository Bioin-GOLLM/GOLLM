Hedgehog signaling is essential for tissue development and stemness, and its 
deregulation has been observed in many tumors. Aberrant activation of Hedgehog 
signaling is the result of genetic mutations of pathway components or other 
Smo-dependent or independent mechanisms, all triggering the downstream effector 
Gli1. For this reason, understanding the poorly elucidated mechanism of 
Gli1-mediated transcription allows to identify novel molecules blocking the 
pathway at a downstream level, representing a critical goal in tumor biology. 
Here, we clarify the structural requirements of the pathway effector Gli1 for 
binding to DNA and identify Glabrescione B as the first small molecule binding 
to Gli1 zinc finger and impairing Gli1 activity by interfering with its 
interaction with DNA. Remarkably, as a consequence of its robust inhibitory 
effect on Gli1 activity, Glabrescione B inhibited the growth of 
Hedgehog-dependent tumor cells in vitro and in vivo as well as the self-renewal 
ability and clonogenicity of tumor-derived stem cells. The identification of the 
structural requirements of Gli1/DNA interaction highlights their relevance for 
pharmacologic interference of Gli signaling.
