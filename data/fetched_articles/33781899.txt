OBJECTIVE: To compare gait biomechanics 6 months following anterior cruciate 
ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) between patients with the highest and 
lowest concentrations of synovial fluid (SF) interleukin-6 (IL-6) and matrix 
metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), as well as compared to uninjured controls.
DESIGN: SF concentrations of IL-6 and MMP-3 were collected 7 ± 4 days post 
injury in 38 ACL injured patients (55% female, 21±4yrs, 25.3 ± 5.2BMI). ACL 
injured individuals were stratified into the lowest and highest quartiles based 
on IL-6 (IL-6Lowest and IL-6Highest) and MMP-3 (MMP-3Lowest and MMP-3Highest) 
concentrations. Gait biomechanics were collected on the injured limb 6 months 
post-ACLR and in 38 uninjured controls (50% female, 21±3yrs, 23.8 ± 2.8BMI). 
Functional analyses of variance were used to compare vertical ground reaction 
force (vGRF), knee flexion angle (KFA), and internal knee extension moment (KEM) 
waveforms throughout stance phase of gait to determine the proportions of stance 
differing between limbs and groups.
RESULTS: Compared to uninjured controls, IL-6High and MMP-3High ACL subgroups 
demonstrated lesser vGRF (largest differences: IL-6, 7.88%BW; MMP-3, 11.05%BW) 
during early-stance and greater vGRF (largest differences: IL-6, 6.21%BW; MMP-3, 
5.85%BW) in mid-stance, lesser KFA (largest differences: IL-6, 3.11°; MMP-3, 
3.72°) and lesser KEM (largest differences: IL-6, 0.96%BW•m; MMP-3, 1.07%BW•m) 
in early-stance, as well as greater KFA in mid-stance (largest differences: 
IL-6, 1.5°; MMP-3, 2.95°).
CONCLUSIONS: High SF concentrations of a proinflammatory cytokine and a 
degradative enzyme early post-ACL injury are associated with aberrant gait 
biomechanics in the injured limb at 6 months post-ACLR (i.e., lesser vGRF, KFA 
and KEM) linked to posttraumatic osteoarthritis development.
