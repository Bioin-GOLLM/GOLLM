Previously, we reported the establishment of two transplantable osteosarcomas, 
one induced by local application of a carcinogen, 4-hydroxyamino quinoline 
1-oxide(4-HAQO), and another which developed spontaneously in rats, and their 
subdivision into four lines with high and low metastatic potential to the lung. 
In the present study, mutations of p53 and Ki-ras genes were investigated by PCR 
and SSCP followed by direct sequencing, and the amplification of the mdm2 gene 
was assessed by Southern blot analysis. Mutations of p53 in exon 7 were detected 
in 4-HAQO-induced transplantable osteosarcomas, but not their spontaneous 
counterparts, irrespective of the metastatic potentials. Direct sequencing 
revealed a CGC to CAC transition with an amino acid change of Arg to His, at 
codon 246. Neither Ki-ras mutations nor mdm2 amplification were detected in any 
of the transplantable tumors. The results suggest that while p53 mutations 
occurred during osteosarcoma development by 4-HAQO without mdm2 amplification 
and Ki-ras mutation does not contribute to osteosarcoma development in rats.
