Hernia and Cryptorchidism.

Homozygous loss of function mutations in genes encoding anti-Müllerian hormone 
(AMH) or its receptor (AMHRII) lead to persistent Müllerian duct syndrome 
(PMDS). PMDS is characterized by the presence of a uterus, fallopian tubes, 
cervix, and upper vagina in fully virilised 46,XY males. Both surgical 
management and long-term follow-up of these patients are challenging. Four cases 
with PMDS presented with cryptorchidism and inguinal hernia, and laparoscopic 
inguinal exploration revealed Müllerian remnants. Three of the patients had 
homozygous mutations in the AMH gene, one with a novel c.1673G>A (p.Gly558Asp) 
mutation, and one patient had an AMHRII mutation. All patients underwent a 
single-stage laparotomy in which the fundus of the uterus was split along the 
midline to release testes and to avoid damaging the vas deferens or the 
deferential artery. Biopsy of Müllerian remnants did not reveal any malignancy. 
The cases presented here expand the clinical and molecular presentation of PMDS. 
Cryptorchidism and inguinal hernia in the presence of Müllerian structures in an 
appropriately virilised 46,XY individual should suggest PMDS. Long-term 
reproductive and endocrinological surveillance is necessary.
