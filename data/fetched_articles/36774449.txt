Impairment in social functioning is a common source of morbidity across many 
mental health disorders, yet there is a dearth of effective and easily 
implemented interventions to support social functioning. MDMA/ecstasy and 
classic psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD, peyote, mescaline) represent two 
potential treatments for impairments in social functioning, as evidence suggests 
these compounds may be supportive for alleviating social difficulties. Using a 
nationally representative sample of U.S. adults from the National Survey on Drug 
Use and Health (2015-2019) (N = 214,505), we used survey-weighted multivariable 
ordinal and logistic regression to examine the associations between lifetime use 
of the aforementioned compounds and impairments in social functioning in the 
past year. Lifetime MDMA/ecstasy use was associated with lowered odds of three 
of our four social impairment outcomes: difficulty dealing with strangers (aOR 
0.92), difficulty participating in social activities (aOR 0.90), and being 
prevented from participating in social activities (aOR 0.84). Lifetime mescaline 
use was also associated with lowered odds of difficulty dealing with strangers 
(aOR 0.85). All other substances either shared no relationship with impairments 
in social functioning or conferred increased odds of our outcomes. Future 
experimental studies can assess whether these relationships are causal.
