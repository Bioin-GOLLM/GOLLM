The utilization of organic solvents as reaction media for enzymatic reactions 
provides numerous industrially attractive advantages. However, an adaptation of 
enzyme towards organic solvent is unpredictable and not fully understood because 
of limited information on the organic solvent tolerant enzymes. To understand 
how the enzyme can adapt to the organic solvent environment, structural and 
computational approaches were employed. A recombinant elastase from Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa strain K was an organic solvent tolerant zinc metalloprotease was 
successfully crystallized and diffracted up to 1.39 Å. Crystal structure of 
elastase from strain K showed the typical, canonical alpha-beta hydrolase fold 
consisting of 10-helices (118 residues), 10- β-strands (38 residues) and 142 
residues were formed other secondary structure such as loop and coil to whole 
structure. The elastase from Pseusomonas aeruginosa strain K possess His-140, 
His-144 and Glu-164 served as a ligand for zinc ion. The conserved catalytic 
triad was composed of Glu-141, Tyr-155 and His-223. Three-dimensional structure 
features such as calcium-binding and presence of disulphide-bridge contribute to 
the stabilizing the elastase structure. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of 
elastase revealed that, amino acid residues located at the surface area and 
disulphide bridge in Cys-30 to Cys-58 were responsible for enzyme stability in 
organic solvents.
