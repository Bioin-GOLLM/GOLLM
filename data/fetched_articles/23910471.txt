Premalignancy and chemoprevention studies in head and neck cancer typically 
focus on the oral cavity. Avoiding or cessation of alcohol and smoking, early 
detection of potentially malignant disorders or cancer, and early detection of 
recurrent and/or second primary tumor form the basis of prevention of oral 
cancer. Analysis of tissue prospectively collected in evaluation of retinoids 
for chemoprevention trials allowed identification of molecular biomarkers of 
risk to develop oral cancer, loss of heterozygosity being the most validated 
one. Improving risk assessment and identification of new targets for 
chemoprevention represent the main challenges in this field.
