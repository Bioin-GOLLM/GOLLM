Herein, we report the obtaining of new hybrid molecules of amphetamine with 
different profens (amfens). The obtained amfens are characterized by their 
melting points, UV, 1H-, 13C-NMR, and HRMS spectra. A complete and detailed mass 
spectral analysis of the newly obtained derivatives of amphetamine with 
ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and carprofen was performed. In 
vitro inhibition of albumin denaturation of each new compound was assessed, and 
they showed significant activity. The IC50 values of the obtained 
amphetamine-profen derivatives ranged from 92.81 to 159.87 Âµg/mL. This indicates 
that the new hybrids inherit the anti-inflammatory properties of profens. Using 
in silico method, the toxicity was also calculated. The obtained results are 
given in LD50 values. Depending on the route of administration, the amfens are 
less toxic compared to the standard amphetamine.
