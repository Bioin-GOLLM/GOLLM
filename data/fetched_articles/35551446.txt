Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in deficits that are often followed by 
recovery. The contralesional cortex can contribute to this process but how 
distinct contralesional neurons and circuits respond to injury remains to be 
determined. To unravel adaptations in the contralesional cortex, we used chronic 
in vivo two-photon imaging. We observed a general decrease in spine density with 
concomitant changes in spine dynamics over time. With retrograde co-labeling 
techniques, we showed that callosal neurons are uniquely affected by and 
responsive to TBI. To elucidate circuit connectivity, we used monosynaptic 
rabies tracing, clearing techniques and histology. We demonstrate that 
contralesional callosal neurons adapt their input circuitry by strengthening 
ipsilateral connections from pre-connected areas. Finally, functional in vivo 
two-photon imaging demonstrates that the restoration of pre-synaptic circuitry 
parallels the restoration of callosal activity patterns. Taken together our 
study thus delineates how callosal neurons structurally and functionally adapt 
following a contralateral murine TBI.
