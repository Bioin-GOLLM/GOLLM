OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to assess the relationship between 
variability in genes related to the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD) and the concentration of different neurometabolites in the 
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
METHODS: We concomitantly assessed neurometabolite concentrations using 3-T 
(1)H-MRS and 262 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in 35 genes in 41 
paediatric OCD patients.
RESULTS: There were significant associations, after Bonferroni correction, 
between the concentration of inositol, glutamate and glutamine, and total 
choline and five polymorphisms located in genes related to serotonin and 
glutamate (i.e., the vesicular monoamine transporter 1 gene, SLC18A1 
[rs6586896]; the serotonin receptor 1B gene, HTR1B [rs6296 and rs6298]; and the 
glutamate receptor, ionotropic, AMPA1 gene, GRIA1 [rs707176 and rs2963944]).
CONCLUSIONS: The association observed between these polymorphisms and the 
neurometabolite concentrations could indicate the presence of a biological 
interaction between the serotonin and the glutamate pathways that could be 
involved in the pathophysiology of OCD. More studies with this methodology could 
increase our understanding of the aetiology and pathophysiology of OCD in 
children.
