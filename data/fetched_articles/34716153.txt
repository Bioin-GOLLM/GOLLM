INTRODUCTION: Studies suggest that continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) play an 
important role in the management of diabetes. Although general acceptance has 
been reported by patients with type 2 diabetes towards the use of CGMs, 
potential barriers exist like pain due to sensor insertion, accidental removal 
of the device or adhesive strip, impacts of daily activities, skin reactions to 
sensor adhesive, etc. This systematic review of qualitative studies aims to 
explore the perspectives, experiences and narratives of patients and caregivers 
about CGM use, and its barriers and facilitators.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will include qualitative studies and 
cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies using open-ended questions, 
published in English by 30 October 2021. The following electronic databases will 
be searched: Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Scopus. A 
search of grey literature will be conducted via an online search of Google 
Scholar, WorldCat, ClinicalTrials.gov and OpenGrey A combined search strategy 
using medical subject headings (MeSH), controlled vocabulary and 'free-text' 
terms will be appropriately revised to suit each database. Primary outcomes will 
include patient and caregiver perspectives on diabetes management regarding 
glucose control; living with CGM (quality of life, experience of wearing a CGM); 
psychological aspects (anxiety, depression, emotional burden); barriers 
(technical issues, financial issues) to use of CGM and thoughts (interpretation, 
understanding) on the CGM report. A qualitative meta-synthesis will be conducted 
employing a systematic literature search of existing literature, quality 
assessment using study-specific tools and an aggregative thematic synthesis by a 
multidisciplinary team.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required since this is a 
systematic review. The results will help improve clinical implementation of CGMs 
on part of both patients and caregivers.
