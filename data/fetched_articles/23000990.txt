Virus-like particles (VLPs) have emerged as important and versatile 
architectures for chemical manipulation in the development of functional hybrid 
nanostructures. Here we demonstrate a successful site-selective initiation of 
atom-transfer radical polymerization reactions to form an addressable polymer 
constrained within the interior cavity of a VLP. Potentially, this 
protein-polymer hybrid of P22 and cross-linked poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) 
could be useful as a new high-density delivery vehicle for the encapsulation and 
delivery of small-molecule cargos. In particular, the encapsulated polymer can 
act as a scaffold for the attachment of small functional molecules, such as 
fluorescein dye or the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent 
Gd-diethylenetriaminepentacetate, through reactions with its pendant primary 
amine groups. Using this approach, a significant increase in the labelling 
density of the VLP, compared to that of previous modifications of VLPs, can be 
achieved. These results highlight the use of multimeric protein-polymer 
conjugates for their potential utility in the development of VLP-based MRI 
contrast agents with the possibility of loading other cargos.
