Biochemical and pharmacological studies have suggested that NOS2 (inducible 
nitric oxide synthase) has a functional role in the blood pressure response to 
increases in dietary salt intake. On a high-salt diet, the Dahl/Rapp 
salt-sensitive (S) strain of rat, a genetic model of salt-sensitive 
hypertension, did not show increased nitric oxide production. NOS2 from S rats 
possesses a point mutation that results in substitution of proline for serine at 
position 714. In the present study, rat NOS2 was shown to be ubiquitinated in 
vitro and in vivo and to be degraded by the proteasome; this process was 
accelerated for the S714P mutant. Accelerated degradation of the S714P mutant 
enzyme accounted for the diminished enzyme activity of this mutant. Hsp90 
(heat-shock protein 90) associated with NOS2 and modulated degradation, but was 
not responsible for the accentuated degradation of the S714P mutant enzyme. The 
combined findings demonstrate the integral role of ubiquitination and 
degradation by the proteasome in the regulation of NO production by rat NOS2. 
Demonstrating that this process is responsible for the abnormal function of the 
S714P mutant NOS2 in S rats confirms the physiological importance of the 
proteasome in NOS2 function.
