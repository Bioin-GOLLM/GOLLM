The incorporation of fluorine can not only significantly facilitate the study of 
proteins but also potentially modulate their function. Though some biosynthetic 
methods allow global residue-replacement, post-translational fluorine 
incorporation would constitute a fast and efficient alternative. Here, we reveal 
a mild method for direct protein radical trifluoromethylation at native residues 
as a strategy for symmetric-multifluorine incorporation on mg scales with high 
recoveries. High selectivity toward tryptophan residues enhanced the utility of 
this direct trifluoromethylation technique allowing ready study of fluorinated 
protein constructs using 19F-NMR.
