BACKGROUND: Beta thalassemia represents a great heterogeneity as over 300 
mutations have been identified and each population at-risk has its own spectrum 
of mutations. Molecular characterization with high accuracy, sensitivity and 
economics is required for population screening and genetic counseling.
METHODS: We used the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) platform to develop novel 
multiplex assays for comprehensive detection of 27 mutations in beta-thalassemia 
patients. Six multiplex assays were designed to detect 13 common known 
ß-mutations, namely CD41/42, CD71/72, IVS1-5, IVS1-1, CD26, IVS2-654, CAP+1, 
CD19, -28, -29, IVS1-2, InCD (T-G) and CD17; and 14 rare ß-mutations, i.e. InCD 
(A-C), CD8/9, CD43, -86, CD15, Poly A, Poly T/C, IVS2-1, CD1, CD35/36, CD27/28, 
CD16, CD37, and 619bpDEL in 165 samples. We compared the efficiencies of 
genotyping by MS and Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS). Discrepant 
results were confirmed by sequencing analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 88.7% (260/293 allele) of MS and ARMS results was in 
agreement. More than fifty percent of the discrepant result was due to the false 
interpretation of ARMS results. Failed CD19 assay by MS method might be due to 
the assay design. The MS method detected 5 rare ß-mutations (CD15, CD35/36, 
CD8/9, Poly A and Poly T/C) presented in 13 alleles, which were not included in 
the ARMS screening panel.
CONCLUSION: We revealed that the MS method is a sensitive, high-throughput, 
highly automated, flexible, and cost-effective alternative to conventional 
ß-thalassemia genotyping methods.
