Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) is a human oncovirus. KSHV 
relies on manipulating the host cell N6-methyl adenosine (m6A) RNA modification 
pathway to enhance virus replication. Methylation within a RNA stem loop of the 
open reading frame 50 (ORF50) increases transcript stability via the recruitment 
of the m6A reader, SND1. In this contribution we explore the energy landscapes 
of the unmethylated and methylated RNA stem loops of ORF50 to investigate the 
effect of methylation on the structure of the stem loop. We observe a 
significant shift upon methylation between an open and closed configuration of 
the top of the stem loop. In the unmethylated stem loop the closed configuration 
is much lower in energy, and, as a result, exhibits higher occupancy.
