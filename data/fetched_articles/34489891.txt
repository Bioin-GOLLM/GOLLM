Rabies, a fatal disease in humans and other mammals, is caused by the rabies 
virus (RABV), and it poses a public health threat in many parts of the world. 
Once symptoms of rabies appear, the mortality is near 100%. There is currently 
no effective treatment for rabies. In our study, two human-derived 
RABV-neutralizing antibodies (RVNA), CR57 and CR4098, were cloned into 
adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, and recombinant AAVs expressing RVNA were 
evaluated for postexposure prophylaxis after intrathecal injection into 
RABV-infected rats. At 4days post-infection with a lethal dose of RABV, 60% of 
the rats that received an intrathecal injection of AAV-CR57 survived, while 100% 
of the rats inoculated with AAV-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 
succumbed to rabies. Overall, these results demonstrate that AAV-encoding RVNA 
can be utilized as a potential human rabies postexposure prophylaxis.
