We have used a two-hybrid approach to test various forms of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae Ras2p for their ability to interact with the human guanine nucleotide 
exchange factor HGRF55. We have previously shown that a strong two-hybrid 
interaction is found between the HGRF55p and the dominant negative Ras2p(G22A) 
form of ras [Camus et al. (1995) Oncogene 11, 951-959]. We show here that the 
substitution N123I which weakens the guanine nucleotide binding also promotes 
ras-GEF interaction. We demonstrate that the R80D substitution alone completely 
abolishes the interaction of Ras2p(G22A) with GEF, whereas substitutions at 
positions 81, 82 and 73 have only small effects. Since residue 73 is involved in 
the response of ras to GEF, we propose that it plays a role in the 
conformational change induced by the GEF rather than in its binding. Those 
results emphasize the role of the alpha2 helix of the switch II region in the 
recognition of the GEF family.
