BACKGROUND: Development of interleukin (IL)-2-dependent antitumor responses 
focus on targeting the intermediate affinity IL-2R to stimulate 
memory-phenotypic CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells while minimizing 
regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion. However, this approach may not effectively 
engage tumor-specific T effector cells. Since tumor-antigen specific T cells 
upregulate the high-affinity IL-2R, we tested an IL-2 biologic, mouse IL-2/CD25, 
with selectivity toward the high-affinity IL-2R to support antitumor responses 
to tumors that vary in their immunogenicity.
METHODS: Mice were first implanted with either CT26, MC38, B16.F10, or 4T1 and 
after a tumor mass developed, they were treated with high-dose (HD) mouse 
(m)IL-2/CD25 alone or in combination with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 
(PD-1) checkpoint blockade. Tumor growth was monitored and in parallel the 
immune signature in the tumor microenvironment (TME) was determined by a 
combination of multiparameter flow cytometry, functional assays, and enumeration 
of tumor-reactive T cells.
RESULTS: We show that HD mIL-2/CD25, which preferentially stimulates the 
high-affinity IL-2R, but not IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes with preferential activity 
toward the intermediate-affinity IL-2R, supports vigorous antitumor responses to 
immunogenic tumors as a monotherapy that were enhanced when combined with 
anti-PD-1. Treatment of CT26-bearing mice with HD mIL-2/CD25 led to a high 
CD8+:Treg ratio in the TME, increased frequency and function of tumor-specific 
CD8+ T effector cells with a less exhausted phenotype, and antitumor memory 
responses.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeting the high-affinity IL-2R on tumor-specific T cells with HD 
mIL-2/CD25 alone or with PD-1 blockade supports antitumor responses, where the 
resulting memory response may afford long-term protection against tumor 
re-emergence.
