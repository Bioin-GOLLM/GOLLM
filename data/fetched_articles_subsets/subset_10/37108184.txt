Under physiological conditions, skin mast cells play an important role as 
guardians that quickly react to stimuli that disturb homeostasis. These cells 
efficiently support, fight infection, and heal the injured tissue. The 
substances secreted by mast cells allow for communication inside the body, 
including the immune, nervous, and blood systems. Pathologically non-cancerous 
mast cells participate in allergic processes but also may promote the 
development of autoinflammatory or neoplastic disease. In this article, we 
review the current literature regarding the role of mast cells in 
autoinflammatory, allergic, neoplastic skin disease, as well as the importance 
of these cells in systemic diseases with a pronounced course with skin symptoms.
