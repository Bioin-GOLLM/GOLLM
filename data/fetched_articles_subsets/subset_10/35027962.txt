Leptin is a hormone derived from adipose tissue and the small intestine, mainly 
in enterocytes; it helps regulate the energy balance by suppressing hunger, 
resulting in decreased fat mass in adipocytes. Leptin has specific receptors in 
the ventromedial and arcuate nuclei and other parts of the hypothalamus and the 
feeding center in the ventral tegmental area. It also plays a role in regulatory 
aspects other than fat cells, such as obesity, which is linked to a loss of 
sensitivity of leptin receptors, resulting in an inability to produce satiety 
and an increase in food intake. Moreover, leptin plays a part in lactation, bone 
density, the immune system, diabetes treatments, and hypertriglyceridemia. The 
latest studies in leptin suggest that an analog of leptin may treat DM and 
hypertriglyceridemia. Further research should be conducted on the effectiveness 
of leptin on other related diseases.
