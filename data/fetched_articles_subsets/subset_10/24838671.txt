Cytokines play critical roles in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus infection 
(HBV). This work was designed to study the effect of IL-10 gene polymorphisms 
(-1082G/A and -819C/T) on susceptibility of Egyptians to HBV. Genotyping was 
performed using single-stranded polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction in 118 
Egyptian hepatitis B patients and 119 healthy controls, and IL-10 serum levels 
were measured using ELISA. The frequency of IL-10 -1082G/G was significantly 
higher in HBV patients than in healthy controls, and G/A and A/A were not 
significantly different between groups. The distribution of IL-10 -819 genotypes 
was not significantly different between the HBV and healthy control groups. 
Although AT was significantly different between controls and patients, the 
distribution of the other haplotypes was not. IL-10 levels were significantly 
lower among hepatitis B patients. Our data stress the importance of IL-10 gene 
polymorphism in HBV infection. Depending on our preliminary work, IL-10 -1082G/G 
may act as a host genetic factor in the susceptibility to HBV infection in 
Egyptians.
