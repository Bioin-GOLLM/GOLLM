OBJECT: The aim of this paper was to define the clinical characteristics of 
spinal ependymomas associated with neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2).
METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients 
with NF2 who had imaging findings consistent with ependymomas and were seen at 
Massachusetts General Hospital between 1994 and 2007. Clinical characteristics 
of these patients were obtained from hospital records, imaging studies, surgical 
reports, and pathology reports. Mutational analysis of the NF2 gene was 
performed in 37 of 44 unrelated patients.
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients met inclusion criteria for the study. The median 
age at diagnosis of NF2 was 21 years; the median time after diagnosis until 
identification of ependymomas was 5 years. Multiple ependymomas were present in 
58% of patients. The most common site of involvement was the cervical cord or 
cervicomedullary junction (86% of imaging studies), followed by the thoracic and 
lumbar cords (62% and 8%, respectively). The majority of patients had no 
symptoms related to their tumors (42 patients [76%]). After a median follow-up 
of 50 months, surgery was performed in 11 patients (20%) for symptomatic 
progression (indications for surgery). Mutational analysis of the NF2 gene 
detected alterations in 28 (76%) of 37 unrelated patients, with nonsense and 
frameshift mutations accounting for 64% of detected mutations. The high rate of 
truncating mutations may help explain the high tumor burden in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurofibromatosis Type 2-related ependymomas exhibit an indolent 
growth pattern with tumor progression limited to a minority of patients. The 
authors believe that surveillance is reasonable for asymptomatic ependymomas, 
including those with cystic areas that expand the cord. For symptomatic tumors, 
resection may be warranted depending on age, overall clinical status, and ease 
of resectability.
