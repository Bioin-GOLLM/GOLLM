OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the associations between 
polymorphisms of the human SA (SAH) gene, an acyl-CoA synthetase gene, with 
dyslipidemia and phenotypes of the insulin resistance syndrome in postmenopausal 
women.
METHODS: One hundred and forty-two postmenopausal women were recruited for the 
study. Each subject received anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, 
fasting sampling for lipids, and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test for insulin 
resistance. Genotypes of two polymorphisms in the promoter region 
(c.-962ins/del, c.-451G>A), one missense variant (c.1077G>C, p.K359N) in exon 8, 
and one in intron 12 (A>G) of the SAH gene, were determined.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in genetic distribution of the SAH 
gene promoter I/D polymorphism between the two groups of subjects by 
non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels (p=0.004). The 
subjects with the DD genotype was associated with high levels of non-HDL-C (>160 
mg/dL) as compared with the ID or II genotypes (p=0.002). Furthermore, three 
haplotypes were constructed based on the promoter I/D and the exon 8 G/C 
polymorphisms. Homozygosity for SAH haplotype 3 was associated with increased 
adiposity, insulin resistance, and elevated levels of non-HDL-C in the post 
menopausal women. The subjects with haplotype 3 had double the risk to have 
higher non-HDL-C levels than those with haplotype 1.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the polymorphisms of the SAH gene are 
associated with non-HDL-C levels in postmenopausal women. Further studies with 
larger sample sizes or different populations are warranted to confirm our 
preliminary findings.
