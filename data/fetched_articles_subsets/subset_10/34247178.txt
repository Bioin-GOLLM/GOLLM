This is a case report of a girl with glutaric acidemia type I (GA-I) who 
experienced rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury (AKI). Her first acute 
metabolic crisis occurred at the age of 5 months, which mainly manifested as 
irritable crying, poor appetite, and hyperlactatemia. Mutation analysis showed 2 
pathogenic mutations in the glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) gene, which were 
c.383G>A (p.R128Q) and c.873delC (p.N291Kfs*41), the latter of which is a novel 
frameshift mutation of GA-I. She had a febrile illness at the age of 12 months, 
followed by AKI and severe rhabdomyolysis. Four days of continuous venovenous 
hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) helped to overcome this acute decompensation. This 
case report describes a novel mutation in the GCDH gene, that is, c.873delC 
(p.N291Kfs*41). Also, it highlights the fact that patients with GA-I have a high 
risk of rhabdomyolysis and AKI, which may be induced by febrile diseases and 
hyperosmotic dehydration; CVVHDF can help to overcome this acute decompensation.
