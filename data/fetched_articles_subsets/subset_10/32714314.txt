Streptococcus pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for widespread 
illness and is a major global health issue for children, the elderly, and the 
immunocompromised population. Pneumolysin (PLY) is a cholesterol-dependent 
cytolysin (CDC) and key pneumococcal virulence factor involved in all phases of 
pneumococcal disease, including transmission, colonization, and infection. In 
this review we cover the biology and cytolytic function of PLY, its contribution 
to S. pneumoniae pathogenesis, and its known interactions and effects on the 
host with regard to tissue damage and immune response. Additionally, we review 
statins as a therapeutic option for CDC toxicity and PLY toxoid as a vaccine 
candidate in protein-based vaccines.
