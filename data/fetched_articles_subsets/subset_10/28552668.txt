Chronic pulmonary colonization with bacterial pathogens, particularly 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in 
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We observed that β1-integrins accumulate on 
the luminal membrane of upper-airway epithelial cells from mice and humans with 
CF. β1-integrin accumulation is due to increased ceramide and the formation of 
ceramide platforms that trap β1-integrins on the luminal pole of 
bronchial epithelial cells. β1-integrins downregulate acid ceramidase 
expression, resulting in further accumulation of ceramide and consequent 
reduction of surface sphingosine, a lipid that kills bacteria. Interrupting this 
vicious cycle by triggering surface β1-integrin internalization via 
anti-β1-integrin antibodies or the RGD peptide ligand-or by genetic or 
pharmacological correction of ceramide levels-normalizes β1-integrin 
distribution and sphingosine levels in CF epithelial cells and prevents 
P. aeruginosa infection in CF mice. These findings suggest a therapeutic avenue 
to ameliorate CF-associated bacterial infections.
