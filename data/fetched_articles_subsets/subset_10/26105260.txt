INTRODUCTION: We have successfully utilized a family-based study design to 
localize several positional candidate preeclampsia susceptibility genes to 
chromosomes 2q22(ACVR2A,LCT,LRP1B,RND3,GCA),5q (ERAP2) and 13q(TNFSF13B). We now 
report on our continued positional cloning efforts using an alternative 
genome-wide association (GWA) mapping strategy in large Caucasian case-control 
cohorts from Australia and Norway.
OBJECTIVES: To identify maternal genetic risk loci for preeclampsia.
METHODS: The unrelated Australian samples (545 cases,547 controls) were 
genotyped using Illumina BeadChip technology (700K loci) and have been analyzed 
using PLINK. All unrelated Norwegian samples were genotyped across several 
Illumina BeadChip substrates and consist of 847 cases (700K loci) and 638 
controls. The Norwegian control samples originate from other HUNT studies 
pertaining to migraine (n=95,700K loci), lung cancer (n=89,370K loci) and normal 
brain pathology (n=454,2.5M loci). To analyze a concordant set of 2.5-3 million 
genotypes across all Norwegian samples we are currently using MaCH to impute 
those loci not directly genotyped. The Norwegian GWA data will be analyzed in 
SOLAR utilizing empirical kinship estimates to account for any distant 
relatedness.
RESULTS: 1078 Australian samples (538 cases,540 controls) and 648, 175 SNPs 
passed our quality control metrics. Two SNP associations 
(rs7579169,p=3.6×10(-7); rs12711941,p=4.3×10(-7)) satisfied our genome-wide 
significant threshold (p<5.1×10(-7)). These SNPs reside less than 15kb 
downstream from the 3 terminus of the Inhibin, beta B (INHBB) gene on 2q14.2. 
Sequencing of the INHBB locus in our patient cohort identified a third 
intergenic SNP to significantly associate with preeclampsia 
(rs7576192,p=1.5×10(-7)). These three SNPs confer risk (OR>1.56) and are in 
strong linkage disequilibrium with each other (r(2)>0.9) but not with any other 
genotyped SNP ±200kb. The analysis of the Norwegian GWAS is underway.
CONCLUSION: The Australian GWAS has identified a novel preeclampsia risk locus 
on chromosome 2q. The INHBB gene closest to our SNP associations is a plausible 
positional candidate susceptibility gene. There is a substantive body of 
evidence implicating inhibins, activins and other members of the 
TGF-βsuperfamily to have a role in the development of preeclampsia. The 
biological connection between ACVR2A and INHBB leads us to speculate that our 
linkage-based and GWA-based study designs, respectively, have identified a key 
biological pathway involved in susceptibility to preeclampsia.
