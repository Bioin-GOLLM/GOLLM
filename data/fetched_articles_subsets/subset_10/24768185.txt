OBJECTIVE: This study is to investigate the role of glucose-regulated protein 78 
(GRP78) in the pulmonary microvascular remodeling during hepatopulmonary 
syndrome (HPS) development.
METHODS: The rat models with liver cirrhosis and HPS were induced by multiple 
pathogenic factors for 4 to 8 wk. The concentrations of alanine transferase 
(ALT) and endotoxin in plasma were detected in the models, followed by the 
detection of GRP78 expression. RT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR and Western 
blotting were employed to assess the mRNA and protein expression levels of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), respectively. Immunohistochemistry 
staining was used to examine the expression of a specific vascular marker, 
factor VIII-related antigen (FVIII-RAg), and several cell proliferation- and 
apoptosis-related proteins, including CHOP/GADD153, caspase-12, Bcl-2 and 
nuclear factor (NF)-κB.
RESULTS: The levels of endotoxin and ALT in plasma were gradually increased as 
the disease progressed, so did GRP78, which were in a positive correlation. The 
expression levels of VEGF (both mRNA and protein) and FVIII-RAg were 
significantly elevated in the HPS models, indicating active angiogenesis, which 
was also positively correlated with GRP78 expression. Furthermore, the 
expression levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins of CHOP/GADD153 and caspase-12 
were dramatically decreased, while the anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 and 
NF-κB were significantly elevated, in the HPS models. There were also close 
correlation between these proteins and GRP78.
CONCLUSIONS: Over-expression of GRP78 in lungs may be the critical pathogenic 
factor for HPS. Through promoting cell proliferation and survival and inhibiting 
apoptosis, GRP78 may promote the pulmonary microvascular remodeling in HPS 
pathogenesis. Our results provide a potential therapeutic target for clinical 
prevention and treatment for HPS and related complications.
