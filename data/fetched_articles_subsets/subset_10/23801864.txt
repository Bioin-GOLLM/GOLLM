AIM: To investigate the risk association of xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) 
Lys939Gln polymorphism alone and in combination with cigarette smoking on 
colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition.
METHODS: Peripheral blood samples of 510 study subjects (255 CRC patients, 255 
controls)were collected. DNA was extracted and genotyping was performed using 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The 
association between polymorphic genotype and CRC predisposition was determined 
using the OR and 95%CI.
RESULTS: The frequency of the homozygous variant (Gln/Gln) genotype was 
significantly higher in cases compared with controls (16.0% vs 10.2%, P = 
0.049). The Gln/Gln genotype of XPC showed a significantly higher association 
with the risk of CRC (OR = 1.884; 95%CI: 1.082-3.277; P = 0.025). In the case of 
allele frequencies, variant allele C was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of CRC (OR = 1.375; 95%CI: 1.050-1.802; P = 0.020). Moreover, the 
risk was markedly higher for those who were carriers of the Gln/Gln variant 
genotype and were also cigarette smokers (OR = 3.409; 95%CI: 1.061-10.949; P = 
0.032).
CONCLUSION: The XPC Gln/Gln genotype alone and in combination with smoking 
increases the risk of CRC among Malaysians.
