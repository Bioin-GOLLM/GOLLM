Inhibition of Arabidopsis growth by the allelopathic compound 
azetidine-2-carboxylate is due to the low amino acid specificity of cytosolic 
prolyl-tRNA synthetase.

The toxicity of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (A2C), a structural analogue of 
L-proline, results from its incorporation into proteins due to misrecognition by 
prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS). The growth of Arabidopsis thaliana seedling 
roots is more sensitive to inhibition by A2C than is cotyledon growth. 
Arabidopsis contains two ProRS isozymes. AtProRS-Org (At5g52520) is localized in 
chloroplasts/mitochondria, and AtProRS-Cyt (At3g62120) is cytosolic. AtProRS-Cyt 
mRNA is more highly expressed in roots than in cotyledons. Arabidopsis ProRS 
isoforms were expressed as His-tagged recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. 
Both enzymes were functionally active in ATP-PPi exchange and aminoacylation 
assays, and showed similar Km for L-proline. A major difference was observed in 
the substrate specificity of the two enzymes. AtProRS-Cyt showed nearly 
identical substrate specificity for L-proline and A2C, but for AtProRS-Org the 
specificity constant was 77.6 times higher for L-proline than A2C, suggesting 
that A2C-sensitivity may result from lower amino acid specificity of 
AtProRS-Cyt. Molecular modelling and simulation results indicate that this 
specificity difference between the AtProRS isoforms may result from altered 
modes of substrate binding. Similar kinetic results were obtained with the 
ProRSs from Zea mays, suggesting that the difference in substrate specificity is 
a conserved feature of ProRS isoforms from plants that do not accumulate A2C and 
are sensitive to A2C toxicity. The discovery of the mode of action of A2C 
toxicity could lead to development of biorational weed management strategies.
