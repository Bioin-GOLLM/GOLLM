BACKROUND: Accurate surrogate parameters for radio resistance are warranted for 
individualized radiotherapy (RT) concepts in prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose 
of this study was to assess intertumoral heterogeneity in terms of radio 
resistance using an ex-vivo γH2AX assay after irradiation of prostate biopsy 
cores and to investigate its correlation with clinical features of respective 
patients as well as imaging and genomic features of tumor areas.
METHODS: Twenty one patients with histologically-proven PCa and pre-therapeutic 
multiparametric resonance imaging and prostate-specific membrane antigen 
positron emission tomography were included in the study. Biopsy cores were 
collected from 26 PCa foci. Residual γH2AX foci were counted 24 h after ex-vivo 
irradiation (with 0 and 4 Gy) of biopsy specimen and served as a surrogate for 
radio resistance. Clinical, genomic (next generation sequencing) and imaging 
features were collected and their association with the radio resistance was 
studied.
RESULTS: In total 18 PCa lesions from 16 patients were included in the final 
analysis. The median γH2AX foci value per PCa lesion was 3.12. According to 
this, the patients were divided into two groups (radio sensitive vs. radio 
resistant) with significant differences in foci number (p < 0.0001). The 
patients in the radio sensitive group had significantly higher prostate specific 
antigen serum concentration (p = 0.015), tumor areas in the radio sensitive 
group had higher SUV (standardized uptake values in PSMA PET)-max and -mean 
values (p = 0.0037, p = 0.028) and lower ADC (apparent diffusion 
coefficient-mean values, p = 0.049). All later parameters had significant 
(p < 0.05) correlations in Pearson's test. One patient in the radio sensitive 
group displayed a previously not reported loss of function frameshift mutation 
in the NBN gene (c.654_658delAAAAC) that introduces a premature termination 
codon and results in a truncated protein.
CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, significant differences in intertumoral radio 
resistance were observed and clinical as well as imaging parameters may be 
applied for their prediction. After further prospective validation in larger 
patient cohorts these finding may lead to individual RT dose prescription for 
PCa patients in the future.
