Numerous studies focusing on genetic variants in order to find cetuximab 
subpopulation biomarkers have emerged, yet the significance of each biomarker is 
diverse. Based on these results, we carried out a meta-analysis to assess the 
correlation between epidermal growth factor (EGF) A61G polymorphism and clinical 
outcomes of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with cetuximab. 
We aim to prove that EGF polymorphisms may be potential biomarkers for cetuximab 
therapeutic strategies. We identified 6 previously published studies including 
569 patients treated with cetuximab-based regimens. Outcomes included clinical 
response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). GG 
homozygote showed association with better response rates (GG vs. AA+AG, OR = 
2.82; 95% CI = 1.58-5.04) and than AA+AG genotypes. This meta-analysis showed 
that mCRC patients harboring GG genotype of EGF A61G polymorphism inclined to 
have a better response rate with cetuximab treatment.
