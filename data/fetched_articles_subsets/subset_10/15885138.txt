BACKGROUND: Common genetic variation at genes that are imprinted and exclusively 
maternally expressed could explain the apparent maternal-specific inheritance of 
low birthweight reported in large family pedigrees. We identified ten single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in H19, and we genotyped three of these SNPs in 
families from the contemporary ALSPAC UK birth cohort (1,696 children, 822 
mothers and 661 fathers) in order to explore associations with size at birth and 
cord blood IGF-II levels.
RESULTS: Both offspring's and mother's H19 2992C>T SNP genotypes showed 
associations with offspring birthweight (P = 0.03 to P = 0.003) and mother's 
genotype was also associated with cord blood IGF-II levels (P = 0.0003 to P = 
0.0001). The offspring genotype association with birthweight was independent of 
mother's genotype (P = 0.01 to P = 0.007). However, mother's untransmitted H19 
2992T allele was also associated with larger birthweight (P = 0.04) and higher 
cord blood IGF-II levels (P = 0.002), suggesting a direct effect of mother's 
genotype on placental IGF-II expression and fetal growth. The association 
between mother's untransmitted allele and cord blood IGF-II levels was more 
apparent in offspring of first pregnancies than subsequent pregnancies 
(P-interaction = 0.03). Study of the independent Cambridge birth cohort with 
available DNA in mothers (N = 646) provided additional support for mother's H19 
2992 genotype associations with birthweight (P = 0.04) and with mother's glucose 
levels (P = 0.01) in first pregnancies.
CONCLUSION: The common H19 2992T allele, in the mother or offspring or both, may 
confer reduced fetal growth restraint, as indicated by associations with larger 
offspring birth size, higher cord blood IGF-II levels, and lower compensatory 
early postnatal catch-up weight gain, that are more evident among mother's 
smaller first-born infants.
