BACKGROUND: Cells have evolved quality control mechanisms to ensure protein 
homeostasis by detecting and degrading aberrant mRNAs and proteins. A common 
source of aberrant mRNAs is premature polyadenylation, which can result in 
non-functional protein products. Translating ribosomes that encounter poly(A) 
sequences are terminally stalled, followed by ribosome recycling and decay of 
the truncated nascent polypeptide via ribosome-associated quality control.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that the conserved RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase 
Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) promotes ribosome stalling at poly(A) 
sequences during ribosome-associated quality control. We show that MKRN1 
directly binds to the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1) and 
associates with polysomes. MKRN1 is positioned upstream of poly(A) tails in 
mRNAs in a PABPC1-dependent manner. Ubiquitin remnant profiling and in vitro 
ubiquitylation assays uncover PABPC1 and ribosomal protein RPS10 as direct 
ubiquitylation substrates of MKRN1.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that MKRN1 mediates the recognition of poly(A) tails to 
prevent the production of erroneous proteins from prematurely polyadenylated 
transcripts, thereby maintaining proteome integrity.
