The involvement of alterations in MLH1, an essential mismatch repair component, 
in BRAFV600E mutated papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has been suggested to be 
associated with features of tumor aggressiveness. Thirty-two PTC and surrounding 
normal thyroid tissues were evaluated for 11 representative DNA repair genes 
expression. BRAFV600E mutational status assessment and clinicopathological 
correlations were evaluated for their gene and protein expression. BRAFV600E PTC 
is associated with lower levels of XPD and MLH1 gene expression. Decrease in 
MLH1 and XPD mRNA levels in BRAFV600E PTC (but not their protein products) are 
associated with predictors of poor patient outcomes. Considering the complete 
subset of patients, MGMT and XRCC2 genes were shown down and upregulated, 
respectively, in PTC tissues. Low expression of MGMT gene and weak XRCC2 protein 
expression were correlated with characteristics of tumor aggressiveness. These 
results suggest that an imbalance in DNA repair gene expression in PTC is 
associated with aggressive clinicopathological features and BRAFV600E mutation.
