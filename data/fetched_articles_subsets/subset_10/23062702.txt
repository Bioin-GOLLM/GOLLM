Mutations in TAR DNA-binding protein (TARDBP) are associated with heterogenic 
phenotypes, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, 
and Parkinson's disease. In this study, we investigated the presence of TARDBP 
mutations in a cohort of 429 Dutch patients with Parkinson's disease. Though we 
detected 1 silent mutation, p.S332S, no missense mutations were present in our 
cohort. Our findings, therefore, demonstrate that TARDBP mutations do not appear 
to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease in The Netherlands.
