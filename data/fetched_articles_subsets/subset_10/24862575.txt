Cytoplasmic linker-associated proteins (CLASPs) are proposed to function in cell 
division based on their ability to bind tubulin via arrayed tumor overexpressed 
gene (TOG)-like (TOGL) domains. Structure predictions suggest that CLASPs have 
at least two TOGL domains. We show that only TOGL2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
CLASP Stu1 binds to tubulin and is required for polymerization of spindle 
microtubules (MTs) in vivo. In contrast, TOGL1 recruits Stu1 to kinetochores 
(KTs), where it is essential for the stability and tension-dependent regulation 
of KT MTs. Stu1 is also recruited to spindle MTs by different mechanisms 
depending on the mitotic phase: in metaphase, Stu1 binds directly to the MT 
lattice, whereas in anaphase, it is localized indirectly to the spindle midzone. 
In both phases, the activity of TOGL2 is essential for interpolar MT stability, 
whereas TOGL1 is not involved. Thus, the two TOGL domains of yeast CLASP have 
different activities and execute distinct mitotic functions.
