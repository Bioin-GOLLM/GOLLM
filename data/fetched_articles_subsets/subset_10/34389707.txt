In bacteria, trans-translation is the main rescue system, freeing ribosomes 
stalled on defective messenger RNAs. This mechanism is driven by small protein B 
(SmpB) and transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), a hybrid RNA known to have both a 
tRNA-like and an mRNA-like domain. Here we present four cryo-EM structures of 
the ribosome during trans-translation at resolutions from 3.0 to 3.4 Å. These 
include the high-resolution structure of the whole pre-accommodated state, as 
well as structures of the accommodated state, the translocated state, and a 
translocation intermediate. Together, they shed light on the movements of the 
tmRNA-SmpB complex in the ribosome, from its delivery by the elongation factor 
EF-Tu to its passage through the ribosomal A and P sites after the opening of 
the B1 bridges. Additionally, we describe the interactions between the 
tmRNA-SmpB complex and the ribosome. These explain why the process does not 
interfere with canonical translation.
