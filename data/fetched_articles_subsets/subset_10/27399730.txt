Two new sesterterpenes analogs, namely, 12-acetoxy,16-epi-hyrtiolide (1) and 
12β-acetoxy,16β-methoxy,20α-hydroxy-17-scalaren-19,20-olide (2), containing a 
scalarane-based framework along with seven previously reported scalarane-type 
sesterterpenes (3-9) have been isolated from the sponge Hyrtios erectus (order 
Dictyoceratida) collected from the Red Sea, Egypt. The structures of the 
isolated compounds were elucidated on the basis of their spectroscopic data and 
comparison with reported NMR data. Compounds 1-9 exhibited considerable 
antiproliferative activity against breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), colorectal 
carcinoma (HCT-116) and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). Compounds 3, 5 
and 9 were selected for subsequent investigations regarding their mechanism of 
cell death induction (differential apoptosis/necrosis assessment) and their 
influence on cell cycle distribution.
