CONCLUSIONS: In the samples of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and 
neck region studied, mutations of exon 2 were quite rare. In contrast to the 
other three mutations, the G to C transversion on position 169 (Ala57Pro) has 
been found in several other studies before. Further investigations on mutations 
of the other exons 1alpha, 1beta and 3 are necessary.
OBJECTIVE: Alterations of p16(INK4A) have been found in different types of human 
cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to perform a screening for 
alterations of exon 2 of different SCCs of the head and neck region.
METHODS: Forty samples of different SCCs of the head and neck were collected by 
biopsy or surgical resection. Exon 2 was amplified by using the primers 
5'-GGTGAGGGGGCTCTACACAAG-3' and 5'-GTCTCCCGGGCTGAACTTTC-3'. DNA was sequenced 
with the primer 5'-CGGGCTGAACTTTCTGTGCT-3'.
RESULTS: Mutations were found in 4 of our 40 samples. One sample showed a G to C 
transversion on position 169 (Ala57Pro), a second sample from the same patient 
confirmed the latter transition but also contained a transition C to T on 
position 179 (Ala60Val). Another patient showed an already known polymorphism, a 
transition G to A at position 442 (Ala148Thr). The third case was a transversion 
C to A on position 213 (Asn71Lys).
