Four Burkholderia pseudomallei-like isolates of human clinical origin were 
examined by a polyphasic taxonomic approach that included comparative whole 
genome analyses. The results demonstrated that these isolates represent a rare 
and unusual, novel Burkholderia species for which we propose the name B. 
singularis. The type strain is LMG 28154T (=CCUG 65685T). Its genome sequence 
has an average mol% G+C content of 64.34%, which is considerably lower than that 
of other Burkholderia species. The reduced G+C content of strain LMG 28154T was 
characterized by a genome wide AT bias that was not due to reduced GC-biased 
gene conversion or reductive genome evolution, but might have been caused by an 
altered DNA base excision repair pathway. B. singularis can be differentiated 
from other Burkholderia species by multilocus sequence analysis, MALDI-TOF mass 
spectrometry and a distinctive biochemical profile that includes the absence of 
nitrate reduction, a mucoid appearance on Columbia sheep blood agar, and a 
slowly positive oxidase reaction. Comparisons with publicly available whole 
genome sequences demonstrated that strain TSV85, an Australian water isolate, 
also represents the same species and therefore, to date, B. singularis has been 
recovered from human or environmental samples on three continents.
