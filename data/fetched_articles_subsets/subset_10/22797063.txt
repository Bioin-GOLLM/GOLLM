Homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) are two 
distinct DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair pathways. Here, we report that 
DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), the core component of NHEJ, partnering 
with DNA-damage checkpoint kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM- 
and Rad3-related (ATR), regulates HR repair of DSBs. The regulation was 
accomplished through modulation of the p53 and replication protein A (RPA) 
interaction. We show that upon DNA damage, p53 and RPA were freed from a p53-RPA 
complex by simultaneous phosphorylations of RPA at the N-terminus of RPA32 
subunit by DNA-PK and of p53 at Ser37 and Ser46 in a Chk1/Chk2-independent 
manner by ATR and ATM, respectively. Neither the phosphorylation of RPA nor of 
p53 alone could dissociate p53 and RPA. Furthermore, disruption of the release 
significantly compromised HR repair of DSBs. Our results reveal a mechanism for 
the crosstalk between HR repair and NHEJ through the co-regulation of p53-RPA 
interaction by DNA-PK, ATM and ATR.
