The first identification of the cholinesterase variants E1kE1k and E1kE1s is 
reported from a family study. The evidence is based on the biochemical 
parameters of enzymic activity, and dibucaine, fluoride and RO2 numbers. Two 
individuals appear to be homozygotes E1kE1k and two are heterozygotes E1kE1s 
with family evidence supportive of these genotypes. The heterozygotes E1kE1s 
will be sensitive to suxamethonium.
