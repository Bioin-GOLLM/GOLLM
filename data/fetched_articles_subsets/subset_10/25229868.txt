Cne1p is a yeast homolog of calnexin, which is a constituent of endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER)-associated protein quality control system in mammals. Cne1p may 
be involved in the degradation of misfolded lysozymes in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. To test this, c-Myc-tagged lysozymes were expressed in 
CNE1-deficient S. cerevisiae. The expression and secretion of an unstable 
lysozyme mutant G49N/D66H were enhanced and its intracellular localization was 
changed in the CNE1-deficient strain. Furthermore, when Cne1p was co-expressed 
with unstable lysozyme mutants (G49N/D66H, G49N/C76A, and K13D/G49N), its 
affinity to the misfolded mutant proteins was revealed by 
co-immunoprecipitation. The interaction with Cne1p was abrogated by the addition 
of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, indicating that N-linked 
carbohydrates might be necessary for protein binding to Cne1p. These results 
suggest that in yeasts, Cne1p interacts with misfolded lysozyme proteins 
possibly causing their retention in the ER and subsequent elimination via 
ER-associated degradation.
