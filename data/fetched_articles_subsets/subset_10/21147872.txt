Over the last decade, investigators have developed a clearer understanding of 
the genetic alterations underlying thyroid carcinogenesis. A number of 
biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of differentiated thyroid cancer have 
undergone intensive study, not only for their role in tumorigenesis, but also 
for their potential utility as diagnostic and prognostic indicators and 
therapeutic targets. This review summarizes the current literature surrounding 
BRAF and its significance in thyroid cancer. Further, we discuss how molecular 
analysis can be integrated into management algorithms for thyroid nodules and 
papillary thyroid cancer. We also review what is known, to date, about the 
association of BRAF and papillary microcarcinoma as well as using targeted 
therapies for BRAF as adjuvant treatment for metastatic papillary thyroid 
cancer.
