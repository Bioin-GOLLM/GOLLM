AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: SLC30A8 encodes a zinc transporter in the beta cell; 
individuals with a common missense variant (rs13266634; R325W) in SLC30A8 
demonstrate a lower early insulin response to glucose and an increased risk of 
type 2 diabetes. We hypothesised that zinc supplementation may improve insulin 
secretion in a genotype-dependent manner.
METHODS: We evaluated the early insulin response to glucose (using frequently 
sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testing) by R325W genotype before and 
after 14 days of supplementation with oral zinc acetate (50 mg elemental zinc) 
twice daily in healthy non-diabetic Amish individuals (N = 55).
RESULTS: Individuals with RW/WW genotypes (n = 32) had the lowest insulin 
response to glucose at 5 and 10 min at baseline (vs RR homozygotes [n = 23]). 
After zinc supplementation, the RW/WW group experienced 15% and 14% increases in 
the insulin response to glucose at 5 and 10 min, respectively (p â‰¤ 0.04), and, 
compared with RR homozygotes, experienced a 26% (p = 0.04) increase in insulin 
at 5 min. We observed reciprocal decreases in proinsulin:insulin in the RW/WW (p 
= 0.002) vs RR group (p = 0.048), suggesting a genotype-specific improvement in 
insulin processing.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Zinc supplementation appears to affect the early 
insulin response to glucose differentially by rs13266634 genotype and could be 
beneficial for diabetes prevention and/or treatment for some individuals based 
on SLC30A8 variation.
