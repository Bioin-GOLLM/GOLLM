Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
resulting from mutations in the NBS1 gene, which encodes for the DNA double 
strand break repair protein nibrin. NBS is clinically characterized by 
microcephaly, dysmorphic features, immunodeficiency, and increased 
susceptibility to malignancy, mainly of lymphoid origin. Here, we describe a 
7-year-old girl with NBS who is homozygous for the NBS1 698del4 mutation. She 
had been diagnosed with perianal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and experienced severe 
toxicity from chemotherapy. RMS arising perianally is extremely uncommon but has 
been previously described in two cases with NBS. The strong association of 
perianal RMS with NBS should, therefore, be considered when confronted with a 
perianal RMS, as this carries important clinical implications in terms of 
potential need for therapy modification and follow up investigations. In 
addition, it suggests a role for the NBS1 gene and the nibrin dependent pathway 
in the pathogenesis of RMS, especially those arising perianally.
