Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CF cells and tissues exhibit various 
mitochondrial abnormalities. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain 
elusive. Here, we examined the mechanisms through which CFTR regulates Bcl-2 
family proteins, which in turn regulate permeabilization of the mitochondrial 
outer membrane. Notably, inhibition of CFTR activated Bax and Bad, but inhibited 
Bcl-2. Moreover, degradation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and AKT increased significantly in CFTR-knockdown cells. 
Dysfunction of CFTR decreased heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) mRNA levels, and 
CFTR was found to interact with Hsp90. Inhibition of Hsp90 by SNX-2112 induced 
the degradation of phosphorylated AKT and ERK1/2 in Caco2 and HRT18 cells. These 
findings may help provide insights into the physiological role of CFTR in 
CF-related diseases.
