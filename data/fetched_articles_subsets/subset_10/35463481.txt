As viruses constantly change due to mutation, variants are expected to emerge 
demanding development of sensors capable of detecting multiple variants using 
one single sensor platform. Herein, we report the integration of a synthetic 
binder against SARS-CoV-2 with a nanoplasmonic-based sensing technology, which 
enables the successful detection of spike proteins of Alpha, Beta and Gamma 
variants of SARS CoV-2. The recognition event is achieved by specific 
nanostructured molecularly imprinted polymers (nanoMIPs), developed against a 
region of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein. The 
transduction is based on the principle of localized surface plasmon resonance 
(LSPR) associated with silver nanostructures. The nanoMIPs-functionalised LSPR 
sensor allows for the detection of all 3 protein variants with a limit of 
detection of 9.71 fM, 7.32 fM and 8.81 pM using wavelength shifts respectively 
for Alpha, Beta and Gamma spike protein variants. This can be achieved within 
30 min from the sample collection, both from blood and using nasal swab, thus 
making this sensor suitable for rapid detection of COVID-19. Additionally, the 
turnaround time for sensor development and validation can be completed in less 
than 8 weeks, making it suitable for addressing future pandemic needs without 
the requirement for biological binding agents, which is one of the bottlenecks 
to the supply chain in diagnostic devices.
