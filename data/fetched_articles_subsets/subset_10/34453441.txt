CONTEXT: Severe forms of growth hormone insensitivity (GHI) are characterized by 
extreme short stature, dysmorphism, and metabolic anomalies.
OBJECTIVE: This work aims to identify the genetic cause of growth failure in 3 
"classical" GHI individuals.
METHODS: A novel intronic growth hormone receptor gene (GHR) variant was 
identified, and in vitro splicing assays confirmed aberrant splicing. A 6Ω 
pseudoexon GHR vector and patient fibroblast analysis assessed the consequences 
of the novel pseudoexon inclusion and the impact on GHR function.
RESULTS: We identified a novel homozygous intronic GHR variant 
(g.5:42700940T > G, c.618+836T > G), 44 bp downstream of the previously 
recognized intronic 6Ψ GHR pseudoexon mutation in the index patient. Two 
siblings also harbored the novel intronic 6Ω pseudoexon GHR variant in compound 
heterozygosity with the known GHR c.181C > T (R43X) mutation. In vitro splicing 
analysis confirmed inclusion of a 151-bp mutant 6Ω pseudoexon not identified in 
wild-type constructs. Inclusion of the 6Ω pseudoexon causes a frameshift 
resulting in a nonfunctional truncated GHR lacking the transmembrane and 
intracellular domains. The truncated 6Ω pseudoexon protein demonstrated 
extracellular accumulation and diminished activation of STAT5B signaling 
following GH stimulation.
CONCLUSION: Novel GHR 6Ω pseudoexon inclusion results in loss of GHR function 
consistent with a severe GHI phenotype. This represents a novel mechanism of 
Laron syndrome and is the first deep intronic variant identified causing severe 
postnatal growth failure. The 2 kindreds originate from the same town in 
Campania, Southern Italy, implying common ancestry. Our findings highlight the 
importance of studying variation in deep intronic regions as a cause of 
monogenic disorders.
