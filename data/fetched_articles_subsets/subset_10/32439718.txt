We reported previously that, in budding yeast, transcription rate affects both 
the efficiency and fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing, especially of ribosomal 
protein transcripts. Here, we report that the majority of ribosomal protein 
transcripts with non-consensus 5' splice sites are spliced less efficiently when 
transcription is faster, and more efficiently with slower transcription. These 
results support the "window of opportunity" model, and we suggest a possible 
mechanism to explain these findings.
