Tumor cells frequently produce soluble factors that favor myelopoiesis and 
recruitment of myeloid cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME). Consequently, 
the TME of many cancer types is characterized by high infiltration of monocytes, 
macrophages, dendritic cells and granulocytes. Experimental and clinical studies 
show that most myeloid cells are kept in an immature state in the TME. These 
studies further show that tumor-derived factors mold these myeloid cells into 
cells that support cancer initiation and progression, amongst others by enabling 
immune evasion, tumor cell survival, proliferation, migration and metastasis. 
The key role of myeloid cells in cancer is further evidenced by the fact that 
they negatively impact on virtually all types of cancer therapy. Therefore, 
tumor-associated myeloid cells have been designated as the culprits in cancer. 
We review myeloid cells in the TME with a focus on the mechanisms they exploit 
to support cancer cells. In addition, we provide an overview of approaches that 
are under investigation to deplete myeloid cells or redirect their function, as 
these hold promise to overcome resistance to current cancer therapies.
