Abnormal activation of the γc cytokine JAK/STAT signaling pathway assessed by 
STAT3 or STAT5b phosphorylation was present in a proportion of many T-cell 
malignancies. Activating mutations of STAT3/STAT5b and JAK1/3 were present in 
some but not in all cases with constitutive signaling pathway activation. Using 
shRNA analysis pSTAT malignant T-cell lines were addicted to JAKs/STATs whether 
they were mutated or not. Activating JAK/STAT mutations were not sufficient to 
support leukemic cell proliferation but only augmented upstream pathway signals. 
Functional cytokine receptors were required for pSTAT expression. Combining a 
JAK1/2 inhibitor with a Bcl-xL inhibitor navitoclax provided 
additive/synergistic activity with IL-2 dependent ATLL cell lines and in a mouse 
model of human IL-2 dependent ATLL. The insight that disorders of the 
γc/JAK/STAT system are pervasive suggests approaches including those that target 
gamma cytokines, their receptors or that use JAK kinase inhibitors may be of 
value in multicomponent therapy for T-cell malignancies.
