Familial cancer syndromes present rare insights into malignant tumor 
development. The molecular background of polyp formation and the cancer prone 
state in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome remain enigmatic to this day. Previously, we 
proposed that Peutz-Jeghers polyps are not pre-malignant lesions, but an 
epiphenomenon to the malignant condition. However, Peutz-Jeghers polyp formation 
and the cancer-prone state must both be accounted for by the same molecular 
mechanism. Our contribution focuses on the histopathology of the characteristic 
Peutz-Jeghers polyp and recent research on stem cell dynamics and how these 
concepts relate to Peutz-Jeghers polyposis. We discuss a protracted clonal 
evolution scenario in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome due to a germline LKB1 mutation. 
Peutz-Jeghers polyp formation and malignant transformation are separately 
mediated through the same molecular mechanism played out on different 
timescales. Thus, a single mechanism accounts for the development of benign 
Peutz-Jeghers polyps and for malignant transformation in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
