OBJECTIVES: To explore the significance of an E-cadherin gene promoter 
polymorphism for risk and disease severity of prostate cancer in a Japanese 
population.
METHODS: We enrolled 200 patients with sporadic prostate cancer and 159 control 
patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia in this case-control study. The 
-160C/A polymorphism in the E-cadherin gene promoter was genotyped by polymerase 
chain reaction-restriction fragment length analysis.
RESULTS: The C/C, C/A, and A/A genotypes were observed in 58%, 39%, and 3% of 
patients, respectively, whereas the C/C, C/A, and A/A genotypes were observed in 
75%, 25%, and 0.63% of control subjects, respectively. Japanese men carrying the 
A allele and A/A genotype had 1.88-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25 to 
2.84) and 9.03-fold (95% CI, 1.50 to 172.36) higher risks, respectively, for 
prostate cancer than did carriers of the C allele and C/C genotype. There was no 
significant association between the polymorphism and clinical stage or 
pathologic grade.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the A allele of the -160C/A polymorphism in the 
E-cadherin gene may be a risk factor for prostate cancer in the Japanese 
population.
