BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of 
cancer-related deaths. The average survival and 5-year survival rates of HCC 
patients still remains poor. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand 
the mechanisms of cancer progression in HCC and to identify useful biomarkers to 
predict prognosis.
METHODS: Public data portals including Oncomine, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) profiles were used to retrieve the HCC-related 
microarrays and to identify potential genes contributed to cancer progression. 
Bioinformatics analyses including pathway enrichment, protein/gene interaction 
and text mining were used to explain the potential roles of the identified genes 
in HCC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and Western 
blotting were used to measure the expression of the targets. The data were 
analysed by SPSS 20.0 software.
RESULTS: We identified 80 genes that were significantly dysregulated in HCC 
according to four independent microarrays covering 386 cases of HCC and 327 
normal liver tissues. Twenty genes were consistently and stably dysregulated in 
the four microarrays by at least 2-fold and detection of gene expression by 
RT-qPCR and western blotting showed consistent expression profiles in 11 HCC 
tissues compared with corresponding paracancerous tissues. Eleven of these 20 
genes were associated with disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) 
in a cohort of 157 HCC patients, and eight genes were associated with tumour 
pathologic PT, tumour stage or vital status. Potential roles of those 20 genes 
in regulation of HCC progression were predicted, primarily in association with 
metastasis. INTS8 was specifically correlated with most clinical characteristics 
including DFS, OS, stage, metastasis, invasiveness, diagnosis, and age.
CONCLUSION: The significantly dysregulated genes identified in this study were 
associated with cancer progression and prognosis in HCC, and might be potential 
therapeutic targets for HCC treatment or potential biomarkers for diagnosis and 
prognosis.
