BACKGROUND: Mutations in the PB1 subunit of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 
of influenza A virus can affect replication fidelity. Before the influenza 
A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009, most human influenza A/H1N1 viruses contained the 
avian-associated residue, serine, at position 216 in PB1. However, near the 
onset of the 2009 pandemic, human viruses began to acquire the 
mammalian-associated residue, glycine, at PB1-216, and PB1-216G became 
predominant in human viruses thereafter.
METHODS: Using entropy-based analysis algorithm, we have previously identified 
several host-specific amino-acid signatures that separated avian and swine 
viruses from human influenza viruses. The presence of these host-specific 
signatures in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses suggested that these mutations were 
the result of adaptive genetic evolution that enabled these influenza viruses to 
circumvent host barriers, which resulted in cross-species transmission. We 
investigated the biological impact of this natural avian-to-mammalian signature 
substitution at PB1-216 in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses.
RESULTS: We found that PB1-216G viruses had greater mutation potential, and were 
more sensitive to ribavirin than PB1-216S viruses. In oseltamivir-treated HEK293 
cells, PB1-216G viruses generated mutations in viral neuraminidase at a higher 
rate than PB1-216S viruses. By contrast, PB1-216S viruses were more virulent in 
mice than PB1-216G viruses. These results suggest that the PB1-S216G 
substitution enhances viral epidemiological fitness by increasing the frequency 
of adaptive mutations in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results thus suggest that the increased adaptability and 
epidemiological fitness of naturally arising human PB1-216G viruses, which have 
a canonical low-fidelity replicase, were the biological mechanisms underlying 
the replacement of PB1-216S viruses with a high-fidelity replicase following the 
emergence of pdmH1N1. We think that continued surveillance of such naturally 
occurring PB1-216 variants among others is warranted to assess the potential 
impact of changes in RdRp fidelity on the adaptability and epidemiological 
fitness of human A/H1N1 influenza viruses.
