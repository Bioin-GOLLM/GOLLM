Here we asked if insulin activation of the nucleus accumbens in vitro is 
reflected by an increase in (3)H-deoxyglucose ([(3)H]DG) uptake, thus subserving 
a new model to study molecular mechanisms of central insulin actions. 
Additionally, we investigated the dependence of this insulin effect on 
endocannabinoids and corticosteroids, two major culprits in insulin resistance. 
We found that in acute accumbal slices, insulin (3 and 300nM but not at 0.3nM) 
produced an increase in [(3)H]DG uptake. The synthetic cannabinoid agonist, 
WIN55212-2 (500nM) and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (10μM), impaired insulin 
(300nM) action on [(3)H]DG uptake. The glucocorticoid receptor (GcR) antagonist, 
mifepristone (10μM) prevented dexamethasone from inhibiting insulin's action. 
Strikingly, this anti-insulin action of dexamethasone was also blocked by two 
CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) antagonists, O-2050 (500nM) and SR141716A 
(500nM), as well as by tetrahydrolipstatin (10μM), an inhibitor of 
diacylglycerol lipases-the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the 
endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG). On the other hand, the blockade 
of the post-synaptic 2-AG metabolizing enzymes, α,β-serine hydrolase domain 6/12 
by WWL70 (1μM) also prevented the action of insulin, probably via increasing 
endogenous 2-AG tone. Additionally, an anti-insulin receptor (InsR) antibody 
immunoprecipitated CB1Rs from accumbal homogenates, indicating a physical 
complexing of CB1Rs with InsRs that supports their functional interaction. 
Altogether, insulin stimulates glucose uptake in the nucleus accumbens. Accumbal 
GcR activation triggers the synthesis of 2-AG that in turn binds to the known 
CB1R-InsR heteromer, thus impeding insulin signaling.
