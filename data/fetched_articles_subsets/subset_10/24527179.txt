Because many cancers harbor mutations that confer resistance to apoptosis, there 
is a need for therapeutic agents that can trigger alternative forms of cell 
death. Methuosis is a novel form of non-apoptotic cell death characterized by 
accumulation of vacuoles derived from macropinosomes and endosomes. Previous 
studies identified an indole-based chalcone, 
3-(5-methoxy-2-methylindol-3-yl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (MOMIPP), that 
induces methuosis in human cancer cells. Herein, we describe the synthesis of 
related 2-indolyl substituted pyridinylpropenones and their effects on U251 
glioblastoma cells. Increasing the size of the 2-indolyl substituent 
substantially reduces growth inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity, but does not 
prevent cell vacuolization. Computational models suggest that the results are 
not due to steric-driven conformational effects. The unexpected uncoupling of 
vacuolization and cell death implies that the relationship between endosomal 
perturbations and methuotic cell death is more complex than previously realized. 
The new series of compounds will be useful in further defining the molecular and 
cellular mechanisms underlying methuosis.
