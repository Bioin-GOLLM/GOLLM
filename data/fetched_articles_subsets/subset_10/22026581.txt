CONTEXT: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare autosomal dominant 
disorder mostly owing to a genetic defect in MEN1 gene. Not all patients with 
MEN1 phenotype present a defect in this gene. Thus, other genes like CDKN and 
AIP have been showed to be involved in MEN1-like patients.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform a genetic screening in our 
cohort or patients with suspected MEN1 syndrome by direct sequencing analysis of 
MEN1, CDKN1B and AIP, and dosage analysis of MEN1 and AIP.
RESULTS: A total of 79 different sporadic and familial cases with the MEN1 
phenotype have been studied, in which 34 of them (48%) present a mutation in 
MEN1 gene. In two patients without a detectable mutation in MEN1 gene, we have 
identified a novel missense mutation (c.163G>A/p.Ala55Thr) in CDKN1B gene and a 
novel frameshift mutation (c.825_845delCGCGGCCGTGTGGAATGCCCA/p. His275GlnfsX49) 
in AIP gene, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that MEN1 gene is the main target for genetic 
analysis in clinical MEN1 syndrome. We confirm that in those patients without 
MEN1 gene mutation, other genes such as CDKN1B/p27Kip, or AIP in those including 
pituitary tumours should also be tested.
