Interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) plays a key role in the production 
of IFN-α in response to viral infection, and phosphorylation at IRF7 C-terminal 
serine sites is prelude to its function. However, phosphatases that negatively 
regulate IRF7 phosphorylation and activity have not been reported. In this 
study, we have identified a conserved protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-binding motif 
in human and mouse IRF7 proteins, and shown that PP1 physically interacts with 
IRF7. Exogenous expression of PP1 subunits (PP1α, β, or γ) ablates 
IKKε-stimulated IRF7 phosphorylation and dramatically attenuates IRF7 
transcriptional activity. Inhibition of PP1 activity significantly increases 
IRF7 phosphorylation and IRF7-mediated IFN-α production in response to Newcastle 
disease virus (NDV) infection or Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) challenge, leading 
to impaired viral replication. In addition, IFN treatment, TLR challenges and 
viral infection induce PP1 expression. Our findings disclose for the first time 
a pivotal role for PP1 in impeding IRF7-mediated IFN-α production in host immune 
responses.
