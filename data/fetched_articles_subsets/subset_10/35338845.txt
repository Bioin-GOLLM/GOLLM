mTORC1 controls cellular metabolic processes in response to nutrient 
availability. Amino acid signals are transmitted to mTORC1 through the Rag 
GTPases, which are localized on the lysosomal surface by the Ragulator complex. 
The Rag GTPases receive amino acid signals from multiple upstream regulators. 
One negative regulator, GATOR1, is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for RagA. 
GATOR1 binds to the Rag GTPases via two modes: an inhibitory mode and a GAP 
mode. How these two binding interactions coordinate to process amino acid 
signals is unknown. Here, we resolved three cryo-EM structural models of the 
GATOR1-Rag-Ragulator complex, with the Rag-Ragulator subcomplex occupying the 
inhibitory site, the GAP site, and both binding sites simultaneously. When the 
Rag GTPases bind to GATOR1 at the GAP site, both Rag subunits contact GATOR1 to 
coordinate their nucleotide loading states. These results reveal a potential GAP 
mechanism of GATOR1 during the mTORC1 inactivation process.
