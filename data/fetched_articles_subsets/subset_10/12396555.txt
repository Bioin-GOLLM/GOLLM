In the present study, we determined whether genetic variability in the gene 
encoding tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) contributes to individual 
differences in susceptibility to the development of polycystic ovary syndrome 
(PCOS). The study involved 87 Caucasian Finnish women with PCOS and 115 healthy 
control women who were genotyped for the C-850T polymorphism in the TNF-alpha 
gene promoter. Analysis by chi(2) was used to assess genotype and allele 
frequency differences between PCOS women and controls. A similar genotype 
distribution for the C-850T polymorphism was observed in the two groups, with 
the frequency of the variant T allele being 8.6% in the PCOS group and 9.6% in 
the control group (p = 0.862). Accordingly, the profile of genotype frequencies 
was similar in the groups. The observed profiles of allele and genotype 
frequencies confirm an equilibrium state between C-850T polymorphism and PCOS 
and suggest that polymorphism of the TNF-alpha gene is unlikely to contribute to 
the risk of PCOS.
