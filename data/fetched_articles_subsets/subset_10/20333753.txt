Zinc is essential for normal brain development. Gestational severe zinc 
deficiency can lead to overt fetal brain malformations. Although not 
teratogenic, suboptimal zinc nutrition during gestation can have long-term 
effects on the offspring's nervous system. This article will review current 
knowledge on the role of zinc in modulating neurogenesis and neuronal apoptosis 
as well as the proposed underlying mechanisms. A decrease in neuronal zinc 
causes cell cycle arrest, which in part involves a deregulation of select 
signals (ERK1/2, p53, and NF-kappaB). Zinc deficiency also induces apoptotic 
neuronal death through the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway, which can be 
triggered by the activation of the zinc-regulated enzyme caspase-3, and as a 
consequence of abnormal regulation of prosurvival signals (ERK1/2 and 
NF-kappaB). Alterations in the finely tuned processes of neurogenesis, neuronal 
migration, differentiation, and apoptosis, which involve the developmental 
shaping of the nervous system, could have a long-term impact on brain health. 
Zinc deficiency during gestation, even at the marginal levels observed in human 
populations, could increase the risk for behavioral/neurological disorders in 
infancy, adolescence, and adulthood.
