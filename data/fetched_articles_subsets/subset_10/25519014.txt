BACKGROUND: The pro-inflammatory cytokines play an essential role in immune 
response and are involved in a variety of inflammatory and infectious disease. 
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) gene polymorphism has been a potential 
determinant of susceptibility to various types of cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of TNF-α gene promoter (-238) G/A and 
(-308) G/A polymorphisms with the susceptibility of OSCC patients in North 
Indian population.
METHODS: A total 272 patients with OSCC and 185 healthy volunteers were 
genotypes for the TNF-α (-238) G/A and (-308) G/A gene polymorphism. Genotypes 
were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP). Genotype frequencies were evaluated by Chi-square test and 
Odds ratio (OR) relative risk.
RESULTS: TNF-α (-238) G/A polymorphism was significantly associated with OSCC 
patients as compared to healthy volunteers (GG vs. GA: OR=0.3500, 95% 
CI=0.1289-09502; p=0.036; G vs. A: OR=0.3589 1.477, 95% CI=0.1335-0.9652; 
p=0.0386). No significant association was found in TNF-α (-308) G/A gene 
polymorphism with OSCC patients and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the TNF-α (-238) G/A polymorphism was 
significantly associated with OSCC however TNF-α (-308) G/A polymorphism was not 
associated in OSCC patients.
