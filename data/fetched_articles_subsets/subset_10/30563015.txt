Two new sceptrin derivatives (1,2) and eight structurally-related known 
bromopyrrole-bearing alkaloids were isolated from the tropical sponge Agelas 
kosrae. By a combination of spectroscopic methods, the new compounds, designated 
dioxysceptrin (1) and ageleste C (2), were determined to be structural analogs 
of each other that differ at the imidazole moiety. Dioxysceptrin was also found 
to exist as a mixture of Î±-amido epimers. The sceptrin alkaloids exhibited weak 
cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Compounds 1 and 2 also moderately exhibited 
anti-angiogenic and isocitrate lyase-inhibitory activities, respectively.
