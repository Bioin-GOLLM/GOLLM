It has been proposed that extracellular cGMP modulates the ability to learn a Y 
maze task, but the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. Here we show that 
extracellular cGMP, at physiological concentrations, modulates learning in the Y 
maze in a biphasic way by modulating the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in 
cerebellum. Extracellular cGMP reduces glycine receptors activation inducing a 
voltage-dependent calcium-channels-mediated increase of calcium in Purkinje 
neurons. This calcium increase modulates CaMKII phosphorylation in a biphasic 
way. When basal calcium concentration is low extracellular cGMP reduces CaMKII 
phosphorylation, increasing nitric oxide synthase activity, the 
glutamate-NO-cGMP pathway function and learning ability. When basal calcium is 
normal extracellular cGMP increases CaMKII phosphorylation, reducing nitric 
oxide synthase activity, the pathway function and learning. These data unveil 
new mechanisms modulating learning in the Y maze and likely other learning types 
which may be therapeutic targets to improve learning in pathological situations 
associated with altered cGMP levels.
