Mutations in Methyl-CpG-Binding protein 2 (MECP2) are commonly associated with 
the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT). However, some people with 
RTT do not have mutations in MECP2, and interestingly there have been people 
identified with MECP2 mutations that do not have the clinical features of RTT. 
In this report we present four people with neurodevelopmental abnormalities and 
clear RTT-disease causing MECP2 mutation but lacking the characteristic clinical 
features of RTT. One patient's symptoms suggest an extension of the known 
spectrum of MECP2 associated phenotypes to include global developmental delay 
with obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
These results reemphasize that RTT should remain a clinical diagnosis, based on 
the recent consensus criteria.
