Three sibs were eventually diagnosed as having diastrophic dysplasia. The 
firstborn, a male, lacked many of the clinical manifestations and radiological 
abnormalities of the hands, such that the diagnosis of diastrophic dysplasia 
could not be made. Subsequently, his twin sisters were born with more severe 
skeletal involvement, but not many additional clinical findings, until one of 
his sisters (patient 2) developed a left ear cyst at age 2 months. Some cases of 
diastrophic dysplasia may be mild enough not to allow for a secure diagnosis, 
particularly in a neonate or infant occurring as the first affected person in 
the family.
