High-grade gliomas with arginine or valine substitutions of the histone H3.3 
glycine-34 residue (H3.3G34R/V) carry a dismal prognosis, and current 
treatments, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, are not curative. Because 
H3.3G34R/V mutations reprogram epigenetic modifications, we undertook a 
comprehensive epigenetic approach using ChIP sequencing and ChromHMM 
computational analysis to define therapeutic dependencies in H3.3G34R/V gliomas. 
Our analyses revealed a convergence of epigenetic alterations, including (i) 
activating epigenetic modifications on histone H3 lysine (K) residues such as 
H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), and H3K4 
trimethylation (H3K4me3); (ii) DNA promoter hypomethylation; and (iii) 
redistribution of repressive histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) to 
intergenic regions at the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) locus to drive 
increased LIF abundance and secretion by H3.3G34R/V cells. LIF activated signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in an 
autocrine/paracrine manner to promote survival of H3.3G34R/V glioma cells. 
Moreover, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA sequencing from H3.3G34R/V 
patient tumors revealed high STAT3 protein and RNA expression, respectively, in 
tumor cells with both inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. We targeted STAT3 
using a blood-brain barrierâ€“penetrable small-molecule inhibitor, WP1066, 
currently in clinical trials for adult gliomas. WP1066 treatment resulted in 
H3.3G34R/V tumor cell toxicity in vitro and tumor suppression in preclinical 
mouse models established with KNS42 cells, SJ-HGGx42-c cells, or in utero 
electroporation techniques. Our studies identify the LIF/STAT3 pathway as a key 
epigenetically driven and druggable vulnerability in H3.3G34R/V gliomas. This 
finding could inform development of targeted, combination therapies for these 
lethal brain tumors.
