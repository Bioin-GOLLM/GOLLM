Plants belonging to the genus Veratrum have been used throughout history for 
their medicinal properties. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, 
phytochemical investigations revealed a host of steroidal alkaloids in Veratrum 
species, some of which are potent bioactives. This review discusses Veratrum 
species that grow in North America with a focus on the medicinal history of 
these plants and the steroidal alkaloids they contain. While significant reviews 
have been devoted to singularly describing the plant species within the genus 
Veratrum (botany), the staggering breadth of alkaloids isolated from these and 
related plants (phytochemistry), and the intricacies of how the various 
alkaloids act on their biological targets (physiology and biochemistry), this 
review will straddle the margins of the aforementioned disciplines in an attempt 
to provide a unified, coherent picture of the Veratrum plants of North America 
and the medicinal uses of their bioactive steroidal alkaloids.
