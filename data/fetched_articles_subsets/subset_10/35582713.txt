An estimated 30,000 men in the United States will die of metastatic prostate 
cancer (PCa) each year due to the development of therapy resistance, most 
notably resistance to second-generation antiandrogen enzalutamide. The vast 
majority of PCa is driven by the androgen receptor (AR). Enzalutamide is an AR 
antagonist, which extends patient survival and is widely used in the clinic for 
the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC); however, many 
patients will have primary or develop acquired resistance and continue to 
progress. Characterization of the molecular mechanisms of enzalutamide 
resistance provides insight into potentially efficacious therapies for 
enzalutamide-resistant CRPC (ER-CRPC). Understanding these mechanisms is 
critical for the identification of biomarkers predictive of therapy resistance 
and the development of therapeutic strategies to target ER-CRPC.
