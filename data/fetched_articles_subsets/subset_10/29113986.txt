Purpose: MuscadinePlus (MPX), a commercial preparation of pulverized muscadine 
grape skin, was evaluated as a therapeutic option for men with biochemically 
recurrent (BCR) prostate cancer wishing to defer androgen deprivation 
therapy.Experimental Design: This was a 12-month, multicenter, 
placebo-controlled, two-dose, double-blinded trial of MPX in 125 men with BCR 
prostate cancer, powered to detect a PSA doubling time (PSADT) difference of 6 
months (low dose) and 12 months (high dose) relative to placebo. Participants 
were stratified (baseline PSADT, Gleason score) and randomly assigned 1:2:2 to 
receive placebo, 500 mg MPX (low), or 4,000 mg MPX (high) daily. Correlates 
included superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) genotype, lipid peroxidation, and 
polyphenol pharmacokinetics.Results: The evaluable population included 112 
patients, all treated for at least 6 months and 62% treated for 12 months. No 
significant difference was found in PSADT change between control and treatment 
arms (P = 0.81): control 0.9 months (n = 20; range, 6.7-83.1), low dose 1.5 
months (n = 52; range, 10.3-87.2), high dose 0.9 months (n = 40; range, 
27.3-88.1). One high-dose patient experienced objective response. No 
drug-related CTCAE grade 3-4 adverse events were seen. In a preplanned 
exploratory analysis, PSADT pre-to-post increase was significant in the 27 (26%) 
genotyped patients with SOD2 Alanine/Alanine genotype (rs4880 T>C polymorphism) 
on MPX (pooled treatment arms; 6.4 months, P = 0.02), but not in control (1.8 
months, P = 0.25).Conclusions: Compared with placebo, MPX did not significantly 
prolong PSADT in BCR patients over two different doses. Exploratory analysis 
revealed a patient population with potential benefit that would require further 
study. Clin Cancer Res; 24(2); 306-15. ©2017 AACR.
