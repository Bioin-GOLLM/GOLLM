We report in this paper the use of free-radical thiol-ene coupling (TEC) for the 
introduction of carbohydrate, poly(ethylene glycol), and peptide fragments at 
the periphery of an alkene functional dendrimer. Four different sugar thiols 
including glucose, mannose, lactose and sialic acid, two PEGylated thiols and 
the natural tripeptide glutathione were reacted with a fourth generation alkene 
functional dendrimer [G4]-ene(48) upon irradiation at λ(max) 365 nm. In all 
cases, the (1)H NMR spectra of the crude reaction mixture revealed the complete 
disappearance of alkene proton signals indicating the quantitative conversion of 
all 48 alkene groups of the dendrimer. With one exception only, all dendrimer 
conjugates were isolated in high yields (70-94%), validating the high efficiency 
of multiple TEC reactions on a single substrate. All isolated and purified 
compounds were analyzed by MALDI-TOF spectrometry and gave spectra consistent 
with the assigned structure.
