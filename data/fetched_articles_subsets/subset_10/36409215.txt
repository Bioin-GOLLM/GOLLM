PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism 
underlying thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) clinical subtypes, to do so, 
we performed transcriptomic analysis to reveal the expression profile of 
circular RNAs (circRNAs) in TAO subtypes.
METHODS: High-throughput RNA-sequencing was performed in six pairs of type I and 
type II orbital connective tissue samples from patients with TAO. The expression 
levels of circRNAs and mRNAs in type I and type II samples were measured by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in another three 
pairs of type I and type II TAO connective tissue samples. We used 
bioinformatics predictions to construct a circRNA-microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA network. 
A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on 
differential mRNA expression, and the hub genes were determined by the Cytoscape 
software plugin. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to 
elucidate circRNA function. Lentiviral-mediated overexpression of 
hsa_circ_0007006 and the relationship between hsa_circ_0007006 with COL1A1 and 
MMP2 were evaluated by Western blotting (WB). Moreover, the differential 
pathways were assessed by WB.
RESULTS: RNA sequencing results predicted a total of 7489 circRNAs and 15,803 
mRNAs, with 94 upregulated and 76 downregulated circRNAs and 488 upregulated and 
138 downregulated mRNAs. The qRT-PCR analysis of seven dysregulated circRNAs and 
two major mRNAs validated the RNA-sequencing data. The competing endogenous RNA 
(ceRNA) network included 7 circRNAs, 23 miRNAs, and 262 mRNAs. Functional 
analysis revealed several important pathways. Overexpression of hsa_circ_0007006 
led to decreased expression levels of COL1A1 and MMP2. Activation of the relaxin 
signaling pathway differed between the two subtypes.
CONCLUSION: We showed that circRNAs are differentially expressed between type I 
and type II TAO. We speculate that the hsa_circ_0007006-COL1A1 and MMP2-relaxin 
signaling pathways are important regulatory axes in the pathogenesis of this 
disease type and could be considered promising diagnostic and therapeutic 
targets in the future.
