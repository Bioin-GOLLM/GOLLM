Thrombin activates human platelets via 2 protease-activated receptors (PARs), 
PAR1 and PAR4, both of which are antithrombotic drug targets: a PAR1 inhibitor 
is approved for clinical use, and a PAR4 inhibitor is in trial. However, a 
common sequence variant in human PAR4 (rs773902, encoding Thr120 in place of 
Ala120) renders the receptor more sensitive to agonists and less sensitive to 
antagonists. Here, we develop the first human monoclonal function-blocking 
antibody to human PAR4 and show it provides equivalent efficacy against the 
Ala120 and Thr120 PAR4 variants. This candidate was generated from a panel of 
anti-PAR4 antibodies, was found to bind PAR4 with affinity (KD ≈ 0.4 nM) and 
selectivity (no detectable binding to any of PAR1, PAR2, or PAR3), and is 
capable of near-complete inhibition of thrombin cleavage of either the Ala120 or 
Thr120 PAR4 variant. Platelets from individuals expressing the Thr120 PAR4 
variant exhibit increased thrombin-induced aggregation and phosphatidylserine 
exposure vs those with the Ala120 PAR4 variant, yet the PAR4 antibody inhibited 
these responses equivalently (50% inhibitory concentration, 4.3 vs 3.2 µg/mL 
against Ala120 and Thr120, respectively). Further, the antibody significantly 
impairs platelet procoagulant activity in an ex vivo thrombosis assay, with 
equivalent inhibition of fibrin formation and overall thrombus size in blood 
from individuals expressing the Ala120 or Thr120 PAR4 variant. These findings 
reveal antibody-mediated inhibition of PAR4 cleavage and activation provides 
robust antithrombotic activity independent of the rs773902 PAR4 sequence variant 
and provides rationale for such an approach for antithrombotic therapy targeting 
this receptor.
