BACKGROUND: In HCV-infected people who fail to achieve sustained virological 
response after receiving a direct-acting antiviral regimen, virological failure 
is almost always accompanied by the presence of resistance-associated 
substitutions (RASs) in the target protein(s). The aim of this long-term 
observational study was to evaluate the persistence of NS3/4A and NS5A RASs in 
participants with genotype (GT) 1 infection who relapsed following treatment 
with a grazoprevir-containing treatment regimen.
METHODS: RASs were evaluated at baseline (that is, pre-dose on day 1 of the 
original treatment), at the time of virological failure, and up to follow-up 
week 96. A total of 58 participants were included.
RESULTS: In participants treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir Â± ribavirin, observed 
baseline NS3 RASs included 56F, 80K/L, 122N and 170V/I, and observed 
treatment-emergent NS3 RASs included 36M, 56F/H, 122G, 132I, 156G/I/L/P/T, 
168A/E/G/V/Y and 170T. Observed baseline NS5A RASs included 28M/T/V, 30H/R, 
31M/V and 93H/N, and treatment-emergent NS5A RASs included 28A/G/S/T, 30H/R, 
31M/V and 93H/N/S. Baseline NS3 and NS5A RASs present at time of failure tended 
to persist during follow-up, and most were detectable for more than 2 years 
following virological failure. Treatment-emergent NS5A RASs present at time of 
failure also tended to persist for more than 2 years following virological 
failure (93%). By contrast, >80% of treatment-emergent NS3 RASs detected at 
failure had been supplanted by wild type by week 36.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-emergent NS5A RASs can persist for extended periods of 
time. Retreatment strategies should take account of the presence of these RASs.
