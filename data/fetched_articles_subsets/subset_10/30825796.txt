Ionotropic glutamate receptors in vertebrates are composed of three major 
subtypes - AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors - and mediate the majority of fast 
excitatory neurotransmission at chemical synapses of the central nervous system. 
Among the three major families, native AMPA receptors function as complexes with 
a variety of auxiliary subunits, which in turn modulate receptor trafficking, 
gating, pharmacology, and permeation. Despite the long history of 
structure-mechanism studies using soluble receptor domains or intact yet 
isolated receptors, structures of AMPA receptor-auxiliary subunit complexes have 
not been available until recent breakthroughs in single-particle cryo-electron 
microscopy. Single particle cryo-EM studies have, in turn, provided new insights 
into the structure and organization of AMPA receptor - auxiliary protein 
complexes and into the molecular mechanisms of AMPA receptor activation and 
desensitization.
