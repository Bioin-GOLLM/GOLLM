Autophagy plays an important role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We 
aimed to establish novel autophagy-related tumor subtypes to distinguish the 
prognosis of NSCLC. In this study, gene expression profiles, mutation data and 
clinical information obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Kaplan Meier-plotter 
could evaluate prognostic value of autophagy-related genes. Consensus clustering 
revealed autophagy-related tumor subtypes. Gene expression profiles, mutation 
data and immune infiltration signatures were identified, oncogenic pathways and 
gene-drug interactions were performed according to the clusters. Finally, a 
total of 23 prognostic genes were screened and consensus clustering analysis 
divided the NSCLC into 2 clusters. The mutation signature showed that 6 genes 
are special. Immune infiltration signatures showed that higher fraction of 
immune cells was associated with cluster 1. The oncogenic pathways and gene-drug 
interactions also showed different patterns. In conclusion, autophagy-related 
tumor subtypes have different prognosis. Understanding the subtypes of NSCLC are 
helpful to accurately identify the NSCLC and personalized treatment.
