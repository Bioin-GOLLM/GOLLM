We previously reported that microRNA (miR)-29b is down-regulated and has a tumor 
suppressor role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, little is known about 
the mechanisms responsible for miR-29b expression downregulation in AML. In this 
work we screened for mutations that could affect miR-29b expression. Using 
Sanger sequencing, we identified a germline thymidine (T) base deletion within 
the miR-29b-1/miR-29a cluster precursor in 16% of AML patients. Remarkably we 
found a significant enrichment for the presence of the miR-29 polymorphism in 
core binding factor (CBF) newly diagnosed AML patients (n = 61/303; 20%) with 
respect to age, sex and race matched controls (n = 43/402:11%, P < 0.01). 
Mechanistically, this polymorphism affects the expression ratio of mature 
miR-29b and miR-29a by dampening the processing of miR-29a. RNA 
immunoprecipitation assays showed reduced DROSHA binding capacity to the 
polymorphism with respect to the controls. Finally, we showed that this 
polymorphism negatively impacts the ability of miR-29b-1/miR-29a cluster to 
target MCL-1 and CDK6, both known miR-29 targets.
