Cell-penetrating-peptides (CPPs) are small amino-acid sequences characterized by 
their ability to cross cellular membranes. They can transport various bioactive 
cargos inside cells including nucleic acids, large proteins, and other chemical 
compounds. Since 1988, natural and synthetic CPPs have been developed for 
applications ranging from fundamental to applied biology (cell imaging, gene 
editing, therapeutics delivery). In recent years, a great number of studies 
reported the potential of CPPs as carriers for the treatment of various 
diseases. Apart from a good efficacy due to a rapid and potent delivery, a 
crucial advantage of CPP-based therapies is the peptides low toxicity compared 
to most drug carriers. On the other hand, they are quite unstable and lack 
specificity. Higher specificity can be obtained using a cell-specific CPP to 
transport the therapeutic agent or using a non-specific CPP to transport a cargo 
with a targeted activity. CPP-cargo complexes can also be conjugated to another 
moiety that brings cell- or tissue-specificity. Studies based on all these 
approaches are showing promising results. Here, we focus on recent advances in 
the potential usage of CPPs in the context of cancer therapy, with a particular 
interest in CPP-mediated delivery of anti-tumoral proteins.
