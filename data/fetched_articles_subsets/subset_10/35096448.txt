BACKGROUND: This experimental study aims to investigate the pleurodesis effects 
of iodopovidone at different concentrations (2% and 4%) and sterile talc in a 
rat model.
METHODS: Forty male Wistar Albino rats were randomly divided into four equal 
groups including 10 rats in each group. Groups 1, 2, and 3 were designed as the 
study, and Group 4 as the control group. In Group 1, 4 g sterile talc was given 
in the slurry form at 20 mL 0.9% saline solution, in Group 2 and Group 3 10% 
iodopovidone solution were given at 4% and 2% concentrations, respectively, and 
in Group 4, 0.9% saline was only administrated as 3 mL into the pleural space. 
All rats were sacrificed on Day 30 and evaluated for macroscopic and microscopic 
examination. Microscopic evaluation was performed for alveolar collapse, 
alveolar hemorrhage, alveolar infiltration and fibrosis. Brain, liver, and 
kidney tissues were also examined.
RESULTS: Iodopovidone macroscopically caused a significant adhesion similar to 
sterile talc at a concentration of 4%. The pleurodesis effect of iodopovidone at 
a concentration of 4% was significantly similar to talc, when microscopic 
parameters were evaluated. Granulomas due to sterile talc were observed in the 
opposite hemithorax. Brain, liver, and kidney examinations revealed no systemic 
distribution for both agents.
CONCLUSION: Iodopovidone is a powerful alternative to sterile talc with its easy 
accessibility and low cost. In this study, 4% iodopovidone was found to provide 
effective and safe pleurodesis in rats. We believe that the use of this 
concentration in clinical studies would provide more effective results.
