Persistent Post-Mastectomy Pain (PPMP) is a common condition that can follow 
surgeries for breast cancer, the most common cancer in women. Because of the 
frequency of PPMP and its potential severity, it has received increasing 
research attention. This manuscript reviews the recent research literature, 
beginning with a brief history and then relevant medical, surgical, demographic, 
and psychosocial risk factors. Subsequently, social, psychological, and 
functional sequelae that have been linked to PPMPS are considered, as is 
research on current pharmacological, psychological, and rehabilitative 
approaches to treatment. The review concludes with a discussion of directions 
for future research and treatment that might reduce the incidence and impact of 
PPMP on breast cancer survivors. PERSPECTIVE: This article describes current 
research literature involving mechanisms, risks, and treatments related to 
persistent post-mastectomy pain. Implications of research findings also are 
discussed for pre- and post-surgical approaches to pain management, current 
treatments, and promising research directions.
