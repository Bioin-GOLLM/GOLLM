CanAssist Breast (CAB) has thus far been validated on a retrospective cohort of 
1123 patients who are mostly Indians. Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of 
more than 95% was observed with significant separation (P < 0.0001) between 
low-risk and high-risk groups. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of 
CAB in guiding physicians to assess risk of cancer recurrence and to make 
informed treatment decisions for patients. Of more than 500 patients who have 
undergone CAB test, detailed analysis of 455 patients who were treated based on 
CAB-based risk predictions by more than 140 doctors across India is presented 
here. Majority of patients tested had node negative, T2, and grade 2 disease. 
Age and luminal subtypes did not affect the performance of CAB. On comparison 
with Adjuvant! Online (AOL), CAB categorized twice the number of patients into 
low risk indicating potential of overtreatment by AOL-based risk categorization. 
We assessed the impact of CAB testing on treatment decisions for 254 patients 
and observed that 92% low-risk patients were not given chemotherapy. Overall, we 
observed that 88% patients were either given or not given chemotherapy based on 
whether they were stratified as high risk or low risk for distant recurrence 
respectively. Based on these results, we conclude that CAB has been accepted by 
physicians to make treatment planning and provides a cost-effective alternative 
to other similar multigene prognostic tests currently available.
