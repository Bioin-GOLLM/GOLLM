We aimed to investigate whether interleukin-10 (IL-10) -1082 G/G genotype is 
associated with lower mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 
a Chinese population. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in 314 
cases of ARDS and 210 controls who were admitted to an intensive care unit with 
sepsis, trauma, aspiration or massive transfusions. Cases were followed for 
30-day mortality. The -1082G/G genotype was associated with lower development of 
ARDS (OR=0.51; 95% CI 0.34-0.76; P=0.001). Among patients with ARDS, the 
-1082G/G genotype was associated with lower 30-day mortality (OR=0.44; 95% CI 
0.25-0.76; P=0.003). In conclusion, IL-10-1082 G/G genotype is associated with 
lower development and mortality of ARDS in a Chinese population.
