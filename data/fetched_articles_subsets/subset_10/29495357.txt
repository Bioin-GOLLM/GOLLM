Genomic and proteomic studies have helped improve our understanding of the 
underlying mechanism(s) of cancer development and progression. Mutations, 
overexpressed oncogenes, inactivated/downregulated tumor suppressors, loss of 
apoptosis, and dysregulated signal transduction cascades are some of the 
well-studied areas of research. Resveratrol has gained considerable attention in 
the last two decades because of its pleiotropic anticancer activities. In this 
review, we have summarized the regulation of WNT, SHH (sonic hedgehog)/GLI 
(glioma-associated oncogene homolog), TGFÎ²1 (transforming growth factor beta 
1)/SMAD, NOTCH, TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), 
STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription), and microRNAs by 
resveratrol in different cancers. The importance of these signaling pathways in 
cancer progression, along with their modulation by resveratrol, is discussed. 
Further, we also evaluate the mechanisms and implications of the downregulation 
of oncogenic miRNAs and the upregulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs by 
resveratrol, both of which also define its ability to inhibit tumor growth and 
metastasis. It is envisioned that designing effective clinical trials will be 
helpful for the identification of resveratrol responders and non-responders and 
the elucidation of how this phytochemical can be combined with current 
therapeutic options to improve their clinical efficacy and reduce off-target 
effects.
