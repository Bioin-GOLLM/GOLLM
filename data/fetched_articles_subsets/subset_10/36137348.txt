BACKGROUND: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) (hereafter described as CLN 
disease) comprise a rare and life-limiting set of genetically inherited 
neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by abnormal lysosomal 
storage. The NCL disorders are, collectively, the most common group of 
degenerative brain disorders in children.
PATIENT DESCRIPTIONS: We report two cases of CLN disease that were diagnosed and 
treated at the Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, 
Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Both cases of CLN disease (CLN1 and CLN6 
diagnosed in 2016 and 2017, respectively) profiled in this report presented with 
clinical features of Rett syndrome. In the first case, a 2-year-old girl 
presented with Rett-like clinical features, including global developmental 
regression and hand-wringing action. Single-gene analysis of the MECP2 gene was 
negative. However, PPT1 gene sequencing revealed a novel homozygous frameshift 
mutation, c.629_630dupGT (p.Ile211Valfs∗10). In the second case, a 7.5-year-old 
girl presented with ataxia, progressive myoclonic epilepsy, and Rett-like 
hand-wringing. A c.794_796delCCT variant in the CLN6 gene was identified by 
whole-exome sequencing. Fingerprint bodies from electron microscopy of the skin 
also supported a diagnosis of CLN disease in our second case.
DISCUSSION: Presentation with clinical features of Rett syndrome has only been 
reported in patients diagnosed with CLN1 and CLN7 disease, and never in those 
with CLN6.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should suspect and investigate for CLN disease in 
patients with Rett-like phenotype who are negative for MECP2 mutation, 
especially in patients with visual impairment and early prominent brain atrophy.
