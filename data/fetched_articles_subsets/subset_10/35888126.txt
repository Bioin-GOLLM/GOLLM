BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of 
progressive and irreversible blindness in developed countries. Although the 
pathogenesis is not fully understood, AMD is a multifactorial pathology with an 
accumulation of inflammatory components and macrophages and a strong genetic 
predisposition. Our purpose was to investigate the association between early AMD 
and CCL2 (rs1024611, rs4586, rs2857656) and CCR2 (rs1799865) single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) and CCL2, CCR2 serum levels in a Lithuanian population.
METHODS: The study included 310 patients with early AMD and 384 healthy 
subjects. Genotyping of CCL2 rs1024611, rs4586, rs2857656, and CCR2 rs1799865 
was performed using a real-time polymerase chain reaction method, while CCL2 and 
CCR2 chemokines serum concentrations were analyzed using an enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: We found that the G allele at CCL2 rs1024611 was more prevalent in the 
early AMD group than in controls (29.2% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.032). Similarly, the C 
allele in CCL2 rs2857656 is more common in the early AMD group than in controls 
(29.2% vs. 24.2%, p = 0.037). Binomial logistic regression revealed that each G 
allele in rs1024611 was associated with 1.3-fold increased odds of developing 
early AMD under the additive model (OR = 1.322; 95% CI: 1.032-1.697, p = 0.027) 
as was each C allele in rs2857656 under the additive model (OR = 1.314; 95% CI: 
1.025-1.684, p = 0.031). Haplotype analysis revealed that the C-A-G haplotype of 
CCL2 SNPs was associated with 35% decreased odds of early AMD development. 
Further analysis showed elevated CCL2 serum levels in the group with early AMD 
compared to controls (median (IQR): 1181.6 (522.6) pg/mL vs. 879.9 (494.4) 
pg/mL, p = 0.013); however, there were no differences between CCR2 serum levels 
within groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We found the associations between minor alleles at CCL2 rs1024611 
and rs2857656, elevated CCL2 serum levels, and early AMD development.
