COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 globally impacted the humanity causing 
tragic outcomes; costing millions of lives, destroying economies and demolishing 
public health infrastructures. The emergence of vaccines using various ingenious 
approaches in less than a year was deemed the light at the end of the tunnel. 
However, recent emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 in several parts of the 
world revealed that another hurdle is ahead in the fight against COVID-19. This 
review will highlight how SARS-CoV-2 mutations, creating different virus 
variants could potentially impact virus pathogenesis as well as different 
therapy approaches and vaccine design.
