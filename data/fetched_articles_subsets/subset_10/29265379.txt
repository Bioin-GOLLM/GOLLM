BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the endogenous opioid system has been 
identified as 1 potential source of individual variability in naltrexone 
treatment outcomes. The majority of naltrexone pharmacogenetic studies have 
focused on a particular single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the mu-opioid 
receptor gene (OPRM1; rs1799971; commonly known as the Asn40Asp SNP) in 
Caucasian samples with decidedly mixed results. The goal of this study was to 
test the pharmacogenetic effects of naltrexone on subjective response to alcohol 
and self-administration of alcohol in individuals of East Asian descent. We 
hypothesized that naltrexone, compared with placebo, would potentiate the 
aversive and sedative effects of alcohol and reduce alcohol self-administration 
to a greater extent in Asp40 carriers.
METHODS: Participants (N = 77; Asn40Asn, n = 29; Asn40Asp, n = 34, and Asp40Asp, 
n = 14) completed 2 double-blinded and counterbalanced experimental sessions: 
one after taking naltrexone (50 mg/d) for 5 days and one after taking matched 
placebo for 5 days. In each experimental session, participants received a 
priming dose of intravenous alcohol up to the breath alcohol concentration 
target of 0.06 g/dl which was immediately followed by an alcohol 
self-administration period (1 hour).
RESULTS: There were no pharmacogenetic effects observed for alcohol-induced 
stimulation, sedation, craving for alcohol, or alcohol self-administration in 
the laboratory. During the self-administration period, Asp40 carriers consumed 
fewer drinks and had a longer latency to first drink as compared to Asn40 
homozygotes.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings in East Asians add to the mixed literature on 
naltrexone pharmacogenetics from predominantly Caucasian samples and highlight 
the complexity of these effects and their overall limited replicability. It is 
plausible that a consistent pharmacogenetic effect in tightly controlled 
preclinical and experimental medicine models "fades" in more complex and 
heterogeneous settings and samples.
