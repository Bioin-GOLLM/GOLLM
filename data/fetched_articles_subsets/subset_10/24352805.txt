Glucocorticoids (GCs) are steroid hormones that have inflammatory and 
immunosuppressive effects on a wide variety of cells. They are used as therapy 
for inflammatory disease and as a common agent against edema. The blood brain 
barrier (BBB), comprising microvascular endothelial cells, serves as a 
permeability screen between the blood and the brain. As such, it maintains 
homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). In many CNS disorders, BBB 
integrity is compromised. GC treatment has been demonstrated to improve the 
tightness of the BBB. The responses and effects of GCs are mediated by the 
ubiquitous GC receptor (GR). Ligand-bound GR recognizes and binds to the GC 
response element located within the promoter region of target genes. 
Transactivation of certain target genes leads to improved barrier properties of 
endothelial cells. In this review, we deal with the role of GCs in endothelial 
cell barrier function. First, we describe the mechanisms of GC action at the 
molecular level. Next, we discuss the regulation of the BBB by GCs, with 
emphasis on genes targeted by GCs such as occludin, claudins and VE-cadherin. 
Finally, we present currently available GC therapeutic strategies and their 
limitations.
