Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease 
worldwide, with potential causes stemming from obesity, metabolic syndrome, 
genetic disorders, and drug toxicity. We report a 42-year-old woman with 
lipodystrophy and NAFLD due to a pathogenic variant in the LMNA (D300N) gene. 
This case report attempts to encourage clinicians to consider genetic diseases, 
specifically lipodystrophies, when working up uncommon causes of NAFLD.
