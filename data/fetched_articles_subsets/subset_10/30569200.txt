For long-duration manned space missions to Mars and beyond, reduction of 
astronaut metabolism by torpor, the metabolic state during hibernation of 
animals, would be a game changer: Water and food intake could be reduced by up 
to 75% and thus reducing payload of the spacecraft. Metabolic rate reduction in 
natural torpor is linked to profound changes in biochemical processes, i.e., 
shift from glycolysis to lipolysis and ketone utilization, intensive but 
reversible alterations in organs like the brain and kidney, and in heart rate 
control via Ca2+. This state would prevent degenerative processes due to organ 
disuse and increase resistance against radiation defects. Neuro-endocrine 
factors have been identified as main targets to induce torpor although the exact 
mechanisms are not known yet. The widespread occurrence of torpor in mammals and 
examples of human hypometabolic states support the idea of human torpor and its 
beneficial applications in medicine and space exploration.
