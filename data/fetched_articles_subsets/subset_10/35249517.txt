BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is one of the risk components in the development of 
coronary artery diseases (CAD). Genetic polymorphism in major antioxidant genes 
like Glutathione- S-Transferases (GST) has been associated with increased CAD 
susceptibility and severity.
OBJECTIVE: To get a precise evaluation and to update the association, a 
meta-analysis on GST (GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) polymorphism with CAD was 
performed. Moreover, the combined effect of GSTM1/GSTT1 null genotypes on CAD 
risk has not yet been studied, but it has the highest risk of developing 
diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically 
searched for eligible studies. Case-control studies in the English language and 
with genotypic frequency were selected in order to provide data and calculate 
the odds ratio (OR). OR with 95% CI was calculated, and a random effect model 
was used. NOS scale was used to assess the quality of the included studies.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis indicated that the GSTM1 null genotype and GSTP1 
(Ile105Val) polymorphism is significantly associated with CAD risk with a pooled 
OR-1.38, p=0.01 for GSTM1 and OR-1.19, p=0.04 for GSTP1. The dual null genotype 
of GSTM1-GSTT1 has the highest risk for CAD development (OR-1.59, p=0.003), and 
there is no significant association between GSTT1 null genotype with CAD. In the 
subgroup analysis, GSTM1 showed an increased risk for Asians (OR- 1.68, p=<0.01) 
and smokers (OR-1.98, p=<0.01). Publication bias was not observed.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the GSTM1 and GSTP1 polymorphism can be a 
predictive factor for CAD risk, and a larger sample size is required further to 
confirm the association.
