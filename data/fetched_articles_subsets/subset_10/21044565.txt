The effects on the structural and functional properties of the Kv1.2 
voltage-gated ion channel, caused by selective mutation of voltage sensor domain 
residues, have been investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations. 
Following experiments that have identified mutations of voltage-gated ion 
channels involved in state-dependent omega currents, we observe for both the 
open and closed conformations of the Kv1.2 that specific mutations of S4 
gating-charge residues destabilize the electrostatic network between helices of 
the voltage sensor domain, resulting in the formation of hydrophilic pathways 
linking the intra- and extracellular media. When such mutant channels are 
subject to transmembrane potentials, they conduct cations via these so-called 
"omega pores." This study provides therefore further insight into the molecular 
mechanisms that lead to omega currents, which have been linked to certain 
channelopathies.
