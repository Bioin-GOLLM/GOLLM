BACKGROUND: Frost is one of the main abiotic stresses limiting plant 
distribution and crop production. To cope with the stress, plants evolved 
adaptations known as cold acclimation or chilling tolerance to maximize frost 
tolerance. Cold acclimation is a progressive acquisition of freezing tolerance 
by plants subjected to low non-freezing temperatures which subsequently allows 
them to survive exposure to frost. Lentil is a cool season grain legume that is 
challenged by winter frost in some areas of its cultivation.
RESULTS: To better understand the genetic base of frost tolerance differential 
gene expression in response to cold acclimation was investigated. Recombinant 
inbred lines (RILs) from the cross Precoz x WA8649041 were first classified as 
cold tolerant or cold susceptible according to their response to temperatures 
between -3 to -15 °C. Then, RILs from both extremes of the response curve were 
cold acclimated and the leaf transcriptomes of two bulks each of eight frost 
tolerant and seven cold susceptible RILs were investigated by Deep Super-SAGE 
transcriptome profiling. Thus, four RNA bulks were analysed: the acclimated 
susceptible, the acclimated tolerant and the respective controls (non-acclimated 
susceptible and non-acclimated tolerant). Approximately 16.5 million 26 
nucleotide long Super-SAGE tags were sequenced in the four sets (between ~3 and 
5.4 millions). In total, 133,077 different unitags, each representing a 
particular transcript isoform, were identified in these four sets. Tags which 
showed a significantly different abundance in any of the bulks (fold change ≥4.0 
and a significant p-value <0.001) were selected and used to identify the 
corresponding lentil gene sequence. Three hundred of such lentil sequences were 
identified. Most of their known homologs coded for glycine-rich, cold and 
drought-regulated proteins, dormancy-associated proteins, proline-rich proteins 
(PRPs) and other membrane proteins. These were generally but not exclusively 
over-expressed in the acclimated tolerant lines.
CONCLUSIONS: This set of candidate genes implicated in the response to frost in 
lentil represents an useful base for deeper and more detailed investigations 
into this important agronomic trait in future.
