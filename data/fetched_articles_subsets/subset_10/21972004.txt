CYP19 encodes aromatase, a key enzyme essential for estrogen biosynthesis. 
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2470152 in CYP19 is associated with serum 
estradiol (E2) level and the E2/T (estradiol/testosterone) ratio. A caseâ€‘control 
study including 661 individuals [364 polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients 
and 297 controls] was conducted to assess the association of SNP rs2470152 with 
PCOS. The subjects were genotyped using the polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Hormone levels were 
analyzed among various genotypes. The genotypic distributions of rs2470152 did 
not differ in PCOS patients when compared to the controls. However, differences 
in the E2/T ratio were detected, exhibiting a lower ratio in the heterozygous TC 
genotype in PCOS patients (p=0.01036) and controls (p=0.000). Testosterone 
levels also differed between the three genotypes of PCOS patients (p=0.00625), 
with a higher level in the TC genotype. Therefore, rs2470152 in CYP19 was not a 
major etiological factor for PCOS; however, the heterozygous TC genotype may 
inhibit aromatase activity, resulting in hyperandrogenism, particularly in PCOS 
patients.
