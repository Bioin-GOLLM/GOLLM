The central melanocortin system is essential for the regulation of long-term 
energy homeostasis in humans. Rodent experiments suggest that this system also 
affects glucose metabolism, in particular by modulating peripheral insulin 
sensitivity independently of its effect on adiposity. Rare patients with 
complete genetic defects in the central melanocortin system can provide insight 
into the role of this system in glucose homeostasis in humans. We here describe 
the eighth individual with complete proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency and 
the first with coincidental concomitant type 1 diabetes, which provides a unique 
opportunity to determine the role of melanocortins in glucose homeostasis in 
human. Direct sequencing of the POMC gene in this severely obese patient with 
isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency identified a homozygous 5' 
untranslated region mutation -11C>A, which we find to abolish normal POMC 
protein synthesis, as assessed in vitro. The patient's insulin requirements were 
as expected for his age and pubertal development. This unique patient suggests 
that in humans the central melanocortin system does not seem to affect 
peripheral insulin sensitivity, independently of its effect on adiposity.
