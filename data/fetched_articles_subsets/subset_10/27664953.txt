BACKGROUND: Single-marker and novel gene-based methods were employed to examine 
the associations of the serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinases (SGK) gene family 
with longitudinal blood pressure (BP) changes and hypertension incidence in a 
family-based cohort study.
METHODS: Totally, 1,768 Chinese participants from the Genetic Epidemiology 
Network of Salt Sensitivity (GenSalt) follow-up study were included in the 
current analyses. Nine BP measures were obtained at each of 3 visits during the 
GenSalt follow-up study. Mixed-model and Gene-based analyses were used to 
examine the associations of the SGK gene family with longitudinal BP phenotypes. 
Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple testing.
RESULTS: After an average 7.2-year follow-up, 32.2% (513) of participants free 
of hypertension at baseline developed hypertension. Four novel SNPs in the SGK1 
gene were predictive of the longitudinal BP phenotypes. The major alleles of 
SGK1 rs1763498 and rs114414980 conferred 2.9- and 2.5-fold increased risks of 
hypertension development, respectively (P = 1.0×10-4 and 6.0×10-4, 
respectively). In addition, the major allele of SGK1 rs229133 was significantly 
associated with 0.4mm Hg larger annual increases in systolic BP (P = 4.2×10-4), 
while the major allele of rs6924468 was significantly associated with 0.2mm Hg 
smaller annual increases in diastolic BP (P = 4.2×10-4). Gene-based analyses 
revealed an association of the SGK1 gene with risk of hypertension development 
(P = 7.4×10-3). No evidence for the SGK2 and SGK3 genes was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that the SGK1 gene may 
play a role in long-term BP regulation and hypertension incidence.
