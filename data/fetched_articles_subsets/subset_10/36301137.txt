Mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) cancers have varied responses to 
immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB). We conducted a phase II clinical trial of the 
PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in 24 patients with MMRd endometrial cancer 
(NCT02899793). Patients with mutational MMRd tumors (6 patients) had higher 
response rates and longer survival than those with epigenetic MMRd tumors (18 
patients). Mutation burden was higher in tumors with mutational MMRd compared 
with epigenetic MMRd; however, within each category of MMRd, mutation burden was 
not correlated with ICB response. Pretreatment JAK1 mutations were not 
associated with primary resistance to pembrolizumab. Longitudinal single-cell 
RNA-seq of circulating immune cells revealed contrasting modes of antitumor 
immunity for mutational versus epigenetic MMRd cancers. Whereas effector CD8+ T 
cells correlated with regression of mutational MMRd tumors, activated CD16+ NK 
cells were associated with ICB-responsive epigenetic MMRd tumors. These data 
highlight the interplay between tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic factors that 
influence ICB response.
SIGNIFICANCE: The molecular mechanism of MMRd is associated with response to 
anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in endometrial carcinoma. Tumors with epigenetic MMRd or 
mutational MMRd are correlated with NK cell or CD8+ T cell-driven immunity, 
respectively. Classifying tumors by the mechanism of MMRd may inform clinical 
decision-making regarding cancer immunotherapy. This article is highlighted in 
the In This Issue feature, p. 247.
