We have conducted a multistage genomewide association study, using 1,620,742 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms to systematically investigate the genetic 
factors influencing intrinsic skin pigmentation in a population of South Asian 
descent. Polymorphisms in three genes--SLC24A5, TYR, and SLC45A2--yielded highly 
significant replicated associations with skin-reflectance measurements, an 
indirect measure of melanin content in the skin. The associations detected in 
these three genes, in an additive manner, collectively account for a large 
fraction of the natural variation of skin pigmentation in a South Asian 
population. Our study is the first to interrogate polymorphisms across the 
genome, to find genetic determinants of the natural variation of skin 
pigmentation within a human population.
