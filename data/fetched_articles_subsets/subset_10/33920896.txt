Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disease triggered by 
dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway, consisting of a 
characteristic triad of nonimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal 
failure. The risk of aHUS onset, recurrence, and allograft loss depends on the 
genetic background of a patient. We show a series of cases from a single family 
whose five members were affected by aHUS and presented distinct clinical 
outcomes. Next-generation sequencing revealed combined mutations in both 
complement factor H and membrane cofactor protein CD46. Out of eight siblings, 
aHUS affected three adult brothers, and, subsequently, affected two children of 
an unaffected sister. The first patient died due to aHUS, and two other brothers 
underwent successful kidney transplantation with no aHUS recurrence. The 
younger, 10-month-old child presented with a severe course of the disease with 
cardiac involvement and persistent hemolytic anemia limited by eculizumab, while 
the 2-year-old recovered completely on eculizumab. The study shows a highly 
variable disease penetrance.
