During infections, nucleic acids of pathogens are also engaged in recognition 
via several exogenous and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, such as the 
toll-like receptors, retinoic acid inducible gene-I-like receptors, and 
nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptors. The binding of the 
pathogen-derived nucleic acids to their corresponding sensors initiates certain 
downstream signaling cascades culminating in the release of type-I interferons 
(IFNs), especially IFN-α and other cytokines to induce proinflammatory responses 
towards invading pathogens leading to their clearance from the host. Although 
these sensors are hardwired to recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns, 
like viral and bacterial nucleic acids, under unusual physiological conditions, 
such as excessive cellular stress and increased apoptosis, endogenous 
self-nucleic acids like DNA, RNA, and mitochondrial DNA are also released. The 
presence of these self-nucleic acids in extranuclear compartments or 
extracellular spaces or their association with certain proteins sometimes leads 
to the failure of discriminating mechanisms of nucleic acid sensors leading to 
proinflammatory responses as seen in autoimmune disorders, like systemic lupus 
erythematosus, psoriasis and to some extent in type 1 diabetes (T1D). This 
review discusses the involvement of various nucleic acid sensors in autoimmunity 
and discusses how aberrant recognition of self-nucleic acids by their sensors 
activates the innate immune responses during the pathogenesis of T1D.
