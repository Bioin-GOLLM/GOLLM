In this study, we looked into possible compensatory changes of other adenosine 
receptors (ARs) in A(2A) genetic knockout mice (A2AKO) as well as the functional 
role of nitric oxide (NO) in A(2A) AR-mediated vasodilation. Gene expression of 
ARs from coronary arteries of A(2A) AR wild type mice (A2AWT) and A2AKO was 
studied using real-time PCR. Functional studies were carried out in isolated 
heart and isolated coronary artery preparations. A(2B) AR was found to be 4.5 
fold higher in A2AKO than in A2AWT, while A(2A) AR expression was absent in 
A2AKO. There was no difference in A(1) and A(3) ARs between WT and KO animals. 
The concentration-relaxation curve for adenosine-5'-N-ethylcarboxamide (NECA, 
non-selective AR agonist) in isolated coronary arterial rings in A2AKO was 
shifted to the left when compared to A2AWT. The concentration-response curve for 
A(2B) selective agonist (BAY 60-6583) was also shifted to the left in A2AKO 
hearts. L-NAME, a non-specific NO synthase inhibitor, did not affect baseline 
coronary flow (CF) until the concentration reached 10 microM in A2AWT 
(76.32+/-11.35% from baseline, n=5). In A2AKO, the CF decreased significantly by 
L-NAME only at a higher concentration (100 microM, 93.32+/-5.8% from baseline, 
n=5). L-NMA (1 microM, n=4), another non-specific NO synthase inhibitor, also 
demonstrated similar results in decreasing CF (59.66+/-3.23% from baseline in 
A2AWT, while 81.76+/-8.91% in A2AKO). It was further demonstrated that the 
increase in CF by 100 microM NECA was significantly blunted with 10 microM 
L-NAME (377.08+/-25.23% to 305.41+/-30.73%, n=9) in A2AWT but not in A2AKO 
(153.66+/-22.7% to 143.88+/-36.65%, n=5). Similar results were also found using 
50 nM of CGS-21680 instead of NECA in A2AWT (346+/-22.85 to 277+/-31.39, n=6). 
No change in CF to CGS-21680 was noted in A(2A)AKO. Our data demonstrate, for 
the first time, that coronary A(2B) AR was up-regulated in mice deficient in 
A(2A) AR. We also provide direct evidence supporting a role for NO in A(2A) 
AR-mediated coronary vasodilation. The data further support the role for A(2A) 
AR in the regulation of basal coronary tone through the release of NO.
