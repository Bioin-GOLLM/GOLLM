Tuberous sclerosis is associated with epilepsy in up to 85% of cases, and in 
2/3, the onset is within the first year of life. An early antiepileptic 
treatment is crucial to minimize the consequences of epilepsy on cognition and 
behavior. We present a case report of a child with tuberous sclerosis who 
presented with infantile spasms at the age of 6 months, immediately treated with 
vigabatrin. Because of the presence of a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, he 
also received everolimus since 18 months of age. We might wonder if an earlier 
treatment could have produced a better outcome; in fact, despite a targeted 
combined treatment, he continues to suffer from sporadic focal motor seizures, 
and at the age of 40 months, he presents severe developmental delay with 
autism-like behavior.
