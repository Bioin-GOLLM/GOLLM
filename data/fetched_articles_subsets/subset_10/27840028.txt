Recent studies have revealed the importance of Ki-67 and the chromosome 
periphery in chromosome structure and segregation, but little is known about 
this elusive chromosome compartment. Here we used correlative light and serial 
block-face scanning electron microscopy, which we term 3D-CLEM, to model the 
entire mitotic chromosome complement at ultra-structural resolution. Prophase 
chromosomes exhibit a highly irregular surface appearance with a volume smaller 
than metaphase chromosomes. This may be because of the absence of the periphery, 
which associates with chromosomes only after nucleolar disassembly later in 
prophase. Indeed, the nucleolar volume almost entirely accounts for the extra 
volume found in metaphase chromosomes. Analysis of wild-type and Ki-67-depleted 
chromosomes reveals that the periphery comprises 30%-47% of the entire 
chromosome volume and more than 33% of the protein mass of isolated mitotic 
chromosomes determined by quantitative proteomics. Thus, chromatin makes up a 
surprisingly small percentage of the total mass of metaphase chromosomes.
