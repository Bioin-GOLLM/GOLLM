BACKGROUND: Contradictory results have been reported previously in the analyses 
of cross-reactivity among Blomia tropicalis (Blo t), Dermatophagoides 
pteronyssinus (Der p), and Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f). This study aims to 
investigate the characteristics of co-sensitization and the IgE cross-reactivity 
among them and attempts to identify whether patients are sensitized to Blo t due 
to cross-reaction or true sensitization.
METHODS: Specific IgE (sIgE) in the sera from 1497 allergenic patients was 
determined by ImmunoCAP. Cross-reactivity was analyzed and determined by sIgE 
inhibition with 21 sera samples.
RESULTS: Around 85.50% of patients were sensitized to Der p, 85.37% of patients 
were sensitized to Der f, and 71.54% of patients were sensitized to Blo t. 
Further, 70.14% of patients were co-sensitized to Blo t, Der p, and Der f, and 
only seven patients were sensitized solely to Blo t. With increasing sIgE levels 
for Blo t, the positive rates of severe-level (class 5-6) co-sensitization to 
Der p or Der f significantly increased. Blo t was moderately associated with Der 
p and Der f, with correlation coefficients of 0.6998 and 0.6782, respectively. 
Der p and Der f inhibited IgE binding to Blo t more strongly than Blo t 
inhibited IgE binding to Der p or Der f in the patient groups CBlo t  < CDer p 
and CBlo t  < CDer f .
CONCLUSIONS: This study has established valuable information about the 
co-sensitization and cross-reactivity of Blo t with two Dermatophagoides species 
(Der p and Der f) and helps to provide adequate diagnosis and treatment of the 
mite-allergic patients.
