The incidence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is higher among men than women. 
Susceptibility loci for BCC have been identified through genome-wide association 
studies, and two previous studies have found polygenic risk scores (PRS) to be 
significantly associated with the risk of BCC. However, to our knowledge, 
sex-stratified PRS analyses examining the genetic contribution to BCC risk among 
men and women have not been previously reported. To quantify the contribution of 
genetic variability on the BCC risk by sex, we derived a polygenic risk score 
and estimated the genetic relative risk distribution for men and women. Using 29 
published single nucleotide polymorphisms, we found that the estimated relative 
risk of BCC increases with higher percentiles of the polygenic risk score. For 
men, the estimated risk of BCC is twice the average population risk at the 88th 
percentile, while for women, this occurs at the 99th percentile. Our findings 
indicate that there is a significant impact of genetic variation on the risk of 
developing BCC and that this impact may be greater for men than for women. 
Polygenic risk scores may be clinically useful tools for risk stratification, 
particularly in combination with other known risk factors for BCC development.
