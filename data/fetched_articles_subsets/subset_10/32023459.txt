Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in metabolism and disease, yet 
a comprehensive analysis of the cellular response to oxidative stress is 
lacking. To systematically identify regulators of oxidative stress, we conducted 
genome-wide Cas9/CRISPR and shRNA screens. This revealed a detailed picture of 
diverse pathways that control oxidative stress response, ranging from the TCA 
cycle and DNA repair machineries to iron transport, trafficking, and metabolism. 
Paradoxically, disrupting the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) at the level of 
phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) protects cells against ROS. This 
dramatically alters metabolites in the PPP, consistent with rewiring of upper 
glycolysis to promote antioxidant production. In addition, disruption of 
peroxisomal import unexpectedly increases resistance to oxidative stress by 
altering the localization of catalase. Together, these studies provide insights 
into the roles of peroxisomal matrix import and the PPP in redox biology and 
represent a rich resource for understanding the cellular response to oxidative 
stress.
