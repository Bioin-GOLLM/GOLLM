CONTEXT: KISS1R mutations have been reported in few patients with normosmic 
congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nCHH) (OMIM #146110).
OBJECTIVE: To describe in detail nCHH patients with biallelic KISS1R mutations 
belonging to 2 unrelated families, and to functionally characterize a novel 
KISS1R mutation.
RESULTS: An original mutant, p.Tyr313His, was found in the homozygous state in 3 
affected kindred (2 females and 1 male) from a consanguineous Portuguese family. 
This mutation, located in the seventh transmembrane domain, affects a highly 
conserved amino acid, perturbs the conformation of the transmembrane segment, 
and impairs MAP kinase signaling and intracellular calcium release. In the 
second family, a French Caucasian male patient with nCHH was found to carry two 
recurrent mutations in the compound heterozygous state (p.Leu102Pro/Stop399Arg). 
In this man, pulsatile GnRH (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone) administration 
restored pulsatile LH (Luteinizing Hormone) secretion and testicular hormone 
secretion. Later, long-term combined gonadotropin therapy induced 
spermatogenesis, enabling 3 successive pregnancies that resulted in 2 
miscarriages and the birth of a healthy boy.
CONCLUSION: We show that a novel loss-of-function mutation (p.Tyr313His) in the 
KISS1R gene can cause familial nCHH, revealing the crucial role of this amino 
acid in KISS1R function. The observed restoration of gonadotropin secretion by 
exogenous GnRH administration further supports, in humans, the hypothalamic 
origin of the gonadotropin deficiency in this genetic form of nCHH.
