Despite the clinical development of new adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
drugs, colorectal cancer is still one of the leading causes of cancer-related 
death in human beings. WNT5a, an autocrine and paracrine β-catenin independent 
ligand, has been shown to induce tumor inhibition and carcinogenic signals, 
depending on the type of cancer. In patients with colorectal cancer, WNT5a 
triggers a variety of downstream signaling pathways, which mainly affect the 
migration and invasion of tumor cells. This article reviews the mechanism and 
therapeutic potential of WNT5a in colorectal cancer. In short, an in-depth 
understanding of the role of WNT5a in colorectal cancer is very helpful to 
better deal with this disease.
