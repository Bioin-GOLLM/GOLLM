Based on the observation of reduced stature in relatives of patients with 
acromesomelic dysplasia, Maroteaux type (AMDM), caused by homozygous or compound 
heterozygous mutations in natriuretic peptide receptor-B gene (NPR2), it has 
been suggested that heterozygous mutations in this gene could be responsible for 
the growth impairment observed in some cases of idiopathic short stature (ISS). 
We enrolled 192 unrelated patients with short stature and 192 controls of normal 
height and identified seven heterozygous NPR2 missense or splice site mutations 
all in the short stature patients, including one de novo splice site variant. 
Three of the six inherited variants segregated with short stature in the family. 
Nine additional rare nonsynonymous NPR2 variants were found in three additional 
cohorts. Functional studies identified eight loss-of-function mutations in short 
individuals and one gain-of-function mutation in tall individuals. With these 
data, we were able to rigorously verify that NPR2 functional haploinsufficiency 
contributes to short stature. We estimate a prevalence of NPR2 
haploinsufficiency of between 0 and 1/26 in people with ISS. We suggest that 
NPR2 gain of function may be a more common cause of tall stature than previously 
recognized.
