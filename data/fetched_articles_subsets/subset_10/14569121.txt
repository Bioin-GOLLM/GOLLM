BACKGROUND: Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is an uncommon connective tissue 
disorder of unknown aetiology. The most prominent feature is tortuosity of the 
large arteries, but lengthening, stenosis, and aneurysm formation are also 
frequent.
METHODS: We performed a genomewide screen by homozygosity mapping of three 
consanguineous multiplex families, two from Morocco, and one from Italy, which 
included 11 ATS patients. The two families from Morocco may possibly have a 
common ancestor.
RESULTS: We mapped the ATS gene to chromosome 20q13. Recombinations within an 
extended haplotype of 11 microsatellite markers localised the ATS gene between 
markers D20S836 and D20S109, an interval of 9.5 cM.
CONCLUSIONS: Cloning and completing functional and structural analysis of the 
ATS gene may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of 
elastogenesis.
