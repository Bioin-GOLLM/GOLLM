PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an overview of the role of genes and loci that 
predispose to Paget's disease of bone and related disorders.
RECENT FINDINGS: Studies over the past ten years have seen major advances in 
knowledge on the role of genetic factors in Paget's disease of bone (PDB). 
Genome wide association studies have identified six loci that predispose to the 
disease whereas family based studies have identified a further eight genes that 
cause PDB. This brings the total number of genes and loci implicated in PDB to 
fourteen. Emerging evidence has shown that a number of these genes also 
predispose to multisystem proteinopathy syndromes where PDB is accompanied by 
neurodegeneration and myopathy due to the accumulation of abnormal protein 
aggregates, emphasising the importance of defects in autophagy in the 
pathogenesis of PDB. Genetic factors play a key role in the pathogenesis of PDB 
and the studies in this area have identified several genes previously not 
suspected to play a role in bone metabolism. Genetic testing coupled to targeted 
therapeutic intervention is being explored as a way of halting disease 
progression and improving outcome before irreversible skeletal damage has 
occurred.
