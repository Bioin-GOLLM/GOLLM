The Pseudomonas putida phenol-responsive regulator DmpR is a bacterial enhancer 
binding protein (bEBP) from the AAA+ ATPase family. Even though it was 
discovered more than two decades ago and has been widely used for aromatic 
hydrocarbon sensing, the activation mechanism of DmpR has remained elusive. 
Here, we show that phenol-bound DmpR forms a tetramer composed of two 
head-to-head dimers in a head-to-tail arrangement. The DmpR-phenol complex 
exhibits altered conformations within the C-termini of the sensory domains and 
shows an asymmetric orientation and angle in its coiled-coil linkers. The 
structural changes within the phenol binding sites and the downstream ATPase 
domains suggest that the effector binding signal is propagated through the 
coiled-coil helixes. The tetrameric DmpR-phenol complex interacts with the σ54 
subunit of RNA polymerase in presence of an ATP analogue, indicating that 
DmpR-like bEBPs tetramers utilize a mechanistic mode distinct from that of 
hexameric AAA+ ATPases to activate σ54-dependent transcription.
