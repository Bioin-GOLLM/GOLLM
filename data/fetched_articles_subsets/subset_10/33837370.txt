Fine-tuning cellular physiology in response to intracellular and environmental 
cues requires precise temporal and spatial control of gene expression. 
High-resolution imaging technologies to detect mRNAs and their translation state 
have revealed that all living organisms localize mRNAs in subcellular 
compartments and create translation hotspots, enabling cells to tune gene 
expression locally. Therefore, mRNA localization is a conserved and integral 
part of gene expression regulation from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells. In this 
Review, we discuss the mechanisms of mRNA transport and local mRNA translation 
across the kingdoms of life and at organellar, subcellular and multicellular 
resolution. We also discuss the properties of messenger ribonucleoprotein and 
higher order RNA granules and how they may influence mRNA transport and local 
protein synthesis. Finally, we summarize the technological developments that 
allow us to study mRNA localization and local translation through the 
simultaneous detection of mRNAs and proteins in single cells, mRNA and nascent 
protein single-molecule imaging, and bulk RNA and protein detection methods.
