BACKGROUND: Vitamin D exerts multiple beneficial effects in humans, including 
neuronal, immune, and bone homeostasis and the regulation of cardiovascular 
functions. Recent studies correlate vitamin D with cancer cell growth and 
survival, but meta-analyses on this topic are often not consistent.
METHODS: A systematic search of the PubMed database and the Clinical Trial 
Register was performed to identify all potentially relevant English-language 
scientific papers containing original research articles on the effects of 
vitamin D on human health.
RESULTS: In this review, we analyzed the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
effects of vitamin D against acute and chronic diseases, focusing particularly 
on cancer, immune-related diseases, cardiomyophaties (including heart failure, 
cardiac arrhythmias, and atherosclerosis) and infectious diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D significantly reduces the pro-oxidant systemic and tissue 
biomarkers involved in the development, progression, and recurrence of chronic 
cardiometabolic disease and cancer. The overall picture of this review provides 
the basis for new randomized controlled trials of oral vitamin D supplementation 
in patients with cancer and infectious, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular 
diseases aimed at reducing risk factors for disease recurrence and improving 
quality of life.
