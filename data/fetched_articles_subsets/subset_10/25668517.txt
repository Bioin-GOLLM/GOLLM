RAR-related orphan receptors A (RORA) and B (RORB) and voltage-gated sodium 
channel type 1 (SCN1A) genes play critical roles in the regulation of the 
circadian clock. Evidence has shown an association of RORA and RORB 
polymorphisms with susceptibility to autism and depression. Hence, we tested the 
association of RORA rs12912233, rs16943429, rs880626, rs2290430, and rs12900948; 
RORB rs1157358, rs7022435, rs3750420, and rs3903529; and SCN1A rs3812718 with 
epilepsy risk in the Malaysians. DNA was genotyped in 1789 subjects (39% 
epilepsy patients) by using MassARRAY (Sequenom). Significant association was 
obtained for rs12912233 in Malaysian Chinese (p=0.003). Interaction between 
rs12912233-rs880626 and rs3812718 was associated with the epilepsy risk in the 
subjects overall (p=0.001). Results show that RORA rs12912233 alone might be a 
possible risk variant for epilepsy in Malaysian Chinese, but that, together with 
RORA rs880626 and SCN1A rs3812718, this polymorphism may have a synergistic 
effect in the epilepsy risk in Malaysians.
