Etoposide (ETO) is an anticancer drug that targets topoisomerase II (TOP2). It 
stabilizes a normally transient TOP2-DNA covalent complex (TOP2cc), thus leading 
to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases two (TDP2) is 
directly involved in the repair of TOP2cc by removing phosphotyrosyl peptides 
from 5'-termini of DSBs. Recent studies suggest that additional factors are 
required for TOP2cc repair, which include the proteasome and the zinc finger 
protein associated with TDP2 and TOP2, named ZATT. ZATT may alter the 
conformation of TOP2cc in a way that renders the accessibility of TDP2 for 
TOP2cc removal. In this study, our genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens revealed that ZATT also has a 
TDP2-independent role in promoting cell survival following ETO treatment. ZATT 
KO cells showed relatively higher ETO sensitivity than TDP2-KO cells, and 
ZATT/TDP2 DKO cells displayed additive hypersensitivity to ETO treatment. The 
study using a series of deletion mutants of ZATT determined that the N-terminal 
1-168 residues of ZATT are required for interaction with TOP2 and this 
interaction is critical to ETO sensitivity. Moreover, depletion of ZATT resulted 
in accelerated TOP2 degradation after ETO or cycloheximide (CHX) treatment, 
suggesting that ZATT may increase TOP2 stability and likely participate in TOP2 
turnover. Taken together, this study suggests that ZATT is a critical 
determinant that dictates responses to ETO treatment and targeting. ZATT is a 
promising strategy to increase ETO efficacy for cancer therapy.
