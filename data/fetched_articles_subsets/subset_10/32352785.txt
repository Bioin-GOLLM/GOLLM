On Earth, water plays an active role in cellular life, over several scales of 
distance and time. At a nanoscale, water drives macromolecular conformation 
through hydrophobic forces and at short times acts as a proton donor/acceptor 
providing charge carriers for signal transmission. At longer times and larger 
distances, water controls osmosis, transport, and protein mobility. Neutron 
diffraction experiments augmented by computer simulation, show that the 
three-dimensional shape of the hydration shell of carboxyl and carboxylate 
groups belonging to different molecules is characteristic of each molecule. 
Different hydration shells identify and distinguish specific sites with the same 
chemical structure. This experimental evidence suggests an active role of water 
also in controlling, modulating, and mediating chemical reactions involving 
carboxyl and carboxylate groups.
