Genetic thrombosis risk factors include a sequence variant in the prothrombin 
gene (20210G > A) and factor V Leiden (1691G > A). These single nucleotide 
polymorphisms can be diagnosed with restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(RFLP) analysis, fluorescent genotyping on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, 
Indianapolis, IN), and microarray-based testing on the novel NanoChip electronic 
microarray (NanoChip Molecular Biology Workstation, Nanogen, San Diego, CA). We 
compared these methods for accuracy, time to results, throughput, and 
interpretation. Results from 789 of 800 individual amplicons analyzed on the 
NanoChip were in complete agreement with the other assays. Eleven were "no 
calls" (uninterpreted by the NanoChip system) resulting from failed polymerase 
chain reaction amplifications. Although the NanoChip System, when used in a 
low-throughput setting, requires more overall time than the LightCycler, it is 
nearly equivalent per genotyping call. Owing to minimal sample handling, assay 
results are more reliable on the NanoChip platform and on the LightCycler than 
with RFLP. The NanoChip assay is reliable and may be especially valuable to 
laboratories with a large volume of thrombophilia test requests.
