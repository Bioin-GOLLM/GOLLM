Bacterial polymeric silk is produced by Bacillus sp. strain NE and is composed 
of two proteins, called fibroin and sericin, with several biomedical and 
biotechnological applications. In the current study and for the first time, the 
whole bacterial silk proteins were found capable of exerting antiviral effects 
against herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), adenovirus type 7 (AD7), and 
hepatitis C virus (HCV). The direct interaction between bacterial silk-like 
proteins and both HSV-1 and AD7 showed potent inhibitory activity against viral 
entry with IC50 values determined to be 4.1 and 46.4 μg/mL of protein, 
respectively. The adsorption inhibitory activity of the bacterial silk proteins 
showed a blocking activity against HSV-1 and AD7 with IC50 values determined to 
be 12.5 and 222.4 ± 1.0 μg/mL, respectively. However, the bacterial silk 
proteins exhibited an inhibitory effect on HSV-1 and AD7 replication inside 
infected cells with IC50 values of 9.8 and 109.3 μg/mL, respectively. All these 
results were confirmed by the ability of the bacterial silk proteins to inhibit 
viral polymerases of HSV-1 and AD7 with IC50 values of 164.1 and 11.8 μg/mL, 
respectively. Similarly, the inhibitory effect on HCV replication in peripheral 
blood monocytes (PBMCs) was determined to be 66.2% at concentrations of 100 
μg/mL of the bacterial silk proteins. This antiviral activity against HCV was 
confirmed by the ability of the bacterial silk proteins to reduce the ROS 
generation inside the infected cells to be 50.6% instead of 87.9% inside 
untreated cells. The unique characteristics of the bacterial silk proteins such 
as production in large quantities via large-scale biofermenters, low costs of 
production, and sustainability of bacterial source offer insight into its use as 
a promising agent in fighting viral infection and combating viral outbreaks.
