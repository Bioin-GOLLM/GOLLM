PURPOSE: Osteoporosis increases the risk of fracture and is often considered a 
late effect of breast cancer treatment. We examined the prevalence of 
compromised bone health in a sample of exclusively African-American (AA) breast 
cancer survivors since bone mineral density (BMD) varies by race/ethnicity in 
healthy populations.
METHODS: Using a case-control design, AA women in a weight loss intervention 
previously diagnosed and treated for stages I-IIIa breast cancer were matched 
1:1 on age, race, sex, and BMI with non-cancer population controls (n = 101 
pairs) from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 
Questionnaires and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning were 
completed, and participants were categorized as having normal bone density, low 
bone mass, or osteoporosis using the World Health Organization (WHO) definition 
for femoral neck T-scores.
RESULTS: The majority of these overweight/obese survivors were 6.6 (±4.7) years 
post-diagnosis, had stage II (n = 46) or stage III (n = 16) disease, and treated 
with chemotherapy (76 %), radiation (72 %), and/or adjuvant hormone therapies 
(45 %). Mean femoral neck BMD was significantly lower in cases vs. matched 
non-cancer population controls (0.85 ± 0.15 vs. 0.91 ± 0.14 g/cm(2), 
respectively; p = 0.007). However, the prevalence of low bone mass and 
osteoporosis was low and did not significantly differ between groups (n = 101 
pairs; p = 0.26), even when restricted to those on adjuvant hormone therapies 
(n = 45 pairs; p = 0.75). Using conditional logistic regression, controlling for 
dietary factors and education, the odds of developing compromised bone health in 
AA breast cancer survivors was insignificant (OR 1.5, 95 % CI 0.52, 5.56).
CONCLUSIONS: These null case-control findings challenge the clinical assumption 
that osteoporosis is highly prevalent among all breast cancer survivors, 
providing foundational evidence to support differences by race/ethnicity and 
body weight.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Routine bone density testing and regular 
patient-provider dialogue is critical in overweight/obese AA breast cancer 
survivors to ensure that healthy lifestyle factors (e.g., ideal weight, regular 
weight-bearing exercises, dietary adequacy of calcium and vitamin D) support 
optimal skeletal health.
