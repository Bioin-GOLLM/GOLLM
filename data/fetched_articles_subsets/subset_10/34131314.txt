Despite the known contributions of genes, genetic-guided pharmacotherapy has not 
been routinely implemented for venous thromboembolism (VTE). To examine evidence 
on cost-effectiveness of genetic-guided pharmacotherapy for VTE, we searched six 
databases, websites of four HTA agencies and citations, with independent 
double-reviewers in screening, data extraction, and quality rating. The ten 
eligible studies, all model-based, examined heterogeneous interventions and 
comparators. Findings varied widely; testing was cost-saving in two base-cases, 
cost-effective in four, not cost-effective in three, dominated in one. Of 22 
model variables that changed decisions about cost-effectiveness, 
effectiveness/relative effectiveness of the intervention was the most frequent, 
albeit of poor quality. Studies consistently lacked details on the provision of 
interventions and comparators as well as on model development and validation. 
Besides improving the reporting of interventions, comparators, and 
methodological details, future economic evaluations should examine strategies 
recommended in guidelines and testing key model variables for decision 
uncertainty, to advise clinical implementations.
