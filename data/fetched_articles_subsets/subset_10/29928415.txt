As a rare hematological malignancy, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) has a 
high mortality rate. However, the comprehensive mechanisms of the underlying 
pathogenesis of T-PLL are unknown. The purpose of the present study was to 
investigate the pathogenesis of T-PLL based on a comprehensive bioinformatics 
analysis. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between T-PLL blood cell 
samples and normal peripheral blood cell samples were investigated using the 
GSE5788 Affymetrix microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. To 
investigate the functional changes associated with tumor progression, Gene 
Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses 
were used on the identified DEGs, followed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
and sub-PPI analysis. Transcription factors and tumor-associated genes (TAGs) 
were investigated further. The results identified 84 upregulated genes and 354 
downregulated genes in T-PLL samples when compared with healthy samples. These 
DEGs featured in various functions including cell death and various pathways 
including apoptosis. The functional analysis of DEGs revealed 17 dysregulated 
transcription factors and 37 dysregulated TAGs. Furthermore, the PPI network 
analysis based on node degree (a network topology attribute) identified 61 
genes, including the core downregulated gene of the sub-PPI network, signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3; degree, 13) and the core 
upregulated gene, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1; degree, 5), that may have 
important associations with the progression of T-PLL. Alterations to cell 
functions, including cell death, and pathways, including apoptosis, may 
contribute to the process of T-PLL. Candidate genes identified in the present 
study, including STAT3 and IRS1, should be targets for additional studies.
