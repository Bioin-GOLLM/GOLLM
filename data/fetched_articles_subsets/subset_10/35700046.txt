Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a hereditary disorder that can 
cause vision loss. CTNND1 encodes a cellular adhesion protein p120-catenin 
(p120), which is essential for vascularization with unclear function in 
postnatal physiological angiogenesis. Here, we applied whole-exome sequencing to 
140 probands of FEVR families and identified 3 candidate variants in the human 
CTNND1 gene. We performed inducible deletion of Ctnnd1 in the postnatal mouse 
endothelial cells (ECs) and observed typical phenotypes of FEVR with reactive 
gliosis. Using unbiased proteomics analysis combined with experimental 
approaches, we conclude that p120 is critical for the integrity of adherens 
junctions (AJs) and that p120 activates Wnt signaling activity by protecting 
β-catenin from glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta-ubiqutin-guided 
(Gsk3β-ubiquitin-guided) degradation. Treatment of CTNND1-depleted human retinal 
microvascular ECs with Gsk3β inhibitors LiCl or CHIR-99021 enhanced cell 
proliferation. Moreover, LiCl treatment increased vessel density in 
Ctnnd1-deficient mouse retinas. Variants in CTNND1 caused FEVR by compromising 
the expression of AJs and Wnt signaling activity. Genetic interactions between 
p120 and β-catenin or α-catenin revealed by double-heterozygous deletion in mice 
showed that p120 regulates vascular development through the Wnt/cadherin axis. 
In conclusion, variants in CTNND1 can cause FEVR through the Wnt/cadherin axis.
