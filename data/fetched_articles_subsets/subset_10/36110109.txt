Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare, neurometabolic 
disorder resulting from biallelic mutations in the dopa decarboxylase (DDC) 
gene. This is the first reported case of AADC deficiency in the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE) and describes an Emirati male patient who presented in the first 
few months of life with a severe phenotype of global hypotonia, developmental 
delay and oculogyric crisis. Following whole exome sequencing, a novel 
homozygous mutation in the DDC gene (c.1144G>T, p.Val382Phe) was reported and 
the patient underwent further testing, after which a diagnosis of AADC 
deficiency was confirmed. This mutation has not been previously described, but 
the clinical phenotype and corresponding biochemical profile confirmed that it 
is a pathogenic variant. The patient is currently managed at a tertiary referral 
center in the UAE and is treated in accordance with published guidance on AADC 
deficiency, including the recommended medical therapy combined with 
multidisciplinary care from a team of specialists. Some symptomatic improvements 
have been reported but at 5 years of age the patient continues to exhibit 
profound developmental delay, oculogyric crisis and is prone to recurrent 
respiratory infections. In order to improve outcomes for patients with AADC 
deficiency in the Middle Eastern region, there is an urgent need to raise the 
index of clinical suspicion, particularly among primary care physicians, 
pediatricians, and pediatric neurologists, and to improve access to diagnostic 
testing. This is particularly relevant at the current time, given the ongoing 
development of potentially disease-modifying gene therapy for AADC deficiency.
