Longitudinal studies of rapid disease progression often rely on noisy 
biomarkers; the underlying longitudinal process naturally varies between 
subjects and within an individual subject over time; the process can have 
substantial memory in the form of within-subject correlation. Cystic fibrosis 
lung disease progression is measured by changes in a lung function marker 
(FEV1), such as a prolonged drop in lung function, clinically termed rapid 
decline. Choosing a longitudinal model that estimates rapid decline can be 
challenging, requiring covariate specifications to assess drug effect while 
balancing choices of covariance functions. Two classes of longitudinal models 
have recently been proposed: segmented and stochastic linear mixed effects 
(LMEs) models. With segmented LMEs, random changepoints are used to estimate the 
timing and degree of rapid decline, treating these points as structural breaks 
in the underlying longitudinal process. In contrast, stochastic LMEs, such as 
random walks, are locally linear but utilize continuously changing slopes, 
viewing bouts of rapid decline as localized, sharp changes. We compare commonly 
utilized variants of these approaches through an application using the Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. Changepoint modeling had the worst fit and 
predictive accuracy but certain covariance forms in stochastic LMEs produced 
problematic variance estimates.
