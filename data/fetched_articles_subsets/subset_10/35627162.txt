Synonymous single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) are often considered functionally 
silent, but a few cases of cancer-causing sSNVs have been reported. From 
available databases, we collected four categories of sSNVs: germline, somatic in 
normal tissues, somatic in cancerous tissues, and putative cancer drivers. We 
found that screening sSNVs for recurrence among patients, conservation of the 
affected genomic position, and synVep prediction (synVep is a machine 
learning-based sSNV effect predictor) recovers cancer driver variants (termed 
proposed drivers) and previously unknown putative cancer genes. Of the 2.9 
million somatic sSNVs found in the COSMIC database, we identified 2111 proposed 
cancer driver sSNVs. Of these, 326 sSNVs could be further tagged for possible 
RNA splicing effects, RNA structural changes, and affected RBP motifs. This list 
of proposed cancer driver sSNVs provides computational guidance in prioritizing 
the experimental evaluation of synonymous mutations found in cancers. 
Furthermore, our list of novel potential cancer genes, galvanized by synonymous 
mutations, may highlight yet unexplored cancer mechanisms.
