The secretory properties of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play 
predominant roles in shaping a pro-metastatic tumor microenvironment. The 
present study demonstrated that SLIT2, an axon guidance protein, produced by 
CAFs and promoted gastric cancer (GC) metastasis in two gastric cancer cell 
lines (AGS and MKN45) by binding to roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1). 
Mass-spectrometry analysis revealed that ROBO1 could interact with NEK9, a 
serine/threonine kinase. And their mutual binding activities were further 
enhanced by SLIT2. Domain analysis revealed the kinase domain of NEK9 was 
critical in its interaction with the intracellular domain (ICD) of ROBO1, and it 
also directly phosphorylated tripartite motif containing 28 (TRIM28) and 
cortactin (CTTN) in AGS and MKN45 cells. TRIM28 function as a transcriptional 
elongation factor, which directly facilitate CTTN activation. In addition, 
Bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation identified transcriptional 
regulation of STAT3 and NF-κB p100 by TRIM28, and a synergetic transcription of 
CTTN by STAT3 and NF-κB p100 was also observed in AGS and MKN45. Therefore, 
CAF-derived SLIT2 increased the expression and phosphorylation levels of CTTN, 
which induced cytoskeletal reorganization and GC cells metastasis. A 
simultaneous increase in the expression levels of NEK9, TRIM28 and CTTN was 
found in metastatic GC lesions compared with paired non-cancerous tissues and 
primary cancer lesions via IHC and Multiplex IHC. The analysis of the data from 
a cohort of patients with GC revealed that increased levels of NEK9, TRIM28 and 
CTTN were associated with a decreased overall survival rate. On the whole, these 
findings revealed the connections of CAFs and cancer cells through SLIT2/ROBO1 
and inflammatory signaling, and the key molecules involved in this process may 
serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for GC.
