Copy number variants (CNVs) were detected and analyzed in 14 probands with 
autism and intellectual disability with self-injurious behavior (SIB) resulting 
in tissue damage. For each proband we obtained a clinical history and detailed 
behavioral descriptions. Genetic anomalies were observed in all probands, and 
likely clinical significance could be established in four cases. This included 
two cases having novel, de novo copy number variants and two cases having 
variants likely to have functional significance. These cases included segmental 
trisomy 14, segmental monosomy 21, and variants predicted to disrupt the 
function of ZEB2 (encoding a transcription factor) and HTR2C (encoding a 
serotonin receptor). Our results identify variants in regions previously 
implicated in intellectual disability and suggest candidate genes that could 
contribute to the etiology of SIB.
