BACKGROUND: The genetic and pathogenic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 have 
evolved from the original isolated strains; however, the changes in viral 
virulence have not been fully defined. In this study, we analyzed the 
association between the severity of the pathogenesis of pneumonia in humans and 
SARS-CoV-2 variants that have been prevalent to date.
METHODS: We examined changes in the variants and tropism of SARS-CoV-2. A total 
of 514 patients admitted between February 2020 and August 2022 were included and 
evaluated for pneumonia by computed tomography (CT) as a surrogate of viral 
tropism.
RESULTS: The prevalence of pneumonia for each variant was as follows: D614G 
(57%, 65/114), Alpha (67%, 41/61), Delta (49%, 41/84), Omicron BA.1.1 (26%, 
43/163), and Omicron BA.2 (11%, 10/92). The pneumonia prevalence in unvaccinated 
patients progressively declined from 70% to 11% as the variants changed: D614G 
(56%, 61/108), Alpha (70%, 26/37), Delta (60%, 38/63), BA.1.1 (52%, 15/29), and 
BA.2 (11%, 2/19). The presence of pneumonia in vaccinated patients was as 
follows: Delta (16%, 3/19), BA.1.1 (21%, 27/129), and BA.2 (11%, 8/73). Compared 
with D614G, the areas of lung involvement were also significantly reduced in 
BA.1.1 and BA.2 variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous variants, there was a marked decrease in 
pneumonia prevalence and lung involvement in patients infected with Omicron 
owing to decreased tropism in the lungs that hindered viral proliferation in the 
alveolar epithelial tissue. Nevertheless, older, high-risk patients with 
comorbidities who are infected with an Omicron variant can still develop 
pneumonia and require early treatment.

Plain Language Summary: The SARS-CoV-2 virus changes over time with the 
differing viruses described as variants. The different variants of SARS-CoV-2 
have an impact on how easily they infect people and the effects they have on 
infected individuals. Here, we examined images of the lungs of patients 
hospitalized with COVID-19 to investigate whether they had pneumonia, a type of 
swelling in the lung. Compared with the variant found early in the pandemic, the 
more recent Omicron variant led to a decreased rate of pneumonia in infected 
individuals. Our findings emphasize the need for early treatment, as pneumonia 
may progress in older patients or those with other illnesses.
