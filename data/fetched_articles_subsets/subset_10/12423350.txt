Upon mutation of Asp153 by asparagine, the catalytic activity of agmatinase 
(agmatine ureohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.11) from Escherichia coli was reduced to about 
5% of wild-type activity. Tryptophan emission fluorescence (lambdamax = 340 nm), 
and CD spectra were nearly identical for wild-type and D153N agmatinases. The Km 
value for agmatine (1.6 +/- 0.1 mm), as well as the Ki for putrescine inhibition 
(12 +/- 2 mm) and the interaction of the enzyme with the required metal ion, 
were also not altered by mutation. Three-dimensional models, generated by 
homology modelling techniques, indicated that the side chains of Asp153 and 
Asn153 can perfectly fit in essentially the same position in the active site of 
E. coli agmatinase. Asp153 is suggested to be involved, by hydrogen bond 
formation, in the stabilization and orientation of a metal-bound hydroxide for 
optimal attack on the guanidinium carbon of agmatine. Thus, the disruption of 
this hydrogen bond is the likely cause of the greately decreased catalytic 
efficiency of the D153N variant.
