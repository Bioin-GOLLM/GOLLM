Activation of tumor suppressors for the treatment of human cancer has been a 
long sought, yet elusive, strategy. PTEN is a critical tumor suppressive 
phosphatase that is active in its dimer configuration at the plasma membrane. 
Polyubiquitination by the ubiquitin E3 ligase WWP1 (WW domain-containing 
ubiquitin E3 ligase 1) suppressed the dimerization, membrane recruitment, and 
function of PTEN. Either genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of WWP1 
triggered PTEN reactivation and unleashed tumor suppressive activity. WWP1 
appears to be a direct MYC (MYC proto-oncogene) target gene and was critical for 
MYC-driven tumorigenesis. We identified indole-3-carbinol, a compound found in 
cruciferous vegetables, as a natural and potent WWP1 inhibitor. Thus, our 
findings unravel a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer prevention and 
treatment through PTEN reactivation.
