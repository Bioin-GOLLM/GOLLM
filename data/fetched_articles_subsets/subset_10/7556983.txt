Mitochondrial DNA is exclusively maternally inherited. We recently found the 
prevalence of diabetic patients with an A to G transition at position 3243 of 
leucine tRNA (3243 base pair (bp) mutation) to be nearly 1% in randomly selected 
Japanese subjects. Here, we report the higher prevalence of diabetic patients 
with the 3243 bp mutation in a specific Japanese population of women attending a 
diabetic pregnancy clinic. Of 102 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus 6 (5.9%) were positive for the mutation, 1 (8.3%) of 12 patients with 
gestational diabetes and 2 (5.9%) out of 34 borderline diabetic patients. In 
contrast, none of 64 patients (0%) with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus had 
the 3243 bp mutation. Moreover, there was a difference in the prevalence of 
spontaneous abortions between patients with and without this mutation (27.3 vs 
12.4%). Among nine probands with the mutation, four had a history of one 
spontaneous abortion (p = 0.0518) and two had a history of two abortions (p = 
0.0479). Two probands had a spontaneous abortion even while under strict 
diabetic metabolic control. The 3243 bp mutation thus may cause spontaneous 
abortion during pregnancy.
