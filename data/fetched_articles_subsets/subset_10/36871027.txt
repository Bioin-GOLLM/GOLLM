BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a more common non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL). This study aims to explore the prognostic value of PIM kinase 
family in DLBCL and its relationship with the immune microenvironment, to 
provide a certain reference for the prognosis and treatment of DLBCL.
METHODS: The prognostic value of PIM kinase family in DLBCL from the data set 
GSE10846 was verified through survival analysis and cox regression analysis. 
Mutations in PIM kinase family and its relationship with immune cell 
infiltration were explored with online cBioPortal, TIMER database, and 
single-gene GSEA analysis. Finally, the expression of PIM kinase family in 
tissues from DLBCL clinical samples was validated through immunohistochemical 
staining.
RESULTS: The proteins of PIM kinase family were highly expressed in DLBCL 
patients, which are good prognostic factors for DLBCL patients. Then, PIM1-3 
proteins were positively correlated with the immune infiltration of B cells, 
whose types of mutations also showed different degrees of correlation with B 
cells. PIM kinase family proteins also showed a high correlation with PDL1. In 
addition, PIM kinase family was also associated with the commonly mutated genes 
in DLBCL, such as MYD88, MYC, and BTK.
CONCLUSION: PIM kinase family may be a potential therapeutic target for DLBCL 
patients.
