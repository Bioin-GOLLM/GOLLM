Oncogenic driver mutations are those that provide a proliferative or survival 
advantage to neoplastic cells, resulting in clonal selection. Although most 
cancer-causing mutations have been detected in the protein-coding regions of the 
cancer genome; driver mutations have recently also been discovered within 
noncoding genomic sequences. Thus, a current challenge is to gain precise 
understanding of how these unique genomic elements function in cancer 
pathogenesis, while clarifying mechanisms of gene regulation and identifying new 
targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we report a C-to-T single nucleotide 
transition that occurs as a somatic mutation in noncoding sequences 4â€‰kb 
upstream of the transcriptional start site of the LMO1 oncogene in primary 
samples from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This single 
nucleotide alteration conforms to an APOBEC-like cytidine deaminase mutational 
signature, and generates a new binding site for the MYB transcription factor, 
leading to the formation of an aberrant transcriptional enhancer complex that 
drives high levels of expression of the LMO1 oncogene. Since APOBEC-signature 
mutations are common in a broad spectrum of human cancers, we suggest that 
noncoding nucleotide transitions such as the one described here may activate 
potent oncogenic enhancers not only in T-lymphoid cells but in other cell 
lineages as well.
