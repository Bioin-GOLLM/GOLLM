BACKGROUND: Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma causes over 75% of skin cancer-related 
deaths, and it is clear that many factors may contribute to the outcome. Matrix 
Metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in the degradation and 
remodeling of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane that, in turn, 
modulate cell division, migration and angiogenesis. Some polymorphisms are known 
to influence gene expression, protein activity, stability, and interactions, and 
they were shown to be associated with certain tumor phenotypes and cancer risk.
METHODS: We tested seven polymorphisms within the MMP-9 gene in 1002 patients 
with melanoma in order to evaluate germline genetic variants and their 
association with progression and known risk factors of melanoma. The 
polymorphisms were selected based on previously published reports and their 
known or potential functional relevance using in-silico methods. Germline DNA 
was then genotyped using pyrosequencing, melting temperature profiles, 
heteroduplex analysis, and fragment size analysis.
RESULTS: We found that reference alleles were present in higher frequency in 
patients who tend to sunburn, have family history of melanoma, higher melanoma 
stage, intransit metastasis and desmoplastic melanomas among others. However, 
after adjustment for age, sex, phenotypic index, moles, and freckles only Q279R, 
P574R and R668Q had significant associations with intransit metastasis, 
propensity to tan/sunburn and primary melanoma site.
CONCLUSION: This study does not provide strong evidence for further 
investigation into the role of the MMP-9 SNPs in melanoma progression.
