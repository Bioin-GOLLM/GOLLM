AIMS: Dysregulation of the immune system has previously been implicated in 
glaucoma pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the potential association 
of SNPs in the IL1 gene cluster, consisting of nine genes, with primary 
open-angle glaucoma (POAG) cases. These cases presented with low to normal 
intraocular pressures (<20â€‰mmHg), and are referred to as non-high tension 
glaucoma (non-HTG) cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this biphasic study, the discovery phase was conducted 
with 198 non-HTG cases and 112 controls from eastern India. A total of 68 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the IL1 nine-gene cluster region were 
genotyped using the MALDI-TOF based Sequenom platform. SNPs, which were found to 
be significantly associated with non-HTG cases in the first phase of the study, 
were further genotyped by Sanger sequencing in a replication cohort consisting 
of 194 non-HTG cases and 242 controls.
RESULTS: In the discovery phase, two nonsynonymous SNPs (rs3811046 and 
rs3811047), located in the IL1F7 gene and in an intergenic region, respectively 
were found to be weakly associated with non-HTG cases. However, the association 
was not sustained in the replication cohort.
CONCLUSION: Our study did not reveal any reproducible association of SNPs in the 
IL1 gene cluster with POAG.
