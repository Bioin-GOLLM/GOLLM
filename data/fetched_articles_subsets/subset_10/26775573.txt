Recently, developments of therapies that target abnormally activated signaling 
pathways are increasing for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. EGFR 
mutations are found in about 10% of lung cancers, especially in adenocarcinoma, 
women and non-smokers. Three EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib) 
received a European marketing authorization for up to first line treatment of 
EGFR mutated NSCLC. Effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors is higher than conventional 
chemotherapy. Third generation EGFR inhibitors (rociletinib, AZD9291) are 
effective for patients who develop a resistance mutation such as T790M 
resistance mutation; they obtained temporary authorization for use in France in 
2015. The EML4-ALK translocation is found in about 5% of NSCLC and more 
particularly in adenocarcinoma of young non-smoking patients. Crizotinib is a 
new therapeutic standard in ALK translocated NSCLC in second line. Ceritinib is 
a 2nd generation ALK inhibitor which received a European marketing authorization 
for up to treatment of ALK translocated NSCLC after progression with crizotinib. 
INCA supports ACSé program evaluating the efficacy of crizotinib in NSCLC 
amplified for MET or translocated for ROS1 and ACSé program evaluating the 
efficacy of vemurafenib in tumors non melanoma mutated V600E BRAF. The role of 
other biomarkers such as KRAS, BRAF, HER2 and PI3KCA mutations remains to be 
defined in NSCLC.
