In this work, we examined the genetic diversity and evolution of the WAG-2 gene 
based on new WAG-2 alleles isolated from wheat and its relatives. Only single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and no insertions and deletions (indels) were 
found in exon sequences of WAG-2 from different species. More SNPs and indels 
occurred in introns than in exons. For exons, exons+introns and introns, the 
nucleotide polymorphism Ï€ decreased from diploid and tetraploid genotypes to 
hexaploid genotypes. This finding indicated that the diversity of WAG-2 in 
diploids was greater than in hexaploids because of the strong selection pressure 
on the latter. All dn/ds ratios were < 1.0, indicating that WAG-2 belongs to a 
conserved gene affected by negative selection. Thirty-nine of the 57 particular 
SNPs and eight of the 10 indels were detected in diploid species. The degree of 
divergence in intron length among WAG-2 clones and phylogenetic tree topology 
suggested the existence of three homoeologs in the A, B or D genome of common 
wheat. Wheat AG-like genes were divided into WAG-1 and WAG-2 clades. The latter 
clade contained WAG-2, OsMADS3 and ZMM2 genes, indicating functional homoeology 
among them.
