Split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is a limb malformation with underdeveloped 
or absent central digital rays, clefts of hands and feet, and variable 
syndactyly of the remaining digits. There are six types of SHFM. Here, we report 
a boy with SHFM type 3 having normal 4th and 5th digits, absent 2nd and 3rd 
digits, and a 4th finger flexion deformity, as well as absent 2nd, 3rd and 4th 
toes bilaterally. His father, two paternal uncles, and two paternal first 
cousins have similar phenotype. Chromosome analysis showed a normal male 
karyotype. A 514 kb gain at 10q24.31-q24.32 (chr10:102,962,134-103,476,346, 
hg19) was identified using 6.0 Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray, 
resulting in the duplication of nine genes, including BTRC and FBXW4. A detailed 
systematic review of literature and mapping of breakpoints using microarray data 
from all reported cases in PubMed and DECIPHER were conducted, and exon 1 of 
BTRC gene was identified as the critical region responsible for the SHFM3 
phenotype. The potential mechanism and future studies of this critical region 
causing the SHFM3 phenotype are discussed.
