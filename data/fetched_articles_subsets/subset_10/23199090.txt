The 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is a standard treatment for 
patients with colorectal cancer. However, a relevant number of patients suffer 
from severe toxic side effects, such as haemotoxicity, while lacking clinical 
response to adjuvant therapy. The inter-individual variations of drug toxicity 
and efficacy of the pyrimidine antagonist observed in clinical practice are 
mainly determined by genetic polymorphisms. The screening of genotypes, such as 
thymidylate synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, methylene 
tetrahydrofolate reductase, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase or glutathione 
S-transferase, could help identifying those patients with colorectal carcinoma 
who can actually benefit from a 5-FU-based therapy. The current chapter 
elucidates the roles of the polymorphisms in the enzymes involved in the 5-FU 
metabolic pathway as prognostic and predictive markers. It reports on the 
relationship between various genotypes in patients with colorectal carcinoma and 
their responsiveness to a 5-FU-based chemotherapy, and concludes with an outlook 
on possible future directions in treatment of colorectal cancer.
