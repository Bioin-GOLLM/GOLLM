Acute pancreatitis (AP) continues to present a substantial burden to patients 
and healthcare personnel. Despite its occasionally severe progression and high 
mortality rate, there is no specific therapy that could be routinely applied in 
patients with AP. Here, we review treatment possibilities in AP, describe how 
the treatment approaches have changed in pancreatic cancer as an analogy, and 
point out potential causes for the failure of clinical trials on AP. We 
highlight that instead of attempting to discover generalized treatment options 
that could be used in any AP patient, it is time for a paradigm shift in the 
treatment of AP, which would help to focus more on individual patients or 
specific patient subpopulations when designing clinical trials and therapeutic 
approaches (similarly as in pancreatic cancer). Since the recruitment of 
specific patient subpopulations with AP could take excessive time if clinical 
centers work separately, the development of precision medicine in AP would 
require to establish an expert committee, eg, Pancreatitis Precision Medicine 
Interest Group, which could organize and coordinate the activities of the joined 
centers. With the joined forces of expert clinicians and leading centers, a new 
era could start in the treatment of AP, in which personalized treatment options 
could be discovered and introduced to efficiently reduce the burden of the 
disease on patients and healthcare workers.
