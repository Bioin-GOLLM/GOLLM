L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (LTCCs), particularly Cav1.2 LTCCs, 
play fundamental roles in cellular responses to mechanical stimuli in 
osteoblasts. Numerous studies have shown that mechanical loading promotes bone 
formation, whereas the removal of this stimulus under microgravity conditions 
results in a reduction in bone mass. However, whether microgravity exerts an 
influence on LTCCs in osteoblasts and whether this influence is a possible 
mechanism underlying the observed bone loss remain unclear. In the present 
study, we demonstrated that simulated microgravity substantially inhibited LTCC 
currents and suppressed Cav1.2 at the protein level in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like 
cells. In addition, reduced Cav1.2 protein levels decreased LTCC currents in 
MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, simulated microgravity increased miR-103 expression. 
Cav1.2 expression and LTCC current densities both significantly increased in 
cells that were transfected with a miR-103 inhibitor under mechanical unloading 
conditions. These results suggest that simulated microgravity substantially 
inhibits LTCC currents in osteoblasts by suppressing Cav1.2 expression. 
Furthermore, the down-regulation of Cav1.2 expression and the inhibition of 
LTCCs caused by mechanical unloading in osteoblasts are partially due to miR-103 
up-regulation. Our study provides a novel mechanism for microgravity-induced 
detrimental effects on osteoblasts, offering a new avenue to further investigate 
the bone loss induced by microgravity.
