Thalidomide and its derivatives lenalidomide and pomalidomide (IMiDs) are 
effective treatments of haematologic malignancies. It was shown that IMiDs 
impart gain-of-function properties to the CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (CRL4CRBN) 
ubiquitin ligase that enable binding, ubiquitination and degradation of key 
therapeutic targets such as IKZF1, IKZF3 and CSNK1A1. While these substrates 
have been implicated as efficacy targets in multiple myeloma (MM) and 5q 
deletion associated myelodysplastic syndrome (del(5q)-MDS), other targets likely 
exist. Using a pulse-chase SILAC mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we 
demonstrate that lenalidomide induces the ubiquitination and degradation of 
ZFP91. We establish ZFP91 as a bona fide IMiD-dependent CRL4CRBN substrate and 
further show that ZFP91 harbours a zinc finger (ZnF) motif, related to the 
IKZF1/3 ZnF, critical for IMiD-dependent CRBN binding. These findings 
demonstrate that single time point pulse-chase SILAC mass spectrometry-based 
proteomics (pSILAC MS) is a sensitive approach for target identification of 
small molecules inducing selective protein degradation.
