BACKGROUND: Heterogeneous breast cancer is the most common cause of 
cancer-related mortality. Obesity defined by BMI is a known major risk factor 
for breast cancer.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the role of obesity 
related-polymorphisms rs9939609 Fat Mass and Obesity-associated (FTO) and 
rs17782313 MC4R in breast cancer development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Matched peripheral blood serum was obtained from 64 
breast cancer patients and 83 normal controls. Height and weight were measured 
to calculate BMI. All were genotyped for the SNPs rs9939609 and rs17782313 using 
a Tetra-primer ARMS-PCR method. For statistical analysis, the chi-square test 
and SPSS software were used.
RESULTS: In subgroup analyses defined by BMI, FTO rs9939609 genotypes (TT/AA/AT) 
were significantly associated with the risk of breast cancer only in non-obese 
subjects (p < 0.005). TT genotypes of MC4R rs17782313 in non-obese and genotypes 
TT/CC in the overweight group were also statistically associated with breast 
cancer (p &lt; 0.005). No significant associations between any variants and 
breast cancer risk were seen in obese subjects.
CONCLUSION: Based on the absence of an association between obesity-related SNPs 
and breast cancer in obese subjects, it is proposed that weight gain in Iranian 
women will help prevent breast cancer risk. The result help for preparing and 
designing a safe and versatile recombinant drug in future.
