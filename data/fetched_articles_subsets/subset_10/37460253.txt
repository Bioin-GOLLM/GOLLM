Gastric cancer stem-like cells (GCSCs) possess stem cell properties, such as 
self-renewal and tumorigenicity, which are known to induce high chemoresistance 
and metastasis. These characteristics of GCSCs are further enhanced by 
autophagy, worsening the prognosis of patients. Currently, the mechanisms 
involved in the induction of stemness in GCSCs during autophagy remain unclear. 
In this study, we compared the cellular responses of GCSCs with those of gastric 
cancer intestinal cells (GCICs) whose stemness is not induced by autophagy. In 
response to glucose starvation, the levels of β-catenin and stemness-related 
genes were upregulated in GCSCs, while the levels of β-catenin declined in 
GCICs. The pattern of deubiquitinase ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L3 (UCH-L3) 
expression in GCSCs and GCICs was similar to that of β-catenin expression 
depending on glucose deprivation. We also observed that inhibition of UCH-L3 
activity reduced β-catenin protein levels. The interaction between UCH-L3 and 
β-catenin proteins was confirmed, and it reduced the ubiquitination of 
β-catenin. Our results suggest that UCH-L3 induces the stabilization of 
β-catenin, which is required to promote stemness during autophagy activation. 
Also, UCH-L3 expression was regulated by c-Fos, and the levels of c-Fos 
increased in response to autophagy activation. In summary, our findings suggest 
that the inhibition of UCH-L3 during nutrient deprivation could suppress stress 
resistance of GCSCs and increase the survival rates of gastric cancer patients.
