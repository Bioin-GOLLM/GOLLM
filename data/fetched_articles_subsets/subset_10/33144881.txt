PURPOSE: The availability of immune checkpoint inhibitors has deeply changed the 
therapeutic scenario of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Up until now, chemotherapy still represents the first-line treatment 
for patients with advanced NSCLC not harbouring genetic mutations or lacking 
high expression of programmed death ligand even if the addition of immunotherapy 
to first-line chemotherapy has recently been shown to improve clinical outcome. 
We carried out a multi-institutional retrospective analysis on third-line 
chemotherapy with metronomic oral vinorelbine (VNR) in a series of patients with 
metastatic NSCLC pre-treated with first-line chemotherapy and second-line 
immunotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with metastatic NSCLC with progressive 
disease after first-line chemotherapy and subsequent immunotherapy were treated 
with metronomic oral VNR continuously at the fixed dose of 30 mg three times per 
week.
RESULTS: A partial response was achieved in 4 patients (13.3%), while 10 
patients (33.3%) displayed disease stabilisation for an overall disease control 
rate of 46.7%. Median progression-free survival was 3.9 months (range 1-13 
months) and median OS reached 8.1 months (range 4.0-24.0+ months) with a 
12-month survival rate of 22%.
CONCLUSION: Oral metronomic VNR appears to be active and safe in patients with 
metastatic NSCLC in progression after first-line chemotherapy and second-line 
immunotherapy. The results reported, although from a limited sample, may suggest 
its use for long-term stabilisation of the disease with good patient compliance.
