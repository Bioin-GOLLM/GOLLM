Metal sites in biology often exhibit unique spectroscopic features that reflect 
novel geometric and electronic structures imposed by the protein that are key to 
reactivity. The blue copper active site involved in long range, rapid biological 
electron transfer is a classic example. This review presents an overview of both 
traditional and synchrotron based spectroscopic methods and their coupling to 
electronic structure calculations to understand the unique features of the blue 
copper active site, their contributions to function and the role of the protein 
in determining the geometric and electronic structure of the active site (called 
the "entatic state"). The relation of this active site to other biological 
electron transfer sites is further developed. In particular, ultrafast XFEL 
spectroscopy is used to evaluate the methionine-S-Fe bond in cytochrome c, and 
its entatic control by the protein in determining function (electron transfer 
vs. apoptosis).
