AIM: To investigate daclatasvir (DCV) and asunaprevir (ASV) efficacy in 
hepatitis C (HCV) patients, with respect to resistance-associated substitutions 
(RASs).
METHODS: A total of 392 HCV-infected patients from multiple centers were 
included in this study. We evaluated their clinical courses and sustained 
virologic responses (SVR) according to pretreatment factors (gender, age, 
history of interferon-based regimens, platelet counts, level of viremia, 
pretreatment NA5A:L31, and Y93 substitutions). We also analyzed the pretreatment 
and post-treatment major RASs of NS3:D168, NS5A:L31 and Y93 substitutions using 
a direct-sequencing method in 17 patients who were unable to achieve SVR at 12 
wk after treatment completion (SVR12).
RESULTS: The overall SVR12 rate was 88.3%. Thirty-one patients discontinued 
treatment before 24 wk because of adverse events, 23 of whom achieved SVR12. 
There were no significant differences in SVR12 rates with respect to gender, 
age, history of interferon-based regimens, and platelet counts. The SVR12 rate 
in patients with viral loads of â‰¥ 6.0 log IU/mL was significantly lower than 
those with viral loads of < 6.0 log IU/mL (P < 0.001). The SVR12 rate in 
patients with Y93 substitution-positive was significantly lower than those with 
Y93 substitution-negative (P < 0.001). The L31 substitution-positive group 
showed a lower SVR12 rate than the L31 substitution-negative group, but the 
difference was not statistically significant. Seventeen patients who did not 
achieve SVR12 and had available pretreatment and post-treatment sera had 
additional RASs in NS3:D168, NS5:L31, and Y93 substitution at treatment failure.
CONCLUSION: Combination of DCV and ASV is associated with a high SVR rate. 
Baseline RASs should be thoroughly assessed to avoid additional RASs after 
treatment failure.
