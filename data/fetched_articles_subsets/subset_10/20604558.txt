The drug resistance of various clinically available HIV-1 protease inhibitors 
has been studied using a new computational protocol, that is, computational 
mutation scanning (CMS), leading to valuable insights into the resistance 
mechanisms and structure-resistance correction of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors 
associated with a variety of active site and nonactive site mutations. By using 
the CMS method, the calculated mutation-caused shifts of the binding free 
energies linearly correlate very well with those derived from the corresponding 
experimental data, suggesting that the CMS protocol may be used as a generalized 
approach to predict drug resistance associated with amino acid mutations. 
Because it is essentially important for understanding the structure-resistance 
correlation and for structure-based drug design to develop an effective 
computational protocol for drug resistance prediction, the reasonable and 
computationally efficient CMS protocol for drug resistance prediction should be 
valuable for future structure-based design and discovery of antiresistance drugs 
in various therapeutic areas.
