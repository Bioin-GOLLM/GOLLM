Myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) is a soft tissue sarcoma characterized by a recurrent 
t(12;16) translocation. Although tumors are initially radio- and chemosensitive, 
the management of inoperable or metastatic MLS can be challenging. Therefore, 
our aim was to identify novel targets for systemic therapy. We performed an in 
vitro high-throughput drug screen using three MLS cell lines (402091, 1765092, 
DL-221), which were treated with 273 different drugs at four different 
concentrations. Cell lines and tissue microarrays were used for validation. As 
expected, all cell lines revealed a strong growth inhibition to conventional 
chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines and taxanes. A good response was 
observed to compounds interfering with Src and the mTOR pathway, which are known 
to be affected in these tumors. Moreover, BIRC5 was important for MLS survival 
because a strong inhibitory effect was seen at low concentration using the 
survivin inhibitor YM155, and siRNA for BIRC5 decreased cell viability. 
Immunohistochemistry revealed abundant expression of survivin restricted to the 
nucleus in all 32 tested primary tumor specimens. Inhibition of survivin in 
402-91 and 1765-92 by YM155 increased the percentage S-phase but did not induce 
apoptosis, which warrants further investigation before application in the 
treatment of metastatic MLS. Thus, using a 273-compound drug screen, we 
confirmed previously identified targets (mTOR, Src) in MLS and demonstrate 
survivin as essential for MLS survival.
