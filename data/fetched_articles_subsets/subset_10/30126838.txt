KIF1Bβ is a kinesin-3 family anterograde motor protein essential for neuronal 
development, viability, and function. KIF1Bβ mutations have previously been 
reported in a limited number of pedigrees of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A 
(CMT2A) neuropathy. However, the gene responsible for CMT2A is still 
controversial, and the mechanism of pathogenesis remains elusive. In this study, 
we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase IGF1R is a new direct binding partner 
of KIF1Bβ, and its binding and transport is specifically impaired by the Y1087C 
mutation of KIF1Bβ, which we detected in hereditary neuropathic patients. The 
axonal outgrowth and IGF-I signaling of Kif1b-/- neurons were significantly 
impaired, consistent with decreased surface IGF1R expression. The complementary 
capacity of KIF1Bβ-Y1087C of these phenotypes was significantly impaired, but 
the binding capacity to synaptic vesicle precursors was not affected. These data 
have supported the relevance of KIF1Bβ in IGF1R transport, which may give new 
clue to the neuropathic pathogenesis.
