BACKGROUND: Non-motor symptoms are increasingly recognized as important features 
of Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 mutations are common causes of familial and 
sporadic PD. Non-motor features have not been yet comprehensively evaluated in 
LRRK2 transgenic mouse models.
OBJECTIVE: Using a transgenic mouse model overexpressing the R1441G mutation of 
the human LRRK2 gene, we have investigated the longitudinal correlation between 
motor and non-motor symptoms and determined if specific non-motor phenotypes 
precede motor symptoms.
METHODOLOGY: We investigated the onset of motor and non-motor phenotypes on the 
LRRK2(R1441G) BAC transgenic mice and their littermate controls from 4 to 21 
month-old using a battery of behavioral tests. The transgenic mutant mice 
displayed mild hypokinesia in the open field from 16 months old, with 
gastrointestinal dysfunctions beginning at 6 months old. Non-motor features such 
as depression and anxiety-like behaviors, sensorial functions (pain sensitivity 
and olfaction), and learning and memory abilities in the passive avoidance test 
were similar in the transgenic animals compared to littermate controls.
CONCLUSIONS: LRRK2(R1441G) BAC transgenic mice displayed gastrointestinal 
dysfunction at an early stage but did not have abnormalities in fine behaviors, 
olfaction, pain sensitivity, mood disorders and learning and memory compared to 
non-transgenic littermate controls. The observations on olfaction and 
gastrointestinal dysfunction in this model validate findings in human carriers. 
These mice did recapitulate mild Parkinsonian motor features at late stages but 
compensatory mechanisms modulating the progression of PD in these models should 
be further evaluated.
