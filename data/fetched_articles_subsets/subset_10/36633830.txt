The plateau environment impacts male reproductive function, causing decreased 
sperm quality and testosterone levels. L-carnitine can improve the semen 
microenvironment. However, the role of L-carnitine in a high-altitude 
environment remains unclear. In our study, we investigated the effects of 
L-carnitine administration in a male Wistar rat reproductive system injury model 
in the context of a simulated high-altitude environment. Rats were randomly 
divided into a normal control group (group A1, A2-low dose and A3-high dose) and 
high-altitude model groups (group B, C-low dose and D-high dose) with 20 rats in 
each group. With the exception of the normal control group exposed to normoxic 
conditions, the other groups were maintained in a hypobaric oxygen chamber that 
simulated an altitude of 6000 m for 28 days. In the experimental period, the 
low-dose groups (A2 and C) were administered 50 mg/kg L-carnitine via 
intraperitoneal injection once a day, and the high-dose groups (A3 and D) were 
given 100 mg/kg. After the feeding period, blood samples were collected to 
assess blood gas, serum hormone levels and oxidative stress. Sperm from the 
epididymis were collected to analyse various sperm parameters. After obtaining 
the testicular tissue, the morphological and pathological changes were observed 
under a light microscope and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The impact 
of the simulated high-altitude environment on the rat testis tissue is obvious. 
Specifically, a decreased testicular organ index and altered indices of arterial 
blood gas and serum sex hormone levels caused testicular tissue morphological 
damage, reduced sperm quality, increased sperm deformity rate and altered 
malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase 
(GSH-Px) concentrations. The results demonstrate that L-carnitine can be 
administered as a preventive intervention to reduce the reproductive damage 
caused by high-altitude hypobaric and hypoxic environments and improve semen 
quality in a rat model.
