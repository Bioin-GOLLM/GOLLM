Ambulatory assessment (AA) covers a wide range of assessment methods to study 
people in their natural environment, including self-report, observational, and 
biological/physiological/behavioral. AA methods minimize retrospective biases 
while gathering ecologically valid data from patients' everyday life in real 
time or near real time. Here, we report on the major characteristics of AA, and 
we provide examples of applications of AA in clinical psychology (a) to 
investigate mechanisms and dynamics of symptoms, (b) to predict the future 
recurrence or onset of symptoms, (c) to monitor treatment effects, (d) to 
predict treatment success, (e) to prevent relapse, and (f) as interventions. In 
addition, we present and discuss the most pressing and compelling future AA 
applications: technological developments (the smartphone), improved ecological 
validity of laboratory results by combined lab-field studies, and investigating 
gene-environment interactions. We conclude with a discussion of acceptability, 
compliance, privacy, and ethical issues.
