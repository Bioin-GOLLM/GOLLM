Senecavirus A (SVA) is an oncolytic RNA virus, and it is the ideal oncolytic 
virus that can be genetically engineered for editing. However, there has not 
been much exploration into creating SVA viruses that carry antitumor genes to 
increase their oncolytic potential. The construction of SVA viruses carrying 
antitumor genes that enhance oncolytic potential has not been fully explored. In 
this study, a recombinant SVA-CH-01-2015 virus (p15A-SVA-clone) expressing the 
human p16INK4A protein, also known as cell cycle-dependent protein kinase 
inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), was successfully rescued and characterized. The 
recombinant virus, called SVA-p16, exhibited similar viral replication kinetics 
to the parent virus, was genetically stable, and demonstrated enhanced antitumor 
effects in Ishikawa cells. Additionally, another recombinant SVA virus carrying 
a reporter gene (iLOV), SVA-iLOV, was constructed and identified using the same 
construction method as an auxiliary validation. Collectively, this study 
successfully created a new recombinant virus, SVA-p16, that showed increased 
antitumor effects and could serve as a model for further exploring the antitumor 
potential of SVA as an oncolytic virus.
