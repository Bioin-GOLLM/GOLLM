BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Europeans, variants in the hydroxysteroid 17-beta 
dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) gene impact liver histology in metabolic-associated 
fatty liver disease (MAFLD). The impact of these variants in ethnic Chinese is 
unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential associations in 
Chinese patients.
METHODS: In total, 427 Han Chinese with biopsy-confirmed MAFLD were enrolled. 
Two single nucleotide polymorphisms in HSD17B13 were genotyped: rs72613567 and 
rs6531975. Logistic regression was used to test the association between the 
single nucleotide polymorphisms and liver histology.
RESULTS: In our cohort, the minor allele TA of the rs72613567 variant was 
related to an increased risk of fibrosis [odds ratio (OR): 2.93 (1.20-7.17), 
p=0.019 for the additive model; OR: 3.32 (1.39-7.91), p=0.007 for the recessive 
model], representing an inverse association as compared to the results from 
European cohorts. In contrast, we observed a protective effect on fibrosis for 
the minor A allele carriers of the HSD17B13 rs6531975 variant [OR: 0.48 
(0.24-0.98), p=0.043 for the additive model; OR: 0.62 (0.40-0.94), p=0.025 for 
the dominant model]. HSD17B13 variants were only associated with fibrosis but no 
other histological features. Furthermore, HSD17B13 rs6531975 modulated the 
effect of PNPLA3 rs738409 on hepatic steatosis.
CONCLUSIONS: HSD17B13 rs72613567 is a risk variant for fibrosis in a Han Chinese 
MAFLD population but with a different direction for allelic association to that 
seen in Europeans. These data exemplify the need for studying diverse 
populations in genetic studies in order to fine map genome-wide association 
studies signals.
