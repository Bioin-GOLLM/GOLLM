To extend the shelf life and retain bioactive proteins in milk, this study 
utilized microfiltration (MF) combined with ultrasonication to treat skim milk 
and investigated its efficiency in removing bacteria and retaining bioactive 
proteins compared with HTST pasteurization and microfiltration alone. Results 
showed that microfiltration combined with ultrasonication at 1296 J/mL could 
completely remove the bacteria in skim milk. Ultrasonication further extended 
the shelf life (4 °C) of microfiltered skim milk, which could reach at least 
40 days when MF was combined with ˃1296 J/mL ultrasonication. In addition, ELISA 
showed that HTST pasteurization significantly decreased the levels of IgG by 
~30%, IgA by ~ 50%, IgM by ~60%, and lactoferrin by ~40%, whereas the activity 
of the enzymes lactoperoxidase and xanthine oxidase were also decreased 
by ~ 20%. Compared with HTST, MF alone or combined with ultrasonication retained 
these bioactive proteins to a larger degree. On the other hand, proteomics 
indicated both damage to casein micelle and fat globule structures in milk when 
ultrasonication at >1296 J/mL was applied, as shown by increases in caseins and 
milk fat globular proteins. Simultaneously, this ultrasound intensity also 
decreased levels of bioactive proteins, such as complement factors. Taken 
together, this study provided new insights that may help to implement this novel 
combination of non-thermal technologies for the dairy industry aimed at 
improving milk quality and functionality.
