OBJECTIVE: To analyze the SPG3A coding sequence and clinical features in a 
family with dominantly inherited hereditary spastin paraplegia (HSP) 
characterized by incomplete genetic penetrance and genetic anticipation.
METHODS: Analysis of the SPG3A coding sequence, being sequence variations in 
SPG4/spastin (S44L and P45Q) and SPG6/nipa1([GCG]5-11) genes were performed for 
the proband, his affected son, his unaffected parents and unaffected brother. 
One hundred normal individuals were selected as controls.
RESULTS: SPG3A mutation V253I in the proband, his affected son, and 
unexpectedly, in his asymptomatic, 72 year old father was identified. No 
mutation at the same site was found in the other members of this family as well 
as the control.
CONCLUSION: Incomplete genetic penetrance due to SPG3A mutation V253I was 
observed in this family. This is the second report. Marked phenotype variation 
(genetic non-penetrance, adult versus childhood onset symptoms) between subjects 
with the same SPG3A mutation indicates the influence of modifying genetic or 
environmental factors. Progressively earlier symptom onset and increasing 
symptom severity in this family is consistent with genetic anticipation which 
has not been previously reported in SPG3A-HSP.
