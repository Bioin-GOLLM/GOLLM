Fully activated innate immune cells are required for effective responses to 
infection, but their prompt deactivation and removal are essential for limiting 
tissue damage. Here, we have identified a critical role for the prolyl 
hydroxylase enzyme Phd2 in maintaining the balance between appropriate, 
predominantly neutrophil-mediated pathogen clearance and resolution of the 
innate immune response. We demonstrate that myeloid-specific loss of Phd2 
resulted in an exaggerated inflammatory response to Streptococcus pneumonia, 
with increases in neutrophil motility, functional capacity, and survival. These 
enhanced neutrophil responses were dependent upon increases in glycolytic flux 
and glycogen stores. Systemic administration of a HIF-prolyl hydroxylase 
inhibitor replicated the Phd2-deficient phenotype of delayed inflammation 
resolution. Together, these data identify Phd2 as the dominant HIF-hydroxylase 
in neutrophils under normoxic conditions and link intrinsic regulation of 
glycolysis and glycogen stores to the resolution of neutrophil-mediated 
inflammatory responses. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of 
targeting metabolic pathways in the treatment of inflammatory disease.
