Prion disease has displayed large infection host ranges among several species; 
however, dogs have not been reported to be infected and are considered prion 
disease-resistant animals. Case-controlled studies in several species, including 
humans and cattle, indicated a potent association of prion protein gene (PRNP) 
polymorphisms in the progression of prion disease. Thus, because of the proximal 
location and similar structure of the PRNP gene among the prion gene family, the 
prion-like protein gene (PRND) was noted as a novel candidate gene that 
contributes to prion disease susceptibility. Several case-controlled studies 
have confirmed the relationship of the PRND gene with prion disease 
vulnerability, and strong genetic linkage disequilibrium blocks were identified 
in prion-susceptible species between the PRNP and PRND genes. However, to date, 
polymorphisms of the dog PRND gene have not been reported, and the genetic 
linkage between the PRNP and PRND genes has not been examined thus far. Here, we 
first investigated dog PRND polymorphisms in 207 dog DNA samples using direct 
DNA sequencing. A total of four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 
including one nonsynonymous SNP (c.149G>A, R50H), were identified in this study. 
We also found two major haplotypes among the four novel SNPs. In addition, we 
compared the genotype and allele frequencies of the c.149G>A (R50H) SNP and 
found significantly different distributions among eight dog breeds. Furthermore, 
we annotated the c.149G>A (R50H) SNP of the dog PRND gene using in silico tools, 
PolyPhen-2, PROVEAN, and PANTHER. Finally, we examined linkage disequilibrium 
between the PRNP and PRND genes in dogs. Interestingly, we did not find a strong 
genetic linkage between these two genes. To the best of our knowledge, this was 
the first genetic study of the PRND gene in a prion disease-resistant animal, a 
dog.
