We have studied the interaction of water with three important analgesics, 
aspirin, paracetamol and caffeine using DFT calculations and FTIR-ATR 
spectroscopy. In our study, water is used as a probe molecule to reveal the 
various H-bonding sites on the electrostatic potential energy surface of the 
analgesics. We find that water forms a strong double H-bond with the COOH group 
of aspirin and that the oxygen of the ester group can become H-bond acceptors. 
Paracetamol forms the strongest H-bond with water at the hydroxyl group and 
weaker H-bonds with the C = O group and the N-H group. Caffeine forms the 
strongest H-bond with water at the top C = O group and can form additional 
H-bonds with the bottom C = O group and the nitrogen of the imidazole ring. 
These studies may help to better understand the solvation of these analgesics in 
water.
