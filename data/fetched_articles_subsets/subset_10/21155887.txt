BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are two 
major phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that present with 
inflammation of the colon or the entire gastrointestinal tract, respectively. 
Genome-wide association studies have confirmed the role of nucleotide-binding 
oligomerization domain protein-2 (NOD2) variants and identified several other 
genes associated with IBD. We investigated whether variants in NOD2 and 
interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) are associated with IBD in a well-characterized 
case-control cohort from southern India.
METHODS: We recruited 652 patients (411 UC and 241 CD) using established 
diagnostic criteria and 442 age-, sex-, and ethnically-matched, normal 
individuals. By direct sequencing, we screened the complete NOD2 gene and 
genotyped the R381Q variant in IL23R, and performed an association analysis and 
genotype-phenotype correlation analysis.
RESULTS: The clinical presentation of UC and CD patients did not differ 
significantly from the Europeans. We observed a monomorphic status for three 
common disease-susceptible variants, R702W, G908R, and 1007fs in NOD2; three 
other single nucleotide polymorphisms, P268S, R459R, and R587R, had a comparable 
minor allele frequency in patients and controls. Compared to Europeans, we found 
a low frequency (∼1%) of the protective allele at R381Q in IL23R and no 
statistically-significant association with IBD (odds ratio = 0.87; 95% 
confidence interval = 0.26-2.86; P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that variants in the NOD2 gene and the 
protective variant R381Q in IL23R are not associated with IBD in Indians. 
Additional variants in these or other candidate genes might play a major role in 
the pathophysiology of IBD in Indians.
