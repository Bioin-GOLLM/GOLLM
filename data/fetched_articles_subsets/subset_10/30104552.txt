With the aging process, a loss of skeletal muscle mass and dysfunction related 
to metabolic syndrome is observed in older people. Yams are commonly use in 
functional foods and medications with various effects. The present study was 
conducted to investigate the effects of rhizome extract of Dioscorea batatas 
(Dioscoreae Rhizoma, Chinese yam) and its bioactive compound, allantoin, on 
myoblast differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle cells. 
Yams were extracted in water and allantoin was analyzed by high performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC). The expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and 
mitochondrial biogenesis-regulating factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), sirtuin-1 (Sirt-1), nuclear 
respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) and transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM), 
and the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA 
carboxylase (ACC) were determined in C2C12 myotubes by reverse transcriptase 
(RT)-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or western blot. The glucose levels and 
total ATP contents were measured by glucose consumption, glucose uptake and ATP 
assays, respectively. Treatment with yam extract (1 mg/mL) and allantoin (0.2 
and 0.5 mM) significantly increased MyHC expression compared with non-treated 
myotubes. Yam extract and allantoin significantly increased the expression of 
PGC-1α, Sirt-1, NRF-1 and TFAM, as well as the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC 
in C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, yam extract and allantoin significantly 
increased glucose uptake levels and ATP contents. Finally, HPLC analysis 
revealed that the yam water extract contained 1.53% of allantoin. Yam extract 
and allantoin stimulated myoblast differentiation into myotubes and increased 
energy production through the upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis 
regulators. These findings indicate that yam extract and allantoin can help to 
prevent skeletal muscle dysfunction through the stimulation of the energy 
metabolism.
