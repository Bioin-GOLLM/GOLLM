OBJECTIVE: To detect the gene mutation of a family with piebaldism.
METHODS: Diagnosis of a patient with piebaldism was constructed by pathology, 
ultrastructural examination and typical clinical-phenotype. Detection of gene 
mutation was carried out by PCR and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: G 2528A substitution transition in the KIT gene was found in the 
proband of the family with piebaldism. This mutation resulted in S850N 
substitution in protein product of KIT gene. No mutation was found in 100 normal 
individuals and other family members.
CONCLUSION: The mutation of S850N maybe one cause of clinical phenotype of the 
family with piebaldism.
