BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Choline is an essential nutrient involved in one-carbon 
metabolism, but its role in mechanisms underlying meiotic non-disjunction is 
poorly known. The relationship between folate-homocysteine metabolic pathway 
gene polymorphism and Down syndrome (DS) risk has been widely analyzed, but 
there are limited reports on its correlation with choline metabolism. In the 
present case-control association study, we investigated the relationship of 
three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (phosphatidylethanolamine 
N-methyltransferase (PEMT) rs12325817, choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) rs12676 and 
homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) rs3733890) of choline metabolism with risk 
for DS.
SUBJECT/METHODS: Genotyping of 228 mothers of a down syndrome child (DSM) and 
200 control mothers (CMs) for all SNPs was performed by PCR coupled with 
restriction fragment length polymorphism method.
RESULTS: A significantly increased risk for BHMT +742AA genotype with an odds 
ratio of 4.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.66-14.88, P=0.0036) was observed. 
For PEMT rs12325817 and CHDH rs12676, no significant difference in allelic and 
genotypic frequencies was observed. In genotypic combination analysis 
considering PEMT -744GG/CHDH +432GG/BHMT +742GG as the reference combination, 
PEMT -744GC/CHDH +432GG/BHMT +742GG genotypic combination was significantly 
higher in DSM compared with that in CMs with an odds ratio of 2.061 (95% CI: 
1.10-3.86, P=0.0342). We also observed an epistatic interaction between 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801133 and choline metabolic 
pathway gene variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate impaired choline metabolism showing a greater 
risk for DS, especially in a population associated with homocysteine-folate 
impairment. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.
