Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a genetic disorder characterized by 
oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding tendency and susceptibility to pulmonary 
fibrosis. No curative therapy is available. Genetic correction directed to the 
lungs, bone marrow and/or gastro-intestinal tract might provide alternative 
forms of treatment for the diseases multi-systemic complications. We demonstrate 
that lentiviral-mediated gene transfer corrects the expression and function of 
the HPS1 gene in patient dermal melanocytes, which opens the way to development 
of gene therapy for HPS.
