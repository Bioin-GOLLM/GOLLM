A fourth dose of a COVID-19 vaccine has been recommended by a number of 
authorities due to waning immunity over time and the emergence of 
immune-escaping variants. Here, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of 
the bivalent BV-01-B5 or V-01D-351 or the prototype V-01 for heterologous 
boosting in three-dose inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (ICV) recipients, in 
comparison with ICV homologous boosting. One pilot study (NCT05583357) included 
20 participants randomized at 1:1, either receiving V-01D-351 or CoronaVac. The 
other one (NCT05585567) recruited 36 participants randomized at 2:1, either 
receiving BV-01-B5 or V-01, respectively. BV-01-B5, V-01D-351, and V-01 were 
safe and well-tolerated as heterologous booster shots after three doses of ICV, 
with adverse reactions predominantly being mild and moderate in severity, 
similar to the safety profile of ICV boosters. The bivalent V-01D-351 and 
BV-01-B5 and prototype V-01 booster demonstrated remarkable cross-reactive 
immunogenicity against the prototype and multiple emerging variants of concern 
(VOCs), with the geometric mean ratio (versus CoronaVac) in particular being 
31.3 (500 vs. 16), 12.0 (192 vs. 16) and 8.5 (136 vs.16) against BA.4/5 14 days 
after the booster, respectively. Taken together, the modified 
bivalent-formulation V-01 boosters induced robust neutralizing responses against 
multiple Omicron sublineages, better than V-01 and remarkably superior to ICV 
booster, without compromising the safety and tolerability.
