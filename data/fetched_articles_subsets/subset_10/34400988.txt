Athletic ability is influenced by several exogenous and endogenous factors 
including genetic component. Hundreds of gene variants have been proposed as 
potential genetic markers associated with fitness-related phenotypes as well as 
elite-level athletic performance. Among others, variants within the PPARA gene 
that code for the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α are of potential 
interest. The main goal of the present study was to determine PPARA (G/C, 
rs4253778) genotype distribution among a group of Polish, Lithuanian and Italian 
international level male gymnasts and to compare our findings with those of 
previous research on the frequency of the PPARA intron 7 C allele/CC genotype in 
power/strength-oriented athletes. A total of 464 male subjects (147 gymnasts and 
317 controls) from Poland (n = 203), Italy (n = 146) and Lithuania (n = 107) 
participated in the study. No statistically significant differences were found 
in any of the analyzed cohorts. However, a significantly higher frequency of the 
CC genotype of the PPARA rs4253778 polymorphism was observed when all gymnasts 
were pooled and compared with pooled control using a recessive model of 
inheritance (OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.18-10, p = 0.022). It is important to know 
that we investigated a relatively small sample of male European gymnasts and our 
results are limited only to male participants. Thus, it is necessary to validate 
our results in larger cohorts of athletes of different ethnicities and also in 
female gymnasts to find out whether there is a gender effect.
