BACKGROUND: Models of isolated and perfused kidneys are used to study the 
effects of drugs, hazardous or toxic substances on renal functions. Since 
physiological and morphological parameters of small laboratory animal kidneys 
are difficult to compare to human renal parameters, porcine kidney perfusion 
models have been developed to simulate closer conditions to the human situation, 
but exact values of renal parameters for different collection and perfusion 
conditions have not been reported so far. If the organs could be used out of 
regular slaughtering processes animal experiments may be avoided.
METHODS: To assess renal perfusion quality, we analyzed different perfusion 
settings in a standardized model of porcine kidney hemoperfusion with organs 
collected in the operating theatre (OP: groups A-D) or in a public abattoir 
(SLA: group E) and compared the data to in vivo measurements in living animals 
(CON). Experimental groups had defined preservation periods (0, 2 and 24 hrs), 
one with additional albumin in the perfusate (C) for edema reduction.
RESULTS: Varying perfusion settings resulted in different functional values 
(mean +/- SD): blood flow (RBF [ml/min*100 g]: (A) 339.9 +/- 61.1; (C) 244.5 +/- 
53.5; (D) 92.8 +/- 25.8; (E) 153.8 +/- 41.5); glomerular filtration (GFR 
[ml/min*100 g]: (CON) 76.1 +/- 6.2; (A) 59.2 +/- 13.9; (C) 25.0 +/- 10.6; (D) 
1.6 +/- 1.3; (E) 16.3 +/- 8.2); fractional sodium reabsorption (RFNa [%] (CON) 
99.8 +/- 0.1; (A) 82.3 +/- 8.1; (C) 86.8 +/- 10.3; (D) 38.4 +/- 24.5; (E) 88.7 
+/- 5.8). Additionally the tubular coupling-ratio of 
Na-reabsorption/O2-consumption was determined (TNa/O2-cons [mmol-Na/mmol- O2] 
(CON) 30.1; (A) 42.0, (C) 80.6; (D) 17.4; (E) 23.8), exhibiting OP and SLA 
organs with comparable results.
CONCLUSION: In the present study functional values for isolated kidneys with 
different perfusion settings were determined to assess organ perfusion quality. 
It can be summarized that the hemoperfused porcine kidney can serve as a 
biological model with acceptable approximation to in vivo renal physiology, also 
if the organs originate from usual slaughtering processes.
