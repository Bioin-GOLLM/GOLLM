BACKGROUND: The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during pregnancy in double 
heterozygous carriers of factor (F) V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A is not 
established. Hence, whether or not these women deserve antithrombotic 
prophylaxis when pregnant is unknown.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the frame of a multicenter family study, 52 double 
heterozygous carriers of FV Leiden and prothrombin G20210A who had remained 
pregnant at least once before knowledge of thrombophilia, were retrospectively 
investigated with respect to the occurrence of first VTE during pregnancy and 
puerperium. They were compared with 104 heterozygous carriers of FV Leiden, 104 
of prothrombin G20210A and 104 women without thrombophilia.
RESULTS: Double heterozygotes were similar to single heterozygous carriers and 
non-carriers for the age at first pregnancy, age at testing and rate of 
full-term pregnancies. No VTE during pregnancy was observed in the four groups 
of women, whereas in the puerperium it occurred in two double carriers (1.8% of 
pregnancies, 95% CI: 0.5-6.3), three single FV Leiden carriers (1.5%, 0.5-4.3), 
two single prothrombin G20210A carriers (1%, 0.2-3.6) and one non-carrier (0.4%, 
0-2.5).
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of first VTE during pregnancy and puerperium in double 
heterozygous carriers of FV Leiden and prothrombin G20210A is low and similar to 
that of single carriers. As for single heterozygotes, antithrombotic prophylaxis 
in asymptomatic double heterozygous carriers appears to be justified only in 
puerperium.
