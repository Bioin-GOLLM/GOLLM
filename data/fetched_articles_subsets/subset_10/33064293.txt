BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have revealed that sulfation, as 
mediated by the estrogen-sulfating cytosolic sulfotransferase (SULT) SULT1E1, is 
involved in the metabolism of 17β-estradiol (E2), 4-hydroxytamoxifen 
(4OH-tamoxifen), and diethylstilbestrol in humans. It is an interesting question 
whether the genetic polymorphisms of SULT1E1, the gene that encodes the SULT1E1 
enzyme, may impact on the metabolism of E2 and these two drug compounds through 
sulfation.
METHODS: In this study, five missense coding single nucleotide polymorphisms of 
the SULT1E1 gene were selected to investigate the sulfating activity of the 
coded SULT1E1 allozymes toward E2, 4OH-tamoxifen, and diethylstilbestrol. 
Corresponding cDNAs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, and recombinant 
SULT1E1 allozymes were bacterially expressed, affinity-purified, and 
characterized using enzymatic assays.
RESULTS: Purified SULT1E1 allozymes were shown to display differential sulfating 
activities toward E2, 4OH-tamoxifen, and diethylstilbestrol. Kinetic analysis 
revealed further distinct Km (reflecting substrate affinity) and Vmax 
(reflecting catalytic activity) values of the five SULT1E1 allozymes with E2, 
4OH-tamoxifen, and diethylstilbestrol as substrates.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings highlighted the significant 
differences in E2-, as well as the drug-sulfating activities of SULT1E1 
allozymes, which may have implications in the differential metabolism of E2, 
4OH-tamoxifen, and diethylstilbestrol in individuals with different SULT1E1 
genotypes.
