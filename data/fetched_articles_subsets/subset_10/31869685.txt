Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from individual patient basis are 
considered a powerful resource to model human diseases. However, to study 
complex multigenic diseases such as Congenital Heart Disease, it is crucial to 
generate perfect isogenic controls to understand gene singularity and 
contribution. Here, we report the engendering of an isogenic hiPSC line with 
homozygous correction of c.455G > A alteration in the DAND5 gene, using 
CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The characterization of a clone of this cell line 
demonstrates normal karyotype, pluripotent state, and potential to differentiate 
in vitro towards endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm.
