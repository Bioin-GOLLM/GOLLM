Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient required for plant growth and crop 
production. However, N in soil is usually insufficient for plant growth. Thus, 
chemical N fertilizer has been extensively used to increase crop production. Due 
to negative effects of N rich fertilizer on the environment, improving N usage 
has been a major issue in the field of plant science to achieve sustainable 
production of crops. For that reason, many efforts have been made to elucidate 
how plants regulate N uptake and utilization according to their surrounding 
habitat over the last 30 years. Here, we provide recent advances focusing on 
regulation of N uptake, allocation of N by N transporting system, and signaling 
pathway controlling N responses in plants. [BMB Reports 2023; 56(2): 56-64].
