SNPs within CHRNA5-A3-B4 and CYP2A6/B6 are associated with smoking dependence 
but not with tobacco dependence treatment outcomes in the Czech population.

PURPOSE: Tobacco/nicotine dependence has a significant heritable component. 
Genome-wide association studies have associated the single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) rs578776, rs16969968, rs6474412, rs3733829 and rs4105144 
with nicotine dependence in Western European populations. We examined whether 
these SNPs influence nicotine dependence and successful treatment of tobacco 
dependence in the Czech middle-European population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Variants were analysed by PCR-RFLP or by TaqMan assay in 
807 adult heavy tobacco-dependent smokers - patients of the Centre for Treatment 
of Tobacco Dependence (Prague) as well as 1,362 self-reported non-smokers.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Except for rs3733829, association with tobacco 
dependence was confirmed for all other genetic variants. In agreement with 
previous studies, the strongest determinant of tobacco dependence was rs16969968 
with OR (95%CI) 1.32 (1.08-1.62) for A allele carriers vs. GG comparison 
(P=0.003). In contrast, none of the analysed variants reached significance with 
respect to a 1-year course of successful tobacco dependence treatment (all P 
over 0.18) in a subset of 525 patients.
CONCLUSION: We confirmed the association between variants within genes that code 
nicotinic-acetylcholine receptors (-A3, -A5 and -B3), CYP2A6/B6 and tobacco 
dependence development in the Czech population. The success of the tobacco 
dependence treatment was not influenced by the analysed SNPs.
