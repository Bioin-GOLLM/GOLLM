The self-renewal and differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is 
maintained by the regulated expression of core pluripotency factors. Expression 
levels of the core pluripotency factor Nanog are tightly regulated by a negative 
feedback autorepression loop. However, it remains unclear how ESCs perceive 
NANOG levels and execute autorepression. Here, we show that a dose-dependent 
induction of Fgfbp1 and Fgfr2 by NANOG activates autocrine-mediated ERK 
signaling in Nanog-high cells to trigger autorepression. pERK recruits NONO to 
the Nanog locus to repress transcription by preventing POL2 loading. This Nanog 
autorepression process establishes a self-perpetuating reciprocal NANOG-pERK 
regulatory circuit. We further demonstrate that this reciprocal regulatory 
circuit induces pERK heterogeneity and ERK signaling dynamics in pluripotent 
stem cells. Collectively our data suggest that NANOG induces Fgfr2 and Fgfbp1 to 
activate ERK signaling in Nanog-high cells to establish a NANOG-pERK reciprocal 
regulatory circuit. This circuit regulates ERK signaling dynamics and Nanog 
autoregulation in pluripotent cells.
