BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal barrier alterations are associated with fatty 
liver (FL) and metabolic syndrome (MetS), but microRNA (miR) signaling pathways 
in MetS-FL pathogenesis remain unclear. This study investigates an 
epithelial-focused miR network in colorectal cell models based on the previously 
reported MetS-FL miR trio of hsa-miR-142-3p, hsa-miR-18b, and hsa-miR-890.
METHODS: Each miR mimic construct of MetS-FL miR trio was transfected into human 
colorectal cells, CRL-1790 or Caco-2. Global miRNome changes posttransfection 
were profiled (nCounterÂ® Human v3 miRNA, NanoString Technologies). Changes in 
barrier (transepithelial electrical resistance, TEER) and epithelial cell 
junction structure (Occludin and Zona Occludens-1/ZO-1 immunofluorescence 
staining-confocal microscopy) were examined pre- and posttransfection in Caco-2 
cell monolayers. A signaling network was constructed from the MetS-FL miR trio, 
MetS-FL miR-induced colorectal miRNome changes, ZO-1, and Occludin.
RESULTS: Transfection of CRL-1790 cells with each MetS-FL miR mimic led to 
global changes in the cellular miRNome profile, with 288 miRs being altered in 
expression by more than twofold. Eleven miRs with known cytoskeletal and 
metabolic roles were commonly altered in expression by all three miR mimics. 
Transfection of Caco-2 cell monolayers with each MetS-FL miR mimic induced 
barrier-associated TEER variations and led to structural modifications of ZO-1 
and Occludin within epithelial cell junctions. Pathway analysis incorporating 
the MetS-FL miR trio, eleven common target miRs, ZO-1, and Occludin revealed a 
signaling network centered on TNF and AKT2, which highlights injury, 
inflammation, and hyperplasia.
CONCLUSIONS: Colon-specific changes in epithelial barriers, cell junction 
structure, and a miRNome signaling network are described from functional studies 
of a MetS-FL miR trio signature.
