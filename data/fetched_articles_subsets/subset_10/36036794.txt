BACKGROUND: Exposure to heavy metals has been reported to be associated with 
multiple diseases. However, direct associations and potential mechanisms of 
heavy metals with physical disability remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify associations of heavy metals with physical 
disability and further explore the potential mechanisms of DNA methylation on 
the genome scale.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 4,391 older adults was conducted and 
activities of daily living (ADL) disability were identified using a 14-item 
scale questionnaire including basic and instrumental activities to assess the 
presence of disability (yes or no) rated on a scale of dependence. Odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated to quantify associations 
between heavy metals and ADL disability prevalence using multivariate logistic 
regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models. Whole 
blood-derived DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylationEPIC 
BeadChip array. An ADL disability-related epigenome-wide DNA methylation 
association study (EWAS) was performed among 212 sex-matched ADL disability 
cases and controls, and mediation analysis was further applied to explore 
potential mediators of DNA methylation.
RESULTS: Each 1-standard deviation (SD) higher difference in log10-transformed 
manganese, copper, arsenic, and cadmium level was significantly associated with 
a 14% (95% CI: 1.05, 1.24), 16% (95% CI:1.07, 1.26), 22% (95% CI:1.13, 1.33), 
and 15% (95% CI:1.06, 1.26) higher odds of ADL disability, which remained 
significant in the multiple-metal and BKMR models. A total of 85 differential 
DNA methylation sites were identified to be associated with ADL disability 
prevalence, among which methylation level at cg220000984 and cg23012519 
(annotated to IRGM and PKP3) mediated 31.0% and 31.2% of manganese-associated 
ADL disability prevalence, cg06723863 (annotated to ESRP2) mediated 32.4% of 
copper-associated ADL disability prevalence, cg24433124 (nearest to IER3) 
mediated 15.8% of arsenic-associated ADL disability prevalence, and cg07905190 
and cg17485717 (annotated to FREM1 and TCP11L1) mediated 21.5% and 30.5% of 
cadmium-associated ADL disability prevalence (all p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggested that heavy metals contributed to higher 
prevalence of ADL disability and that locus-specific DNA methylation are partial 
mediators, providing potential biomarkers for further cellular mechanism 
studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10602.
