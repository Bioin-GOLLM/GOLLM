Metabolism is coordinated among tissues and organs via neuronal signals. Levels 
of circulating amino acids (AAs), which are elevated in obesity, activate the 
intracellular target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1)/S6kinase (S6K) pathway in 
the liver. Here we demonstrate that hepatic AA/mTORC1/S6K signalling modulates 
systemic lipid metabolism via a mechanism involving neuronal inter-tissue 
communication. Hepatic expression of an AA transporter, SNAT2, activates the 
mTORC1/S6K pathway, and markedly elevates serum triglycerides (TGs), while 
downregulating adipose lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Hepatic Rheb or active-S6K 
expression have similar metabolic effects, whereas hepatic expression of 
dominant-negative-S6K inhibits TG elevation in SNAT2 mice. Denervation, 
pharmacological deafferentation and Î²-blocker administration suppress 
obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia with adipose LPL upregulation, suggesting 
that signals are transduced between liver and adipose tissue via a neuronal 
pathway consisting of afferent vagal and efferent sympathetic nerves. Thus, the 
neuronal mechanism uncovered here serves to coordinate amino acid and lipid 
levels and contributes to the development of obesity-related 
hypertriglyceridemia.
