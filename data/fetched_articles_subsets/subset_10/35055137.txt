Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the leading causes of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide. mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) mutations are known to 
participate in the development and progression of some CVD. Moreover, specific 
types of mitochondria-mediated CVD have been discovered, such as MIEH 
(maternally inherited essential hypertension) and maternally inherited CHD 
(coronary heart disease). Maternally inherited mitochondrial CVD is caused by 
certain mutations in the mtDNA, which encode structural mitochondrial proteins 
and mitochondrial tRNA. In this review, we focus on recently identified mtDNA 
mutations associated with CVD (coronary artery disease and hypertension). 
Additionally, new data suggest the role of mtDNA mutations in Brugada syndrome 
and ischemic stroke, which before were considered only as a result of mutations 
in nuclear genes. Moreover, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of mtDNA 
involvement in the development of the disease.
