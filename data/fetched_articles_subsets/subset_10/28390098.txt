The preclinical models of pancreatic adenocarcinoma provide an alternative means 
for determining the mechanisms of malignancy and possibilities for treatments, 
thus representing a resource of immense potential for cancer treatment in 
medicine. To evaluate different tumor models, quantifiable magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) techniques can play a significant role in identifying valuable in 
vivo biomarkers of tumor characteristics. We characterized three models of 
pancreatic cancer with multiparametric MRI techniques. Tumor stromal density of 
each tumor was measured using diffusion-weighted imaging and magnetization 
transfer (MT-MRI). Histologic measurement showed a similar trend with tumor 
fibrosis levels. Results indicated that MRI measurements can serve as a valuable 
tool in identifying and evaluating tumor characteristics.
