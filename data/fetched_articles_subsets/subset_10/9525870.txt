The breast and ovarian cancer tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1, encodes for a 
Zn2+-binding RING finger motif located near the protein NH2 terminus. The RING 
finger motif is characterized by eight conserved Cys and His residues which form 
two Zn2+-binding sites termed Site I and Site II. We used limited proteolysis in 
conjunction with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass 
spectroscopy to investigate the metal binding properties and to probe the 
solution structures of wild-type and mutant BRCA1 constructs that include the 
RING finger. Our results show that the RING finger motif is part of a larger 
proteolysis-resistant structural domain which encompasses the first 110 residues 
of BRCA1. Analytical gel-filtration chromatography and chemical cross-linking 
experiments demonstrate that the BRCA1 NH2-terminal domain readily homodimerizes 
in solution. The cancer-predisposing C61G mutation, which alters a conserved 
Zn2+-binding residue, abolishes metal binding to Site II of the RING finger 
motif, while Site I remains intact and functional. The C61G mutation also 
results in increased proteolytic susceptibility of the COOH-terminal portion of 
the NH2-terminal domain and perturbs the oligomerization properties of BRCA1.
