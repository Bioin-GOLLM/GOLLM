A non-enveloped virus requires a membrane lesion to deliver its genome into a 
target cell1. For rotaviruses, membrane perforation is a principal function of 
the viral outer-layer protein, VP42,3. Here we describe theÂ use of electron 
cryomicroscopy to determine how VP4 performs this function and show that when 
activated by cleavage to VP8* and VP5*, VP4 can rearrange on the virion surface 
from an 'upright' to a 'reversed' conformation. The reversed structure projects 
a previously buried 'foot' domain outwards into the membrane of the host cell to 
which the virion has attached. Electron cryotomograms of virus particles 
entering cells are consistent with this picture. Using a disulfide mutant of 
VP4, we have also stabilized a probable intermediate in the transition between 
the two conformations. Our results define molecular mechanisms for the first 
steps of the penetration of rotaviruses into the membranes of target cells and 
suggest similarities with mechanisms postulated for other viruses.
