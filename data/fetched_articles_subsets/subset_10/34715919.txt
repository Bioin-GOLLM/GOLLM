Histone modification is an important form of epigenetic regulation. Thereinto, 
histone methylation is a critical determination of chromatin states, 
participating in multiple cellular processes. As a conserved histone methylation 
mark, histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) can mediate multiple 
transcriptional-related events, such as the regulation of transcriptional 
activity, transcription elongation, pre-mRNA alternative splicing, and RNA m6A 
methylation. Additionally, H3K36me3 also contributes to DNA damage repair. Given 
the crucial function of H3K36me3 in genome regulation, the roles of H3K36me3 and 
its sole methyltransferase SETD2 in pathogenesis, especially malignancies, have 
been emphasized in many studies, and it is conceivable that disruption of 
histone methylation regulatory network composed of "writer", "eraser", "reader", 
and the mutation of H3K36me3 codes have the capacity of powerfully modulating 
cancer initiation and development. Here we review H3K36me3-mediated biological 
processes and summarize the latest findings regarding its role in cancers. We 
highlight the significance of epigenetic combination therapies in cancers.
