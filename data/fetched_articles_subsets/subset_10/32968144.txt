Large-scale epigenomic projects have mapped hundreds of thousands of potential 
regulatory sites in the human genome, but only a small proportion of these 
elements are proximal to transcription start sites. It is believed that the 
majority of these sequences are remote promoter-activating genomic sites 
scattered within several hundreds of kilobases from their cognate promoters and 
referred to as enhancers. It is still unclear what principles, aside from 
relative closeness in the linear genome, determine which promoter(s) is 
controlled by a given enhancer; however, this understanding is of great 
fundamental and clinical relevance. In recent years, C-methods (chromosome 
conformation capture-based methods) have become a powerful tool for the 
identification of enhancer-promoter spatial contacts that, in most cases, 
reflect their functional link. Here, we describe a new hybridisation-based 
promoter Capture-C protocol that makes use of biotinylated dsDNA probes 
generated by PCR from a custom pool of long oligonucleotides. The described 
protocol allows high-resolution promoter interactome description, providing a 
flexible and cost-effective alternative to the existing promoter Capture-C 
modifications. Based on the obtained data, we propose several tips on probe 
design that could potentially improve the results of future experiments.
