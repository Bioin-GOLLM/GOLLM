Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Nef promotes p53 protein degradation to 
protect HIV-1 infected cells from p53 induced apoptosis. We found that Nef 
mediated p53 degradation is accomplished through ubiquitin proteasome pathway in 
an Mdm2-independent manner. By GST pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays, we 
have shown that Nef interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP in both Nef 
transfected HEK-293T cells and HIV-1 infected MOLT3 cells. The p53 
ubiquitination and degradation was found to be enhanced by Nef with E6AP but not 
by Nef with E6AP-C843A, a dominant negative E6AP mutant. We show that Nef binds 
with E6AP and promotes E6AP dependent p53 ubiquitination. Further, Nef inhibits 
apoptosis of p53 null H1299 cells after exogenous expression of p53 protein. The 
p53 dependent apoptosis of H1299 cells was further reduced after the expression 
of Nef with E6AP. However, Nef mediated reduction in p53 induced apoptosis of 
H1299 cells was restored when Nef was co-expressed with E6AP-C843A. Thus, Nef 
and E6AP co-operate to promote p53 ubiquitination and degradation in order to 
suppress p53 dependent apoptosis. CHME3 cells, which are a natural host of 
HIV-1, also show p53 ubiquitination and degradation by Nef and E6AP. These 
results establish that Nef induces p53 degradation via cellular E3 ligase E6AP 
to inhibit apoptosis during HIV-1 infection.
