BACKGROUND: Bacterial DNA has been repeatedly detected in atheromatous lesions 
of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Phylogenetic signatures in the 
atheroma lesions that are similar to those of bacterial biofilms on human 
barrier organs, including the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, raise the 
question of a defective barrier function in CHD. NOD2 plays a major role in 
defense against bacterial invasion. Genetic variation in the CARD15 gene, which 
encodes NOD2, was previously shown to result in a barrier defect that causes 
chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g. Crohn disease). In the present study, we 
investigated the possible involvement of NOD2/CARD15 in the pathology of CHD by 
i) analyzing the local expression of NOD2 in atherectomy versus healthy tissue 
(n = 5 each) using histochemical immunofluorescence and ii) by testing the three 
major functional CARD15 variants (R702W, G908R and 1007fs) for association with 
early-onset CHD in 900 German patients and 632 healthy controls.
RESULTS: In atherectomy tissue of CHD patients, NOD2 was detected in 
inflammatory cells at the luminal sides of the lesions. However, the allele and 
genotype frequencies of the three major CARD15 polymorphisms did not differ 
between CHD patients and controls.
CONCLUSION: The NOD2 up-regulation in atheroma lesions indicates an involvement 
of this protein in the pathology of CHD. Although NOD2 could be important in 
local immune response mechanisms, none of the analyzed CARD15 variants seem to 
play a significant role in the etiology of CHD.
