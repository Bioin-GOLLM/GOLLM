Covering up to December 2013. Oligosaccharide natural products target a wide 
spectrum of biological processes including disruption of cell wall biosynthesis, 
interference of bacterial translation, and inhibition of human Î±-amylase. 
Correspondingly, oligosaccharides possess the potential for development as 
treatments of such diverse diseases as bacterial infections and type II 
diabetes. Despite their potent and selective activities and potential clinical 
relevance, isolated bioactive secondary metabolic oligosaccharides are less 
prevalent than other classes of natural products and their biosynthesis has 
received comparatively less attention. This review highlights the unique modes 
of action and biosynthesis of four classes of bioactive oligosaccharides: the 
orthosomycins, moenomycins, saccharomicins, and acarviostatins.
