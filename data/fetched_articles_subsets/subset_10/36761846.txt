Species delimitation and species diagnosis must remain separate operations to 
avoid constructing taxonomies comprised of non-monophyletic species based on 
morphological similarity as opposed to phylogenetic propinquity. This is 
particularly true for highly specialized species such as the range-restricted 
upland taxa in the Cyrtodactylusbrevipalmatus group of Indochina where strong 
selection pressure for an arboreal lifestyle has contributed to morphologically 
similar but distantly related species. This in turn, has resulted in a history 
of erroneous taxonomies that have actually obscured rather than revealed the 
diversity within this group. A Bayesian phylogeny of the C.brevipalmatus group 
recovered at least 15 putative species-level lineages, at least seven of which 
are undescribed, and of which four are described herein. A total evidence 
morphological data set comprised of 16 normalized morphometric, 15 meristic, and 
seven categorical characters scored across 51 individuals was subjected to a 
multiple factor analysis (MFA) and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to diagnose 
the putative species. These new species descriptions contribute to focusing 
attention to the unrealized diversity in upland tropical ecosystems, which due 
to climate change, are some of the most impearled ecosystems on the planet. 
Thus, it is paramount that taxonomies do not conflate species identities and 
underrepresent true diversity.
