INTRODUCTION: There is strong evidence that both genetic and environmental 
factors may affect the periodontal clinical status. However, epidemiological 
evidence on the association between Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) polymorphisms and 
Chronic Periodontitis (CP) has been inconsistent.
AIM: The focus of this study was to identify if a possible association between 
VDR Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) may be implicated in the 
aetiopathogenesis of CP in Colombian population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and ten CP patients and 50 Healthy Controls 
(HC) were recruited. Periodontal status was assessed based on probing depth, 
clinical attachment level, extent, and severity of periodontal breakdown. The 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was 
used to identify the VDR rs7975232, rs1544410, rs2228570, and rs731236 SNPs from 
saliva samples. Odds Ratios (ORs) along with their 95% Confidence Intervals 
(CIs) were computed to compare the distribution of genotypes/alleles between HC 
and CP patients, alongside with analysis of Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) and 
haplotype associations between SNPs. Also, an analysis of the interaction 
between genetic findings and those significant demographic factors was performed 
for all SNPs.
RESULTS: There was no association neither between the different genotypes/allele 
frequencies nor haplotypes and CP. Similarly, no significant differences in 
extent or severity amongst genotype/allele groups were observed. Even so, 
interaction analysis revealed significant synergistic interactions between each 
SNP and age associated with the disease status.
CONCLUSION: Although these results do not support that VDR SNPs could be 
identified as independent risk predictor variables for CP in the Colombian 
population, synergistic biological interactive effects of all these SNPs related 
to age might play a significant role in the pathogenic pathways of CP.
