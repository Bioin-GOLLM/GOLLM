Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) represent the most promising clinical source for 
regenerative medicine. However, given the cellular heterogeneity within 
cultivation and safety concerns, the development of specific and efficient tools 
to isolate a pure population and eliminate all residual undifferentiated PSCs 
from differentiated derivatives is a prerequisite for clinical applications. In 
this study, we raised a monoclonal antibody and identified its target antigen as 
desmoglein-2 (DSG2). DSG2 co-localized with human PSC (hPSC)-specific cell 
surface markers, and its expression was rapidly downregulated upon 
differentiation. The depletion of DSG2 markedly decreased hPSC proliferation and 
pluripotency marker expression. In addition, DSG2-negative population in hPSCs 
exhibited a notable suppression in embryonic body and teratoma formation. The 
actions of DSG2 in regulating the self-renewal and pluripotency of hPSCs were 
predominantly exerted through the regulation of β-catenin/Slug-mediated 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our results demonstrate that DSG2 is a 
valuable PSC surface marker that is essential for the maintenance of PSC 
self-renewal.
