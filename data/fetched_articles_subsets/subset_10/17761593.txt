Selective luteinizing hormone deficiency due to mutations in the luteinizing 
hormone beta-subunit gene (LHB) is a rare cause of hypogonadism. We describe the 
clinical features of a consanguineous family in which three siblings, two men 
and one woman, had hypogonadism related to isolated luteinizing hormone 
deficiency. These subjects have a newly discovered homozygous mutation of a 5' 
splice site in LHB: IVS2+1G-->C. This mutation disrupts the splicing of 
messenger RNA (mRNA), generating a gross abnormality in the processing of the 
luteinizing hormone beta-subunit mRNA, which abrogates the secretion of 
luteinizing hormone. We also determined that the female phenotype of this LHB 
mutation is characterized by normal pubertal development, secondary amenorrhea, 
and infertility.
