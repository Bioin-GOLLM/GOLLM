Acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) is one of several enzymes that generate the key 
metabolic intermediate, acetyl-CoA. In microbes and mammals ACS activity is 
regulated by the post-translational acetylation of a key lysine residue. ACS in 
plant cells is part of a two-enzyme system that maintains acetate homeostasis, 
but its post-translational regulation is unknown. This study demonstrates that 
the plant ACS activity can be regulated by the acetylation of a specific lysine 
residue that is positioned in a homologous position as the microbial and 
mammalian ACS sequences that regulates ACS activity, occurring in the middle of 
a conserved motif, near the carboxyl-end of the protein. The inhibitory effect 
of the acetylation of residue Lys-622 of the Arabidopsis ACS was demonstrated by 
site-directed mutagenesis of this residue, including its genetic substitution 
with the non-canonical N-ε-acetyl-lysine residue. This latter modification 
lowered the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme by a factor of more than 
500-fold. Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of the mutant enzyme indicates that 
this acetylation affects the first half-reaction of the ACS catalyzed reaction, 
namely, the formation of the acetyl adenylate enzyme intermediate. The 
post-translational acetylation of the plant ACS could affect acetate flux in the 
plastids and overall acetate homeostasis.
