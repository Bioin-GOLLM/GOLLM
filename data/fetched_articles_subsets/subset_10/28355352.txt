Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 
disease characterized by frequent infections, hypopigmentation, progressive 
neurologic deterioration and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), known as 
the accelerated phase. There is little experience in the accelerated phase of 
CHS treatment worldwide. Here, we present a case of a 9-month-old boy with 
continuous high fever, hypopigmentation of the skin, enlarged lymph nodes, 
hepatosplenomegaly and lung infection. He was diagnosed with CHS by gene 
sequencing, and had entered the accelerated phase. After 8 weeks of therapy, the 
boy had remission and was prepared for allogenic stem cell transplantation.
