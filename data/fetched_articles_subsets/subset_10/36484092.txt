DrugCentral monitors new drug approvals and standardizes drug information. The 
current update contains 285 drugs (131 for human use). New additions include: 
(i) the integration of veterinary drugs (154 for animal use only), (ii) the 
addition of 66 documented off-label uses and iii) the identification of adverse 
drug events from pharmacovigilance data for pediatric and geriatric patients. 
Additional enhancements include chemical substructure searching using SMILES and 
'Target Cards' based on UniProt accession codes. Statistics of interests include 
the following: (i) 60% of the covered drugs are on-market drugs with expired 
patent and exclusivity coverage, 17% are off-market, and 23% are on-market drugs 
with active patents and exclusivity coverage; (ii) 59% of the drugs are oral, 
33% are parenteral and 18% topical, at the level of the active ingredients; 
(iii) only 3% of all drugs are for animal use only; however, 61% of the 
veterinary drugs are also approved for human use; (iv) dogs, cats and horses are 
by far the most represented target species for veterinary drugs; (v) the 
physicochemical property profile of animal drugs is very similar to that of 
human drugs. Use cases include azaperone, the only sedative approved for swine, 
and ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor.
