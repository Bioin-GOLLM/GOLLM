OBJECTIVES: There are controversial results regarding the effect of the 
interaction of CETP polymorphisms with dietary fats on the lipid profiles. The 
aim of this study was to examine the effect of CETP polymorphisms (rs5882 and 
rs3764261) and macronutrient intakes interaction in relation to metabolic 
syndrome (MetS) or its components.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this nested case-control study, subjects were selected 
from among participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. Cases (n=441) 
were individually matched with two controls (844 non-MetS subjects). DNA samples 
were genotyped with HumanOmniExpress-24-v1-0 bead chips, including 649,932 SNP 
loci.
RESULTS: The mean ages at baseline were 38.1±10 and 37.0±10 years in women and 
36.2±11 and 36.3±11 years in men, respectively in cases and controls. We did not 
find significant gene-diet interactions between rs5882 and dietary macronutrient 
intakes in relation to MetS risk. The risk of low HDL-C was lower in the first 
quartile of MUFA and total fat intake in G allele carriers, compared to AA 
genotype group. The risk of high BP appeared to increase significantly in higher 
quartiles of trans-fatty acid intakes (>1.81% of total energy intake) in G 
allele carriers compared with the AA genotype group. No significant interactions 
were found between rs3764261 and macronutrient intakes in association with MetS 
or its components.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that dietary fats modify the association of 
rs5882 and risk of low HDL-C and high blood pressure.
