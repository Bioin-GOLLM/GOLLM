Changes in oscillatory activity are widely reported after subanesthetic 
ketamine, however their mechanisms of generation are unclear. Here, we tested 
the hypothesis that nasal respiration underlies the emergence of high-frequency 
oscillations (130-180 Hz, HFO) and behavioral activation after ketamine in 
freely moving rats. We found ketamine 20 mg/kg provoked "fast" theta sniffing in 
rodents which correlated with increased locomotor activity and HFO power in the 
OB. Bursts of ketamine-dependent HFO were coupled to "fast" theta frequency 
sniffing. Theta coupling of HFO bursts were also found in the prefrontal cortex 
and ventral striatum which, although of smaller amplitude, were coherent with OB 
activity. Haloperidol 1 mg/kg pretreatment prevented ketamine-dependent 
increases in fast sniffing and instead HFO coupling to slower basal respiration. 
Consistent with ketamine-dependent HFO being driven by nasal respiration, 
unilateral naris blockade led to an ipsilateral reduction in ketamine-dependent 
HFO power compared to the control side. Bilateral nares blockade reduced 
ketamine-induced hyperactivity and HFO power and frequency. These findings 
suggest that nasal airflow entrains ketamine-dependent HFO in diverse brain 
regions, and that the OB plays an important role in the broadcast of this 
rhythm.
