We analyzed the oxygen (O2) and carbon monoxide (CO) binding properties, 
autoxidation reaction rate, and FeO2 and FeCO vibrational frequencies of the 
H64Q mutant of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) reconstituted with chemically modified 
heme cofactors possessing a variety of heme Fe electron densities (ρ(Fe)), and 
the results were compared with those for the previously studied native [Shibata, 
T. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 6091-6098], and H64L [Nishimura, R. et 
al. Inorg. Chem. 2014, 53, 1091-1099], and L29F [Nishimura, R. et al. Inorg. 
Chem. 2014, 53, 9156-9165] mutants in order to elucidate the effect of changes 
in the heme electronic structure and distal polar interaction contributing to 
stabilization of the Fe-bound ligand on the functional and vibrational 
properties of the protein. The study revealed that, as in the cases of the 
previously studied native protein [Shibata, T. et al. Inorg. Chem. 2012, 51, 
11955-11960], the O2 affinity and autoxidation reaction rate of the H64Q mutant 
decreased with a decrease in ρ(Fe), as expected from the effect of a change in 
ρ(Fe) on the resonance between the Fe(2+)-O2 bond and Fe(3+)-O2(-)-like species 
in the O2 form, while the CO affinity of the protein is independent of a change 
in ρ(Fe). We also found that the well-known inverse correlation between the 
frequencies of Fe-bound CO (ν(CO)) and Fe-C (ν(FeC)) stretching [Li, X.-Y.; 
Spiro, T. G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988, 110, 6024-6033] is affected differently by 
changes in ρ(Fe) and the distal polar interaction, indicating that the effects 
of the two electronic perturbations due to the chemical modification of a heme 
cofactor and the replacement of nearby amino acid residues on the resonance 
between the two alternative canonical forms of the FeCO fragment in the protein 
are slightly different from each other. These findings provide a new insight for 
deeper understanding of the functional regulation of the protein.
