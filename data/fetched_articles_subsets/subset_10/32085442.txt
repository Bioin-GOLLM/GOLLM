In Arabidopsis thaliana, LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASEs (LACSs) catalyze the 
synthesis of long-chain acyl-CoAs and function in diverse biological processes. 
We have recently revealed that LACS2 is primarily involved in the production of 
polyunsaturated linolenoyl-CoA, essential for the activation of ethylene 
response transcription factors-mediated hypoxia signaling. Here, we further 
reported the dual role of LACS2 in the regulation of submergence tolerance by 
modulating cuticle permeability in Arabidopsis cells. LACS2-overexpressors 
(LACS2-OEs) showed improved tolerance to submergence, with higher accumulation 
of cuticular wax and cutin in their rosettes. In contrast, knockout of LACS2 in 
the lacs2-3 mutant resulted in hypersensitivity to submergence with reduced wax 
crystals and thinner cutin layer. By analyses of plant surface permeability, we 
observed that the hypoxic sensitivities in the LACS2-OEs and lacs2-3 mutant were 
physiologically correlated with chlorophyll leaching, water loss rates, ionic 
leakage, and gas exchange. Thus, our findings suggest the role of LACS2 in plant 
response to submergence by modulating cuticle permeability in plant cells.
