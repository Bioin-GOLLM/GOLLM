Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) is a key regulator of monocyte/macrophage 
differentiation that sustains the protumorigenic functions of tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs). We show that CSF1 is expressed in human melanoma, and 
patients with metastatic melanoma have increased CSF1 in blood compared to 
healthy subjects. In tumors, CSF1 expression correlated with the abundance of 
CD8+ T cells and CD163+ TAMs. Human melanoma cell lines consistently produced 
CSF1 after exposure to melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells or T cell-derived 
cytokines in vitro, reflecting a broadly conserved mechanism of CSF1 induction 
by activated CD8+ T cells. Mining of publicly available transcriptomic data sets 
suggested co-enrichment of CD8+ T cells with CSF1 or various TAM-specific 
markers in human melanoma, which was associated with nonresponsiveness to 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) checkpoint blockade in a smaller patient 
cohort. Combination of anti-PD1 and anti-CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) antibodies 
induced the regression of BRAFV600E -driven, transplant mouse melanomas, a 
result that was dependent on the effective elimination of TAMs. Collectively, 
these data implicate CSF1 induction as a CD8+ T cell-dependent adaptive 
resistance mechanism and show that simultaneous CSF1R targeting may be 
beneficial in melanomas refractory to immune checkpoint blockade and, possibly, 
other T cell-based therapies.
