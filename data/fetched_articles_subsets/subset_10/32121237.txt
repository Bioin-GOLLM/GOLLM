Applying electrical stimulation (ES) could affect different cellular mechanisms, 
thereby producing a bactericidal effect and an increase in human cell viability. 
Despite its relevance, this bioelectric effect has been barely reported in 
percolated conductive biopolymers. In this context, electroactive 
polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with conductive Thermally Reduced Graphene 
Oxide (TrGO) nanoparticles were obtained by a 3D printing method. Under direct 
current (DC) along the percolated scaffolds, a strong antibacterial effect was 
observed, which completely eradicated S. aureus on the surface of scaffolds. 
Notably, the same ES regime also produced a four-fold increase in the viability 
of human mesenchymal stem cells attached to the 3D conductive PCL/TrGO scaffold 
compared with the pure PCL scaffold. These results have widened the design of 
novel electroactive composite polymers that could both eliminate the bacteria 
adhered to the scaffold and increase human cell viability, which have great 
potential in tissue engineering applications.
