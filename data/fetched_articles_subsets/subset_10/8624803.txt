IL-4 causes hematopoietic cells to proliferate and express a series of genes, 
including CD23. We examined whether IL-4-mediated growth, as measured by 4PS 
phosphorylation, and gene induction were similarly controlled. Studies of 
M12.4.1 cells expressing human IL-4R truncation mutants indicated that the 
region between amino acids 557-657 is necessary for full gene expression, which 
correlated with Stat6 DNA binding activity. This region was not required for 4PS 
phosphorylation. Tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutations in the interval between 
amino acids 557-657 revealed that as long as one tyrosine remained unmutated, 
CD23 was fully induced. When all three tyrosines were mutated, the receptor was 
unable to induce CD23. The results indicate that growth regulation and gene 
expression are principally controlled by distinct regions of IL-4R.
