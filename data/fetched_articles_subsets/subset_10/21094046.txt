Finasteride and epristeride both inhibit 5α-reductase with high potency via 
competitive and non-competitive mechanism, respectively. A new hybrid of 
finasteride and epristeride was designed as a new 5α-reductase inhibitor based 
on combination principles in medicinal chemistry. Human 5β-reductase was chosen 
as a plausible surrogate of 5α-reductase type II and the results indicate that 
although the hybrid compound possesses the main bulk of epristeride, its 
inhibitory mechanism is same as of finasteride. The hybrid turned out to be a 
potent 5α-reductase inhibitor in low IC(50) ranges.
