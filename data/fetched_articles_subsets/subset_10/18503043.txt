Although organelle movement in higher plants is predominantly actin-based, 
potential roles for the 17 predicted Arabidopsis myosins in motility are only 
just emerging. It is shown here that two Arabidopsis myosins from class XI, XIE, 
and XIK, are involved in Golgi, peroxisome, and mitochondrial movement. 
Expression of dominant negative forms of the myosin lacking the actin binding 
domain at the amino terminus perturb organelle motility, but do not completely 
inhibit movement. Latrunculin B, an actin destabilizing drug, inhibits organelle 
movement to a greater extent compared to the effects of AtXIE-T/XIK-T 
expression. Amino terminal YFP fusions to XIE-T and XIK-T are dispersed 
throughout the cytosol and do not completely decorate the organelles whose 
motility they affect. XIE-T and XIK-T do not affect the global actin 
architecture, but their movement and location is actin-dependent. The potential 
role of these truncated myosins as genetically encoded inhibitors of organelle 
movement is discussed.
