Despite the substantial improvement in diagnosis and treatment within the last 
decades, ischemic stroke still represents a challenge, responsible still for a 
high burden of morbidity and mortality. Among the unmet clinical needs are the 
difficulties in identifying those subjects with the greatest risk of developing 
a stroke, the challenges in obtaining a timely diagnosis, the prompt recognition 
of the different clinical forms of stroke, the assessment of the response to 
treatments and the prognostic assessment. All these issues might be improved 
with appropriate smart biomarkers that could better inform clinical management. 
The present article offers an overview of the potential role of circular RNAs as 
disease biomarkers in stroke. A systematic approach was adopted to gather all 
potentially relevant information in order to provide a panoramic view on this 
class of promising molecules.
