BACKGROUND: Opioid abuse in chronic pain patients is a major public health 
issue, with rapidly increasing addiction rates and deaths from unintentional 
overdose more than quadrupling since 1999.
PURPOSE: This study seeks to determine the predictability of aberrant behavior 
to opioids using a comprehensive scoring algorithm incorporating phenotypic risk 
factors and neuroscience-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Proove Opioid Risk (POR) algorithm determines the 
predictability of aberrant behavior to opioids using a comprehensive scoring 
algorithm incorporating phenotypic risk factors and neuroscience-associated 
SNPs. In a validation study with 258 subjects with diagnosed opioid use disorder 
(OUD) and 650 controls who reported using opioids, the POR successfully 
categorized patients at high and moderate risks of opioid misuse or abuse with 
95.7% sensitivity. Regardless of changes in the prevalence of opioid misuse or 
abuse, the sensitivity of POR remained >95%.
CONCLUSION: The POR correctly stratifies patients into low-, moderate-, and 
high-risk categories to appropriately identify patients at need for additional 
guidance, monitoring, or treatment changes.
