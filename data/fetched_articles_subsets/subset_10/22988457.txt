Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused 
by Mycobacterium leprae, a microorganism that has a predilection for the skin 
and nerves. The disease is clinically characterized by one or more of the three 
cardinal signs: hypopigmented or erythematous skin patches with definite loss of 
sensation, thickened peripheral nerves, and acid-fast bacilli detected on skin 
smears or biopsy material. M. leprae primarily infects Schwann cells in the 
peripheral nerves leading to nerve damage and the development of disabilities. 
Despite reduced prevalence of M. leprae infection in the endemic countries 
following implementation of multidrug therapy (MDT) program by WHO to treat 
leprosy, new case detection rates are still high-indicating active transmission. 
The susceptibility to the mycobacteria and the clinical course of the disease 
are attributed to the host immune response, which heralds the review of 
immunopathology of this complex disease.
