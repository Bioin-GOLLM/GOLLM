In a 60-year-old woman with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) and 
Sertoli cell tumor, a germline mutation (A870E) in exon 8 of the androgen 
receptor (AR) gene could be detected. A sister of the patient was also affected 
by CAIS and developed a Sertoli cell tumor at age 56. The mutation has not been 
described so far and could be seen in a causal relationship with the development 
of this tumor.
