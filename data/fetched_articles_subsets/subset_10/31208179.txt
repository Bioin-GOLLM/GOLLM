OBJECTIVE: Puerarin has the potential of regulating the differentiation of 
preadipocytes, but its mechanism of action has not yet been elucidated. 
Adipocytes found in adipose tissue, the main endocrine organ, are the main sites 
of lipid deposition, and are widely used as a cell model in the study of in 
vitro fat deposition. This study aimed to investigate the effects of puerarin on 
adipogenesis in vitro.
METHODS: Puerarin was added to the culture medium during the process of 
adipogenesis. The proliferation and differentiation of bovine preadipocytes was 
measured through cell viability and staining with Oil Red O. The content of 
triacylglycerol (TG) was measured using a triglyceride assay kit. The mRNA and 
protein expression levels of adipogenic genes, peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor-γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα), were measured 
using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western 
blotting, respectively.
RESULTS: The addition of puerarin significantly increased adipogenesis of bovine 
preadipocytes and enhanced the mRNA and protein level expression of PPARγ 
(p&amp;lt;0.01). The expression of P-Akt increased after adipogenic hormonal 
induction, whereas puerarin significantly increased PPARγ expression by 
promoting the Akt signaling component, P-Akt. The mechanism of adipogenesis was 
found to be related to the phosphorylation level of Ser473, which may activate 
the downstream signaling of the Akt pathway.
CONCLUSION: Puerarin was able to promote the differentiation of preadipocytes 
and improve fat deposition in cattle. The mechanism of adipogenesis was found to 
be related to the phosphorylation level of Ser473.
