While advances in the treatment of pediatric cancers have improved survival to > 
80% across all tumor types, drug resistance continues to limit survival for a 
considerable number of patients. We review the known mechanisms of resistance in 
pediatric cancers, including processes that impair conventional chemotherapies, 
newer classes of targeted small molecule antineoplastic drugs, and monoclonal 
antibodies. We highlight similarities and differences in treatment approach and 
resistance between pediatric and adult cancers. We also discuss newer areas of 
research into drug resistance, including extracellular and immune factors.
