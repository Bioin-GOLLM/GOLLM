As potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) 
are involved in the tumorigenesis of various tumors. Genetic variation in long 
noncoding regions can lead to lncRNA dysfunction and even cancer. Nevertheless, 
studies on the association between lncRNA-associated single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC) remain inadequate. Here, we aimed to explore the association between 
SNPs in LINC01614 and HNSCC risk, and the potential role of LINC01614 in 
tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that rs16854802 A > G (odds ratio 
[OR] = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22-1.77, p < 0.001) and rs3113503 
G > C (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.15-1.64, p < 0.001) in LINC01614 increased the risk 
of HNSCC in the Chinese population. Functional bioinformatic analysis and 
luciferase reporter assay revealed that rs3113503 G > C variant disrupted the 
binding of miRNA-616-3p to LINC01614, which resulted in the increased expression 
of LINC01614. Further analysis of the TCGA database demonstrated that the 
upregulated LINC01614 in HNSCC cancer tissues was associated with poor 
prognostic in HNSCC patients. In vitro experiments showed that knockdown of 
LINC01614 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration ability of HNSCC 
cells. Mechanistically, allele C of rs3113503 in LINC01614 was more effective 
than allele G in activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, the 
reduced expression of LINC01614 also inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathway. In summary, our findings revealed that the risk SNP rs3113503 
G > C in LINC01614 altered the binding to miR-616-3p, which led to increased 
LINC01614 expression and promoted HNSCC progression by activating the PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathway.
