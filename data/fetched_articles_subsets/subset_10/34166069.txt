Vascular malformations, affecting â‰ˆ1% to 1.5% of the population, comprise a 
spectrum of developmental patterning defects of capillaries, arteries, veins, 
and/or lymphatics. The majority of vascular malformations occur sporadically; 
however, inherited malformations exist as a part of complex congenital diseases. 
The malformations, ranging from birthmarks to life-threatening conditions, are 
present at birth, but may reveal signs and symptoms-including pain, bleeding, 
disfigurement, and functional defects of vital organs-in infancy, childhood, or 
adulthood. Vascular malformations often exhibit recurrent patterns at affected 
sites due to the lack of curative treatments. This review series provides a 
state-of-the-art assessment of vascular malformation research at basic, 
clinical, genetic, and translational levels.
