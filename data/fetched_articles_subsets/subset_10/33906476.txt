AIMS: Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is one of the most common craniofacial 
anomalies, causing significant functional and psychological burden to the 
patients. This study aimed to identify the genetic cause of VWS in a Chinese 
family.
METHODS: Whole genome sequencingÂ (WGS) was performed to screen for pathogenic 
mutations. Various Bioinformatics tools were used to assess the pathogenicity of 
the variants. Cosegregation analysis of the candidate variant was carried out. 
Interpretation of variants was performed according to the American College of 
Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines.
RESULTS: A novel frameshift duplication c.373_374dupAA (p.Asn125Lys fs*43) was 
identified in exon 4 of the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene in all 3 
affected members, which were not found in unaffected family members. The novel 
mutation leads to a frameshift and a premature stop codon which caused putative 
truncated protein. Protein alignment indicated high evolutionary conservation of 
the p.N125 residue, and this mutation was predicted by online tools to be 
damaging and deleterious.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the novel mutation c.373_374dupAA 
(p.Asn125Lysfs*43) in the IRF6 gene corresponds to the VWS in this family. The 
discovery of this pathogenic variant enriches the genotypic spectrum of IRF6 
gene and contributes to genetic diagnosis and counseling of families with VWS.
