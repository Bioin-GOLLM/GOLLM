BACKGROUND: The Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling pathway is known to 
influence pathophysiological processes within the brain and the synthetic S1P 
analog FTY720 has been shown to provide neuroprotection in experimental models 
of acute stroke. However, the effects of a manipulation of S1P signaling at 
later time points after experimental stroke have not yet been investigated. We 
examined whether a relatively late initiation of a FTY720 treatment has a 
positive effect on long-term neurological outcome with a focus on reactive 
astrogliosis, synapses and neurotrophic factors.
METHODS: We induced photothrombotic stroke (PT) in adult C57BL/6J mice and 
allowed them to recover for three days. Starting on post-stroke day 3, mice were 
treated with FTY720 (1 mg/kg b.i.d.) for 5 days. Behavioral outcome was observed 
until day 31 after photothrombosis and periinfarct cortical tissue was analyzed 
using tandem mass-spectrometry, TaqMan®analysis and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: FTY720 treatment results in a significantly better functional outcome 
persisting up to day 31 after PT. This is accompanied by a significant decrease 
in reactive astrogliosis and larger post-synaptic densities as well as changes 
in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor α (VEGF α). Within the 
periinfarct cortex, S1P is significantly increased compared to healthy brain 
tissue.
CONCLUSION: Besides its known neuroprotective effects in the acute phase of 
experimental stroke, the initiation of FTY720 treatment in the convalescence 
period has a positive impact on long-term functional outcome, probably mediated 
through reduced astrogliosis, a modulation in synaptic morphology and an 
increased expression of neurotrophic factors.
