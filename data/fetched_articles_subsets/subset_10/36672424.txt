Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) express anti-tumoral activity 
mainly by blocking cyclooxygenase-2 involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins. 
Therefore, in the last few decades, many have attempted to explore the 
possibilities of applying this group of drugs as effective agents for the 
inhibition of neoplastic processes. This review summarizes the evidence 
presented in the literature regarding the anti-tumoral actions of NSAIDs used as 
monotherapies as well as in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics and 
natural products. In several clinical trials, it was proven that combinations of 
NSAIDs and chemotherapeutic drugs (CTDs) were able to obtain suitable results. 
The combination with phospholipids may resolve the adverse effects of NSAIDs and 
deliver derivatives with increased antitumor activity, whereas hybrids with 
terpenoids exhibit superior activity against their parent drugs or physical 
mixtures. Therefore, the application of NSAIDs in cancer therapy seems to be 
still an open chapter and requires deep and careful evaluation. The literature's 
data indicate the possibilities of re-purposing anti-inflammatory drugs 
currently approved for cancer treatments.
