Cerebral microbleeds (CMB) might reflect specific underlying vascular 
pathologies like cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). In the present study we 
report the gradient-echo MRI pattern of two siblings with P284S PSEN1 mutation. 
T2* gradient-echo images of the two subjects demonstrated multiple microbleeds 
in lobar regions. The role and causes of CMB in sporadic Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) patients have not been clearly established and useful contributions could 
derive from familial AD studies. Furthermore, since CAA is a potential risk 
factor for developing adverse events in AD immunization trials, the 
identification in vivo of CAA through non-invasive MRI methods could be useful 
to monitoring side effects.
