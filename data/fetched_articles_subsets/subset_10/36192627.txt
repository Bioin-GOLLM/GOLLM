Projected potential of 2.5-4.0 Å cryo-EM structures for structure-based drug 
design is not well realized yet. Here we show that a 3.1 Å structure of PRMT5 is 
suitable for selecting computed poses of a chemical inhibitor and its analogs 
for enhanced potency. PRMT5, an oncogenic target for various cancer types, has 
many inhibitors manifesting little cooperativity with MTA, a co-factor analog 
accumulated in MTAP-/- cells. To achieve MTA-synergic inhibition, a 
pharmacophore from virtual screen leads to a specific inhibitor (11-2 F). 
Cryo-EM structures of 11-2 F / MTA-bound human PRMT5/MEP50 complex and its apo 
form resolved at 3.1 and 3.2 Å respectively show that 11-2 F in the catalytic 
pocket shifts the cofactor-binding pocket away by ~2.0 Å, contributing to 
positive cooperativity. Computational analysis predicts subtype specificity of 
11-2 F among PRMTs. Structural analysis of ligands in the binding pockets is 
performed to compare poses of 11-2 F and its redesigned analogs and identifies 
three new analogs predicted to have significantly better potency. One of them, 
after synthesis, is ~4 fold more efficient in inhibiting PRMT5 catalysis than 
11-2 F, with strong MTA-synergy. These data suggest the feasibility of employing 
near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures and computational analysis of ligand 
poses for small molecule therapeutics.
