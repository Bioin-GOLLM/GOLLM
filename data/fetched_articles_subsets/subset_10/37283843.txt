Using hybridized [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with 
cardiac magnetic resonance, we identify active myocardial inflammation and 
demonstrate its relationship with late gadolinium enhancement, in Fabry disease. 
We demonstrate that late gadolinium enhancement represents, at least in part, 
active myocardial inflammation and identify an early inflammatory phenotype that 
may represent a therapeutic window before irreversible tissue injury and 
adaptation occur. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
