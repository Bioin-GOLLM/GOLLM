OBJECTIVES: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates nutritional energy as heat 
through uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). The discovery of functional BAT in healthy 
adult humans has promoted the search for pharmacological interventions to 
recruit and activate brown fat as a treatment of obesity and diabetes type II. 
These efforts require in vivo models to compare the efficacy of novel compounds 
in a relevant physiological context.
METHODS: We generated a knock-in mouse line expressing firefly luciferase and 
near-infrared red florescent protein (iRFP713) driven by the regulatory elements 
of the endogenous Ucp1 gene.
RESULTS: Our detailed characterization revealed that firefly luciferase activity 
faithfully reports endogenous Ucp1 gene expression in response to physiological 
and pharmacological stimuli. The iRFP713 fluorescence signal was detected in the 
interscapular BAT region of cold-exposed reporter mice in an allele-dosage 
dependent manner. Using this reporter mouse model, we detected a higher browning 
capacity in female peri-ovarian white adipose tissue compared to male epididymal 
WAT, which we further corroborated by molecular and morphological features. In 
situ imaging detected a strong luciferase activity signal in a previously 
unappreciated adipose tissue depot adjunct to the femoral muscle, now adopted as 
femoral brown adipose tissue. In addition, screening cultured adipocytes by 
bioluminescence imaging identified the selective Salt-Inducible Kinase 
inhibitor, HG-9-91-01, to increase Ucp1 gene expression and mitochondrial 
respiration in brown and brite adipocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: In our mouse model, firefly luciferase activity serves as a bona 
fide reporter for dynamic regulation of Ucp1. In addition, by means of iRFP713 
we are able to monitor Ucp1 expression in a non-invasive fashion.
