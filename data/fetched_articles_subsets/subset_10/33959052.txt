Genetic markers of the endocannabinoid system have been linked to a variety of 
addiction-related behaviors that extend beyond cannabis use. In the current 
study we investigate the relationship between endocannabinoid (eCB) genetic 
markers and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in European adolescents (14-18 years old) 
followed in the IMAGEN study (n = 2,051) and explore replication in a cohort of 
North American adolescents from Canadian Saguenay Youth Study (SYS) (n = 772). 
Case-control status is represented by a score of more than 7 on the Alcohol Use 
Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). First a set-based test method was used to 
examine if a relationship between the eCB system and AUDIT case/control status 
exists at the gene level. Using only SNPs that are both independent and 
significantly associated to case-control status, we perform Fisher's exact test 
to determine SNP level odds ratios in relation to case-control status and then 
perform logistic regressions as post-hoc analysis, while considering various 
covariates. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to 
analyze the most robust SNP×SNP interaction of the five eCB genes with positive 
AUDIT screen. While no gene-sets were significantly associated to AUDIT scores 
after correction for multiple tests, in the case/control analysis, 7 SNPs were 
significantly associated with AUDIT scores of > 7 (p < 0.05; OR<1). Two SNPs 
remain significant after correction by false discovery rate (FDR): rs9343525 in 
CNR1 (pcorrected =0.042, OR = 0.73) and rs507961 in MGLL (pcorrected = 0.043, OR 
= 0.78). Logistic regression showed that both rs9353525 (CNR1) and rs507961 
(MGLL) remained significantly associated with positive AUDIT screens (p < 0.01; 
OR < 1) after correction for multiple covariables and interaction of covariable 
× SNP. This result was not replicated in the SYS cohort. The GMDR model revealed 
a significant three-SNP interaction (p = 0.006) involving rs484061 (MGLL), 
rs4963307 (DAGLA), and rs7766029 (CNR1) predicted case-control status, after 
correcting for multiple covariables in the IMAGEN sample. A binomial logistic 
regression of the combination of these three SNPs by phenotype in the SYS cohort 
showed a result in the same direction as seen in the IMAGEN cohort (BETA = 
0.501, p = 0.06). While preliminary, the present study suggests that the eCB 
system may play a role in the development of AUD in adolescents.
