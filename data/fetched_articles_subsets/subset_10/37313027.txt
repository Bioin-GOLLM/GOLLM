INTRODUCTION: The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are important, 
particularly in the proteins' synthesis, folding, modification, and transport. 
Based on traditional medicine and our previous studies on Zanthoxylum alatum in 
lipopolysaccharide-induced depressive behavior and scopolamine-induced impaired 
memory, the present study explored the role of hydroalcoholic extract of Z. 
alatum (ZAHA) seeds in reducing the ER stress in mice.
METHODS: The mice were restrained for 28 days in polystyrene tubes. ZAHA (100 
and 200 mg/kg, PO) and imipramine (10 mg/kg, IP) were administered daily, 45 min 
before restraint from day 22 to 28. The mice were assessed by the forced swim 
test. Also, the antioxidant enzyme levels of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), reduced 
glutathione (GSH), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were measured in the hippocampus 
of mice. The expression of 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), 94 kDa 
Glucose-Regulated Protein (GRP94), and C/EBPhomologous protein (CHOP) genes was 
assessed by real-time PCR to explore the molecular mechanism.
RESULTS: ZAHA (100 and 200 mg/kg, PO, and imipramine, IP) counteracted the 
stress by significantly reducing the immobility time in the force swimming test, 
receding oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. The antioxidant enzyme (SOD 
and GSH) levels were elevated in the restraint stress group. Down-regulation of 
genes (GRP78, GRP94, and CHOP) compared to the chronic restraint stress group 
indicated stress modulating properties of the seeds in ER stress. Hesperidin, 
magnoflorine, melicopine, and sesamin, isolated from the active extract, were 
hypothesized to exert the activity.
CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that Z. alatum reverted chronic restraint stress 
through its antioxidant properties and down-regulation of genes involved in ER 
stress.
