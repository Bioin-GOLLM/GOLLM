Homologous recombination (HR) is a ubiquitous and efficient process that serves 
the repair of severe forms of DNA damage and the generation of genetic diversity 
during meiosis. HR can proceed via multiple pathways with different outcomes 
that may aid or impair genome stability and faithful inheritance, underscoring 
the importance of HR quality control. Human Bloom's syndrome (BLM, RecQ family) 
helicase plays central roles in HR pathway selection and quality control via 
unexplored molecular mechanisms. Here we show that BLM's multi-domain structural 
architecture supports a balance between stabilization and disruption of 
displacement loops (D-loops), early HR intermediates that are key targets for HR 
regulation. We find that this balance is markedly shifted toward efficient 
D-loop disruption by the presence of BLM's interaction partners Topoisomerase 
IIIα-RMI1-RMI2, which have been shown to be involved in multiple steps of 
HR-based DNA repair. Our results point to a mechanism whereby BLM can 
differentially process D-loops and support HR control depending on cellular 
regulatory mechanisms.
