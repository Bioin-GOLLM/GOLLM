ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers are mutated in more than 20% of human 
cancers. The consequences of these mutations on enzyme function are poorly 
understood. Here, we characterise the effects of CHD4 mutations identified in 
endometrial carcinoma on the remodelling properties of dMi-2, the highly 
conserved Drosophila homologue of CHD4. Mutations from different patients have 
surprisingly diverse defects on nucleosome binding, ATPase activity and 
nucleosome remodelling. Unexpectedly, we identify both mutations that decrease 
and increase the enzyme activity. Our results define the chromodomains and a 
novel regulatory region as essential for nucleosome remodelling. Genetic 
experiments in Drosophila demonstrate that expression of cancer-derived dMi-2 
mutants misregulates differentiation of epithelial wing structures and produces 
phenotypes that correlate with their nucleosome remodelling properties. Our 
results help to define the defects of CHD4 in cancer at the mechanistic level 
and provide the basis for the development of molecular approaches aimed at 
restoring their activity.
