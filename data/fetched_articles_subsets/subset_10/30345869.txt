BACKGROUND: Etomidate is a preferred drug for the induction of general 
anesthesia in cardiovascular risk patients. As with propofol and other 
perioperatively used anesthetics, the application of aqueous etomidate 
formulations causes an intensive burning pain upon injection. Such algogenic 
properties of etomidate have been attributed to the solubilizer propylene glycol 
which represents 35% of the solution administered clinically. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms which lead to 
injection pain of aqueous etomidate formulations.
RESULTS: Activation of the nociceptive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion 
channels TRPA1 and TRPV1 was studied in a transfected HEK293t cell line by 
whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of induced inward ion currents. Calcium 
influx in sensory neurons of wild-type and trp knockout mice was ratiometrically 
measured by Fura2-AM staining. Stimulated calcitonin gene-related peptide 
release from mouse sciatic nerves was detected by enzyme immunoassay. 
Painfulness of different etomidate formulations was tested in a translational 
human pain model. Etomidate as well as propylene glycol proved to be effective 
agonists of TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Etomidate consistently activated TRPA1, but there was also evidence for a 
contribution of TRPV1 in dependence of drug concentration ranges and species 
specificities. Distinct N-terminal cysteine and lysine residues seemed to 
mediate gating of TRPA1, although the electrophile scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine 
did not prevent its activation by etomidate. Propylene glycol-induced activation 
of TRPA1 and TRPV1 appeared independent of the concomitant high osmolarity. 
Intradermal injections of etomidate as well as propylene glycol evoked severe 
burning pain in the human pain model that was absent with emulsification of 
etomidate.
CONCLUSIONS: Data in our study provided evidence that pain upon injection of 
clinical aqueous etomidate formulations is not an unspecific effect of 
hyperosmolarity but rather due to a specific action mediated by activated 
nociceptive TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels in sensory neurons.
