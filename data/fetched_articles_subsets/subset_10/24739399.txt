We have compared the melanogenic activities of cultured melanocytes carrying two 
common TYR alleles as homozygous 192S-402R wild-type, heterozygous and 
homozygous variant. This includes assays of TYR protein, DOPAoxidase activity, 
glycosylation and temperature sensitivity of protein and DOPAoxidase levels. 
Homozygous wild-type strains on average had higher levels of TYR protein and 
enzyme activity than other genotypes. Homozygous 402Q/Q melanocytes produced 
significantly less TYR protein, displayed altered trafficking and glycosylation, 
with reduced DOPAoxidase. However, near wild-type TYR activity levels could be 
recovered at lower growth temperature. In a sample population from Southeast 
Queensland, these two polymorphisms were present on four TYR haplotypes, 
designated as WT 192S-402R, 192Y-402R and 192S-402Q with a double-variant 
192Y-402Q of low frequency at 1.9%. Based on cell culture findings and haplotype 
associations, we have used an additive model to assess the penetrance of the ten 
possible TYR genotypes derived from the combination of these haplotypes.
