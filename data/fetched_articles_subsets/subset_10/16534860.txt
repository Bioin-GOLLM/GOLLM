AIM: To investigate the genetic relationship between Hirschsprung's disease (HD) 
and intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) in Chinese population.
METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 30 HD patients, 20 IND 
patients, 18 HD/IND combined patients and 20 normal individuals as control. 
Genomic DNA was extracted according to standard procedure. Exons 11,13,15,17 of 
RET proto-oncogene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 
mutations of RET proto-oncogene were analyzed by single strand conformational 
polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing of the positive amplified products was 
performed.
RESULTS: Eight germline sequence variants were detected. In HD patients, 2 
missense mutations in exon 11 at nucleotide 15165 G-->A (G667S), 2 frameshift 
mutations in exon 13 at nucleotide 18974 (18974insG), 1 missense mutation in 
exon 13 at nucleotide 18919 A-->G (K756E) and 1 silent mutation in exon 15 at 
nucleotide 20692 G-->A(Q916Q) were detected. In HD/IND combined patients, 1 
missense mutation in exon 11 at nucleotide 15165 G-->A and 1 silent mutation in 
exon 13 at nucleotide 18888 T-->G (L745L) were detected. No mutation was found 
in IND patients and controls.
CONCLUSION: Mutation of RET proto-oncogene is involved in the etiopathogenesis 
of HD. The frequency of RET proto-oncogene mutation is quite different between 
IND and HD in Chinese population. IND is a distinct clinical entity genetically 
different from HD.
