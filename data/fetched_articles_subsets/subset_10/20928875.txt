A simple technique is implemented for correction of artifacts arising from 
nonuniform T(2) -weighting of k-space data in fast spin echo-based PROPELLER 
(periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction). 
An additional blade with no phase-encoding gradients is acquired to generate the 
scaling factor used for the correction. Results from simulations and phantom 
experiments, as well as in vivo experiments in free-breathing mice, demonstrate 
the advantages of the proposed method. This technique is developed specifically 
for high-field imaging applications where T(2) decay is rapid.
