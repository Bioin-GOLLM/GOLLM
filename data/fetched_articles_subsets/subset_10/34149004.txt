There is a lack of pharmacogenetic predictors of outcome in gastric cancer 
patients. The aim of this study was to assess previously identified candidate 
genes associated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, or epirubicin toxicity 
or response in a cohort of resected gastric cancer patients treated on CALGB 
(Alliance) 80101. Gastric or gastroesophageal cancer patients randomized to 
adjuvant 5-FU/leucovorin or epirubicin/cisplatin/5-FU before and after 5-FU 
chemoradiation were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
GSTP1 (rs1695), ERCC1 (rs11615 and rs3212986), XRCC1 (rs25487), UGT2B7 
(rs7439366) and the 28 base-pair tandem repeats in TYMS (rs34743033). Logistic 
regression and log rank tests were used to assess the association between each 
SNP and incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia and leukopenia, overall (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS), respectively. Toxicity endpoint analyses were 
adjusted for the treatment arm, while OS and PFS were also adjusted for 
performance status, sex, age, lymph node involvement, and primary tumor site and 
size. Of 281 subjects with successful genotyping results and available clinical 
(toxicity and efficacy) data, 166 self-reported non-Hispanic White patients were 
included in the final analysis. There was a lack of evidence of an association 
among any SNPs tested with grade 3/4 neutropenia and leukopenia or OS and PFS. 
Age, lymph node involvement, and primary tumor size were significantly 
associated with OS and PFS. This study failed to confirm results of previous 
gastric cancer pharmacogenetic studies.
