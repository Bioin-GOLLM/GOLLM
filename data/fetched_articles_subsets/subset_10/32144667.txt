The split inteins from the DnaE cyanobacterial family are efficient and 
versatile tools for protein engineering and chemical biology applications. Their 
ultrafast splicing kinetics allow for the efficient production of native 
proteins from two separate polypeptides both in vitro and in cells. They can 
also be used to generate proteins with C-terminal thioesters for downstream 
applications. In this chapter, we describe a method based on a genetically fused 
version of the DnaE intein Npu for the preparation of doubly modified proteins 
through recombinant expression. In particular, we provide protocols for the 
recombinant production of modified ubiquitin through amber suppression where 
fused Npu is used (1) as a traceless purification tag or (2) as a protein 
engineering tool to introduce C-terminal modifications for subsequent attachment 
to other proteins of interest. Our purification protocol allows for quick and 
facile separation of truncated products and eliminates the need for engineering 
protease cleavage sites. Our approach can be easily adapted to different 
proteins and applications where the simultaneous presence of internal and 
C-terminal modifications is desirable.
