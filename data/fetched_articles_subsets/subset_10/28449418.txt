A classic response to systemic hypoxia is the increase in red blood cell 
production. This response is controlled by the prolyl hydroxylase 
domain/hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, which regulates a broad spectrum 
of cellular functions. The discovery of this pathway as a key regulator of 
erythropoiesis has led to the development of small molecules that stimulate the 
production of endogenous erythropoietin and enhance iron metabolism. This review 
provides a concise overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern 
HIF-induced erythropoietic responses and provides an update on clinical 
experience with compounds that target HIF-prolyl hydroxylases for anemia 
therapy.
