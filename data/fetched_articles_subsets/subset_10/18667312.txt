Irreversible HER/erbB inhibitors selectively inhibit HER-family kinases by 
targeting a unique cysteine residue located within the ATP-binding pocket. 
Sequence alignment reveals that this rare cysteine is also present in ten other 
protein kinases including all five Tec-family members. We demonstrate that the 
Tec-family kinase Bmx is potently inhibited by irreversible modification at 
Cys496 by clinical stage EGFR inhibitors such as CI-1033. This cross-reactivity 
may have significant clinical implications.
