Extensive changes in DNA methylation are common in cancer and may contribute to 
oncogenesis through transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. 
Genome-scale studies have yielded important insights into these changes but have 
focused on CpG islands or gene promoters. We used whole-genome bisulfite 
sequencing (bisulfite-seq) to comprehensively profile a primary human colorectal 
tumor and adjacent normal colon tissue at single-basepair resolution. Regions of 
focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and 
were concentrated within regions of long-range (>100 kb) hypomethylation. These 
hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late 
replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines. We 
confirmed the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation within these 
domains in 25 diverse colorectal tumors and matched adjacent tissue. We propose 
that widespread DNA methylation changes in cancer are linked to silencing 
programs orchestrated by the three-dimensional organization of chromatin within 
the nucleus.
