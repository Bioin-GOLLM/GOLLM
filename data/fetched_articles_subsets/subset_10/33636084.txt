DCAF16 is a substrate recognition component of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases 
that can be targeted by electrophilic PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras) 
to promote the nuclear-restricted degradation of proteins. The endogenous 
protein substates of DCAF16 remain unknown. In this study, we compared the 
protein content of DCAF16-wild type and DCAF16-knockout (KO) cells by untargeted 
mass spectrometry-based proteomics, identifying the Tudor domain-containing 
protein Spindlin-4 (SPIN4) as a protein with a level that was substantially 
increased in cells lacking DCAF16. Very few other proteomic changes were found 
in DCAF16-KO cells, pointing to a specific relationship between DCAF16 and 
SPIN4. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that DCAF16 interacts with and 
ubiquitinates SPIN4, but not other related SPIN proteins, and identified a 
conserved lysine residue unique to SPIN4 that is involved in DCAF16 binding. 
Finally, we provide evidence that SPIN4 preferentially binds trimethylated 
histone H3K4 over other modified histone modifications. These results, taken 
together, indicate that DCAF16 and SPIN4 form a dedicated E3 ligase-substrate 
complex that regulates the turnover and presumed functions of SPIN4 in human 
cells.
