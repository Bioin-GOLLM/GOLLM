Shiga toxins and ricin are potent inhibitors of protein synthesis. In addition 
to causing inhibition of protein synthesis, these toxins activate 
proinflammatory signaling cascades that may contribute to the severe diseases 
associated with toxin exposure. Treatment of cells with Shiga toxins and ricin 
have been shown to activate a number of signaling pathways including those 
associated with the ribotoxic stress response, Nuclear factor kappa B 
activation, inflammasome activation, the unfolded protein response, mTOR 
signaling, hemostasis, and retrograde trafficking. In this chapter, we review 
our current understanding of these signaling pathways as they pertain to 
intoxication by Shiga toxins and ricin.
