Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) is crucial in tumorigenesis and resistance to 
target therapy. Here, we used mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH) to 
measure ITH based on next-generation sequencing data and high MATH was proven as 
an independent risk prognostic factor in male CRC patients in both a training 
set of 284 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) and a validating set of 187 CRC patients from International Cancer Genome 
Consortium (ICGC). Further, the genomic pattern according to MATH demonstrated 
that mutation rates of TP53, IRF5 and KRAS were independently associated with 
MATH, and the latter two were only significant in male patients. As MATH 
increased, the fraction of somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) elevated. 
Moreover, more SCNA events was independently associated with MATH in male than 
in female. WNT pathway, TGF-β pathway and DNA repair deficiency was enriched in 
high MATH group and the latter two showed up only in male patients. In summary, 
we reveal the gender-related prognostic value of MATH and relevant genomic 
pattern in CRC. Potential mechanisms are provided and it remains to be proven 
whether they are drivers of subclone formation and ITH. Taking MATH into 
consideration in clinical trial might contribute to better therapeutic 
strategies in CRC with researches added on in the future.
