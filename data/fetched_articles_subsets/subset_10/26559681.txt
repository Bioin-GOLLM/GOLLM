BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinaemia, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular 
diseases, is common in hemodialysis patients (HD) and particularly in those 
homozygous for polymorphism of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 
(MTHFR) gene. B vitamins supplementation has been shown to lower plasma total 
homocysteine (tHcy), but this has been contreversed in several groups. The aim 
of our study was to explore the response of tHcy in hemodialysis (HD) patients 
to individual supplementation with folic acid (B9) and/or vitamin B12, based on 
carrier status for the (MTHFR) polymorphism.
METHODS: 132HD were randomized according to C677TMTHFR genotypes into 2 groups 
(AandB). The group (A) was treated initially with B9 (10mg/day orally) for 
2 months (t1) and then with B12 vitamin (cyanocobalamin ampoule of 1000 μg) for 
the following 2 months (t2), then association of B9 and B12 for 2 months (t3). 
The group (B) was supplemented initially with vitamin B12 (t1), then with folic 
acid (t2) and then B9 + B12 for 2 months (t3). A wash-out period of 2 months 
followed the treatment in both groups (t4). We determined tHcy, B9 and B12 
concentrations at each time.
RESULTS: In group A, we noted that the decrease in tHcy becomes significant for 
CC when patients were supplemented with vit B12 only (p = 0.009). While, 
B9 + vit B12 supplementation did not seem to improve a significant effect 
compared with B12 alone. For genotypes (CT) and (TT) we noticed a significant 
decrease in tHcy at t1 (p = 0.038; 0.005 respectively) and at (t3; CT p = 0.024; 
TT p = 0.017). In group B, for genotypes CC, the decrease in tHcy became 
significant at t3 (vit B12 + B9; p = 0.031). For genotypes (CT) and (TT), at the 
replacement of vit B12 by B9, tHcy was significantly decreased (p = 0.036; 
0.012, respectively). The combination of the 2 vitamins (t3) showed no 
difference compared to folate alone. In the 2 groups (t4), there was an 
significant increase of tHcy again for 3 genotypes.
CONCLUSION: Supplementation with B vitamins correlated to the MTHFR genotypes 
has been shown to lower significantly tHcy in HD patients.
