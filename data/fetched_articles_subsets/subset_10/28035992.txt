This review focuses on the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSC), bone formation and turn-over in good and ill skeletal fates. The 
interacting molecular pathways which control bone remodeling in physiological 
conditions during a lifelong process are described. Then, alterations of the 
molecular pathways regulating osteogenesis are addressed. In the aging process, 
as well as in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, bone loss is caused not only 
by an unbalanced bone resorption activity, but also by an impairment of MSCs' 
commitment towards the osteogenic lineage, in favour of adipogenesis. Mutations 
affecting the expression of key genes involved in the control of bone 
development occur in several heritable bone disorders. A few examples are 
described in order to illustrate the pathological consequences of perturbation 
in different steps of osteogenic commitment, osteoblast maturation, and matrix 
mineralization, respectively. The involvement of abnormal MSC differentiation in 
cancer is then discussed. Finally, a brief overview of clinical applications of 
MSCs in bone regeneration and repair is presented.
