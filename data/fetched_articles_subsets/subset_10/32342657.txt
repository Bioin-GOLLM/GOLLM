BACKGROUND: With several susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms 
identified by case-control association studies, Graves' disease is one of the 
most common forms of autoimmune thyroid disease. In this study, we aimed to 
determine whether any observed differences in genetic associations are 
influenced by sex in Chinese Han populations.
METHODS: A total of 8,835 patients with Graves' disease and 9,936 sex-matched 
healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Confirmed by a two-staged 
association analysis, sex-specific analyses among 20 Graves' disease 
susceptibility loci were conducted.
RESULTS: A significant sex-gene interaction was detected primarily at rs5912838 
on Xq21.1 between the GPR174 and ITM2A genes, whereby male Graves' disease 
patients possessed a significantly higher frequency of risk alleles than their 
female counterparts. Interestingly, compared to women, male patients with 
Graves' disease had a higher cumulative genetic risk and higher persistent 
thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody-positive rate after receiving 
antithyroid drug therapy for at least 1 year.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest the existence of one potential 
sex-specific Graves' disease variant on Xq21.1. This could increase our 
understanding of the pivotal mechanism behind Graves' disease and ultimately aid 
in identifying possible therapeutic targets.
