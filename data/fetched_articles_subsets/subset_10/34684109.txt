Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent chronic metabolic disease 
characterized by prolonged hyperglycemia that leads to long-term health 
consequences. It is estimated that impaired healing of diabetic wounds affects 
approximately 25% of all patients with diabetes mellitus, often resulting in 
lower limb amputation, with subsequent high economic and psychosocial costs. The 
hyperglycemic environment promotes the formation of biofilms and makes diabetic 
wounds difficult to treat. In this review, we present updates regarding recent 
advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic wounds focusing 
on impaired angiogenesis, neuropathy, sub-optimal chronic inflammatory response, 
barrier disruption, and subsequent polymicrobial infection, followed by current 
and future treatment strategies designed to tackle the various pathologies 
associated with diabetic wounds. Given the alarming increase in the prevalence 
of diabetes, and subsequently diabetic wounds, it is imperative that future 
treatment strategies target multiple causes of impaired healing in diabetic 
wounds.
