SAMHD1 activity is regulated by a network of mechanisms including 
phosphorylation, oxidation, oligomerization, and others. Significant questions 
remain about the effects of phosphorylation on SAMHD1 function and activity. We 
investigated the effects of a SAMHD1 T592E phosphorylation mimic on its cellular 
localization, catalytic activity, and cell cycle progression. We found that the 
SAMHD1 T592E is a catalytically active enzyme that is inhibited by protein 
oxidation. SAMHD1 T592E is retained in the nucleus at higher levels than the 
wild-type protein during growth factor-mediated signaling. This nuclear 
localization protects SAMHD1 from oxidation by cytoplasmic reactive oxygen 
species. The SAMHD1 T592E phosphomimetic further inhibits the cell cycle S/G2 
transition. This has significant implications for SAMHD1 function in regulating 
innate immunity, antiviral response and DNA replication.
