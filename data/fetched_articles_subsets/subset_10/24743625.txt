OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic survey of 
common precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 
evaluate their clinical relevance in patients with major blunt trauma.
BACKGROUND: Recent evidence indicates that small noncoding RNA molecules known 
as miRNAs can function as important negative gene regulators and are implicated 
in the pathogenesis of various diseases.
METHODS: We conducted a 2-stage study to examine the impact of 9 selected SNPs 
with potential functional significance on the susceptibility to sepsis of 1268 
trauma patients (1 screening cohort, n = 666) and 2 independent validated 
cohorts (n = 286 and n = 316, respectively) in China.
RESULTS: Among the 9 selected SNPs with potential functional significance, only 
1 (miR-608 rs4919510) was found to be strongly associated with a higher risk of 
developing sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction in all 3 independent study 
cohorts. An even stronger association was observed for the rs4919510 
polymorphism when combining these 3 study cohorts together. In addition, the 
rs4919510 polymorphism showed a significant correlation with a higher production 
of proinflammatory cytokines and a lower production of anti-inflammatory 
cytokines. In vitro experiments further indicated that the G→C variant of this 
polymorphism could significantly increase the expression of mature miR-608.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the rs4919510G/C SNP in hsa-mir-608 may 
be a prognostic biomarker for sepsis in patients with major trauma. Further 
characterization of miRNA SNPs may open new avenues for studying sepsis and 
developing novel therapeutic approaches.
