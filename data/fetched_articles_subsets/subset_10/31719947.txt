BACKGROUND: Recent reports have suggested that lower vitamin D serum levels are 
associated with susceptibility to and severity of asthma in different white 
populations, which may be due to a lack of sunlight exposure, genetic 
polymorphism of vitamin D pathway genes, and dietary intake. We investigated the 
associations between vitamin D concentration, genetic polymorphism of the 
vitamin D receptor (VDR), and asthma traits in Mongolian and Taiwanese 
populations that inhabited two different geographical areas.
METHODS: In total, 328 Han Taiwanese subjects and 381 Mongolian subjects were 
enrolled, and their vitamin D serum levels assayed. Genomic DNA of 178 Han 
Taiwanese subjects and 90 Mongolian subjects was obtained from blood samples. 
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VDR, ApaI (rs7975232), TaqI 
(rs731236), BsmI (rs1544410) and FokI (rs2228570), were selected for genotyping. 
Logistic regression analyses were performed to detect an association between 
allergic asthma status and the interaction of the VDR SNP and serum vitamin D 
concentration in the case-control samples.
RESULTS: We observed a significantly lower vitamin D level in the Mongolian 
subjects as compared with the Taiwanese population. In particular, in the 
population under 14 years of age, the serum vitamin D level was significantly 
higher in the Taiwanese population, in both non-asthmatic and asthmatic 
subjects, than in the Mongolian non-asthmatic and asthmatic subjects, 
respectively (P < 0.01). Moreover, the vitamin D level in the asthmatic children 
was significantly lower than that in the non-asthmatic children in both the 
Taiwanese and Mongolian populations (P < 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, we 
found that the rs2228570 genotype (OR, 3.763) of the VDR SNP and the vitamin D 
concentration (lower than 40 ng/ml, OR: 38.938) both contribute to increased 
susceptibility to bronchial asthma.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated an association between vitamin D 
concentration and the risk of asthma in two populations of differing ethnicity 
living in different geographical areas. This information implies a potential 
role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of asthma worldwide.
