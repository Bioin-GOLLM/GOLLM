A number of C5a modifications were tested to determine effects on receptor 
binding to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) membrane receptors and triggering 
of PMNL chemokinesis and myeloperoxidase (MPO) release. Site-directed 
mutagenesis was used to probe relationships of key C-terminal residues, and 
suggested a role for additional sites, particularly Lys19-20. A synthetic 
peptide based on C5a 19-30, weakly inhibited C5a binding. Potency of the 
C-terminal octapeptide, a full agonist, was markedly improved by a single Phe 
substitution for His67, and a Phe point mutation at this site was shown to 
enhance activity of the full recombinant protein.
