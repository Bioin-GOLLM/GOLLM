BACKGROUND: CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are biologically potential genes responsible for 
prostate cancer.
AIM: We aimed to analyse the expression and association of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 
genes in prostate cancer.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Web-based bioinformatics tools were used to assess the 
association of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes with prostate cancer risks. A 
case-control study of 210 prostate cancer cases and 207 controls was also 
approved to determine the allelic variants of the CYP3A4 gene- rs2740574 
(CYP3A4*1B) and the variant of CYP3A5 gene-rs776746 (CYP3A5*3) using Polymerase 
Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The risk of 
prostate cancer was estimated as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval 
(CI) using unrestricted logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Our in silico data confirmed that both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes are 
significantly associated with higher prostate cancer risks. In the case of 
CYP3A4*1B polymorphism, the heterozygote (*1â€‰A/*1B), mutant (*1B/*1B), and 
combined heterozygote plus mutant (*1A/*1B+*1B/*1B) genotypes showed 3.52-fold, 
3.90-fold, and 3.67-fold increased risk of prostate cancer, respectively. In the 
case of CYP3A5*3 polymorphism, the heterozygote (*1/*3), mutant (*3/*3), and 
combined (*1/*3+*3/*3) genotypes were found to be significantly associated with 
5.11-, 5.49-, and 5.28-fold greater risk of prostate cancer, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*3 are significantly 
associated with increased prostate cancer risk.KEY MESSAGESBioinformatics tools 
were used and concluded that the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes were significantly 
associated with the development and progression of prostate cancer.CYP3A4 and 
CYP3A5 polymorphisms were significantly associated with an increased risk of 
prostate cancer.Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-Restriction Fragment Length 
Polymorphism (RFLP) was used to estimate polymorphisms of prostate cancer 
progression in the Bangladeshi population.
