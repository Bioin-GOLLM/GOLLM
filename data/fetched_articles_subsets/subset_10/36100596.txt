Chronic inflammation is frequently associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms 
(MPN), but the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of MPN remains unclear. 
Expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is elevated in 
patients with MPN as well as in Jak2V617F knock-in mice. Here, we show that 
genetic deletion of IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) normalizes peripheral blood counts, 
reduces splenomegaly and ameliorates bone marrow fibrosis in homozygous 
Jak2V617F mouse model of myelofibrosis. Deletion of IL-1R1 also significantly 
reduces Jak2V617F mutant hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Exogenous 
administration of IL-1β enhances myeloid cell expansion and accelerates the 
development of bone marrow fibrosis in heterozygous Jak2V617F mice. Furthermore, 
treatment with anti-IL-1R1 antibodies significantly reduces leukocytosis and 
splenomegaly, and ameliorates bone marrow fibrosis in homozygous Jak2V617F mice. 
Collectively, these results suggest that IL-1 signaling plays a pathogenic role 
in MPN disease progression, and targeting of IL-1R1 could be a useful strategy 
for the treatment of myelofibrosis.
