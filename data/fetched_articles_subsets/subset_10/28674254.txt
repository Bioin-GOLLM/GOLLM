Caffeine promotes memory consolidation. Memory consolidation is thought to 
depend at least in part on hippocampal sharp waves (SWs). In the present study, 
we investigated the effect of bath-application of caffeine in spontaneously 
occurring SWs in mouse acute hippocampal slices. Caffeine induced an about 100% 
increase in the event frequency of SWs at concentrations of 60 and 200 µM. The 
effect of caffeine was reversible after washout of caffeine and was mimicked by 
an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, but not by an A2A receptor antagonist. 
Caffeine increased SWs even in dentate-CA3 mini-slices without the CA2 regions, 
in which adenosine A1 receptors are abundantly expressed in the hippocampus. 
Thus, caffeine facilitates SWs by inhibiting adenosine A1 receptors in the 
hippocampal CA3 region or the dentate gyrus.
