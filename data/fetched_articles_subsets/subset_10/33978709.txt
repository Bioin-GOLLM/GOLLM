The ER tethers tightly to mitochondria and the mitochondrial protein FUNDC1 
recruits Drp1 to ER-mitochondria contact sites, subsequently facilitating 
mitochondrial fission and preventing mitochondria from undergoing hypoxic 
stress. However, the mechanisms by which the ER modulates hypoxia-induced 
mitochondrial fission are poorly understood. Here, we show that USP19, an 
ER-resident deubiquitinase, accumulates at ER-mitochondria contact sites under 
hypoxia and promotes hypoxia-induced mitochondrial division. In response to 
hypoxia, USP19 binds to and deubiquitinates FUNDC1 at ER-mitochondria contact 
sites, which facilitates Drp1 oligomerization and Drp1 GTP-binding and 
hydrolysis activities, thereby promoting mitochondrial division. Our findings 
reveal a unique hypoxia response pathway mediated by an ER protein that 
regulates mitochondrial dynamics.
