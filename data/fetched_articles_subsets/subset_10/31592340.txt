Obesity is demonstrated to be a risk factor in the development of cancers of 
various organs, such as colon, prostate, pancreas and so on. Leptine (LEP) is 
the most renowned of the adipokines. As a hormone, it mediates its effect 
through leptin receptor (LEPR), which is widely expressed in various tissues 
including colon mucosa. In this study, we have investigated the degree of 
expression of LEP and LEPR in colorectal cancer (CRC). We collected 44 
surgically resected colon cancer tissues along with normal adjacent colon tissue 
(NACT) from a sample of CRC patients from the Malaysian population and looked 
for leptin and leptin receptors using immunohistochemistry (IHC). All the 
samples showed low presence of both LEP and LEPR in NACT, while both LEP and 
LEPR were present at high intensity in the cancerous tissues with 100% and 97.7% 
prevalence, respectively. Both were sparsed in the cytoplasm and were 
concentrated beneath the cell membrane. However, we did not find any significant 
correlation between their expression and pathological parameters like grade, 
tumor size, and lymph node involvement. Our study further emphasizes the 
possible causal role of LEP and LEPR with CRC, and also the prospect of using 
LEPR as a possible therapeutic target.
