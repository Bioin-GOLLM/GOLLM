BACKGROUND: The BRAFV600E mutation is the most common driver in papillary 
thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tumors. In recent years, gene fusions have also been 
recognized as important drivers of cancer in PTC. Previous studies have 
suggested that thyroid tumors with fusion genes frequently display an aggressive 
course. These observations prompted further exploration of gene fusions in PTC 
tumors. The aim was to search for previously unrecognized gene fusions using 
thyroid tissue samples from PTC patients.
METHODS: Gene fusions were analyzed in RNA sequencing data obtained from 12 PTC 
tumors and paired unaffected thyroid tissue samples. Candidate fusions were 
further filtered and validated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction, Sanger sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. An Ohio 
cohort of 148 PTC tumor samples was screened for a LMO7-BRAF fusion and the 
BRAFV600E mutation. Functional assays were performed to assess the LMO7-BRAF 
fusion.
RESULTS: Two coding fusions (CCDC6-RET and LMO7-BRAF) were found in one tumor 
sample each. The novel LMO7-BRAF fusion was validated by reverse transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The LMO7-BRAF 
fusion was a recurrent somatic alteration with a frequency of 2.0% (3/148) in 
PTC tumors, while the BRAFV600E point mutation was found in 63.5% (94/148) of 
tumors. Enforced expression of LMO7-BRAF fusion protein stimulated endogenous 
ERK1/2 phosphorylation and promoted anchorage independent cell growth to an 
extent similar to BRAFV600E.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel fusion gene, LMO7-BRAF, was identified in PTC tumors. The 
results indicate that the LMO7-BRAF fusion behaves as an oncogenic alteration. 
This observation expands the spectrum of fusion genes involving kinases in 
thyroid cancer.
