BACKGROUND: Associations between dairy intake and body mass index (BMI) have 
been inconsistently observed in epidemiological studies, and the causal 
relationship remains ill defined.
METHODS: We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using an established 
dairy intake-associated genetic polymorphism located upstream of the lactase 
gene (LCT-13910 C/T, rs4988235) as an instrumental variable (IV). Linear 
regression models were fitted to analyze associations between (a) dairy intake 
and BMI, (b) rs4988235 and dairy intake, and (c) rs4988235 and BMI in each 
study. The causal effect of dairy intake on BMI was quantified by IV estimators 
among 184802 participants from 25 studies.
RESULTS: Higher dairy intake was associated with higher BMI (β = 0.03 kg/m2 per 
serving/day; 95% CI, 0.00-0.06; P = 0.04), whereas the LCT genotype with 1 or 2 
T allele was significantly associated with 0.20 (95% CI, 0.14-0.25) serving/day 
higher dairy intake (P = 3.15 × 10-12) and 0.12 (95% CI, 0.06-0.17) kg/m2 higher 
BMI (P = 2.11 × 10-5). MR analysis showed that the genetically determined higher 
dairy intake was significantly associated with higher BMI (β = 0.60 kg/m2 per 
serving/day; 95% CI, 0.27-0.92; P = 3.0 × 10-4).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides strong evidence to support a causal 
effect of higher dairy intake on increased BMI among adults.
