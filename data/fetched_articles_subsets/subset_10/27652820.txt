PURPOSE: To report a case of pigmentary retinopathy in long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl 
coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency using multimodal imaging techniques.
METHODS: Case report.
RESULTS: An 8-year-old boy with a history of failure to thrive and a diagnosis 
of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency was referred for 
examination. Examination revealed a pigmentary retinopathy with macular atrophy; 
electroretinography results were consistent with a rod-cone dystrophy. Fundus 
autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography revealed retinal pigment 
epithelium atrophy. Follow-up examination findings showed increased severity of 
retinopathy on electroretinography, with optical coherence tomography 
angiography revealing enhanced visualization of choroidal vessels.
CONCLUSION: This report reveals that long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A 
dehydrogenase deficiency can be characterized as a progressive rod-cone 
dystrophy, with multi-modal imaging techniques used to describe this condition. 
In particular, optical coherence tomography angiography can be used to further 
characterize this condition.
