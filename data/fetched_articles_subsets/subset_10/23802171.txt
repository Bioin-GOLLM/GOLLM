OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore whether cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
antigen-4 (CTLA-4) +49 A/G, and -318 C/T polymorphisms confer susceptibility to 
multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: A meta-analysis of the associations between the CTLA-4 +49 A/G and 
-318 C/T polymorphisms and MS.
RESULTS: A total of 23 separate comparisons from 19 studies of the CTLA-4 +49 
A/G polymorphism and 10 comparisons (8 studies) of the CTLA-4 -318 C/T 
polymorphism were considered. Meta-analysis showed no association between MS and 
the CTLA-4 +49G allele in the analysis of all study subjects (OR = 1.026, 95% 
CI = 0.967-1.089, p = 0.395). Stratification by ethnicity indicated no 
association between the CTLA-4 +49G allele and MS in Caucasians, Asians, or 
Arabs. Meta-analysis showed no association between RA and the CTLA-4 -318C 
allele in all study subjects (OR = 0.909, 95% CI = 0.704-1.175, p = 0.467). In 
addition, meta-analysis stratified by ethnicity revealed no association between 
MS and the CTLA-4 -318 C/T polymorphism in Caucasian, Asian, or Arab 
populations.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of published studies did not find an association 
between the CTLA-4 +49 A/G and -318 C/T polymorphisms and susceptibility to MS 
in Caucasian, Asian, and Arab populations.
