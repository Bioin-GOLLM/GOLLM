Evidence for a shared genetic basis of association between coronary artery 
disease (CAD) and periodontitis (PD) exists. To explore the joint genetic basis, 
we performed a GWAS meta-analysis. In the discovery stage, we used a German 
aggressive periodontitis sample (AgP-Ger; 680 cases vs 3,973 controls) and the 
CARDIoGRAMplusC4D CAD meta-analysis dataset (60,801 cases vs 123,504 controls). 
Two SNPs at the known CAD risk loci ADAMTS7 (rs11634042) and VAMP8 (rs1561198) 
passed the pre-assigned selection criteria (PAgP-Ger < 0.05; PCAD < 5 × 10-8; 
concordant effect direction) and were replicated in an independent GWAS 
meta-analysis dataset of PD (4,415 cases vs 5,935 controls). SNP rs1561198 
showed significant association (PD[Replication]: P = 0.008 OR = 1.09, 95% 
CI = [1.02-1.16]; PD [Discovery + Replication]: P = 0.0002, OR = 1.11, 95% 
CI = [1.05-1.17]). For the associated haplotype block, allele specific 
cis-effects on VAMP8 expression were reported. Our data adds to the shared 
genetic basis of CAD and PD and indicate that the observed association of the 
two disease conditions cannot be solely explained by shared environmental risk 
factors. We conclude that the molecular pathway shared by CAD and PD involves 
VAMP8 function, which has a role in membrane vesicular trafficking, and is 
manipulated by pathogens to corrupt host immune defense.
