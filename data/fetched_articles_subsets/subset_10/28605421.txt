AIMS: Congo red staining of an endomyocardial biopsy is the diagnostic 
gold-standard in suspected cardiac amyloidosis (CA), but the procedure is 
associated with the risk, albeit small, of serious complications, and delay in 
diagnosis due to the requirement for technical expertise. In contrast, abdominal 
fat pad fine needle aspiration (FPFNA) is a simple, safe and well-established 
procedure in systemic amyloidosis, but its diagnostic sensitivity in patients 
with suspected CA remains unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the diagnostic sensitivity of FPFNA in 600 
consecutive patients diagnosed with CA [216 AL amyloidosis, 113 hereditary 
transthyretin (ATTRm), and 271 wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt) amyloidosis] at 
our Centre. Amyloid was detected on Congo red staining of FPFNAs in 181/216 
(84%) patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis, including 100, 97, and 78% of those 
with a large, moderate, and small whole-body amyloid burden, respectively, as 
assessed by serum amyloid P (SAP) component scintigraphy (P < 0.001); the 
deposits were successfully typed as AL by immunohistochemistry in 102/216 (47%) 
cases. Amyloid was detected in FPFNAs of 51/113 (45%) patients with ATTRm CA, 
and only 42/271 (15%) cases with ATTRwt CA.
CONCLUSIONS: FPFNA has reasonable diagnostic sensitivity in cardiac AL 
amyloidosis, particularly in patients with a large whole-body amyloid burden. 
Although the diagnostic sensitivity of FPFNA is substantially lower in 
transthyretin CA, particularly ATTRwt, it may nevertheless sometimes obviate the 
need for endomyocardial biopsy.
