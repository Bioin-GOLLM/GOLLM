BACKGROUND: The correlation between CYP11B2 rs1799998 polymorphism and atrial 
fibrillation (AF) was analyzed by several studies, but the results of these 
studies were inconsistent. Thus, we performed this study to obtain a more 
conclusive result on relationship between CYP11B2 rs1799998 polymorphism and AF.
METHODS: Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Medline and Embase. Odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the 
strength of correlation.
RESULTS: A total of 12 studies with 5466 participants were analyzed. We found 
that CYP11B2 rs1799998 polymorphism was significantly associated with AF in 
overall population under recessive genetic model with FEM (P = 0.005, OR = 1.29, 
95%CI 1.08-1.54), but no positive results were detected in overall analyses with 
REMs. Further subgroup analyses revealed that CYP11B2 rs1799998 polymorphism was 
significantly correlated with AF in East Asians, but not in West Asians. 
Furthermore, significant associations between rs1799998 polymorphism and AF were 
observed in subjects with essential hypertension (EH) and heart failure (HF). No 
any other positive results were found in overall and subgroup analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our meta-analysis suggested that rs1799998 polymorphism 
may serve as a potential biological marker of AF in East Asians and subjects 
with EH or HF.
