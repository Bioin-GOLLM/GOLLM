Fluorophore labeling of proteins while preserving native functions is essential 
for bulk FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) interaction and single 
molecule imaging analysis. Here we describe a versatile, efficient, specific, 
irreversible, gentle and low-cost method for labeling proteins with fluorophores 
that appears substantially more robust than a similar but chemically distinct 
procedure. The method employs the controlled enzymatic conversion of a central 
Cys to a reactive formylglycine (fGly) aldehyde within a six amino acid 
Formylglycine Generating Enzyme (FGE) recognition sequence in vitro. The 
fluorophore is then irreversibly linked to the fGly residue using a 
Hydrazinyl-Iso-Pictet-Spengler (HIPS) ligation reaction. We demonstrate the 
robust large-scale fluorophore labeling and purification of E.coli (Ec) mismatch 
repair (MMR) components. Fluorophore labeling did not alter the native functions 
of these MMR proteins in vitro or in singulo. Because the FGE recognition 
sequence is easily portable, FGE-HIPS fluorophore-labeling may be easily 
extended to other proteins.
