G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play important roles in cellular functions. 
However, their intracellular organization is largely unknown. Through 
investigation of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), we discovered periodically 
repeating clusters of CB1 hotspots within the axons of neurons. We observed 
these CB1 hotspots interact with the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS) 
forming a complex crucial in the regulation of CB1 signaling. Furthermore, we 
found that CB1 hotspot periodicity increased upon CB1 agonist application, and 
these activated CB1 displayed less dynamic movement compared to non-activated 
CB1. Our results suggest that CB1 forms periodic hotspots organized by the MPS 
as a mechanism to increase signaling efficacy upon activation.
