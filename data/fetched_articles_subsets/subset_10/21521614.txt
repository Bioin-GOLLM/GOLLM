Longitudinal axon fascicles within the Drosophila embryonic CNS provide 
connections between body segments and are required for coordinated neural 
signaling along the anterior-posterior axis. We show here that establishment of 
select CNS longitudinal tracts and formation of precise mechanosensory afferent 
innervation to the same CNS region are coordinately regulated by the secreted 
semaphorins Sema-2a and Sema-2b. Both Sema-2a and Sema-2b utilize the same 
neuronal receptor, plexin B (PlexB), but serve distinct guidance functions. 
Localized Sema-2b attraction promotes the initial assembly of a subset of CNS 
longitudinal projections and subsequent targeting of chordotonal sensory 
afferent axons to these same longitudinal connectives, whereas broader Sema-2a 
repulsion serves to prevent aberrant innervation. In the absence of Sema-2b or 
PlexB, chordotonal afferent connectivity within the CNS is severely disrupted, 
resulting in specific larval behavioral deficits. These results reveal that 
distinct semaphorin-mediated guidance functions converge at PlexB and are 
critical for functional neural circuit assembly.
