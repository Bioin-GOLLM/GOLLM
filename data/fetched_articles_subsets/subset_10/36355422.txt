Congenital hearing impairment (HI) is a genetically highly heterogeneous 
disorder in which prompt recognition and intervention are crucial to optimize 
outcomes. In this study, we used exome sequencing to investigate a large 
consanguineous Pakistani family with eight affected individuals showing 
bilateral severe-to-profound HI. This identified a homozygous splice region 
variant in STX4 (c.232 + 6T>C), which causes exon skipping and a frameshift, 
that segregated with HI (two-point logarithm of odds (LOD) score = 5.9). STX4, a 
member of the syntaxin family, is a component of the SNARE machinery involved in 
several vesicle transport and recycling pathways. In silico analysis showed that 
murine orthologue Stx4a is highly and widespread expressed in the developing and 
adult inner ear. Immunofluorescent imaging revealed localization of STX4A in the 
cell body, cell membrane and stereocilia of inner and outer hair cells. 
Furthermore, a morpholino-based knockdown of stx4 in zebrafish showed an 
abnormal startle response, morphological and developmental defects, and a 
disrupted mechanotransduction function in neuromast hair cells measured via 
FM1-43 uptake. Our findings indicate that STX4 dysfunction leads to HI in humans 
and zebrafish and supports the evolutionary conserved role of STX4 in inner ear 
development and hair cell functioning.
