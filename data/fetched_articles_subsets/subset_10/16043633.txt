A novel class of non-nucleoside triphosphate analogues, bearing hydrophobic 
groups sterically similar to nucleosides linked to the alpha-phosphate but 
lacking the chemical functional groups of nucleic acids, were tested against six 
different DNA polymerases (polymerases). Human polymerases alpha, beta and 
lambda, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae polymerase IV, were inhibited with 
different potencies by these analogues. On the contrary, Escherichia coli 
polymerase I and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase were not. Polymerase beta 
incorporated these derivatives in a strictly Mn++-dependent manner. On the other 
hand, polymerase lambda could incorporate some alkyltriphosphate derivatives 
with both Mg++ and Mn++, but only opposite to an abasic site on the template 
strand. The active site mutant polymerase lambda Y505A showed an increased 
ability to incorporate the analogues. These results show for the first time that 
neither the base nor the sugar moieties of nucleotides are required for 
incorporation by family X DNA polymerases.
