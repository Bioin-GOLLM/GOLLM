Ferroptosis, first introduced as a new form of regulated cell death induced by 
erastin, is accompanied by the accumulation of iron and lipid peroxides, thus it 
can be inhibited either by iron chelators or by lipophilic antioxidants. In the 
past decade, multiple studies have introduced the potential importance of 
ferroptosis in many human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative 
diseases. In this review, we will discuss the genetic association of ferroptosis 
with neurological disorders and development of the central nervous system.
