Alexander disease is a rare, fatal neurologic disorder characterized by 
white-matter degeneration and cytoplasmic inclusions in astrocytes known as 
Rosenthal fibers, which are immunohistochemically positive to glial fibrillary 
acidic protein. Mutations in the glial fibrillary acidic protein gene were 
reported in patients with Alexander disease who had clinical and pathologic 
characteristics of the disease. All reported cases manifest heterozygous 
missense mutations, except for some insertions or deletions with no frame shift. 
Our patient had a heterozygous deletion of genomic sequence 1247-1249GGG>GG in 
exon 8 of the glial fibrillary acidic protein gene, which leads to a frame shift 
changing 16 amino acids and inducing a stop codon at codon 431 of 432 codons. 
The deletion mutation induces a structural conformation change in glial 
fibrillary acidic protein and their abnormal aggregation in astrocytes. This is 
the first report of a novel deletion mutation in the glial fibrillary acidic 
protein gene with a frame shift associated with Alexander disease.
