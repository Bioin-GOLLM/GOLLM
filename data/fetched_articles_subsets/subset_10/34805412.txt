Reports indicate the increasing prevalence of liver disorders in diabetes 
mellitus (DM) patients. Clinically, it has also been revealed that the existence 
of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) enhances the incidence of type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), while T2DM exacerbates NAFLD to extremely severe forms 
of steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. This implies the 
coexistence and bidirectional nature of NAFLD and T2DM, which function 
synergistically to drive adverse consequences in clinical practice. For 
treatment of such comorbid state, though the existing practices such as 
lifestyle management, traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), and pharmaceuticals 
have offered somewhat relief, the debate continues about the optimal therapeutic 
impacts. Recent developments in the field of tissue engineering have led to a 
renewed interest in novel biomaterial alternatives such as stem cells. This 
might be attributable to their differentiation potential towards hepatic and 
pancreatic lineage. These cellular therapies could be further complemented by 
platelet-derived biomaterials, TCM formulations, or any specific drug. Based on 
these abovementioned approaches, we aimed to comprehensively analyze various 
preclinical and clinical studies from traditional to regenerative therapeutic 
approaches in managing concomitant NAFLD and T2DM.
