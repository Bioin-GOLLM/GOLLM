Anxiety is an instinct that may have developed to promote adaptive survival by 
evading unnecessary danger. However, excessive anxiety is disruptive and can be 
a basic disorder of other psychiatric diseases such as depression. The KF-1, a 
ubiquitin ligase located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), may prevent 
excessive anxiety; kf-1(-/-) mice exhibit selectively elevated anxiety-like 
behavior against light or heights. It is surmised that KF-1 degrades some target 
proteins, responsible for promoting anxiety, through the ER-associated 
degradation pathway, similar to Parkin in Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin, 
another ER-ubiquitin ligase, prevents the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons 
by degrading the target proteins responsible for PD. Molecular phylogenetic 
studies have revealed that the prototype of kf-1 appeared in the very early 
phase of animal evolution but was lost, unlike parkin, in the lineage leading up 
to Drosophila. Therefore, kf-1(-/-) mice may be a powerful tool for elucidating 
the molecular mechanisms involved in emotional regulation, and for screening 
novel anxiolytic/antidepressant compounds.
