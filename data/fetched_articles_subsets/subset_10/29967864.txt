Sepsis is an injurious systemic host response to infection, which can often lead 
to septic shock and death. Recently, the immune-pathogenesis and genomics of 
sepsis have become a research topic focusing on the establishment of diagnostic 
and prognostic biomarkers. As yet, none have been identified as having the 
necessary specificity to be used independently of other factors in this respect. 
However the accumulation of current evidence regarding genetic variations, 
especially the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of cytokines and other 
innate immunity determinants, partially explains the susceptibility and 
individual differences of patients with regard to the evolution of sepsis. This 
article outlines the role of genetic variation of some serum proteins which have 
the potential to be used as biomarker values in evaluating sepsis susceptibility 
and the progression of the condition.
