BACKGROUND: Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP) is an autosomal dominantly 
inherited disease characterized by episodic paralytic attacks with hyperkalemia, 
and is caused by mutations of the SCN4A gene encoding the skeletal muscle type 
voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.4. The pathological mechanism of HyperPP was 
suggested to be associated with gain-of-function changes for Nav1.4 gating, some 
of which are defects of slow inactivation.
CASE PRESENTATION & METHODS: We identified a HyperPP family consisting of the 
proband and his mother, who showed a novel heterozygous SCN4A variant, p.V792G, 
in an inner pore lesion of segment 6 in Domain II of Nav1.4. Clinical and 
neurophysiological evaluations were conducted for the proband and his mother. We 
explored the pathogenesis of the variant by whole-cell patch clamp technique 
using HEK293T cells expressing the mutant Nav1.4 channel.
RESULTS: Functional analysis of Nav1.4 with the V792G mutation revealed a 
hyperpolarized shift of voltage-dependent activation and fast inactivation. 
Moreover, steady-state slow inactivation in V792G was impaired with larger 
residual currents in comparison with wild-type Nav1.4.
CONCLUSION: V792G in SCN4A is a pathogenic variant associated with the HyperPP 
phenotype and the inner pore lesion of Nav1.4 plays a crucial role in slow 
inactivation.
