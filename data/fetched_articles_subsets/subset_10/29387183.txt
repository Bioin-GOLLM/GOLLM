Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to serve a key role in tumor 
progression, recurrence and metastasis. Tumorsphere culture is the most 
important method for enriching CSCs and is widely used in basic research and 
drug screening. However, the traditional suspension cell culture system has 
several disadvantages, including low efficiency, high cost and difficult 
procedure, making it difficult to produce tumorspheres on a large scale. In the 
present study, two biomaterials, methylcellulose (MC) and gellan gum (GG), were 
used to construct a novel culture system based on the traditional system. 
Subsequently, the characteristics of the novel three-dimensional (3D) culture 
system were evaluated, the design scheme was optimized, and the morphological 
and biological features of the tumorspheres cultured in this 3D system were 
compared with the traditional system. The results revealed that the tumorspheres 
cultured in the novel 3D system presented a higher seeding density and improved 
morphology, while maintaining stem-like properties. This evidence suggests that 
a simple, efficient and low-cost culture system that produces tumorspheres on a 
large scale was successfully constructed, which can be widely used in various 
aspects of stem cell research.
