OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies identified novel loci in 
PLPP3(phospholipid phosphatase 3) that associate with coronary artery disease 
risk independently of traditional risk factors. PLPP3 encodes LPP3 (lipid 
phosphate phosphatase 3), a cell-surface enzyme that can regulate the 
availability of bioactive lysophopsholipids including lysophosphatidic acid 
(LPA). The protective allele of PLPP3 increases LPP3 expression during cell 
exposure to oxidized lipids, however, the role of LPP3 in atherosclerosis 
remains unclear. Approach and Results: In this study, we sought to validate LPP3 
as a determinate of the development of atherosclerosis. In experimental models 
of atherosclerosis, LPP3 is upregulated and co-localizes with endothelial, 
smooth muscle cell, and CD68-positive cell markers. Global post-natal reductions 
in Plpp3 expression in mice substantially increase atherosclerosis, 
plaque-associated LPA, and inflammation. Although LPP3 expression increases 
during ox-LDL (oxidized low-density lipoprotein)-induced phenotypic modulation 
of bone marrow-derived macrophages, myeloid Plpp3 does not appear to regulate 
lesion formation. Rather, smooth muscle cell LPP3 expression is a critical 
regulator of atherosclerosis and LPA content in lesions. Moreover, mice with 
inherited deficiency in LPA receptor signaling are protected from experimental 
atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify a novel lipid signaling pathway that regulates 
inflammation in the context of atherosclerosis and is not related to traditional 
risk factors. Pharmacological targeting of bioactive LPP3 substrates, including 
LPA, may offer an orthogonal approach to lipid-lowering drugs for mitigation of 
coronary artery disease risk.
