The Pharmacogene Variation Consortium (PharmVar) provides nomenclature for the 
highly polymorphic human CYP2D6 gene locus. CYP2D6 genetic variation impacts the 
metabolism of numerous drugs and, thus, can impact drug efficacy and safety. 
This GeneFocus provides a comprehensive overview and summary of CYP2D6 genetic 
variation and describes how the information provided by PharmVar is utilized by 
the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics 
Implementation Consortium (CPIC).
