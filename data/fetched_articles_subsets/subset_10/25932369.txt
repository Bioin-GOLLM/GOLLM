The newly discovered extracellular death factor (EDF) is a pentapeptide with the 
sequence NNWNN in Escherichia coli. It was reported that it participated in the 
cell death process mediated by toxin-antitoxin system mazEF. Reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) are recently considered as common factors for bactericidal 
antibiotics-mediated cell death. Previous study indicated that EDF could 
scavenge hydroxyl radicals and might act as a signal molecule with dual effects, 
"death" and "survival". But the structure-activity relationship of EDF and the 
effects of EDF on the activity of antibiotics remain unclear. In the present 
study, our results indicated that tryptophan could be the key residue to the 
hydroxyl radicals-scavenging activity of EDF, and EDF could protect Escherichia 
coli from killing by bactericidal antibiotics, but not by DNA-damaging or 
bacteriostatic antibiotics. Our results could provide novel evidence to 
understand the role of EDF in drug-resistance.
