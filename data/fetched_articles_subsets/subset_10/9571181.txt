alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) regulates skin and hair 
pigmentation by modulating the activity of MSH receptor (MC1R). We have 
identified Arg151Cys variant of human MC1R in genomic DNA isolated from a person 
with red hair and light skin of type I. The Arg151Cys variant of MC1R binds to 
radio-labelled analogue of alpha-MSH with identical affinity as wild type MC1R 
but can not be stimulated to produce cyclic AMP (cAMP). The mutation Arg151Cys 
renders human MC1R completely nonfunctional, which explains the red hair, light 
skin and poor tanning ability (skin type I). This is the first report ever 
describing a nonfunctional MC1R isolated from a human subject.
