BACKGROUND: Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are important tools in 
precision medicine and for the development of targeted therapies to treat cancer 
patients. This study aimed to evaluate our precision medicine strategy that 
integrates genomic profiling and preclinical drug-screening platforms, in order 
to personalize cancer treatments using PDX models.
METHODS: We performed array-comparative genomic hybridization, microarray, and 
targeted next-generation sequencing analyses, in order to determine the 
oncogenic driver mutations. PDX cells were obtained from PDXs and subsequently 
screened in vitro with 17 targeted agents.
RESULTS: PDX tumors recapitulated the histopathologic and genetic features of 
the patient tumors. Among the samples from lung cancer patients that were 
molecularly-profiled, copy number analysis identified unique focal MET 
amplification in one sample, 033 T, without RTK/RAS/RAF oncogene mutations. 
Although HER2 amplification in 033 T was not detected in the cancer panel, the 
selection of HER2-amplified clones was found in PDXs and PDX cells. 
Additionally, MET and HER2 overexpression were found in patient tumors, PDXs, 
and PDX cells. Crizotinib or EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments 
significantly inhibited cell growth and impaired tumor sphere formation in 033 T 
PDX cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We established PDX cell models using surgical samples from lung 
cancer patients, and investigated their preclinical and clinical implications 
for personalized targeted therapy. Additionally, we suggest that MET and EGFR 
inhibitor-based therapy can be used to treat MET and HER2-overexpressing lung 
cancers, without receptor tyrosine kinase /RAS/RAF pathway alterations.
