BACKGROUND: Many patients remain without a diagnosis despite extensive medical 
evaluation. The Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) was established to apply a 
multidisciplinary model in the evaluation of the most challenging cases and to 
identify the biologic characteristics of newly discovered diseases. The UDN, 
which is funded by the National Institutes of Health, was formed in 2014 as a 
network of seven clinical sites, two sequencing cores, and a coordinating 
center. Later, a central biorepository, a metabolomics core, and a model 
organisms screening center were added.
METHODS: We evaluated patients who were referred to the UDN over a period of 20 
months. The patients were required to have an undiagnosed condition despite 
thorough evaluation by a health care provider. We determined the rate of 
diagnosis among patients who subsequently had a complete evaluation, and we 
observed the effect of diagnosis on medical care.
RESULTS: A total of 1519 patients (53% female) were referred to the UDN, of whom 
601 (40%) were accepted for evaluation. Of the accepted patients, 192 (32%) had 
previously undergone exome sequencing. Symptoms were neurologic in 40% of the 
applicants, musculoskeletal in 10%, immunologic in 7%, gastrointestinal in 7%, 
and rheumatologic in 6%. Of the 382 patients who had a complete evaluation, 132 
received a diagnosis, yielding a rate of diagnosis of 35%. A total of 15 
diagnoses (11%) were made by clinical review alone, and 98 (74%) were made by 
exome or genome sequencing. Of the diagnoses, 21% led to recommendations 
regarding changes in therapy, 37% led to changes in diagnostic testing, and 36% 
led to variant-specific genetic counseling. We defined 31 new syndromes.
CONCLUSIONS: The UDN established a diagnosis in 132 of the 382 patients who had 
a complete evaluation, yielding a rate of diagnosis of 35%. (Funded by the 
National Institutes of Health Common Fund.).
