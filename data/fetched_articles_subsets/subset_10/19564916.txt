In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rho1 
controls actin polarization and cell wall expansion. When cells are exposed to 
various environmental stresses that perturb the cell wall, Rho1 activates Pkc1, 
a mammalian Protein Kinase C homologue, and Mpk1, a mitogen activated protein 
kinase (MAPK), resulting in actin depolarization and cell wall remodeling. In 
this study, we demonstrate a novel feedback loop in this Rho1-mediated Pkc1-MAPK 
pathway that involves regulation of Rom2, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor 
of Rho1, by Mpk1, the end kinase of the pathway. This previously unrecognized 
Mpk1-dependent feedback is a critical step in regulating Rho1 function. 
Activation of this feedback mechanism is responsible for redistribution of Rom2 
and cell wall synthesis activity from the bud to cell periphery under stress 
conditions. It is also required for terminating Rho1 activity toward the 
Pkc1-MAPK pathway and for repolarizing actin cytoskeleton and restoring growth 
after the stressed cells become adapted.
