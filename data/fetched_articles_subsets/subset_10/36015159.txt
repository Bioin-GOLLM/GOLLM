The presence of antimicrobial-resistance genes (ARGs) in mobile genetic elements 
(MGEs) facilitates the rapid development and dissemination of 
multidrug-resistant bacteria, which represents a serious problem for human 
health. This is a One Health study which aims to investigate the co-occurrence 
of antimicrobial resistance determinants among clinical and environmental 
isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Various bioinformatics tools were used to 
elucidate the bacterial strains' ID, resistome, virulome, MGEs, and phylogeny 
for 42 isolates obtained from hospitalized patients (n = 20) and environmental 
sites (including fresh vegetables, fruits, and drinking water) (n = 22). The 
multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed that K. pneumoniae belonged to ten 
sequence types (STs) while the E. coli belonged to seventeen STs. 
Multidrug-resistant isolates harbored β-lactam, aminoglycoside resistance 
determinants, and MGE were detected circulating in the environment (drinking 
water, fresh vegetables, and fruits) and in patients hospitalized with 
postoperative infections, neonatal sepsis, and urinary tract infection. Four K. 
pneumoniae environmental isolates (7E, 16EE, 1KE, and 19KE) were 
multidrug-resistant and were positive for different beta-lactam and 
aminoglycoside resistance determinants. blaCTX-M-15 in brackets of ISEc 9 and Tn 
3 transposases was detected in isolates circulating in the pediatrics unit of 
Soba hospital and the environment. This study documented the presence of 
bacterial isolates harboring a similar pattern of antimicrobial resistance 
determinants circulating in hospitals and environments. A rapid response is 
needed from stakeholders to initiate a program for infection prevention and 
control measures to detect such clones disseminated in the communities and 
hospitals.
