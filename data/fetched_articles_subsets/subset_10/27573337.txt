The refractive index is the fundamental property of all optical materials and 
dictates Snell's law, propagation speed, wavelength, diffraction, energy 
density, absorption and emission of light in materials. Experimentally realized 
broadband refractive indices remain <40, even with intricately designed 
artificial media. Herein, we demonstrate a measured index >1,800 resulting from 
a mesoscopic crystal with a dielectric constant greater than three million. This 
gigantic enhancement effect originates from the space-filling curve concept from 
mathematics. The principle is inherently very broad band, the enhancement being 
nearly constant from zero up to the frequency of interest. This broadband 
giant-refractive-index medium promises not only enhanced resolution in imaging 
and raised fundamental absorption limits in solar energy devices, but also 
compact, power-efficient components for optical communication and increased 
performance in many other applications.
