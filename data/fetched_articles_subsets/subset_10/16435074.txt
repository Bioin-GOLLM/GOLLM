A pathogenic mutation in the BRCA2 gene, nt7602del16, has been misquoted as a 
mutation, possibly due to the incorrect inclusion of the last 16 nucleotides of 
exon15 of the BRCA2 gene as part of the intron15-exon16 BRCA2 gene sequence in 
publicly available databases. This was concluded following mutational screening 
by sequencing and enzymatic mapping of the BRCA2 gene exon15-exon16 region in 
DNA from peripheral blood samples from a total of 74 breast cancer and 
non-breast cancer patients as well as healthy individuals and the cell line 
MCF7. Careful interpretation of genetic variants and direct feedback to the 
corresponding sequence databases prevent systemic errors by integrating updated 
data into broadly referenced sources.
