RUNX proteins are highly conserved in metazoans and perform critical functions 
during development. Dysregulation of RUNX proteins through various molecular 
mechanisms facilitates the development and progression of various cancers, where 
different RUNX proteins show tumor type-specific functions and regulate 
different aspects of tumorigenesis by cross-talking with different signaling 
pathways such as Wnt, TGF-Î², and Hippo. Molecularly, they could serve as 
transcription factors (TFs) to activate their direct target genes or interact 
with many other TFs to modulate chromatin architecture globally. Here, we review 
the current knowledge on the functions and regulations of RUNX proteins in 
different cancer types and highlight their potential role as epigenetic 
modulators in cancer.
