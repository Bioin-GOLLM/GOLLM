We hypothesized that the mitogenome of Gammarus lacustris (GL), native to the 
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, might exhibit genetic adaptations to the extreme 
environmental conditions associated with high altitudes (greater than 3000 m). 
To test this, we also sequenced the mitogenome of Gammarus pisinnus (GP), whose 
native range is close to the Tibetan plateau, but at a much lower altitude 
(200-1500 m). The two mitogenomes exhibited conserved mitochondrial 
architecture, but low identity between genes (55% atp8 to 76.1% cox1). Standard 
(homogeneous) phylogenetic models resolved Gammaridae as paraphyletic, but 
'heterogeneous' CAT-GTR model as monophyletic. In indirect support of our 
working hypothesis, GL, GP and Gammarus fossarum exhibit evidence of episodic 
diversifying selection within the studied Gammaroidea dataset. The mitogenome of 
GL generally evolves under a strong purifying selection, whereas GP evolves 
under directional (especially pronounced in atp8) and/or relaxed selection. This 
is surprising, as GP does not inhabit a unique ecological niche compared to 
other gammarids. We propose that this rapid evolution of the GP mitogenome may 
be a reflection of its relatively recent speciation and heightened non-adaptive 
(putatively metabolic rate-driven) mutational pressures. To test these 
hypotheses, we urge sequencing mitogenomes of remaining Gammarus species 
populating the same geographical range as GP.
