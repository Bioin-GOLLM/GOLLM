Target RNA binding to crRNA-bound type III-A CRISPR-Cas multi-subunit Csm 
surveillance complexes activates cyclic-oligoadenylate (cAn) formation from ATP 
subunits positioned within the composite pair of Palm domain pockets of the Csm1 
subunit. The generated cAn second messenger in turn targets the CARF domain of 
trans-acting RNase Csm6, triggering its HEPN domain-based RNase activity. We 
have undertaken cryo-EM studies on multi-subunit Thermococcus onnurineus Csm 
effector ternary complexes, as well as X-ray studies on Csm1-Csm4 cassette, both 
bound to substrate (AMPPNP), intermediates (pppAn), and products (cAn), to 
decipher mechanistic aspects of cAn formation and release. A network of 
intermolecular hydrogen bond alignments accounts for the observed adenosine 
specificity, with ligand positioning dictating formation of linear pppAn 
intermediates and subsequent cAn formation by cyclization. We combine our 
structural results with published functional studies to highlight mechanistic 
insights into the role of the Csm effector complex in mediating the cAn 
signaling pathway.
