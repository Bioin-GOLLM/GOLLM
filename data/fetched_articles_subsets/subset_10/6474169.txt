Activation of a c-K-ras oncogene by somatic mutation in mouse lymphomas induced 
by gamma radiation.

Guerrero I, Villasante A, Corces V, Pellicer A.

Mouse tumors induced by gamma radiation are a useful model system for 
oncogenesis. DNA from such tumors contains an activated K-ras oncogene that can 
transform NIH 3T3 cells. This report describes the cloning of a fragment of the 
mouse K-ras oncogene containing the first exon from both a transformant in rat-2 
cells and the brain of the same mouse that developed the tumor. Hybrid 
constructs containing one of the two pieces were made and only the plasmid 
including the first exon from the transformant gave rise to foci in NIH 3T3 
cells. There was only a single base difference (G----A) in the exonic sequence, 
which changed glycine to aspartic acid in the transformant. By use of a 
synthetic oligonucleotide the presence of the mutation was demonstrated in the 
original tumor, ruling out modifications during DNA-mediated gene transfer and 
indicating that the alteration was present in the thymic lymphoma but absent 
from other nonmalignant tissue. The results are compatible with gamma radiation 
being a source of point mutations.
