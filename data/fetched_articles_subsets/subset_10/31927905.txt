A novel ultrasensitive nanobody-based electrochemical immunoassay was prepared 
for assessing human exposure to pyrethroid insecticides. 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid 
(3-PBA) is a common human urinary metabolite for numerous pyrethroids, which 
broadly served as a biomarker for following the human exposure to this pesticide 
group. The 3-PBA detection was via a direct competition for binding to alkaline 
phosphatase-embedded nanobodies between free 3-PBA and a 3-PBA-bovine serum 
albumin conjugate covalently immobilized onto citric acid-decorated nylon 
nanofibers, which were incorporated on a screen-printed electrode (SPE). 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to support the 
advantage of the employment of nanofibrous membranes and the success of the 
immunosensor assembly. The coupling between the nanofiber and nanobody 
technologies provided an ultrasensitive and selective immunosensor for 3-PBA 
detection in the range of 0.8 to 1000 pg mL-1 with a detection limit of 0.64 pg 
mL-1. Moreover, when the test for 3-PBA was applied to real samples, the 
established immunosensor proved to be a viable alternative to the conventional 
methods for 3-PBA detection in human urine even without sample cleanup. It 
showed excellent properties and stability over time.
