The interaction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with their direct 
neighboring cells in the bone marrow (the so called hematopoietic niche) evolves 
as a key principle for understanding physiological and malignant hematopoiesis. 
Significant progress in this matter has recently been achieved making use of 
emerging high-throughput techniques that allow characterization of the bone 
marrow microenvironment at single cell resolution. This review aims to discuss 
these single cell findings in the light of other conventional niche studies that 
together define the current notion of the niche's implication in i) normal 
hematopoiesis, ii) myeloid neoplasms and iii) disease-driving pathways that can 
be exploited to establish novel therapeutic strategies in the future.
