The bovine growth hormone receptor (GHR) gene has been identified as a strong 
positional and functional candidate gene influencing milk production. A 
non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 8 leads to a 
phenylalanine to tyrosine amino acid substitution (F279Y) in the receptor. The 
aim of the study was to estimate the effects of the F279Y mutation on milk 
yield, fat, protein, casein, and lactose yield and content, as well as somatic 
cell score (SCS), in a German Holstein dairy cattle population. The analysis of 
1,370 dairy cows confirmed a strong association of the F279Y polymorphism with 
milk yield, as well as with fat, protein, and casein contents. Furthermore, 
increasing effects on lactose yield and content for the 279Y allele were found. 
Even though the tyrosine variant occurred as the minor allele (16.5%), its 
substitution effects were 320 kg (305 d), 0.02 kg per day, and 0.07 kg per day 
for milk, casein, and lactose yields, respectively. The same allele had negative 
effects on fat, protein, and casein contents. Finally, the high-milk-yield 
tyrosine allele was also associated with lower SCS (p < 0.05). The data support 
the high potential of the F279Y polymorphism as a marker for the improvement of 
milk traits in selection programs.
