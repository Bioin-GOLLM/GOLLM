Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common of congenital cardiovascular 
malformations associated with birth defects, and it results in significant 
morbidity and mortality worldwide. The classification of CHD is still elusive 
owing to the complex pathogenesis of CHD. Advances in molecular medicine have 
revealed the genetic basis of some heart anomalies. Genes associated with CHD 
might be modulated by various epigenetic factors. Thus, the genetic and 
epigenetic factors are gradually accepted as important triggers in the 
pathogenesis of CHD. However, few literatures have comprehensively elaborated 
the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of CHD. This review focuses on the 
etiology of CHD from genetics and epigenetics to discuss the role of these 
factors in the development of CHD. The interactions between genetic and 
epigenetic in the pathogenesis of CHD are also elaborated. Chromosome 
abnormalities and gene mutations in genetics, and DNA methylations, histone 
modifications and on-coding RNAs in epigenetics are summarized in detail. We 
hope the summative knowledge of these etiologies may be useful for improved 
diagnosis and further elucidation of CHD so that morbidity and mortality of 
children with CHD can be reduced in the near future.
