DksA is an auxiliary transcription factor that interacts with RNA polymerase and 
influences gene expression. Depending on the promoter, DksA can be a positive or 
negative regulator of transcription initiation. Moreover, DksA has a substantial 
effect on transcription elongation where it prevents the collision of 
transcription and replication machineries, plays a key role in maintaining 
transcription elongation when translation and transcription are uncoupled and 
has been shown to be involved in transcription fidelity. Here, we assessed the 
role of DksA in transcription fidelity by monitoring stochastic epigenetic 
switching in the lac operon (with and without an error-prone transcription 
slippage sequence), partial phenotypic suppression of a lacZ nonsense allele, as 
well as monitoring the number of lacI mRNA transcripts produced in the presence 
and absence of DksA via an operon fusion and single molecule fluorescent in situ 
hybridization studies. We present data showing that DksA acts to maintain 
transcription fidelity in vivo and the role of DksA seems to be distinct from 
that of the GreA and GreB transcription fidelity factors.
