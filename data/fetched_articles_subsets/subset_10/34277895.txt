OBJECTIVES: Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous condition mainly 
characterised by bone fragility; extra-skeletal features in OI include blue 
sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta, skin laxity and joint hyper-extensibility. 
Most patients with OI are thought to have a low bone mass but contrary to 
expectations there are certain forms of OI with high bone mass which this study 
explores in further detail.
METHOD: A cohort of n = 6 individuals with pathogenic variants in BMP1 and the 
C-propeptide cleavage variants in COL1A1 were included in this study. Detailed 
clinical and radiological phenotyping was done and correlated with genotype to 
identify patterns of clinical presentation and fracture history in this cohort 
of patients. This data was compared to previously reported literature in this 
group.
RESULTS: 2 patients with BMP1 and 4 patients with pathogenic variants in 
C-propeptide region in COL1A1 were deep-phenotyped as part of this study and 1 
patient with C-propeptide variant in COL1A1, showed low bone mineral density. In 
those with an elevated bone mineral density, this became even more apparent on 
bisphosphonate therapy. Patients in this cohort had variable clinical 
presentation ranging from antenatal presentation to more of an insidious course 
resulting in later confirmation of genetic diagnosis up to 19 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pathogenic variants in the C-propeptide region of 
COL1A1/A2 and BMP1 appear to have a high bone mass phenotype with increased 
sensitivity to bisphosphonate therapy. It is important to closely monitor 
patients with these genotypes to assess their response to therapy and tailor 
their treatment regime accordingly.
