Chemical matter is needed to target the divergent biology associated with the 
different life cycle stages of Plasmodium. Here, we report the parallel de novo 
screening of the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) Pandemic Response Box 
against Plasmodium asexual and liver stage parasites, stage IV/V gametocytes, 
gametes, oocysts and as endectocides. Unique chemotypes were identified with 
both multistage activity or stage-specific activity, including structurally 
diverse gametocyte-targeted compounds with potent transmission-blocking 
activity, such as the JmjC inhibitor ML324 and the antitubercular clinical 
candidate SQ109. Mechanistic investigations prove that ML324 prevents histone 
demethylation, resulting in aberrant gene expression and death in gametocytes. 
Moreover, the selection of parasites resistant to SQ109 implicates the druggable 
V-type H+-ATPase for the reduced sensitivity. Our data therefore provides an 
expansive dataset of compounds that could be redirected for antimalarial 
development and also point towards proteins that can be targeted in multiple 
parasite life cycle stages.
