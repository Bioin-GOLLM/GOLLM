BACKGROUND: Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) is one of the major etiological agents of 
hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). This study aimed to investigate the 
molecular epidemiology and evolutionary characteristics of CVA16.
METHODS: Throat swabs were collected from children with HFMD and suspected HFMD 
during 2010-2019. Enteroviruses (EVs) were detected and typed by real-time 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RT-PCR. The 
genotype, evolutionary rate, the most recent common ancestor, population 
dynamics and selection pressure of CVA16 were analyzed based on viral protein 
gene (VP1) by bioinformatics software.
RESULTS: A total of 4709 throat swabs were screened. EVs were detected in 3180 
samples and 814 were CVA16 positive. More than 81% of CVA16-positive children 
were under 5 years old. The prevalence of CVA16 showed obvious periodic 
fluctuations with a high level during 2010-2012 followed by an apparent decline 
during 2013-2017. However, the activities of CVA16 increased gradually during 
2018-2019. All the Beijing CVA16 strains belonged to sub-genotype B1, and B1b 
was the dominant strain. One B1c strain was detected in Beijing for the first 
time in 2016. The estimated mean evolutionary rate of VP1 gene was 4.49 × 10-3 
substitution/site/year. Methionine gradually fixed at site-23 of VP1 since 2012. 
Two sites were detected under episodic positive selection, one of which 
(site-223) located in neutralizing linear epitope PEP71.
CONCLUSIONS: The dominant strains of CVA16 belonged to clade B1b and evolved in 
a fast evolutionary rate during 2010-2019 in Beijing. To provide more favorable 
data for HFMD prevention and control, it is necessary to keep attention on 
molecular epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of CVA16.
