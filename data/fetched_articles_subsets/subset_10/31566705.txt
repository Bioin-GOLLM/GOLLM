Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women. 
The most important risk factor for the development of CC is cervical infection 
with human papilloma virus (HPV). Inflammation is a protective strategy that is 
triggered by the host against pathogens such as viral infections that acts 
rapidly to activate the innate immune response. Inflammation is beneficial if it 
is brief and well controlled; however, if the inflammation is excessive or it 
becomes of chronic duration, it can produce detrimental effects. HPV proteins 
are involved, both directly and indirectly, in the development of chronic 
inflammation, which is a causal factor in the development of CC. However, other 
factors may also have a potential role in stimulating chronic inflammation. 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) (a class of noncoding RNAs) are strong regulators of gene 
expression. They have emerged as key players in several biological processes, 
including inflammatory pathways. Abnormal expression of miRNAs may be linked to 
the induction of inflammation that occurs in CC. Exosomes are a subset of 
extracellular vesicles shed by almost all types of cells, which can function as 
cargo transfer vehicles. Exosomes contain proteins and genetic material 
(including miRNAs) derived from their parent cells and can potentially affect 
recipient cells. Exosomes have recently been recognized to be involved in 
inflammatory processes and can also affect the immune response. In this review, 
we discuss the role of HPV proteins, miRNAs and exosomes in the inflammation 
associated with CC.
