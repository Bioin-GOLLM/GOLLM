Ceramide transfer protein (CERT) functions in the transfer of ceramide from the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. In this study, we show that CERT is an 
essential gene for mouse development and embryonic survival and, quite 
strikingly, is critical for mitochondrial integrity. CERT mutant embryos 
accumulate ceramide in the ER but also mislocalize ceramide to the mitochondria, 
compromising their function. Cells in mutant embryos show abnormal dilation of 
the ER and degenerating mitochondria. These subcellular changes manifest as 
heart defects and cause severely compromised cardiac function and embryonic 
death around embryonic day 11.5. In spite of ceramide accumulation, CERT mutant 
mice do not die as a result of enhanced apoptosis. Instead, cell proliferation 
is impaired, and expression levels of cell cycle-associated proteins are 
altered. Individual cells survive, perhaps because cell survival mechanisms are 
activated. Thus, global compromise of ER and mitochondrial integrity caused by 
ceramide accumulation in CERT mutant mice primarily affects organogenesis rather 
than causing cell death via apoptotic pathways.
