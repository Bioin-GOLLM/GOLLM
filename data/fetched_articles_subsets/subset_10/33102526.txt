The growth of expertise in molecular techniques, their application to clinical 
evaluations, and the establishment of databases with molecular genetic 
information has led to greater insights into the roles of molecular processes 
related to gene expression in neurodevelopment and functioning. The goal of this 
review is to examine new insights into messenger RNA transcription, translation, 
and cellular protein synthesis and the relevance of genetically determined 
alterations in these processes in neurodevelopmental, cognitive, and behavioral 
disorders.
