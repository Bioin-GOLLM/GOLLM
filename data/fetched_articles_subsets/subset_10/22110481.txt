INTRODUCTION: Diabetics die from cardiovascular disease at a much greater rate 
than nondiabetics. Cardiac autonomic imbalance predicts increased cardiovascular 
risk and mortality. We studied the relationship between cardiac autonomic 
imbalance and adipose tissue-derived inflammation in newly diagnosed and 
established type 2 diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-diabetics, newly diagnosed diabetics, and established 
diabetics were included. Anthropomorphic and biochemical measurements were 
obtained, and insulin resistance was approximated. Cardiac autonomic function 
was assessed using conventional measures and with power spectral analysis of 
heart rate.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Heart rate variability was reduced in all diabetics. 
Interleukin-6 was higher in diabetics, as was the high molecular weight 
adiponectin-to-leptin ratio. Interleukin-6 correlated negatively with measures 
of autonomic balance. Ratios of adiponectin to leptin correlated positively with 
measures of autonomic balance. Cardiac autonomic imbalance and inflammation 
occur early in diabetes and are interrelated.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac autonomic imbalance correlates with the adipose 
tissue-derived inflammation seen early in type 2 diabetes.
