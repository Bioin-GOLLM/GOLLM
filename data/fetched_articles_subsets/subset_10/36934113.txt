Resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies in melanoma is common and 
remains an intractable clinical challenge. In this study, we comprehensively 
profile immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance mechanisms in short-term tumor 
cell lines and matched tumor samples from melanoma patients progressing on 
immune checkpoint inhibitors. Combining genome, transcriptome, and high 
dimensional flow cytometric profiling with functional analysis, we identify 
three distinct programs of immunotherapy resistance. Here we show that 
resistance programs include (1) the loss of wild-type antigen expression, 
resulting from tumor-intrinsic IFNγ signaling and melanoma de-differentiation, 
(2) the disruption of antigen presentation via multiple independent mechanisms 
affecting MHC expression, and (3) immune cell exclusion associated with PTEN 
loss. The dominant role of compromised antigen production and presentation in 
melanoma resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition highlights the importance of 
treatment salvage strategies aimed at the restoration of MHC expression, 
stimulation of innate immunity, and re-expression of wild-type differentiation 
antigens.
