Neointimal hyperplasia is a product of VSMC replication and consequent 
accumulation within the blood vessel wall. In this study, we determined whether 
inhibition of protein kinase CK2 and the resultant stabilisation of proline-rich 
homeodomain (PRH) could suppress VSMC proliferation. Both silencing and 
pharmacological inhibition of CK2 with K66 antagonised replication of isolated 
VSMCs. SiRNA-induced knockdown as well as ectopic overexpression of proline-rich 
homeodomain indicated that PRH disrupts cell cycle progression. Mutation of CK2 
phosphorylation sites Ser163 and Ser177 within the PRH homeodomain enabled 
prolonged cell cycle arrest by PRH. Concomitant knockdown of PRH and inhibition 
of CK2 with K66 indicated that the anti-proliferative action of K66 required the 
presence of PRH. Both K66 and adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of S163C:S177C 
PRH impaired neointima formation in human saphenous vein organ cultures. 
Importantly, neither intervention had notable effects on cell cycle progression, 
cell survival or migration in cultured endothelial cells.
