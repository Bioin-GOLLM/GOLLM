Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is an autosomal dominant 
hereditary disorder characterized by severe polydipsia and polyuria that usually 
presents in early childhood. In this study, we describe a new arginine 
vasopressin (AVP) gene mutation in an ethnic German family with FNDI and provide 
an overview of disease-associated AVP-gene mutations that are already described 
in literature. Three members of a German family with neurohypophyseal diabetes 
insipidus were studied. Isolated DNA from peripheral blood samples was used for 
mutation analysis by sequencing the whole coding region of AVP-NPII gene. 
Furthermore, we searched the electronic databases MEDLINE (Pubmed) as well as 
HGMD, LOVD-ClinVar, db-SNP and genomAD in order to compare our cases to that of 
other patients with FNDI. Genetic analysis of the patients revealed a novel 
heterozygote missense mutation in exon 2 of the AVP gene (c.274T>G), which has 
not yet been described in literature. We identified reports of more than 90 
disease-associated mutations in the AVP gene in literature. The novel mutation 
of the AVP gene seems to cause FNDI in the presented German family. Similar to 
our newly detected mutation, most mutations causing FNDI are found in exon 2 of 
the AVP gene coding for neurophysin II. Clinically, it is important to think of 
FNDI in young children presenting with polydipsia and polyuria.
