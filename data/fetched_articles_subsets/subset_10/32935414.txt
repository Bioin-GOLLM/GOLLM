In hemophilia A and B, analysis of the F8 and F9 gene variants enables carrier 
and prenatal diagnosis and prediction of risk for the development of inhibitors. 
The PedNet Registry collects clinical, genetic, and phenotypic data 
prospectively on more than 2000 children with hemophilia. The genetic reports of 
F8/F9 gene variants were classified uniformly to Human Genome Variation Society 
nomenclature and reevaluated using international population- and 
disease-specific databases, literature survey and, where applicable, 
computational predictive programs. We report 88 novel variants in the F8 and F9 
genes, 80 fulfilling criteria for Class 5 (pathogenic), six for Class 4 (likely 
pathogenic) and two fulfilling criteria for Class 3 (variant of unknown 
significance) of the American College of Medical Genetics and 
Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathologyguidelines together with information 
on the respective phenotype and inhibitor formation. The study highlights the 
need to reevaluate and update earlier genetic reports in hemophilia both locally 
but also in variant databases in light of changed nomenclature and new 
guidelines.
