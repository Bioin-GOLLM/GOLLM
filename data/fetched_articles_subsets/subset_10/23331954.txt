Small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) are involved in a variety of biological 
and pathological processes. This review focuses on their regulatory roles in 
matrix assembly. SLRPs have protein cores and hypervariable glycosylation with 
multivalent binding abilities. During development, differential interactions of 
SLRPs with other molecules result in tissue-specific spatial and temporal 
distributions. The changing expression patterns play a critical role in the 
regulation of tissue-specific matrix assembly and therefore tissue function. 
SLRPs play significant structural roles within extracellular matrices. In 
addition, they play regulatory roles in collagen fibril growth, fibril 
organization and extracellular matrix assembly. Moreover, they are involved in 
mediating cell-matrix interactions. Abnormal SLRP expression and/or structures 
result in dysfunctional extracellular matrices and pathophysiology. Altered 
expression of SLRPs has been found in many disease models, and structural 
deficiency also causes altered matrix assembly. SLRPs regulate assembly of the 
extracellular matrix, which defines the microenvironment, modulating both the 
extracellular matrix and cellular functions, with an impact on tissue function.
