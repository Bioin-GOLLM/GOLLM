Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a malignancy derived from the 
calcitonin-producing C-cells of the thyroid gland. Oncogenic mutations of the 
Ret proto-oncogene are found in all heritable forms of MTC and roughly one half 
of the sporadic cases. However, several lines of evidence argue for the 
existence of additional genetic lesions necessary for the development of MTC. 
Sprouty (Spry) family of genes is composed of four members in mammals (Spry1-4). 
Some Spry family members have been proposed as candidate tumor-suppressor genes 
in a variety of cancerous pathologies. In this work, we show that targeted 
deletion of Spry1 causes C-cell hyperplasia, a precancerous lesion preceding 
MTC, in young adult mice. Expression of Spry1 restrains proliferation of the 
MTC-derived cell line, TT. Finally, we found that the Spry1 promoter is 
frequently methylated in MTC and that Spry1 expression is consequently 
decreased. These findings identify Spry1 as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in 
MTC.
