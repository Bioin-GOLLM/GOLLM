BACKGROUND: Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin have been 
shown to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as myocardial infarction, 
stroke, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD).
METHODS: Two mutations, S128R in E-selectin and K469E in ICAM-1, were 
investigated in 156 patients with PAOD and 100 control subjects using polymerase 
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis in 
an Egyptian population.
RESULTS: The distribution of E-selectin genotypes in patients affected by PAOD 
was 84.6% for the AA genotype and 15.4% for the AC genotype. In the control arm 
the distribution was 97% for the AA genotype and 3% for the AC genotype. There 
was a statistically significance difference in the distribution of the AC 
genotype in PAOD patients when compared with the control subjects. Additionally, 
the distribution of ICAM-1 genotypes in patients affected by PAOD was 30.8% with 
the EE, 48% with the EK, and 21.2% with the KK genotypes. The distribution of 
ICAM-1 genotypes in control subjects was 13% EE, 33% EK and 54% KK. The EE 
genotype was significantly more common in PAOD patients than in the controls.
CONCLUSION: S128R and K469E polymorphisms were associated with increased risk in 
PAOD. Early detection of these polymorphic genes helps in early prophylaxis 
against PAOD.
