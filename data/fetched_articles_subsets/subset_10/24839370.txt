Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a rare disease grouped under World health 
organization classification as chronic myeloproliferative disease. It is a 
diagnosis of exclusion in patients with sustained mature neutrophilia and 
splenomegaly with no evidence of other myeloproliferative disease or reactive 
neutrophilia. V617F JAK 2 mutation has been described in classical 
myeloproliferative diseases, but its association with CNL has been reported in a 
few cases. Here in, we describe three cases of CNL with presence of V617F JAK 2 
mutation. To distinguish CNL from secondary neutrophilia can be difficult. 
Detection of the V617F JAK 2 mutation in such scenario can provide a useful 
diagnostic test to establish the neoplastic nature of the neutrophilia.
