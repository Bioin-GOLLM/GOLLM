BACKGROUND AND AIMS: People with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) are at increased risks of cognitive impairment. We aimed to investigate 
the association of plasma ghrelin levels and ghrelin rs4684677 polymorphism with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in T2DM patients.
RESULTS: In addition to elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood 
glucose (FBG) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 
T2DM patients with MCI had decreased plasma ghrelin levels compared with their 
healthy-cognition subjects (all p < 0.05). Further logistic regression analysis 
showed that ghrelin level was one of independent factors for MCI in T2DM 
patients (p < 0.05). Moreover, partial correlation analysis demonstrated that 
ghrelin levels were positively associated with the scores of Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (r = 0.196, p = 0.041) and Auditory Verbal Learning Test-delayed 
recall (r = 0.197, p = 0.040) after adjustment for HbA1c, FBG and HOMA-IR, 
wherein the latter represented episodic memory functions. No significant 
differences were found for the distributions of genotype and allele of ghrelin 
rs4684677 polymorphism between MCI and control group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 218 T2DM patients, with 112 patients who 
satisfied the MCI diagnostic criteria and 106 who exhibited healthy cognition, 
were enrolled in this study. Demographic characteristics, clinical variables and 
cognitive performances were extensively assessed. Plasma ghrelin levels and 
ghrelin rs4684677 polymorphism were also determined.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that decreased ghrelin levels are associated 
with MCI, especially with episodic memory dysfunction in T2DM populations.
