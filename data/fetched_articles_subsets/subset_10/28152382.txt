Next-generation sequencing has expanded our understanding of the viral 
populations that constitute the mammalian virome. We describe a novel taxon of 
viruses named Statoviruses, for Stool associated Tombus-like viruses, present in 
multiple metagenomic datasets. These viruses define a novel clade that is 
phylogenetically related to the RNA virus families Tombusviridae and 
Flaviviridae. Five distinct statovirus types were identified in human, macaque, 
mouse, and cow gastrointestinal tract samples. The prototype genome, statovirus 
A, was frequently identified in macaque stool samples from multiple 
geographically distinct cohorts. Another genome, statovirus C1, was discovered 
in a stool sample from a human child with fever, cough, and rash. Further 
experimental data will clarify whether these viruses are infectious to mammals 
or if they originate from another source present in the mammalian 
gastrointestinal tract.
