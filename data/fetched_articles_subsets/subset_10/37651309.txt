High-grade gliomas represent the most common group of infiltrative primary brain 
tumors in adults associated with high invasiveness, agressivity, and resistance 
to therapy, which highlights the need to develop potent drugs with novel 
mechanisms of action. The aim of this study is to reveal changes in proteome 
profiles under stressful conditions to identify prognostic biomarkers and 
altered apoptogenic pathways involved in the anticancer action of human 
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant high-grade gliomas. Our protocol consists 
first of a 3D in vitro developing neurospheroid model and then treatment by a 
pesticide mixture at relevant concentrations. Furthermore, we adopted an 
untargeted proteomic-based approach with high-resolution mass spectrometry for a 
comparative analysis of the differentially expressed proteins between treated 
and nontreated spheroids. Our analysis revealed that the majority of altered 
proteins were key members in glioma pathogenesis, implicated in the cellular 
metabolism, biological regulation, binding, and catalytic and structural 
activity and linked to many cascading regulatory pathways. Our finding revealed 
that grade-IV astrocytomas promote the downstream of the 
mitogen-activated-protein-kinases/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 
(MAPK1/ERK2) pathway involving massive calcium influx. The 
gonadotrophin-releasing-hormone signaling enhances MAKP activity and may serve 
as a negative feedback compensating regulator. Thus, our study can pave the way 
for effective new therapeutic and diagnostic strategies to improve the overall 
survival.
