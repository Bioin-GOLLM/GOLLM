The use of zonal centrifugation to study membrane formation during the life 
cycle of mammalian cells. Synthesis of 'marker' enzymes and other components of 
cellular organelles.

1. The activity of enzymes characteristic of microsomes (NADPH-cytochrome c 
reductase and uridine diphosphatase) and of inner mitochondrial membranes 
(cytochrome c oxidase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase) increases during the 
cell cycle of P815Y neoplastic mast cells in concert with total protein. The 
activity of glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the mitochondrial matrix, 
increases in a somewhat different manner. 2. The specific activity of 
mitochondrial structures involved in energy-coupling measured with a fluorescent 
probe remains constant during the cell cycle. 3. Mitochondrial and microsomal 
protein increases during the cycle at the same time as total protein; nuclear 
protein increases rather more sharply. 4. The rate of incorporation of labelled 
choline or inositol into nuclear, mitochondrial or microsomal phospholipid 
during the cell cycle follows the rate of incorporation into total phospholipid. 
5. It is concluded that the major components of cellular membranes are 
synthesized, like total protein or phospholipid, throughout most of the 
intermitotic period.
