The KCNH family comprises the ERG, EAG, and ELK voltage-activated, 
potassium-selective channels. Distinct from other K channels, KCNH channels 
contain unique structural domains, including a PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain in the 
N-terminal region and a CNBHD (cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain) in the 
C-terminal region. The intracellular PAS domains and CNBHDs interact directly 
and regulate some of the characteristic gating properties of each type of KCNH 
channel. The PAS-CNBHD interaction regulates slow closing (deactivation) of hERG 
channels, the kinetics of activation and pre-pulse dependent population of 
closed states (the Cole-Moore shift) in EAG channels and voltage-dependent 
potentiation in ELK channels. KCNH channels are all regulated by an intrinsic 
ligand motif in the C-terminal region which binds to the CNBHD. Here, we focus 
on some recent advances regarding the PAS-CNBHD interaction and the intrinsic 
ligand.
