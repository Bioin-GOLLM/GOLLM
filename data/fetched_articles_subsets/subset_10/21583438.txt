4-Hydrazino-1-methyl-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine.

The title compound, C(6)H(8)N(6), crystallizes as an N-H⋯N hydrogen-bond-linked 
dimer of two almost identical mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit. Both of the 
mol-ecules are almost planar (rms deviations of 0.0186 and 0.0296 Å in the two 
molecules) and their hydrazino groups are turned towards the pyrazole rings. The 
dimers are arranged into chains via inter-molecular N-H⋯N hydrogen bonds between 
the hydrazino groups and the N atoms of the pyrimidine rings of both types of 
the mol-ecules, linking the mol-ecules into a C(7) graph-set motif along [100]. 
The methyl groups and the N atoms of the pyrazole rings form weak C-H⋯N hydrogen 
bonds, which connect chains of the dimers in a C(4) motif parallel to [100].
