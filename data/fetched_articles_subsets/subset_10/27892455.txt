Maintenance of a regular chromatin structure over the coding regions of genes 
occurs co-transcriptionally via the 'chromatin resetting' pathway. One of the 
central players in this pathway is the histone methyltransferase Set2. Here we 
show that the loss of Set2 in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, results in 
transcription initiation of antisense RNAs embedded within body of 
protein-coding genes. These RNAs are distinct from the previously identified 
non-coding RNAs and cover 11% of the yeast genome. These RNA species have been 
named Set2-repressed antisense transcripts (SRATs) since the co-transcriptional 
addition of the H3K36 methyl mark by Set2 over their start sites results in 
their suppression. Interestingly, loss of chromatin resetting factor Set2 or the 
subsequent production of SRATs does not affect the abundance of the sense 
transcripts. This difference in transcriptional outcomes of overlapping 
transcripts due to a strand-independent addition of H3K36 methylation is a key 
regulatory feature of interleaved transcriptomes.
