Protozoan parasites are responsible for several harmful and widespread human 
diseases that cause high morbidity and mortality. Currently available treatments 
have serious limitations due to poor efficiency, strong adverse effects, and 
high cost. Hence, the identification of new targets and the development of 
specific drug therapies against parasitic diseases are urgent needs. Heat shock 
protein 90 (HSP90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that plays a key role 
in parasite survival during the various differentiation stages, spread over the 
vector insect and the human host, which they undergo during their life cycle. 
The N-terminal domain (NTD) of HSP90, containing the main determinants for 
ATPase activity, represents the most druggable domain for inhibitor targeting. 
The molecules investigated on parasite HSP90 are mainly developed from known 
inhibitors of the human counterpart, and they have strong limitations due to 
selectivity issues, accounting for the high conservation of the ATP-binding site 
between the parasite and human proteins. The current review highlights the 
recent structural progress made to support the rational design of new molecules 
able to effectively block the chaperone activity of parasite HSP90.
