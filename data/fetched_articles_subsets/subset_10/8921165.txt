A microplate chloride ion channel assay, using N-(6-methoxyquinolyl) acetoethyl 
ester (MQAE) fluorescence changes has been developed. Forskolin stimulation of 
T84 cells caused cAMP-dependent, increased Cl- loss. Forskolin responses after 6 
min gave an EC50 of 0.27 +/- 0.05 microM, illustrating the reproducibility of 
the assay. Forskolin exposure of CFPAC-1 cells, containing delta F508 CFTR, and 
CFPAC-1 PLJ4.7 cells, transfected with WT-CFTR stimulated Cl- secretion only 
from the latter, showing that the assay can be used to measure CFTR function. 
Stimulation of CFPAC-1 cells with ionomycin increased Cl- efflux, demonstrating 
functional Ca(2+)-mediated Cl- secretion in these cells. Ionomycin also induced 
a dose-responsive Cl- efflux from T84 cells that, unlike the forskolin response, 
was Ca2+ dependent. Removal of Na+ ions severely inhibited basal and stimulated 
Cl- efflux from T84 cells. However, furosemide did not affect 
forskolin-stimulated JCl, although the magnitude of the Cl- loss was reduced. 
The Stern-Volmer constant for MQAE fluorescence in T84 cells was calculated as 
28.3 +/- 0.9 M-1 and the [Cl-]i in untreated T84 cells was determined as 52.4 
+/- 0.6 mM. Stimulation of T84 cells with ionomycin and forskolin before 
inducing Cl- efflux allowed calculation of initial efflux rates without 
interference by second messenger generation and ion channel activation kinetics.
