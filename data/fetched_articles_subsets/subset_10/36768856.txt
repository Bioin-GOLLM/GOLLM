Ion channels provide the basis for the nervous system's intrinsic electrical 
activity. Neuronal excitability is a characteristic property of neurons and is 
critical for all functions of the nervous system. Glia cells fulfill essential 
supportive roles, but unlike neurons, they also retain the ability to divide. 
This can lead to uncontrolled growth and the formation of gliomas. Ion channels 
are involved in the unique biology of gliomas pertaining to peritumoral 
pathology and seizures, diffuse invasion, and treatment resistance. The emerging 
picture shows ion channels in the brain at the crossroads of neurophysiology and 
fundamental pathophysiological processes of specific cancer behaviors as 
reflected by uncontrolled proliferation, infiltration, resistance to apoptosis, 
metabolism, and angiogenesis. Ion channels are highly druggable, making them an 
enticing therapeutic target. Targeting ion channels in difficult-to-treat brain 
tumors such as gliomas requires an understanding of their extremely heterogenous 
tumor microenvironment and highly diverse molecular profiles, both representing 
major causes of recurrence and treatment resistance. In this review, we survey 
the current knowledge on ion channels with oncogenic behavior within the 
heterogeneous group of gliomas, review ion channel gene expression as genomic 
biomarkers for glioma prognosis and provide an update on therapeutic 
perspectives for repurposed and novel ion channel inhibitors and electrotherapy.
