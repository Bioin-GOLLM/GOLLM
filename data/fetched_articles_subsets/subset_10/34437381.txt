Two high-mass polar compounds were observed in aqueous side-fractions from the 
purification of okadaic acid (1) and dinophysistoxin-2 (2) from Dinophysis 
blooms in Spain and Norway. These were isolated and shown to be 
24-O-β-d-glucosides of 1 and 2 (4 and 5, respectively) by nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and enzymatic hydrolysis. 
These, together with standards of 1, 2, dinophysistoxin-1 (3), and a synthetic 
specimen of 7-deoxy-1 (7), combined with an understanding of their mass 
spectrometric fragmentation patterns, were then used to identify 1-5, the 
24-O-β-d-glucoside of dinophysistoxin-1 (6), 7, 7-deoxy-2 (8), and 7-deoxy-3 (9) 
in a range of extracts from Dinophysis blooms, Dinophysis cultures, and 
contaminated shellfish from Spain, Norway, Ireland, Canada, and New Zealand. A 
range of Prorocentrum&nbsp;lima cultures was also examined by liquid 
chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) and was 
found to contain 1, 3, 7, and 9. However, although 4-6 were not detected in 
these cultures, low levels of putative glycosides with the same exact masses as 
4 and 6 were present. The potential implications of these findings for the 
toxicology, metabolism, and biosynthesis of the okadaic acid group of marine 
biotoxins are briefly discussed.
