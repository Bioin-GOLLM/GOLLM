We describe substantial variant diversity among 23 detected SARS-CoV-2 Omicron 
lineage viruses cocirculating among healthcare workers and inpatients (272 
sequenced samples) from Porto Alegre, Brazil, during November 2022-January 2023. 
BQ.1 and related lineages (61.4%) were most common, followed by BE.9 (19.1%), 
first described in November 2022 in the Amazon region.
