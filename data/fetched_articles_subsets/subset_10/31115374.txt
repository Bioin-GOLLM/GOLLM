BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: : Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is one of the most common 
chronic pain conditions of unknown aetiology. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been 
reported in FMS with some studies reporting the presence of mitochondrial 
mutation namely A3243G, which also causes mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, 
lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. This pilot study was conducted to 
assess this mutation and also detect large deletions in mitochondrial DNA 
(mtDNA) in patients with FMS.
METHODS: : Thirty female patients with FMS participated and 30 matched controls 
were included. Genomic DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
amplification using specific primers followed by restriction digestion with Apa 
I enzyme to detect the specific A3243G mtDNA mutation. Long-range PCR was done 
in two sets to detect the large deletions in the mtDNA. Biochemical parameters 
including thyroid-stimulating hormone and vitamin D levels were also looked at.
RESULTS: : None of the patients were found to carry the common mutation or large 
deletions. Low vitamin D level was a common finding. Hypothyroidism was found in 
a few patients.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: : Although the common mutation or large mtDNA 
deletions were not detected in blood mtDNA in the FMS patients, mutations in the 
muscle and sequence variation in mtDNA remained a possibility. Future studies in 
both blood and muscle tissue including mtDNA sequencing are warranted in such 
patients to determine if a subset of FMS patients have mitochondrial myopathy.
