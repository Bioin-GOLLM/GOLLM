In recent decades, genetic research has nominated promising pathways and 
biological insights contributing to the etiological landscape of 
parkinsonism-related dystonias and atypical parkinsonism-related syndromes. 
Several disease-causing mutations and genetic risk factors have been unraveled, 
providing a deeper molecular understanding of the complex genetic architecture 
underlying these conditions. These disorders are difficult to accurately 
diagnose and categorize, thus making genetics research challenging. On one hand, 
dystonia is an umbrella term linked to clinically heterogeneous forms of disease 
including dopa-responsive dystonia, myoclonus-dystonia, rapid-onset 
dystonia-parkinsonism and dystonia-parkinsonism, often viewed as a precursor to 
Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, atypical parkinsonism disorders, such as 
progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy and corticobasal 
degeneration, are rare in nature and represent a wide range of diverse and 
overlapping phenotypic variabilities, with genetic research limited by sample 
size availability. The current review summarizes the plethora of available 
genetic information for these diseases, outlining limits and future directions.
