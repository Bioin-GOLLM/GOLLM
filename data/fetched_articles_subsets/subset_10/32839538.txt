Candida auris is among the most important emerging fungal pathogens, yet 
mechanistic insights into its immune recognition and control are lacking. Here, 
we integrate transcriptional and functional immune-cell profiling to uncover 
innate defence mechanisms against C. auris. C. auris induces a specific 
transcriptome in human mononuclear cells, a stronger cytokine response compared 
with Candida albicans, but a lower macrophage lysis capacity. C. auris-induced 
innate immune activation is mediated through the recognition of C-type lectin 
receptors, mainly elicited by structurally unique C. auris mannoproteins. In in 
vivo experimental models of disseminated candidiasis, C. auris was less virulent 
than C. albicans. Collectively, these results demonstrate that C. auris is a 
strong inducer of innate host defence, and identify possible targets for 
adjuvant immunotherapy.
