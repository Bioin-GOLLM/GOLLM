Agonist activation of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR35 involves 
transmembrane domain III and is transduced via Gα₁₃ and β-arrestin-2.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: GPR35 is a poorly characterized G protein-coupled 
receptor at which kynurenic acid has been suggested to be the endogenous ligand. 
We wished to test this and develop assays appropriate for the study of this 
receptor.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Human and rat orthologues of GPR35 were engineered and 
expressed and assays developed to assess interaction with β-arrestin-2, 
activation of Gα₁₃ and agonist-induced internalization.
KEY RESULTS: GPR35-β-arrestin-2 interaction assays confirmed that both the 
endogenous tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid and the synthetic ligand 
zaprinast had agonist action at each orthologue. Zaprinast was substantially 
more potent than kynurenic acid at each and both agonists displayed 
substantially greater potency at rat GPR35. Two novel thiazolidinediones also 
displayed agonism and displayed similar potency at each GPR35 orthologue. The 
three ligand classes acted orthosterically with respect to each other, 
suggesting overlapping binding sites and, consistent with this, mutation to 
alanine of the conserved arginine at position 3.36 or tyrosine 3.32 in 
transmembrane domain III abolished β-arrestin-2 recruitment in response to each 
ligand at each orthologue.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These studies indicate that β-arrestin-2 
interaction assays are highly appropriate to explore the pharmacology of GPR35 
and that Gα₁₃ activation is an alternative avenue of signal generation from 
GPR35. Arginine and tyrosine residues in transmembrane domain III are integral 
to agonist recognition and function of this receptor. The potency of kynurenic 
acid at human GPR35 is sufficiently low, however, to question whether it is 
likely to be the true endogenous ligand for this receptor.
