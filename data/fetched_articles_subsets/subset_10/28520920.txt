Many cellular proteins are methylated on lysine residues and this has been most 
intensively studied for histone proteins. Lysine methylations on non-histone 
proteins are also frequent, but in most cases the functional significance of the 
methylation event, as well as the identity of the responsible lysine (K) 
specific methyltransferase (KMT), remain unknown. Several recently discovered 
KMTs belong to the so-called seven-β-strand (7BS) class of MTases and we have 
here investigated an uncharacterized human 7BS MTase currently annotated as part 
of the endothelin converting enzyme 2, but which should be considered a separate 
enzyme. Combining in vitro enzymology and analyzes of knockout cells, we 
demonstrate that this MTase efficiently methylates K36 in eukaryotic translation 
elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that this 
novel KMT is named eEF1A-KMT4 (gene name EEF1AKMT4), in agreement with the 
recently established nomenclature. Furthermore, by ribosome profiling we show 
that the absence of K36 methylation affects translation dynamics and changes 
translation speed of distinct codons. Finally, we show that eEF1A-KMT4 is part 
of a novel family of human KMTs, defined by a shared sequence motif in the 
active site and we demonstrate the importance of this motif for catalytic 
activity.
