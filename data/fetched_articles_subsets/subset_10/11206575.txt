In our previous report, one 34-bp sequence from a long terminal repeat (LTR) of 
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) clone, loxLTR-1, was proposed as a 
target site for site-specific excision by modified Cre recombinase. To support 
this suggestion, an engineered lox sequence, designated loxIL1, was made. This 
variant lox has the corresponding sequence of loxLTR-1 at the spacer region and 
the last two bases of inverted repeat sequence. Through in vitro recombination 
assay, loxIL1 also allowed the wild-type Cre to specifically recombine the 
sequence. An in vitro DNA binding experiment with mutants CreK244R and CreK244L 
revealed that lysine 244 of Cre plays an important role in interaction with the 
engineered lox. This result suggests that loxLTR-1 would be a candidate for 
antiviral strategy using site-specific recombinase.
