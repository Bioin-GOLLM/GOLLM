PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of 
rAAV8-hGRK1-Tlcd3b in a Tlcd3b-/- mouse model of retinal generation and validate 
TLCD3B's role as a ceramide synthase in vivo.
METHODS: Using Tlcd3b-/- mice as an inherited retinal disease animal model, we 
performed subretinal injection of rAAV8-hGRK1-Tlcd3b and evaluated the efficacy 
of gene replacement therapy. Tlcd3b-/- mice were treated at two time points: 
postnatal day 21 (P21) and postnatal day 120 (P120) with various dosages.
RESULTS: Tlcd3b overexpression rescued retinal degeneration in the mutant mice, 
as indicated by significantly improved photoreceptor function and preservation 
of photoreceptor cells over the course of 1 year. Although Tlcd3b is expressed 
in all cell types in the retina, photoreceptor cell-specific expression of 
Tlcd3b is sufficient to rescue the phenotype, indicating the primary function of 
TLCD3B is in photoreceptors. Consistent with the idea that TLCD3B is a ceramide 
synthase, mass spectrometry analyses of the mutant retina indicate the reduction 
of C16-, C18-, and C20-ceramides in the retina, which are restored with Tlcd3b 
overexpression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of gene therapy 
in treating Tlcd3b mutant retina, laying the foundation for developing future 
therapy for TLCD3B retinopathy.
