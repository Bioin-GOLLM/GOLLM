A diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) has been associated with 
increased risk of hepatobiliary cancers, colorectal cancer and all-cause 
mortality in several studies, while associations with cardiovascular disease 
have been inconsistent. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
published cohort studies on the topic to summarize these associations. PubMed 
and Embase databases were searched up to January 13th, 2020. Cohort studies on 
PSC and risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or mortality were included. 
Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were 
estimated using random effects models. The summary RR (95% CI) comparing persons 
with PSC to persons without PSC was 584.37 (269.42-1267.51, I2 = 89%, n = 4) for 
cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), 155.54 (125.34-193.02, I2 = 0%, n = 3) for 
hepatobiliary cancer, 30.22 (11.99-76.17, I2 = 0%, n = 2) for liver cancer, 
16.92 (8.73-32.78, I2 = 88%, n = 4) for gastrointestinal cancer, 7.56 
(2.42-23.62, I2 = 0%, n = 3) for pancreatic cancer, 6.10 (4.19-8.87, I2 = 14%, 
n = 7) for colorectal cancer (CRC), 4.13 (2.99-5.71, I2 = 80%, n = 5) for total 
cancer, 3.55 (2.94-4.28, I2 = 46%, n = 5) for all-cause mortality, and 1.57 
(0.25-9.69, I2 = 79%, n = 2) for cardiovascular disease. Strong positive 
associations were observed between PSC and risk of CCA, hepatobiliary cancer, 
liver cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, CRC, total cancer, and 
all-cause mortality, but not for cardiovascular disease.
