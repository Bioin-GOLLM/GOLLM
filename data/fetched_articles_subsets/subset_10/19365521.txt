BACKGROUND: Molecular genetic methods were implemented in the detection of 
thrombophilic disorders in the 1990's with the discovery of coagulation 
inhibitors antithrombin III (AT III), protein C (PC) and S (PS). The discovery 
of the molecular cause of activated protein C (APC) resistance by Bertina in 
1994 greatly expanded their utilization.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Currently, a broad group of molecular genetic markers with 
a clearly demonstrated risk of thrombophilia are used--mutation of FV Leiden 
506R/Q, mutation of prothrombin (F II) 20210G/A, mutation of 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C/T in homozygous form, mutation 
of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) 4G/5G, mutations of single 
coagulation inhibitors as well as a number of polymorphisms with controversial 
thrombophilic risk such as F XIII Val34Leu, platelet glycoproteins, endothelial 
protein C receptor and thrombomodulin. Another area utilizing molecular genetic 
methods is research of the pathophysiology of individual coagulation processes. 
To date, the greatest advances in regard to APC resistance have been achieved 
here. Although the molecular cause of APC resistance was clearly demonstrated in 
the 1990's, its clinical variability has not yet been fully explained. The same 
is true for the second most widespread mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, 
where only the latest research has hinted at a possible mechanism of expression 
of the genetic changes in the actual coagulation process.
CONCLUSIONS: The future of molecular genetic methods is in achieving a complex 
understanding of the pathophysiology of thrombophilia and not only in its 
utilization as a method for detecting many polymorphisms with a very low risk of 
thrombosis.
