High-content imaging using automated microscopy and computer vision allows 
multivariate profiling of single-cell phenotypes. Here, we present methods for 
the application of the CISPR-Cas9 system in large-scale, image-based, gene 
perturbation experiments. We show that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene perturbation 
can be achieved in human tissue culture cells in a timeframe that is compatible 
with image-based phenotyping. We developed a pipeline to construct a large-scale 
arrayed library of 2,281 sequence-verified CRISPR-Cas9 targeting plasmids and 
profiled this library for genes affecting cellular morphology and the 
subcellular localization of components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We 
conceived a machine-learning method that harnesses genetic heterogeneity to 
score gene perturbations and identify phenotypically perturbed cells for 
in-depth characterization of gene perturbation effects. This approach enables 
genome-scale image-based multivariate gene perturbation profiling using 
CRISPR-Cas9.
