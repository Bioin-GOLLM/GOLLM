Previously, we identified an altered structural form of thymidylate synthase 
(TS) in a human colonic tumor cell line. This form, which is encoded by a 
variant structural gene, renders cells relatively resistant to 
5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine as a result of the reduced affinity of the enzyme for 
the active metabolite 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylic acid. We have isolated a cDNA 
clone specific to the altered TS and have determined its sequence. Two point 
mutations distinguish the normal from the altered TS mRNAs. One, a (A----G) 
change, is located within the 3'-untranslated region; the other, a T----C change 
within the amino acid-coding region, predicts replacement of tyrosine by 
histidine at residue 33 of the polypeptide. This sequence change was confirmed 
by direct analysis of cDNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and was 
further verified using allele-specific oligonucleotides as probes in Northern 
blots. These results, along with studies by other laboratories showing Tyr33 to 
be evolutionarily conserved, suggest that this residue plays an important role 
in TS function.
