In this study, we examined and characterized disease-specific TCR signatures in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical 
spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). TCR β libraries using unique molecular 
identifier-based methodologies were sequenced in paired peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CSF cells from HAM/TSP patients and normal healthy 
donors (NDs). The sequence analysis demonstrated that TCR β repertoires in CSF 
of HAM/TSP patients were highly expanded and contained both TCR clonotypes 
shared with PBMCs and uniquely enriched within the CSF. In addition, we analyzed 
TCR β repertoires of highly expanded and potentially immunopathologic HTLV-1 
Tax11-19-specific CD8+ T cells from PBMCs of HLA-A*0201+ HAM/TSP and identified 
a conserved motif (PGLAG) in the CDR3 region. Importantly, TCR β clonotypes of 
expanded clones in HTLV-1 Tax11-19-specific CD8+ T cells were also expanded and 
enriched in the CSF of the same patient. These results suggest that exploring 
TCR repertoires of CSF and antigen-specific T cells may provide a TCR repertoire 
signature in virus-associated neurologic disorders.
