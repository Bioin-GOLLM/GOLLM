OBJECTIVE: To report disease-causing mutations in the cyclic nucleotide-gated 
channel Î± 3 gene (CNGA3) identified by exome sequencing and bioinformatics 
filtering in a single patient.
METHODS: The entire protein-coding sequence of a patient with a retinal disease 
was enriched by in-solution targeted capture and massively parallel sequenced at 
50-fold coverage. The assembled sequence was compared with databases of normal 
genomic sequences to identify nonsynonymous variants, which were further 
filtered (1) with a prioritization of genes associated with retinal diseases, 
(2) according to the likelihood of variant damage to protein function, (3) 
following the predictions of a recessive model, and (4) against common 
polymorphisms observed in normal genomes. Clinical evaluation and segregation 
analysis of the mutant alleles in the patient's family were performed; mutations 
were excluded in healthy controls.
RESULTS: Analysis yielded a molecular diagnosis of achromatopsia. Two compound 
heterozygous mutations were identified in CNGA3 of this patient, c.829C>T 
p.R277C and c.1580T>G p.L527R; they were not observed in the normal population 
and cosegregated with the phenotype of achromatopsia in the patient's family.
CONCLUSION: These mutations are the cause of achromatopsia in this family.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The key advantages of massively parallel sequencing over 
linkage mapping and cloning are highlighted by (1) the small sample size 
required for successful analysis and (2) the rapid and high-throughput manner in 
which the mutations are identified. This new tool will likely have major effects 
on the management and research of rare genetic eye diseases in the new era of 
personalized genomic medicine.
