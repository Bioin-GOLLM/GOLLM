1,3-Bis(phenyl-sufanylmeth-yl)benzene.

Stewart CA, Dickie DA, Kemp RA.

The complete mol-ecule of the title compound, C(20)H(18)S(2), is generated by 
crystallographic mirror symmetry, with two C atoms lying on the mirror plane. 
All of the independent atoms are contained within two planes defined by the 
thio-phenyl rings (C(6)S) and the central phenyl ring with the methyl-ene 
bridge; the r.m.s deviations of these planes are 0.012 and 0.025 Å, 
respectively. The two planes are almost perpendicular to one another at a 
dihedral angle of 80.24 (10)°. Inter-molecular C-H-π inter-actions are present 
in the crystal structure.
