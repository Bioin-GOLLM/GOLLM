The spontaneous incidence of chloramphenicol (Cam) resistant mutant bacteria is 
at least ten-fold higher in cultures of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 
O157:H7 strain EDL933 than in E. coli K-12. It is at least 100-fold higher in 
the dam (DNA adenine methyltransferase) derivative of EDL933, compared to the 
dam strain of E. coli K-12, thereby preventing the use of Cam resistance as a 
marker in gene replacement technology. Genome sequencing of Cam-resistant 
isolates of EDL933 and its dam derivatives showed that the marR (multiple 
antibiotic resistance) gene was mutated in every case but not in the 
Cam-sensitive parental strains. As expected from mutation in the marR gene, the 
Cam-resistant bacteria were also found to be resistant to tetracycline and 
nalidixic acid. The marR gene in strain EDL933 is annotated as a shorter open 
reading frame than that in E. coli K-12 but the longer marR(+) open reading 
frame was more efficient at complementing the marR antibiotic-resistance 
phenotype of strain EDL933. Beta-lactamase-tolerant derivatives were present at 
frequencies 10-100 times greater in cultures of marR derivatives of strain 
EDL933 than the parent strain. Spontaneous mutation frequency to rifampicin, 
spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance was the same in E. coli O157:H7 and E. 
coli K-12 strains.
