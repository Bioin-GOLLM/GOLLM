The expression of A-type lamin is downregulated in several cancers, and lamin 
defects are the cause of several diseases including a form of accelerated aging. 
We report that depletion of lamin A/C expression in normal human cells leads to 
a dramatic downregulation of the Rb family of tumor suppressors and a defect in 
cell proliferation. Lamin A/C-depleted cells exhibited a flat morphology and 
accumulated markers of cellular senescence. This senescent phenotype was 
accompanied by engagement of the p53 tumor suppressor and induction of the p53 
target gene p21 and was prevented by small hairpin RNAs against p53, p21, or by 
the oncoprotein Mdm2. The expression of E2F target genes, normally required for 
cell cycle progression, was downregulated after lamin A/C depletion but restored 
after the inactivation of p53. A similar senescence response was observed in 
myoblasts from a patient with a lamin A mutation causing muscular dystrophy. We 
thus reveal a previously unnoticed mechanism of controlling cell cycle genes 
expression, which depends on p53 but does not require the retinoblastoma family 
of tumor suppressors and that can be relevant to understand the pathogenesis of 
laminopathies and perhaps aging.
