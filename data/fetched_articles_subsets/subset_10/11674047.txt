The synthesis of the C(26)-C(32) oxazole fragment 4 and its C(32) epimer 20 of 
serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP1 and PP2A inhibitor calyculin C is 
presented. The syn methyl arrangement in 4 was established through cyclic 
stereocontrol. Several methods for oxidizing the intermediate oxazolines 18 and 
19 to the finished oxazole fragments were explored. The best results were 
obtained with oxidations proceeding through the corresponding ester enolate when 
the carbamate NH side chain was temporarily protected with a TMS group, or with 
CuBr(2)/DBU/HMTA-based oxidations. The finished oxazole fragment 4 was obtained 
in 21% overall yield, starting from Boc-D-alaninal.
