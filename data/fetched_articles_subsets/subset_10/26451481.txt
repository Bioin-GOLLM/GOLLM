Among the three phases of mRNA translation-initiation, elongation, and 
termination-initiation has traditionally been considered to be rate limiting and 
thus the focus of regulation. Emerging evidence, however, demonstrates that 
control of ribosome translocation (polypeptide elongation) can also be 
regulatory and indeed exerts a profound influence on development, neurologic 
disease, and cell stress. The correspondence of mRNA codon usage and the 
relative abundance of their cognate tRNAs is equally important for mediating the 
rate of polypeptide elongation. Here, we discuss recent results showing that 
ribosome pausing is a widely used mechanism for controlling translation and, as 
a result, biological transitions in health and disease.
