Sialyltransferases are key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of biologically 
and pathologically important sialic acid-containing molecules in nature. In this 
study, the activity of a putative sialyltransferase (Pm0160) harboring an 
inherent mutation D141Y in the conserved DDG motif, which has been identified in 
GT52 and GT80 families, was restored by reverse mutation. More interestingly, a 
hydrogen-bond chain was found to form between three conserved residues (Asp141, 
Asn109, and Asp33) of GT80 sialyltransferases based on recently determined 
crystal structures. Our mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the 
hydrogen-bond chain connecting the general base Asp141 with Nβ4, Nβ1, and Nα1 
plays an essential role in maintaining protein structural stability other than 
keeping the general base Asp141 in a productive orientation for sialic acid 
transfer.
