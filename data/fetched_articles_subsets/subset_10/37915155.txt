BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is driven by traditional risk factors, sex, 
and genetic differences. The Asian population, specifically Indonesians, has 
been known at high risk of insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. A 
possible genetic risk factor related to cardiovascular diseases is Gly972Arg 
polymorphism of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) gene, as this impairs 
endothelial function. To date, whether there is a gender difference in Gly972Arg 
polymorphism of the IRS-1 gene in Indonesians is unknown. This study aimed to to 
define whether there is a gender difference in Gly972Arg polymorphism of the 
IRS-1 gene in Indonesians.
METHODS: We studied adults living in two areas (rural and urban) in Indonesia. 
We collected demographic and clinical data from the study subjects. Gly972Arg 
polymorphism of the IRS-1 gene (rs1801278) was detected using TaqMan real-time 
polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: A total of 378 subjects were recruited. The wild-type allele (CC) was 
found in 86 (22.8%) subjects, heterozygous mutant allele (CT) in 245 (64.8%), 
and homozygous mutant allele in 47 (12.4%). The proportion of subjects with T 
alleles was significantly higher among women than men (54.6% vs. 45.4%, odds 
ratio: 1.89; p = 0.01). Subjects with T allele more often have hypertension 
(odds ratio: 1.69, p = 0.058).
CONCLUSION: There were a higher proportion of women than men carrying the T 
allele of Gly972Arg polymorphism among Indonesians. Individuals with the T 
allele appeared to show a greater prevalence of hypertension. These results may 
explain a possible mechanism of the high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in 
Indonesia, especially in women.
