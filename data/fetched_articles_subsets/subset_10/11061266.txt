A 22-year-old man presented with recurrent ulnar mononeuropathies and diffusely 
slow nerve conduction velocities. Arylsulfatase A (ASA) activity from leukocytes 
and fibroblasts was reduced, and urinary sulfatides were increased. Sural nerve 
biopsy revealed a reduction in myelinated fibers and Schwann cell inclusions. 
Results of studies of CNS integrity, including cranial MRI, evoked potentials, 
and neuropsychologic tests, were normal. Molecular genetic analyses revealed a 
novel homozygous missense mutation (Thr286Pro) in the ASA gene.
