The P2Y12 receptor is a key player in platelet activation and a major target for 
antithrombotic drugs. The beneficial effects of P2Y12 receptor antagonists 
might, however, not be restricted to the primary and secondary prevention of 
arterial thrombosis. Indeed, it has been established that platelet activation 
also has an essential role in inflammation. Additionally, nonplatelet P2Y12 
receptors present in immune cells and vascular smooth muscle cells might be 
effective players in the inflammatory response. This review will investigate the 
biological and clinical impact of P2Y12 receptor inhibition beyond its 
platelet-driven antithrombotic effects, focusing on its anti-inflammatory role. 
We will discuss the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms of 
P2Y12-mediated inflammation, including cytokine release, platelet-leukocyte 
interactions and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Then we will summarize 
the current evidence on the beneficial effects of P2Y12 antagonists during 
various clinical inflammatory diseases, especially during sepsis, acute lung 
injury, asthma, atherosclerosis, and cancer.
