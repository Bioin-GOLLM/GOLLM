Asians as well as Europeans have light skin, for which no genes to date are 
known to be responsible. A mutation, Ala481Thr (c.G1559A), in the oculocutaneous 
albinism type II (OCA2) gene has approximately 70% function of the wild type 
allele in melanogenesis. In this study, the distribution of the mutation was 
investigated in a total of 2,615 individuals in 20 populations from various 
areas. OCA2 481Thr prevailed almost exclusively in a northeastern part of Asia. 
The allele frequency was highest in Buryat (0.24) in Mongolia and showed a 
north-south downward geographical gradient. These findings suggest that OCA2 
481Thr arose in a region of low ultraviolet radiation and thereafter spread to 
neighboring populations.
