A candidate gene study of capecitabine-related toxicity in colorectal cancer 
identifies new toxicity variants at DPYD and a putative role for ENOSF1 rather 
than TYMS.

OBJECTIVE: Capecitabine is an oral 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) pro-drug commonly used 
to treat colorectal carcinoma and other tumours. About 35% of patients 
experience dose-limiting toxicity. The few proven genetic biomarkers of 5-FU 
toxicity are rare variants and polymorphisms, respectively, at candidate loci 
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS).
DESIGN: We investigated 1456 polymorphisms and rare coding variants near 25 
candidate 5-FU pathway genes in 968 UK patients from the QUASAR2 clinical trial.
RESULTS: We identified the first common DPYD polymorphisms to be consistently 
associated with capecitabine toxicity, rs12132152 (toxicity allele frequency 
(TAF)=0.031, OR=3.83, p=4.31×10(-6)) and rs12022243 (TAF=0.196, OR=1.69, 
p=2.55×10(-5)). rs12132152 was particularly strongly associated with hand-foot 
syndrome (OR=6.1, p=3.6×10(-8)). The rs12132152 and rs12022243 associations were 
independent of each other and of previously reported DPYD toxicity variants. 
Next-generation sequencing additionally identified rare DPYD variant p.Ala551Thr 
in one patient with severe toxicity. Using functional predictions and published 
data, we assigned p.Ala551Thr as causal for toxicity. We found that polymorphism 
rs2612091, which lies within an intron of ENOSF1, was also associated with 
capecitabine toxicity (TAF=0.532, OR=1.59, p=5.28×10(-6)). ENSOF1 is adjacent to 
TYMS and there is a poorly characterised regulatory interaction between the two 
genes/proteins. Unexpectedly, rs2612091 fully explained the previously reported 
associations between capecitabine toxicity and the supposedly functional TYMS 
variants, 5'VNTR 2R/3R and 3'UTR 6 bp ins-del. rs2612091 genotypes were, 
moreover, consistently associated with ENOSF1 mRNA levels, but not with TYMS 
expression.
CONCLUSIONS: DPYD harbours rare and common capecitabine toxicity variants. The 
toxicity polymorphism in the TYMS region may actually act through ENOSF1.
