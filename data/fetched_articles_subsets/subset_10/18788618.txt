OBJECTIVE: To explore factor IX gene mutations and molecular mechanism of 
haemophilia B in 3 unrelated families.
METHODS: The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and FIX activity (FIX: 
C) assay were used for phenotypic diagnosis. The STR loci gene polymorphisms for 
genetic linkage analysis in the patients and their family members were assayed. 
All of the 8 exons and the exon-intron boundaries of FIX gene were amplified by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Mutations were found in the FIX gene of the propositi. 
Proband 1 had a G22119A mutation in exon 6, proband 2 a G7392C mutation in exon 
2 and proband 3 a T32685C mutation in exon 8.
