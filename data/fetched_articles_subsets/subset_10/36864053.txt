Drought drastically restricts wheat production, so to dissect allelic variations 
of drought tolerant genes without imposing trade-offs between tolerance and 
yield is essential to cope with the circumstance. Here, we identify a drought 
tolerant WD40 protein encoding gene TaWD40-4B.1 of wheat via the genome-wide 
association study. The full-length allele TaWD40-4B.1C but not the truncated 
allele TaWD40-4B.1T possessing a nonsense nucleotide variation enhances drought 
tolerance and grain yield of wheat under drought. TaWD40-4B.1C interacts with 
canonical catalases, promotes their oligomerization and activities, and reduces 
H2O2 levels under drought. The knock-down of catalase genes erases the role of 
TaWD40-4B.1C in drought tolerance. TaWD40-4B.1C proportion in wheat accessions 
is negatively correlative with the annual rainfall, suggesting this allele may 
be selected during wheat breeding. The introgression of TaWD40-4B.1C enhances 
drought tolerance of the cultivar harboring TaWD40-4B.1T. Therefore, 
TaWD40-4B.1C could be useful for molecular breeding of drought tolerant wheat.
