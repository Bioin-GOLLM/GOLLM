Expression of the glutamine transporter SNAT3 increases in kidney during 
metabolic acidosis, suggesting a role during ammoniagenesis. Microarray analysis 
of Nrf2 knock-out (KO) mouse kidney identified Snat3 as the most significantly 
down-regulated transcript compared to wild-type (WT). We hypothesized that in 
the absence of NRF2 the kidney would be unable to induce SNAT3 under conditions 
of metabolic acidosis and therefore reduce the availability of glutamine for 
ammoniagenesis. Metabolic acidosis was induced for 7 days in WT and Nrf2 KO 
mice. Nrf2 KO mice failed to induce Snat3 mRNA and protein expression during 
metabolic acidosis. However, there were no differences in blood pH, bicarbonate, 
pCO2, chloride and calcium or urinary pH, ammonium and phosphate levels. Normal 
induction of ammoniagenic enzymes was observed whereas several amino acid 
transporters showed differential regulation. Moreover, Nrf2 KO mice during 
acidosis showed increased expression of renal markers of oxidative stress and 
injury and NRF2 activity was increased during metabolic acidosis in WT kidney. 
We conclude that NRF2 is required to adapt the levels of SNAT3 in response to 
metabolic acidosis. In the absence of NRF2 and SNAT3, the kidney does not have 
any major acid handling defect; however, increased oxidative stress and renal 
injury may occur.
