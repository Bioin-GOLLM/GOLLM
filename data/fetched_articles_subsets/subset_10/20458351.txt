OBJECTIVE: To compare the levels of plasma homocysteine (Hcy), vitamin B6 
(vit-B6), serum vitamin B12 (vit-B12), and folate in healthy individuals and in 
patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PXG), 
or primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Forty healthy subjects, 48 patients with NTG, 38 
patients with PXG, and 34 patients with POAG were included in the study. Those 
who used vitamin supplements or medications affecting Hcy and vitamin levels 
were excluded from the study. The levels of Hcy and vit-B6 were measured by High 
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The levels of serum vit-B12 and folic 
acid were measured by competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CEI). 
One-way analysis if variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and the 
Tukey honestly significant difference test were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The mean Hcy level of the PXG group was 15.46+/-9.27 micromol/L which 
was significantly higher (P=0.03) than that of the control group. There were no 
statistical differences in serum vit-B12 and folate levels among control 
subjects and NTG, PXG and POAG groups (P>0.05). It was found that the mean 
plasma vit-B6 level was significantly higher in subjects with NTG (P=0.03) and 
POAG (P=0.025) versus controls. Mean vit-B6 levels in NTG and POAG were 
30.50+/-11.29 microg/L and 30+/-12.15 microg/L, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The plasma level of Hcy was found to be increased only in PXG 
patients and the plasma levels of vit-B6 were found to increase in the NTG and 
POAG sample groups. Using homocysteine and vit-B6 levels as the determinants of 
hyperhomocysteinemia still needs further research.
