AIMS: Inflammation is an important driver of hypertension. Periodontitis is a 
chronic inflammatory disease, which could provide a mechanism for 
pro-hypertensive immune activation, but evidence of a causal relationship in 
humans is scarce. We aimed to investigate the nature of the association between 
periodontitis and hypertension.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis 
in the ∼750 000 UK-Biobank/International Consortium of Blood 
Pressure-Genome-Wide Association Studies participants using single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in SIGLEC5, DEFA1A3, MTND1P5, and LOC107984137 loci 
GWAS-linked to periodontitis, to ascertain their effect on blood pressure (BP) 
estimates. This demonstrated a significant relationship between 
periodontitis-linked SNPs and BP phenotypes. We then performed a randomized 
intervention trial on the effects of treatment of periodontitis on BP. One 
hundred and one hypertensive patients with moderate/severe periodontitis were 
randomized to intensive periodontal treatment (IPT; sub- and supragingival 
scaling/chlorhexidine; n = 50) or control periodontal treatment (CPT; 
supragingival scaling; n = 51) with mean ambulatory 24-h (ABPM) systolic BP 
(SBP) as primary outcome. Intensive periodontal treatment improved periodontal 
status at 2 months, compared to CPT. This was accompanied by a substantial 
reduction in mean SBP in IPT compared to the CPT (mean difference of -11.1 mmHg; 
95% CI 6.5-15.8; P < 0.001). Systolic BP reduction was correlated to periodontal 
status improvement. Diastolic BP and endothelial function (flow-mediated 
dilatation) were also improved by IPT. These cardiovascular changes were 
accompanied by reductions in circulating IFN-γ and IL-6 as well as activated 
(CD38+) and immunosenescent (CD57+CD28null) CD8+T cells, previously implicated 
in hypertension.
CONCLUSION: A causal relationship between periodontitis and BP was observed 
providing proof of concept for development of clinical trial in a large cohort 
of hypertensive patients. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02131922.
