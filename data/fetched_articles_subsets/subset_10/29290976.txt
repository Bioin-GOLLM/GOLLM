It has been shown that neurons alter the expression of astrocytic metabolic 
enzymes by secretion of until now unknown molecule(s) into extracellular fluid. 
Here, we present evidence that neuron-derived transthyretin (TTR) stimulates 
expression of glycolytic enzymes in astrocytes which is reflected by an 
increased synthesis of ATP. The action of TTR is restricted to regulatory 
enzymes of glycolysis: phosphofructokinase P (PFKP) and pyruvate kinase M1/M2 
isoforms (PKM1/2). The regulation of PFK and PKM expression by TTR is presumably 
specific for brain tissue and is independent of the role of TTR as a carrier 
protein for thyroxine and retinol. TTR induced expression of PKM and PFK is 
mediated by the cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway and is antagonized by the PI3K/Akt 
pathway. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for action of TTR 
as a neuron-derived energy metabolism activator in astrocytes and describe the 
mechanisms of its action. The data presented here suggest that TTR is involved 
in a mechanism in which neurons stimulate degradation of glycogen-derived 
glucosyl units without significant modulation of glucose uptake by glial cells.
