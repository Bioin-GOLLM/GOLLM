Cell-to-cell interactions via gap junctional communication and connexon 
hemichannels are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Gap junctions are 
highly specialized transmembrane structures that are formed by connexon 
hemichannels, which are further assembled from proteins called "connexins." In 
this paper, we discuss current knowledge about connexins in diabetes. We also 
discuss mechanisms of connexin influence and the role of individual connexins in 
various tissues and how these are affected in diabetes. Connexins may be a 
future target by both genetic and pharmacological approaches to develop 
treatments for the treatment of diabetes and its complications.
