Bis(di-2-pyridylmethane-diol-ÎºN,O,N')copper(II) dl-tartrate.

Zhao J, Li DS, Dong WW, Wang DJ, Guo L.

The reaction of di-2-pyridyl ketone with copper dichloride dihydrate and 
tartaric acid in water afforded the title compound, 
[Cu(C(11)H(10)N(2)O(2))(2)]C(4)H(4)O(6). The Cu(II) atom lies on an inversion 
center N,O,N'-chelated by two di-2-pyridylmethane-diol ligands in a tetragonally 
distorted octa-hedral geometry. The tartrate anion is also located on an 
inversion center and has disordered hydroxyl groups, each with an occupancy 
factor of 0.5. The hydroxyl groups of the complex cation are hydrogen bonded to 
the carboxyl-ate groups of the anion, thus connecting the two building units.
