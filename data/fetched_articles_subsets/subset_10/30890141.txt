BACKGROUND: Docetaxel is a widely used cytotoxic agent for treatments of various 
cancers. The ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter / multidrug resistance 
protein (MRP) ABCC10/MRP7, involved in transporting taxanes, has been associated 
with resistance to these agents. Since genetic variation in drug transporters 
may affect clinical outcomes, we examined whether polymorphism of ABCC10 could 
affect clinical responses to docetaxel.
METHODS: Using 18 NSCLC cell lines and CRISPR-based genome-edited HeLa cells, we 
analyzed whether genetic variants of ABCC10 (rs2125739, rs9349256) affected 
cytotoxicity to docetaxel. Subsequently, we analyzed genetic variants [ABCC10 
(rs2125739), ABCB1 (C1236T, C3435T, G2677 T/A), ABCC2 (rs12762549), and SLCO1B3 
(rs11045585)] in 69 blood samples of NSCLC patients treated with docetaxel 
monotherapy. Clinical outcomes were evaluated between genotype groups.
RESULTS: In the cell lines, only one genetic variant (rs2125739) was 
significantly associated with docetaxel cytotoxicity, and this was confirmed in 
the genome-edited cell line. In the 69 NSCLC patients, there were no significant 
differences related to rs2125739 genotype in terms of RR, PFS, or OS. However, 
this SNP was associated with grade 3/4 neutropenia (T/C group 60% vs. T/T group 
87%; P = 0.028). Furthermore, no patient with a T/C genotype experienced febrile 
neutropenia.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that genetic variation in the ABCC10 gene is 
associated with neutropenia for docetaxel treatment.
