BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) plays a critical 
role in the detoxification of the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde. This study 
was designed to examine the impact of global ALDH2 overexpression on 
alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis.
METHODS: Wild type Friend virus B (FVB) and ALDH2 transgenic mice were placed on 
a 4% alcohol or control diet for 12 weeks. Serum levels of aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin and 
cholesterol, hepatic triglyceride, steatosis, fat metabolism-related proteins, 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), 
autophagy and autophagy signalling were examined. The role of autophagy was 
evaluated in alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1)-transfected human hepatocellular 
liver carcinoma cells (VA-13) treated with or without the autophagy inducer 
rapamycin and lysosomal inhibitors.
RESULTS: Chronic alcohol intake led to elevated AST-, ALT-levels, bilirubin, 
AST/ALT ratio, cholesterol, hepatic triglycerides and hepatic fat deposition as 
evidenced by H&E and Oil Red O staining. Hepatic fat deposition was associated 
with disturbed levels of fat metabolism-related proteins (fatty acid synthase, 
SCD1), upregulated interleukin-6, TNF-α, cyclooxygenase, oxidative stress, and 
loss of autophagy, effects which were attenuated or ablated by the ALDH2 
transgene. Moreover, ethanol (100 mM) and acetaldehyde (100 and 500 μM) 
increased levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ, and suppressed autophagy in VA-13 cells, 
effects which were markedly alleviated by rapamycin. In addition, lysosomal 
inhibitors mimicked ethanol-induced p62 accumulation with little additive effect 
with ethanol. Ethanol significantly suppressed LC3 conversion in the presence of 
lysosomal inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results revealed that ALDH2 plays a beneficial role 
in ameliorating chronic alcohol intake-induced hepatic steatosis and 
inflammation through regulation of autophagy.
