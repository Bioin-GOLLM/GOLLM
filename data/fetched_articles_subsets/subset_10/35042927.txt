Knockdown of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) 
increased triglycerides (TG) in primary bovine hepatocytes, suggesting that 
PNPLA3 plays a causal role in hepatic TG clearing. In vivo, PNPLA3 abundance 
across the periparturient period is inversely related to hepatic TG accumulation 
and circulating fatty acid (FA) concentrations. The purpose of this research was 
to determine if PNPLA3, as well as other lipases, transcription factors, or 
FA-mediated genes, are regulated by FA mimicking liver lipid accumulation 
(ACCUM) and liver lipid clearing (RECOV) or singular FA physiologically found in 
dairy cows at 0.5 mM of circulating RECOV (iRECOV). Abundance of PNPLA3 tended 
to decrease with ACCUM and increased quadratically with RECOV (P ≤ 0.10), 
differing from PNPLA3 expression, but consistent with previous in vivo research. 
Adipose TG lipase abundance, but not other lipase abundances, was quadratically 
responsive to both ACCUM and RECOV (P ≤ 0.005). Abundance of PNPLA3 and SREBP1c 
and expression of LXRA responded similarly to iRECOV, with C18:0 tending to 
decrease abundance (P ≤ 0.07). Results indicate that bovine PNPLA3 is 
translationally regulated by FA and although a LXRA-SREBP1c pathway mediation is 
possible, the mechanism warrants further investigation.
