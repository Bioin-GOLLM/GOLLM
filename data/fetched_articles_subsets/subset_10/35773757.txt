OBJECTIVE: To explore clinical evaluation and genetic analysis of patients with 
idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH).
METHODS: The clinical data and phenotypes of 22 patients with IHH diagnosed and 
treated in our department were reviewed and analyzed. Whole-exome sequencing 
(WES) and Sanger method were used for variant analysis and verification.
RESULTS: Among the 22 cases of IHH probands, 12 cases of Kalman syndrome (KS) 
and 10 cases of IHH (nIHH) with normal sense of smell. On physical examination, 
males showed short penis, small testicles, small or inconspicuous laryngeal 
knots, and a sharp voice. Mammary gland development, mammary gland dysplasia, 
primary amenorrhea, etc. in women. Sex hormone examination: Follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), estradiol (E2) levels 
are reduced or at the lower limit of normal. There were nine missense variants 
of CHD7 gene in 8 patients. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics 
and Genomics guidelines, the c.307T>A(p.Ser103Thr), c.3143G>A(p.Gly1048Glu), 
c.6956G>T (p.Arg2319Leu) and c.3145A>T (p.Ser1049Cys) variants of CHD7 gene were 
predicted to be likely pathogenic (PS1+PP1+PM2, PM2+PM6+PP2+PP3, 
PM2+PM5+PM6+PP2+PP3 and PM2+PM6+PP2+PP3), the remaining 14 cases of IHH patients 
had negative genetic screening.
CONCLUSION: CHD7 gene variants may be related to IHH disease.
