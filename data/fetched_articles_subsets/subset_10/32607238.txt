BACKGROUND: The KRAS mutation is the second most common genetic variant in 
Chinese non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. At the 2019th World 
Conference of Lung Cancer, the KRAS G12C-specific inhibitor AMG510 showed 
promising results in the phase I clinical trial. However, the frequency, 
clinical characteristics, and prognostic significance of the KRAS G12C mutation 
in Chinese NSCLC patients are rarely reported.
METHODS: Next-generation sequencing was used to confirm the KRAS mutation status 
in 40,804 NSCLC patients from multiple centers (mCohort). Survival data were 
collected retrospectively from 1456 patients at one of the centers, the 
Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute (iCohort).
RESULTS: In the mCohort, 3998 patients (9.8%) were confirmed to harbor a KRAS 
mutation, of whom 1179 (29.5%) had the G12C subtype. In the iCohort, 130 NSCLC 
patients (8.9%) had a KRAS mutation and 42 (32.3%) had the G12C subtype. The 
G12C subgroup included more male patients (85.2% vs 67.4%, P < 0.0001) and more 
smokers (76.2% vs 53.4%, P = 0.02) than did the non-G12C subgroup. Both the KRAS 
mutation group and KRAS G12C mutation subgroup were associated with a shorter 
median overall survival (OS) than wildtype tumors (15.1 vs 26.7 months, hazard 
ratio [HR] KRAS  = 1.50, P = 0.002; 18.3 vs 26.7 months, HR G12C  = 1.66, 
P = 0.007). In Cox regression analysis, smoking (HR = 1.39, P = 0.05) and stage 
IV disease (HR = 2.72, P < 0.001) remained as independent predictors of shorter 
OS. Both the KRAS mutation (HR = 1.30, P = 0.07) and KRAS G12C mutation 
(HR = 1.47, P = 0.07) reached borderline significance.
CONCLUSIONS: In the largest sample used thus for, our study found that 
approximately 10% of Chinese NSCLC patients had KRAS mutations. Of these, nearly 
30% harbored the KRAS G12C mutation subtype, which was most common in male 
smokers. The KRAS G12C mutation is a biomarker of poor prognosis in Chinese 
NSCLC patients, which could potentially be improved by G12C-specific inhibitors 
in the future.(296 words).
