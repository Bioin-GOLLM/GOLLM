Sterilization of a material carries the risk of unwanted changes in physical and 
chemical structure. The choice of method is a challenge-the process must be 
efficient, without significantly changing the properties of the material. In the 
presented studies, we analyzed the effect of selected sterilization/disinfection 
techniques on the properties of nanofibrous polyurethane biomaterial. Both 
radiation techniques (UV, gamma, e-beam) and 20 minutes' contact with 70% EtOH 
were shown not to achieve 100% sterilization efficiency. The agar diffusion test 
showed higher sterilization efficiency when using an antimicrobial solution 
(AMS). At the same time, none of the analyzed techniques significantly altered 
the morphology and distribution of fiber diameters. EtOH and e-beam 
sterilization resulted in a significant reduction in material porosity together 
with an increase in the Young's modulus. Similarly, AMS sterilization increased 
the value of Young's modulus. In most cases, the viability of cells cultured in 
contact with the sterilized materials was not affected by the sterilization 
process. Only for UV sterilization, cell viability was significantly lower and 
reached about 70% of control after 72 h of culture.
