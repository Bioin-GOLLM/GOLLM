Molecular diagnostics has expanded to become the standard of care for a variety 
of solid tumor types. With limited diagnostic material, it is often desirable to 
use cytological preparations to provide rapid and accurate molecular results. 
This review covers important pre-analytic considerations and limitations, and a 
description of common techniques that the modern cytopathologist should 
understand when ordering and interpreting molecular tests in practice.
