Aim: Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are the cornerstone in treating drug-resistant 
tuberculosis (TB); the prevalence of TB among the population is diverse in 
different regions, understanding the relationship between resistance pattern and 
molecular characteristic of FQs in preextensive drug-resistant (pre-XDR) 
clinical isolates is limited in China. Methods: A total of 141 pre-XDR clinical 
isolates from different individuals stored at the National Clinical Centre were 
collected from the Beijing Chest Hospital, minimal inhibitory concentrations of 
levofloxacin (Lfx) and moxifloxacin (Mfx) as well as sequences of 
quinolone-resistant determining regions in gyrA and gyrB genes were examined. 
Results: One hundred twelve pre-XDR clinical isolates were resistant to both Lfx 
and Mfx, molecular analyses showed that 87.50%, 0.89%, and 6.25% of the pre-XDR 
clinical isolates harbored FQ resistance mutations in gyrA, gyrB, and in both. 
We found five amino acid mutation positions in gyrA and four in gyrB, The 
mutation position in gyrA included codons 94, 91, 90, 88, and 74, and in gyrB 
included codons 504, 500, 512, and 501. Codon 94 of gyrA was the most prevalent 
mutation (83.04%), containing the Asp amino acid substitution with Gly (50.89%), 
Asn (15.17%), Ala (8.93%), Tyr (6.25%), and His (1.79%). Conclusions: The 
mutations of gyrA were most common and the frequency of Asp94Gly was the highest 
in pre-XDR clinical isolates in Beijing, China. The mutations at codon 94 
significantly contributed to the resistance to both Lfx and Mfx in pre-XDR 
clinical isolates and may cause a high resistance level.
