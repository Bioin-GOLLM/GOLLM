Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease mediated by disturbed T cells and other 
immune cells, and is defined by deep-red, well-demarcated skin lesions. Due to 
its varied etiologies and indefinite standard pathogenesis, it is challenging to 
consider the right treatment exclusively for each psoriasis patient; thus, 
researchers yearn to seek even more precise treatments other than topical 
treatment and systemic therapy. Using biologics to target specific immune 
components, such as upregulated cytokines secreted by activated immune cells, is 
the most advanced therapy for psoriasis to date. By inhibiting the appropriate 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, cellular signaling can be altered and, thus, can 
inhibit further downstream inflammatory pathways. Herein, the roles of cytokines 
with their mechanisms of action in progressing psoriasis and how the usage of 
biologics alleviates cellular inflammation are discussed. In addition, other 
potential pro-inflammatory cytokines, with their mechanism of action, are 
presented herein. The authors hope that this gathered information may benefit 
future research in expanding the discovery of targeted psoriasis therapy.
