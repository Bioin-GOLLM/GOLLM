BACKGROUND: Growing evidence supports BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) 
playing a dual role in DNA damage response. However, the effects of Bid on 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation in response to 
etoposide-induced DNA damage have not been sufficiently investigated.
METHODS: Using a stable Bid-overexpression HCC cell line, Bid/PLC/PRF/5, 
overexpression of Bid promoted loss of viability in response to 
etoposide-induced DNA damage. MTT 
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]- and BrdU 
(5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine)-labeling assays revealed that etoposide-inhibited HCC 
cells grew in concentration-and time-dependent manners. The phosphorylations of 
Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in response to 
etoposide-induced DNA damage were analyzed by Western blotting.
RESULTS: The survival rates of 100 μM etoposide on the cells with control vector 
and Bid/PLC/PRF/5 at 48 hours amounted to 71% ± 0.75% and 59% ± 0.60% with MTT 
assay, and similar results of 85% ± 0.08% and 63% ± 0.14% with BrdU-labeling 
assay respectively. Moreover, overexpression of Bid sensitized the cells to 
apoptosis at a high dose of etoposide (causing irreparable damage). However, it 
had little effect on the proliferation at a low dose of etoposide (repairable 
damage). Furthermore, the phosphorylation status of Akt and MAPKs were 
investigated. Overexpression of Bid suppressed the activation of Akt with 
respect to etoposide-induced DNA damage. Similar to Akt, the levels of 
phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated c-Jun were attenuated by 
Bid-overexpression. On the contrary, the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was 
sustained at a high level, especially in Bid/PLC/PRF/5 cells.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that overexpression of Bid 
suppressed the activation of Akt, p38, and c-Jun, and promoted the activation of 
ERK1/2 induced by etoposide, suggesting that the promotion of ERK1/2 activation 
may have a negative effect on Bid-mediated HCC DNA damage induced by etoposide.
