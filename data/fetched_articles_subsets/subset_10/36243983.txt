The lysine-rich coiled-coil 1 (KRCC1) protein is overexpressed in multiple 
malignancies, including ovarian cancer, and overexpression correlates with poor 
overall survival. Despite a potential role in cancer progression, the biology of 
KRCC1 remains elusive. Here, we characterize the biology of KRCC1 and define its 
role in the DNA damage response and in cell cycle progression. We demonstrate 
that KRCC1 associates with the checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) upon DNA damage and 
regulates the CHK1-mediated checkpoint. KRCC1 facilitates RAD51 recombinase foci 
formation and augments homologous recombination repair. Furthermore, KRCC1 is 
required for proper S-phase progression and subsequent mitotic entry. Our 
findings uncover a novel component of the DNA damage response and a potential 
link between cell cycle, associated damage response and DNA repair.
