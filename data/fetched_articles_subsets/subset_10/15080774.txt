OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN: Ghrelin is a novel 28 amino acid peptide which is 
reported to have several endocrine and non-endocrine actions. It possesses 
strong growth hormone (GH)-releasing activity, which is mediated via the GH 
secretagogue receptor type 1a (GHS-R1a). We hypothesised that there might be 
functional sequential variations in the GHS-R1a gene affecting phenotypes linked 
to the GH/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-axis.
METHODS: To test our hypothesis we chose patients from our OPERA (Oulu Project 
Elucidating Risk of Atherosclerosis) study with low (n=96) and high (n=96) IGF-I 
levels, sequenced their GHS-R1a gene exons and performed association studies.
RESULTS: We found five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which did not 
change the amino acid sequence. We were unable to detect associations between 
the SNPs and the IGF-I plasma concentrations, but instead we showed that SNP 
171C>T was associated with the values of the area under the insulin curve 
(AUCIN) in an oral glucose tolerance test and with IGF-binding protein-1 
(IGFBP-1) concentrations (P<0.05). SNP 477G>A was associated with the low 
density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma levels 
and AUCIN values (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first genomic screening of the GHS-R1a gene in a 
population. It suggests that genetic variations in the GHS-R1a gene are not the 
main regulators of IGF-I levels. However, the variants may be associated with 
IGFBP-1 concentrations and insulin metabolism.
