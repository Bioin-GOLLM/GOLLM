Background Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) is a rare genetic 
vascular disorder caused by mutations in endoglin ( ENG ), activin receptor-like 
kinase 1 ( ACVRL 1; ALK 1), or SMAD 4. Major clinical symptoms of HHT are 
arteriovenous malformations ( AVM s) found in the brain, lungs, visceral organs, 
and mucosal surface. Animal models harboring mutations in Eng or Alk1 
recapitulate all of these HHT clinical symptoms and have been useful resources 
for studying mechanisms and testing potential drugs. However, animal models 
representing SMAD 4 mutations have been lacking. The goal of this study is to 
evaluate Smad4-inducible knockout ( iKO ) mice as an animal model of HHT and 
compare the phenotypes with other established HHT animal models. Methods and 
Results Global Smad4 deletion was induced at neonatal and adult stages, and 
hemoglobin levels, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and presence of aberrant 
arteriovenous connections were examined. Neonatal Smad4- iKO mice exhibited 
signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and AVM s in the brain, intestine, nose, and 
retina. The radial expansion was decreased, and AVM s were detected on both 
distal and proximal retinal vasculature of Smad4- iKO s. Aberrant smooth muscle 
actin staining was observed in the initial stage AVM s and their connecting 
veins, indicating abnormal arterial flow to veins. In adult mice, Smad4 
deficiency caused gastrointestinal bleeding and AVM s along the gastrointestinal 
tract and wounded skin. HHT -related phenotypes of Smad4- iKO s appeared to be 
comparable with those found in Alk1- iKO and Eng- iKO mice. Conclusions These 
data further confirm that SMAD signaling is crucial for normal arteriovenous 
network formation, and Smad4- iKO will be an alternative animal model of AVM 
research associated with HHT .
