OBJECTIVE: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a 
relentlessly progressing form of chronic kidney disease for which there is no 
cure. The aim of this study was to characterize Chinese patients with ADPKD and 
to identify the factors which predict cyst growth and renal functional 
deterioration.
METHODS: To analyze disease predicting factors we performed a prospective 
longitudinal observational study in a cohort of 541 Chinese patients with ADPKD 
and an eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Patients were followed clinically and 
radiologically with sequential abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were related to changes in 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and total kidney volume (TKV). A 
linear regression model was developed to analyze the factors which determine 
eGFR and TKV changes.
RESULTS: The age range of this unselected cohort ranged from 4 to 77 years. 
Median follow-up time was 14.3 ± 10.6 months. Although inter-individual 
differences in eGFR and TKV were large, there was a consistent link between 
these two parameters. Baseline log10-transformed TKV and urinary 
protein/creatinine ratio were identified as the major predictors for a faster 
eGFR decline and were associated with a higher TKV growth rate. Interestingly, a 
lower thrombocyte count correlated significantly with lower eGFR (r = 0.222) and 
higher TKV (r = 0.134).
CONCLUSIONS: This large cohort of Chinese patients with ADPKD provides unique 
epidemiological data for comparison with other cohorts of different ethnicity. 
In Chinese patients we identified a lower thrombocyte count as a significant 
predictor of disease progression. These results are important for the design of 
future clinical trials to retard polycystic kidney disease progression.
