Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons. ALS can be modeled in 
zebrafish (Danio rerio) through the expression of human ALS-causing genes, such 
as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Overexpression of mutated human SOD1 protein 
causes aberrant branching and shortening of spinal motor axons. Despite this, 
the functional relevance of this axon morphology remains elusive. Our aim was to 
determine whether this motor axonopathy is correlated with impaired movement in 
mutant (MT) SOD1-expressing zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish embryos that express 
blue fluorescent protein (mTagBFP) in motor neurons were injected with either 
wild-type (WT) or MT (A4V) human SOD1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). At 48 
hours post-fertilization, larvae movement (distance traveled during behavioral 
testing) was examined, followed by quantification of motor axon length. Larvae 
injected with MT SOD1 mRNA had significantly shorter and more aberrantly 
branched motor axons (p < 0.002) and traveled a significantly shorter distance 
during behavioral testing (p < 0.001) when compared with WT SOD1 and noninjected 
larvae. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between distance traveled 
and motor axon length (R2 = 0.357, p < 0.001). These data represent the first 
correlative investigation of motor axonopathies and impaired movement in 
SOD1-expressing zebrafish, confirming functional relevance and validating 
movement as a disease phenotype for the testing of disease treatments for ALS.
