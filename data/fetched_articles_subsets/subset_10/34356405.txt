This study investigates a critical hazard identification method for railway 
accident prevention. A new accident causation network is proposed to model the 
interaction between hazards and accidents. To realize consistency between the 
most likely and shortest causation paths in terms of hazards to accidents, a 
method for measuring the length between adjacent nodes is proposed, and the 
most-likely causation path problem is first transformed to the shortest 
causation path problem. To identify critical hazard factors that should be 
alleviated for accident prevention, a novel critical hazard identification model 
is proposed based on a controllability analysis of hazards. Five critical hazard 
identification methods are proposed to select critical hazard nodes in an 
accident causality network. A comparison of results shows that the combination 
of an integer programming-based critical hazard identification method and the 
proposed weighted direction accident causality network considering length has 
the best performance in terms of accident prevention.
