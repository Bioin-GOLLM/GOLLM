INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have suggested the involvement of chronic 
low-grade inflammation in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy (DNP). 
However, none of these studies have examined the levels of monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients 
with confirmed diagnosis of neuropathy. Therefore, the present study aims to 
investigate the levels of MCP-1 along with IL-6, IL-8 and TGF-β in patients with 
T2DM and confirmed neuropathy and identify correlations, if any, between MCP-1 
and other parameters.
METHODS: A single center cross-sectional clinical study was conducted at 
University Hospital Sharjah (UHS) and University of Sharjah. One hundred and two 
patients with T2DM were recruited from diabetes clinics at UHS and were 
stratified into different groups based on diagnosis of DNP and other parameters. 
Several analyses were conducted to evaluate and compare the levels of MCP-1, 
IL-6, IL-8, and TGF-β across these groups of patients and identify correlations, 
if any, between MCP-1 and other variables.
RESULTS: A significant increase was found in the levels of MCP-1 in T2DM 
patients with DNP compared to the patients without DNP (p=0.002, p-adj=0.007). 
Further analysis has shown that levels of IL-8 (p=0.008) and TGF-β (p=0.06) were 
increased and decreased, respectively, in patients with DNP compared to patients 
without DNP. Moreover, strong correlations were found between MCP-1, IL-8 and 
TGF-β levels.
CONCLUSION: The key finding of the present study is the significant elevation in 
levels of MCP-1 in T2DM patients with DNP compared to the patients without DNP 
and IL-8 and TGF-β were strong predictors of MCP-1 increased levels.
