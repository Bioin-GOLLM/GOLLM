Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an undesirable complication in the 
course of ovarian stimulation. This kind of stimulation is aimed at acquiring a 
sufficient number of high-quality oocytes in in vitro fertilization (IVF). 
Whereas the predisposition to OHSS could be impacted by genetic polymorphisms in 
susceptible genes, the present study has been jointly conducted with an Iranian 
cohort to scrutinize its relevant implication. Genomic DNA was extracted from 
blood samples of patients with a normal ovarian response (NOR) or with OHSS. 
Samples were analyzed to detect polymorphisms MTHFR rs1801131, MTHFR rs1801133, 
AMHR2 rs2002555, LHCGR rs2293275, PGR rs10895068, and SERPINE1 rs1799889. 
Variations of MTHFR, AMHR2, LHCGR, and PGR genes were significantly associated 
with the developing OHSS. After correction for multiple analysis, this 
difference was not evident for PGR genotypes. The polymorphic alleles of MTHFR 
(rs1801131 C-allele and rs1801133 T-allele), AMHR2 (rs2002555 G-allele), and 
LHCGR (rs2293275 G-allele) were significantly more prevalent among patients with 
OHSS compared to those in the NOR group. In contrast, the minor allele of PGR 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs10895068, A-allele) was more prominent 
among patients with a NOR than those with OHSS. No significant difference was 
observed in genotypes or alleles of SERPINE1 rs1799889. The observations 
indicated that the minor alleles of MTHFR, AMHR2, and LHCGR genes could be 
considered an independent risk factor in susceptibility to OHSS. Nevertheless, 
polymorphic allele in the PGR rs10895068 SNP contributes to preventing OHSS 
occurrence. Therefore, it can be argued that these genes have a significant 
impact on OHSS.
