Accurate quantitative estimates of protein-membrane interactions are critical to 
studies of membrane proteins. Here, we demonstrate that thermodynamic analyses 
based on current hydropathy scales do not account for the significant and 
experimentally determined effects that Ca2+ or Mg2+ have on protein-membrane 
interactions. We examined distinct modes of interaction (interfacial 
partitioning and folding and transmembrane insertion) by studying three highly 
divergent peptides: Bid-BH3 (derived from apoptotic regulator Bid), 
peripherin-2-derived prph2-CTER, and the cancer-targeting 
pH-Low-Insertion-Peptide (pHLIP). Fluorescence experiments demonstrate that 
adding 1-2 mM of divalent cations led to a substantially more favorable bilayer 
partitioning and insertion, with free energy differences of 5-15 kcal/mol.
