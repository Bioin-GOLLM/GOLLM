Development of Kinase-Selective, Harmine-Based DYRK1A Inhibitors that Induce 
Pancreatic Human β-Cell Proliferation.

DYRK1A has been implicated as an important drug target in various therapeutic 
areas, including neurological disorders and oncology. DYRK1A has more recently 
been shown to be involved in pathways regulating human β-cell proliferation, 
thus making it a potential therapeutic target for both Type 1 and Type 2 
diabetes. Our group, using a high-throughput phenotypic screen, identified 
harmine that is able to induce β-cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. 
Since harmine has suboptimal kinase selectivity, we sought to expand 
structure-activity relationships for harmine's DYRK1A activity, to enhance 
selectivity, while retaining human β-cell proliferation capability. We carried 
out the optimization of the 1-position of harmine and synthesized 15 harmine 
analogues. Six compounds showed excellent DYRK1A inhibition with IC50 in the 
range of 49.5-264 nM. Two compounds, 2-2 and 2-8, exhibited excellent human 
β-cell proliferation at doses of 3-30 μM, and compound 2-2 showed improved 
kinase selectivity as compared to harmine.
