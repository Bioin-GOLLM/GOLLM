BACKGROUND: Ischemic coronary heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of death 
worldwide. Genetic variation is presumed to be a major factor underlying sex 
differences for IHD events, including mortality. The purpose of this study was 
to identify sex-specific candidate genes associated with all-cause mortality 
among people diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: We performed a sex-stratified, exploratory genome-wide association 
(GWAS) screen using existing data from CAD-diagnosed males (n = 510) and females 
(n = 174) who reported European ancestry from the Duke Catheterization Genetics 
biorepository. Extant genotype data for 785,945 autosomal SNPs generated with 
the Human Omni1-Quad BeadChip (Illumina, CA, USA) were analyzed using an 
additive inheritance model. We estimated instantaneous risk of all-cause 
mortality by genotype groups across the 11-year follow-up using Cox multivariate 
regression, covarying for age and genomic ancestry.
RESULTS: The top GWAS hits associated with all-cause mortality among people with 
CAD included 8 SNPs among males and 15 among females (p = 1 Ã— 10-6 or 10-7), 
adjusted for covariates. Cross-sex comparisons revealed distinct candidate 
genes. Biologically relevant candidates included rs9932462 (EMP2/TEKT5) and 
rs2835913 (KCNJ6) among males and rs7217169 (RAP1GAP2), rs8021816 (PRKD1), 
rs8133010 (PDE9A), and rs12145981 (LPGAT1) among females.
CONCLUSIONS: We report 20 sex-specific candidate genes having suggestive 
association with all-cause mortality among CAD-diagnosed subjects. Findings 
demonstrate proof of principle for identifying sex-associated genetic factors 
that may help explain differential mortality risk in people with CAD. 
Replication and meta-analyses in larger studies with more diverse samples will 
strengthen future work in this area.
