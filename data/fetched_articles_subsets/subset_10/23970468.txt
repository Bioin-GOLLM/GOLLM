PURPOSE: To explore different molecular factors impairing the activities of 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms in senile cataractous lenses.
METHODS: Enzyme activity of SOD isoforms, levels of their corresponding 
cofactors copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and expression of mRNA 
transcripts and proteins were determined in the lenses of human subjects with 
and without cataract. DNA from lens epithelium (LE) and peripheral blood was 
isolated. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism 
(PCR-SSCP) followed by sequencing was carried out to screen somatic mutations. 
The impact of intronic insertion/deletion (INDEL) variations on the splicing 
process and on the resultant transcript was evaluated. Genotyping of IVS4+42delG 
polymorphism of SOD1 gene was done by PCR-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP).
RESULTS: A significant decrease in Cu/Zn- and Mn-SOD activity (P < 0.001) and in 
Cu/Zn-SOD transcript (P < 0.001) and its protein (P < 0.05) were found in 
cataractous lenses. No significant change in the level of copper (P = 0.36) and 
an increase in the level of manganese (P = 0.01) and zinc (P = 0.02) were 
observed in cataractous lenses. A significant positive correlation between the 
level of Cu/Zn-SOD activity and the levels of Cu (P = 0.003) and Zn (P = 0.005) 
was found in the cataractous lenses. DNA sequencing revealed three intronic 
INDEL variations in exon4 of SOD1 gene. Splice-junction analysis showed the 
potential of IVS4+42delG in creating a new cryptic acceptor site. If it is 
involved in alternate splicing, it could result in generation of SOD1 mRNA 
transcripts lacking exon4 region. Transcript analysis revealed the presence of 
complete SOD1 mRNA transcripts. Genotyping revealed the presence of IVS4+42delG 
polymorphism in all subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in the activity of SOD1 isoform in cataractous lenses 
was associated with the decreased level of mRNA transcripts and their protein 
expression and was not associated with either modulation in the level of enzyme 
cofactors or with INDEL variations.
