We report the sonographic diagnosis and molecular analysis of holoprosencephaly 
(HPE) and premaxillary agenesis in a second-trimester fetus with a 46,XY 
karyotype. Mutational sequence analyses for the entire coding region and 
exon-intron boundaries of SHH, ZIC2, SIX3 and TGIF genes identified a novel 
heterozygous missense TGIF mutation 268C-->T (CGC-->TGC change) that predicts an 
Arg90Cys substitution in the homeodomain region of TGIF. The proband's parents 
did not carry the mutation. The present case is an example of the heterogeneous 
entity of the HPE spectrum and demonstrates that adjunctive molecular analyses 
of distinct human genes for HPE can reassure genetic counselling by elucidating 
the genetic pathogenesis, especially in cytogenetically normal fetuses affected 
with HPE.
