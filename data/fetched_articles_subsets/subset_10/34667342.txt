BACKGROUND: Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TGN) is a chronic pain disorder 
causing unilateral, severe brief stabbing recurrent pain in the distribution of 
one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. Conventional radiofrequency (CRF) 
and pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) are two types of minimally invasive treatment. 
CRF selectively ablates the part of ganglion to provide the relief, but it has 
been found to be associated with some side effects such as dysesthesia or 
sensory loss in 6%-28% and loss of corneal reflex in 3%-8% of patients. PRF is a 
comparatively newer modality which is a nondestructive and neuromodulatory 
method of delivering radiofrequency energy to the gasserian ganglion to produce 
a therapeutic effect.
AIMS: We aimed to compare the efficacy of CRF with long-duration, fixed voltage 
PRF in the treatment of idiopathic TGN.
SETTING: This study was conducted in a tertiary care center research institute.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective randomized trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven adult patients of TGN were included in the 
study and randomly allocated into two groups (CRF and PRF). All procedures were 
performed operation suite with C-arm fluoroscopic guidance. Both, pre- and 
postprocedure, the patients were assessed for pain on the Visual Analog Scale 
(VAS) and Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) Pain Intensity Scale at 1 week and 
thereafter at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. Patients with a BNI score ≥4 after 1 month 
were considered a failure and offered other modes of treatment. A reduction in 
VAS score ≥50% and a BNI score <4 were considered as effective.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Discreet variables were recorded as proportions, ordinal 
variables and continuous variables with non-Gaussian distribution as medians 
with interquartile range, and continuous variables with Gaussian distribution as 
mean ± standard deviation. Association between ordinal variables was tested by 
Fisher's exact test/Chi-square test whenever appropriate. Equality of 
means/median was tested by using paired/unpaired t-test or nonparametric tests 
depending upon the distribution of data. P ≤ 0.5 was considered statistically 
significant. Data analysis was performed using STATA version 13.04 windows.
RESULTS: Efficacy in terms of decrease in VAS ≥50% at 1 month was 33.33% and 
83.33% in the PRF and CRF groups, respectively, which was statistically 
significant(P = 0.036). Effective reduction in BNI scores at the 7th day, 1 
month, and 2 months postprocedure was evaluated and found in 41.67% and 83.33% 
of patients in the PRF and CRF groups, respectively, which was statistically 
insignificant (P = 0.089). There was a statistically significant reduction in 
BNI scores in PRF and CRF group patients at 3 and 6 months (at 3 months, 33.33% 
and 83.33%, P = 0.036 and at 6 months, 25% and 83.33%, P = 0.012). In the CRF 
group, mild hypoesthesia was evident in three patients which improved by the end 
of 1 month while no side effects were seen in the PRF group.
CONCLUSION: CRF is a more effective procedure to decrease pain in comparison to 
long-duration, fixed voltage PRF for the treatment of idiopathic TGN. Although 
the side effects are more with CRF, they are mild and self-limiting.
