PURPOSE: In order to get novel EGFR inhibitors exerting more potency in tumor 
hypoxia than in normoxia.
METHODS: A series of 4-[(2-nitroimidazole-1H-alkyloxyl)aniline]-quinazolines 
were designed and synthesized, and their in vitro cytotoxicity and EGFR 
inhibitory activity were evaluated. Molecule docking study was performed for the 
representative compound.
RESULTS: The structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that 
compounds bearing both meta-chloride and para-(2-nitroimidazole-1H-alkyloxy) 
groups on the aniline displayed potent inhibitory activities both in enzymatic 
and cellular levels. The most promising compound 16i potently inhibited EGFR 
with an IC50 value of 0.12 μM. Meanwhile, it manifested more potent cytotoxicity 
than the positive control lapatinib under tumor normoxia and hypoxia conditions 
(IC50 values of 1.59 and 1.09 μM against A549 cells, 2.46 and 1.35 μM against 
HT-29 cells, respectively). The proposed binding model of 16i in complex with 
EGFR was displayed by the docking results.
CONCLUSION: This study provides insights for developing hypoxia-activated kinase 
inhibitors.
