Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by pathogenic 
variants in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). While CF is the most 
common hereditary disease in Caucasians, it is rare in East Asia. In the present 
study, we have examined clinical features and the spectrum of CFTR variants of 
CF patients in Japan. Clinical data of 132 CF patients were obtained from the 
national epidemiological survey since 1994 and CF registry. From 2007 to 2022, 
46 patients with definite CF were analyzed for CFTR variants. All exons, their 
boundaries, and part of promoter region of CFTR were sequenced and the presence 
of large deletion and duplications were examined by multiplex ligation-dependent 
probe amplification. CF patients in Japan were found to have chronic 
sinopulmonary disease (85.6%), exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (66.7%), 
meconium ileus (35.6%), electrolyte imbalance (21.2%), CF-associated liver 
disease (14.4%), and CF-related diabetes (6.1%). The median survival age was 
25.0 years. The mean BMI percentile was 30.3%ile in definite CF patients aged 
< 18 years whose CFTR genotypes were known. In 70 CF alleles of East Asia/Japan 
origin, CFTR-dele16-17a-17b was detected in 24 alleles, the other variants were 
novel or very rare, and no pathogenic variants were detected in 8 alleles. In 22 
CF alleles of Europe origin, F508del was detected in 11 alleles. In summary, 
clinical phenotype of Japanese CF patients is similar to European patients, but 
the prognosis is worse. The spectrum of CFTR variants in Japanese CF alleles is 
entirely different from that in European CF alleles.
