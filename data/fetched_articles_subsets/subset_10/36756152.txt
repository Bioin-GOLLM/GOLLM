BACKGROUND: High expression of matrix metalloproteinase-11 (MMP11) is associated 
with various tumors and immune microenvironments. Conversely, poor response to 
immunotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients is closely related to the characteristics of 
immune microenvironment.
METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUAD database and our gathered clinical 
LUAD samples were used to examine the relationship between MMP11 expression and 
EGFR mutation. Then the correlation between MMP11 and immune response and the 
difference of immune cell infiltration in different groups were analyzed. 
Compared the differences in the immune microenvironment between the 
MMP11-positive and MMP11-negative expression groups using immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and multiplex immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The expression of MMP11 in samples with exon 19 deletions, exon 21 
L858R or de novo exon 20 T790M mutations was higher than wild type, but there 
was no difference between the samples with uncommon mutation and the wild-type. 
The high MMP11 expression group had a higher Tumor Immune Dysfunction and 
Exclusion (TIDE) score. Pathways associated with enrichment in the extracellular 
matrix (ECM) were the main biological functions of differential genes between 
the high and low MMP11 groups. The IHC score of MMP11 in the EGFR-mutant group 
was higher than in the EGFR-wild group. In TCGA-LUAD, the high MMP11 group had a 
lower proportion of T cell CD8+ and NK cells activated. In the clinical samples, 
the infiltration levels of T cell CD8+ and NK cells in the tumor parenchyma of 
EGFR-mutant LUAD was lower in the MMP11-positive than in the MMP11-negative 
group. The expression levels of tumor cell PD-L1 were higher in the 
MMP11-positive expression group than in the MMP11-negative expression group, and 
the proportion of PD1+CD8+ T cells infiltrated was reduced in the MMP11-positive 
group compared to the MMP11-negative group.
CONCLUSIONS: High expression of MMP11 was associated with EGFR mutations. 
Patients with EGFR-mutant LUAD with high expression of MMP11 responded poorly to 
immunotherapy, and the percentage of T cell CD8+ and NK cells in immune cell 
infiltration was lower in MMP11. Consequently, MMP11 is related to the 
immunological microenvironment of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma, which may be 
a predictor of possible immunotherapeutic response.
