Stapling peptides for inhibiting the p53/MDM2 interaction is a promising 
strategy for developing anti-cancer therapeutic leads. We evaluate double-click 
stapled peptides formed from p53-based diazidopeptides with different staple 
positions and azido amino acid side-chain lengths, determining the impact of 
these variations on MDM2 binding and cellular activity. We also demonstrate a 
K24R mutation, necessary for cellular activity in hydrocarbon-stapled p53 
peptides, is not required for analogous 'double-click' peptides.
