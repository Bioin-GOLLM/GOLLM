BACKGROUND: Acute leukemia in newborns is also known as neonatal or congenital 
leukemia (CL) and is a rare disease with an incidence rate of 1-5 per 1000000 
live births. After birth, infants with CL exhibit infiltrative cutaneous 
nodules, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and immature leukocytes in the 
peripheral blood. These symptoms are frequently accompanied by congenital 
abnormalities including trisomy 21, trisomy 9, trisomy 13, or Turner syndrome. 
Despite significant advances in disease management, the survival rate is 
approximately 25% at 2 years.
CASE SUMMARY: Here, we document a case of trisomy 21-related acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) in a female neonate. The baby was sent to the neonatal intensive 
care unit because of anorexia, poor responsiveness, and respiratory distress. 
She was diagnosed with AML based on bone marrow aspiration and 
immunophenotyping. Genetic sequencing identified a mutation in the GATA1 gene. 
After receiving the diagnosis, the parents decided against medical care for 
their child, and the baby died at home on day 9 after birth.
CONCLUSIONS: The newborn infant was diagnosed with trisomy 21-related AML. 
Genetic sequencing identified a mutation in the GATA1 gene. The parents 
abandoned medical treatment for their infant after receiving the diagnosis, and 
the infant died at home on the 9th day after birth.
