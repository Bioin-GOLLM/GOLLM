Macroautophagy has important physiological roles and its cytoprotective or 
detrimental function is compromised in various diseases such as many cancers and 
metabolic diseases. However, the importance of autophagy for cell responses has 
also been demonstrated in many other physiological and pathological situations. 
In this review, we discuss some of the recently discovered mechanisms involved 
in specific and unspecific autophagy related to mitochondrial dysfunction and 
organelle degradation, lipid metabolism and lipophagy as well as recent findings 
and evidence that link autophagy to unconventional protein secretion.
