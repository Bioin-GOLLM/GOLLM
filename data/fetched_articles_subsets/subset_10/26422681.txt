BACKGROUND: The prothrombotic effect of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) is 
well-established, with a 3-6-fold increased risk of VTE compared to non-users. 
When initiation of COCs is considered, it is therefore of paramount importance 
to carefully evaluate all other potential risk factors for VTE. Based on a case 
of life-threatening COC-associated pulmonary embolism in a girl heterozygous for 
the prothrombin G20210A mutation and with a family history of thrombotic 
disease, we discuss the importance of assessing not just the genotype but also 
the phenotype when considering initiation of COCs in patients with 
thrombophilia.
CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old girl presented with acute onset of chest pain and 
dyspnea followed by syncope. She was hypoxic and hemodynamically compromised at 
admission. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography revealed a large central 
"saddle" pulmonary embolism causing nearly total occlusion of the right 
pulmonary artery, and several minor peripheral embolisms bilaterally. She was 
successfully treated with thrombolysis (alteplase) followed by aPTT-adjusted 
heparin infusion until adequate anticoagulation with warfarin was achieved. Two 
years earlier, the patient had been found heterozygote for the prothrombin 
G20210A mutation, and 9 months before admission she had initiated use of 
second-generation COCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Hereditary thrombophilia and a family history of early-onset venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) each pose an increased risk of VTE and should be 
considered as separate, irreversible risk factors. Other contraceptive methods 
should be used when treatment with COCs is expected to result in an unacceptable 
high risk of VTE.
