miR-122, the expression of which is regulated by several transcription factors, 
such as HNF1A, was recently reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes 
(T2DM) and hepatocellular carcinoma. HNF1A variants can cause diabetes and might 
be involved in the development of primary liver neoplasm. Differences in miR-122 
expression among different types of diabetes have not been studied. This study 
aimed to investigate differences in serum miR-122 levels in Chinese patients 
with different forms of diabetes, including T2DM, type 1 diabetes (T1DM), HNF1A 
variant-induced diabetes (HNF1A-DM), glucokinase variant-induced diabetes 
(GCK-DM), and mitochondrial A3243G mutation-induced diabetes (MDM). In total, 12 
HNF1A-DM patients, 24 gender-, age-, and body mass index-matched (1 : 2) T2DM 
patients and 24 healthy subjects were included in this study. In addition, 30 
monogenic diabetes (11 GCK-DM and 19 MDM) and 17 T1DM patients were included. 
Fasted blood biochemistry and miR-122 were measured. The results showed that the 
HNF1A-DM patients had lower miR-122 levels [0.046 (0.023, 0.121)] than T2DM 
patients [0.165 (0.036, 0.939), P = 0.02] and healthy controls [0.249 (0.049, 
1.234), P = 0.019]. The area under the curve of the receiver operating 
characteristic curve for miR-122 to discriminate HNF1A-DM and T2DM was 0.687 
(95% CI: 0.52-0.86, P = 0.07). There was no difference in serum miR-122 among 
HNF1A-DM, GCK-DM, MDM, and T1DM patients. Lower serum miR-122 is a unique 
feature of HNF1A-DM patients and might partially explain the increased risk for 
liver neoplasm and abnormal lipid metabolism in HNF1A-DM patients.
