A 44-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of recurrent thrombosis. 
Laboratory findings showed that he had antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) 
associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Plasminogen activity was reduced 
(21%), but its antigenic level was rather elevated (16.4 mg/dl). The discrepancy 
of plasminogen activity and antigen levels was also found in his three 
daughters. Gene analysis revealed a homozygous missense mutation (Ala601-->Thr) 
at exon 15 of the plasminogen gene in the patient and a heterozygous mutation in 
his three daughters, suggesting that the patient has dysplasminogenaemia, which 
was reported as "plasminogen Tochigi." Although it still remains controversial 
whether both dysplasminogenaemia and plasminogen deficiency are relevant 
independent thrombotic risk factors, the combination of this deficiency and APS 
should be considered as a strong predisposition to thrombosis in this patient.
