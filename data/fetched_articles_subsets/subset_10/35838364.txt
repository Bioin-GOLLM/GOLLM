As more atomic structures are determined from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 
density maps, validation of such structures is an important task. We report 
findings after analyzing the change of cryo-EM structures in a comparison 
between those released by December 2016 and those released between 2017 and 
2019. The cryo-EM models created from density maps with resolution better than 6 
Å were divided into six data sets. A histogram-based outlier score (HBOS) was 
implemented and validation reports were collected from the Protein Data Bank. 
The results suggest that the overall quality of EM structures released after 
December 2016 is better than that of structures released before 2017. The 
conformation qualities of most residue types might have been improved, except 
for Leucine, Phenylalanine, and Serine in high-resolution datasets (higher than 
4 Å). We observe that structures solved from 0-4 Å resolution density maps have 
an almost identical HBOS profile as that of structures derived from density maps 
with 4-6 Å resolution.
