Face masks and respirators are the most widely used intervention measures for 
respiratory protection. In the wake of COVID-19, in response to shortages and 
lack of availability of surgical masks and respirators, the use of cloth masks 
has become a research focus. Various fabrics have been promoted with little 
evidence-based foundation and without guidelines on design principles for 
optimal performance. In these circumstances, it is essential to understand the 
properties, key performance factors, filter mechanisms and evidence on cloth 
masks materials. The general community might also need to decontaminate and 
reuse disposable, single-use devices as a last resort. We present an overview of 
the filter materials, filter mechanisms and effectiveness, key performance 
factors, and hydrophobicity of the common disposable masks, as well as cloth 
masks. We also reviewed decontamination methods for disposable respiratory 
devices. As an alternative to surgical masks and respirators, we recommend a 
cloth mask made of at least three layers (300-350 threads per inch) and adding a 
nylon stocking layer over the mask for a better fit. Water-resistant fabrics 
(polyesters/nylon), blends of fabrics and water-absorbing fabrics (cotton) 
should be in the outside layer, middle layer/layers and inside layer, 
respectively. The information outlined here will help people to navigate their 
choices if facing shortages of appropriate respiratory protection during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
