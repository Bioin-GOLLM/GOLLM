BACKGROUND: Both propofol and thiamylal inhibit adenosine triphosphate-sensitive 
potassium (KATP) channels. In the current study, the authors investigated the 
effects of these anesthetics on the activity of recombinant sarcolemmal KATP 
channels encoded by inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) 
genes and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1, SUR2A, or SUR2B) genes.
METHODS: The authors used inside-out patch clamp configurations to investigate 
the effects of propofol and thiamylal on the activity of recombinant KATP 
channels using COS-7 cells transfected with various types of KATP channel 
subunits.
RESULTS: Propofol inhibited the activities of the SUR1/Kir6.2 (EC50 = 77 
microm), SUR2A/Kir6.2 (EC50 = 72 microm), and SUR2B/Kir6.2 (EC50 = 71 microm) 
channels but had no significant effects on the SUR2B/Kir6.1 channels. Propofol 
inhibited the truncated isoform of Kir6.2 (Kir6.2DeltaC36) channels (EC50 = 78 
microm) that can form functional KATP channels in the absence of SUR molecules. 
Furthermore, the authors identified two distinct mutations R31E (arginine 
residue at position 31 to glutamic acid) and K185Q (lysine residue at position 
185 to glutamine) of the Kir6.2DeltaC36 channel that significantly reduce the 
inhibition of propofol. In contrast, thiamylal inhibited the SUR1/Kir6.2 (EC50 = 
541 microm), SUR2A/Kir6.2 (EC50 = 248 microm), SUR2B/Kir6.2 (EC50 = 183 microm), 
SUR2B/Kir6.1 (EC50 = 170 microm), and Kir6.2DeltaC36 channels (EC50 = 719 
microm). None of the mutants significantly affects the sensitivity of thiamylal.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the major effects of both propofol and 
thiamylal on KATP channel activity are mediated via the Kir6.2 subunit. 
Site-directed mutagenesis study suggests that propofol and thiamylal may 
influence Kir6.2 activity by different molecular mechanisms; in thiamylal, the 
SUR subunit seems to modulate anesthetic sensitivity.
