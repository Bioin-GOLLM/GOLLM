BACKGROUND/AIMS: Vitreous haemorrhage (VH) and retinal detachment (RD) cause a 
precipitous decline in vision in a subset of patients with X-linked 
retinoschisis (XLRS), an otherwise a slowly progressive condition. This study 
aims to report the frequency of macular and peripheral retinal findings in a 
large cohort of patients with XLRS and to determine whether peripheral retinal 
findings are associated with VH and RD.
METHODS: A retrospective observational case series was performed in 65 patients 
with XLRS with a pathogenic variant in retinoschisin 1. Chart review included 
examination notes, fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT). 
Fisher exact tests and univariable logistic regression analysis were used to 
determine the association between peripheral retinal findings (including 
retinoschisis, metallic sheen, vascular sheathing, pigmentary changes, white 
spiculations and vitreous veils) and complications (including VH and RD).
RESULTS: Seven eyes (8%) showed normal macular structure on OCT. Peripheral 
retinoschisis was significantly associated with both VH and RD. Out of 10 eyes 
with complications, 9 (90%) had peripheral retinoschisis, compared with 33 out 
of 116 eyes (28%) without complications (p=0.0014). In addition, each additional 
peripheral finding increased the odds of RD by a factor of 4.06 (95% CI 1.58 to 
10.39, p=0.028). There were no complications in the 28 eyes with a normal 
periphery (p=0.84) or in the 35 eyes with metallic sheen (p=0.42).
CONCLUSION: The data suggest that patients with peripheral retinoschisis are at 
increased risk for VH and RD. Furthermore, patients with additional peripheral 
retinal findings together with peripheral schisis may carry additional risk for 
RD.
