Fluorescent proteins are widely used to study molecular and cellular events, yet 
this traditionally relies on delivery of excitation light, which can trigger 
autofluorescence, photoxicity, and photobleaching, impairing their use in vivo. 
Accordingly, chemiluminescent light sources such as those generated by 
luciferases have emerged, as they do not require excitation light. However, 
current luciferase reporters lack the brightness needed to visualize events in 
deep tissues. We report the creation of chimeric eGFP-NanoLuc (GpNLuc) and 
LSSmOrange-NanoLuc (OgNLuc) fusion reporter proteins coined LumiFluors, which 
combine the benefits of eGFP or LSSmOrange fluorescent proteins with the bright, 
glow-type bioluminescent light generated by an enhanced small luciferase subunit 
(NanoLuc) of the deep-sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris. The intramolecular 
bioluminescence resonance energy transfer that occurs between NanoLuc and the 
fused fluorophore generates the brightest bioluminescent signal known to date, 
including improved intensity, sensitivity, and durable spectral properties, 
thereby dramatically reducing image acquisition times and permitting highly 
sensitive in vivo imaging. Notably, the self-illuminating and bifunctional 
nature of these LumiFluor reporters enables greatly improved spatiotemporal 
monitoring of very small numbers of tumor cells via in vivo optical imaging and 
also allows the isolation and analyses of single cells by flow cytometry. Thus, 
LumiFluor reporters are inexpensive, robust, noninvasive tools that allow for 
markedly improved in vivo optical imaging of tumorigenic processes.
