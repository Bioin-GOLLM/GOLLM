BACKGROUND: Osimertinib is a potent third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI) with robust activity in advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), including those with T790M resistance mutation. However, a broad 
interpatient variability was observed. This study aimed to evaluate whether 
EGFR-mutant genotypes affect the clinical outcomes and resistance mechanisms in 
T790M-positive NSCLC patients receiving osimertinib therapy.
METHODS: All NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib in our institute were 
screened. We included those with known EGFR-mutant genotypes and T790M 
positivity. Clinical outcomes including objective response rate (ORR), clinical 
benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), 
were evaluated and compared between different EGFR genotypes. Patients with 
next-generation sequencing testing or tumor rebiopsy after osimertinib treatment 
were analyzed for resistance mechanisms.
RESULTS: ORR, CBR, PFS, and OS were all non-significantly different among 
patients harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion (19Del, n=136), L858R (n=93), and 
uncommon mutations (n=6). However, a subset of tumors with deletion starting at 
E746 (ΔE746, n=98), but not non-ΔE746 tumors (n=38), had better clinical 
outcomes than L858R tumors (n=93). Frequencies of T790M loss and C797S 
acquisition after osimertinib treatment were similar between 19Del (n=56) and 
L858R tumors (n=33). However, compared with L858R tumors (n=33), those with 
19Del ΔE746 subtype (n=40) had a higher whereas non-ΔE746 subtype (n=16) had a 
similar frequency of acquired C797S mutation. Combined analysis of our cohort 
and public cohort confirmed these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the EGFR 19Del subtypes affect the 
clinical outcomes and resistance mechanisms to osimertinib in T790M-positive 
patients. Identifying patients with relatively worse treatment outcomes may be 
informative for establishing new therapies for these patients.
