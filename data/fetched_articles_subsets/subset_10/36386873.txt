Fruit flies sense the features of food that are driven by particle size, 
including smoothness versus grittiness, by deflection of sensilla decorating the 
labellum, and md-L neurons. We describe adaptation of the Drosophila proboscis 
extension response assay, including steps to perform the taste tests and score 
behavioral responses, to determine preferences to foods with different sized 
particles. We also describe calcium imaging in GCaMP-expressing flies to assess 
the responses of md-L neurons to different levels of taste sensilla deflection.
