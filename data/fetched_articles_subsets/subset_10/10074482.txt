Excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle of familial hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (FHC) remains poorly understood, despite the fact that the 
genetic alterations are well defined. We characterized calcium cycling and 
contractile activation in trabeculae from a mutant mouse model of FHC (Arg403Gln 
knockin, alpha-myosin heavy chain). Wild-type mice of the same strain and age ( 
approximately 20 weeks old) served as controls. During twitch contractions, peak 
intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was higher in mutant muscles than in the wild-type 
(P < 0.05), but force development was equivalent in the two groups. Ca2+ 
transient amplitude increased dramatically in both groups as stimulation rate 
increased from 0.2 to 4 Hz. Nevertheless, developed force fell at the higher 
stimulation rates in the mutants but not in controls (P < 0.05). The 
steady-state force-[Ca2+]i relationship was less steep in mutants (Hill 
coefficient, 2.94 +/- 0.27 vs. 5.28 +/- 0.64; P > 0.003), with no changes in the 
[Ca2+]i required for 50% activation or maximal Ca2+-activated force. Thus, 
calcium cycling and myofilament properties are both altered in FHC mutant mice: 
more Ca2+ is mobilized to generate force, but this does not suffice to maintain 
contractility at high stimulation rates.
