The aging of the population is an increasingly serious issue, and many 
age-related illnesses are on the rise. These illnesses pose a serious threat to 
the health and safety of elderly individuals and create a serious economic and 
social burden. Despite substantial research into the pathogenesis of these 
diseases, their etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. In recent decades, 
rodent models have been used in attempts to elucidate these disorders, but such 
models fail to simulate the full range of symptoms. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are 
the most ideal neuroscientific models for studying the human brain and are more 
functionally similar to humans because of their high genetic similarities and 
phenotypic characteristics in comparison with humans. Here, we review the 
literature examining typical NHP brain disease models, focusing on NHP models of 
common diseases such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. We also 
explore the application of electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), and optogenetic study methods on NHPs and neural circuits 
associated with cognitive impairment.
