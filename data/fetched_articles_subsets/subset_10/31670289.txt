OBJECTIVE: This study is to explore the determining factors for testing 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK) fusion after subtyping by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using samples 
obtained from endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration 
(EBUS-TBNA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients suspected with advanced lung cancer were 
performed EBUS-TBNA without rapid on-site evaluation(ROSE) from January 2015 to 
March 2016 in Shanghai Chest Hospital. All samples diagnosed as lung cancer by 
histopathology underwent IHC to identify subtypes. EGFR mutation and ALK fusion 
were tested in adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer-not otherwise 
specified (NSCLC-NOS) using remnant tissue samples.
RESULTS: A total of 453 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer, including 
44.15% (200/453) with adenocarcinoma and 11.04% (50/453) with NSCLC-NOS. With 
the average passes of 3.41 Â± 0.68, samples obtained from EBUS-TBNA were adequate 
for performing EGFR mutation and ALK fusion gene analysis in 80.4% (201/250) of 
specimens after routine IHC. On univariate analysis, successful molecular 
testing was associated with passes per lesion (P = 3.80E-05), long-axis 
diameters (P = 6.00E-06) and short-axis diameters (P = 4.77E-04), and pathology 
subtypes of lesions (P = 3.00E-03). Multivariate logistic regression revealed 
that passes per lesion (P = 1.00E-03), long-axis diameters (P = 3.50E-02), and 
pathology subtypes (P = 8.00E-03) were independent risk factors associated with 
successful molecular testing.
CONCLUSIONS: With at least three passes of per lesion, EBUS-TBNA is an efficient 
method to provide adequate samples for testing of EGFR mutation and ALK gene 
arrangement following routine histopathology and IHC subtyping. Determining 
factors associated with successful pathology subtyping and molecular testing 
using samples obtained by EBUS-TBNA are passes of per lesion, long-axis 
diameter, and pathology subtypes. During the process of EBUS-TBNA, selecting 
larger lymph nodes and the puncturing at least 3 passes per lesion may result in 
higher success rate in lung cancer subtyping and molecular testing.
