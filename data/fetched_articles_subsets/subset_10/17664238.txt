Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by 
overexpression of cytokines and T cell accessory molecules, which is due to a 
reduction of DNA regulatory region methylation in T cells. It has been shown 
that polymorphic variants of genes encoding key enzymes of folate and methionine 
metabolism may have an effect on DNA methylation. Therefore, in patients with 
SLE (n = 106) and controls (n = 141) we examined the distribution of 
polymorphisms of genes encoding methionine synthase (MTR); 
5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate 
cyclohydrolase and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFD1); and 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). We found that MTR 2756AG (919DG) or 
GG (919GG) genotype exhibited 2.005-fold increased risk of SLE (95% CI = 
1.177-3.416, P = 0.0146). However, MTHFR 677C > T (A222V) and MTHFD1 1958G > A 
(R653Q) allele and genotype frequencies did not exhibit statistical differences 
between SLE patients and controls. Since MTR is located on 1q43, our findings 
confirm the significance of the role of 1q region and the methyl cycle in 
etiopathogenesis of SLE.
