Mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding β-catenin, are common in colon and liver 
cancers, the most frequent mutation affecting Ser-45 in β-catenin. Peptides 
derived from WT β-catenin have previously been shown to be presented on the cell 
surface as part of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, suggesting an 
opportunity for targeting this common driver gene mutation with antibody-based 
therapies. Here, crystal structures of both the WT and S45F mutant peptide bound 
to HLA-A*03:01 at 2.20 and 2.45 Å resolutions, respectively, confirmed the 
accessibility of the phenylalanine residue for antibody recognition. Phage 
display was then used to identify single-chain variable fragment clones that 
selectively bind the S45F mutant peptide presented in HLA-A*03:01 and have 
minimal WT or other off-target binding. Following the initial characterization 
of five clones, we selected a single clone, E10, for further investigation. We 
developed a computational model of the binding of E10 to the mutant 
peptide-bound HLA-A3, incorporating data from affinity maturation as initial 
validation. In the future, our model may be used to design clones with 
maintained specificity and higher affinity. Such derivatives could be adapted 
into either cell-based (CAR-T) or protein-based (bispecific T-cell engagers) 
therapies to target cancer cells harboring the S45F mutation in CTNNB1.
