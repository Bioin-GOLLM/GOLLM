Activating BRAF (V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) mutations occur 
in approximately 5% to 10% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, mostly 
V600E mutation, and it is associated with distinct clinical and pathological 
features. To date, there are no approved treatments to target this mutation. 
BRAF inhibitor monotherapy has limited efficacy, in contrast to metastatic 
melanoma. Combination strategies that block not only BRAF mutated kinase but 
other alternative pathways are ongoing and have demonstrated improved activity. 
This review aims to provide data about new strategies to target to BRAF gene 
mutation in metastatic colorectal cancer.
