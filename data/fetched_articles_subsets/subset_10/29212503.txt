BACKGROUND: Recurrence with distant metastases has become the predominant 
pattern of failure in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), thus the 
integration of new antineoplastic agents into preoperative 
fluoropyrimidine-based chemo-radiotherapy represents a clinical challenge to 
implement an intensified therapeutic strategy. The present study examined the 
combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) valproic acid (VPA) 
with fluoropyrimidine-based chemo-radiotherapy on colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.
METHODS: HCT-116 (p53-wild type), HCT-116 p53-/- (p53-null), SW620 and HT29 
(p53-mutant) CRC cell lines were used to assess the antitumor interaction 
between VPA and capecitabine metabolite 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) in 
combination with radiotherapy and to evaluate the role of p53 in the combination 
treatment. Effects on proliferation, clonogenicity and apoptosis were evaluated, 
along with γH2AX foci formation as an indicator for DNA damage.
RESULTS: Combined treatment with equipotent doses of VPA and 5'-DFUR resulted in 
synergistic effects in CRC lines expressing p53 (wild-type or mutant). In 
HCT-116 p53-/- cells we observed antagonist effects. Radiotherapy further 
potentiated the antiproliferative, pro-apoptotic and DNA damage effects induced 
by 5'-DFUR/VPA combination in p53 expressing cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlighted the role of VPA as valuable candidate to 
be added to preoperative chemo-radiotherapy in LARC. On these bases we launched 
the ongoing phase I/II study of VPA and short-course radiotherapy plus 
capecitabine as preoperative treatment in low-moderate risk rectal cancer 
(V-shoRT-R3).
