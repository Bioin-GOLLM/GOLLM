Transcription-translation coupling leads to the production of proteins that are 
key for controlling essential neuronal processes that include neuronal 
development and changes in synaptic strength. Although these events have been a 
prevailing theme in neuroscience, the regulation of proteins via 
posttranslational signaling pathways are equally relevant for these neuronal 
processes. Ubiquitin is one type of posttranslational modification that 
covalently attaches to its targets/substrates. Ubiquitination of proteins play a 
key role in multiple signaling pathways, the predominant being removal of its 
substrates by a large molecular machine called the proteasome. Here, I review 40 
years of progress on ubiquitination in the nervous system at glutamatergic 
synapses focusing on axon pathfinding, synapse formation, presynaptic release, 
dendritic spine formation, and regulation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. 
Finally, I elucidate emerging themes in ubiquitin biology that may challenge our 
current understanding of ubiquitin signaling in the nervous system.
