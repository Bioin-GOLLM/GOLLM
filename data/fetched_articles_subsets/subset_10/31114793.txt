GATA transcription factors (TFs) are a conserved family of zinc-finger TFs that 
fulfill diverse functions across eukaryotes. Accumulating evidence suggests that 
GATA TFs also play a role in lifespan regulation. In a recent study, we have 
identified a natural compound, 4,4' dimethoxychalcone (DMC) that extends 
lifespan depending on reduced activity of distinct GATA TFs. Prolonged lifespan 
by DMC treatment depends on autophagy, a protective cellular self-cleaning 
mechanism. In yeast, DMC reduces the activity of the GATA TF Gln3 and, at the 
same time, deletion of GLN3 increases autophagy levels during cellular aging per 
se. Here, we examine current data on the involvement of GATA TFs in the 
regulation of both autophagy and lifespan in different organisms and explore, if 
GATA TFs are suitable targets for anti-aging interventions.
