Since the first prominent description of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor 
15 (GPR15) on lymphocytes as a co-receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) type 1 and 2 and the first report about the GPR15-triggered cytoprotective 
effect on vascular endothelial cells by recombinant human thrombomodulin, 
several decades passed before the GPR15 has been recently deorphanized. Because 
of new findings on GPR15, this review will summarize the consequences of GPR15 
signaling considering the variety of GPR15-expressing cell types and of GPR15 
ligands, with a focus on blood and vasculature.
