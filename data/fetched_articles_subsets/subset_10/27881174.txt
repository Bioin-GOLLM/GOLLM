BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological origin of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) 
is largely unknown. However, individuals with presumably pathogenic mutations in 
FAMIN have been reported, associating this gene with a rare subtype of this 
disorder. FAMIN, that is formerly also referred to as LACC1 or C13orf31, has 
recently been shown to play a crucial role in immune-metabolic functions and is 
involved in regulation of inflammasome activation and promotion of ROS 
production.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe two siblings with severe familial forms of 
juvenile arthritis in which whole-exome-sequencing revealed a novel homozygous 
frameshift mutation (NM_153218.2:c.827delC¸. p.(T276fs*2) in FAMIN.
CONCLUSIONS: The observation of a new deleterious mutation adds further evidence 
that pathogenic mutations in FAMIN are causal for a monogenic form of JIA. 
Furthermore the associated phenotype is not restricted to systemic JIA, but can 
also be found in other forms of familial juvenile arthritis.
