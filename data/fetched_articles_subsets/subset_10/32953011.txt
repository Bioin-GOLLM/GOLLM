Rational design of protein-polymer bioconjugates is hindered by limited 
experimental data and mechanistic understanding on interactions between the two. 
In this communication, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) paramagnetic relaxation 
enhancement (PRE) reports on distances between paramagnetic spin labels and NMR 
active nuclei, informing on the conformation of conjugated polymers. 
1H/15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra were collected 
for ubiquitin (Ub) modified with block copolymers incorporating spin labels at 
different positions along their backbone. The resultant PRE data show that the 
conjugated polymers have conformations biased towards the nonpolar β-sheet face 
of Ub, rather than behaving as if in solution. The bioconjugates are stabilized 
against denaturation by guanidine-hydrochloride, as measured by circular 
dichroism (CD), and this stabilization is attributed to the interaction between 
the protein and conjugated polymer.
