AIM: This study is aimed at comparing gastric cancer T and N staging between 
virtual monochromatic energy images and fusion images generated by dual-source 
computed tomography (DSCT) dual-energy mode data acquisition prospectively while 
measuring the iodine concentration of gastric cancer and lymph nodes at 
different T and N stages from iodine map retrospectively.
METHODS: A total of 71 patients (50 males and 21 females; mean age: 59 ± 11 
years) confirmed with gastric cancer by endoscopic biopsy with no neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy were enrolled for the CT examination before surgeries. The 
preoperative T and N staging results were compared between groups with 
pathological results as the gold standard. The iodine concentrations of the 
gastric lesions and LNs were measured on the iodine-based material decomposition 
images. All iodine concentration values were normalized against those in the 
abdominal aorta and defined as normalized iodine concentration (nIC) values. The 
short axis length of LNs and nIC values were statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: Group A was better than group B for T3 and T4 staging. No statistically 
significant difference in the overall accuracies for N staging was found between 
groups. For the late arterial and delayed phases, T3 and T4 nIC values of the 
extraserosal adipose tissue showed statistically significant differences. The 
nIC values between N0 and Nm (N1-N3) showed statistically significant 
differences in the portal phase only.
CONCLUSIONS: T3 and T4 nIC values of the extraserosal adipose tissue showed 
statistically significant differences. Hence, dual-source CT may be helpful in 
the differential diagnosis between T3 and T4.
