BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis in Ethiopia is a re-emerging threat to public 
health, with increased geographical distribution and number of cases. It is a 
fatal disease without early diagnosis and treatment; thus, the availability of 
affordable diagnostic tools is crucial. However, due to delays caused by import 
regulations, procurement and late delivery of imported test kits, accessibility 
remains a problem in the control program. Therefore, we aimed to produce and 
evaluate the performance of an in-house liquid (AQ) direct agglutination test 
(DAT) antigen.
RESULT: The AQ-DAT was produced at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute, using 
Leishmania donovani strain (MHOM/ET/67/L82). Sera from 272 participants; 110 
microscopically confirmed cases of VL, 76 apparently healthy and 86 patients who 
had infectious disease other than VL were tested with AQ-DAT, and standard kits: 
Freeze-dried DAT (FD-DAT) and rK39. Taking microscopy as a gold standard; the 
sensitivity and specificity of the AQ-DAT were 97.3 and 98.8%, respectively. It 
had high degrees of agreement (k > 0.8), with a significant (P < 0.05) 
correlation compared to microscopy, FD-DAT, and rK39.
CONCLUSION: Although further standardization is required, the in-house AQ-DAT 
could improve diagnostic accessibility, minimize intermittent stock outs and 
strengthen the national VL control program.
