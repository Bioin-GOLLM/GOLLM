PURPOSE: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) is increasingly used as a diagnostic tool 
in medicine, but prior reports focus on predominantly pediatric cohorts with 
neurologic or developmental disorders. We describe the diagnostic yield and 
characteristics of WES in adults.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive WES reports for 
adults from a diagnostic laboratory. Phenotype composition was determined using 
Human Phenotype Ontology terms.
RESULTS: Molecular diagnoses were reported for 17.5% (85/486) of adults, which 
is lower than that for a primarily pediatric population (25.2%; P = 0.0003); the 
diagnostic rate was higher (23.9%) for those 18-30 years of age compared to 
patients older than 30 years (10.4%; P = 0.0001). Dual Mendelian diagnoses 
contributed to 7% of diagnoses, revealing blended phenotypes. Diagnoses were 
more frequent among individuals with abnormalities of the nervous system, 
skeletal system, head/neck, and growth. Diagnostic rate was independent of 
family history information, and de novo mutations contributed to 61.4% of 
autosomal dominant diagnoses.
CONCLUSION: Early WES experience in adults demonstrates molecular diagnoses in a 
substantial proportion of patients, informing clinical management, recurrence 
risk, and recommendations for relatives. A positive family history was not 
predictive, consistent with molecular diagnoses often revealed by de novo 
events, informing the Mendelian basis of genetic disease in adults.Genet Med 18
