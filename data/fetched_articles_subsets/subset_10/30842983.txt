Approximately 15% of all human tumors harbor mutant KRAS, a membrane-associated 
small GTPase and notorious oncogene. Mutations that render KRAS constitutively 
active will lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. However, despite 
aggressive efforts in recent years, there are no drugs on the market that 
directly target KRAS and inhibit its aberrant functions. In the current work, we 
combined structure-based design with a battery of cell and biophysical assays to 
discover a novel pyrazolopyrimidine-based allosteric KRAS inhibitor that binds 
to activated KRAS with sub-micromolar affinity and disrupts effector binding, 
thereby inhibiting KRAS signaling and cancer cell growth. These results show 
that pyrazolopyrimidine-based compounds may represent a first-in-class 
allosteric noncovalent inhibitors of KRAS. Moreover, by studying two of its 
analogues, we identified key chemical features of the compound that interact 
with a set of specific residues at the switch regions of KRAS and play critical 
roles for its high-affinity binding and unique mode of action, thus providing a 
blueprint for future optimization efforts.
