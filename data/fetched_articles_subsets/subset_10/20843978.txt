OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern on cardiometabolic risks in type 2 diabetic 
patients.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized crossover clinical trial was 
undertaken in 31 type 2 diabetic patients. For 8 weeks, participants were 
randomly assigned to a control diet or the DASH eating pattern.
RESULTS: After following the DASH eating pattern, body weight (P = 0.007) and 
waist circumference (P = 0.002) reduced significantly. Fasting blood glucose 
levels and A1C decreased after adoption of the DASH diet (-29.4 ± 6.3 mg/dl; P = 
0.04 and -1.7 ± 0.1%; P = 0.04, respectively). After the DASH diet, the mean 
change for HDL cholesterol levels was higher (4.3 ± 0.9 mg/dl; P = 0.001) and 
LDL cholesterol was reduced (-17.2 ± 3.5 mg/dl; P = 0.02). Additionally, DASH 
had beneficial effects on systolic (-13.6 ± 3.5 vs. -3.1 ± 2.7 mmHg; P = 0.02) 
and diastolic blood pressure (-9.5 ± 2.6 vs. -0.7 ± 3.3 mmHg; P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Among diabetic patients, the DASH diet had beneficial effects on 
cardiometabolic risks.
