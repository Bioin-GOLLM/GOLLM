BACKGROUND: Little is known about risk factors for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma 
(RMS) and the histology-specific details are rare.
METHODS: Case-control studies formed by linking cancer and birth registries of 
California, Minnesota, New York, Texas and Washington, which included 583 RMS 
cases (363 embryonal and 85 alveolar RMS) and 57 966 randomly selected control 
subjects, were analysed using logistic regression. The associations of RMS 
(overall, and based on embryonal or alveolar histology) with birth weight across 
five 500 g categories (from 2000 to 4500 g) were examined using normal birth 
weight (2500-3999 g) as a reference. Large (>90th percentile) and small (<10th 
percentile) size for gestational age were calculated based on birth weight 
distributions in controls and were similarly examined.
RESULTS: High birth weight increased the risk of embryonal RMS and RMS overall. 
Each 500 g increase in birth weight increased the risk of embryonal RMS (odds 
ratio (OR)=1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.14-1.42) and RMS overall 
(OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.09-1.29). Large size for gestational age also significantly 
increased the risk of embryonal RMS (OR=1.42, 95% CI=1.03-1.96).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a positive association between accelerated in 
utero growth and embryonal RMS, but not alveolar RMS. These results warrant 
cautious interpretation owing to the small number of alveolar RMS cases.
