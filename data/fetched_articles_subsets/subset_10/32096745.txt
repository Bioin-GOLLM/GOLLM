BACKGROUND: HIV-1 CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC recombinant strains are responsible for 
more than 80% of new infections in China since the beginning of the 2000s. These 
two strains may have distinct genetic mutations, which resulted in distinct 
patterns of pathogenesis related to the viral gene, Vpr.
OBJECTIVE: The amino acid pattern and genetic diversity of Vpr were analyzed and 
characterized in HIV-1 CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC HIV-1 strains.
METHODS: The Vpr gene was amplified from extracted viral RNA and DNA sequencing 
was performed using an ABI3730 analyzer. The positional amino acid composition, 
genetic variation and distance of Vpr sequence were analyzed by Bio-Edit 7.2 and 
Mega 6.01 software packages.
RESULTS: A total of 162 CRF01_AE and 80 CRF07_BC derived Vpr sequences were 
obtained by DNA sequencing. CRF01_AE patients showed higher viral load and lower 
CD4 counts than CRF07_BC patients (P<0.05). Higher genetic distance and more 
polymorphic amino acids were found in CRF01_AE Vpr than CRF07_BC Vpr (P<0.05). 
The common conservative amino acid region was identified as 29EAVRHFP35 in both 
CRF07_BC and CRF01_AE. Of note, the R77Q mutation was found in both the most 
recently Chinese derived CRF07_BC and CRF01_AE Vpr.
CONCLUSION: CRF01_AE derived Vpr has higher genetic variation and pathogenesis 
in comparison to the CRF07_BC strain.
