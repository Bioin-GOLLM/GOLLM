The study investigates the antitumor effect of two cationic peptides, 
R-DIM-P-LF11-215 (RDP215) and the D-amino acid variant 9D-R-DIM-P-LF11-215 
(9D-RDP215), targeting the negatively charged lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) 
exposed by cancer cells, such as of melanoma and glioblastoma. Model studies 
mimicking cancer and non-cancer membranes revealed the specificity for the 
cancer-mimic PS by both peptides with a slightly stronger impact by the 
D-peptide. Accordingly, membrane effects studied by DSC, leakage and quenching 
experiments were solely induced by the peptides when the cancer mimic PS was 
present. Circular dichroism revealed a sole increase in β-sheet conformation in 
the presence of the cancer mimic for both peptides; only 9D-RDP215 showed 
increased structure already in the buffer. Ex vitro stability studies by 
SDS-PAGE as well as in vitro with melanoma A375 revealed a stabilizing effect of 
D-amino acids in the presence of serum, which was also confirmed in 2D and 3D in 
vitro experiments on glioblastoma LN-229. 9D-RDP215 was additionally able to 
pass a BBB model, whereupon it induced significant levels of cell death in 
LN-229 spheroids. Summarized, the study encourages the introduction of D-amino 
acids in the design of antitumor peptides for the improvement of their stable 
antitumor activity.
