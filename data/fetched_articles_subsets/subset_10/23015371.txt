Neuroimaging has played an important role in the characterization of the 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes, demonstrating neurodegenerative 
signatures that can aid in the differentiation of FTD from other 
neurodegenerative disorders. Recent advances have been driven largely by the 
refinement of the clinical syndromes that underlie FTD, and by the discovery of 
new genetic and pathological features associated with FTD. Many new imaging 
techniques and modalities are also now available that allow the assessment of 
other aspects of brain structure and function, such as diffusion tensor imaging 
and resting-state functional MRI. Studies have used these recent techniques, as 
well as traditional volumetric MRI, to provide further insight into disease 
progression across the many clinical, genetic, and pathological variants of FTD. 
Importantly, neuroimaging signatures have been identified that will improve the 
clinician's ability to predict underlying genetic and pathological features, and 
hence ultimately improve patient diagnosis.
