Sepsis remains a major cause of death despite advances in medical care. 
Metabolic deregulation is an important component of the survival process. 
Metabolomic analysis allows profiling of critical metabolic functions with the 
potential to classify patient outcome. Our prospective longitudinal 
characterization of 33 septic and non-septic critically ill patients showed that 
deviations, independent of direction, in plasma levels of lipid metabolites were 
associated with sepsis mortality. We identified a coupling of metabolic 
signatures between liver and plasma of a rat sepsis model that allowed us to 
apply a human kinetic model of mitochondrial beta-oxidation to reveal differing 
enzyme concentrations for medium/short-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase 
(elevated in survivors) and crotonase (elevated in non-survivors). These data 
suggest a need to monitor cellular energy metabolism beyond the available 
biomarkers. A loss of metabolic adaptation appears to be reflected by an 
inability to maintain cellular (fatty acid) metabolism within a "corridor of 
safety".
