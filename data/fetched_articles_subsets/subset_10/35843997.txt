BACKGROUND: Larotrectinib is the first tumour-agnostic therapy that has been 
approved by the European Medicines Agency. Tumour-agnostic therapies are 
indicated for a multitude of tumour types. The economic models supporting 
reimbursement submissions of tumour-agnostic therapies are complex because of 
the multitude of indications per model.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
larotrectinib compared with standard of care in patients with cancer with 
tropomyosin receptor kinase fusion-positive tumour types in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A previously constructed cost-effectiveness model with a partitioned 
survival approach was adapted to the Dutch setting, simulating costs and effects 
of treatment in patients with tropomyosin receptor kinase fusion-positive 
cancer. The cost-effectiveness model conducts a naïve comparison of 
larotrectinib to a weighted comparator standard-of-care arm. Dutch specific 
resource use and costs were implemented and inflated to reflect 2019 euros. The 
analysis includes a lifetime horizon and a societal perspective.
RESULTS: Larotrectinib versus Dutch standard of care resulted in 5.61 
incremental (QALYs) and €232,260 incremental costs, leading to an incremental 
cost-effectivenes ratio of €41,424/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
reveals a 88% chance of larotrectinib being cost effective compared with the 
pooled comparator standard-of-care arm at the applicable €80,000/QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold in the Netherlands.
CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost-effectivenes ratio was well below the 
applicable threshold for diseases with a high burden of disease in the 
Netherlands (€80,000). At this threshold, larotrectinib was estimated to be a 
cost-effective treatment for patients with tropomyosin receptor kinase 
fusion-positive cancer compared with current standard of care in the 
Netherlands.
