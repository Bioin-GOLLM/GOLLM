Both malformations of the central nervous system and neurometabolic disorders 
are common, mainly in highly consanguineous populations. Both metabolic pathways 
and developmental pathways are closely related and interact with each other. 
Neurometabolic disorders can lead to disturbances in brain development through 
multiple mechanisms that include deficits in energy metabolism, critical 
nutrient deficiency, accumulation of neurotoxic substrates, abnormality in cell 
membrane constituents, and interference in cell-to-cell signaling pathways. The 
anomalies observed include absent or hypoplastic corpus callosum, midline brain 
defects, and malformations of the cortex, the cerebellum and the brain stem. 
Early diagnosis of an underlying inherited neurometabolic disorders is critical 
for the institution of treatment, which may positively influence prognosis, and 
allow for proper genetic counseling. In this review, we discuss those disorders 
in which the structural brain malformation is a dominant feature, and propose a 
practical approach that will permit a physician to investigate, and treat these 
disorders.
