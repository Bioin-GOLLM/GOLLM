Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) might not only be 
circumscribed to the motor system but also involves other neuronal systems 
including sensory abnormalities. In line with this notion, we aimed to assess 
the pathophysiology of sensory disturbances in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS, 
focusing on the satellite glial cells (SGCs) at the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) 
as a new potential target of the disease. Material and Methods: The presence of 
sensory disturbances was evaluated using von Frey, hot plate, and hot water tail 
immersion tests at 75 days old, which represented the motor-pre-symptomatic 
stage. Cell biology analysis was performed at 75 and 95 days old and included 
conventional histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy of sensory 
neuron-SGC unit dissociates as a well as western blotting from DRG lysates. 
Results: At 75 days old, von Frey and hot plate tests demonstrated clear 
thermoalgesic disturbances in ALS transgenic mice. Histological studies of the 
SN-SGC units revealed abnormal SOD1 accumulation, which was associated with 
nitro-oxidative stress and biogenesis of lipid droplets in SGCs. Interestingly, 
these alterations led to a progressive lysosomal storage disorder and 
occasionally vacuolar degeneration in SGCs. Conclusions: SGCs emerge as a 
primary pathophysiological target in the SOD1 transgenic murine model of ALS, 
clearly reinforcing the pathogenic role of glial cells in motor neuron disease. 
Presymptomatic alterations of SGCs, might not only be responsible of sensory 
disturbances in ALS, but due to spinal cord sensory-motor circuits could also 
contribute to anterior horn motor disturbances.
