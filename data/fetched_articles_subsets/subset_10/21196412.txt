Integrin-linked kinase 1 (ILK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays 
important roles in a variety of cellular functions including cell survival, 
migration and angiogenesis. ILK1 is normally expressed in numerous tissues and 
activated by growth factors, cytokines and hormones. Dysregulation of ILK1 
expression or function is found in several hormonal tumors including breast, 
ovary and prostate. Emerging evidence suggests that ILK overexpression promotes 
cellular transformation, cell survival, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), 
and metastasis of hormonal cancer cells while inhibition of ILK1 reduces tumor 
growth and progression. The recent development of ILK1 inhibitors has provided 
novel mechanisms for blocking ILK1 signaling to curb metastasis and therapy 
resistance of hormonal tumors. This review will focus on recent advances made 
towards understanding the role of ILK signaling axis in progression of hormonal 
cancer.
