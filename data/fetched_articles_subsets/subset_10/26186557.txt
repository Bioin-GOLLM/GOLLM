Germline mutations in genes coding for molecules involved in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK 
pathway are the hallmarks of a newly classified family of autosomal dominant 
syndromes termed RASopathies. Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), in 
particular, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, can lead to potentially severe 
complications in children with Noonan syndrome (NS). We studied 27 children with 
NS or other RASopathies and 35 age-matched children as control subjects. 
Peripheral blood (PB) cells from these patients were studied for in vitro 
colony-forming units (CFUs) activity, as well as for intracellular 
phosphosignaling. Higher spontaneous growth of both burst-forming 
units-erythroid (BFU-E) and CFU-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies from 
RAS-mutated patients were observed as compared with control subjects. We also 
observed a significantly higher amount of GM-colony-stimulating factor-induced 
p-ERK in children with RASopathies. Our findings demonstrate for the first time 
that PB cells isolated from children suffering from NS or other RASopathies 
without MPD display enhanced BFU-E and CFU-GM colony formation in vitro. The 
biological significance of these findings clearly awaits further studies. 
Collectively, our data provide a basis for further investigating of only 
partially characterized hematological alterations present in children suffering 
from RASopathies, and may provide new markers for progression toward malignant 
MPD in these patients.
