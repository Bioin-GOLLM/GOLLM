Proteins of the alkylation B (AlkB) superfamily show RNA demethylase activity 
removing methyl adducts from N6 -methyladenosine (m6 A). m6 A is a reversible 
epigenetic mark of RNA that regulates human virus replication but has unclear 
roles in plant virus infection. We focused on Potyvirus-the largest genus of 
plant RNA viruses-and report here the identification of AlkB domains within P1 
of endive necrotic mosaic virus (ENMV) and an additional virus of a putative 
novel species within Potyvirus. We show that Nicotiana benthamiana m6 A levels 
are reduced by infection of plum pox virus (PPV) and potato virus Y (PVY). The 
two potyviruses lack AlkB and the results suggest a general involvement of RNA 
methylation in potyvirus infection and evolution. Methylated RNA 
immunoprecipitation sequencing of virus-infected samples showed that m6 A peaks 
are enriched in plant transcript 3' untranslated regions and in discrete 
internal and 3' terminal regions of PPV and PVY genomes. Down-regulation of N. 
benthamiana AlkB homologues of the plant-specific ALKBH9 clade caused a 
significant decrease in PPV and PVY accumulation. In summary, our study provides 
evolutionary and experimental evidence that supports the m6 A implication and 
the proviral roles of AlkB homologues in Potyvirus infection.
