SYL3-k allele increases the outcrossing rate of male sterile line and the yield 
of hybrid F1 seeds via enhancement of endogenous GA4 content in Oryza sativa L. 
pistils. The change in style length might be an adaptation of rice cultivation 
from south to north in the northern hemisphere. The style length (SYL) in rice 
is one of the major factors influencing the stigma exertion, which affects the 
outcross rate of male sterile line and the yield of hybrid F1 seeds. However, 
the biological mechanisms underlying SYL elongation remain elusive. Here, we 
report a map-based cloning and characterisation of the allele qSYL3-k. The 
qSYL3-k allele encodes a MADS-box family transcription factor, and it is 
expressed in various rice organs. The qSYL3-k allele increases SYL via the 
elongation of cell length in the style, which is associated with a higher GA4 
content in the pistil. The expression level of OsGA3ox2 in pistils with qSYL3-k 
alleles is significantly higher than that in pistils with qSYL3-n allele on the 
same genome background of Nipponbare. The yield of F1 seeds harvested from 
plants with 7001SSYL3-k alleles was 16% higher than that from plants with 
7001SSYL3-n allele. The sequence data at the qSYL3 locus in 136 accessions 
showed that alleles containing the haplotypes qSYL3AA, qSYL3AG, and qSYL3GA 
increased SYL, whereas those containing the haplotype qSYL3GG decreased it. The 
frequency of the haplotype qSYL3GG increases gradually from the south to north 
in the northern hemisphere. These findings will facilitate improvement in SYL 
and yield of F1 seeds henceforward.
