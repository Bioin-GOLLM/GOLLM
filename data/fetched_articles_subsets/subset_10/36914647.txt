Inhibition of AMPK is tightly associated with metabolic perturbations upon over 
nutrition, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying are not clear. Here, we 
demonstrate the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 6 regulatory subunit 3, 
SAPS3, is a negative regulator of AMPK. SAPS3 is induced under high fat diet 
(HFD) and recruits the PP6 catalytic subunit to deactivate phosphorylated-AMPK, 
thereby inhibiting AMPK-controlled metabolic pathways. Either whole-body or 
liver-specific deletion of SAPS3 protects male mice against HFD-induced 
detrimental consequences and reverses HFD-induced metabolic and transcriptional 
alterations while loss of SAPS3 has no effects on mice under balanced diets. 
Furthermore, genetic inhibition of AMPK is sufficient to block the protective 
phenotype in SAPS3 knockout mice under HFD. Together, our results reveal that 
SAPS3 is a negative regulator of AMPK and suppression of SAPS3 functions as a 
guardian when metabolism is perturbed and represents a potential therapeutic 
strategy to treat metabolic syndromes.
