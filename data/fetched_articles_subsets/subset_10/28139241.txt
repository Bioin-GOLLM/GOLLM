OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, biochemical, and genetic features of 
patients with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) identified in Spain 
during the last 20 years.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients were selected among those presenting with multisystem 
disease of unknown etiology. The isoforms of transferrin and of ApoC3 and 
dolichols were analyzed in serum; phosphomannomutase and mannosephosphate 
isomerase activities were measured in fibroblasts. Conventional or massive 
parallel sequencing (customized panel or Illumina Clinical-Exome Sequencing 
TruSight One Gene Panel) was used to identify genes and mutations.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were diagnosed with 18 different CDG. Eighty-nine 
patients had a type 1 transferrin profile; 8 patients had a type 2 transferrin 
profile, with 6 of them showing an alteration in the ApoC3 isoform profile. A 
total of 75% of the patients had PMM2-CDG presenting with a heterogeneous 
mutational spectrum. The remaining patients showed mutations in any of the 
following genes: MPI, PGM1, GFPT1, SRD5A3, DOLK, DPGAT1, ALG1, ALG6, RFT1, SSR4, 
B4GALT1, DPM1, COG6, COG7, COG8, ATP6V0A2, and CCDC115.
CONCLUSION: Based on literature and on this population-based study of CDG, a 
comprehensive scheme including reported clinical signs of CDG is offered, which 
will hopefully reduce the timeframe from clinical suspicion to genetic 
confirmation. The different defects of CDG identified in Spain have contributed 
to expand the knowledge of CDG worldwide. A predominance of PMM2 deficiency was 
detected, with 5 novel PMM2 mutations being described.
