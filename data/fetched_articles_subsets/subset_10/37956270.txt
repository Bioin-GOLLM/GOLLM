Genetic studies in mice and human cancers established BCL11B as a 
haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene. Paradoxically, BCL11B is overexpressed 
in some human cancers where its knockdown is synthetic lethal. We identified the 
BCL11B protein in a proximity-dependent biotinylation screen performed with the 
DNA glycosylase NTHL1. In vitro DNA repair assays demonstrated that both BCL11B 
and a small recombinant BCL11B213-560 protein lacking transcription regulation 
potential can stimulate the enzymatic activities of two base excision repair 
(BER) enzymes: NTHL1 and Pol β. In cells, BCL11B is rapidly recruited to sites 
of DNA damage caused by laser microirradiation. BCL11B knockdown delays, whereas 
ectopic expression of BCL11B213-560 accelerates, the repair of oxidative DNA 
damage. Inactivation of one BCL11B allele in TK6 lymphoblastoid cells causes an 
increase in spontaneous and radiation-induced mutation rates. In turn, ectopic 
expression of BCL11B213-560 cooperates with the RAS oncogene in cell 
transformation by reducing DNA damage and cellular senescence. These findings 
indicate that BCL11B functions as a BER accessory factor, safeguarding normal 
cells from acquiring mutations. Paradoxically, it also enables the survival of 
cancer cells that would otherwise undergo senescence or apoptosis due to 
oxidative DNA damage resulting from the elevated production of reactive oxygen 
species.
