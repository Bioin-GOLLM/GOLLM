In 2008, SLC29A3 has been implicated in a syndromic form of genodermatosis: H 
syndrome. The major features encountered in H syndrome are Hearing loss, 
Hyperglycaemia, Heart anomalies, Hypertrichosis, Hyperpigmentation, Hepatomegaly 
and Hypogonadism. More recently, SLC29A3 mutations have been described in 
families presenting syndromes associating generalized histiocytosis to systemic 
progressive features: severe camptodactyly, hearing loss, hypogonadism, 
hepatomegaly, heart defects and skin hyperpigmentation. We have identified a 
homozygous missense SLC29A3 mutation in a patient presenting with only a 
progressive sensorineural hearing impairment and a single cervical node (Rosai 
Dorfman). SLC29A3 mutations appear to be involved in a large phenotypic 
continuum which should prompt physicians to study this gene even in mild 
clinical presentations.
