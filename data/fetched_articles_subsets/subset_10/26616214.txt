The genetic history of African populations is increasingly well documented, yet 
their patterns of epigenomic variation remain uncharacterized. Moreover, the 
relative impacts of DNA sequence variation and temporal changes in lifestyle and 
habitat on the human epigenome remain unknown. Here we generate genome-wide 
genotype and DNA methylation profiles for 362 rainforest hunter-gatherers and 
sedentary farmers. We find that the current habitat and historical lifestyle of 
a population have similarly critical impacts on the methylome, but the 
biological functions affected strongly differ. Specifically, methylation 
variation associated with recent changes in habitat mostly concerns immune and 
cellular functions, whereas that associated with historical lifestyle affects 
developmental processes. Furthermore, methylation variation--particularly that 
correlated with historical lifestyle--shows strong associations with nearby 
genetic variants that, moreover, are enriched in signals of natural selection. 
Our work provides new insight into the genetic and environmental factors 
affecting the epigenomic landscape of human populations over time.
