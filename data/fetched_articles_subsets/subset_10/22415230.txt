BACKGROUND: Laboratory studies suggest a possible role of magnesium intake in 
colorectal carcinogenesis but epidemiological evidence is inconclusive.
METHOD: We tested magnesium-colorectal cancer hypothesis in the Nurses' Health 
Study, in which 85â€‰924 women free of cancer in 1980 were followed until June 
2008. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate 
multivariable relative risks (MV RRs, 95% confidence intervals).
RESULTS: In the age-adjusted model, magnesium intake was significantly inversely 
associated with colorectal cancer risk; the RRs from lowest to highest decile of 
total magnesium intake were 1.0 (ref), 0.93, 0.81, 0.72, 0.74, 0.77, 0.72, 0.75, 
0.80, and 0.67 (P(trend)<0.001). However, in the MV model adjusted for known 
dietary and non-dietary risk factors for colorectal cancer, the association was 
significantly attenuated; the MV RRs were 1.0 (ref), 0.96, 0.85, 0.78, 0.82, 
0.86, 0.84, 0.91, 1.02, and 0.93 (P(trend)=0.77). Similarly, magnesium intakes 
were significantly inversely associated with concentrations of plasma C-peptide 
in age-adjusted model (P(trend)=0.002) but not in multivariate-adjusted model 
(P(trend)=0.61). Results did not differ by subsite or modified by calcium 
intakes or body mass index.
CONCLUSION: These prospective results do not support an independent association 
of magnesium intake with either colorectal cancer risk or plasma C-peptide 
levels in women.
