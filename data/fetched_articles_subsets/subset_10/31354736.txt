Sexual transmission of HIV-1 consists of processes that exert either positive or 
negative selection pressure on the virus. The sum of these selection pressures 
lead to the transmission of only one specific HIV-1 strain, termed the 
transmitted founder virus. Different dendritic cell subsets are abundantly 
present at mucosal sites and, interestingly, these DC subsets exert opposite 
pressure on viral selection during sexual transmission. In this review we 
describe receptors and cellular compartments in DCs that are involved in HIV-1 
communication leading to either viral restriction by the host or further 
dissemination to establish a long-lived reservoir. We discuss the current 
understanding of host antiretroviral restriction factors against HIV-1 and 
specifically against the HIV-1 transmitted founder virus. We will also discuss 
potential clinical implications for exploiting these intrinsic restriction 
factors in developing novel therapeutic targets. A better understanding of these 
processes might help in developing strategies against HIV-1 infections by 
targeting dendritic cells.
