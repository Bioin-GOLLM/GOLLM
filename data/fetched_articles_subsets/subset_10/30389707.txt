Management of the limited number of antimicrobials currently available requires 
the identification of infections that contain drug-resistant isolates and the 
discovery of factors that promote the evolution of drug resistance. Here, we 
report a single fungal infection in which we have identified numerous 
subpopulations that differ in their alleles of a single gene that impacts drug 
resistance. The diversity at this locus was markedly greater than the reported 
heterogeneity of alleles conferring antibiotic resistance in bacterial 
infections. Analysis of genomes from hundreds of Clavispora (Candida) lusitaniae 
isolates, through individual and pooled isolate sequencing, from a single 
individual with cystic fibrosis revealed at least 25 nonsynonymous mutations in 
MRR1, which encodes a transcription factor capable of inducing fluconazole (FLZ) 
resistance in Candida species. Isolates with high-activity Mrr1 variants were 
resistant to FLZ due to elevated expression of the MDR1-encoded efflux pump. We 
found that high Mrr1-regulated Mdr1 activity protected against host and 
bacterial factors, suggesting drug resistance can be selected for indirectly and 
perhaps explaining the Mrr1 heterogeneity in this individual who had no prior 
azole exposure. Regional analysis of C. lusitaniae populations from the upper 
and lower lobes of the right lung suggested intermingling of subpopulations 
throughout. Our retrospective characterization of sputum and lung populations by 
pooled sequencing found that alleles that confer FLZ resistance were a minority 
in each pool, possibly explaining why they were undetected before unsuccessful 
FLZ therapy. New susceptibility testing regimes may detect problematical 
drug-resistant subpopulations in heterogeneous single-species infections.
