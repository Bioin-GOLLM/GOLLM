Astrocytes have crucial functions in the central nervous system (CNS) and are 
major players in many CNS diseases. Research on astrocyte-centered diseases 
requires efficient and well-characterized gene transfer vectors. Vectors derived 
from the Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) target astrocytes in the 
brains of rodents and nonhuman primates. A recombinant (r) synthetic 
peptide-displaying AAV9 variant, rAAV9P1, that efficiently and selectively 
transduces cultured human astrocytes, has been described previously. Here, it is 
shown that rAAV9P1 retains astrocyte-targeting properties upon intravenous 
injection in mice. Detailed analysis of putative receptors on human astrocytes 
shows that rAAV9P1 utilizes integrin subunits αv, β8, and either β3 or β5 as 
well as the AAV receptor AAVR. This receptor pattern is distinct from that of 
vectors derived from wildtype AAV2 or AAV9. Furthermore, a CRISPR/Cas9 
genome-wide knockout screening revealed the involvement of several 
astrocyte-associated intracellular signaling pathways in the transduction of 
human astrocytes by rAAV9P1. This study delineates the unique receptor and 
intracellular pathway signatures utilized by rAAV9P1 for targeting human 
astrocytes. These results enhance the understanding of the transduction biology 
of synthetic rAAV vectors for astrocytes and can promote the development of 
advanced astrocyte-selective gene delivery vehicles for research and clinical 
applications.
