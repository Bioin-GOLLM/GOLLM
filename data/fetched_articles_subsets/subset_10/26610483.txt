DnaA oligomerizes when bound to origins of chromosomal replication. Structural 
analysis of a truncated form of DnaA from Aquifex aeolicus has provided insight 
into crucial conformational differences within the AAA+ domain that are specific 
to the ATP- versus ADP- bound form of DnaA. In this study molecular docking of 
ATP and ADP onto Escherichia coli DnaA, modeled on the crystal structure of 
Aquifex aeolicus DnaA, reveals changes in the orientation of amino acid residues 
within or near the vicinity of the nucleotide-binding pocket. Upon limited 
proteolysis with trypsin or chymotrypsin ADP-DnaA, but not ATP-DnaA generated 
relatively stable proteolytic fragments of various sizes. Examined sites of 
limited protease susceptibility that differ between ATP-DnaA and ADP-DnaA 
largely reside in the amino terminal half of DnaA. The concentration of adenine 
nucleotide needed to induce conformational changes, as detected by these 
protease susceptibilities of DnaA, coincides with the conversion of an inactive 
bacterial origin recognition complex (bORC) to a replication efficient 
pre-replication complex (pre-RC) at the E. coli chromosomal origin of 
replication (oriC).
