Evidence of the impact of nutrition on human brain development is compelling. 
Previous in vitro and in vivo results show that three specific amino acids, 
histidine, lysine, and threonine, synergistically inhibit mTOR activity and 
behavior. Therefore, the prenatal availability of these amino acids could be 
important for human neurodevelopment. However, methods to study the underlying 
mechanisms in a human model of neurodevelopment are limited. Here, we pioneer 
the use of human cerebral organoids to investigate the impact of amino acid 
supplementation on neurodevelopment. In this study, cerebral organoids were 
exposed to 10 mM and 50 mM of the amino acids threonine, histidine, and lysine. 
The impact was determined by measuring mTOR activity using Western blots, 
general cerebral organoid size, and gene expression by RNA sequencing. Exposure 
to threonine, histidine, and lysine led to decreased mTOR activity and markedly 
reduced organoid size, supporting findings in rodent studies. RNA sequencing 
identified comprehensive changes in gene expression, with enrichment in genes 
related to specific biological processes (among which are mTOR signaling and 
immune function) and to specific cell types, including proliferative precursor 
cells, microglia, and astrocytes. Altogether, cerebral organoids are responsive 
to nutritional exposure by increasing specific amino acid concentrations and 
reflect findings from previous rodent studies. Threonine, histidine, and lysine 
exposure impacts the early development of human cerebral organoids, illustrated 
by the inhibition of mTOR activity, reduced size, and altered gene expression.
