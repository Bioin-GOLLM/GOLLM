We studied the relationship between endothelial NO-synthase gene (NOS3) and G 
protein Î²3 subunit gene (GNB3) polymorphisms and reactivity of skin microvessels 
during physiological gestation. T-786C NOS3 polymorphism influenced the maximum 
blood flow rate in skin microvessels and the severity of postocclusive reactive 
hyperemia during the third trimester of pregnancy. The relationship between 
G894T NOS3 polymorphism and the duration of postocclusive reactive hyperemia was 
revealed. C825T GNB3 polymorphism affects the duration and severity of 
postocclusive reactive hyperemia during the first and third trimesters of 
pregnancy. Thus, NOS3 and GNB3 polymorphisms affect blood flow in the skin 
microvessels during physiological gestation.
