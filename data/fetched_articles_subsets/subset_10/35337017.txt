Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the wastewater-based epidemiology 
(WBE) of SARS-CoV-2 has been used as a complementary indicator to follow up on 
the trends in the COVID-19 spread in Belgium and in many other countries. To 
further develop the use of WBE, a multiplex digital polymerase chain reaction 
(dPCR) assay was optimized, validated and applied for the measurement of 
emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) in influent wastewater (IWW) 
samples. Key mutations were targeted in the different VOC strains, including 
SΔ69/70 deletion, N501Y, SΔ241 and SΔ157. The presented bioanalytical method was 
able to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 RNA originating from the wild-type and 
B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 variants. The dPCR assay proved to be sensitive 
enough to detect low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in IWW since the limit of 
detection of the different targets ranged between 0.3 and 2.9 copies/µL. This 
developed WBE approach was applied to IWW samples originating from different 
Belgian locations and was able to monitor spatio-temporal changes in the 
presence of targeted VOC strains in the investigated communities. The present 
dPCR assay developments were realized to bring added-value to the current 
national WBE of COVID-19 by also having the spatio-temporal proportions of the 
VoC in presence in the wastewaters.
