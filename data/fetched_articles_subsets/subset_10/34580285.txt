Here we describe three novel TCOF1 mutations found in unrelated patients with 
Treacher Collins syndrome. These mutations include one deletion, 
NM_001135243.2:c.2604_2605delAG (p.Gly869Glufs*3), and two substitutions, 
NM_001135243.2:c.2575C>T (p.Gln859*) and NM_001135243.2:c.4111G>T (p.Glu1371*). 
These mutations cause shortening of a protein called Treacle in patients with 
features typical of TCS. Continuous identification of new mutations is important 
to expand the mutation base, which is helpful in the diagnosis of both patients 
and their families.
