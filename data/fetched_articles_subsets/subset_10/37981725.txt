The Asian Thyroid Working Group was founded in 2017 at the 12th Asia Oceania 
Thyroid Association (AOTA) Congress in Busan, Korea. This group activity aims to 
characterize Asian thyroid nodule practice and establish strict diagnostic 
criteria for thyroid carcinomas, a reporting system for thyroid fine needle 
aspiration cytology without the aid of gene panel tests, and new clinical 
guidelines appropriate to conservative Asian thyroid nodule practice based on 
scientific evidence obtained from Asian patient cohorts. Asian thyroid nodule 
practice is usually designed for patient-centered clinical practice, which is 
based on the Hippocratic Oath, "First do not harm patients," and an oriental 
filial piety "Do not harm one's own body because it is a precious gift from 
parents," which is remote from defensive medical practice in the West where 
physicians, including pathologists, suffer from severe malpractice climate. 
Furthermore, Asian practice emphasizes the importance of resource management in 
navigating the overdiagnosis of low-risk thyroid carcinomas. This article 
summarizes the Asian Thyroid Working Group activities in the past 7 years, from 
2017 to 2023, highlighting the diversity of thyroid nodule practice between Asia 
and the West and the background reasons why Asian clinicians and pathologists 
modified Western systems significantly.
