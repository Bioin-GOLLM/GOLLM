Characterization of the transcriptional regulator Rv3124 of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis identifies it as a positive regulator of molybdopterin biosynthesis 
and defines the functional consequences of a non-synonymous SNP in the 
Mycobacterium bovis BCG orthologue.

A number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the 
genome of Mycobacterium bovis BCG Pasteur compared with the sequenced strain M. 
bovis 2122/97. The functional consequences of many of these mutations remain to 
be described; however, mutations in genes encoding regulators may be 
particularly relevant to global phenotypic changes such as loss of virulence, 
since alteration of a regulator's function will affect the expression of a wide 
range of genes. One such SNP falls in bcg3145, encoding a member of the 
AfsR/DnrI/SARP class of global transcriptional regulators, that replaces a 
highly conserved glutamic acid residue at position 159 (E159G) with glycine in a 
tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) located in the bacterial transcriptional 
activation (BTA) domain of BCG3145. TPR domains are associated with 
protein-protein interactions, and a conserved core (helices T1-T7) of the BTA 
domain seems to be required for proper function of SARP-family proteins. 
Structural modelling predicted that the E159G mutation perturbs the third 
alpha-helix of the BTA domain and could therefore have functional consequences. 
The E159G SNP was found to be present in all BCG strains, but absent from 
virulent M. bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. By overexpressing 
BCG3145 and Rv3124 in BCG and H37Rv and monitoring transcriptome changes using 
microarrays, we determined that BCG3145/Rv3124 acts as a positive 
transcriptional regulator of the molybdopterin biosynthesis moa1 locus, and we 
suggest that rv3124 be renamed moaR1. The SNP in bcg3145 was found to have a 
subtle effect on the activity of MoaR1, suggesting that this mutation is not a 
key event in the attenuation of BCG.
