Plant secondary metabolites include an array of bioactive constituents form both 
medicinal and food plants able to improve human health. The exposure to these 
phytochemicals, including phenylpropanoids, isoprenoids and alkaloids, through 
correct dietary habits, may promote health benefits, protecting against the 
chronic degenerative disorders mainly seen in Western industrialized countries, 
such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, 
we briefly deal with some plant foods and herbs of traditional medicines and 
diets, focusing on their neuroprotective active components. Because oxidative 
stress and neuroinflammation resulting from neuroglial activation, at the level 
of neurons, microglial cells and astrocytes, are key factors in the 
etiopathogenesis of both neurodegenerative and neurological diseases, emphasis 
will be placed on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity exerted by 
specific molecules present in food plants or in remedies prescribed by herbal 
medicines.
