Changes in social preference of amphibian larvae result from sustained exposure 
to kinship odorants. To understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this 
neuroplasticity, we investigated the effects of olfactory system activation on 
neurotransmitter (NT) expression in accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) interneurons 
during development. We show that protracted exposure to kin or non-kin 
odorants changes the number of dopamine (DA)- or gamma aminobutyric acid 
(GABA)-expressing neurons, with corresponding changes in attraction/aversion 
behavior. Changing the relative number of dopaminergic and GABAergic AOB 
interneurons or locally introducing DA or GABA receptor antagonists alters 
kinship preference. We then isolate AOB microRNAs (miRs) differentially 
regulated across these conditions. Inhibition of miR-375 and miR-200b reveals 
that they target Pax6 and Bcl11b to regulate the dopaminergic and GABAergic 
phenotypes. The results illuminate the role of NT switching governing 
experience-dependent social preference. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
