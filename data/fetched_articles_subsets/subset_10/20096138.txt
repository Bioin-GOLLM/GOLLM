BACKGROUND: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and depressive 
symptoms are common in later life. Observational evidence suggests that 
depression is more prevalent among people with high plasma homocysteine (tHcy), 
but the results of randomized trials to date have been unable to show that 
lowering tHcy through the supplementation of vitamins B6, B12 and folate 
benefits depressive symptoms. We designed the B-VITAGE trial to determine 
whether adjunctive treatment with vitamins B6, B12 and folate increases the 
efficacy of standard antidepressant treatment.
METHODS/DESIGN: The B-VITAGE trial is a 12-month randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial of daily citalopram (20 to 40 mg) plus B12(0.5 mg), B6 
(25 mg) and folic acid (2 mg) or citalopram (20 to 40 mg) plus placebo for the 
treatment of depression in later life. The trial aims to recruit over 300 older 
adults with major depression (DSM-IV) and has been powered to detect the impact 
of an intervention associated with moderate effect size. Depressive symptoms 
will be rated with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The 
trial has two main outcomes of interest: a reduction of 50% or more in the MADRS 
total score between baseline and week 12 and the remission of the depressive 
episode at weeks 12, 26 and 52 according to DSM-IV criteria. We hypothesize that 
subjects randomly allocated to the vitamin arm of the study will be more likely 
to show a clinically significant improvement and achieve and maintain remission 
of symptoms at 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes of interest include 
compliance with treatment, reduction in the severity of depressive symptoms, 
switching to different antidepressants, the use of non-pharmacological 
antidepressant treatments, response to treatment according to MTHFRC677T 
genotype, and changes in cognitive function over 52 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial will clarify whether the systematic use 
of B-vitamins improves the response of older adults to standard antidepressant 
treatment. We anticipate that our findings will have implications for clinical 
practice and health policy development.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered with the Australian Clinical Trials 
Registry, trial number (())ACTRN12609000256279.
