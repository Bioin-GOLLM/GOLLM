BACKGROUND: A defect in the anion exchanger 1 (AE1) of the basolateral membrane 
of type A intercalated cells in the renal collecting duct may result in a 
failure to maintain a cell-to-lumen H+ gradient, leading to distal renal tubular 
acidosis (dRTA). Thus, dRTA may occur in Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO), a 
common AE1 gene abnormality observed in Southeast Asia and Melanesia. Our study 
investigated whether or not this renal acidification defect exists in 
individuals with SAO.
METHODS: Short and three-day NH4Cl loading tests were performed in 20 
individuals with SAO and in two subjects, including their families, with both 
SAO and dRTA. Mutations of AE1 gene in individuals with SAO and members of the 
two families were also studied.
RESULTS: Renal acidification in the 20 individuals with SAO and in the parents 
of the two families was normal. However, the two clinically affected individuals 
with SAO and dRTA had compound heterozygosity of 27 bp deletion in exon 11 and 
missense mutation G701D resulting from a CGG-->CAG substitution in exon 17 of 
the AE1 gene. Red cells of the two subjects with dRTA and SAO and the family 
members with SAO showed an approximate 40% reduction in sulfate influx with 
normal 4,4'-di-isothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid sensitivity and pH 
dependence.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that compound heterozygosity of abnormal AE1 
genes causes autosomal recessive dRTA in SAO.
