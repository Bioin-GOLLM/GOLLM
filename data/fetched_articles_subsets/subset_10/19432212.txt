Mutational decreasing of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade genes function 
leads to a life span increase in a lot of model organisms. However the 
geroprotector effect of pharmacological inhibition of PI3K has not yet been 
studied. In this connection, we analyzed life span of D. melanogaster wild type 
laboratory strain Canton-S after treatment by LY-294002 (5 microM), that is a 
specific inhibitor of PI3K at preimaginal stages of development and imago. It is 
shown that imago feeding by LY-294002 results in lifespan increase. The median 
lifespan increases by 14% in males and by 14.3% in females, the maximal--by 
22.5% in males, and by 16.3% in females. The obtained results demonstrate that 
specific inhibition of P13K has a geroprotector effect on D. melanogaster imago.
