RATIONALE: Frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD) is a dominant X-linked rare disease 
caused by mutations of FLNA. The distinctive features of FMD include skeletal 
dysplasia, facial dysmorphism, extremities anomalies, deafness, cleft palate and 
eye anterior segment anomalies, yet none of the complications, such as 
acro-osteolysis, keratitis, xerosis or poikiloderma, have been reported in FMD.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 29-year-old mother and her 7-year-old daughter, both 
presented with congenital glaucoma, craniofacial dysmorphism, xerosis and 
poikiloderma, were admitted to our hospital in 2011. Additionally, the mother 
also suffered from acro-osteolysis, keratitis, camptodactyly of hands and 
metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) which turned out to be fatal 
5 years later. In 2017, keratitis and acro-osteolysis were noticed in the 
daughter as well. Radiography showed bowed long bones with thickening cortex, 
and distal phalangeal osteolysis.
DIAGNOSES: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted in 2016, resulting in 
71491 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 7616 indels shared by patients while 
the father was taken as control. A FLNA variant was classified likely 
pathogenic, supporting the diagnoses of FMD. In addition, though our patients' 
symptoms were highly consistent with xeroderma pigmentosum variant, a mild 
subtype of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) with merely accumulated UV-induced lesions 
like xerosis and poikiloderma limited to sun-exposure sites, higher risks of 
cutaneous neoplasms and absence of classical XP features, WGS didn't find 
supportive genetical evidence, but 2 HERC2 variants were assigned highest 
suspicion in both XP and SCC by bioinformatical analyses.
INTERVENTIONS: Anti-inflammatory treatment, sunscreens and moisturizers were 
administered.
OUTCOMES: The daughter's cutaneous lesions developed slowly during the 6-year 
follow-up, but the keratitis seriously weakened her sight.
LESSONS: To our knowledge, it's the first report of cases carrying FMD, 
keratitis, xerosis, poikiloderma and acro-osteolysis simultaneously, and 3 
likely pathogenic variants were identified. Whole genome/exon sequencing is 
recommended as a common test for patients with rare phenotypes.
