Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have allowed for the identification of 
cellular subtypes on the basis of quantification of the number of transcripts in 
each cell. However, cells might also differ in the spatial distribution of 
molecules, including RNAs. Here, we present DypFISH, an approach to 
quantitatively investigate the subcellular localization of RNA and protein. We 
introduce a range of analytical techniques to interrogate single-molecule RNA 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) data in combination with protein 
immunolabeling. DypFISH is suited to study patterns of clustering of molecules, 
the association of mRNA-protein subcellular localization with microtubule 
organizing center orientation, and interdependence of mRNA-protein spatial 
distributions. We showcase how our analytical tools can achieve biological 
insights by utilizing cell micropatterning to constrain cellular architecture, 
which leads to reduction in subcellular mRNA distribution variation, allowing 
for the characterization of their localization patterns. Furthermore, we show 
that our method can be applied to physiological systems such as skeletal muscle 
fibers.
