BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is an incurable hematological malignancy 
characterized by a heterogeneous genetic and epigenetic landscape. Although a 
number of genetic aberrations associated with myeloma pathogenesis, progression 
and prognosis have been well characterized, the role of many epigenetic 
aberrations in multiple myeloma remain elusive. G9a, a histone 
methyltransferase, has been found to promote disease progression, proliferation 
and metastasis via diverse mechanisms in several cancers. A role for G9a in 
multiple myeloma, however, has not been previously explored.
METHODS: Expression levels of G9a/EHMT2 of multiple myeloma cell lines and 
control cells Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were analyzed. 
Correlation of G9a expression and overall survival of multiple myeloma patients 
were analyzed using patient sample database. To further study the function of 
G9a in multiple myeloma, G9a depleted multiple myeloma cells were built by 
lentiviral transduction, of which proliferation, colony formation assays as well 
as tumorigenesis were measured. RNA-seq of G9a depleted multiple myeloma with 
controls were performed to explore the downstream mechanism of G9a regulation in 
multiple myeloma.
RESULTS: G9a is upregulated in a range of multiple myeloma cell lines. G9a 
expression portends poorer survival outcomes in a cohort of multiple myeloma 
patients. Depletion of G9a inhibited proliferation and tumorigenesis in multiple 
myeloma. RelB was significantly downregulated by G9a depletion or small molecule 
inhibition of G9a/GLP inhibitor UNC0642, inducing transcription of proapoptotic 
genes Bim and BMF. Rescuing RelB eliminated the inhibition in proliferation and 
tumorigenesis by G9a depletion.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated that G9a is upregulated in most 
multiple myeloma cell lines. Furthermore, G9a loss-of-function analysis provided 
evidence that G9a contributes to multiple myeloma cell survival and 
proliferation. This study found that G9a interacts with NF-κB pathway as a key 
regulator of RelB in multiple myeloma and regulates RelB-dependent multiple 
myeloma survival. G9a therefore is a promising therapeutic target for multiple 
myeloma.
