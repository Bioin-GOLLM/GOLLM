Dynamin is a master regulator of membrane fission in endocytosis. However, a 
function for dynamin immediately upon fusion has also been suspected from a 
variety of experiments that measured release of granule contents. The role of 
dynamin guanosine triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) activity in controlling fusion 
pore expansion and postfusion granule membrane topology was investigated using 
polarization optics and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy 
(pTIRFM) and amperometry. A dynamin-1 (Dyn1) mutant with increased GTPase 
activity resulted in transient deformations consistent with rapid fusion pore 
widening after exocytosis; a Dyn1 mutant with decreased activity slowed fusion 
pore widening by stabilizing postfusion granule membrane deformations. The 
experiments indicate that, in addition to its role in endocytosis, GTPase 
activity of dynamin regulates the rapidity of fusion pore expansion from tens of 
milliseconds to seconds after fusion. These findings expand the 
membrane-sculpting repertoire of dynamin to include the regulation of immediate 
postfusion events in exocytosis that control the rate of release of soluble 
granule contents.
