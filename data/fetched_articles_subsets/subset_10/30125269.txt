The neurovascular unit (NVU) regulates metabolic homeostasis as well as drug 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the central nervous system. Metabolic 
fluxes and conversions over the NVU rely on interactions between brain 
microvascular endothelium, perivascular pericytes, astrocytes and neurons, 
making it difficult to identify the contributions of each cell type. Here we 
model the human NVU using microfluidic organ chips, allowing analysis of the 
roles of individual cell types in NVU functions. Three coupled chips model 
influx across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the brain parenchymal compartment 
and efflux across the BBB. We used this linked system to mimic the effect of 
intravascular administration of the psychoactive drug methamphetamine and to 
identify previously unknown metabolic coupling between the BBB and neurons. 
Thus, the NVU system offers an in vitro approach for probing transport, 
efficacy, mechanism of action and toxicity of neuroactive drugs.
