RATIONALE: The ventricular conduction system (VCS) rapidly propagates electrical 
impulses through the working myocardium of the ventricles to coordinate chamber 
contraction. GWAS (Genome-wide association studies) have associated nucleotide 
polymorphisms, most are located within regulatory intergenic or intronic 
sequences, with variation in VCS function. Two highly correlated polymorphisms 
(r2>0.99) associated with VCS functional variation (rs13165478 and rs13185595) 
occur 5' to the gene encoding the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 
HAND1 (heart- and neural crest derivatives-expressed protein 1).
OBJECTIVE: Here, we test the hypothesis that these polymorphisms influence HAND1 
transcription thereby influencing VCS development and function.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We employed transgenic mouse models to identify an enhancer 
that is sufficient for left ventricle (LV) cis-regulatory activity. Two 
evolutionarily conserved GATA transcription factor cis-binding elements within 
this enhancer are bound by GATA4 and are necessary for cis-regulatory activity, 
as shown by in vitro DNA binding assays. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats)/Cas9-mediated deletion of this enhancer dramatically 
reduces Hand1 expression solely within the LV but does not phenocopy previously 
published mouse models of cardiac Hand1 loss-of-function. Electrophysiological 
and morphological analyses reveals that mice homozygous for this deleted 
enhancer display a morphologically abnormal VCS and a conduction system 
phenotype consistent with right bundle branch block. Using 1000 Genomes Project 
data, we identify 3 additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), located 
within the Hand1 LV enhancer, that compose a haplotype with rs13165478 and 
rs13185595. One of these SNPs, rs10054375, overlaps with a critical GATA 
cis-regulatory element within the Hand1 LV enhancer. This SNP, when tested in 
electrophoretic mobility shift assays, disrupts GATA4 DNA-binding. Modeling 2 of 
these SNPs in mice causes diminished Hand1 expression and mice present with 
abnormal VCS function.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings reveal that SNP rs10054375, which is 
located within a necessary and sufficient LV-specific Hand1 enhancer, exhibits 
reduces GATA DNA-binding in electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and this 
enhancer in total, is required for VCS development and function in mice and 
perhaps humans.
