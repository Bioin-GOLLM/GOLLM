Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common form of heart muscle disease in 
which genetic factors play a critical etiological role. In this regard, both 
rare disease-causing mutations and common disease-susceptible variants, in the 
Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) gene have been reported, highlighting the 
critical role of BAG3 in cardiomyocytes and in the development of dilated 
cardiomyopathy. The phenotypic effects of the BAG3 mutations help investigators 
understand the structure and function of the BAG3 gene. Indeed, we report herein 
that all of the known pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants affect at least 1 of 
3 protein functional domains, ie, the WW domain, the second IPV (Ile-Pro-Val) 
domain, or the BAG domain, whereas none of the missense nontruncating 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants affect the proline-rich repeat (PXXP) 
domain. A common variant, p.Cys151Arg, associated with reduced susceptibility to 
dilated cardiomyopathy demonstrated a significant difference in allele 
frequencies among diverse human populations, suggesting evolutionary selective 
pressure. As BAG3-related therapies for heart failure move from the laboratory 
to the clinic, the ability to provide precision medicine will depend in large 
part on having a thorough understanding of the potential effects of both common 
and uncommon genetic variants on these target proteins. The current review 
article provides a roadmap that investigators can utilize to determine the 
potential interactions between a patient's genotype, their phenotype, and their 
response to therapeutic interventions with both gene delivery and small 
molecules.
