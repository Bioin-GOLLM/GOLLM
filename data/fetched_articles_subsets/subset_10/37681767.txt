The current review evaluates how inflammasomes and immune checkpoints are 
regulated in pre-eclampsia (PE) associated with tuberculosis (TB) and Human 
Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV). Studies indicate that inflammasomes such as 
(NRLP3, NEK7, and AIM2) and immune checkpoints such as (CLT4, PD-1, TIM3, and 
LAG-3) are dysregulated in TB- and HIV-infected individuals, and also in 
pre-eclamptic pregnancies, which explains why pregnant women who are either 
infected with TB or HIV have an increased risk of developing PE. Evidence 
suggests that inhibition of inflammasomes and immune checkpoints may assist in 
the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention and 
management of PE in patients with or without TB and HIV infection.
