The aim of this study is to develop a rapid and effective method to screen for 
Saudi carriers of one of the most common propionic acidemia mutations 
(c.425G > A) and to study the functional impact of this mutation. Using 
allele-specific primers, we have developed a qPCR assay that clearly 
distinguishes heterozygotes from mutated and wild type homozygotes that overcome 
the dependence on labor-intensive gene sequencing. We show here that (i) qPCR 
rapid test has strong accuracy in detecting (c.425G > A) mutation in 
heterozygotes and homozygotes individuals and that the Ct-value cut-offs were 
estimated to be and 23.37 ± 0.04 (CV-6 %, 95 %CI-7.25) for homozygote, 
25.06 ± 0.02 (CV-3.5 %, 95 %CI-7.85) for heterozygote PCCA c.425G > A mutation 
and 29.55 ± 0.002 (CV-11 %, 95 %CI-1.41) for PCCA wild type; (ii) the incidence 
of PA heterozygotes/carriers in Saudi population is about 550/100,000; (iii) 
skin fibroblast assays show that homozygote c.425G > A mutation induced 
propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity abrogation, (iv) PA patients showed an 
increased level of propionyl carnitine C3 in blood and 3-hydroxy propionic acid 
and methyl citrate in urine. Conclusion: qPCR represent an effective strategy to 
assess for PCCA mutation carriers in the Saudi population and we believe that 
will help in preventing homozygosity in the population after been implemented in 
pre-marriage screening program.
