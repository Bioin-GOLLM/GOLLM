BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a complex syndrome characterized by cardiac 
contractile impairment with high mortality. Defective intracellular Ca2+ 
homeostasis is the central cause under this scenario and tightly links to 
ultrastructural rearrangements of sarcolemmal transverse tubules and the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR); however, the modulators of the SR architecture 
remain unknown. The SR has been thought to be a specialized endoplasmic 
reticulum membrane system. Receptor accessory proteins (REEPs)/DP1/Yop1p are 
responsible for shaping high-curvature endoplasmic reticulum tubules. This study 
aimed to determine the role of REEPs in SR membrane shaping and thus cardiac 
function.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified REEP5 (receptor accessory protein 5) as more 
highly expressed than other REEP members in adult rat ventricular myocardium, 
and it was downregulated in the failing hearts. Targeted inactivation of REEP5 
in rats specially deformed the cardiac SR membrane without affecting transverse 
tubules, and this was visualized by focused ion beam scanning electron 
microscopy-based 3-dimensional reconstruction. Accordingly, simultaneous 
recordings of depolarization-induced Ca2+ currents and Ca2+ transients in 
REEP5-null cardiomyocytes revealed normal L-type Ca2+ channel currents but a 
depressed SR Ca2+ release. Consequently, the excitation-contraction coupling 
gain of cardiomyocytes and consequent cardiac contractility were compromised. 
REEP5 deficiency did not alter the expression of major proteins involved in Ca2+ 
handling in the heart.
CONCLUSIONS: REEP5 modulates cardiac function by shaping the SR. REEP5 defect 
deforms the SR architecture to depress cardiac contractility. REEP5-dependent SR 
shaping might have potential as a therapeutic target for heart failure.
