Quantitative antithrombin deficiency constitutes an important risk factor for 
venous thromboembolism, stillbirth, and other complications of pregnancy. 
Studies suggest, however, that individuals heterozygous for missense mutations 
involving the heparin-binding site of antithrombin do not have a significantly 
increased thrombotic risk. Owing to the rarity of such mutations, it remains 
unclear whether any specific heparin-binding site defects might be associated 
with thrombotic potential. We report here the case of a pregnant woman with an 
exceptionally rare Type II heparin-binding site antithrombin variant. This case 
highlights the difficult issues that are associated with the management of Type 
II antithrombin deficiency during pregnancy.
