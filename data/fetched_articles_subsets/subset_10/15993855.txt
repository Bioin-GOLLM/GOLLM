BACKGROUND: The serotonin transporter is the molecular target of many 
antidepressants, and the gene (SLC6A4) encoding this protein has been associated 
with response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We sought to 
test further the hypothesis that SLC6A4 is associated with SSRI response by 
resequencing this gene in subjects with major depression.
METHODS: The sequence of all exons, parts of all introns, and the promoter 
region containing a polymorphic repeat polymorphism (HTTLPR) previously 
associated with SSRI response was determined for 96 subjects, and variants were 
tested for association to treatment response with fluoxetine.
RESULTS: We screened a total of 712 kilobases of sequence and found 27 SLC6A4 
variants, 21 of which were previously undescribed. Seventeen were seen on one 
chromosome each, including three of the five exonic variants. One polymorphism 
(rs25531), just upstream of the HTTLPR, showed evidence of an association with 
treatment response, and biochemical experiments showed this polymorphism altered 
binding of nuclear extracts to a consensus sequence for the activator protein 2 
transcription factor, which is believed to be a critical factor in regulating 
neural gene expression in mammals.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support an association between response to SSRIs and 
deoxyribonucleic acid variation at the serotonin transporter locus. We have also 
identified a potentially important functional variant that contributes to this 
association and a possible biologic mechanism that could mediate its effect.
