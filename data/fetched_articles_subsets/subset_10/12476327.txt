The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is the site of primary action for the 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Previous Western reports have 
demonstrated that the lallele of the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic-region 
(5-HTTLPR) polymorphism is associated with better SSRI antidepressive effects 
than the s allele, however, another study of a Korean population has produced a 
contrasting finding. The present study tested the hypothesis that the 5-HTTLPR 
genetic polymorphism is associated with SSRI antidepressant response by 
evaluating total and cluster depressive symptoms for 121 Chinese patients 
diagnosed with major depression. Analysis of the results reveals that patients 
with the l/l genotype had a significantly better response to SSRI (fluoxetine) 
when compared with s allele carriers, as evaluated on the basis of total (P = 
0.013), core (P = 0.011), and psychic-anxiety (P = 0.005) and somatic-anxiety (P 
= 0.002) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-score percentage change. Our findings 
confirm reports that the l allele is associated with better SSRI response.
