BACKGROUND: Stroke is a heterogeneous, multifactorial disease regulated by 
modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors like total cholesterol, 
triglycerides, high density lipid-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density 
lipid-cholesterol (LDL-C) and glucose and non-modifiable factors like age. 
Evaluation of these risk factors for ischemic stroke may contribute to more 
effective prevention.
METHODS: This meta-analysis investigated the data up to 2018 with respect to 
age, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipid-cholesterol (HDL-C), 
low density lipid-cholesterol (LDL-C) and glucose levels in the Ischemic stroke 
patients and controls. Data from each eligible study was extracted such as year 
of publication, first author name, ethnicity/country, number of ischemic stroke 
patients and healthy controls and studies were subjected to heterogeneity 
analysis.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors like 
total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C glucose, triglycerides levels and age were 
not having significantly associated with ischemic stroke (p>0.05). However 
meta-analysis of triglyceride yielded significant association ischemic stroke 
with overall 95% CI (-0.62- (-0.09) and P= 0.007 and glucose also showed 
significant association with ischemic stroke with 95% CI (-1.08- (-0.14), 
P=0.01. Studies were subjected to heterogeneity which revealed significant 
heterogeneity with (P<0.00) and I2>96%.
CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis revealed that levels of triglyceride and glucose are 
the predisposing factors for ischemic stroke in the Asian population.
