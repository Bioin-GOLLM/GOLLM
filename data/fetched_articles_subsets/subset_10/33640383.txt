An improved understanding of stem cell niches, organogenesis, and disease models 
has paved the way for developing a three-dimensional (3D) organoid culture 
system. Organoid cultures can be derived from primary tissues (single cells or 
tissue subunits), adult stem cells (ASCs), induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSCs), or embryonic stem cells (ESCs). As a significant technological 
breakthrough, 3D organoid models offer a promising approach for understanding 
the complexities of human diseases ranging from the mechanistic investigation of 
disease pathogenesis to therapy. Here, we discuss the recent applications, 
advantages, and limitations of organoids as in vitro models for studying 
metabolomics, drug development, infectious diseases, and the gut microbiome. We 
further discuss the use of organoids in cancer modeling using high throughput 
sequencing approaches.
