Mutations within Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) cause amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), accounting for approximately 20% of familial cases. The 
pathological feature is a loss of motor neurons with enhanced formation of 
intracellular misfolded SOD1. Homozygous SOD1-D90A in familial ALS has been 
reported to show slow disease progression. Here, we reported a rare case of a 
slowly progressive ALS patient harboring a novel SOD1 homozygous mutation D92G 
(homD92G). The neuronal cell line overexpressing SOD1-D92G showed a lower ratio 
of the insoluble/soluble fraction of SOD1 with fine aggregates of the misfolded 
SOD1 and lower cellular toxicity than those overexpressing SOD1-G93A, a mutation 
that generally causes rapid disease progression. Next, we analyzed spinal motor 
neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) of a healthy control 
subject and ALS patients carrying SOD1-homD92G or heterozygous SOD1-L144FVX 
mutation. Lower levels of misfolded SOD1 and cell loss were observed in the 
motor neurons differentiated from patient-derived iPSCs carrying SOD1-homD92G 
than in those carrying SOD1-L144FVX. Taken together, SOD1-homD92G has a lower 
propensity to aggregate and induce cellular toxicity than SOD1-G93A or 
SOD1-L144FVX, and these cellular phenotypes could be associated with the 
clinical course of slowly progressive ALS.
