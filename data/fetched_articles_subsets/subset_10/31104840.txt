Ebola virus (EBOV) remains a public health threat. We performed a longitudinal 
study of B cell responses to EBOV in four survivors of the 2014 West African 
outbreak. Infection induced lasting EBOV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
antibodies, but their subclass composition changed over time, with IgG1 
persisting, IgG3 rapidly declining, and IgG4 appearing late. Striking changes 
occurred in the immunoglobulin repertoire, with massive recruitment of naive B 
cells that subsequently underwent hypermutation. We characterized a large panel 
of EBOV glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Only a small subset 
of mAbs that bound glycoprotein by ELISA recognized cell-surface glycoprotein. 
However, this subset contained all neutralizing mAbs. Several mAbs protected 
against EBOV disease in animals, including one mAb that targeted an epitope 
under evolutionary selection during the 2014 outbreak. Convergent antibody 
evolution was seen across multiple donors, particularly among VH3-13 
neutralizing antibodies specific for the GP1 core. Our study provides a 
benchmark for assessing EBOV vaccine-induced immunity.
