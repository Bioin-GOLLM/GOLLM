BACKGROUND: Skin signs observed in morbid obesity may change as the weight 
reduces, especially post-bariatric surgery (BaS). Data concerning the skin 
findings exclusively in post-BaS patients remain limited.
METHODS: Seventy post-BaS patients were examined for cutaneous abnormalities. 
The patients were divided into those with successful weight loss (% excessive 
body weight loss (EBWL) of at least 50%) and a non-successful group (%EBWL 
< 50%).
RESULTS: Forty-six patients with successful weight loss demonstrated a 
significantly lower prevalence of acanthosis nigricans on the neck, axillae and 
inguinal areas, keratosis pilaris (KP) and pebble fingers. However, a higher 
prevalence of alopecia was observed. After adjustment with patients' factors, KP 
(adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.21, 95%CI 0.06-0.74, p = 0.02) and pebble fingers 
(aOR = 0.09, 95%CI 0.01-0.89, p = 0.04) remained significantly less likely in 
patients with successful weight loss. Laboratory results comparing pre- and 
post-surgery values revealed significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose, 
hemoglobin A1c, and triglyceride and an increase of high-density lipoproteins in 
both groups. However, significant decreases of liver aminotransferases (AST and 
ALT) were observed only in the successful group (p = 0.04, 0.003). Nonetheless, 
a decrease in vitamin B12 (p = 0.01) was observed in the successful group.
CONCLUSION: Weight loss after BaS provided an improvement for metabolic 
profiles. Successful weight reduction resulted in better skin improvement. 
However, nutritional supplements may be necessary.
