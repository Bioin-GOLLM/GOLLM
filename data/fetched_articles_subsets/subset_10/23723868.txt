The title compound, C19H20O6, consists of a tetra-substituted benzene ring with 
one substituent being an α,β-unsaturated cinnamoyl group, which forms an 
extended conjugated system in the mol-ecule. In addition, two meth-oxy-meth-oxy 
and one hy-droxy group are bonded to the central benzene ring. The dihedral 
angle between eh rings is 10.22 (10)°. An intra-molecular hydrogen bond is 
observed between the hy-droxy group and the carbonyl O atom. One of the 
meth-oxy-meth-oxy substituents is conformationally disordered over two sets of 
sites with site-occupation factors of 0.831 (3) and 0.169 (3).
