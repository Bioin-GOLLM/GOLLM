BACKGROUND: In the advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a tumor 
thrombus (TT) can form in the portal or hepatic vein. The management of patients 
with advanced HCC and a TT extending into the right atrium (RA) and inferior 
vena cava (IVC) is extremely difficult and risky.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a patient with HCC and a large TT 
(85 × 45 mm) extending into the RA through the hepatic vein and IVC, which is 
very rare. We performed percutaneous microwave ablation of the TT and the two 
intrahepatic tumors (maximum diameter, 57 mm). The treatment shrank the tumors, 
and the patient is in good condition and has survived for 16 months thus far. A 
literature review was also performed. This is the first such case to be treated 
with percutaneous microwave ablation.
CONCLUSION: The outcomes in this case suggest that percutaneous ablation is 
useful for the treatment of TT extending into the RA and IVC in patients with 
HCC.
