Several population-specific genetic, sociodemographic, and maternal lifestyle 
factors are related to iron status in early pregnancy, and their identification 
would allow preventive actions to be taken. The study aimed to identify maternal 
factors associated with iron deficiency (ID) in early pregnancy in non-anaemic 
pregnant women from a European Mediterranean country. Cross-sectional study 
using the initial population of the ECLIPSES study performed in non-anaemic 
pregnant women before gestational week 12. Serum ferritin (SF) and haemoglobin 
concentrations were measured to evaluate iron status, and ID was defined as 
SF < 15 µg/L. Several sociodemographic and lifestyle data were recorded and used 
as covariates in the multivariate-adjusted regression models. Out of the 791 
participants, 13.9% had ID in early pregnancy. Underweight (OR 3.70, 95%CI 1.22, 
15.53) and parity (1 child: OR 2.03, 95%CI 1.06, 3.88; ≥ 2 children: OR 6.96, 
95%CI 3.09, 15.69) increased the odds of ID, while a high intake of total meat 
(≥ 108.57 g/day: OR 0.37, 95%CI 0.15, 0.87), red/processed meat (≥ 74.29 g/day: 
OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.35, 0.98), protein (≥ 65.05 g/day: OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.30, 0.99), 
and dietary iron (≥ 8.58 mg/day: OR 0.58, 95%CI 0.35, 0.94) protected against 
it. Smoking was also associated with a reduction in ID odds (OR 0.34, 95%CI 
0.12, 0.99). Baseline BMI, parity, smoking, and diet are associated with ID in 
early pregnancy in non-anaemic women. Pregnancy planning policies should focus 
on women at higher risk of ID, such as those who are underweight, multiparous, 
or following vegetarian diets. This clinical trial was registered at 
www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu as EudraCT number 2012-005,480-28 and at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov with identification number NCT03196882.
