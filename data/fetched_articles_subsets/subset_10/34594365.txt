MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes play vital roles in crops. However, 
the genetic variations in miRNA-targeted sites that affect miRNA cleavage 
efficiency and their correlations with agronomic traits in crops remain 
unexplored. On the basis of a genome-wide DNA re-sequencing of 210 elite 
rapeseed (Brassica napus) accessions, we identified the single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) in miRNA-targeted sites 
complementary to miRNAs. Variant calling revealed 7.14 million SNPs and 2.89 
million INDELs throughout the genomes of 210 rapeseed accessions. Furthermore, 
we detected 330 SNPs and 79 INDELs in 357 miRNA target sites, of which 33.50% 
were rare variants. We also analyzed the correlation between the genetic 
variations in miRNA target sites and 12 rapeseed agronomic traits. Eleven SNPs 
in miRNA target sites were significantly correlated with phenotypes in three 
consecutive years. More specifically, three correlated SNPs within the 
miRNA-binding regions of BnSPL9-3, BnSPL13-2, and BnCUC1-2 were in the loci 
associated with the branch angle, seed weight, and silique number, respectively; 
expression profiling suggested that the variation at these 3 miRNA target sites 
significantly affected the expression level of the corresponding target genes. 
Taken together, the results of this study provide researchers and breeders with 
a global view of the genetic variations in miRNA-targeted sites in rapeseed and 
reveal the potential effects of these genetic variations on elite agronomic 
traits.
