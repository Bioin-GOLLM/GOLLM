Orai1 and STIM1 are critical components of Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) 
(CRAC) channels that mediate store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) in immune cells. 
Although it is known that Orai1 and STIM1 co-cluster and physically interact to 
mediate SOCE, the cytoplasmic machinery modulating these functions remains 
poorly understood. We sought to find modulators of Orai1 and STIM1 using 
affinity protein purification and identified a novel EF-hand protein, CRACR2A 
(also called CRAC regulator 2A, EFCAB4B or FLJ33805). We show that CRACR2A 
interacts directly with Orai1 and STIM1, forming a ternary complex that 
dissociates at elevated Ca(2+) concentrations. Studies using knockdown mediated 
by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and mutagenesis show that CRACR2A is important 
for clustering of Orai1 and STIM1 upon store depletion. Expression of an EF-hand 
mutant of CRACR2A enhanced STIM1 clustering, elevated cytoplasmic Ca(2+) and 
induced cell death, suggesting its active interaction with CRAC channels. These 
observations implicate CRACR2A, a novel Ca(2+) binding protein that is highly 
expressed in T cells and conserved in vertebrates, as a key regulator of CRAC 
channel-mediated SOCE.
