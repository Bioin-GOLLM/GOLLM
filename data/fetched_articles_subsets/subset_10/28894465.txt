It is assumed that approximately 24-66% of patients with liver cirrhosis develop 
malnutrition. Numerous pathological processes lead to serious disorders of 
nutritional status in this group of patients. Malnutrition in the course of 
liver cirrhosis is associated with increased morbidity, complications, and low 
quality of life. Under these conditions, detection of malnutrition is of crucial 
importance. This review explores the complex mechanisms that lead to 
malnutrition in the course of liver cirrhosis and focuses on methods used in the 
assessment of nutritional status in cirrhotic patients. Among others, the role 
of bioelectrical impedance is highlighted. This noninvasive tool is promising 
and quite an accurate method of estimating body composition.
