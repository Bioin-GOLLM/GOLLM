Vacuolar protein sorting 41 (VPS41) is as part of the Homotypic fusion and 
Protein Sorting (HOPS) complex required for lysosomal fusion events and, 
independent of HOPS, for regulated secretion. Here, we report three patients 
with compound heterozygous mutations in VPS41 (VPS41S285P and VPS41R662* ; 
VPS41c.1423-2A>G and VPS41R662* ) displaying neurodegeneration with ataxia and 
dystonia. Cellular consequences were investigated in patient fibroblasts and 
VPS41-depleted HeLa cells. All mutants prevented formation of a functional HOPS 
complex, causing delayed lysosomal delivery of endocytic and autophagic cargo. 
By contrast, VPS41S285P enabled regulated secretion. Strikingly, loss of VPS41 
function caused a cytosolic redistribution of mTORC1, continuous nuclear 
localization of Transcription Factor E3 (TFE3), enhanced levels of LC3II, and a 
reduced autophagic response to nutrient starvation. Phosphorylation of mTORC1 
substrates S6K1 and 4EBP1 was not affected. In a C. elegans model of Parkinson's 
disease, co-expression of VPS41S285P /VPS41R662* abolished the neuroprotective 
function of VPS41 against α-synuclein aggregates. We conclude that the VPS41 
variants specifically abrogate HOPS function, which interferes with the 
TFEB/TFE3 axis of mTORC1 signaling, and cause a neurodegenerative disease.
