The Arabidopsis AAA ATPase SKD1 is essential for ESCRT-dependent endosomal 
sorting by mediating the disassembly of the ESCRTIII complex in an ATP-dependent 
manner. In this study, we show that SKD1 localizes to messenger 
ribonucleoprotein complexes upon heat stress. Consistent with this, the 
interactome of SKD1 revealed differential interactions under normal and stress 
conditions and included membrane transport proteins as well as proteins 
associated with RNA metabolism. Localization studies with selected interactome 
proteins revealed that not only RNA associated proteins but also several 
ESCRTIII and membrane trafficking proteins were recruited to messenger 
ribonucleoprotein granules after heat stress.
