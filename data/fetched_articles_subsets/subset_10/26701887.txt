Chromatin disorganization is one of the major alterations linked to prelamin A 
processing impairment. In this study we demonstrate that BAF is necessary to 
modulate prelamin A effects on chromatin structure. We show that when prelamin A 
and BAF cannot properly interact no prelamin A-dependent effects on chromatin 
occur; similar to what is observed in human Nestor Guillermo Progeria Syndrome 
cells harboring a BAF mutation, in HEK293 cells expressing a BAF mutant unable 
to bind prelamin A, or in siRNA mediated BAF-depleted HEK293 cells expressing 
prelamin A. BAF is necessary to induce histone trimethyl-H3K9 as well as 
HP1-alpha and LAP2-alpha nuclear relocalization in response to prelamin A 
accumulation. These findings are enforced by electron microscopy evaluations 
showing how the prelamin A-BAF interaction governs overall chromatin 
organization. Finally, we demonstrate that the LAP2-alpha nuclear localization 
defect observed in HGPS cells involves the progerin-BAF interaction, thus 
establishing a functional link between BAF and prelamin A pathological forms.
