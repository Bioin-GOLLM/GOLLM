BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and prognostic stratification of cardiac 
transthyretin amyloidosis are crucial. Although 99mTc 
3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanedicarboxylic acid (DPD) scintigraphy is the preferred 
method for the non-invasive diagnosis, its accuracy appears to be limited in 
transthyretin amyloidosis protein (ATTR) V30M mutation. Furthermore, its 
prognostic value in this mutation is unknown. This study investigated the 
diagnostic value of DPD scintigraphy to detect ATTR cardiomyopathy in V30M 
mutation and explored its prognostic value regarding mortality.
METHODS: A total of 288 ATTR V30M mutation carriers (median age: 46 years; 49% 
males) without myocardial thickening (defined as septal thickness ≥13mm) 
attributable to other causes and who underwent DPD scintigraphy were enrolled. 
ATTR cardiomyopathy was defined by septal thickness ≥13mm and at least one of 
the criteria: late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine 
(MIBG) uptake ratio <1.60; electrical heart disease or biopsy-documented 
amyloidosis.
RESULTS: ATTR cardiomyopathy was identified in 41 (14.2%) patients and cardiac 
DPD uptake in 34 (11.8%). During a mean follow-up of 33.6 ± 1.2 months, 16 
patients died (5.6%). Mortality was 14 times higher in patients with ATTR 
cardiomyopathy, 13 times higher in those with DPD uptake and 10 times higher in 
those with late H/M MIBG <1.60. The combined assessment of septal thickness and 
cardiac DPD uptake improved risk stratification: patients without septal 
thickening and without DPD retention had an excellent prognosis while those who 
presented either or both of them had a significantly worse prognosis, with 
5-year mortality rates ranging from 39.9 to 53.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: DPD scintigraphy is useful for prognostic stratification of ATTR 
V30M mutation carriers. Patients without septal thickening and no DPD uptake 
present the best prognosis compared to those with any signs of cardiac 
involvement.
