BACKGROUND: Gain-of-function mutations in the SCN9A gene (encoding to NaV1.7 
voltage-gated sodium channel) cause two rare paroxysmal pain disorders: 
inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEDP). 
These phenotypes are characterized by episodic extreme localized pain with 
cutaneous autonomic signs. So far, no other phenotypes have been associated with 
mutation in the SCN9A gene.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate mutations in the SCN9A gene in patients with chronic 
non-paroxysmal neuropathic pain.
PATIENTS: 9 patients with chronic severe unexplained neuropathic pain.
RESULTS: Of the nine patients one had predicted pathologic mutations in the 
SCN9A gene. This patient had a heterozygous change of n.4648 T-C in exon 27 
resulting in a substitution of W1550R, a highly conserved amino acid, predicting 
damage in the transmembrane S2 region, repeat IV. This mutation was not found in 
50 controls.
CONCLUSIONS: SCN9A mutations cause pain syndromes other than IEM and PEPD. These 
mutations should be considered in patients with resistant unexplained chronic 
neuropathic pain.
