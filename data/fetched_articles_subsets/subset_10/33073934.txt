BACKGROUND: Tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome (TRPS) is a rare autosomal dominant 
disorder characterized by craniofacial and skeletal malformations including 
short stature, thin scalp hair, sparse lateral eyebrows, a pear-shaped nose, and 
cone-shaped epiphyses. This condition is caused by haploinsufficiency or 
dominant-negative effect of the TRPS1 gene.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the clinical and genetic data of five 
unrelated TRPS patients. They were suspected of having TRPS on the basis of 
clinical and radiological features including typical hair and facial features, 
as well as varying degrees of skeletal abnormalities. Next-generation sequencing 
was performed to identify variants of the TRPS1 gene in the five patients.
RESULTS: In patient 1, we found a novel mutation at c.1338C>A (p.Tyr446*) (de 
novo). Patient 2 had a novel phenotype of hydrocephaly and Arnold-Chiari 
syndrome and we also found a maternally inherited novel mutation at c.2657C>A 
(p.Ser886*). Patient 3 had a de novo novel mutation at c.2726G>C (p.Cys909Ser) 
leading to more severe phenotypes. Patient 4 had a paternally inherited known 
mutation at c.2762G>A (p.Arg921Gln). Patient 5 with a novel phenotype of 
hepatopathy had a novel deletion at [GRCh37] del(8)(q23.3-q24.11) 
chr8:g.116,420,724-119,124,058 (over 2,700 kb). In addition, the patient 3 who 
harboring missense variants in the GATA binding domain of TRPS1 showed more 
severe craniofacial and skeletal phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe four novel mutations and two novel phenotypes in five 
patients. The mutational and phenotypic spectrum of TRPS is broadened by our 
study on TRPS mutations. Our results reveal the significance of molecular 
analysis of TRPS1 for improving the clinical diagnosis of TRPS.
