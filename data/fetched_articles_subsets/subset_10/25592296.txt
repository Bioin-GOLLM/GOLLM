Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple 
sclerosis (MS), results from an autoimmune attack of the central nervous system 
(CNS) by effector T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells. Regulatory T cells (Treg) can 
control effector T cells and limit the progression of CNS autoimmunity. Integrin 
alpha 4 (Itga4) is critical for the entry of Th1 but not Th17 cells into the CNS 
during EAE. Whether Itga4 controls the homing of Tregs in the CNS and whether 
Tregs can limit Th17-mediated EAE has, however, not been addressed. Through 
selective elimination of Itga4 in Foxp3-expressing cells, we show here that 
Tregs can suppress Th17-mediated EAE and enter into the CNS independently of 
Itga4. Furthermore, similarly to Th17 cells and in contrast to Th1 cells, Tregs 
depend on LFA-1 for their entry into the CNS in the absence of Itga4. Therefore, 
these data suggest that the efficacy of Itga4 neutralization on MS progression 
may be associated with the prevention of Th1 cells and the maintenance of Tregs 
migration into the CNS.
