Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that 
belongs to the Coronoviridae family, emerged in December 2019, causing the 
COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Unlike previous SARS and Middle East 
respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, this virus has a higher transmissibility 
rate, albeit a lower case fatality rate, which results in accumulation of a 
significant number of mutations and a faster evolution rate. Genomic studies on 
the mutation rate of the virus, as well as the identification of mutations that 
prevail and their impact on disease severity, are of great importance for 
pandemic surveillance and vaccine and drug development. Here, we aim to identify 
mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome and their effect on the proteins they 
are located in, in Greek patients infected in the first wave of the pandemic. To 
this end, we perform SARS-CoV-2 amplicon-based NGS sequencing on nasopharyngeal 
swab samples from Greek patients and bioinformatic analysis of the results. 
Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered genetically stable, we discover a variety of 
mutations on the viral genome. In detail, 18 mutations are detected in total on 
10 SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The mutations are located on ORF1ab, S protein, M 
protein, ORF3a and ORF7a. Sixteen are also detected in patients from other 
regions around the world, and two are identified for the first time in the 
present study. Most of them result in amino acid substitutions. These 
substitutions are analyzed using computational tools, and the results indicate 
minor or major impact on the proteins' structural stability, which could 
probably affect viral transmissibility and pathogenesis. The correlation of 
these variations with the viral load levels is examined, and their implication 
for disease severity and the biology of the virus are discussed.
