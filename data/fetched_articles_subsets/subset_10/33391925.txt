OBJECTIVES: The heterogenous clinical course in B-cell chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (B-CLL) can be linked to several genetic and phenotypic characteristics 
of malignant B-cells. Prognostic analysis in B-CLL is routinely carried out to 
assist patient management; particularly to predict the time to initiate 
treatment. Increased ZAP-70 expression is a surrogate marker for unmutated 
immunoglobulin genes and inferior clinical outcomes which can be quantified to 
predict future outcomes in B-CLL patients. The study determined the ZAP-70 
expression pattern using Z-index in Pakistani patients with B-CLL.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of B-CLL cases diagnosed and confirmed on flow 
cytometry at Aga Khan University Hospital for the last six years which had also 
undergone ZAP-70 analysis were included. In all these cases, ZAP-70 expression 
was quantified by measuring mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of normal 
B-cells, T-cells, and CLL-cells (CD19 and CD5 double-positive population). 
ZAP-70 expression was divided into high, low, and negative categories based on 
Z-index calculation. Mann-Whitney U test was utilized to determine the 
significance of ZAP-70 variations in different age groups and genders. P-value 
<0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: A total of 120 patients of B-CLL had ZAP-70 analysis during the study 
period. The median age was 62 with an interquartile range of 35-87 and male to 
female ratio of 2:1. ZAP-70 expression was high in 18 (15%), low in 52 (43.3%) 
and negative in 50 (41.7%) cases. No significant difference in ZAP-70 expression 
with respect to the age or gender of the study population was identified using 
appropriate statistical calculations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed only 15% of B-CLL cases showing high ZAP-70 
expression, a surrogate biomarker for possible aggressive behavior which may 
necessitate therapeutic intervention and close surveillance.
