Acquired T-cell dysfunction is common in chronic B-cell malignancies. Given the 
strong connection between T-cell metabolism and function, we investigated 
metabolic alterations as the basis of T-cell dysfunction induced by malignant 
cells. Using B-cell malignant cell lines and human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells, we first established a model that recapitulates major aspects of 
cancer-induced T-cell dysfunction. Cell lines derived from chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL) (PGA-1, CII, and Mec-1), but not from other B-cell malignancies, 
altered the T-cell metabolome by generating a pseudohypoxic state. T cells were 
retained in aerobic glycolysis and were not able to switch to oxidative 
phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Moreover, T cells produced immunosuppressive adenosine 
that negatively affected function by dampening the activation, which could be 
restored by the blocking of adenosine receptors. Subsequently, we uncovered a 
similar hypoxic-like signature in autologous T cells from primary CLL samples. 
Pseudohypoxia was reversible upon depletion of CLL cells ex vivo and, 
importantly, after the in vivo reduction of the leukemic burden with combination 
therapy (venetoclax and obinutuzumab), restoring T-cell function. In conclusion, 
we uncovered a pseudohypoxic program connected with T-cell dysfunction in CLL. 
Modulation of hypoxia and the purinergic pathway might contribute to therapeutic 
restoration of T-cell function.
