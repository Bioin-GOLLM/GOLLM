The ability to respond to genotoxic stress is a prerequisite for the successful 
development of the nervous system. Mutations in various DNA repair factors can 
lead to human diseases that are characterized by pronounced neuropathology. In 
many of these syndromes the neurological component is among the most deleterious 
aspects of the disease. The nervous system poses a particular challenge in terms 
of clinical intervention, as the neuropathology associated with these diseases 
often arises during nervous system development and can be fully penetrant by 
childhood. Understanding how DNA repair deficiency affects the nervous system 
will provide a rational basis for therapies targeted at ameliorating the 
neurological problems in these syndromes.
