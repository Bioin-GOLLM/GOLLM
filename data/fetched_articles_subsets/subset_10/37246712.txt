Ribosome profiling provides quantitative, comprehensive, and high-resolution 
snapshots of cellular translation by the high-throughput sequencing of short 
mRNA fragments that are protected by ribosomes from nucleolytic digestion. While 
the overall principle is simple, the workflow of ribosome profiling experiments 
is complex and challenging, and typically requires large amounts of sample, 
limiting its broad applicability. Here, we present a new protocol for 
ultra-rapid ribosome profiling from low-input samples. It features a robust 
strategy for sequencing library preparation within one day that employs solid 
phase purification of reaction intermediates, allowing to reduce the input to as 
little as 0.1 pmol of ∼30 nt RNA fragments. Hence, it is particularly suited for 
the analyses of small samples or targeted ribosome profiling. Its high 
sensitivity and its ease of implementation will foster the generation of higher 
quality data from small samples, which opens new opportunities in applying 
ribosome profiling.
