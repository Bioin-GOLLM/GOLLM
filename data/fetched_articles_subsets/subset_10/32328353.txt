BACKGROUND: Keratoconus (KTCN) is a protrusion and thinning of the cornea, 
resulting in loss of visual acuity. The etiology of KTCN remains unclear. The 
purpose of this study was to assess the potential involvement of new genetic 
variants in KTCN etiology based on both the genomic and transcriptomic findings 
recognized in the same corneal tissues.
METHODS: Corneal tissues derived from five unrelated Polish individuals with 
KTCN were examined using exome sequencing (ES), followed by enrichment analyses. 
For comparison purposes, the datasets comprising ES data of five randomly 
selected Polish individuals without ocular abnormalities and five Polish 
patients with high myopia were used. Expression levels of selected genes from 
the overrepresented pathways were obtained from the previous RNA-Seq study.
RESULTS: Exome capture discovered 117 potentially relevant variants that were 
further narrowed by gene overrepresentation analyses. In each of five patients, 
the assessment of functional interactions revealed rare (MAF ≤ 0.01) DNA 
variants in at least one gene from Wnt signaling (VANGL1, WNT1, PPP3CC, LRP6, 
FZD2) and focal adhesion (BIRC2, PAK6, COL4A4, PPP1R12A, PTK6) pathways. No 
genes involved in pathways enriched in KTCN corneas were overrepresented in our 
control sample sets.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this first pilot ES profiling of human KTCN corneas 
emphasized that accumulation of sequence variants in several genes from Wnt 
signaling and/or focal adhesion pathways might cause the phenotypic effect and 
further points to a complex etiology of KTCN.
