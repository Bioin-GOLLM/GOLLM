BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C infection is the leading cause of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), a highly lethal malignancy with rapidly increasing prevalence 
in the United States. Little is known about genetic variations and HCC risk. 
This study aimed to determine if genetic variation in Wnt signaling pathway 
genes are associated with advanced hepatic fibrosis and inflammation risk in a 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected population.
METHODS: We performed a genetic association cross-sectional study evaluating 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 58 candidate genes and risk of 
FibroSURE-Acti Test determined advanced fibrosis (F3/F4-F4 advanced cases vs. 
F0-F3 mild controls) and inflammation (A2/A3-A3 advanced cases vs. A0-A2 mild 
controls). We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
employing multivariate logistic regression. Haplotypes were inferred by the 
HAPLO.STAT program, interactions were evaluated using multifactor dimensionality 
reduction (MDR) analysis.
RESULTS: Among 425 chronically HCV-infected male veterans, 155 (37%) had 
advanced fibrosis and 180 (42%) had advanced inflammation. Of 3016 SNPs 
evaluated, eight were significantly associated with fibrosis risk (e.g., SFRP2 
rs11937424: OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.48-3.23, P = 0.00004), and seven were 
significantly associated with inflammation risk (e.g., SFRP1 rs16890282: OR = 
2.15, 95% CI 1.39-3.16, P = 0.0004). MDR analysis identified overweight/obese, 
SOST rs1405952, SFRP2 rs11937424, and FZD4 rs11234870 as the best interaction 
model for predicting risk of fibrosis; whereas race/ethnicity, FZD1 rs1346665, 
and TBX3 rs1520177 as the best interaction model for predicting risk of 
inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in several genes involved in the Wnt signaling 
pathway were associated with hepatic fibrosis or inflammation risk in 
HCV-infected males. Additional studies in other multi-ethnic HCV cohorts are 
needed to validate our findings in males and to assess if similar associations 
exist in chronically HCV-infected females.
