Senescence is a cellular stress response that results in the stable arrest of 
old, damaged or preneoplastic cells. Oncogene-induced senescence is tumor 
suppressive but can also exacerbate tumorigenesis through the secretion of 
pro-inflammatory factors from senescent cells. Drugs that selectively kill 
senescent cells, termed senolytics, have proved beneficial in animal models of 
many age-associated diseases. Here, we show that the cardiac glycoside, ouabain, 
is a senolytic agent with broad activity. Senescent cells are sensitized to 
ouabain-induced apoptosis, a process mediated in part by induction of the 
pro-apoptotic Bcl2-family protein NOXA. We show that cardiac glycosides 
synergize with anti-cancer drugs to kill tumor cells and eliminate senescent 
cells that accumulate after irradiation or in old mice. Ouabain also eliminates 
senescent preneoplastic cells. Our findings suggest that cardiac glycosides may 
be effective anti-cancer drugs by acting through multiple mechanism. Given the 
broad range of senescent cells targeted by cardiac glycosides their use against 
age-related diseases warrants further exploration.
