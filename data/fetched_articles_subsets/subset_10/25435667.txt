The GSTP1 c.313A>G polymorphism is a candidate to explain some of the individual 
differences in cardiorespiratory fitness phenotypes' responses to aerobic 
exercise training. We aim to explore the association between the GSTP1 c.313A>G 
polymorphism and the response to low-high impact aerobic exercise training. 
Sixty-six Polish Caucasian women were genotyped for the GSTP1 c.313A>G 
polymorphism; 62 of them completed 12-week aerobic (50-75% HRmax) exercise 
training and were measured for selected somatic features (body mass and BMI) and 
cardiorespiratory fitness indices - maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max, maximum heart 
rate (HRmax), maximum ventilation (VEmax) and anaerobic threshold (AT) - before 
and after the training period. Two-factor analysis of variance revealed a main 
training effect for body mass reduction (p=0.007) and BMI reduction (p=0.013), 
improvements of absolute and relative VO2max (both p<0.001), and increased VEmax 
(p=0.005), but not for changes in fat-free mass (FFM) (p=0.162). However, a 
significant training x GSTP1 c.313A>G interaction was found only for FFM 
(p=0.042), absolute and relative VO2max (p=0.029 and p=0.026), and VEmax 
(p=0.005). As the result of training, significantly greater improvements in 
VO2max, VEmax and FFM were gained by the GG+GA group compared to the AA genotype 
group. The results support the hypothesis that heterogeneity in individual 
response to training stimuli is at least in part determined by genetics, and 
GSTP1 c.313A>G may be considered as one (of what appear to be many) target 
polymorphisms to influence these changes.
