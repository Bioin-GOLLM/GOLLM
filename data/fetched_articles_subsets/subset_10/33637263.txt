Understanding ozone (O3) formation regime is a prerequisite in formulating an 
effective O3 pollution control strategy. Photochemical indicator is a simple and 
direct method in identifying O3 formation regimes. Most used indicators are 
derived from observations, whereas the role of atmospheric oxidation is not in 
consideration, which is the core driver of O3 formation. Thus, it may impact 
accuracy in signaling O3 formation regimes. In this study, an advanced 
three-dimensional numerical modeling system was used to investigate the 
relationship between atmospheric oxidation and O3 formation regimes during a 
long-lasting O3 exceedance event in September 2017 over the Pearl River Delta 
(PRD) of China. We discovered a clear relationship between atmospheric oxidative 
capacity and O3 formation regime. Over eastern PRD, O3 formation was mainly in a 
NOx-limited regime when HO2/OH ratio was higher than 11, while in a VOC-limited 
regime when the ratio was lower than 9.5. Over central and western PRD, an 
HO2/OH ratio higher than 5 and lower than 2 was indicative of NOx-limited and 
VOC-limited regime, respectively. Physical contribution, including horizontal 
transport and vertical transport, may pose uncertainties on the indication of O3 
formation regime by HO2/OH ratio. In comparison with other commonly used 
photochemical indicators, HO2/OH ratio had the best performance in 
differentiating O3 formation regimes. This study highlighted the necessities in 
using an atmospheric oxidative capacity-based indicator to infer O3 formation 
regime, and underscored the importance of characterizing behaviors of radicals 
to gain insight in atmospheric processes leading to O3 pollution over a 
photochemically active region.
