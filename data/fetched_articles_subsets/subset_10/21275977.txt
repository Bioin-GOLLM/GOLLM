PURPOSE: Given the high incidence of refractory epilepsy, novel therapeutic 
approaches and concepts are urgently needed. To date, viral-mediated delivery 
and endogenous expression of antisense sequences as a strategy to prevent 
seizures have received little attention in epilepsy therapy development efforts. 
Here we validate adenosine kinase (ADK), the astrocyte-based key negative 
regulator of the brain's endogenous anticonvulsant adenosine, as a potential 
therapeutic target for antisense-mediated seizure suppression.
METHODS: We developed adenoassociated virus 8 (AAV8)-based gene therapy vectors 
to selectively modulate ADK expression in astrocytes. Cell type selectivity was 
achieved by expressing an Adk-cDNA in sense or antisense orientation under the 
control of an astrocyte-specific gfaABC1D promoter. Viral vectors where injected 
into the CA3 of wild-type mice or spontaneously epileptic Adk-tg transgenic mice 
that overexpress ADK in brain. After virus injection, ADK expression was 
assessed histologically and biochemically. In addition, intracranial 
electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were obtained.
KEY FINDINGS: We demonstrate in wild-type mice that viral overexpression of ADK 
within astrocytes is sufficient to trigger spontaneous recurrent seizures in the 
absence of any other epileptogenic event, whereas ADK downregulation via 
AAV8-mediated RNA interference almost completely abolished spontaneous recurrent 
seizures in Adk-tg mice.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate that modulation of astrocytic ADK expression 
can trigger or prevent seizures, respectively. This is the first study to use an 
antisense approach to validate ADK as a rational therapeutic target for the 
treatment of epilepsy and suggests that gene therapies based on the knock down 
of ADK might be a feasible approach to control seizures in refractory epilepsy.
