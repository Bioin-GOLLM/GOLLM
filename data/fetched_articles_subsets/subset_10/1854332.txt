Soluble rat liver glucokinase was expressed at high levels at 22 degrees C in 
the BL21(DE3)pLysS strain of Escherichia coli. Aspartate-211 of yeast hexokinase 
has been implicated as a catalytic residue from crystallographic data. The 
corresponding residue in rat liver glucokinase, aspartate-205, was mutated to 
alanine and the expressed mutant had 1/500th of the activity of the wild type, 
with no change in the Km values for glucose or ATP. The results support a role 
for this residue as a base catalyst in the glucokinase reaction and, most 
probably, a similar role in the reactions of all members of the hexokinase 
family.
