Radioiodinated pharmaceuticals are convenient tracers for clinical and research 
investigations because of the relatively long half-lives of radioactive iodine 
isotopes (i.e., 123I, 124I, and 131I) and the ease of their chemical insertion. 
Their application in radionuclide imaging and therapy may, however, be hampered 
by poor in vivo stability of the C-I bond. After an overview of the use of 
iodine in biology and nuclear medicine, we present here a survey of the 
catabolic pathways for iodinated xenobiotics, including their biodistribution, 
accumulation, and biostability. We summarize successful rational improvements in 
the biostability and conclude with general guidelines for the design of stable 
radioiodinated pharmaceuticals. It appears to be necessary to consider the whole 
molecule, rather than the radioiodinated fragment alone. Iodine radionuclides 
are generally retained in vivo on sp2 carbon atoms in iodoarenes and iodovinyl 
moieties, but not in iodinated heterocycles or on sp3 carbon atoms. Iodoarene 
substituents also have an influence, with increased in vivo deiodination in the 
cases of iodophenols and iodoanilines, whereas methoxylation and difluorination 
improve biostability.
