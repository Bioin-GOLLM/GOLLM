OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this literature review is to summarize and provide a 
brief overview of our current understanding of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 
the role of stem cell transplantation (SCT) in its management.
BACKGROUND: AML is a malignant hematological disorder that is characterized by 
the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid blood cells. This disease has been 
associated with various risk factors such as ionizing radiation, cigarette 
smoke, pesticides/herbicides, and chemotherapy. SCT remains the most beneficial 
treatment for medically fit AML patients due to superior survival outcomes.
METHODS: A thorough search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, 
Embase and Web of Science using related keywords. Current articles on the uses 
of stem cell therapy in AML patients were selected.
CONCLUSIONS: Long term exposure to ionizing radiation and other harmful 
substances such as benzene, cigarette smoke and chemotherapeutic drugs plays an 
important role in AML carcinogenesis. Mutations in certain genes (e.g., ASXL1, 
RUNX1, KIT, TP53, BCR-ABL1) seem to accelerate the process as they affect normal 
cellular proliferation and cell death. These events may give rise to a small 
subpopulation of leukemic stem cells (LSC) which continuously sustain tumor 
development and growth. Patients who are deemed to be medically "fit" should 
receive an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) due to 
improved overall survival (OS) (~50%) and decreased relapsed risk (32% vs. 59%). 
Several studies have revealed that the medically "unfit" may benefit from more 
conventional agents such as azacytidine, decitabine, venetoclax or sorafenib.
