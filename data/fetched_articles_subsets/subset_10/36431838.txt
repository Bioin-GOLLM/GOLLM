Aberrant accumulation of β-catenin in the cell nucleus as a result of 
deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is found in various types of cancer. 
Direct β-catenin targeting agents are being researched despite obstacles; 
however, specific β-catenin drugs for clinical treatments have not been approved 
so far. We focused on direct β-catenin targeting of potential therapeutic value 
as anticancer agents. This review provides recent advances on small molecule 
β-catenin agents. Structure-activity relationships and biological activities of 
reported inhibitors are discussed. This work provides useful knowledge in the 
discovery of β-catenin agents.
