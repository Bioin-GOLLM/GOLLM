Nav channels are essential for metazoan membrane depolarization, and Nav channel 
dysfunction is directly linked with epilepsy, ataxia, pain, arrhythmia, 
myotonia, and irritable bowel syndrome. Human Nav channelopathies are primarily 
caused by variants that directly affect Nav channel permeability or gating. 
However, a new class of human Nav channelopathies has emerged based on channel 
variants that alter regulation by intracellular signaling or cytoskeletal 
proteins. Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) are a family of 
intracellular signaling proteins linked with Nav channel regulation in neurons 
and myocytes. However, to date, there is surprisingly little evidence linking 
Nav channel gene variants with FHFs and human disease. Here, we provide, to our 
knowledge, the first evidence that mutations in SCN5A (encodes primary cardiac 
Nav channel Nav1.5) that alter FHF binding result in human cardiovascular 
disease. We describe a five*generation kindred with a history of atrial and 
ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death. Affected 
family members harbor a novel SCN5A variant resulting in p.H1849R. p.H1849R is 
localized in the central binding core on Nav1.5 for FHFs. Consistent with these 
data, Nav1.5 p.H1849R affected interaction with FHFs. Further, 
electrophysiological analysis identified Nav1.5 p.H1849R as a gain-of-function 
for INa by altering steady-state inactivation and slowing the rate of Nav1.5 
inactivation. In line with these data and consistent with human cardiac 
phenotypes, myocytes expressing Nav1.5 p.H1849R displayed prolonged action 
potential duration and arrhythmogenic afterdepolarizations. Together, these 
findings identify a previously unexplored mechanism for human Nav channelopathy 
based on altered Nav1.5 association with FHF proteins.
