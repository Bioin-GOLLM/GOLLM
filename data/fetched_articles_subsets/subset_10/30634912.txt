BACKGROUND: Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4B (VPS4B) is a member 
of the ATP enzyme AAA protein family, and is mainly involved in protein 
degradation and cell membrane fusion. Recently, a dominant mutation in this gene 
was identified in human dentin dysplasia type I (DD-I). Herein, we report the 
generation of Vps4b knockout (Vps4b KO) mice; however, the homozygous Vps4b KO 
mutation was embryonic lethal at the early stages of embryo development, and we 
therefore report the results of heterozygous mutant mice.
RESULTS: Mice heterozygous for Vps4b did not develop tooth defects replicating 
human DD-I. Immunohistochemistry showed that gene KO was successful, as there 
was decreased expression of Vps4b in heterozygous mice; hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) staining also showed that the width of the pre-dentin zone was increased 
in heterozygous mice, although the arrangement of the odontoblasts was not 
significantly different from wild-type (WT) mice. However, H&E staining showed 
no obvious abnormalities in the bones of heterozygous mice. Moreover, 
stereomicroscopic and X-ray radiography results indicated no abnormal 
manifestations in teeth or bones. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the 
volume and density of dentin and enamel, as well as skeletal analysis, including 
the volume and separation of trabecular bone analyzed by micro-CT, all showed no 
differences between Vps4b heterozygotes and WT mice. In addition, there also 
were no significant differences in bone or cartilage mineralization as evaluated 
by Alcian blue-Alizarin red staining.
CONCLUSIONS: The heterozygous Vps4b KO mice do not develop tooth defects that 
replicate human DD-I and this is likely to be due to differences in tooth 
development between the two species. Consequently, further studies are needed to 
determine whether mice are an appropriate animal model for human tooth diseases.
