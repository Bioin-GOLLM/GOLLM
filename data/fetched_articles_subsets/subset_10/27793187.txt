The KRAS gene is frequently mutated in multiple cancer types, but it fell off 
the drug discovery radar for many years because of its inherent "undruggable" 
structure and undefined biological properties. As reported in the paper entitled 
"Suppression of KRas-mutant cancer through the combined inhibition of KRAS with 
PLK1 and ROCK" in Nature Communications, we performed a synthetic lethal 
screening with a combinatorial strategy on a panel of clinical drugs; we found 
that combined inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 and RhoA/Rho kinase markedly 
suppressed tumor growth in mice. An increase in the expression of the tumor 
suppressor P21WAF1/CIP1 contributed to the synergistic mechanism of the 
combination therapy. These findings open a novel avenue for the treatment of 
KRAS-mutant lung cancer.
