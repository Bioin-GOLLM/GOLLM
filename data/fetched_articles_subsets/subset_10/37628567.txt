Post-transcriptional modifications of tRNA are crucial for their core function. 
The inosine (I; 6-deaminated adenosine) at the first position in the anticodon 
of tRNAArg(ICG) modulates the decoding capability and is generally considered 
essential for reading CGU, CGC, and CGA codons in eubacteria. We report here 
that the Bacillus subtilis yaaJ gene encodes tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase 
and is non-essential for viability. A Î²-galactosidase reporter assay revealed 
that the translational activity of CGN codons was not impaired in the 
yaaJ-deletion mutant. Furthermore, tRNAArg(CCG) responsible for decoding the CGG 
codon was dispensable, even in the presence or absence of yaaJ. These results 
strongly suggest that tRNAArg with either the anticodon ICG or ACG has an 
intrinsic ability to recognize all four CGN codons, providing a fundamental 
concept of non-canonical wobbling mediated by adenosine and inosine nucleotides 
in the anticodon. This is the first example of the four-way wobbling by inosine 
nucleotide in bacterial cells. On the other hand, the absence of inosine 
modification induced +1 frameshifting, especially at the CGA codon. 
Additionally, the yaaJ deletion affected growth and competency. Therefore, the 
inosine modification is beneficial for translational fidelity and proper 
growth-phase control, and that is why yaaJ has been actually conserved in B. 
subtilis.
