Homeobox genes have a strikingly conserved 61-amino acid sequence, encoding 
DNA-binding domain. Some homeobox genes, located in four clusters are designated 
HOX A through D, while others are known as divergent homeobox genes. Many 
researchers have demonstrated that hematopoietic cells express many homeobox 
genes. Induced over- and under-expression of these genes has been used to 
demonstrate their affect on some aspects of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. 
Recently, knock-out mice of homeobox genes by targeted disruption have also been 
used to examine their hematological effect. There are examples of the aberrant 
expression of a homeobox gene causing leukemias in humans. In pre-B acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(1;19) translocation, a fusion protein is 
created between E2A and a homeobox gene PBX. In T-cell ALL with t(10;14) 
translocation, the HOX 11 gene is deregulated. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
with t(7;11) translocation, the HOX A9 gene is rearranged. In this review 
article, many functions of homeobox genes both at the early stem cell level as 
well as at the later stages of hematopoietic differentiation, and the 
leukemogenic effect of altered homeobox genes are discussed.
