While the role of the ascending dopaminergic system in brain function and 
dysfunction has been a subject of extensive research, the role of the descending 
dopaminergic system in spinal cord function and dysfunction is just beginning to 
be understood. Adenosine plays a key role in the inhibitory control of the 
ascending dopaminergic system, largely dependent on functional complexes of 
specific subtypes of adenosine and dopamine receptors. Combining a selective 
destabilizing peptide strategy with a proximity ligation assay and patch-clamp 
electrophysiology in slices from male mouse lumbar spinal cord, the present 
study demonstrates the existence of adenosine A1-dopamine D1 receptor heteromers 
in the spinal motoneuron by which adenosine tonically inhibits D1 
receptor-mediated signaling. A1-D1 receptor heteromers play a significant 
control of the motoneuron excitability, represent main targets for the 
excitatory effects of caffeine in the spinal cord and can constitute new targets 
for the pharmacological therapy after spinal cord injury, motor aging-associated 
disorders and restless legs syndrome.
