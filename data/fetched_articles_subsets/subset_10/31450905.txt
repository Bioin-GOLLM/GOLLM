Background: Glioma, most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, is 
highly aggressive and associated with a poor prognosis. Evaluate the association 
of polymorphisms related of to the cell cycle, integrity and DNA repair with 
gliomas, as well as lifestyle habits, comorbidities, survival and response to 
treatment. Methods: Were studied 303 individuals distributed into: Study Group - 
100 patients with gliomas, regardless of the degree of malignancy, and Control 
Group - 203 individuals without clinical signs of the disease. These 
polymorphisms were genotyped by TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assay. Significance level 
was set at 5%. Results: Smoking, alcohol consumption, systemic arterial 
hypertension (SAH) and diabetes mellitus (DM) prevailed in patients, compared to 
controls (P=0.0088, P=0.0001, P=0.0001, P=0.0011, respectively). In the logistic 
regression analysis, alcohol consumption and SAH were identified as independent 
risk factors for gliomas (P=0.0001, P=0.0027, respectively). Patients with 
low-grade gliomas showed survival in one year (92.0±6.8%), compared to patients 
with high-grade gliomas (24.0±5.3; P=0.011). Conclusion: Polymorphisms involved 
in cell cycle, telomere protection and stability and DNA repair are not 
associated with gliomas. On the other hand, alcohol consumption and SAH stand 
out as independent risk factors for the disease. Low-grade gliomas, response to 
treatment and the combination of chemotherapy with Temozolomide and radiation 
therapy show increased survival of patients.
