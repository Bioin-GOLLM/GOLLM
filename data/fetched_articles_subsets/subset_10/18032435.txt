Several group I introns have been previously found in strains of the Bacillus 
cereus group at three different insertion sites in the nrdE gene of the 
essential nrdIEF operon coding for ribonucleotide reductase. Here, we identify 
an uncharacterized group IA intron in the nrdF gene in 12 strains of the B. 
cereus group and show that the pre-mRNA is efficiently spliced. The Bacillus 
thuringiensis ssp. pakistani nrdF intron encodes a homing endonuclease, denoted 
I-BthII, with an unconventional GIY-(X)8-YIG motif that cleaves an intronless 
nrdF gene 7 nt upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' 
extensions. We also found four additional occurrences of two of the previously 
reported group I introns in the nrdE gene of 25 sequenced B. thuringiensis and 
one B. cereus strains, and one non-annotated group I intron at a fourth nrdE 
insertion site in the B. thuringiensis ssp. Al Hakam sequenced genome. Two 
strains contain introns in both the nrdE and the nrdF genes. Phylogenetic 
studies of the nrdIEF operon from 39 strains of the B. cereus group suggest 
several events of horizontal gene transfer for two of the introns found in this 
operon.
