BACKGROUND: Diagnostic Exome Sequencing (DES) has been shown to be an effective 
tool for diagnosis individuals with suspected genetic conditions.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a male infant born with multiple anomalies 
including bilateral dysplastic kidneys, cleft palate, bilateral talipes, and 
bilateral absence of thumbs and first toes. Prenatal testing including 
chromosome analysis and microarray did not identify a cause for the multiple 
congenital anomalies. Postnatal diagnostic exome studies (DES) were utilized to 
find a molecular diagnosis for the patient. Exome sequencing of the proband, 
mother, and father showed a previously unreported maternally inherited RNA 
binding motif protein 10 (RBM10) c.1352_1353delAG (p.E451Vfs*66) alteration. 
Mutations in RBM10 are associated with TARP syndrome, an X-linked recessive 
disorder originally described with cardinal features of talipes equinovarus, 
atrial septal defect, Robin sequence, and persistent left superior vena cava.
CONCLUSION: DES established a molecular genetic diagnosis of TARP syndrome for a 
neonatal patient with a poor prognosis in whom traditional testing methods were 
uninformative and allowed for efficient diagnosis and future reproductive 
options for the parents. Other reported cases of TARP syndrome demonstrate 
significant variability in clinical phenotype. The reported features in this 
infant including multiple hemivertebrae, imperforate anus, aplasia of thumbs and 
first toes have not been reported in previous patients, thus expanding the 
clinical phenotype for this rare disorder.
