Recent compelling research has demonstrated a pathophysiologic role for 
proinflammatory cytokines of microglial origin in decreasing neurocognitive 
function. Psychiatric diseases are already known to have reduced cognitive 
function and are also associated with increased inflammation. To elaborate on 
these data, our study aims to investigate how a particular polymorphism of the 
tumor necrosis factor gene, TNF-α -1031T/C, affects neurocognitive performance 
in patients with schizophrenia. We recruited 905 patients with schizophrenia and 
571 healthy control subjects. We employed the Repeatable Battery for the 
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) to test for neurocognitive 
function and the positive and negative syndrome scale to evaluate schizophrenia 
severity. The -1031T/C polymorphism was genotyped in both healthy controls and 
schizophrenic patients. Our results demonstrate that patients with the C allele 
(either T/C or C/C) possessed increased immediate memory index, 
visuospatial/constructional index, and RBANS total scores as compared to 
patients without it (p < .05). In healthy controls, there was no significant 
difference across genotypes (p > .05). Our findings demonstrate that the TNF-α 
-1031T/C polymorphism may not play a role in the susceptibility of schizophrenia 
itself, but may be involved in the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. This 
suggests an important role for cytokine signaling in mediating the severity of 
cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.
