DNA methylation (meDNA) is a modulator of alternative splicing, and splicing 
perturbations are involved in tumorigenesis nearly as frequently as DNA 
mutations. However, the impact of meDNA on tumorigenesis via splicing-mediated 
mechanisms has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we found that HCT116 colon 
carcinoma cells inactivated for the DNA methylases DNMT1/3b undergo a partial 
epithelial to mesenchymal transition associated with increased CD44 variant exon 
skipping. These skipping events are directly mediated by the loss of intragenic 
meDNA and the chromatin factors MBD1/2/3 and HP1γ and are also linked to 
phosphorylation changes in elongating RNA polymerase II. The role of meDNA in 
alternative splicing was confirmed by using the dCas9/DNMT3b tool. We further 
tested whether the meDNA level could have predictive value in the MCF10A model 
for breast cancer progression and in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(B ALL). We found that a small number of differentially spliced genes, mostly 
involved in splicing and signal transduction, are correlated with the local 
modulation of meDNA. Our observations suggest that, although DNA methylation has 
multiple avenues to affect alternative splicing, its indirect effect may also be 
mediated through alternative splicing isoforms of these meDNA sensors.
