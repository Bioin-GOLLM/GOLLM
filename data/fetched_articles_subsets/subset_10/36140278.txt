Pregnancies with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have a high incidence of 
large-for-gestational-age neonates (LGA) despite optimal glycemic control. In 
recent years, glycemic variability (GV) has emerged as a possible risk factor 
for LGA, but the results of the conducted studies are unclear. This study 
analyzed the association between GV and LGA development in pregnancies with 
T1DM. This was a prospective cohort study of patients with T1DM who used 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) during pregnancy. Patients were followed 
from the first trimester to birth. GV parameters were calculated for every 
trimester using the EasyGV calculator. The main outcomes were LGA or no-LGA. 
Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between GV 
parameters and LGA. In total, 66 patients were included. The incidence of LGA 
was 36%. The analysis extracted several GV parameters that were significantly 
associated with the risk of LGA. The J-index was the only significant parameter 
in every trimester of pregnancy (odds ratios with confidence intervals were 1.33 
(1.02, 1.73), 3.18 (1.12, 9.07), and 1.37 (1.03, 1.82), respectively. Increased 
GV is a risk factor for development of LGA. The J-index is a possible novel GV 
parameter that may be assessed in all three trimesters of pregnancy together 
with glycated hemoglobin and time-in-range.
