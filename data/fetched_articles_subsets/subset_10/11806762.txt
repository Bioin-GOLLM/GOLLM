BACKGROUND: The L-type Ca2+ channel formed by the dihydropyridine receptor 
(DHPR) of skeletal muscle senses the membrane voltage and opens the ryanodine 
receptor (RyR1). This channel-to-channel coupling is essential for Ca2+ 
signaling but poorly understood. We characterized a single-base frame-shift 
mutant of alpha1S, the pore subunit of the DHPR, that has the unusual ability to 
function voltage sensor for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling by virtue of 
expressing two complementary hemi-Ca2+ channel fragments.
RESULTS: Functional analysis of cDNA transfected dysgenic myotubes lacking 
alpha1S were carried out using voltage-clamp, confocal Ca2+ indicator 
fluoresence, epitope immunofluorescence and immunoblots of expressed proteins. 
The frame-shift mutant (fs-alpha1S) expressed the N-terminal half of alpha1S (M1 
to L670) and the C-terminal half starting at M701 separately. The C-terminal 
fragment was generated by an unexpected restart of translation of the fs-alpha1S 
message at M701 and was eliminated by a M701I mutation. Protein-protein 
complementation between the two fragments produced recovery of skeletal-type EC 
coupling but not L-type Ca2+ current.
DISCUSSION: A premature stop codon in the II-III loop may not necessarily cause 
a loss of DHPR function due to a restart of translation within the II-III loop, 
presumably by a mechanism involving leaky ribosomal scanning. In these cases, 
function is recovered by expression of complementary protein fragments from the 
same cDNA. DHPR-RyR1 interactions can be achieved via protein-protein 
complementation between hemi-Ca2+ channel proteins, hence an intact II-III loop 
is not essential for coupling the DHPR voltage sensor to the opening of RyR1 
channel.
