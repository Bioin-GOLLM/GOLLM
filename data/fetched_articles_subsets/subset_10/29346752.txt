N6-methyladenosine (m6A) affects multiple aspects of mRNA metabolism and 
regulates developmental transitions by promoting mRNA decay. Little is known 
about the role of m6A in the adult mammalian nervous system. Here we report that 
sciatic nerve lesion elevates levels of m6A-tagged transcripts encoding many 
regeneration-associated genes and protein translation machinery components in 
the adult mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Single-base resolution m6A-CLIP 
mapping further reveals a dynamic m6A landscape in the adult DRG upon injury. 
Loss of either m6A methyltransferase complex component Mettl14 or m6A-binding 
protein Ythdf1 globally attenuates injury-induced protein translation in adult 
DRGs and reduces functional axon regeneration in the peripheral nervous system 
in vivo. Furthermore, Pten deletion-induced axon regeneration of retinal 
ganglion neurons in the adult central nervous system is attenuated upon Mettl14 
knockdown. Our study reveals a critical epitranscriptomic mechanism in promoting 
injury-induced protein synthesis and axon regeneration in the adult mammalian 
nervous system.
