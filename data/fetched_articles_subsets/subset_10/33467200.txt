Marine fungi produce many halogenated metabolites with a variety of structures, 
from acyclic entities with a simple linear chain to multifaceted polycyclic 
molecules. Over the past few decades, their pharmaceutical and medical 
application have been explored and still the door is kept open due to the need 
of new drugs from relatively underexplored sources. Biological properties of 
halogenated compounds such as anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, 
anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antifouling, and insecticidal activity have been 
investigated. This review describes the chemical structures and biological 
activities of 217 halogenated compounds derived mainly from Penicillium and 
Aspergillus marine fungal strains reported from 1994 to 2019.
