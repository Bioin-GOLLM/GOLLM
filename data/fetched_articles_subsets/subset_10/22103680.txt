BACKGROUND: Sequence variants in genes functioning in folate-mediated one-carbon 
metabolism are hypothesized to lead to changes in levels of homocysteine and DNA 
methylation, which, in turn, are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: 330 SNPs in 52 genes were studied in relation to plasma homocysteine 
and global genomic DNA methylation. SNPs were selected based on functional 
effects and gene coverage, and assays were completed on the Illumina Goldengate 
platform. Age-, smoking-, and nutrient-adjusted genotype--phenotype associations 
were estimated in regression models.
RESULTS: Using a nominal P â‰¤ 0.005 threshold for statistical significance, 20 
SNPs were associated with plasma homocysteine, 8 with Alu methylation, and 1 
with LINE-1 methylation. Using a more stringent false discovery rate threshold, 
SNPs in FTCD, SLC19A1, and SLC19A3 genes remained associated with plasma 
homocysteine. Gene by vitamin B-6 interactions were identified for both Alu and 
LINE-1 methylation, and epistatic interactions with the MTHFR rs1801133 SNP were 
identified for the plasma homocysteine phenotype. Pleiotropy involving the 
MTHFD1L and SARDH genes for both plasma homocysteine and Alu methylation 
phenotypes was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: No single gene was associated with all three phenotypes, and the 
set of the most statistically significant SNPs predictive of homocysteine or Alu 
or LINE-1 methylation was unique to each phenotype. Genetic variation in 
folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, other than the well-known effects of the 
MTHFR c.665C>T (known as c.677 C>T, rs1801133, p.Ala222Val), is predictive of 
cardiovascular disease biomarkers.
