BACKGROUND: Neonatal hydrocephalus is a congenital abnormality resulting in an 
inflammatory response and microglial cell activation both clinically and in 
animal models. Previously, we reported a mutation in a motile cilia gene, Ccdc39 
that develops neonatal progressive hydrocephalus (prh) with inflammatory 
microglia. We discovered significantly increased amoeboid-shaped activated 
microglia in periventricular white matter edema, reduced mature homeostatic 
microglia in grey matter, and reduced myelination in the prh model. Recently, 
the role of microglia in animal models of adult brain disorders was examined 
using cell type-specific ablation by colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor 
(CSF1R) inhibitor, however, little information exists regarding the role of 
microglia in neonatal brain disorders such as hydrocephalus. Therefore, we aim 
to see if ablating pro-inflammatory microglia, and thus suppressing the 
inflammatory response, in a neonatal hydrocephalic mouse line could have 
beneficial effects.
METHODS: In this study, Plexxikon 5622 (PLX5622), a CSF1R inhibitor, was 
subcutaneously administered to wild-type (WT) and prh mutant mice daily from 
postnatal day (P) 3 to P7. MRI-estimated brain volume was compared with 
untreated WT and prh mutants P7-9 and immunohistochemistry of the brain sections 
was performed at P8 and P18-21.
RESULTS: PLX5622 injections successfully ablated IBA1-positive microglia in both 
the WT and prh mutants at P8. Of the microglia that are resistant to PLX5622 
treatment, there was a higher percentage of amoeboid-shaped microglia, 
identified by morphology with retracted processes. In PLX-treated prh mutants, 
there was increased ventriculomegaly and no change in the total brain volume was 
observed. Also, the PLX5622 treatment significantly reduced myelination in WT 
mice at P8, although this was recovered after full microglia repopulation by 
P20. Microglia repopulation in the mutants worsened hypomyelination at P20.
CONCLUSIONS: Microglia ablation in the neonatal hydrocephalic brain does not 
improve white matter edema, and actually worsens ventricular enlargement and 
hypomyelination, suggesting critical functions of homeostatic ramified microglia 
to better improve brain development with neonatal hydrocephalus. Future studies 
with detailed examination of microglial development and status may provide a 
clarification of the need for microglia in neonatal brain development.
