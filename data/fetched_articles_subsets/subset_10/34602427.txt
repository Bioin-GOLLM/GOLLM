Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 gene (STAT6) is an important 
player of inflammatory pathways. The role of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) of STAT6 to the risk of asthma or IgE has been studied in several 
populations. We examined STAT6 SNP in relation to asthma risk among Pakistani 
individuals, suffering from asthma. We genotyped STAT6 SNP rs1059513 using 
SNaPshot minisequencing assay. SNP association analysis was statistically 
confirmed by linkage disequilibrium calculator and online SHEsis software. 
SigniÔ¨Åcance of differences between asthmatics and control group was tested for 
genotypes and allele frequencies. Our results indicated that STAT6 polymorphism 
rs1059513 has no association with asthma in Pakistani population as any 
difference in allele frequency and genotype was not observed between asthmatics 
and controls. The present study to date is very first of genetic variation in 
STAT6 and asthma risk, designed for evidence of the STAT6 involvement in asthma 
risk in Pakistani population.
