Synaptic circuits in the brain are precisely organized, but the processes that 
govern this precision are poorly understood. Here, we explore how distinct 
embryonic neural progenitor pools in the lateral ganglionic eminence contribute 
to neuronal diversity and synaptic circuit connectivity in the mouse striatum. 
In utero labeling of Tα1-expressing apical intermediate progenitors (aIP), as 
well as other progenitors (OP), reveals that both progenitors generate direct 
and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs) with similar 
electrophysiological and anatomical properties and are intermingled in medial 
striatum. Subsequent optogenetic circuit-mapping experiments demonstrate that 
progenitor origin significantly impacts long-range excitatory input strength, 
with medial prefrontal cortex preferentially driving aIP-derived SPNs and visual 
cortex preferentially driving OP-derived SPNs. In contrast, the strength of 
local inhibitory inputs among SPNs is controlled by birthdate rather than 
progenitor origin. Combined, these results demonstrate distinct roles for 
embryonic progenitor origin in shaping neuronal and circuit properties of the 
postnatal striatum.
