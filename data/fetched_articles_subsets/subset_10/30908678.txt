Recently, a loss of function variant (rs72613567) in 17-beta-hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) has been identified as protective of nonalcoholic 
(NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the role of this 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the development of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) is currently unknown. A total of 3,315 European patients with 
HCC (n = 1,109) or without HCC, but with chronic liver disease (CLD; n = 2,206), 
from four centers were analyzed either by whole-exome sequencing (WES; 
exploratory cohort, 285 HCC) or genotyped for HSD17B13 rs72613567 (validation 
cohort, 824 HCC and all CLD). We included a control group of 33,337 healthy 
European individuals from the Exome Aggregation Consortium. We compared 
distribution of genotype using the chi-square test and logistic regression. In 
the exploratory cohort analyzed by WES, frequency of the TA allele of HSD17B13 
rs72613567 was significantly decreased in HCC patients compared to healthy 
controls (P = 1.52 × 10-06 ). In the validation cohort, frequency of TA allele 
carriers was also decreased in patients with CLD and without HCC (39%) compared 
to healthy individuals (47%; P < 0.0001). The protective effect of the TA allele 
of HSD17B13 rs72613567 was identified in patients with ALD (odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.82; P < 0.0001), NAFLD 
(OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49-0.83; P = 0.0007), and hepatitis C (OR = 0.71; 95% CI, 
0.60-0.85; P = 0.0002). In patients with ALD, the proportion of TA allele 
carriers with HCC was significantly lower (32%) than in CLD patients without HCC 
(40%), even after adjustment for age, sex, and fibrosis (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 
0.46-0.87; P = 0.005). Conclusion: The HSD17B13 rs72613567 loss of function 
variant is protective of HCC development in patients with ALD.
