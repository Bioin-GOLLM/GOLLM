The immunosuppressive activity of three pentapeptides related to the C-terminal 
fragments of tachykinins was investigated using the PFC (plaque forming cell) 
test. The peptides were of the general structure Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2, with 
Tyr, Val and Ile in X position, respectively. The results were compared with 
those obtained previously for the substance P (SP) C-terminal pentapeptide. It 
was found that peptides containing aromatic residues in X position were more 
potent immunosuppressors than peptides containing aliphatic residues in the same 
position. The results also suggest that in mammalian organisms substance SP may 
be involved in immunomodulation which is rather not the case with other 
mammalian tachykinins (neurokinin A and neurokinin B).
