Platelets participate in many important physiological processes, including 
hemostasis and immunity. However, despite their broad participation in these 
evolutionarily critical roles, the anucleate platelet is uniquely mammalian. In 
contrast with the large nucleated equivalents in lower vertebrates, we find that 
the design template for the evolutionary specialization of platelets shares 
remarkable similarities with human-engineered unmanned aerial vehicles in terms 
of overall autonomy, maneuverability, and expendability. Here, we review 
evidence illustrating how platelets are uniquely suited for surveillance and the 
manner in which they consequently provide various types of support to other cell 
types.
