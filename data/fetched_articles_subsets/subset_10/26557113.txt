New reassortant H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses were isolated 
from waterfowl in Southern China. Blast analysis demonstrated that the PB2 gene 
in these viruses were most closely related to A/wild duck/Shangdong/628/2011 
(H5N1), while their NP genes were both more closely related to A/wild 
duck/Shandong/1/2011 (H5N1) and A/duck/Jiangsu/k1203/2010 (H5N8). However, the 
HA, NA, PB1, PA, M, and NS genes had the highest identity with 
A/duck/Jiangsu/k1203/2010 (H5N8). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that their HA 
genes belonged to the same GsGd H5 clade 2.3.4.4 detected in China in 2010. 
Therefore, we supposed that these H5N8 viruses might be novel reassortant 
viruses that have a H5N8 backbone while acquiring PB2 and NP genes from H5N1 
viruses. This study is useful for better understanding the genetic and antigenic 
evolution of H5 avian influenza viruses in Southern China.
