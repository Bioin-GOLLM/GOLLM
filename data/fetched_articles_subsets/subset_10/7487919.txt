The human mannose-binding protein (MBP) is a pattern recognition molecule that 
appears to play a role in initial host defence. MBP activates the complement 
cascade and it may act as an opsonin both in the absence and in the presence of 
complement. A number of distinct MBP allelic forms exist in different population 
groups. An allele that occurs in 5-7% of Caucasians was identified by an 
inability to activate the complement system. A homozygous mutation at base pair 
230 of the MBP gene results in a Gly-to-Asp substitution at the fifth collagen 
repeat. It appears that the resultant protein, MBPD, is able to form high-order 
multimers that bind bacteria but do not support complement activation. Recently 
a novel serine protease, the MBP-associated serine protease (MASP), has been 
described. MBP-MASP complexes circulate in serum and result in the direct 
activation of a novel complement pathway (lectin pathway) in the absence of the 
first complement components. In this study we demonstrate that MASP and its 
proenzyme proMASP are unable to bind to recombinant (r)MBPD. This lack of a 
MASP-rMBPD association corresponds to a failure of the Gly-54-->Asp form of MBP 
to activate complement. Our results provide a biochemical basis for the 
functional deficit in the Gly-54-->Asp allelic form of MBP and suggest that the 
proMASP/MASP binding site maps to the fifth collagen repeat of MBP.
