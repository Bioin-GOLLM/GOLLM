Rat CD39, a membrane-bound ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase that 
hydrolyzes extracellular nucleoside tri- and diphosphates, is anchored to the 
membrane by two transmembrane domains at the two ends of the molecule. The 
transmembrane domains are important for enzymatic activity, as mutants lacking 
one or both of these domains have a fraction of the enzymatic activity of the 
wild-type CD39. We investigated the interactions between the transmembrane 
domains by using a strain of yeast that requires surface expression of CD39 for 
growth. Random mutagenesis of selected amino acid residues in the N-terminal 
transmembrane domain revealed that the presence of charged amino acids at these 
positions prevents expression of functional protein. Rescue of the growth of 
these mutants by complementary mutations on selected residues of the C-terminal 
transmembrane domain indicates that there is contact between particular faces of 
the transmembrane domains.
