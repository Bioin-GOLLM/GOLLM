We developed Cre-loxP-based systems, termed CRTEIL and CETRIZ, which allow gene 
switching in a noninvasive manner. Single transfection with pCRTEIL resulted in 
predominant expression of red fluorescence. Cotransfection with pCRTEIL and 
Cre-expression plasmid (pCAG/NCre) caused switching from red to green 
fluorescence. Similarly, cotransfection with pCETRIZ and pCAG/NCre resulted in 
change of green to red fluorescence. These noninvasive systems will be useful in 
cell lineage analysis, since descendants of cells exhibiting newly activated 
gene expression can be continuously monitored in noninvasive fashion.
