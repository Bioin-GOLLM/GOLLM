BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important cause of chronic 
liver disease which has been affected 3% of world's population. Some studies 
have shown that adding Sofosbuvir (SOF), an HCV polymerase inhibitor to the 
conventional therapy of Pegylated-interferon (PegIFN) plus Ribavirin (RBV) can 
increase the rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) among HCV-infected 
patients. This study was conducted to determine the effect of combination 
therapy with PegIFN and RBV plus SOF for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 
infection using systematic review with meta-analysis.
METHODS: In this study, electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Science 
Direct, and Web of Science were comprehensively searched using appropriate 
strategies containing all related keywords of "hepatitis C", "PegIFN", "RBV" and 
"SOF". Studies assessed the efficacy of combination therapy with PegIFN and RBV 
plus SOF for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection were included in the 
meta-analysis.
RESULTS: After screening of 757 records, we included five articles with total 
sample size of 411 to the meta-analysis. Based on the fixed-effect model (χ 
2 = 5.29, P = 0.26 and I2 = 24.4%), pooled SVR rate for treatment regimen of 
PegIFN and RBV plus SOF was calculated as 88.54% (95% CI = 85.77%-91.32%).
CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with PegIFN and RBV plus SOF results in high 
treatment response in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection.
