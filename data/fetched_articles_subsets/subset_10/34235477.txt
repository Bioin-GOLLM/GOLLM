Trimeric photosystem I from the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus 
(TePSI) is an intrinsic membrane protein, which converts solar energy into 
electrical energy by oxidizing the soluble redox mediator cytochrome c 6 (Cyt c 
6 ) and reducing ferredoxin. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy and small 
angle neutron scattering (SANS) to characterize the transient binding of Cyt c 6 
to TePSI. The structure of TePSI cross-linked to Cyt c 6 was solved at a 
resolution of 2.9 Å and shows additional cofactors as well as side chain density 
for 84% of the peptide chain of subunit PsaK, revealing a hydrophobic, membrane 
intrinsic loop that enables binding of associated proteins. Due to the poor 
binding specificity, Cyt c 6 could not be localized with certainty in our 
cryo-EM analysis. SANS measurements confirm that Cyt c 6 does not bind to TePSI 
at protein concentrations comparable to those for cross-linking. However, SANS 
data indicate a complex formation between TePSI and the non-native mitochondrial 
cytochrome from horse heart (Cyt c HH ). Our study pinpoints the difficulty of 
identifying very small binding partners (less than 5% of the overall size) in EM 
structures when binding affinities are poor. We relate our results to well 
resolved co-structures with known binding affinities and recommend confirmatory 
methods for complexes with K M values higher than 20 μM.
