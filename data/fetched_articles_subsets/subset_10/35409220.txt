Disturbances in the glutamatergic system have been increasingly documented in 
several neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
Glutamate-centered theories of ASD are based on evidence from patient samples 
and postmortem studies, as well as from studies documenting abnormalities in 
glutamatergic gene expression and metabolic pathways, including changes in the 
gut microbiota glutamate metabolism in patients with ASD. In addition, 
preclinical studies on animal models have demonstrated glutamatergic 
neurotransmission deficits and altered expression of glutamate synaptic 
proteins. At present, there are no approved glutamatergic drugs for ASD, but 
several ongoing clinical trials are currently focusing on evaluating in autistic 
patients glutamatergic pharmaceuticals already approved for other conditions. In 
this review, we provide an overview of the literature concerning the role of 
glutamatergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of ASD and as a potential 
target for novel treatments.
