Paediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common 
chronic liver disease in childhood. Obesity is the main risk factor. Nutrition 
and lifestyle are the key elements in preventing and treating NAFLD in the 
absence of approved drug therapy. Whilst recommendations and studies on 
macronutrients (carbohydrates, fat and protein) in adult NAFLD exist, the 
discussion of this topic in paediatric NAFLD remains contradictory. The purpose 
of this review is to provide state-of-the-art knowledge on the role of 
macronutrients in paediatric NAFLD regarding quality and quantity. PubMed was 
searched and original studies and review articles were included in this review. 
Fructose, sucrose, saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids and ω-6-fatty-acids 
are strongly associated with paediatric NAFLD. High consumption of fibre, diets 
with a low glycaemic index, mono-unsaturated-fatty-acids and ω-3-fatty-acids 
reduce the risk of childhood-onset NAFLD. Data regarding the role of dietary 
protein in NAFLD are contradictory. No single diet is superior in treating 
paediatric NAFLD, although the composition of macronutrients in the 
Mediterranean Diet appears beneficial. Moreover, the optimal proportions of 
total macronutrients in the diet of paediatric NAFLD patients are unknown. 
Maintaining a eucaloric diet and avoiding saturated fatty acids, simple sugars 
(mainly fructose) and a high-caloric Western Diet are supported by literature.
