The inhibitory interaction of phospholamban (PLN) with the sarco(endo)plasmic 
reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase isoform 1 (SERCA1a) was modeled on the basis of several 
constraints which included (i) spontaneous formation of SS-bridges between 
mutants L321C in transmembrane helix 4 (M4) of SERCA1a and N27C in PLN and 
between V89C (M4) and V49C (PLN); (ii) definition of the face of the PLN 
transmembrane helix that interacts with SERCA; (iii) cross-linking between Lys-3 
of PLN and Lys-397 and Lys-400 of SERCA2a. The crystal structure of SERCA1a in 
the absence of Ca(2+), which binds PLN, was used as the structure into which an 
atomic model of PLN was built. PLN can fit into a transmembrane groove formed by 
the juxtaposition of M2, the upper part of M4, M6, and M9. In the SERCA1a 
structure with bound Ca(2+), this groove is closed, accounting for the ability 
of Ca(2+) to disrupt PLN-SERCA interactions. Near the cytoplasmic surface of the 
bilayer, the PLN helix is disrupted to prevent its collision with M4. The model 
can be extended into the cytoplasmic domain so that Lys-3 in PLN can be 
cross-linked with Lys-397 and Lys-400 in SERCA1a with little unwinding of the 
N-terminal helix of PLN.
