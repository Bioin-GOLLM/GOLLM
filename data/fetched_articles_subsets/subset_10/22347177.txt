Given that human trust behavior is heritable and intranasal administration of 
oxytocin enhances trust, the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene is an excellent 
candidate to investigate genetic contributions to individual variations in trust 
behavior. Although a single-nucleotide polymorphism involving an adenine 
(A)/guanine (G) transition (rs53576) has been associated with socio-emotional 
phenotypes, its link to trust behavior is unclear. We combined genotyping of 
healthy male students (n = 108) with the administration of a trust game 
experiment. Our results show that a common occurring genetic variation (rs53576) 
in the OXTR gene is reliably associated with trust behavior rather than a 
general increase in trustworthy or risk behaviors. Individuals homozygous for 
the G allele (GG) showed higher trust behavior than individuals with A allele 
carriers (AA/AG). Although the molecular functionality of this polymorphism is 
still unknown, future research should clarify how the OXTR gene interacts with 
other genes and the environment in promoting socio-emotional behaviors.
