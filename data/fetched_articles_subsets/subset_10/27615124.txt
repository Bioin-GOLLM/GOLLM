Hsp90 is a dimeric molecular chaperone responsible for the folding, maturation, 
and activation of hundreds of substrate proteins called 'clients'. Numerous 
co-chaperone proteins regulate progression through the ATP-dependent client 
activation cycle. The most potent stimulator of the Hsp90 ATPase activity is the 
co-chaperone Aha1p. Only one molecule of Aha1p is required to fully stimulate 
the Hsp90 dimer despite the existence of two, presumably identical, binding 
sites for this regulator. Using ATPase assays with Hsp90 heterodimers, we find 
that Aha1p stimulates ATPase activity by a three-step mechanism via the 
catalytic loop in the middle domain of Hsp90. Binding of the Aha1p N domain to 
the Hsp90 middle domain exerts a small stimulatory effect but also drives a 
separate conformational rearrangement in the Hsp90 N domains. This second event 
drives a rearrangement in the N domain of the opposite subunit and is required 
for the stimulatory action of the Aha1p C domain. Furthermore, the second event 
can be blocked by a mutation in one subunit of the Hsp90 dimer but not the 
other. This work provides a foundation for understanding how post-translational 
modifications regulate co-chaperone engagement with the Hsp90 dimer.
