The 72-kDa immediate-early 1 protein (IE1-72kDa) of human cytomegalovirus has 
been previously shown to be posttranslationally modified by covalent conjugation 
to the ubiquitin-related protein SUMO-1. Using an infectious bacterial 
artificial chromosome clone of human cytomegalovirus, we constructed a mutant 
virus (BADpmIE1-K450R) that is deficient for SUMOylation of IE1-72 kDa due to a 
single amino acid exchange in the SUMO-1 attachment site. Compared to wild-type 
virus, this mutant grew more slowly and generated a reduced yield in infected 
human fibroblasts, indicating that SUMO modification is required for the full 
activity of IE1-72 kDa. The lack of SUMOylation did not affect the intranuclear 
localization of IE1-72 kDa, including its ability to target to and disrupt PML 
bodies and to bind to mitotic chromatin. Likewise, SUMOylation-deficient IE1-72 
kDa activated several viral promoters as efficiently as the wild-type protein. 
However, the failure to modify IE1-72 kDa resulted in substantially reduced 
levels of the IE2 transcript and its 86-kDa protein (IE2-86 kDa). These 
observations suggest that SUMO modification of IE1-72 kDa contributes to 
efficient HCMV replication by promoting the accumulation of IE2-86 kDa.
