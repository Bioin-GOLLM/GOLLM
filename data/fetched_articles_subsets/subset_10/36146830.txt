African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of African swine fever 
(ASF), resulting in up to 100% mortality in pigs. Although endemic in most 
sub-Saharan African countries, where all known ASFV genotypes have been 
reported, the disease has caused pandemics of significant economic impact in 
Eurasia, and no vaccines or therapeutics are available to date. In endeavors to 
develop live-attenuated vaccines against ASF, deletions of several of the ~170 
ASFV genes have shown contrasting results depending on the genotype of the 
investigated ASFV. Here, we report the in vivo outcome of a single deletion of 
the A238L (5EL) gene and double deletions of A238L (5EL) and EP402R (CD2v) genes 
from the genome of a highly virulent genotype IX ASFV isolate. Domestic pigs 
were intramuscularly inoculated with (i) ASFV-Ke-ΔA238L to assess the safety of 
A238L deletion and (ii) ASFV-Ke-ΔEP402RΔA238L to investigate protection against 
challenge with the virulent wildtype ASFV-Ke virus. While A238L (5EL) gene 
deletion did not yield complete attenuation, co-deletion of A238L (5EL) and 
EP402R (CD2v) improved the safety profile of the single deletions, eliciting 
both humoral and cellular immune responses and conferred partial protection 
against challenge with the virulent wildtype ASFV-Ke virus.
