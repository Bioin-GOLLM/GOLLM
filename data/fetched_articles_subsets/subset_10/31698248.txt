Sustained treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer with 
ER-targeting drugs results in ER mutations and refractory unresponsive cancers. 
Androgen receptor (AR), which is expressed in 80%-95% of ER-positive breast 
cancers, could serve as an alternate therapeutic target. Although AR agonists 
were used in the past to treat breast cancer, their use is currently infrequent 
due to virilizing side effects. Discovery of tissue-selective AR modulators 
(SARMs) has renewed interest in using AR agonists to treat breast cancer. Using 
translational models, we show that AR agonist and SARM, but not antagonist, 
inhibit the proliferation and growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells, 
patient-derived tissues, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Ligand-activated 
AR inhibits wild-type and mutant ER activity by reprogramming the ER and FOXA1 
cistrome and rendering tumor growth inhibition. These findings suggest that 
ligand-activated AR may function as a non-canonical inhibitor of ER and that AR 
agonists may offer a safe and effective treatment for ER-positive breast cancer.
