IMPORTANCE: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndrome is an autosomal 
dominant, hereditary cancer disorder caused by germline mutations in the RET 
(formerly MEN2A, MEN2B) proto-oncogene located on chromosomal band 10q11.21. Two 
distinct clinical forms have been described as the following phenotypes: 
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) and multiple endocrine neoplasia 
type 2B (MEN 2B) syndromes. The common and necessary nexus that defines these 2 
phenotypes is the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The familial 
MTC type of MEN 2 syndrome was included within the spectrum of MEN 2A syndrome. 
Cutaneous manifestations of MEN 2A syndrome include macular amyloidosis, whereas 
MEN 2B syndrome is traditionally linked to multiple mucosal neuromas.
OBJECTIVES: To describe a family with cutaneous manifestations not previously 
described in patients with MEN 2A syndrome and to discuss the association of 
this disorder with Cowden syndrome.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Clinicopathologic correlation of cutaneous 
lesions and genetic studies in 11 members of a family with familial MTC.
INTERVENTIONS: Cutaneous lesions were histopathologically and 
immunohistochemically studied. Genetic screening for a germline mutation at the 
RET gene was performed in 11 family members.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Identification of cutaneous lesions not previously 
described in patients with MEN 2A syndrome.
RESULTS: This family of 11 individuals with familial MTC type of MEN 2A syndrome 
demonstrated the moderate risk RET p.Val804Met (protein valine at residue 804 
replaced by methionine) genetic mutation, with 2 of the relatives presenting 
with dermal hyperneury, cutaneous lesions classically described in MEN 2B 
syndrome, and 1 relative also showing multiple sclerotic fibromas, a cutaneous 
manifestation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) hamartoma-tumor 
syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Dermal hyperneury and multiple sclerotic fibromas 
should be added to the list of cutaneous manifestations of patients with the 
familial MTC type of MEN 2A syndrome.
