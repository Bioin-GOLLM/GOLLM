BACKGROUND: The potential pathophysiological role of common SCN5A polymorphisms 
in cardiac arrhythmias has been increasingly recognized. However, little is 
known about the impact of those polymorphisms on the pharmocological response of 
hNav1.5 to various antiarrhythmic agents.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The known SCN5A polymorphism, S524Y, was studied in 
comparison with the wild type (WT) in [corrected] the SCN5A-Q1077del variant. 
The ion channel gating kinetics and pharmacology were evaluated using whole-cell 
patch-clamp methods in HEK-293 cells. Consistent with a previous report, the 
basal ion channel gating kinetics of S524Y were indistinguishable from the WT. 
Quinidine (20 microM) caused similar extent of tonic block reduction of sodium 
currents at -120 mV in WT and S524Y. Surprisingly, quinidine (20 microM) exerted 
a more use-dependent block by a 10 Hz pulse train in S524Y than in WT at 22 
degrees C (Ki: WT, 51.3 microM; S524Y, 20.3 microM). S524Y significantly delayed 
recovery from the use-dependent block, compared with the WT (tau= 88.6 +/- 7.9 s 
vs 41.9 +/- 6.6 s, P < 0.005). Under more physiological conditions using a 2 Hz 
pulse train at 37 degrees C, S524Y similarly enhanced the use-dependent block by 
quinidine. In addition, S524Y enhanced the use-dependent block by flecainide 
(12.5 microM), but not by mexiletine (100 microM).
CONCLUSION: A common SCN5A polymorphism, S524Y, can enhance a use-dependent 
block by class Ia and Ic antiarrhythmic agents. Our findings may have clinical 
implications in pharmacological management of cardiac arrhythmias since this 
common SCN5A polymorphism might be a contributing factor to the variable 
antiarrhythmic response.
