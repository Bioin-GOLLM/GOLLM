The medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DBB) receives direct GABAergic 
input from the hippocampus via hippocamposeptal (HS) projection neurons as part 
of a reciprocal loop that mediates cognition and is altered in Alzheimer's 
disease. Cholinergic and GABAergic interactions occur throughout the MS/DBB, but 
it is not known how HS GABA release is impacted by these circuits. Most HS 
neurons contain somatostatin (SST), so to evoke HS GABA release we expressed 
Cre-dependent mCherry/channelrhodopisin-2 (ChR2) in the hippocampi of 
SST-IRES-Cre mice and then used optogenetics to stimulate HS fibers while 
performing whole-cell patch clamp recordings from MS/DBB neurons in acute 
slices. We found that the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) agonist carbachol and 
the GABAB receptor (GABABR) agonist baclofen significantly decreased HS GABA 
release in the MS/DBB. Carbachol's effects were blocked by eliminating local 
GABAergic activity or inhibiting GABABRs, indicating that it was indirectly 
decreasing HS GABA release by increasing GABAergic tone. There was no effect of 
acute exposure to amyloid-Î² on HS GABA release. Repetitive stimulation of HS 
fibers increased spontaneous GABA release in the MS/DBB, revealing that HS 
projections can modulate local GABAergic tone. These results show that HS GABA 
release has far-reaching impacts on overall levels of inhibition in the MS/DBB 
and is under regulatory control by cholinergic and GABAergic activity. This 
bidirectional modulation of GABA release from local and HS projections in the 
MS/DBB will likely have profound impact not only on activity within the MS/DBB, 
but also on output to the hippocampus and hippocampal-dependent learning and 
memory.
