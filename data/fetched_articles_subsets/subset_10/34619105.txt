Up to 50% of the people who have died from COVID-19 had metabolic and vascular 
disorders. Notably, there are many direct links between COVID-19 and the 
metabolic and endocrine systems. Thus, not only are patients with metabolic 
dysfunction (eg, obesity, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and 
diabetes) at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 but also infection 
with SARS-CoV-2 might lead to new-onset diabetes or aggravation of pre-existing 
metabolic disorders. In this Review, we provide an update on the mechanisms of 
how metabolic and endocrine disorders might predispose patients to develop 
severe COVID-19. Additionally, we update the practical recommendations and 
management of patients with COVID-19 and post-pandemic. Furthermore, we 
summarise new treatment options for patients with both COVID-19 and diabetes, 
and highlight current challenges in clinical management.
