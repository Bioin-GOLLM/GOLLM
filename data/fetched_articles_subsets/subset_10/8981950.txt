Hereditary multiple exostoses (EXT) is an autosomal dominant disorder 
characterized by the formation of cartilage-capped prominences that develop from 
the growth centers of the long bones. EXT is genetically heterogeneous, with 
three loci, currently identified on chromosomes 8q24.1, 11p13, and 19q. The EXT1 
gene, located on chromosome 8q24.1, has been cloned and is encoded by a 3.4-kb 
cDNA. Five mutations in the EXT1 gene have been identified--four germ-line 
mutations, including two unrelated families with the same mutation, and one 
somatic mutation in a patient with chondrosarcoma. Four of the mutations 
identified resulted in frameshifts and premature termination codons, while the 
fifth mutation resulted in a substitution of leucine for arginine. Loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of chondrosarcomas and chondroblastomas revealed 
multiple LOH events at loci on chromosomes 3q, 8q, 10q, and 19q. One sporadic 
chondrosarcoma demonstrated LOH for EXT1 and EXT3, while a second underwent LOH 
for EXT2 and chromosome 10. A third chondrosarcoma underwent LOH for EXT1 and 
chromosome 3q. These results agree with previous findings that mutations at EXT1 
and multiple genetic events that include LOH at other loci may be required for 
the development of chondrosarcoma.
