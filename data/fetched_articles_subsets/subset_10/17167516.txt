Cancer phenomics, the systematic acquisition and objective documentation of host 
and/or somatic cancer phenotypic data at many levels, is a young field compared 
with other molecular-based 'omics'. Two relatively advanced phenomic paradigms 
are associated with phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and rearranged 
during transfection (RET), genes that are associated with cancer predisposition 
syndromes in addition to developmental disorders. The phenomic characterization 
of PTEN and RET underscores the importance of incorporating robust phenomics 
into the host 'omic' profile, and shows that the evolution of phenomics will be 
crucial to the advancement of personalized medicine.
