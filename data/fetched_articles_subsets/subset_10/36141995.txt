The purpose of this study was to explore the occupational performance and needs 
of patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv). A semi-structured 
interview was conducted by an occupational therapist with 44 patients with 
Val50Met-ATTRv recruited through patient associations. The interview addressed 
three related dimensions. The first one, the physical dimension, was evaluated 
using the Spanish versions of the Barthel Index, the Lawton and Brody scale, and 
the Norfolk questionnaire; the second one, the psychological dimension, was 
assessed with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale and the SF-36 
questionnaire; and the third dimension, the occupational performance, was 
assessed through unstructured questions on daily occupations, work, roles, and 
hobbies given the lack of standardized scales. Twenty participants (45.4%) 
responded that the disease had affected their basic activities of daily living, 
twenty- four (54.5%) perceived an impact on their instrumental activities of 
daily living, and all the participants reported that the disease symptoms had 
affected their ability to perform advanced activities as well as their 
employment status. Only three patients (6.8%) reported a lack of psychological 
impairment following disease diagnosis. These findings suggest that a 
semi-structured interview conducted by an occupational therapist can provide 
essential information that should be considered for the implementation of 
occupational therapy programs targeting patients living with a diagnosis of 
ATTRv.
