Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing proteins play important 
roles in defense against pathogens in both animals and plants, connecting the 
immunity signaling pathways via a chain of specific protein-protein 
interactions. Among them is SARM, the only TIR domain-containing adaptor that 
can negatively regulate TLR signaling. By extensive phylogenetic analysis, we 
show here that SARM is closely related to bacterial proteins with TIR domains, 
suggesting that this family has a different evolutionary history from other 
animal TIR-containing adaptors, possibly emerging via a lateral gene transfer 
from bacteria to animals. We also show evidence of several similar, independent 
transfer events, none of which, however, survived in vertebrates. An 
evolutionary relationship between the animal SARM adaptor and bacterial proteins 
with TIR domains illustrates the possible role that bacterial TIR-containing 
proteins play in regulating eukaryotic immune responses and how this mechanism 
was possibly adapted by the eukaryotes themselves.
