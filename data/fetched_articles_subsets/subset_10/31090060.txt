OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening complication of pregnancy 
that accounts for 12% of all maternal deaths worldwide. The aim of this study is 
to investigate the relationships between the polymorphisms of angiotensinogen 
(AGT) gene and preeclampsia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, 240 unrelated preeclampsia patients and 178 
normotensive women were examined. Genomic DNA was extracted then we assessed 
M235T(C/T) and A-6G polymorphisms of the AGT gene. Genotyping of M235T and A-6G 
polymorphisms were performed using SSP-PCR and MS-PCR, respectively.
RESULTS: A significant protective association was observed between A-6G G 
allele, A-6G A/G heterozygote genotype (OR = 0.6, p = 0.007 and OR = 0.6, 
p = 0.04) against PE. Furthermore, it was shown that two copies of A-6G A allele 
would increase PE risk (OR: 0.62, p = 0.04). Our results did not show a 
significant association for M235T polymorphism and PE. However, the combinations 
of A-6G A/A genotype and M235T T/C genotype (OR = 0.4, p = 0.02) and also A-6G 
A/G genotype and M235T T/C genotype (OR = 0.5, p = 0.04) in controls represented 
a significant protective association against PE.
CONCLUSION: According to the existence of significant correlation between two 
candidate polymorphisms, A-6G and M235T polymorphisms, with PE disease in our 
study, they may be considered as valuable factors in susceptibility to PE 
disease in Iranian women.
