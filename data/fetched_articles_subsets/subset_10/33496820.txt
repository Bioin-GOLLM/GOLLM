Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the key regulators of oxygen homeostasis in 
response to hypoxia. In diabetes, multiple tissues are hypoxic but adaptive 
responses to hypoxia are impaired due to insufficient activation of HIF 
signalling, which results from inhibition of HIF-1Î± stability and function due 
to hyperglycaemia and elevated fatty acid levels. In this review, we will 
summarise and discuss current findings about the regulation of HIF signalling in 
diabetes and the pathogenic roles of hypoxia and dysregulated HIF signalling in 
the development of diabetes and its complications. The therapeutic potential of 
targeting HIF signalling for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and 
related complications is also discussed.
