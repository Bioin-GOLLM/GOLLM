Deregulation of RAS signaling in Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results in the 
development of multiple neurofibromas, complex tumor of the peripheral nerves 
with no effective medical treatment. There is increasing evidences that 
neurofibroma initiates through loss of NF1 function in the Schwann cell lineage, 
followed by a cascade of interactions with other cell types in the surrounding 
tumor microenvironment. In NF1 patients, neurofibromas always develop along 
peripheral nerves and do not migrate to distant organs, including the central 
nervous system. In this study, we sought to identify the contributions of these 
peripheral nerves in neurofibroma formation. Using in vivo and in vitro 
three-dimensional (3D) culturing system, we show that peripheral nerves are 
absolutely required for neurofibroma tumorigenesis and report a novel 3D skin 
raft culture system for neurofibroma formation in vitro to decipher tumor 
pathogenesis. This interaction between neoplastic Schwann cells and their 
surrounding neural microenvironment has important implications for understanding 
early cellular events that dictate tumorigenesis. It also provides fertile 
ground for the elucidation of intrinsic and extrinsic factors within the nerve 
microenvironment that likely play essential roles in neurofibroma development 
and, therefore, viable therapeutic targets in neurofibroma therapy.
