Carbapenem non-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (CNSAB) is an important 
pathogen that causes nosocomial bacteremia among critically ill patients 
worldwide. The magnitude of antibiotic resistance of A. baumanii in Indonesia is 
expected to be significant; however, the data available are limited. The aim of 
this study was to analyze the genetic profiles of CNSAB isolates from patients 
with bacteremia in Indonesia. CNSAB isolates from blood cultures of bacteremia 
patients in 12 hospitals in Indonesia were included. The blood cultures were 
conducted using the BacT/Alert or BACTEC automated system. The CNSAB were 
identified with either Vitek 2 system or Phoenix platform followed by a 
confirmation test using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, 
targeting the specific gyrB gene. The carbapenemase genes were detected by 
multiplex PCR. In total, 110 CNSAB isolates were collected and were mostly 
resistant to nearly all antibiotic classes. The majority of CNSAB isolates were 
susceptible to tigecycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), 45.5% 
and 38.2%, respectively. The blaOXA-51-like gene was identified in all CNSAB 
isolates. Out of the total, 83.6% of CNSAB isolates had blaOXA-23-like gene, 
37.3% blaOXA-24-like gene, 4.5% blaNDM-1 gene, 0.9% blaIMP-1 gene, and 0.9% 
blaVIM gene. No blaOXA-48-like gene was identified. The blaOXA-23-like gene was 
the predominant gene in all except two hospitals. The presence of the 
blaOXA-24-like gene was associated with resistance to tigecycline, amikacin, 
TMP-SMX and cefoperazone-sulbactam, while blaOXA-23-like gene was associated 
with resistance to TMP-SMX and cefoperazone-sulbactam. In conclusion, the 
blaOXA-23-like gene was the predominant gene among CNSAB isolates throughout 
Indonesia. A continuous national surveillance system needs to be established to 
further monitor the genetic profiles of CNSAB in Indonesia.
