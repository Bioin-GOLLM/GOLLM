Muenke syndrome is a nonsyndromic coronal craniosynostosis, characterised by 
clinical and radiological variability, with occurrence of both familial and 
sporadic cases. Pro250Arg (P250R) is a pathogenic mutation, causing this highly 
clinically heterogeneous syndrome reported worldwide irrespective of race and 
ethnicity. The authors describe three Indian cases in two different families 
showing phenotypic spectrum of the disease, which was later confirmed by genetic 
testing.
