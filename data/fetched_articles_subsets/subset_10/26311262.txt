PURPOSE: To describe a series of patients with Stargardt disease (STGD1) 
exhibiting a phenotype usually associated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 
retinopathy on spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).
METHODS: Observational case series from Columbia University Medical Center 
involving eight patients with genetically-confirmed STGD1. Patients selected for 
the study presented no history of HCQ use. Horizontal macular SD-OCT scans and 
accompanying 488-nm autofluorescence (AF) images, color fundus photographs, and 
full-field electroretinograms were analyzed.
RESULTS: All study patients exhibited an abrupt thinning of the parafoveal 
region or disruption of the outer retinal layers on SD-OCT resembling the 
transient HCQ retinopathy phenotype. Funduscopy and AF imaging revealed 
variations of bull's eye maculopathy (BEM). Five patients exhibited local 
fleck-like deposits around the lesion. Genetic screening confirmed two 
disease-causing ABCA4 mutations in five patients and one mutation in three 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: A transient SD-OCT phenotype ascribed to patients with HCQ 
retinopathy is associated with an early subtype of STGD1. This finding may also 
present with HCQ retinopathy-like BEM lesions on AF imaging and funduscopy. A 
possible phenotypic overlap is unsurprising, given certain shared mechanistic 
disease processes between the two conditions. A thorough work-up, including 
screening of genes that are causal in retinal dystrophies associated with foveal 
sparing, may prevent misdiagnosis of more ambiguous cases.
