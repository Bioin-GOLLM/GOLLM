Amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease. The link 
between structure, assembly and neuronal toxicity of this peptide is of major 
current interest but still poorly defined. Here, we explored this relationship 
by rationally designing a variant form of Aβ1-42 (vAβ1-42) differing in only two 
amino acids. Unlike Aβ1-42, we found that the variant does not self-assemble, 
nor is it toxic to neuronal cells. Moreover, while Aβ1-42 oligomers impact on 
synaptic function, vAβ1-42 does not. In a living animal model system we 
demonstrate that only Aβ1-42 leads to memory deficits. Our findings underline a 
key role for peptide sequence in the ability to assemble and form toxic 
structures. Furthermore, our non-toxic variant satisfies an unmet demand for a 
closely related control peptide for Aβ1-42 cellular studies of disease 
pathology, offering a new opportunity to decipher the mechanisms that accompany 
Aβ1-42-induced toxicity leading to neurodegeneration.
