Intrinsic and acquired resistance of metastatic melanoma to (V600E/K)BRAF and/or 
MEK inhibitors, which is often caused by activation of the PI3K/AKT survival 
pathway, represents a major clinical challenge. Given that p53 is capable of 
antagonising PI3K/AKT activation we hypothesised that pharmacological 
restoration of p53 activity may increase the sensitivity of BRAF-mutant melanoma 
to MAPK-targeted therapy and eventually delay and/or prevent acquisition of drug 
resistance. To test this possibility we exposed a panel of vemurafenib-sensitive 
and resistant (innate and acquired) (V600E/K)BRAF melanomas to a (V600E/K)BRAF 
inhibitor (vemurafenib) alone or in combination with a direct p53 activator 
(PRIMA-1(Met)/APR-246). Strikingly, PRIMA-1(Met) synergised with vemurafenib to 
induce apoptosis and suppress proliferation of (V600E/K)BRAF melanoma cells in 
vitro and to inhibit tumour growth in vivo. Importantly, this drug combination 
decreased the viability of both vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant melanoma 
cells irrespectively of the TP53 status. Notably, p53 reactivation was 
invariably accompanied by PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition, the activity of which was 
found as a dominant resistance mechanism to BRAF inhibition in our lines. From 
all various combinatorial modalities tested, targeting the MAPK and PI3K 
signalling pathways through p53 reactivation or not, the 
PRIMA-1(Met)/vemurafenib combination was the most cytotoxic. We conclude that 
PRIMA-1(Met) through its ability to directly reactivate p53 regardless of the 
mechanism causing its deactivation, and thereby dampen PI3K signalling, 
sensitises (V600E/K)BRAF-positive melanoma to BRAF inhibitors.
