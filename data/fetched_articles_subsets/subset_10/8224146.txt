The structure of mutant bacteriorhodopsin (bR), D85N, was examined by CD and 
X-ray diffraction at pH 7. The absorption maximum of D85N at pH 7 is located at 
605 nm, which is similar to the acid-blue form of wild-type bR. D85N shows a 
monophasic CD band, the maximum of which is at 575 nm, although the crystalline 
arrangement and the trimeric structure is maintained. The acid-blue form of 
wild-type bR shows a biphasic CD despite the similarity in absorption spectra.
