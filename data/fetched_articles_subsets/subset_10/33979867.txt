INTRODUCTION: Despite the ethnic differences in 5-HTTLPR (S allele relates to 
better antidepressant response in Korean and Japanese people, while L allele 
with better response in Caucasians), it is unclear whether 5-HTTLPR and its high 
expression locus rs25531 are interactively associated with antidepressant 
treatment outcome. We investigated the individual and interaction effects of 
these polymorphisms on antidepressant treatment outcomes in the Korean 
population.
METHODS: A total of 464 Korean subjects with major depressive disorder completed 
6 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy. Venous blood was extracted for genotyping 
5-HTTLPR and rs25531 by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. We used 
logistic regression analyses to verify the main and interaction effects of 
5-HTTLPR and rs25531 on response and remission after antidepressant treatment.
RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, the SS genotype of 5-HTTLPR was 
significantly associated with better treatment outcomes (p<0.001, odds ratio 
[OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]=2.435 [1.551, 3.823] in response; p<0.001, 
OR [95% CI]=2.912 [1.730, 4.903] in remission), while G-containing genotype 
(AG+GG) of rs25531 was only associated with remission (p=0.034, OR [95% 
CI]=2.104 [1.058, 4.181]). The interaction effect of 5-HTTLPR and rs25531 on 
response and remission was insignificant (all p>0.05).
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest variations in allelic frequency and 
functionality of 5-HTTLPR and rs25531 among the different ethnicities. We found 
a minor advantage of rs25531 in achieving remission. However, there was no 
interaction effect with 5-HTTLPR.
