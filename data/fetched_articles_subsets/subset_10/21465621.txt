Canonical and non-canonical wnt signals often have opposed roles. In this 
report, we use developing Xenopus embryos to demonstrate a novel 
anti-proliferative role for non-canonical wnt signals in the very earliest 
stages of kidney development. Non-canonical wnt signals were down-regulated 
using PDZ domain mutants of dishevelled 2 and up-regulated using wild-type 
vang-like 2, while canonical signals were manipulated using dominant-negative 
forms of lef1 or treatment with lithium. When non-canonical signals are 
down-regulated in the developing Xenopus pronephros, cell proliferation rates 
increased and when canonical signals were shutdown the opposite occurred. 
Treatment with lithium chloride has a powerful pro-proliferative effect on the 
forming nephric primordium. Together these data show that in addition to 
previously documented antagonisms between these distinct wnt signaling pathways, 
they also have opposing effects on cell division.
