BACKGROUND: Mutations in the retina-specific ABC transporter (ABCA4) gene are 
associated with different types of macular degeneration, including Stargardt 
disease, cone-rod dystrophy, Fundus flavimaculatus, Retinitis pigmentosa and 
probably age-related macular degeneration.
METHODS: Screening for mutations in the ABCA4 gene was performed using 
denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing.
RESULTS: We describe the identification of a new de novo 44-bp deletion in an 
Italian patient affected by cone-rod dystrophy. The mutation, located in intron 
48 of the ABCA4 gene, is predicted to cause exon 49 skipping, resulting in loss 
of the C-terminus of the ABCA4 protein. Interestingly, exon 49 also codes for a 
highly conserved VFVNFA motif, which has been demonstrated to be essential for 
the activity of ABCA1, another gene of the ABC transporter family. The presence 
of CT repeats at the breakpoints might have facilitated the generation of the 
deletion through a slippage mispairing mechanism.
CONCLUSIONS: The new 6730-16del44 deletion is the first de novo mutation 
associated with cone-rod dystrophy and may contribute to a better understanding 
of the role of ABCA4 mutations in macular dystrophies.
