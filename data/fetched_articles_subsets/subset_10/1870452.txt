The ultrastructural localization of osteopontin in bone was determined 
especially focussing on the relationship to bone forming cells, i.e. osteoblasts 
and osteocytes. Thus, rat metaphyseal and cortical bone was fixed in a mixture 
of low concentration glutar- and paraformaldehyde and embedded at low 
temperature in Lowicryl K11M. Polyclonal antibodies raised against rat 
osteopontin fusion protein were incubated on ultrathin sections and protein G 
coated with 5-nm colloidal gold was used for detection. The results demonstrate 
most intensive labeling in the mineralization front of newly formed bone; 
whereas lower concentration of label was found in the osteoid both in 
metaphyseal and cortical bone. The concentration of marker was substantially 
higher in newly formed bone near osteoblasts compared to bone constituting the 
osteocyte lacuna. Intracellularly the prevailing localization of label was to 
large Golgi vesicles in osteoblasts. Only focally local accumulation of marker 
was seen at the cell/osteoid surface. The observations suggest a function of 
osteopontin also in the mineral turnover of newly formed bone.
