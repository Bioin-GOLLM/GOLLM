Muscarinic M1-M5 acetylcholine receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that 
regulate many vital functions of the central and peripheral nervous systems. In 
particular, the M1 and M4 receptor subtypes have emerged as attractive drug 
targets for treatments of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease 
and schizophrenia, but the high conservation of the acetylcholine-binding pocket 
has spurred current research into targeting allosteric sites on these receptors. 
Here we report the crystal structures of the M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors 
bound to the inverse agonist, tiotropium. Comparison of these structures with 
each other, as well as with the previously reported M2 and M3 receptor 
structures, reveals differences in the orthosteric and allosteric binding sites 
that contribute to a role in drug selectivity at this important receptor family. 
We also report identification of a cluster of residues that form a network 
linking the orthosteric and allosteric sites of the M4 receptor, which provides 
new insight into how allosteric modulation may be transmitted between the two 
spatially distinct domains.
