Characteristic or classic phenotype of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is 
associated with a recognisable facial pattern. However, the heterogeneity in 
causal genes and the presence of overlapping syndromes have made it increasingly 
difficult to diagnose only by clinical features. DeepGestalt technology, and its 
app Face2Gene, is having a growing impact on the diagnosis and management of 
genetic diseases by analysing the features of affected individuals. Here, we 
performed a phenotypic study on a cohort of 49 individuals harbouring causative 
variants in known CdLS genes in order to evaluate Face2Gene utility and 
sensitivity in the clinical diagnosis of CdLS. Based on the profile images of 
patients, a diagnosis of CdLS was within the top five predicted syndromes for 
97.9% of our cases and even listed as first prediction for 83.7%. The age of 
patients did not seem to affect the prediction accuracy, whereas our results 
indicate a correlation between the clinical score and affected genes. 
Furthermore, each gene presents a different pattern recognition that may be used 
to develop new neural networks with the goal of separating different genetic 
subtypes in CdLS. Overall, we conclude that computer-assisted image analysis 
based on deep learning could support the clinical diagnosis of CdLS.
