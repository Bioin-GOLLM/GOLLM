Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a sporadic, autosomal dominant 
disorder characterized by premature and accelerated aging symptoms leading to 
death at the mean age of 14.6 years usually due to cardiovascular complications. 
HGPS is caused by a de novo point mutation in the LMNA gene encoding the 
intermediate filament proteins lamins A and C which are structural components of 
the nuclear lamina. This mutation leads to the production of a truncated toxic 
form of lamin A, issued from aberrant splicing and called progerin. Progerin 
accumulates in HGPS cells' nuclei and is a hallmark of the disease. Small 
amounts of progerin are also produced during normal aging. HGPS cells and animal 
preclinical models have provided insights into the molecular and cellular 
pathways that underlie the disease and have also highlighted possible mechanisms 
involved in normal aging. This review reports recent medical advances and 
treatment approaches for patients affected with HGPS.
