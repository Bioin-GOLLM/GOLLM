The prefrontal cortex (PFC) dopamine system, which is critical for modulating 
PFC function, undergoes remodeling until at least young adulthood in primates. 
Catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) alters extracellular dopamine levels in PFC, 
and its gene contains a functional polymorphism (Val(158)Met) that has been 
associated with variation in PFC function. We examined COMT enzyme activity and 
protein immunoreactivity in the PFC during human postnatal development. Protein 
was extracted from PFC of normal individuals from 6 age groups: neonates (1-4 
months), infants (5-11 months), teens (14-18 years), young adults (20-24 years), 
adults (31-43 years), and aged individuals (68-86 years; n = 5-8 per group). 
There was a significant 2-fold increase in COMT enzyme activity from neonate to 
adulthood, paralleled by increases in COMT protein immunoreactivity. 
Furthermore, COMT protein immunoreactivity was related to Val(158)Met genotype, 
as has been previously demonstrated. The significant increase in COMT activity 
from neonate to adulthood complements previous findings of protracted postnatal 
changes in the PFC dopamine system and may reflect an increasing importance of 
COMT for PFC dopamine regulation during maturation.
