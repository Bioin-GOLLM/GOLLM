A peptidic CXCR4 antagonist T140 efficiently blocks the entry of T cell 
line-tropic strains of HIV-1 (X4-HIV-1) into target cells. In this study, a 
series of T140 derivatives, replacing the basic amino acid residues with Glu 
(D-Glu) and/or L-citrulline (Cit), were synthesized in order to reduce 
non-specific binding and cytotoxicity. Among them, TE14011 ([Cit6, D-Glu8]-T140 
with the C-terminal amide) exhibited strong anti-HIV activity and low 
cytotoxicity. TE14011 was found to be stable in mouse serum, but unstable in rat 
liver homogenate due to the deletion of the N-terminal 
Arg1-Arg2-L-3-(2-naphthyl)alanine (Nal)3 residues from the parent peptide. 
N-Terminal acetylation of TE14011 led to the development of a novel lead 
compound, Ac-TE 14011, which possesses a high selectivity index as well as 
increased stability in serum and liver homogenate.
