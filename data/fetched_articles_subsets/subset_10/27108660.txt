BACKGROUND: Current understanding of adrenal steroidogenesis is that the 
production of aldosterone or cortisol depends on the expression of aldosterone 
synthase (CYP11B2) and 11β-hydroxylase cytochrome P450 (CYP11B1), respectively. 
However, this has never been studied in dogs, and in some species, a single 
CYP11B catalyzes both cortisol and aldosterone formation. Analysis of the canine 
genome provides data of a single CYP11B gene which is called CYP11B2, and a 
large sequence gap exists near the so-called CYP11B2 gene.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the zonal expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the 
canine adrenal cortex and to determine whether dogs have 1 or multiple CYP11B 
genes.
ANIMALS: Normal adrenal glands from 10 healthy dogs.
METHODS: Zona fasciculata (zF) and zona glomerulosa (zG) tissue was isolated by 
laser microdissection. The mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes and their 
major regulators was studied with RT-qPCR. Southern blot was performed 
to determine whether the sequence gap contains a CYP11B gene copy. 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase 
(CYP17).
RESULTS: Equal expression (P = .62) of the so-called CYP11B2 gene was found in 
the zG and zF. Southern blot revealed a single gene. CYP17 expression (P = .05) 
was significantly higher in the zF compared with the zG, which was confirmed 
with IHC.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We conclude that there is only 1 CYP11B 
gene in canine adrenals. The zone-specific production of aldosterone and 
cortisol is probably due to zone-specific CYP17 expression, which makes it an 
attractive target for selective inhibition of cortisol synthesis without 
affecting mineralocorticoid production in the zG.
