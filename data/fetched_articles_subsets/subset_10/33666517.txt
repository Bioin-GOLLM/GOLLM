Aim: The present study observed the relationship between the 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genotypes and clinical outcome in children 
with sickle cell disorder. Methodology: A total of 249 children were recruited 
for the study and evaluated clinically for calculating severity score, 
homocysteine levels and C677T and A1298C genotyping. Results: The frequencies of 
variant genotypes were 28.1% CT/TT677 and 69.1% AC/CC1298. Plasma homocysteine 
was significantly elevated in variant groups (p < 0.001). Both the genotypes 
accorded significant association with homocysteinemia (p < 0.001). Vascular 
crisis (p = 0.04), frequency of hospitalization (p < 0.001) and severity score 
(p = 0.02) revealed association with C677T and not with A1298C. The CT/TT677 
genotypes showed 3.39-times (p = 0.032) increase in a higher score for severity. 
Conclusion: C677T depicted significant association with clinical severity in 
study population.
