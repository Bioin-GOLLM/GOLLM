BACKGROUND: Intellectual developmental disorders (IDD) generally refers to the 
persistent impairment of cognitive activities and mental retardation caused by 
physical damage to the brain or incomplete brain development. We aimed to 
explore its genetic causes.
METHODS: In this study, 21 IDD patients were recruited. The Gesell developmental 
scales (GDS) and Wechsler intelligence scale for children (WISC) were used to 
assess the impaired level of intellectual development for all probands. A 
superconducting MRI scanner (Philips AcsNT 3.0 T Philips, Best, The Netherlands) 
was used to perform a plain MRI scan of the skull on the probands. The 
whole-exome sequencing was carried out using next-generation sequencing in all 
probands and their families.
RESULTS: Eight had seizures and four had typical characteristics of autism. 
Pregnancy and delivery were uneventful except for three patients. Moderate IDD 
(52.4%) accounted for the majority. The abnormal MRI results included 
ventriculomegaly, pachygyria, broadening external cerebral space, abnormal 
signal change and agenesis of corpus callosum. Eleven variants were identified, 
including the variant in CREBBP, MECP2, HCFC1, ATRX, RAB39B, CLCN4, DYRK1A and 
CASKgenes. The function areas result of gene-positive group were compared to 
that of gene-negative group. Not significant (p>0.05) items were revealed after 
this analysis.
CONCLUSION: Eleven variants were identified, including the variant in CREBBP, 
MECP2, HCFC1, ATRX, RAB39B, CLCN4, DYRK1A and CASK genes. The function areas 
result of gene-positive group were not significantly different from the 
gene-negative group.
