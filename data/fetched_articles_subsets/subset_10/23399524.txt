We report the clinical case of a 43year old Italian woman and her family with 
Polycystic Lipomembranous Osteodysplasia with Sclerosing Leukoencephalopathy 
(PLOSL), also known as Nasu-Hakola disease. PLOSL is a unique disease clinically 
characterized by a progressive presenile frontal-lobe dementia and multiple 
cystic bone lesions, typically leading to fractures of the limbs in the third 
decade of life. This rare recessively inherited disease is caused by mutations 
in one of two genes encoding different subunits of a receptor signalling 
complex, TYROBP and TREM2. In the present case fractures after microtrauma were 
not diagnosed, despite a radiological demonstration of the characteristic bone 
lesions in PLOSL. Further investigation led to the same diagnosis in her 
brother, with similar clinical presentation and the same mutation. Therefore a 
diagnosis of PLOSL should be considered in cases of presenile frontal-lobe 
dementia, even if the hallmark of pathological fractures is absent.
