The title compound, [Ag(C(18)H(27)P)(2)]NO(3), is a mononuclear salt species in 
which the Ag atom is coordinated by two phosphine ligands, forming a cation, 
with the nitrate as the counter-anion, weakly inter-acting with the Ag atom, 
resulting in Ag⋯O distances of 2.602 (6) and 2.679 (6) Å. The cationic 
silver-phosphine complex has a non-linear geometry in which the P-Ag-P angle is 
154.662 (19)°. The Ag-P bond lengths are 2.4303 (6) and 2.4046 (5) Å.
