AIMS: The dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) phenotype is the result of combined 
genetic and acquired triggers. Until now, clinical decision-making in DCM has 
mainly been based on ejection fraction (EF) and NYHA classification, not 
considering the DCM heterogenicity. The present study aimed to identify patient 
subgroups by phenotypic clustering integrating aetiologies, comorbidities, and 
cardiac function along cardiac transcript levels, to unveil pathophysiological 
differences between DCM subgroups.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 795 consecutive DCM patients from the 
Maastricht Cardiomyopathy Registry who underwent in-depth phenotyping, 
comprising extensive clinical data on aetiology and comorbodities, imaging and 
endomyocardial biopsies. Four mutually exclusive and clinically distinct 
phenogroups (PG) were identified based upon unsupervised hierarchical clustering 
of principal components: [PG1] mild systolic dysfunction, [PG2] auto-immune, 
[PG3] genetic and arrhythmias, and [PG4] severe systolic dysfunction. 
RNA-sequencing of cardiac samples (n = 91) revealed a distinct underlying 
molecular profile per PG: pro-inflammatory (PG2, auto-immune), pro-fibrotic 
(PG3; arrhythmia), and metabolic (PG4, low EF) gene expression. Furthermore, 
event-free survival differed among the four phenogroups, also when corrected for 
well-known clinical predictors. Decision tree modelling identified four clinical 
parameters (auto-immune disease, EF, atrial fibrillation, and kidney function) 
by which every DCM patient from two independent DCM cohorts could be placed in 
one of the four phenogroups with corresponding outcome (n = 789; Spain, n = 352 
and Italy, n = 437), showing a feasible applicability of the phenogrouping.
CONCLUSION: The present study identified four different DCM phenogroups 
associated with significant differences in clinical presentation, underlying 
molecular profiles and outcome, paving the way for a more personalized treatment 
approach.
