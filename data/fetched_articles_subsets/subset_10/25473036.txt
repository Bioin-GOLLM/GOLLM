Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) affect more than 3% of children and are 
attributable to single-gene mutations at more than 1000 loci. Traditional 
methods yield molecular diagnoses in less than one-half of children with NDD. 
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) can enable 
diagnosis of NDD, but their clinical and cost-effectiveness are unknown. One 
hundred families with 119 children affected by NDD received diagnostic WGS 
and/or WES of parent-child trios, wherein the sequencing approach was guided by 
acuity of illness. Forty-five percent received molecular diagnoses. An 
accelerated sequencing modality, rapid WGS, yielded diagnoses in 73% of families 
with acutely ill children (11 of 15). Forty percent of families with children 
with nonacute NDD, followed in ambulatory care clinics (34 of 85), received 
diagnoses: 33 by WES and 1 by staged WES then WGS. The cost of prior negative 
tests in the nonacute patients was $19,100 per family, suggesting sequencing to 
be cost-effective at up to $7640 per family. A change in clinical care or 
impression of the pathophysiology was reported in 49% of newly diagnosed 
families. If WES or WGS had been performed at symptom onset, genomic diagnoses 
may have been made 77 months earlier than occurred in this study. It is 
suggested that initial diagnostic evaluation of children with NDD should include 
trio WGS or WES, with extension of accelerated sequencing modalities to 
high-acuity patients.
