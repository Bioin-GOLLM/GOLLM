The Na+/I- symporter (NIS) is a key plasma membrane glycoprotein that mediates 
Na+-dependent active I- transport in the thyroid, lactating breast, and other 
tissues. The OH group of the side chain at position 354 in transmembrane segment 
(TMS) IX of NIS has been demonstrated to be essential for NIS function, as 
revealed by the study of the congenital I- transport defect-causing T354P NIS 
mutation. TMS IX has the most beta-OH group-containing amino acids (Ser and Thr) 
of any TMS in NIS. We have thoroughly characterized the functional significance 
of all Ser and Thr in TMS IX in NIS, as well as of other residues in TMS IX that 
are highly conserved in other transporters of the SLC5A protein family. Here we 
show that five beta-OH group-containing residues (Thr-351, Ser-353, Thr-354, 
Ser-356, and Thr-357) and Asn-360, all of which putatively face the same side of 
the helix in TMS IX, plus Asp-369, located in the membrane/cytosol interface, 
play key roles in NIS function and seem to be involved in Na+ 
binding/translocation.
