RNAi factors and their catalytic activities are essential for heterochromatin 
assembly in S. pombe. This has led to the idea that siRNAs can promote H3K9 
methylation by recruiting the cryptic loci regulator complex (CLRC), also known 
as recombination in K complex (RIKC), to the nucleation site. The conserved 
RNA-binding protein Rct1 (AtCyp59/SIG-7) interacts with splicing factors and RNA 
polymerase II. Here we show that Rct1 promotes processing of pericentromeric 
transcripts into siRNAs via the RNA recognition motif. Surprisingly, loss of 
siRNA in rct1 mutants has no effect on H3K9 di- or tri-methylation, resembling 
other splicing mutants, suggesting that post-transcriptional gene silencing per 
se is not required to maintain heterochromatin. Splicing of the Argonaute gene 
is also defective in rct1 mutants and contributes to loss of silencing but not 
to loss of siRNA. Our results suggest that Rct1 guides transcripts to the RNAi 
machinery by promoting splicing of elongating non-coding transcripts.
