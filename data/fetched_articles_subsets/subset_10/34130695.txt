Gestational trophoblastic tumors seriously endanger child productive needs and 
the health of women in childbearing age. Nanodrug-based therapy mediated by 
transporters provides a novel strategy for the treatment of trophoblastic 
tumors. Focusing on the overexpression of human equilibrative nucleoside 
transporter 1 (ENT1) on the membrane of choriocarcinoma cells (JEG-3), 
cytarabine (Cy, a substrate of ENT1)-grafted liposomes (Cy-Lipo) were introduced 
for the targeted delivery of methotrexate (Cy-Lipo@MTX) for choriocarcinoma 
therapy in this study. ENT1 has a high affinity for Cy-Lipo and can mediate the 
endocytosis of the designed nanovehicles into JEG-3 cells. The ENT1 protein 
maintains its transportation function through circulation and regeneration 
during endocytosis. Therefore, Cy-Lipo-based formulations showed high tumor 
accumulation and retention in biodistribution studies. More importantly, the 
designed DSPE-PEG2k-Cy conjugation exhibited a synergistic therapeutic effect on 
choriocarcinoma. Finally, Cy-Lipo@MTX exerted an extremely powerful 
anti-choriocarcinoma effect with fewer side effects. This study suggests that 
the overexpressed ENT1 on choriocarcinoma cells holds great potential as a 
high-efficiency target for the rational design of active targeting 
nanotherapeutics.
