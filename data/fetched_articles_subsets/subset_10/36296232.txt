Sheeppox (SPP), goatpox (GTP), and lumpy skin disease (LSD) are economically 
significant pox diseases of ruminants, caused by sheeppox virus (SPPV), goatpox 
virus (GTPV), and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), respectively. SPPV and GTPV 
can infect both sheep and goats, while LSDV mainly affects cattle. The recent 
emergence of LSD in Asia and Europe and the repeated incursions of SPP in 
Greece, Bulgaria, and Russia highlight how these diseases can spread outside 
their endemic regions, stressing the urgent need to develop high-throughput 
serological surveillance tools. We expressed and tested two recombinant 
truncated proteins, the capripoxvirus homologs of the vaccinia virus C-type 
lectin-like protein A34 and the EEV glycoprotein A36, as antigens for an 
indirect ELISA (iELISA) to detect anti-capripoxvirus antibodies. Since A34 
outperformed A36 by showing no cross-reactivity to anti-parapoxvirus antibodies, 
we optimized an A34 iELISA using two different working conditions, one for LSD 
in cattle and one for SPP/GTP in sheep and goats. Both displayed sound 
sensitivities and specificities: 98.81% and 98.72%, respectively, for the LSD 
iELISA, and 97.68% and 95.35%, respectively, for the SPP/GTP iELISA, and did not 
cross-react with anti-parapoxvirus antibodies of cattle, sheep, and goats. These 
assays could facilitate the implementation of capripox control programs through 
serosurveillance and the screening of animals for trade.
