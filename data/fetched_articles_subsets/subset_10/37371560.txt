Synucleins are a family of small, soluble proteins mainly expressed in neural 
tissue and in certain tumors. Since their discovery, tens of thousands of 
scientific reports have been published about this family of proteins as they are 
associated with severe human diseases. Although the physiological function of 
these proteins is still elusive, their relationship with neurodegeneration and 
cancer has been clearly described over the years. In this review, we summarize 
data connecting synucleins and cancer, going from the structural description of 
these molecules to their involvement in tumor-related processes, and discuss the 
putative use of these proteins as cancer molecular biomarkers.
