In Sweden, human cases of tularemia caused by Francisella tularensis holarctica 
are assumed to be transmitted by mosquitoes, but how mosquito vectors acquire 
and transmit the bacterium is not clear. To determine how transmission of this 
bacterium occurs, mosquito larvae were collected in an area where tularemia is 
endemic, brought to the laboratory, and reared to adults in their original pond 
water. Screening of adult mosquitoes by real-time PCR demonstrated F. tularensis 
lpnA sequences in 14 of the 48 mosquito pools tested; lpnA sequences were 
demonstrated in 6 of 9 identified mosquito species. Further analysis confirmed 
the presence of F. tularensis holarctica-specific 30-bp deletion region 
sequences (FtM19inDel) in water from breeding containers and in 3 mosquito 
species (Aedes sticticus, Ae. vexans, and Ae. punctor) known to take blood from 
humans. Our results suggest that the mosquitoes that transmit F. tularensis 
holarctica during tularemia outbreaks acquire the bacterium already as larvae.
