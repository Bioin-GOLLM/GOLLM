Although hypercoagulable states are most often associated with venous 
thromboses, arterial thromboses are reported in protein C, protein S, 
antithrombin deficient patients and in those with factor V Leiden, components of 
hereditary thrombophilia. Because these arterial thromboses (peripheral artery 
disease, myocardial infarction, and cerebral infarction) mostly affect young 
persons, aged below 45 years, it is important to test and treat these 
thrombophilic defects. Because the relation thrombophilia--arterial thromboses 
is still under debate, due to conflicting data, this article is a review of 
studies published in literature regarding the implication of the above-mentioned 
thrombophilic defects in cerebral infarcts.
