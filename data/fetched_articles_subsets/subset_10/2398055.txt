Arg-47 of human beta 1 beta 1 alcohol dehydrogenase has been replaced with Lys, 
His, Gln, and Gly by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated enzymes were 
expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The recombinant 
enzymes with Arg and His at position 47 exhibit kinetic constants and stability 
which are similar to beta 1 beta 1 and beta 2 beta 2, respectively. The 
substitution of Lys, His, or Gln for Arg-47 resulted in active enzymes with 
lower affinity for coenzyme and higher Vmax values than beta 1 beta 1. The 
substitution of Gln at position 47 resulted in an enzyme with the highest Vmax 
for ethanol oxidation of any mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase. In this series of 
enzymes, the affinity for coenzyme decreases with decreasing pKa of the 
substituted amino acid side chains. The substitution of Gly at position 47 
resulted in an enzyme with a Vmax that was one-half that of the low activity 
beta 1 beta 1 and coenzyme affinities that are lower than beta 1 beta 1, but are 
equal to or greater than the affinities exhibited by the His-47 or Gln-47 
enzymes. Product inhibition studies indicated a change in mechanism from ordered 
Bi Bi for beta 1 beta 1 to rapid equilibrium random Bi Bi for the Gly-47 enzyme. 
The kinetic properties of the Gly-47 enzyme are substantially different from 
human liver alpha alpha which also has Gly at position 47.
