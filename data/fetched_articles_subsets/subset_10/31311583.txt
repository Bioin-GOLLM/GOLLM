BACKGROUND: Micro(mi)RNAs are increasingly recognized as central regulators of 
immune cell function. While it has been predicted that miRNAs have multiple 
targets, the majority of these predictions still await experimental 
confirmation. Here, miR-34a, a well-known tumor suppressor, is analyzed for 
targeting genes involved in immune system processes of leucocytes.
METHODS: Using an in-silico approach, we combined miRNA target prediction with 
GeneTrail2, a web tool for Multi-omics enrichment analysis, to identify miR-34a 
target genes, which are involved in the immune system process subcategory of 
Gene Ontology.
RESULTS: Out of the 193 predicted target genes in this subcategory we 
experimentally tested 22 target genes and confirmed binding of miR-34a to 14 
target genes including VAMP2, IKBKE, MYH9, MARCH8, KLRK1, CD11A, TRAFD1, CCR1, 
PYDC1, PRF1, PIK3R2, PIK3CD, AP1B1, and ADAM10 by dual luciferase assays. By 
transfecting Jurkat, primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with miR-34a, we demonstrated 
that ectopic expression of miR-34a leads to reduced levels of endogenous VAMP2 
and CD11A, which are central to the analyzed subcategories. Functional 
downstream analysis of miR-34a over-expression in activated CD8+ T cells 
exhibits a distinct decrease of PRF1 secretion.
CONCLUSIONS: By simultaneous targeting of 14 mRNAs miR-34a acts as major hub of 
T cell regulatory networks suggesting to utilize miR-34a as target of 
intervention towards a modulation of the immune responsiveness of T-cells in a 
broad tumor context.
