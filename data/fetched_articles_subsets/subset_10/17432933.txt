The relationship between parasite fitness and virulence has been the object of 
experimental and theoretical studies often with conflicting conclusions. Here, 
we provide direct experimental evidence that viral fitness and virulence, both 
measured in the same biological environment provided by host cells in culture, 
can be two unrelated traits. A biological clone of foot-and-mouth disease virus 
acquired high fitness and virulence (cell killing capacity) upon large 
population passages in cell culture. However, subsequent plaque-to-plaque 
transfers resulted in profound fitness loss, but only a minimal decrease of 
virulence. While fitness-decreasing mutations have been mapped throughout the 
genome, virulence determinants-studied here with mutant and chimeric 
viruses-were multigenic, but concentrated on some genomic regions. Therefore, we 
propose a model in which viral virulence is more robust to mutation than viral 
fitness. As a consequence, depending on the passage regime, viral fitness and 
virulence can follow different evolutionary trajectories. This lack of 
correlation is relevant to current models of attenuation and virulence in that 
virus de-adaptation need not entail a decrease of virulence.
