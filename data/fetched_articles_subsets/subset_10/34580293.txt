In eukaryotes, an Hsp70 molecular chaperone triad assists folding of nascent 
chains emerging from the ribosome tunnel. In fungi, the triad consists of 
canonical Hsp70 Ssb, atypical Hsp70 Ssz1 and J-domain protein cochaperone Zuo1. 
Zuo1 binds the ribosome at the tunnel exit. Zuo1 also binds Ssz1, tethering it 
to the ribosome, while its J-domain stimulates Ssb's ATPase activity to drive 
efficient nascent chain interaction. But the function of Ssz1 and how Ssb 
engages at the ribosome are not well understood. Employing in vivo site-specific 
crosslinking, we found that Ssb(ATP) heterodimerizes with Ssz1. Ssb, in a manner 
consistent with the ADP conformation, also crosslinks to ribosomal proteins 
across the tunnel exit from Zuo1. These two modes of Hsp70 Ssb interaction at 
the ribosome suggest a functionally efficient interaction pathway: first, 
Ssb(ATP) with Ssz1, allowing optimal J-domain and nascent chain engagement; 
then, after ATP hydrolysis, Ssb(ADP) directly with the ribosome.
