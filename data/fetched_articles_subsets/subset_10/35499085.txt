The glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) produces primary urine and is composed 
of a fenestrated endothelium, a glomerular basement membrane (GBM), podocytes, 
and a slit diaphragm. Impairment of the GFB leads to albuminuria and 
microhematuria. The GBM is generated via secreted proteins from both endothelial 
cells and podocytes and is supposed to majorly contribute to filtration 
selectivity. While genetic mutations or variations of GBM components have been 
recently proposed to be a common cause of glomerular diseases, pathways 
modifying and stabilizing the GBM remain incompletely understood. Here, we 
identified prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2 (P3H2) as a regulator of the GBM in an a 
cohort of patients with albuminuria. P3H2 hydroxylates the 3' of prolines in 
collagen IV subchains in the endoplasmic reticulum. Characterization of a 
P3h2ΔPod mouse line revealed that the absence of P3H2 protein in podocytes 
induced a thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) phenotype with a thinner GBM 
than that in WT mice and the development of microhematuria and microalbuminuria 
over time. Mechanistically, differential quantitative proteomics of the GBM 
identified a significant decrease in the abundance of collagen IV subchains and 
their interaction partners in P3h2ΔPod mice. To our knowledge, P3H2 protein is 
the first identified GBM modifier, and loss or mutation of P3H2 causes TBMN and 
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in mice and humans.
