Despite significant attractiveness of antisense oligonucleotide/RNAi technology, 
its clinical application has been precluded by a lack of methods for targeted 
delivery and transduction of primary immune cells in vivo. Here, we devised a 
chemokine CCL17-based strategy (TARC-arp) that transiently silences expression 
of genes in immune cells by delivering inhibitory oligonucleotides through their 
chemokine receptors. In modeling studies using mice with established 4T1.2 
breast cancer, we show that IL10 produced by CCR4 cells, in particular FoxP3 
regulatory T cells (Tregs), plays an important role in lung metastasis. As such, 
TARC-arp-mediated silencing of IL10 or FoxP3 in CCR4 Tregs is sufficient to 
block lung metastasis. Thus, we provide a simple solution that circumvents the 
problems of RNAi use in vivo, indicating that a disease outcome can be 
successfully controlled by delivering inhibitory oligonucleotides with 
chemokines to inactivate a selective subset of immune cells.
