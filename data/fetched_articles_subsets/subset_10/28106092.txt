Human genetic studies have implicated the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 as 
a therapeutic target for the treatment of pain. A novel peptide, 
μ-theraphotoxin-Pn3a, isolated from venom of the tarantula Pamphobeteus 
nigricolor, potently inhibits NaV1.7 (IC50 0.9 nM) with at least 40-1000-fold 
selectivity over all other NaV subtypes. Despite on-target activity in 
small-diameter dorsal root ganglia, spinal slices, and in a mouse model of pain 
induced by NaV1.7 activation, Pn3a alone displayed no analgesic activity in 
formalin-, carrageenan- or FCA-induced pain in rodents when administered 
systemically. A broad lack of analgesic activity was also found for the 
selective NaV1.7 inhibitors PF-04856264 and phlotoxin 1. However, when 
administered with subtherapeutic doses of opioids or the enkephalinase inhibitor 
thiorphan, these subtype-selective NaV1.7 inhibitors produced profound 
analgesia. Our results suggest that in these inflammatory models, acute 
administration of peripherally restricted NaV1.7 inhibitors can only produce 
analgesia when administered in combination with an opioid.
