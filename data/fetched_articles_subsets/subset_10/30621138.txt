The reactions of antioxidants with superoxide radical were studied by cyclic 
voltammetry (CV)-and hydrodynamic voltammetry at a rotating ring-disk electrode 
(RRDE). In both methods, the superoxide is generated in solution from dissolved 
oxygen and then measured after being allowed to react with the antioxidant being 
studied. Both methods detected and measured the radical scavenging but the RRDE 
was able to give detailed insight into the antioxidant behavior. Three 
flavonoids, chrysin, quercetin and eriodictyol, were studied, their scavenging 
activity of superoxide was assessed and the molecular structure of each 
flavonoid was related to its scavenging capability. From our improved and novel 
RRDE method, we determine the ability of these 3 antioxidants to react with 
superoxide radical in a more quantitative manner than the classical CV. Density 
Functional Theory (DFT) and single crystal X-ray diffraction data provide 
structural information that assists in clarifying the scavenging molecular 
mechanism. Hydroxyls associated with the A ring, as found in chrysin, scavenge 
superoxide in a different manner than those found in the B ring of flavonoids, 
as those in quercetin and eriodictyol.
