Bovine rotavirus strain B223 is the North American prototype for group A P8[11] 
serotype/genotype rotaviruses. Rotaviruses with this serotype/genotype are a 
prevalent cause of neonatal calf diarrhea and have also been isolated from 
asymptomatic human infants. On the basis of deduced amino acid sequence of the 
outer capsid viral protein 4 (VP4), strain B223 lacks a cysteine at position 318 
that is conserved among all other rotavirus strains. It has been speculated that 
this may result in the loss of disulfide bond and a change in the structure of 
the VP4 that may affect the infectivity and antigenicity of the virus. This 
paper describes partial sequences of the VP4 gene (nucleotides 613 to 1016 
coding for amino acid positions 202 to 335) of 16 bovine rotavirus field 
isolates with P8[11] that were obtained from calves in Nebraska and Indiana. All 
the isolates lack a cystein at position 203 and had a conserved valine residue 
at position 318, thus indicating that the prototype strain B223 is 
representative of group A rotaviruses with P8[11] serotype/genotype.
