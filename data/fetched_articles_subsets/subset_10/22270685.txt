COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism has been associated with both symptoms of 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and disruptive behavior 
disorders (DBD): that is, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct 
disorder (CD) often comorbid with ADHD. The aim of this study was to test the 
association between COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism and the presence of DBD in 
children with ADHD (n = 516). Homozygous Val/Val children showed a higher 
prevalence of ADHD comorbid with DBD (χ(2) = 5.762; p = 0.016; OR = 1.58; 
CI(95%) = 1.07-2.35). Our findings replicate previous results and suggest a role 
for COMT in the etiology of DBD in children and adolescents with ADHD.
