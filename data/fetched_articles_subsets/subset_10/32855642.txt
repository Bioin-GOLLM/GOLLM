BACKGROUND: Animal model studies show that reductive stress is involved in 
cardiomyopathy and myopathy, but the exact physiological relevance remains 
unknown. In addition, the microRNAs miR-143 and miR-145 have been shown to be 
upregulated in cardiac diseases, but the underlying mechanisms associated with 
these regulators have yet to be explored.
METHODS: We developed transgenic mouse lines expressing exogenous miR-143 and 
miR-145 under the control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain (αMHC) 
promoter/enhancer.
RESULTS: The two transgenic lines showed dilated cardiomyopathy-like 
characteristics and early lethality with markedly increased expression of 
miR-143. The expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2), a cardioprotective gene that is a 
target of miR-143, was strongly suppressed in the transgenic hearts, but the in 
vitro HK activity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content were comparable to 
those observed in wild-type mice. In addition, transgenic complementation of HK2 
expression did not reduce mortality rates. Although HK2 is crucial for the 
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and glycolysis, the ratio of reduced glutathione 
(GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was unexpectedly higher in the hearts of 
transgenic mice. The expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy 
subunit (γ-GCSc) and the in vitro activity of glutathione reductase (GR) were 
also higher, suggesting that the recycling of GSH and its de novo biosynthesis 
were augmented in transgenic hearts. Furthermore, the expression levels of 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, a rate-limiting enzyme for the PPP) and 
p62/SQSTM1 (a potent inducer of glycolysis and glutathione production) were 
elevated, while p62/SQSTM1 was upregulated at the mRNA level rather than as a 
result of autophagy inhibition. Consistent with this observation, nuclear factor 
erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and 
inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α) were activated, all of which are known 
to induce p62/SQSTM1 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of miR-143 and miR-145 leads to a unique dilated 
cardiomyopathy phenotype with a reductive redox shift despite marked 
downregulation of HK2 expression. Reductive stress may be involved in a wider 
range of cardiomyopathies than previously thought.
