PdTe is a superconductor with Tc ~ 4.25 K. Recently, evidence for bulk-nodal and 
surface-nodeless gap features has been reported in PdTe. Here, we investigate 
the physical properties of PdTe in both the normal and superconducting states 
via specific heat and magnetic torque measurements and first-principles 
calculations. Below Tc, the electronic specific heat initially decreases in T3 
behavior (1.5 K < T < Tc) then exponentially decays. Using the two-band model, 
the superconducting specific heat can be well described with two energy gaps: 
one is 0.372 meV and another 1.93 meV. The calculated bulk band structure 
consists of two electron bands (α and β) and two hole bands (γ and η) at the 
Fermi level. Experimental detection of the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) 
oscillations allows us to identify four frequencies (Fα = 65 T, Fβ = 658 T, 
Fγ = 1154 T, and Fη = 1867 T for H // a), consistent with theoretical 
predictions. Nontrivial α and β bands are further identified via both 
calculations and the angle dependence of the dHvA oscillations. Our results 
suggest that PdTe is a candidate for unconventional superconductivity.
