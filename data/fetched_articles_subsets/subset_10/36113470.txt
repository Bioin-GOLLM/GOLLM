Apical-basal polarity is an essential epithelial trait controlled by the 
evolutionarily conserved PAR-aPKC polarity network. Dysregulation of polarity 
proteins disrupts tissue organization during development and in disease, but the 
underlying mechanisms are unclear due to the broad implications of polarity 
loss. Here, we uncover how Drosophila aPKC maintains epithelial architecture by 
directly observing tissue disorganization after fast optogenetic inactivation in 
living adult flies and ovaries cultured ex vivo. We show that fast aPKC 
perturbation in the proliferative follicular epithelium produces large 
epithelial gaps that result from increased apical constriction, rather than loss 
of apical-basal polarity. Accordingly, we can modulate the incidence of 
epithelial gaps by increasing and decreasing actomyosin-driven contractility. We 
traced the origin of these large epithelial gaps to tissue rupture next to 
dividing cells. Live imaging shows that aPKC perturbation induces apical 
constriction in non-mitotic cells within minutes, producing pulling forces that 
ultimately detach dividing and neighboring cells. We further demonstrate that 
epithelial rupture requires a global increase of apical constriction, as it is 
prevented by the presence of non-constricting cells. Conversely, a global 
induction of apical tension through light-induced recruitment of RhoGEF2 to the 
apical side is sufficient to produce tissue rupture. Hence, our work reveals 
that the roles of aPKC in polarity and actomyosin regulation are separable and 
provides the first in vivo evidence that excessive tissue stress can break the 
epithelial barrier during proliferation.
