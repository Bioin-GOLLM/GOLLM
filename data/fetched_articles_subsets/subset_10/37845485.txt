In vitro-transcribed (IVT) mRNA has arisen as a rapid method for the production 
of nucleic acid drugs. Here, we have constructed an oncolytic IVT mRNA that 
utilizes human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2) internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) 
to selectively trigger translation in cancer cells with high expression of 
EIF4G2 and PTBP1. The oncolytic effect was provided by a long hGSDMDc .825 
T>A/c.884 A>G-F1LCT mutant mRNA sequence with mitochondrial inner membrane 
cardiolipin targeting toxicity that triggers mitophagy. Utilizing the permuted 
intron-exon (PIE) splicing circularization strategy and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
encapsulation reduced immunogenicity of the mRNA and enabled delivery to 
eukaryotic cells in vivo. Engineered HRV2 IRESs-GSDMDp.D275E/E295G-F1LCT 
circRNA-LNPs (GSDMDENG circRNA) successfully inhibited EIF4G2+/PTBP1+ 
pan-adenocarcinoma xenografts growth. Importantly, in a spontaneous tumor model 
with abnormal EIF4G2 and PTBP1 caused by KRAS G12D mutation, GSDMDENG circRNA 
significantly prevented the occurrence of pancreatic, lung and colon 
adenocarcinoma, improved the survival rate and induced persistent KRAS G12D 
tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses.
