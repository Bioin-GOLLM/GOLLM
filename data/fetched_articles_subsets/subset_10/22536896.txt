BACKGROUND: NCRNAs (noncoding RNAs) play important roles in many biological 
processes. Existing genome-scale ncRNA search tools identify ncRNAs in local 
sequence alignments generated by conventional sequence comparison methods. 
However, some types of ncRNA lack strong sequence conservation and tend to be 
missed or mis-aligned by conventional sequence comparison.
RESULTS: In this paper, we propose an ncRNA identification framework that is 
complementary to existing sequence comparison tools. By integrating a filtration 
step based on Hamming distance and ncRNA alignment programs such as FOLDALIGN or 
PLAST-ncRNA, the proposed ncRNA search framework can identify ncRNAs that lack 
strong sequence conservation. In addition, as the ratio of transition and 
transversion mutation is often used as a discriminative feature for functional 
ncRNA identification, we incorporate this feature into the filtration step using 
a coding strategy. We apply Hamming distance seeds to ncRNA search in the 
intergenic regions of human and mouse genomes and between the Burkholderia 
cenocepacia J2315 genome and the Ralstonia solanacearum genome. The experimental 
results demonstrate that a carefully designed Hamming distance seed can achieve 
better sensitivity in searching for poorly conserved ncRNAs than conventional 
sequence comparison tools.
CONCLUSIONS: Hamming distance seeds provide better sensitivity as a filtration 
strategy for genome-wide ncRNA homology search than the existing seeding 
strategies used in BLAST-like tools. By combining Hamming distance seeds 
matching and ncRNA alignment, we are able to find ncRNAs with sequence 
similarities below 60%.
