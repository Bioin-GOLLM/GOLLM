Detection of RAS and BRAF mutations is essential to determine the optimal 
treatment strategy for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). We prospectively 
evaluated the MEBGEN RASKET-B KIT (RASKET-B), a novel multiplex kit, 
simultaneously detecting 48 types of RAS mutations and the BRAF V600E mutation 
using Luminex xMAP technology. The aim was to obtain market approval for 
RASKET-B as an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) option in Japan. Genomic DNA was 
extracted from 302 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues obtained from CRC 
patients. The primary endpoints were the concordance rate (CR) between the 
results from RASKET-B and the previously approved IVD kit (RASKET) for RAS 
mutations, and CR between the results from RASKET-B and direct sequencing (DS) 
for BRAF mutations. The secondary endpoints included the CR between RASKET-B and 
DS for RAS mutations and between RASKET-B and the pyrosequencing (PYRO) for the 
BRAF V600E mutation. Among the 302 samples, 142 RAS mutations (47%) and 18 BRAF 
V600E mutations (6.0%) were detected by RASKET-B. All mutations detected in the 
recruited patients were mutually exclusive. Both RAS and BRAF mutation rates 
were statistically higher in right-sided than left-sided CRC. The CR between 
RASKET-B and RASKET for RAS gene and RASKET-B and DS for BRAF V600E mutation was 
100% for both (95% CI: 99%-100%). The results from RASKET-B were also highly 
concordant with DS for RAS (97.4%) and with PYRO for the BRAF (V600E) gene 
(99.7%). RASKET-B thus provides rapid, precise, and simultaneous detection of 
RAS and BRAF mutations in CRC.
