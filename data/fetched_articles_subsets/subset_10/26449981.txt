BACKGROUND: Among adolescent novice smokers, craving is often the first, and is 
the most reported, symptom of nicotine dependence. Until now, little has been 
known about the development of craving symptoms in novice smokers. The aim of 
this study was to identify specific genetic (i.e., DRD2 Taq1A, DRD4 48 bp VNTR, 
and OPRM1 A118G polymorphisms) and environmental mechanisms that underlie the 
emergence of both cue-induced and cognitive craving among adolescent novice 
smokers.
METHOD: A five-wave longitudinal, genetically-informed survey study was 
conducted with intervals of four months. The sample included 376 early 
adolescent smokers (12-13 years of age at baseline). Self-report questionnaires 
were completed regarding smoking behavior, observed parental smoking behavior, 
and both cue-induced and cognitive craving.
RESULTS: Data were analyzed with a latent growth curve approach. For both 
cue-induced and cognitive craving, significant interaction effects were found 
for DRD2 Taq1A with parental smoke exposure. A1-allele carriers did not seem to 
be influenced by the environment with regard to craving development. Adolescents 
who are homozygous for the A2-allele and who are more exposed to parental 
smoking experience the highest levels of both types of craving over time. No 
significant interaction effects were found between parental smoke exposure and 
DRD4 48 bp VNTR or OPRM1 A118G.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies identified DRD2 Taq1A A1-allele carriers as 
vulnerable to developing nicotine dependence. However, this study showed that 
parental smoking increased the chances of developing dependence more rapidly for 
early adolescents who are considered to be less sensitive to the rewarding 
effects of nicotine according to their DRD2 Taq1A genotype. It is thus 
especially important that these young people not be exposed to smoking in their 
social environment.
