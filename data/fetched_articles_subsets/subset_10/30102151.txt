To make successful evidence-based decisions, the brain must rapidly and 
accurately transform sensory inputs into specific goal-directed behaviors. Most 
experimental work on this subject has focused on forebrain mechanisms. Using a 
novel evidence-accumulation task for mice, we performed recording and 
perturbation studies of crus I of the lateral posterior cerebellum, which 
communicates bidirectionally with numerous forebrain regions. Cerebellar 
inactivation led to a reduction in the fraction of correct trials. Using 
two-photon fluorescence imaging of calcium, we found that Purkinje cell somatic 
activity contained choice/evidence-related information. Decision errors were 
represented by dendritic calcium spikes, which in other contexts are known to 
drive cerebellar plasticity. We propose that cerebellar circuitry may contribute 
to computations that support accurate performance in this perceptual 
decision-making task.
