Inflammatory diseases and stressor-related psychiatric disorders, for which 
inflammation is a risk factor, are increasing in modern Western societies. 
Recent studies suggest that immunoregulatory approaches are a promising tool in 
reducing the risk of suffering from such disorders. Specifically, the 
environmental saprophyte Mycobacterium vaccae National Collection of Type 
Cultures (NCTC) 11659 has recently gained attention for the prevention and 
treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders. However, effective use 
requires a sophisticated understanding of the effects of M. vaccae NCTC 11659 
and related rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGMs) on microbiome-gut-immune-brain 
interactions. This historical narrative review is intended as a first step in 
exploring these mechanisms and provides an overview of preclinical and clinical 
studies on M. vaccae NCTC 11659 and related RGMs. The overall objective of this 
review article is to increase the comprehension of, and interest in, the 
mechanisms through which M. vaccae NCTC 11659 and related RGMs promote stress 
resilience, with the intention of fostering novel clinical strategies for the 
prevention and treatment of stressor-related disorders.
