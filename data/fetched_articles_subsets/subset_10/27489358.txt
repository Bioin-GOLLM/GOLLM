CD133 is considered as a stem-like cell marker in some cancers including gastric 
cancers, and Notch1 signaling is known to play an important role in the 
maintenance and differentiation of stem-like cells. We aimed to investigate 
whether Notch1 signaling contributes to the carcinogenesis of gastric cancers 
and CD133 induction. CD133 expression was detected in 51.4% of diffuse type 
gastric cancers while it was not detected in intestinal type gastric cancers. 
Similarly, only poorly-differentiated gastric cancer cell lines expressed CD133 
and activated-Notch1. Inhibiting Notch1 signaling resulted in decreased CD133 
expression, side population cells, cell proliferation and anchorage independent 
cell growth. Chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that this Notch1 dependent 
regulation of CD133 was caused by direct binding of activated-Notch1 to the 
RBP-Jκ binding site in the 5' promoter region of CD133 gene. In addition, 
knocking down RBP-Jκ reduced CD133 induction in activated-Notch1 transfected 
cells. These findings suggested that Notch1 signaling plays an important role in 
the maintenance of the cancer stem-like phenotype in diffuse type gastric cancer 
through an RBP-Jκ dependent pathway and that inhibiting Notch1 signaling could 
be an effective therapy against CD133 positive diffuse type gastric cancers.
