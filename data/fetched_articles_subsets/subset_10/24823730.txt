BACKGROUND: Stroke is a multifactorial, polygenic disorder, influenced by both 
environmental and genetic factors.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine the association of beta-1 and 
beta-2 adrenergic receptor (AR) polymorphisms with intracerebral hemorrhagic 
stroke (ICH) in a North Indian population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and six patients with intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) and 106 age- and sex- matched controls were recruited. 
Genotyping was performed by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment 
length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. RFLP results of three samples of each 
genotype were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Mean age of cases and controls were 53.47 ± 14 and 52.92 ± 13.4, 
respectively. Significant association between Ser49Gly polymorphism of beta-1 AR 
and ICH in patients who had onset of disease at a later stage of life (>50 
years) under a dominant model of inheritance (OR, 3.6; 95% 1.4 to 9.7) was 
observed. Under the dominant model of inheritance, Gln27Glu polymorphism of 
beta-2 AR was associated with risk of ICH (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.7 to 5.8) and 
significant association persisted even after adjustment for demographic and 
other risk factor variables (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.04 to 8; P = 0.04). 
Age-stratified analysis showed an independent significant association of 
Gln27Glu polymorphism of beta-2 AR with risk of ICH in patients those had onset 
of disease at young age (<50 years) under a dominant model of inheritance (OR, 
3.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 11).
CONCLUSION: The present study provides the first preliminary evidence that 
Gln27Glu polymorphism of beta-2 AR may contribute modest effect in increase in 
risk of ICH in North Indian Population. Large prospective studies with large 
sample size are required to confirm these findings.
