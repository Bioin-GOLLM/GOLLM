INTRODUCTION: Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most common ocular paediatric 
malignancy and is caused by a mutation of the two alleles of the tumor 
suppressor gene, RB1. The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a complex 
system whose function is not yet well defined and where microvesicles, such as 
exosomes, play a key role in intercellular communication. Micro-RNAs (mRNAs) 
have emerged as important modifiers of biological mechanisms involved in cancer 
and been able to regulate tumor progression.
METHODS: Co-culture of monocytes with retinoblastoma cell lines, showed a 
significant growth decrease. Given the interaction between Rb cells and 
monocytes, we investigated the role of the supernatant in the cross-talk between 
cell lines, by taking the product of the co-culture and then using it as a 
culture medium for Rb cells.
RESULTS: miR-142-3p showed to be particularly over-expressed both in the Rb cell 
line and in the medium used for their culture, comparing to control cell line 
and the normal supernatant, respectively. Therefore, we provided evidence that 
miR-142-3p is released by monocytes in the co-culture medium's exosomes and that 
it is subsequently up-taken by Rb cells, causing the inhibition of proliferation 
of Rb cell line by affecting cell cycle progression.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the role of exosomic miR-142-3p in the TME of 
Rb and identifies new molecular targets, which are able to control tumor growth 
aiming the development of a forward-looking miR-based strategy.
