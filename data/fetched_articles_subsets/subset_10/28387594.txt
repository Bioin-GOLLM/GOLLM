The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between the gene 
polymorphisms in interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) genes with 
susceptibility and severity of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among Egyptian 
patients. Interleukin-10 -592 A/C, -1082 G/A and IFN-γ +874 T/A genotypes were 
determined in 100 chronic HCV patients and 50 healthy controls using restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and the amplification refractory mutation 
system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) respectively. IL-10 -592 A/C 
polymorphism genotyping revealed that the frequency of CC genotype was 
significantly higher in chronic HCV patients than in controls (58% versus 30%, 
P < 0.05). Regarding IL-10 -1082 G/A polymorphism genotyping, a higher frequency 
of GG genotype was found in chronic HCV patients compared to controls (31% 
versus 10%, P < 0.05). IFN-γ +874 T/A genotyping showed that TT genotype was 
significantly higher in chronic HCV participants than controls (31% versus 18%, 
P < 0.05), while a higher frequency of T allele was found in cirrhotic patients 
compared to noncirrhotic patients (P < 0.05). Our observations suggested that 
IL-10 -592 A/C, -1082 G/A, and IFN-γ +874 T/A polymorphisms had a strong 
association with susceptibility to HCV infection. However, no significant 
association was observed between the cytokines (IL-10 and IFN-γ) genotypes 
profile and HCV-liver cirrhosis risk in the studied population, except for the 
high frequency of IFN-γ +874 T allele in cirrhotic patients.
