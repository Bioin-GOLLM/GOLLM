BACKGROUND: The integrase inhibitor dolutegravir is being considered in several 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa instead of efavirenz for people initiating 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) because of superior tolerability and a lower risk 
of resistance emergence. WHO requested updated modelling results for its 2019 
Antiretroviral Guidelines update, which was restricted to the choice of 
dolutegravir or efavirenz in new ART initiators. In response to this request, we 
modelled the risks and benefits of alternative policies for initial first-line 
ART regimens.
METHODS: We updated an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission and 
progression in adults to consider information on the risk of neural tube defects 
in women taking dolutegravir at time of conception, as well as the effects of 
dolutegravir on weight gain. The model accounted for drug resistance in 
determining viral suppression, with consequences for clinical outcomes and 
mother-to-child transmission. We sampled distributions of parameters to create 
various epidemic setting scenarios, which reflected the diversity of epidemic 
and programmatic situations in sub-Saharan Africa. For each setting scenario, we 
considered the situation in 2018 and compared ART initiation policies of an 
efavirenz-based regimen in women intending pregnancy, and a dolutegravir-based 
regimen in others, and a dolutegravir-based regimen, including in women 
intending pregnancy. We considered predicted outcomes over a 20-year period from 
2019 to 2039, used a 3% discount rate, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
US$500 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted.
FINDINGS: Considering updated information on risks and benefits, a policy of ART 
initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen rather than an efavirenz-based 
regimen, including in women intending pregnancy, is predicted to bring 
population health benefits (10 990 DALYs averted per year) and to be cost-saving 
(by $2·9 million per year), leading to a reduction in the overall population 
burden of disease of 16 735 net DALYs per year for a country with an adult 
population size of 10 million. The policy involving ART initiation with a 
dolutegravir-based regimen in women intending pregnancy was cost-effective in 
87% of our setting scenarios and this finding was robust in various sensitivity 
analyses, including around the potential negative effects of weight gain.
INTERPRETATION: In the context of a range of modelled setting scenarios in 
sub-Saharan Africa, we found that a policy of ART initiation with a 
dolutegravir-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy, was 
predicted to bring population health benefits and be cost-effective, supporting 
WHO's strong recommendation for dolutegravir as a preferred drug for ART 
initiators.
