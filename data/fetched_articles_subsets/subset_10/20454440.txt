A continuous time three-state model with time-dependent transition intensities 
is formulated to describe transitions between healthy and unhealthy states 
before death. By using time continuously, known death times can be taken into 
account. To deal with possible non-ignorable missing states, a selection model 
is proposed for the joint distribution of both the state and whether or not the 
state is observed. To estimate total life expectancy and its subdivision into 
life expectancy in health and ill health, the three-state model is extrapolated 
beyond the follow-up of the study. Estimation of life expectancies is 
illustrated by analysing data from a longitudinal study of aging where 
individuals are in a state of ill health if they have ever experienced a stroke. 
Results for the selection model are compared with results for a model where 
states are assumed to be missing at random and with results for a model that 
ignores missing states.
