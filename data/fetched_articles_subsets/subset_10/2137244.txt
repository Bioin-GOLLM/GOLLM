Previous experiments have demonstrated that transcription of the human c-fos 
oncogene is activated through the action of the 289-amino acid adenovirus E1A 
gene product. In this study we have utilized a series of c-fos promoter deletion 
and substitution mutants to define regulatory sequences that allow the induction 
by E1A. Although the deletion of upstream promoter sequences has varying degrees 
of effect on overall promoter activity, these deletions retain inducibility by 
E1A. This includes the deletion of the serum response element and two elements 
that bind the ATF transcription factor. In fact, a c-fos promoter deleted to 
position -53, which leaves the TATA element but no other known functional 
element, retains inducibility, indicating a role for the TATA element in E1A 
control. Indeed, substitution of the c-fos TATA element (TATAA) with a TATA 
sequence from the simian virus 40 early promoter (TATTTAT) abolishes E1A 
inducibility; this promoter does retain responsiveness to cAMP induction, 
however, demonstrating that this TATTTAT substitution is functional. We conclude 
that the E1A-dependent activation of c-fos transcription is mediated through an 
effect on a TATA-binding protein that has specificity for the TATAA sequence.
