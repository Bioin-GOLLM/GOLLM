Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from epiblasts 
of postimplantation mouse embryos, and thus provide a useful model for studying 
"primed" pluripotent states. Here, we devised a simple and robust technique to 
derive high-quality EpiSCs using an inhibitor of WNT secretion. Using this 
method, we readily established EpiSC lines with high efficiency and were able to 
use whole embryonic portions without having to separate the epiblast from the 
visceral endoderm (VE). Expression analyses revealed that these EpiSCs 
maintained a homogeneous, undifferentiated status, yet showed high potential for 
differentiation both in vitro and in teratomas. Unlike EpiSCs derived by the 
original protocol, new EpiSC lines required continuous treatment with the Wnt 
inhibitor, suggesting some intrinsic differences from the existing EpiSCs. The 
homogeneous properties of this new version of EpiSCs should facilitate studies 
on the establishment and maintenance of a "primed" pluripotent state, and 
directed differentiation from the primed state.
