Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces death 
receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis, specifically in cancer cells, and Bid 
(BH3-interacting domain death agonist) plays an important role in TRAIL-induced 
apoptosis. Ferroptosis is a newly defined form of regulated cell death known to 
be distinct from other forms of cell death. However, our previous studies have 
shown that ferroptosis shares common pathways with other types of programmed 
cell death such as apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the role of Bid in 
the crosstalk between the ferroptotic agent-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress response and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. When human colorectal carcinoma 
HCT116 cells were treated with the ferroptosis-inducing agents artesunate and 
erastin in combination with TRAIL, TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-8 was 
enhanced, and subsequently, the truncation of Bid was increased. Similar results 
were observed when ovarian adenocarcinoma OVCAR-3 cells were treated with the 
ferroptotic agents in combination with TRAIL. Results from studies with Bid 
mutants reveal that the truncation of Bid and the presence of intact BH3 domains 
are critical for synergistic apoptosis. Nonfunctional Bid mutants were not able 
to activate the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway, which is required for 
the conversion of p19 to p17, the active form of caspase-3. These results 
indicate that Bid plays a critical role in the crosstalk between the ferroptotic 
agent-induced ER stress response and TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
