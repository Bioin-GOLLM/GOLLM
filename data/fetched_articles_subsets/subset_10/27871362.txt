Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules released by dead 
cells that trigger sterile inflammation and, in vertebrates, adaptive immunity. 
Actin is a DAMP detected in mammals by the receptor, DNGR-1, expressed by 
dendritic cells (DCs). DNGR-1 is phosphorylated by Src-family kinases and 
recruits the tyrosine kinase Syk to promote DC cross-presentation of dead 
cell-associated antigens. Here we report that actin is also a DAMP in 
invertebrates that lack DCs and adaptive immunity. Administration of actin to 
Drosophila melanogaster triggers a response characterised by selective induction 
of STAT target genes in the fat body through the cytokine Upd3 and its 
JAK/STAT-coupled receptor, Domeless. Notably, this response requires signalling 
via Shark, the Drosophila orthologue of Syk, and Src42A, a Drosophila Src-family 
kinase, and is dependent on Nox activity. Thus, extracellular actin detection 
via a Src-family kinase-dependent cascade is an ancient means of detecting cell 
injury that precedes the evolution of adaptive immunity.
