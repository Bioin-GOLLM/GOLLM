BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is crucial in managing chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and enhancing functional capacity and 
health status. Oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may be needed to 
be incorporated into rehabilitation to augment the effectiveness of physical 
training.
OBJECTIVES: To compare and assess the impact of the PR programme alone and with 
augmentation with O2 or NIV on COPD patients.
METHODS: Seventy-five COPD patients were equally divided into three groups: 
group 1 patients performed 8 week-PR programme only. Group 2 performed the PR 
programme while receiving O2. Group 3 completed the PR programme plus NIV. 
Modified Borg scale, VO2 max, modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, 
6-minute walk test, COPD assessment test score, spirometric measures and 
arterial blood gases were assessed before and after the programme.
RESULTS: The outcome measurements showed meaningful improvement compared with 
the baseline in the three studied groups. However, VO2 max in group 3 showed 
higher significant improvement than both groups 1 and 2. Regarding 6-minute walk 
test, groups 2 and 3 had a higher significant improvement than group 1. COPD 
assessment test score in group 3 showed higher significant improvement than 
groups 1 and 2. Arterial blood gases in groups 2 and 3 showed significant 
increase in partial pressure of arterial oxygen and arterial oxygen saturation, 
but group 3 only had a significant decrease in PaCO2.
CONCLUSION: O2 supplementation and NIV help severe to very severe COPD patients 
to perform higher exercise intensity, so they augment the benefits of PR.
