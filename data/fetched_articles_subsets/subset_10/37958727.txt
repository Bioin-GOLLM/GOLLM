The highly conserved TOR signaling pathway is crucial for coordinating cellular 
growth with the cell cycle machinery in eukaryotes. One of the two TOR complexes 
in budding yeast, TORC1, integrates environmental cues and promotes cell growth. 
While cells grow, they need to copy their chromosomes, segregate them in 
mitosis, divide all their components during cytokinesis, and finally physically 
separate mother and daughter cells to start a new cell cycle apart from each 
other. To maintain cell size homeostasis and chromosome stability, it is crucial 
that mechanisms that control growth are connected and coordinated with the cell 
cycle. Successive periods of high and low TORC1 activity would participate in 
the adequate cell cycle progression. Here, we review the known molecular 
mechanisms through which TORC1 regulates the cell cycle in the budding yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have been extensively used as a model organism to 
understand the role of its mammalian ortholog, mTORC1.
