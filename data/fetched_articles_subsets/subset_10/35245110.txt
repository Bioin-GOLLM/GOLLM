More than 50 neurological and neuromuscular diseases are caused by short tandem 
repeat (STR) expansions, with 37 different genes implicated to date. We describe 
the use of programmable targeted long-read sequencing with Oxford Nanopore's 
ReadUntil function for parallel genotyping of all known neuropathogenic STRs in 
a single assay. Our approach enables accurate, haplotype-resolved assembly and 
DNA methylation profiling of STR sites, from a list of predetermined candidates. 
This correctly diagnoses all individuals in a small cohort (n = 37) including 
patients with various neurogenetic diseases (n = 25). Targeted long-read 
sequencing solves large and complex STR expansions that confound established 
molecular tests and short-read sequencing and identifies noncanonical STR motif 
conformations and internal sequence interruptions. We observe a diversity of STR 
alleles of known and unknown pathogenicity, suggesting that long-read sequencing 
will redefine the genetic landscape of repeat disorders. Last, we show how the 
inclusion of pharmacogenomic genes as secondary ReadUntil targets can further 
inform patient care.
