OBJECTIVES: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterised by 
skin and systemic fibrosis culminating in organ damage. Previous genetic studies 
including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 12 
susceptibility loci satisfying genome-wide significance. Transethnic 
meta-analyses have successfully expanded the list of susceptibility genes and 
deepened biological insights for other autoimmune diseases.
METHODS: We performed transethnic meta-analysis of GWAS in the Japanese and 
European populations, followed by a two-staged replication study comprising a 
total of 4436 cases and 14 751 controls. Associations between significant single 
nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) and neighbouring genes were evaluated. Enrichment 
analysis of H3K4Me3, a representative histone mark for active promoter was 
conducted with an expanded list of SSc susceptibility genes.
RESULTS: We identified two significant SNP in two loci, GSDMA and PRDM1, both of 
which are related to immune functions and associated with other autoimmune 
diseases (p=1.4×10-10 and 6.6×10-10, respectively). GSDMA also showed a 
significant association with limited cutaneous SSc. We also replicated the 
associations of previously reported loci including a non-GWAS locus, TNFAIP3. 
PRDM1 encodes BLIMP1, a transcription factor regulating T-cell proliferation and 
plasma cell differentiation. The top SNP in GSDMA was a missense variant and 
correlated with gene expression of neighbouring genes, and this could explain 
the association in this locus. We found different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
association patterns between the two populations. Enrichment analysis suggested 
the importance of CD4-naïve primary T cell.
CONCLUSIONS: GSDMA and PRDM1 are associated with SSc. These findings provide 
enhanced insight into the genetic and biological basis of SSc.
