Clostridiumbolteae, which belongs to the Clostridium clostridioforme complex, is 
a member of the human gut microbiota. Recent analysis of seven genomes of 
Cbolteae revealed the presence of an arr-like gene. Among these strains, only 
90A7 was found to be resistant to rifampin in the absence of alteration of RpoB. 
Cloning of arr-cb from 90A7 in Escherichia coli combined with directed 
mutagenesis demonstrated that Arr-cb was functional but that a Q127→R variant 
present in 90A9 and 90B3 was inactive. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR 
analysis indicated that arr-cb was silent in the four remaining strains because 
of defective transcription. Thus, two independent mechanisms can make the 
probably intrinsic arr-cb gene of Cbolteae cryptic.
