Dysregulation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is implicated in the initiation and 
progression of various tumors, including endometrial cancer (EC). However, the 
mechanism of lncRNAs in EC tumorigenesis and progression remains largely 
unexplored. In this work, we identified a novel lncRNA DC-STAMP 
domain-containing 1-antisense 1 (DCST1-AS1), which is highly upregulated and 
correlated with poor survival in EC patients. Overexpression of DCST1-AS1 
significantly enhanced EC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and 
invasion in vitro and promoted tumor growth of EC in vivo. Mechanistically, 
DCST1-AS1 mediated EC progression by inducing the expression of homeobox B5 
(HOXB5) and cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), via acting as a competing 
endogenous RNA for microRNA-665 (miR-665) and microRNA-873-5p (miR-873-5p), 
respectively. In addition, we found that the expression of miR-665 and 
miR-873-5p was significantly downregulated, while HOXB5 and CADM1 expression 
levels were increased in EC tissues. Taken together, our findings support the 
important role of DCST1-AS1 in EC progression, and DCST1-AS1 may be used as a 
prognostic biomarker as well as a potential therapeutic target for EC.
