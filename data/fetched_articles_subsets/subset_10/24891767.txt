CD226 rs763361 variant increases susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 
Caucasians. There is no data about CD226 variants in the very heterogeneous 
Brazilian population bearing a wide degree of admixture. We investigated its 
association with T1D susceptibility, clinical phenotypes, and autoimmune 
manifestations (islet and extrapancreatic autoantibodies). Casuistry. 532 T1D 
patients and 594 controls in a case-control study. Initially, CD226 coding 
regions and boundaries were sequenced in a subset of 106 T1D patients and 102 
controls. In a second step, two CD226 variants, rs763361 (exon 7) and rs727088 
(3' UTR region), involved with CD226 regulation, were genotyped in the entire 
cohort. C-peptide and autoantibody levels were determined. No new polymorphic 
variant was found. The variants rs763361 and rs727088 were in strong linkage 
disequilibrium. The TT genotype of rs763361 was associated with TID risk (OR = 
1.503;  95%  CI = 1.135-1.991; P = 0.0044), mainly in females (P = 0.0012), 
greater frequency of anti-GAD autoantibody (31.9% × 24.5%; OR = 1.57; CI = 
1.136-2.194; P = 0.0081), and lower C-peptide levels when compared to those with 
TC + CC genotypes (0.41 ± 0.30 ng/dL versus 0.70 ± 0.53 ng/dL P = 0.0218). 
Conclusions. The rs763361 variant of CD226 gene (TT genotype) was associated 
with susceptibility to T1D and with the degree of aggressiveness of the disease 
in T1D patients from Brazil. Ancestry had no effect.
