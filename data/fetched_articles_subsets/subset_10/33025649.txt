AIMS: Tacrolimus is a critical dose drug and to avoid under- and overexposure, 
therapeutic drug monitoring is standard practice. However, rejection and 
drug-related toxicity occur despite whole-blood tacrolimus pre-dose 
concentrations ([Tac]blood ) being on target. Monitoring tacrolimus 
concentrations at the target site (within peripheral blood mononuclear cells; 
[Tac]cells ) may better correlate with drug-efficacy. The aim of this study was 
to (1) investigate the relationship between [Tac]blood and [Tac]cells , (2) 
identify factors affecting the tacrolimus distribution in cells and whole-blood, 
and (3) study the relationship between [Tac]cells and clinical outcomes after 
kidney transplantation.
METHODS: A total of 175 renal transplant recipients were prospectively followed. 
[Tac]blood and [Tac]cells were determined at Months 3, 6 and 12 
post-transplantation. Patients were genotyped for ABCB1 1199G>A and 3435C>T, 
CYP3A4 15389C>T, and CYP3A5 6986G>A. Data on rejection and tacrolimus-related 
nephrotoxicity and post-transplant diabetes mellitus were collected.
RESULTS: Correlations between [Tac]blood and [Tac]cells were moderate to poor 
(Spearman's r = 0.31; r = 0.41; r = 0.61 at Months 3, 6 and 12, respectively). 
The [Tac]cells /[Tac]blood ratio was stable over time in most patients (median 
intra-patient variability 39.0%; range 3.5%-173.2%). Age, albumin and 
haematocrit correlated with the [Tac]cells /[Tac]blood ratio. CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 
genotype combined affected both dose-corrected [Tac]blood and [Tac]cells . ABCB1 
was not significantly related to tacrolimus distribution. Neither [Tac]blood nor 
[Tac]cells correlated with clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between [Tac]blood and [Tac]cells is poor. Age, 
albumin and haematocrit correlate with the [Tac]cells /[Tac]blood ratio, whereas 
genetic variation in ABCB1, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 do not. Neither [Tac]blood nor 
[Tac]cells correlated with clinical outcomes.
