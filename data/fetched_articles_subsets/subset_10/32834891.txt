Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which originated in China in 2019, shows 
mild cold and pneumonia symptoms that can occasionally worsen and result in 
deaths. SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be the causative agent of the disease and was 
identified as being similar to SARS-CoV, a causative agent of SARS in 2003. In 
this review, we described the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2, covering various related 
studies, in particular, focusing on viruses obtained from horseshoe bats and 
pangolins that belong to Sarbecovirus, a subgenus of Betacoronavirus. We also 
describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and compare them with 
other coronaviruses. More than 30,000 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are 
available in the GISAID database as of May 28, 2020. Using the genome sequence 
data of closely related viruses, the genomic characteristics and evolution of 
SARS-CoV-2 were extensively studied. However, given the global prevalence of 
COVID-19 and the large number of associated deaths, further computational and 
experimental virological analyses are required to fully characterize SARS-CoV-2.
