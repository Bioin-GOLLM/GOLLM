Seasonal flu is an acute respiratory disease that exacts a massive toll on human 
populations, healthcare systems and economies. The disease is caused by an 
enveloped Influenza virus containing eight ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. 
Each RNP incorporates multiple copies of nucleoprotein (NP), a fragment of the 
viral genome (vRNA), and a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POL), and is 
responsible for packaging the viral genome and performing critical functions 
including replication and transcription. A complete model of an Influenza RNP in 
atomic detail can elucidate the structural basis for viral genome functions, and 
identify potential targets for viral therapeutics. In this work we construct a 
model of a complete Influenza A RNP complex in atomic detail using multiple 
sources of structural and sequence information and a series of homology-modeling 
techniques, including a motif-matching fragment assembly method. Our final model 
provides a rationale for experimentally-observed changes to viral polymerase 
activity in numerous mutational assays. Further, our model reveals specific 
interactions between the three primary structural components of the RNP, 
including potential targets for blocking POL-binding to the NP-vRNA complex. The 
methods developed in this work open the possibility of elucidating other 
functionally-relevant atomic-scale interactions in additional RNP structures and 
other biomolecular complexes.
