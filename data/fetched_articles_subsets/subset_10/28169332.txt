We explored the role of secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) 
overexpression in gastric cancer and its relationship with radiological findings 
from dual-energy spectral CT(DEsCT) and positron emission tomography/computed 
tomography (PET/CT). We established mouse metastatic models using the 
SGC-7901/sFRP1 gastric cancer cell line. A control group was established using 
the SGC-7901/vector cell line. The models were then scanned with dual-energy 
spectral CT and PET-CT. Subsequent analysis, including immunohistochemistry and 
Transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labelling 
(TUNEL), was performed to confirm the role of sFRP1. Transwell chamber and 
angiogenesis assays were conducted to verify the effect of sFRP1 in vitro. We 
found that the control group showed negative radiological performance with 
successful implantation. Concurrently, the treated group showed visible lesions, 
a higher FDG uptake and increasing enhancement. The immunological and 
histological analysis confirmed the positive radiological performance with 
larger size, increasing proliferation, more microvessels and less apoptosis. The 
angiogenic up-regulation of sFRP1 overexpression were further verified with in 
vitro cell models. This preliminary study demonstrates that sFRP1 overexpression 
in gastric cancer cells leads to increased cell proliferation and angiogenesis, 
which may, in turn, contribute to positive PET/CT and CT performances.
