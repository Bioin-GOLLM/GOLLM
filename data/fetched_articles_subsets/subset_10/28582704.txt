BACKGROUND: Therapeutic strategies targeting immune checkpoint proteins have led 
to significant responses in patients with various tumor types. The success of 
these studies has led to the development of various antibodies/inhibitors for 
the different checkpoint proteins involved in immune evasion of the tumor. 
Adenosine present in high concentrations in the tumor microenvironment activates 
the immune checkpoint adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR), leading to the suppression 
of antitumor responses. Inhibition of this checkpoint has the potential to 
enhance antitumor T-cell responsiveness.
METHODS: We developed a novel A2aR antagonist (PBF-509) and tested its antitumor 
response in vitro, in a mouse model, and in non-small cell lung cancer patient 
samples.
RESULTS: Our studies showed that PBF-509 is highly specific to the A2aR as well 
as inhibitory of A2aR function in an in vitro model. In a mouse model, we found 
that lung metastasis was decreased after treatment with PBF-509 compared with 
its control. Furthermore, freshly resected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from 
lung cancer patients showed increased A2aR expression in CD4+ cells and variable 
expression in CD8+ cells. Ex vivo studies showed an increased responsiveness of 
human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes when PBF-509 was combined with anti-PD-1 or 
anti-PD-L1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that inhibition of the A2aR using the novel 
inhibitor PBF-509 could lead to novel immunotherapeutic strategies in non-small 
cell lung cancer.
