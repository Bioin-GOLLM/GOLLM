OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this article were to study a severe congenital 
protein C deficiency (PCD) in a patient with cerebral autosomal dominant 
arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and 
analyze the cause of this case.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We had recorded clinical manifestations of the patient, 
laboratory tests, imaging studies, and gene sequencing of the PROC gene and 
NOTCH3 gene to study the disease in this family. We checked the change of NOTCH3 
protein by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Laboratory studies of the patient had revealed that his PC activity was 
3%. Magnetic resonance imaging results showed hyperintense lesions in the 
cerebral white matter of the patient. PROC gene and NOTCH3 gene sequencing was 
performed among the family members. The patient was confirmed as homozygous for 
the (A-G)-12 at the transcription initiation site in the promoter region of the 
PROC gene and heterozygous mutation of the NOTCH3 gene. Immunohistochemical 
results showed that NOTCH3 protein was positive in the skin vascular smooth 
muscle of the patient.
CONCLUSIONS: We studied a rare case of an infat boy diagnosed with both 
congenital PCD and CADASIL; congenital PCD was attributable to a compound that 
was homozygous for (A-G)-12 at the transcription initiation site in the promoter 
region of the PROC gene, and CADASIL was caused by missense mutation in exon 24 
of NOTCH3. He was a sporadic patient with congenital PCD and CADASIL; it maybe 
that the deficiency of protein C led to early onset of CADASIL. The gene 
sequencing of PROC gene and NOTCH3 gene may have important value for fertility 
guidance and prenatal diagnosis.
