BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) 
is a target of Wnt signalling and considered both a cancer stem cell marker and 
intestinal stem cell marker. We found first some splice variants of LGR5 in 
human intestine and elucidated the functional feature of full-length LGR5 
(LGR5FL).
METHODS: Reverse transcript PCR using mRNA extracted from intestine revealed the 
existence of LGR5 splice variants. We designed an antibody that recognises only 
LGR5FL and assessed immunohistochemically the distribution of LGR5FL-positive 
cells and Ki-67-positive cells in clinical samples.
RESULTS: Two LGR5 splice variants were expressed in the human intestine crypt 
cells; one lacked exon 5 and the other lacked exons 5-8. Only LGR5FL appeared 
during cell cycle arrest, whereas the transcript variants appeared when the cell 
cycle was proceeding. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation showed that 
LGR5FL-positive cells were negative for Ki-67. Comparing prechemotherapy and 
post-chemotherapy specimens, the population of LGR5FL-positive cells 
significantly increased with therapy (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The function of LGR5FL-positive cells had low cell proliferative 
ability compared with the cells, which expressed splice variants of LGR5 and 
remained after chemotherapy. Designing therapeutic strategies that target 
LGR5FL-positive cells seems to be important in colorectal cancer.
