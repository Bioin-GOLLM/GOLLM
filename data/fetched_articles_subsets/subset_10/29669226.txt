BACKGROUND: Donor availability and transplantation-related risks limit the broad 
use of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation in patients with 
transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia. After previously establishing that 
lentiviral transfer of a marked β-globin (βA-T87Q) gene could substitute for 
long-term red-cell transfusions in a patient with β-thalassemia, we wanted to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of such gene therapy in patients with 
transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia.
METHODS: In two phase 1-2 studies, we obtained mobilized autologous CD34+ cells 
from 22 patients (12 to 35 years of age) with transfusion-dependent 
β-thalassemia and transduced the cells ex vivo with LentiGlobin BB305 vector, 
which encodes adult hemoglobin (HbA) with a T87Q amino acid substitution 
(HbAT87Q). The cells were then reinfused after the patients had undergone 
myeloablative busulfan conditioning. We subsequently monitored adverse events, 
vector integration, and levels of replication-competent lentivirus. Efficacy 
assessments included levels of total hemoglobin and HbAT87Q, transfusion 
requirements, and average vector copy number.
RESULTS: At a median of 26 months (range, 15 to 42) after infusion of the 
gene-modified cells, all but 1 of the 13 patients who had a non-β0/β0 genotype 
had stopped receiving red-cell transfusions; the levels of HbAT87Q ranged from 
3.4 to 10.0 g per deciliter, and the levels of total hemoglobin ranged from 8.2 
to 13.7 g per deciliter. Correction of biologic markers of dyserythropoiesis was 
achieved in evaluated patients with hemoglobin levels near normal ranges. In 9 
patients with a β0/β0 genotype or two copies of the IVS1-110 mutation, the 
median annualized transfusion volume was decreased by 73%, and red-cell 
transfusions were discontinued in 3 patients. Treatment-related adverse events 
were typical of those associated with autologous stem-cell transplantation. No 
clonal dominance related to vector integration was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Gene therapy with autologous CD34+ cells transduced with the BB305 
vector reduced or eliminated the need for long-term red-cell transfusions in 22 
patients with severe β-thalassemia without serious adverse events related to the 
drug product. (Funded by Bluebird Bio and others; HGB-204 and HGB-205
