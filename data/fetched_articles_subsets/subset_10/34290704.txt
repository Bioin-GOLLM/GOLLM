Telomerase-based therapeutic cancer vaccines (TCVs) have been under clinical 
investigation for the past two decades. Despite past failures, TCVs have gained 
renewed enthusiasm for their potential to improve the efficacy of checkpoint 
inhibition. Telomerase stands as an attractive target for TCVs due to its almost 
universal presence in cancer and its essential function promoting tumor growth. 
Herein, we review tumor telomerase biology that may affect the efficacy of 
therapeutic vaccination and provide insights on optimal vaccine design and 
treatment combinations. Tumor types possessing mechanisms of increased 
telomerase expression combined with an immune permissive tumor microenvironment 
are expected to increase the therapeutic potential of telomerase-targeting 
cancer vaccines. Regardless, rational treatment combinations, such as checkpoint 
inhibitors, are likely necessary to bring out the true clinical potential of 
TCVs.
