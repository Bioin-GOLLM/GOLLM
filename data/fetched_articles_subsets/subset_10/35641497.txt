The dysregulated physical interaction between two intracellular membrane 
proteins, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase and its reversible 
inhibitor phospholamban, induces heart failure by inhibiting calcium cycling. 
While phospholamban is a bona-fide therapeutic target, approaches to selectively 
inhibit this protein remain elusive. Here, we report the in vivo application of 
intracellular acting antibodies (intrabodies), derived from the variable domain 
of camelid heavy-chain antibodies, to modulate the function of phospholamban. 
Using a synthetic VHH phage-display library, we identify intrabodies with high 
affinity and specificity for different conformational states of phospholamban. 
Rapid phenotypic screening, via modified mRNA transfection of primary cells and 
tissue, efficiently identifies the intrabody with most desirable features. 
Adeno-associated virus mediated delivery of this intrabody results in 
improvement of cardiac performance in a murine heart failure model. Our strategy 
for generating intrabodies to investigate cardiac disease combined with modified 
mRNA and adeno-associated virus screening could reveal unique future therapeutic 
opportunities.
