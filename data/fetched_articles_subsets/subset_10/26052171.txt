NMR metabolic fingerprinting methods almost exclusively rely upon the use of 
one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR data to gain insights into chemical differences 
between two or more experimental classes. While 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy is a 
powerful, highly informative technique that can rapidly and nondestructively 
report details of complex metabolite mixtures, it suffers from significant 
signal overlap that hinders interpretation and quantification of individual 
analytes. Two-dimensional (2D) NMR methods that report heteronuclear 
connectivities can reduce spectral overlap, but their use in metabolic 
fingerprinting studies is limited. We describe a generalization of Adaptive 
Intelligent binning that enables its use on multidimensional datasets, allowing 
the direct use of nD NMR spectroscopic data in bilinear factorizations such as 
principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS).
