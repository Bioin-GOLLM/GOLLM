Vibrio cholerae, the causative pathogen of the life-threatening infection 
cholera, encodes two copies of β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III 
(vcFabH1 and vcFabH2). vcFabH1 and vcFabH2 are pathogenic proteins associated 
with fatty acid synthesis, lipid metabolism, and potential applications in 
biofuel production. Our biochemical assays characterize vcFabH1 as exhibiting 
specificity for acetyl-CoA and CoA thioesters with short acyl chains, similar to 
that observed for FabH homologs found in most gram-negative bacteria. vcFabH2 
prefers medium chain-length acyl-CoA thioesters, particularly octanoyl-CoA, 
which is a pattern of specificity rarely seen in bacteria. Structural 
characterization of one vcFabH1 and six vcFabH2 structures determined in either 
apo form or in complex with acetyl-CoA/octanoyl-CoA indicate that the 
substrate-binding pockets of vcFabH1 and vcFabH2 are of different sizes, 
accounting for variations in substrate chain-length specificity. An unusual and 
unique feature of vcFabH2 is its C-terminal fragment that interacts with both 
the substrate-entrance loop and the dimer interface of the enzyme. Our discovery 
of the pattern of substrate specificity of both vcFabH1 and vcFabH2 can 
potentially aid the development of novel antibacterial agents against 
V. cholerae. Additionally, the distinctive substrate preference of FabH2 in 
V. cholerae and related facultative anaerobes conceivably make it an attractive 
component of genetically engineered bacteria used for commercial biofuel 
production.
