Specialized chromatin exists at centromeres and must be precisely transmitted 
during DNA replication. The mechanisms involved in the propagation of these 
structures remain elusive. Fission yeast centromeres are composed of two 
chromatin domains: the central CENP-A(Cnp1) kinetochore domain and flanking 
heterochromatin domains. Here we show that fission yeast Mcl1, a DNA polymerase 
alpha (Pol alpha) accessory protein, is critical for maintenance of centromeric 
chromatin. In a screen for mutants that alleviate both central domain and outer 
repeat silencing, we isolated several cos mutants, of which cos1 is allelic to 
mcl1. The mcl1-101 mutation causes reduced CENP-A(Cnp1) in the central domain 
and an aberrant increase in histone acetylation in both domains. These 
phenotypes are also observed in a mutant of swi7(+), which encodes a catalytic 
subunit of Pol alpha. Mcl1 forms S-phase-specific nuclear foci, which colocalize 
with those of PCNA and Pol alpha. These results suggest that Mcl1 and Pol alpha 
are required for propagation of centromere chromatin structures during DNA 
replication.
