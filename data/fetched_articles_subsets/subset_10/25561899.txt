IL-27, a heterodimeric cytokine of IL-12 family, regulates both innate and 
adaptive immunity largely via Jak-Stat signaling. IL-27 can induce IFN-Î³ and 
inflammatory mediators from T lymphocytes and innate immune cells. IL-27 has 
unique anti-inflammatory properties via both Tr1 cells dependent and independent 
mechanisms. Here the role and biology of IL-27 in innate and adaptive immunity 
are summarized, with special interest with immunity against Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis.
