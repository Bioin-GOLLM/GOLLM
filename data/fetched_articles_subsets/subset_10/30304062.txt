INTRODUCTION: The therapeutic response to statins has a high interindividual 
variability with respect to reductions in plasma LDL-cholesterol (c-LDL) and 
increases in HDL cholesterol (c-HDL). Many studies suggest that there is a 
relationship between the rs20455 KIF6 gene variant (c.2155T> C, Trp719Arg) and a 
lower risk of cardiovascular disease in patients being treated with statins.
AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not the c.2155T> C KIF6 
gene variant modulates the hypercholesteremic effects of treatment with 
simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, observational and multicenter 
study. Three hundred and forty-four patients who had not undergone prior 
lipid-lowering treatment were recruited. Simvastatin, atorvastatin or 
rosuvastatin were administered. Lipid profiles and multiple clinical and 
biochemical variables were assessed before and after treatment.
RESULTS: The c.2155T> C variant of the KIF6 gene was shown to influence 
physiological responses to treatment with simvastatin and atorvastatin. Patients 
who were homozygous for the c.2155T> C variant (CC genotype, ArgArg) had a 7.0% 
smaller reduction of LDL cholesterol levels (p = 0.015) in response to 
hypolipidemic treatment compared to patients with the TT (TrpTrp) or CT (TrpArg) 
genotype. After pharmacological treatment with rosuvastatin, patients carrying 
the genetic variant had an increase in c-HDL that was 21.9% lower compared to 
patients who did not carry the variant (p = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: Being a carrier of the c.2155T> C variant of the KIF6 gene 
negatively impacts patient responses to simvastatin, atorvastatin or 
rosuvastatin in terms of lipid lowering effect. Increasing the intensity of 
hypolipidemic therapy may be advisable for patients who are positive for the 
c.2155T> C variant.
