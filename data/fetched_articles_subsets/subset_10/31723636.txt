Acute cerebral infarctions are rare in children, however they can occur as a 
complication of a Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infection due to direct invasion, 
vasculitis, or a hypercoagulable state. We report on the case of a 5-year-old 
boy who had an extensive stroke in multiple cerebrovascular territories 10 days 
after the diagnosis of MP infection. Based on the suspicion that the cerebral 
infarction was associated with a macrolide-resistant MP infection, the patient 
was treated with levofloxacin, methyl-prednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, 
and enoxaparin. Despite this medical management, cerebral vascular narrowing 
progressed and a decompressive craniectomy became necessary for the patient's 
survival. According to laboratory tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and 
clinical manifestations, the cerebral infarction in this case appeared to be due 
to the combined effects of hypercoagulability and cytokine-induced vascular 
inflammation.
