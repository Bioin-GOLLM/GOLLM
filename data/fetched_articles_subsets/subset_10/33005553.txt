Bilateral idiopathic optic neuritis is an uncommon presentation of optic 
neuritis, and the initial treatment options are limited to corticosteroids with 
consideration for plasma exchange therapy as second-line therapy. We present the 
case of a 43-year-old deaf and mute patient whose ability to communicate via 
American Sign Language was severely impaired by her recurrent idiopathic 
bilateral optic neuritis. She was treated early and aggressively with both 
plasma exchange and corticosteroids within days of presentation and experienced 
rapid improvement in her vision. Early treatment with plasma exchange should be 
considered in patients whose impairment presents a significant communication 
barrier.
