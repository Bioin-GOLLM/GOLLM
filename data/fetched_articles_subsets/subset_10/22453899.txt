Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by the expansion of CUG repeats in the 
3' UTR of DMPK transcripts. DM1 pathogenesis has been attributed in part to 
alternative splicing dysregulation via elevation of CUG-BP, Elav-like family 
member 1 (CELF1). Several therapeutic approaches have been tested in cells and 
mice, but no previous studies had specifically targeted CELF1. Here, we show 
that repressing CELF activity rescues CELF-dependent alternative splicing in 
cell culture and transgenic mouse models of DM1. CELF-independent splicing, 
however, remained dysregulated. These data highlight both the potential and 
limitations of targeting CELF1 for the treatment of DM1.
