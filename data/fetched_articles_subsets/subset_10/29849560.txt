Hearing impairment is one of the most common sensory disease, of which more than 
50% is attributed to a genetic etiology. The goal of this research is to explore 
the genetic cause of a Chinese deafness pedigree who was excluded of GJB2, 
SLC26A4, or MtDNA12SrRNA variants. Three variants, c.3971C>A (p.A1324D), 
c.4011insA (p.Q1337Qfsâˆ—22), and c.9690+1G>A, in the MYO15A gene were identified 
by targeted capture sequencing and Sanger sequencing, and the first two of them 
were novel. These variants were cosegregated with the disease in this family and 
absent in 200 normal hearing persons. They were concluded to be pathogenic 
mutations by phylogenetic analysis and structure modeling. Thus, the combined 
use of SNPScan assay and targeted capture sequencing is a high-efficiency and 
cost-effective screening procedure for hereditary hearing loss. Genetic 
counseling would be important for this family, and our finding would be a great 
supplement to the mutation spectrum of MYO15A.
