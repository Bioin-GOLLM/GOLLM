Membrane efflux pumps play a major role in bacterial multidrug resistance. The 
tripartite multidrug efflux pump system from Escherichia coli, AcrAB-TolC, is a 
target for inhibition to lessen resistance development and restore antibiotic 
efficacy, with homologs in other ESKAPE pathogens. Here, we rationalize a 
mechanism of inhibition against the periplasmic adaptor protein, AcrA, using a 
combination of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, cellular efflux 
assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. We define the structural dynamics of 
AcrA and find that an inhibitor can inflict long-range stabilisation across all 
four of its domains, whereas an interacting efflux substrate has minimal effect. 
Our results support a model where an inhibitor forms a molecular wedge within a 
cleft between the lipoyl and αβ barrel domains of AcrA, diminishing its 
conformational transmission of drug-evoked signals from AcrB to TolC. This work 
provides molecular insights into multidrug adaptor protein function which could 
be valuable for developing antimicrobial therapeutics.
