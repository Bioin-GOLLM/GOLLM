: In this paper, we study the problem of constructing perfect phylogenies for 
three-state characters. Our work builds on two recent results. The first result 
states that for three-state characters, the local condition of examining all 
subsets of three characters is sufficient to determine the global property of 
admitting a perfect phylogeny. The second result applies tools from minimal 
triangulation theory to the partition intersection graph to determine if a 
perfect phylogeny exists. Despite the wealth of combinatorial tools and 
algorithms stemming from the chordal graph and minimal triangulation literature, 
it is unclear how to use such approaches to efficiently construct a perfect 
phylogeny for three-state characters when the data admits one. We utilize 
structural properties of both the partition intersection graph and the original 
data in order to achieve a competitive time bound.
