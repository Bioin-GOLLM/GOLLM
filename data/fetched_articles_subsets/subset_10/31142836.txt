Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies protect against infection with HIV-1 
in animal models, suggesting that a vaccine that elicits these antibodies would 
be protective in humans. However, it has not yet been possible to induce 
adequate serological responses by vaccination. Here, to activate B cells that 
express precursors of broadly neutralizing antibodies within polyclonal 
repertoires, we developed an immunogen, RC1, that facilitates the recognition of 
the variable loop 3 (V3)-glycan patch on the envelope protein of HIV-1. RC1 
conceals non-conserved immunodominant regions by the addition of glycans and/or 
multimerization on virus-like particles. Immunization of mice, rabbits and 
rhesus macaques with RC1 elicited serological responses that targeted the 
V3-glycan patch. Antibody cloning and cryo-electron microscopy structures of 
antibody-envelope complexes confirmed that immunization with RC1 expands clones 
of B cells that carry the anti-V3-glycan patch antibodies, which resemble 
precursors of human broadly neutralizing antibodies. Thus, RC1 may be a suitable 
priming immunogen for sequential vaccination strategies in the context of 
polyclonal repertoires.
