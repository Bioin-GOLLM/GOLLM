INTRODUCTION: Metformin has demonstrated favorable effects on glycemic control 
in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), regardless of the body mass index (BMI). 
On the contrary, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) are reportedly less 
effective in patients having high BMI values (≥ 25 or ≥ 30). The aim of this 
study was to compare metformin and DPP-4is as first-line treatment for their 
effects on glycemic control and improvement of other health outcomes among obese 
and non-obese Japanese patients with T2D.
METHODS: A Japanese health insurance claims database that also included annual 
medical checkup data was used. This database included data on company employees 
who were members of health insurance societies and their family members. Most 
patients were aged < 65 years and most were men. Inclusion criteria were: (1) a 
first T2D diagnosis between May 2010 and June 2017; (2) either metformin or a 
DPP-4i prescribed as the first-line antidiabetic therapy; and (3) glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) and BMI data available for the 3-month period immediately 
preceding the initiation of antidiabetic treatment (baseline). The reduction 
rate in excessive HbA1c (> 6.5%; primary outcome) and changes in fasting plasma 
glucose, BMI, triglyceride, cholesterol, and abdominal circumference (secondary 
outcomes) at 12 months from baseline were compared between treatments.
RESULTS: When evaluated relative to the baseline BMI, the mean reduction rate in 
excessive HbA1c tended to be higher in the metformin group than in the DPP-4i 
group, especially in patients with BMI ≥ 25. Similarly, significant improvement 
was observed in most outcomes in obese patients prescribed metformin compared to 
those prescribed a DPP-4i. In contrast, in patients with BMI < 25, HbA1c 
reduction was greater in patients prescribed DPP-4i and fewer outcomes showed 
significant improvement in patients prescribed metformin.
CONCLUSION: In obese Japanese patients with T2D, greater improvements in 
glycemic control and other outcomes were seen with metformin as first-line 
treatment for T2D compared with DPP-4is, although some limitations regarding the 
database information should be considered.
