Two genetic variants that alter alcohol metabolism, ALDH2-rs671 and 
ADH1B-rs1229984, can modify oesophageal cancer risk associated with alcohol 
consumption in East Asians, but their associations with other cancers remain 
uncertain. ALDH2-rs671 G>A and ADH1B-rs1229984 G>A were genotyped in 150 722 
adults, enrolled from 10 areas in China during 2004 to 2008. After 11 years' 
follow-up, 9339 individuals developed cancer. Cox regression was used to 
estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for site-specific cancers associated with these 
genotypes, and their potential interactions with alcohol consumption. Overall, 
the A-allele frequency was 0.21 for ALDH2-rs671 and 0.69 for ADH1B-rs1229984, 
with A-alleles strongly associated with lower alcohol consumption. Among men, 
ALDH2-rs671 AA genotype was associated with HR of 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 
0.53-0.90) for IARC alcohol-related cancers (n = 1900), compared to GG genotype. 
For ADH1B-rs1229984, the HRs of AG and AA vs GG genotype were 0.80 (0.69-0.93) 
and 0.75 (0.64-0.87) for IARC alcohol-related cancers, 0.61 (0.39-0.96) and 0.61 
(0.39-0.94) for head and neck cancer (n = 196) and 0.68 (0.53-0.88) and 0.60 
(0.46-0.78) for oesophageal cancer (n = 546). There were no significant 
associations of these genotypes with risks of liver (n = 651), colorectal 
(n = 556), stomach (n = 725) or lung (n = 1135) cancers. Among male drinkers, 
the risks associated with higher alcohol consumption were greater among 
ALDH2-rs671 AG than GG carriers for head and neck, oesophageal and lung cancers 
(Pinteraction  < .02). Among women, only 2% drank alcohol regularly, with no 
comparable associations observed between genotype and cancer. These findings 
support the causal effects of alcohol consumption on upper aerodigestive tract 
cancers, with ALDH2-rs671 AG genotype further exacerbating the risks.
