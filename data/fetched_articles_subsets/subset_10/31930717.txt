OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have identified many susceptibility 
loci for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, most of these loci are 
located in noncoding regions of the genome. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are 
pervasively expressed and have been reported to be involved in various diseases. 
This study aimed to explore the genetic significance of lncRNAs in SLE.
METHODS: A genome-wide survey of SLE risk variants in lncRNA gene loci was 
performed in Han Chinese subjects (4,556 with SLE and 9,451 healthy controls). 
The functional relevance of an SLE risk variant in one of the lncRNA genes was 
explored using biochemical and molecular cell biology analyses. In vitro 
loss-of-function and gain-of-function strategies were used to clarify the 
functional and phenotypic relevance of this SLE susceptibility lncRNA. Moreover, 
correlation of this lncRNA with the degree of apoptosis in the peripheral blood 
of SLE patients was evaluated.
RESULTS: A novel SLE susceptibility locus in a lncRNA gene, designated SLEAR 
(for SLE-associated RNA), was identified at the single-nucleotide polymorphism 
rs13259960 (odds ratio 1.35, Pcombined = 1.03 × 10-11 ). The A>G variation at 
rs13259960, located in an intronic enhancer, was found to impair STAT1 
recruitment to the enhancer that loops to the SLEAR promoter, resulting in 
decreased SLEAR production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients 
with SLE (3 with the G/G genotype, 22 with A/G, and 103 with A/A at rs13259960; 
P = 0.0241). Moreover, SLEAR interacted with the RNA binding proteins 
interleukin enhancer binding factor 2, heterogeneous nuclear RNP F, and 
TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15, to form a complex for transcriptional 
activation of the downstream antiapoptotic genes. In addition, SLEAR regulated 
apoptosis of Jurkat cells in vitro, and its expression level was correlated with 
the degree of cell death in the peripheral blood of patients with SLE (r = 
0.824, P = 2.15 × 10-8 ; n = 30).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a mechanism by which the risk variant at 
rs13259960 modulates SLEAR expression and confers a predisposition to SLE. Taken 
together, these results may give insights into the etiology of SLE.
