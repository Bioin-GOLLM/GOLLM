The regulation of the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) in eukaryotic cells is 
critical for gene expression, and occurs principally at the initiation phase 
which is mainly regulated by eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). eIFs are 
fundamental for the translation of mRNA and as such act as the primary targets 
of several signaling pathways to regulate gene expression. Mis-regulated mRNA 
expression is a common feature of tumorigenesis and the abnormal activity of eIF 
complexes triggered by upstream signaling pathways is detected in many tumors, 
leading to the selective translation of mRNA encoding proteins involved in 
tumorigenesis, metastasis, or resistance to anti-cancer drugs, and making eIFs a 
promising therapeutic target for various types of cancers. Here, we briefly 
outline our current understanding of the biology of eIFs, mainly focusing on the 
effects of several signaling pathways upon their functions and discuss their 
contributions to the initiation and progression of tumor growth. An overview of 
the progress in developing agents targeting the components of translation 
machinery for cancer treatment is also provided. Video abstract.
