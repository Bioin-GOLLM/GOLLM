The extracellular "soluble" domains of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp130 
(sgp130) form a hexameric ternary receptor complex together with IL-6, 
consisting of two molecules of each component. In this report we have 
investigated the interactions of the partial IL-6 antagonist (Q159E,T162P)IL-6 
((QT)IL-6), with the sIL-6R and sgp130. The kinetic rate constants of the 
binding of sIL-6R to immobilized monomeric (QT)IL-6 or IL-6 were obtained using 
an optical biosensor with analysis of the primary data by linear and nonlinear 
regression. Both methods of analysis showed that, due to a higher off-rate, 
sIL-6R has lower apparent affinity for (QT)IL-6 than IL-6. The lower affinity of 
(QT)IL-6 was further confirmed by equilibrium binding measurements at the sensor 
surface and in solution. Using the biosensor it was also shown that the (QT)IL-6 
complex interacts with sgp130, supporting the notion that the biological 
activity of (QT)IL-6 is mediated via gp130. However, the IL-6 mutant, when 
incubated with sIL-6R and sgp130, failed to induce a stable hexameric receptor 
complex, as shown by narrowbore size exclusion chromatography.
