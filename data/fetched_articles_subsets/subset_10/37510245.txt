Acute myocardial infarction remains a significant cause of mortality worldwide 
and its burden continues to grow. Its pathophysiology is known to be complex and 
multifactorial, with several acquired and inherited risk factors. As advances in 
technology and medical therapy continue, there is now increasing recognition of 
the role that genetics play in the development and management of myocardial 
infarction. The genetic determinants of acute coronary syndrome are still vastly 
understudied, but the advent of whole-genome scanning and genome-wide 
association studies has significantly expanded the current understanding of 
genetics and simultaneously fostered hope that genetic profiling and gene-guided 
treatments could substantially impact clinical outcomes. The identification of 
genes associated with acute myocardial infarction can help in the development of 
personalized medicine, risk stratification, and improved therapeutic strategies. 
In this context, several genes have been studied, and their potential 
involvement in increasing the risk for acute myocardial infarction is being 
investigated. As such, this article provides a review of some of the genes 
potentially related to an increased risk for acute myocardial infarction as well 
as the latest updates in gene-guided risk stratification and treatment 
strategies.
