The combretastatin A-4/oltipraz hybrid (COH), 
5-(3-amino-4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-one 
(COH-203) is one of the COH compounds synthesized by our previous study, which 
has been reported to affect a number of cancer cell lines, such as SGC-7901, KB, 
HT-1080, HepG2, SMMC-7721 and BEL-7402. The sensitivity of human acute leukemia 
cell lines to COH-203, and the mechanism underlying its anti-proliferative 
effects remain unknown, which was investigated in the present study. In the 
present study, it was demonstrated that COH-203 had notable time- and 
dose-dependent antiproliferative effects on the human acute promyelocytic 
leukemia HL-60 cell line. Furthermore, COH-203 treatment resulted in cell cycle 
arrest at G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner, and subsequently induced 
apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that upregulation of cyclin B was 
associated with G2/M arrest. In addition, treatment with COH-203 resulted in 
downregulated expression of Bcl-2. This result revealed that COH-203-induced 
apoptosis in HL-60 cells may occur via the mitochondrial pathway in a 
caspase-dependent manner.
