Numerous membrane-less organelles, composed of a combination of RNA and 
proteins, are observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. These 
RNP granules include stress granules (SGs), processing bodies (PBs), Cajal 
bodies, and nuclear speckles. An unresolved question is how frequently RNA 
molecules are required for the integrity of RNP granules in either the nucleus 
or cytosol. To address this issue, we degraded intracellular RNA in either the 
cytosol or the nucleus by the activation of RNase L and examined the impact of 
RNA loss on several RNP granules. We find the majority of RNP granules, 
including SGs, Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles, and the nucleolus, are altered by 
the degradation of their RNA components. In contrast, PBs and super-enhancer 
complexes were largely not affected by RNA degradation in their respective 
compartments. RNA degradation overall led to the apparent dissolution of some 
membrane-less organelles, whereas others reorganized into structures with 
altered morphology. These findings highlight a critical and widespread role of 
RNA in the organization of several RNP granules.
