The polycomb group gene, EZH2, is highly expressed in advanced bladder cancer. 
Here we demonstrated that down-regulation of EZH2 in tumor tissues after 
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy correlated with good therapeutic response in advanced 
bladder cancer. We next developed a small molecule, NSC745885, derived from 
natural anthraquinone emodin, which down-regulated EZH2 via proteasome-mediated 
degradation. NSC745885 showed potent selective toxicity against multiple cancer 
cell lines but not normal cells. NSC745885 treatment overcame multiple-drug 
resistance and inhibited growth of resistant cancer cells. Over-expression of 
EZH2 in cancer cells attenuated effects of NSC745885, suggesting that 
down-regulation of EZH2 was responsible for growth inhibition of NSC745885. 
NSC745885 also suppressed tumor growth and down-regulated EZH2 in vivo. These 
results indicate that NSC7455889 suppresses bladder cancer by targeting EZH2.
