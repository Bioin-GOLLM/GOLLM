The frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms of IFNL3 gene (rsl12979860 and 
rs8099917) and dinucleotide polymorphism of IFNL4 gene (ss469415590) were 
estimated in healthy inhabitants of Mongolia and Irkutsk regions taking into 
account their races. Population and genetic studies were performed in 1520 
conventionally healthy volunteers (blood donors), representatives of Caucasian 
and Mongoloid races. Significant race-related differences in the incidence of 
IFNL3 and IFNL4 gene polymorphisms associated with spontaneous clearance of 
hepatitis C virus were found in healthy volunteers.
