A detailed study of the magnetocaloric effect in two isostructural bimetallic 
compounds {[MII(H2O)2]2[NbIV(CN)8]·4H2O} n (M = Mn, Fe) is presented. The 
substances show sharp phase transitions to the long-range magnetically ordered 
state with ferromagnetic coupling between M and Nb sublattices in the case of 
the Fe-based sample (FeNb, T c = 43 K) and antiferromagnetic coupling for the 
Mn-based sample (MnNb, T c = 50 K). The magnetic entropy change was found to 
reach 5.07 J mol-1 K-1 (9.09 J kg-1 K-1) for MnNb and 4.82 J mol-1 K-1 (8.65 J 
kg-1 K-1) for FeNb under the applied magnetic field change of 5 T. Isothermal 
entropy changes corresponding to different field changes are demonstrated to 
collapse on a single master curve, which confirms the magnetic transitions in 
FeNb and MnNb to be of the second order. The results obtained for FeNb and MnNb 
are discussed in the context of MCE tunability by un/blocking of magnetic 
connectivity through dis/reconnection of spatially extended ligands.
