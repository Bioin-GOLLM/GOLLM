Few trial-based assessments of ruxolitinib in patients with lower-risk 
myelofibrosis (MF) have been conducted, and no studies have made such 
assessments in a real-world population. We assessed changes in spleen size and 
constitutional symptoms during ruxolitinib treatment using a retrospective, 
observational review of anonymized US medical record data of patients diagnosed 
with IPSS low-risk (n = 25) or intermediate-1-risk (n = 83) MF. The majority of 
patients were male (low risk, 60%; intermediate-1 risk, 69%). Most patients (92% 
and 77%) were still receiving ruxolitinib at the medical record abstraction date 
(median observation/exposure time, 8 months). The proportion of patients with 
moderate or severe palpable splenomegaly (≥10 cm) decreased from diagnosis (56%) 
to best response (12%). Fatigue was reported in 47% of patients and was the most 
common constitutional symptom. For most symptoms in both risk groups, shifts in 
the distribution of severity from more to less severe from diagnosis to best 
response were observed. Both patients with low-risk and intermediate-1-risk MF 
experienced a substantial decrease in spleen size with ruxolitinib treatment in 
real-world settings. For most symptoms examined, there were distinct 
improvements in the distribution of severity during ruxolitinib treatment. These 
findings suggest that patients with lower-risk MF may benefit clinically from 
ruxolitinib treatment.
