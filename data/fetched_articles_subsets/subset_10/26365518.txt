BACKGROUND: Disturbance of the serotonergic system contributes to the etiology 
of bipolar disorder (BD). Tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) is an important 
rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic pathway for brain serotonin and has been 
suggested to play a role in BD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all 
studies to date investigating the association studies between TPH2 and BD 
published before Aug 2014. All studies were abstracted from PubMed, Embase, 
HuGNet, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Manuscripts and the 
supplementary documents of published genome-wide association studies in the 
field were also included. Effect sizes of independent loci that have been 
studied in more than three articles were synthesized using fixed and random 
effects models.
RESULTS: Eight eligible studies addressed association between 63 TPH2 gene 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with BD, after linkage disequilibrium 
analysis, 12 independent SNPs were identified. Finally, three SNPs (rs4760820, 
rs11178998, and rs7954758) were found associated with BD using fixed effects 
models, and rs4760820 and rs11178998 were still associated with BD even with the 
more conservative random effects models.
CONCLUSIONS: rs4760820 and rs11178998 were identified to have strong genetic 
association with BD in present study though confirmation will require larger 
sample sizes and in additional populations.
