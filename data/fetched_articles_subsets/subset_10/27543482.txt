development of the specific reversal agents for Non-vitamin K Oral 
Anticoagulants (NOACs).
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search strategy to identify 
potential studies on Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane register.

need for the management of major or life threatening bleeds, and the management 
of emergency surgical procedures in patients taking NOACs. It will increase 
confidence in the use of NOACs; thereby extending treatment to a wider range of 
patients.
