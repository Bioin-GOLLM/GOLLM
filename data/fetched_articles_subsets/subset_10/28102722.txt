10.1177/1470320314563425 This article has been retracted at the request of the 
Editors and the Publisher. After conducting a thorough investigation, SAGE found 
that the submitting authors of a number of papers published in the Journal of 
the Renin-Angiotensin Aldosterone System ( JRAAS) (listed below) had supplied 
fabricated contact details for their nominated reviewers. The Editors accepted 
these papers based on the reports supplied by the individuals using these fake 
reviewer email accounts. After concluding that the peer review process was 
therefore seriously compromised, SAGE and the journal Editors have decided to 
retract all affected articles. Online First articles (these articles will not be
