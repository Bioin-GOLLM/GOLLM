Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental 
disorders that emerge during infancy and continue throughout a lifespan. 
Although substantial efforts have been made to develop therapeutic approaches, 
core symptoms persist lifelong in ASD patients. Identifying the brain 
temporospatial regions where the risk genes are expressed in ASD patients may 
help to improve the therapeutic strategies. Accordingly, this work aims to 
predict the risk genes of ASD and identify the temporospatial regions of the 
brain structures at different developmental time points for exploring the 
specificity of ASD gene expression in the brain that would help in possible ASD 
detection in the future. A dataset consisting of 13 developmental stages ranging 
from 8 weeks post-conception to 8 years from 26 brain structures was retrieved 
from the BrainSpan atlas. This work proposes a support vector machine-based risk 
gene prediction method ASD-Risk to distinguish the risk genes of ASD and non-ASD 
genes. ASD-Risk used an optimal feature selection algorithm called inheritable 
bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm to identify the brain 
temporospatial regions for prediction of the risk genes of ASD. ASD-Risk 
achieved a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area 
under a receiver operating characteristic curve, and a test accuracy of 81.83%, 
0.84, 0.79, 0.84, and 72.27%, respectively. We prioritized the temporospatial 
features according to their contribution to the prediction accuracy. The top 
identified temporospatial regions of the brain for risk gene prediction included 
the posteroventral parietal cortex at 13 post-conception weeks feature. The 
identified temporospatial features would help to explore the risk genes that are 
specifically expressed in different brain regions of ASD patients.
