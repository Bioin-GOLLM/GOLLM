OBJECTIVE: A previously reported female diagnosed with type A insulin resistance 
syndrome bearing a heterozygous missense mutation of R1174W in the insulin 
receptor gene was followed for 7 years since the age of 16 years.
METHODS: Five-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were done on baseline, 
the 3(rd), 6(th) and 7(th) year respectively, with serum insulin and C-peptide 
measured at the same time points. Areas under of curve (AUC) of glucose, insulin 
and C-peptide were compared between the years. Acute insulin response (AIR) was 
determined at baseline and the 7(th) year. The dose response were insulin 
secretion rates at each time point during OGTT being plotted over the 
corresponding glucose levels, and the slopes of which quantified the insulin 
secretion responding to glucose.
RESULTS: The follow up data showed that the glucose metabolism of the subject 
did not deteriorate over time with yearly glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
being normal (4.6% - 5.5%), and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was a persistent 
phenomenon observed at 4 - 5 hours post-load. The fasting and AUCs of serum 
insulin and C-peptide tended to decline without simultaneously increase of those 
of plasma glucose. The AIR decreased by 56% as compared to baseline. The dose 
response curves shifted downward as years went by.
CONCLUSIONS: It supports that with the alleviation of physiological insulin 
resistance after puberty, the gross hyperinsulinemia tends to ameliorate, and 
Î²-cell secretion does not deteriorate over time as glucose homeostasis 
maintains.
