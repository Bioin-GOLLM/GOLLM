Occurrence of Colorectal cancer (CRC) is relevant with gut microbiota. However, 
role of IRF3, a key signaling mediator in innate immune sensing, has been barely 
investigated in CRC. Here, we unexpectedly found that the IRF3 deficient mice 
are hyper-susceptible to the development of intestinal tumor in AOM/DSS and 
Apcmin/+ models. Genetic ablation of IRF3 profoundly promotes the proliferation 
of intestinal epithelial cells via aberrantly activating Wnt signaling. 
Mechanically, IRF3 in resting state robustly associates with the active 
β-catenin in the cytoplasm, thus preventing its nuclear translocation and cell 
proliferation, which can be relieved upon microbe-induced activation of IRF3. In 
accordance, the survival of CRC is clinically correlated with the expression 
level of IRF3. Therefore, our study identifies IRF3 as a negative regulator of 
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and a potential prognosis marker for Wnt-related 
tumorigenesis, and describes an intriguing link between gut microbiota and CRC 
via the IRF3-β-catenin axis.
