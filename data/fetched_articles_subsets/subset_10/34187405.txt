BACKGROUND: Heterozygous mutations of the ACAN gene are a major cause of 
different evolutive growth defects in the pediatric population, but were never 
described as a cause of fetal skeletal dysplasia.
CASE PRESENTATION: A G1 at 21w + 3d came to our institution for the 
second-trimester ultrasound and a skeletal dysplasia with prevalent involvement 
of limb's rhizomelic tracts was suspected. Amniocentesis followed by CGH-array 
was performed, with normal results. An examination by NGS of some genes 
associated with skeletal dysplasias showed a novel pathogenic variant of the 
ACAN gene: c.2677delG.
CONCLUSION: Sequence variations of ACAN were never described as a possible cause 
of fetal skeletal anomalies to date. In this case report, we describe the first 
prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia associated with a pathogenic variant of 
ACAN.
