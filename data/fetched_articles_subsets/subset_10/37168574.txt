Immune rejection can be reduced using immunosuppressants which are not viable 
for premature infants. However, desensitization can induce immune tolerance for 
premature infants because of underdeveloped immune system. The fetuses of Wistar 
rats at 15-17 days gestation were injected via hOPCs-1 into brain, muscles, and 
abdomen ex utero and then returned while the fetuses of control without 
injection. After 6 weeks of desensitization, the brain and muscles were 
transplanted with hOPCs-1, hNSCs-1, and hOPCs-2. After 10 and 34 weeks of 
desensitization, hOPCs-1 and hNSCs-1 in desensitized groups was higher than that 
in the control group while hOPCs-2 were rejected. Treg, CD4CD28, CD8CD28, and 
CD45RC between the desensitization and the control group differed significantly. 
Inflammatory cells in group with hOPCs-1 and hNSCs-1 was lower than that in the 
control group. hOPCs-1 can differentiate into myelin in desensitized groups. 
Wistar rats with desensitization developed immune tolerance to desensitized and 
transplanted cells.
