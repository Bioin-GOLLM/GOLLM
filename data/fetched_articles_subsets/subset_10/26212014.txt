The transcription factor Miz1 negatively regulates TNF-induced JNK activation 
and cell death by suppressing TRAF2 K63-polyubiquitination; upon TNF 
stimulation, the suppression is relieved by Mule/ARF-BP1-mediated Miz1 
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. It is not known how Mule is activated 
by TNF. Here we report that TNF activates Mule by inducing the dissociation of 
Mule from its inhibitor ARF. ARF binds to and thereby inhibits the E3 ligase 
activity of Mule in the steady state. TNF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of 
Mule, which subsequently dissociates from ARF and becomes activated. Inhibition 
of Mule phosphorylation by silencing of the Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk) 
prevents its dissociation from ARF, thereby inhibiting Mule E3 ligase activity 
and TNF-induced JNK activation and cell death. Our data provides a missing link 
in TNF signaling pathway that leads to JNK activation and cell death.
