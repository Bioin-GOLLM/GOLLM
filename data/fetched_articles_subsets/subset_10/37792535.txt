The melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) is a negative regulator of the central 
melanocortin circuitry via presynaptic expression on agouti-related protein 
(AgRP) nerve terminals, from where it regulates GABA release onto secondary 
MC4R-expressing neurons. However, MC3R knockout (KO) mice also exhibit defective 
behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to fasting. Here, we demonstrate that 
MC3R KO mice exhibit defective activation of AgRP neurons in response to 
fasting, cold exposure, or ghrelin while exhibiting normal inhibition of AgRP 
neurons by sensory detection of food in the ad libitum-fed state. Using a 
conditional MC3R KO model, we show that the control of AgRP neuron activation by 
fasting and ghrelin requires the specific presence of MC3R within AgRP neurons. 
Thus, MC3R is a crucial player in the responsiveness of the AgRP soma to both 
hormonal and neuronal signals of energy need.
