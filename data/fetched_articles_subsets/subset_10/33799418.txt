Differential usage of Kat3 coactivators, CBP and p300, by β-catenin is a 
fundamental regulatory mechanism in stem cell maintenance and initiation of 
differentiation and repair. Based upon our earlier pharmacologic studies, p300 
serine 89 (S89) is critical for controlling differential coactivator usage by 
β-catenin via post-translational phosphorylation in stem/progenitor populations, 
and appears to be a target for a number of kinase cascades. To further 
investigate mechanisms of signal integration effected by this domain, we 
generated p300 S89A knock-in mice. We show that S89A mice are extremely 
sensitive to intestinal insult resulting in colitis, which is known to 
significantly increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer. We demonstrate 
cell intrinsic differences, and microbiome compositional differences and 
differential immune responses, in intestine of S89A versus wild type mice. 
Genomic and proteomic analyses reveal pathway differences, including lipid 
metabolism, oxidative stress response, mitochondrial function and oxidative 
phosphorylation. The diverse effects on fundamental processes including 
epithelial differentiation, metabolism, immune response and microbiome 
colonization, all brought about by a single amino acid modification S89A, 
highlights the critical role of this region in p300 as a signaling nexus and the 
rationale for conservation of this residue and surrounding region for hundreds 
of million years of vertebrate evolution.
