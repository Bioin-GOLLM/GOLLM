Fms-like tyrosine-like kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) is 
present in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 30% of patients and is associated 
with short disease-free survival. FLT3 inhibitor efficacy is limited and 
transient but may be enhanced by multitargeting of FLT3-ITD signaling pathways. 
FLT3-ITD drives both STAT5-dependent transcription of oncogenic Pim-1 kinase and 
inactivation of the tumor-suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and 
FLT3-ITD, Pim-1, and PP2A all regulate the c-Myc oncogene. We studied mechanisms 
of action of cotreatment of FLT3-ITD-expressing cells with FLT3 inhibitors and 
PP2A-activating drugs (PADs), which are in development. PADs, including FTY720 
and DT-061, enhanced FLT3 inhibitor growth suppression and apoptosis induction 
in FLT3-ITD-expressing cell lines and primary AML cells in vitro and MV4-11 
growth suppression in vivo PAD and FLT3 inhibitor cotreatment independently 
downregulated c-Myc and Pim-1 protein through enhanced proteasomal degradation. 
c-Myc and Pim-1 downregulation was preceded by AKT inactivation, did not occur 
in cells expressing myristoylated (constitutively active) AKT1, and could be 
induced by AKT inhibition. AKT inactivation resulted in activation of GSK-3β, 
and GSK-3β inhibition blocked downregulation of both c-Myc and Pim-1 by PAD and 
FLT3 inhibitor cotreatment. GSK-3β activation increased c-Myc proteasomal 
degradation through c-Myc phosphorylation on T58; infection with c-Myc with T58A 
substitution, preventing phosphorylation, blocked downregulation of c-Myc by PAD 
and FLT3 inhibitor cotreatment. GSK-3β also phosphorylated Pim-1L/Pim-1S on 
S95/S4. Thus, PADs enhance efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-ITD-expressing 
cells through a novel mechanism involving AKT inhibition-dependent 
GSK-3β-mediated increased c-Myc and Pim-1 proteasomal degradation.
