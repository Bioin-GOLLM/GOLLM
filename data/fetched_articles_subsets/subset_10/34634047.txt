The identification of antibody variable regions in the heavy (VH) and light (VL) 
chains from hybridomas is necessary for the production of recombinant, 
sequence-defined monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody derivatives. This 
process has received renewed attention in light of recent reports of hybridomas 
having unintended specificities due to the production of non-antigen specific 
heavy and/or light chains for the intended antigen. Here we report a surprising 
finding and potential pitfall in variable domain sequencing of an anti-human 
CD63 hybridoma. We amplified multiple VL genes from the hybridoma cDNA, 
including the well-known aberrant Sp2/0 myeloma VK and a unique, full-length VL. 
After finding that the unique VL failed to yield a functional antibody, we 
discovered an additional full-length sequence with surprising similarity (~95% 
sequence identify) to the non-translated myeloma kappa chain but with a 
correction of its key frameshift mutation. Expression of the recombinant mAb 
confirmed that this highly homologous sequence is the antigen-specific light 
chain. Our results highlight the complexity of PCR-based cloning of antibody 
genes and strategies useful for identification of correct sequences.
