Epitope tagging is a powerful strategy for analyzing the functions of targeted 
proteins. The use of this strategy has become more convenient with the 
development of the epitope switch, which is another type of epitope tagging 
designed to convert the previously tagged epitopes on the chromosome to other 
epitopes of interest. Various modules for C-terminal epitope switching have been 
developed and amplified using the one-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
method before transformation. However, PCR amplification occasionally generates 
mutations that affect the fidelity of epitope switching. Here, we constructed 
several plasmids to isolate modules for epitope switching through digestion by 
restriction enzymes. The isolated modules contained DNA sequences for homologous 
recombination, various epitopes (13×Myc, 6×HA, GFP, Venus, YFP, mCherry, and 
CFP), and a transformation marker (Candida glabrata LEU2). The restriction 
enzyme-digested plasmids were used to directly transform the cells for epitope 
switching. We demonstrate the efficient and accurate switching of the MX6 
module-based C-terminal tandem affinity purification tags to each aforementioned 
epitope. We believe that our plasmids can serve as powerful tools for the 
functional analysis of yeast proteins.
