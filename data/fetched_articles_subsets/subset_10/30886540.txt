A system is described which permits the efficient synthesis of proteins in vitro 
at high temperature. It is based on the use of an unfractionated cell lysate 
(S30) from Sulfolobus solfataricus previously well characterized in our 
laboratory for translation of pretranscribed mRNAs, and now adapted to perform 
coupled transcription and translation. The essential element in this expression 
system is a strong promoter derived from the S. solfataricus 16S/23S 
rRNA-encoding gene, from which specific mRNAs may be transcribed with high 
efficiency. The synthesis of two different proteins is reported, including the 
S. solfataricus DNA-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyl-transferase protein (SsOGT), which is 
shown to be successfully labeled with appropriate fluorescent substrates and 
visualized in cell extracts. The simplicity of the experimental procedure and 
specific activity of the proteins offer a number of possibilities for the study 
of structure-function relationships of proteins.
