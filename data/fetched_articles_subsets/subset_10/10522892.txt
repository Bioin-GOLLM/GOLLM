Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) linked to the E200K mutation of the prion 
protein (PrP) gene presents within a wide range of phenotypic heterogeneity, 
including the age at disease onset. We report an earlier disease onset for 
mutation carriers of the offspring generation when compared with that of their 
parents, suggesting the possibility of anticipation. A still unidentified 
environmental or genetic element may affect the age at onset in mutation 
carriers of different generations.
