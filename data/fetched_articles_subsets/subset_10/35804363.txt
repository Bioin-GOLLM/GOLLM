BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a diffuse parenchymal lung 
disease characterized by exuberant deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) 
proteins in the lung interstitium, which contributes to substantial morbidity 
and mortality in IPF patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a large 
family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, many of which have been implicated in 
the regulation of ECM degradation in lung fibrosis. However, the roles of MMP-2 
and -9 (also termed gelatinases A and B) have not yet been explored in lung 
fibrosis in detail.
METHODS: AdTGF-β1 was applied via orotracheal routes to the lungs of WT, MMP-2 
KO, MMP-9 KO and MMP-2/-9 dKO mice on day 0 to induce lung fibrosis. Using 
hydroxyproline assay, FlexiVent based lung function measurement, histopathology, 
western blot and ELISA techniques, we analyzed MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels in BAL 
fluid and lung, collagen contents in lung and lung function in mice on day 14 
and 21 post-treatment.
RESULT: IPF lung homogenates exhibited significantly increased levels of MMP-2 
and MMP-9, relative to disease controls. Enzymatically active MMP-2 and MMP-9 
was increased in lungs of mice exposed to adenoviral TGF-β1, suggesting a role 
for these metalloproteinases in lung fibrogenesis. However, we found that 
neither MMP-2 or MMP-9 nor combined MMP-2/-9 deletion had any effect on 
experimental lung fibrosis in mice.
CONCLUSION: Together, our data strongly suggest that both gelatinases MMP-2 and 
MMP-9 play only a subordinate role in experimental lung fibrosis in mice.
