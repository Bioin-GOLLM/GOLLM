BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is considered to be a rare disease in Asians. 
We report two cases of CF in a 5-year-old girl and her newborn brother. They are 
of mixed parentage: a Taiwanese mother and an Australian father.
METHODS: A comprehensive mutational analysis of the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene was completed. Literature was 
reviewed for delta F508 in East Asians.
RESULTS: Two mutation sites were identified in the siblings. The carrier status 
of their parents and elder brother were also confirmed: heterozygous delta F508 
mutation from the father; 13 TG repeats in the IVS8-5T from the mother. An 
update of delta F508 mutation reported in East Asian patients from various 
ethnicities is included; most of them were of mixed parentage.
CONCLUSION: These two cases are the first report of cystic fibrosis associated 
with a delta F508 mutation in a Taiwanese patient attributable to a mutation 
most commonly seen in Caucasians. We found that the delta F508 mutation is of 
western origin. Asian patients are seldom found with this mutation unless they 
are of mixed parentage. Our findings provide further evidence that different 
ethnicities have their own set of CFTR mutations.
