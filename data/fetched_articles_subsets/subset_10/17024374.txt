Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EvC) is caused by mutations in EVC and EVC2, genes 
in a divergent orientation separated by only 2.6 kb. We systematically sought 
mutations in both genes in a panel of 65 affected individuals to assess the 
proportion of cases resulting from mutations in each gene. We PCR amplified and 
sequenced the coding exons of both genes. We investigated mutations that could 
affect splicing by in vitro splicing assays and cDNA analysis. We have 
identified EVC mutations in 20 cases (31%); in all of these we have detected the 
mutation on each allele. We have identified EVC2 mutations in 25 cases (38%); in 
22 of these we have isolated a mutation on each allele. The majority of the 
mutations introduce a premature termination codon. We sequenced the region 
between the two genes in 10 of the 20 cases in which we had not identified a 
mutation in either gene, revealing only one SNP that was not a common 
polymorphism. As we have not identified mutations in either gene in 20 cases 
(31%) it is possible that there is further genetic heterogeneity.
