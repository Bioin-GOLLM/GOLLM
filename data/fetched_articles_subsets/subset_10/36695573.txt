Skeletal muscle exhibits remarkable plasticity in response to environmental 
cues, with stress-dependent effects on the fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers. 
Although stress-induced gene expression underlies environmental adaptation, it 
is unclear how transcriptional and epigenetic factors regulate fiber 
type-specific responses in the muscle. Here, we show that flavin-dependent 
lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) differentially controls responses to 
glucocorticoid and exercise in postnatal skeletal muscle. Using skeletal 
muscle-specific LSD1-knockout mice and in vitro approaches, we found that LSD1 
loss exacerbated glucocorticoid-induced atrophy in the fast fiber-dominant 
muscles, with reduced nuclear retention of Foxk1, an anti-autophagic 
transcription factor. Furthermore, LSD1 depletion enhanced endurance 
exercise-induced hypertrophy in the slow fiber-dominant muscles, by induced 
expression of ERRγ, a transcription factor that promotes oxidative metabolism 
genes. Thus, LSD1 serves as an 'epigenetic barrier' that optimizes fiber 
type-specific responses and muscle mass under the stress conditions. Our results 
uncover that LSD1 modulators provide emerging therapeutic and preventive 
strategies against stress-induced myopathies such as sarcopenia, cachexia, and 
disuse atrophy.
