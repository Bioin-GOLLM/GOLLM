Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown significant therapeutic responses 
against tumors containing increased mutation-associated neoantigen load. We have 
examined the evolving landscape of tumor neoantigens during the emergence of 
acquired resistance in patients with non-small cell lung cancer after initial 
response to immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 
antibodies. Analyses of matched pretreatment and resistant tumors identified 
genomic changes resulting in loss of 7 to 18 putative mutation-associated 
neoantigens in resistant clones. Peptides generated from the eliminated 
neoantigens elicited clonal T-cell expansion in autologous T-cell cultures, 
suggesting that they generated functional immune responses. Neoantigen loss 
occurred through elimination of tumor subclones or through deletion of 
chromosomal regions containing truncal alterations, and was associated with 
changes in T-cell receptor clonality. These analyses provide insight into the 
dynamics of mutational landscapes during immune checkpoint blockade and have 
implications for the development of immune therapies that target tumor 
neoantigens.Significance: Acquired resistance to immune checkpoint therapy is 
being recognized more commonly. This work demonstrates for the first time that 
acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade can arise in association with 
the evolving landscape of mutations, some of which encode tumor neoantigens 
recognizable by T cells. These observations imply that widening the breadth of 
neoantigen reactivity may mitigate the development of acquired resistance.
