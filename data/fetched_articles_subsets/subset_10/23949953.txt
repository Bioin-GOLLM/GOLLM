We report on a female patient with an exceedingly rare combination of 
achondroplasia and multiple-suture craniosynostosis. Besides the specific 
features of achondroplasia, synostosis of the metopic, coronal, lambdoid, and 
squamosal sutures was found. Series of neurosurgical interventions were carried 
out, principally for acrocephaly and posterior plagiocephaly. The most common 
achondroplasia mutation, a p.Gly380Arg in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 
3 (FGFR3) gene, was detected. Cytogenetic and array CGH analyses, as well as 
molecular genetic testing of FGFR1, 2, 3 and TWIST1 genes failed to identify any 
additional genetic alteration. It is suggested that this unusual phenotype is a 
result of variable expressivity of the common achondroplasia mutation.
