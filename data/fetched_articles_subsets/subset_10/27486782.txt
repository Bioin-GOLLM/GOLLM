Circulating blood cell counts and indices are important indicators of 
hematopoietic function and a number of clinical parameters, such as blood 
oxygen-carrying capacity, inflammation, and hemostasis. By performing 
whole-exome sequence association analyses of hematologic quantitative traits in 
15,459 community-dwelling individuals, followed by in silico replication in up 
to 52,024 independent samples, we identified two previously undescribed coding 
variants associated with lower platelet count: a common missense variant in CPS1 
(rs1047891, MAF = 0.33, discovery + replication p = 6.38 × 10(-10)) and a rare 
synonymous variant in GFI1B (rs150813342, MAF = 0.009, discovery + replication p 
= 1.79 × 10(-27)). By performing CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in hematopoietic 
cell lines and follow-up targeted knockdown experiments in primary human 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we demonstrate an alternative splicing 
mechanism by which the GFI1B rs150813342 variant suppresses formation of a GFI1B 
isoform that preferentially promotes megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet 
production. These results demonstrate how unbiased studies of natural variation 
in blood cell traits can provide insight into the regulation of human 
hematopoiesis.
