Osimertinib, a new-generation inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor, has been 
used for the clinical treatment of advanced T790M mutation-positive tumors. In 
this research, an original analysis method was established for the 
quantification of osimertinib by ultra-performance liquid chromatography with 
time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS) in rat plasma. After protein 
precipitation with acetonitrile and sorafinib (internal standard, IS), they were 
chromatographed through a Waters XTerra MS C18 column. The mobile phase was 
acetonitrile and water (including 0.1% ammonia). The relative standard deviation 
(RSD) of the intra- and inter-day results ranged from 5.38 to 9.76% and from 
6.02 to 9.46%, respectively, and the extraction recovery and matrix effects were 
calculated to range from 84.31 to 96.14% and from 91.46 to 97.18%, respectively. 
The results illustrated that the analysis method had sufficient specificity, 
accuracy and precision. Meanwhile, the UPLC-TOF-MS method for osimertinib was 
successfully applied into the pharmacokinetics of SD rats.
