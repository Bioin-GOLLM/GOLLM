The past two decades witnessed a revolution in our understanding of 
host-microbiota interactions that led to the concept of the super-organism 
consisting of a eukaryotic part and a prokaryotic part. Owing to the critical 
role of gut microbiota in modulating the host immune system, it is not beyond 
all expectations that more and more evidence indicated that the shift of gut 
microbiota influenced responses to numerous forms of cancer immunotherapy. 
Therapy targeting gut microbiota is becoming a promising strategy to improve 
cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the role of the gut microbiota 
in response to cancer immunotherapy, the mechanisms that the gut microbiota 
influences cancer immunotherapy, and therapeutic strategies targeting gut 
microbiota to improve cancer immunotherapy.
