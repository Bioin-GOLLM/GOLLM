We report the clinical presentation and genetic screening of 2 patients with 
thoracic aortic aneurysms. A novel TGFBR2 mutation in the 5'untranslated region 
(c.-59C>T) was identified in a 31-year-old man with a Stanford type A aortic 
dissection. Bioinformatics tools showed that c.-59C>T variant was predicted to 
affect exonic splicing enhancer, as validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, 
revealing a sixfold increase of TGFBR2 mRNA in aneurysmal aortic tissue 
collected during surgery. A previously described missense mutation, p.E239K, in 
the SMAD3 gene was identified in a 60-year-old man who presented with diffuse 
vasculopathy. These findings suggest that the features of aneurysmal disease 
extending beyond the ascending aorta may help to target SMAD3 genetic screening 
and that alterations in the core splicing machinery can contribute to aneurysmal 
disease.
