The molecular features of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), including its increased 
incidence, and complex therapies have not been investigated in detail, 
particularly in East Asian populations. In this study, we performed targeted 
panel sequencing (TPS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) to investigate the 
genetic alterations in Korean MCL patients. We obtained a total of 53 samples 
from MCL patients from five Korean university hospitals between 2009 and 2016. 
We identified the recurrently mutated genes such as SYNE1, ATM, KMT2D, CARD11, 
ANK2, KMT2C, and TP53, which included some known drivers of MCL. The mutational 
profiles of our cohort indicated genetic heterogeneity. The significantly 
enriched pathways were mainly involved in gene expression, cell cycle, and 
programmed cell death. Multivariate analysis revealed that ANK2 mutations 
impacted the unfavourable overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 3.126; P = 0.032). 
Furthermore, TP53 mutations were related to worse progression-free survival (HR 
7.813; P = 0.043). Among the recurrently mutated genes with more than 15.0% 
frequency, discrepancies were found in only 5 genes from 4 patients, suggesting 
comparability of the TPS to WES in practical laboratory settings. We provide the 
unbiased genetic landscape that might contribute to MCL pathogenesis and 
recurrent genes conferring unfavourable outcomes.
