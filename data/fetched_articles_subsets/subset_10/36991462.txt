BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) play 
crucial roles in regulating various physiological and pathological processes. 
However, the role of lncRNAs and mRNAs in mediating the liver response during 
Toxocara canis infection remains incompletely understood.
METHODS: In the present study, the expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs was 
investigated in the liver of Beagle dogs infected by T. canis using 
high-throughput RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Compared with the control groups, 876 differentially expressed (DE) 
lncRNAs and 288 DEmRNAs were identified at 12 h post-infection (hpi), 906 
DElncRNAs and 261 DEmRNAs were identified at 24 hpi, and 876 DElncRNAs and 302 
DEmRNAs were identified at 36 days post-infection (dpi). A total of 16 DEmRNAs 
(e.g. dpp4, crp and gnas) were commonly identified at the three infection 
stages. Enrichment and co-localization analyses identified several pathways 
involved in immune and inflammatory responses during T. canis infection. Some 
novel DElncRNAs, such as LNC_015756, LNC_011050 and LNC_011052, were also 
associated with immune and inflammatory responses. Also, LNC_005105 and 
LNC_005401 were associated with the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, 
which may play a role in the healing of liver pathology at the late stage of 
infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data provided new insight into the regulatory roles of lncRNAs 
and mRNAs in the pathogenesis of T. canis and improved our understanding of the 
contribution of lncRNAs and mRNAs to the immune and inflammatory response of the 
liver during T. canis infection.
