Tigecycline is regarded as a last-resort treatment for carbapenem-resistant 
Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections, but increasing numbers of 
tigecycline-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates have been reported. The tigecycline 
resistance mechanisms in CRKP are undetermined. This study aimed to elucidate 
the mechanisms underlying tigecycline resistance in 16 tigecycline- and 
carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (TCRKP) isolates. Mutations in tigecycline 
resistance determinant genes [ramR, acrR, oqxR, tet(A), tet(L), tet(X), tet(M), 
rpsJ] were assessed by PCR amplicon sequencing, and mutations in ramR and tet(A) 
exhibited high prevalences individually (81%) and in combination (63%). Eight 
functional ramR mutation profiles reducing tigecycline sensitivity were verified 
by plasmid complementation of wild-type and mutant ramR Using a site-specific 
mutant, the most frequent RamR mutation, A19V (60%), had no significant effect 
on tigecycline susceptibility or the upregulation of ramA and acrA Two tet(A) 
variants with double frameshift mutations, type 1 and type 2, were identified; 
type 2 tet(A) is novel. A parent strain transformed with a plasmid carrying type 
1 or type 2 tet(A) increased the tigecycline MIC by 8-fold or 4-fold, 
respectively. Synergistic effects were observed in strains harboring no ramR 
gene and a mutated tet(A), with an 8-fold increase in the tigecycline MIC 
compared with that in strains harboring only mutated tet(A) being seen. Overall, 
mutations in the ramR and tet(A) efflux genes constituted the major tigecycline 
resistance mechanisms among the studied TCRKP isolates. The identification of 
strains exhibiting the combination of a ramR deficiency and widespread mutated 
tet(A) is concerning due to the possible dissemination of increased tigecycline 
resistance in K. pneumoniae.
