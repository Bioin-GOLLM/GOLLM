PURPOSE: In this study, we investigated the prevalence of CD79B and MYD88 
mutations and their relation to clinical characteristics in a cohort of Chinese 
patients with primary testicular diffuse large B cell lymphoma (PT-DLBCL).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the mutational status of CD79B and MYD88 by 
Sanger sequencing, and the gene amplification and protein expression of MYD88 in 
tissue samples from 30 cases of PT-DLBCL by quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Western blotting was used to 
analyze phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) protein 
expression in cell lines harboring retroviral constructs for WT MYD88 or MYD88 
mutant.
RESULTS: Immunophenotypically, MYD88 protein staining was positive in 26/30 
(86.67%) cases, and 23/30 (76.7%) cases tested positive for p65 in the nucleus. 
Genetically, CD79B mutation was found in 13/30 (43.3%) cases, whereas the MYD88 
L265P mutation was found in 18/30 (60.0%) cases. Interestingly, CD79B and MYD88 
mutations were more prevalent in the non-germinal center B cell (GCB) subtype 
(83.3% and 76.9%, respectively) and were relatively rare in the GCB subtype 
(16.7% and 23.1%, respectively). Furthermore, although MYD88 was significantly 
amplified in PT-DLBCL, the amplification status showed no correlation with its 
mutational status and protein expression. Clinicopathological comparison between 
the mutant and wild-type group showed that both CD79B mutation and MYD88 L265P 
were not significantly correlated with age, anatomical site, Ann Arbor stage, 
non-GCB/GCB subtype, p65 protein expression, BCL-2 protein expression, or 
BCL-2/c-MYC double expression (P>0.05). Survival analyses showed that high IPI 
and advanced stage (stage III-IV) associated with worse outcome (P<0.05). The 
expression of p-STAT3 and p-p65 protein was upregulated in the mutant group, 
indicating that MYD88 mutant activated NF-κB and JAK-STAT3 signaling.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that MYD88 and CD79B mutations are important 
drivers of immune-privileged site-associated DLBCL and highlight potential 
therapeutic targets for personalized treatment.
