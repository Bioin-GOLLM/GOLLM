Beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2 M) is a low molecular weight protein filtered by 
the renal glomerulus, then reabsorbed and metabolized at the proximal tubule. 
Its blood concentration is a good renal index, as it is independent from muscle 
mass and diet contrary to creatinine. We assayed serum beta 2 M in 190 cases of 
diabetes mellitus divided into 71 non-insulin-dependent and 119 
insulin-dependent forms. We found no significant difference between both groups. 
Serum beta 2 M was not correlated with Hb A 1 C. Conversely, a highly 
significant positive correlation between beta 2 M and serum creatinine and a 
negative correlation between beta 2 M and creatinine clearance were 
demonstrated. Furthermore, patients with borderline serum creatinine and those 
with normal renal function show very significant differences in mean serum beta 
2 M concentrations, thus making combined assay of both parameters advisable. On 
the other hand, we were unable to evaluate modifications in beta 2 M according 
to other complications of diabetes mellitus as vascular and neurologic 
involvement are very often associated with renal dysfunction.
