Proteinases and their inhibitors play essential functional roles in basic 
biological processes in both hosts and pathogens. Endo/lysosomal cathepsins 
participate in immune response in pathogen recognition and elimination. They are 
essential for both antigen processing and presentation (host adaptive immune 
response) and activation of endosomal Toll like receptors (innate immune 
response). Pathogens can produce proteases and also natural inhibitors to 
subvert the host immune response. Several pathogens are sensed through the 
intracellular pathogen recognition receptors, but only some of them use the host 
proteolytic system to escape into the cytosol. In this review, I provide an 
update on the most recent developments regarding the role of proteinases and 
their inhibitors in the initiation and regulation of immune responses.
