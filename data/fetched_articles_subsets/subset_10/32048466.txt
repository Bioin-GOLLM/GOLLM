BACKGROUND: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is one major cause of female 
infertility, minichromosome maintenance complex component 8 (MCM8) has been 
reported to be responsible for POI.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify the genetic variants 
of women with POI. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the variants in all 
the family members. Various bioinformatic software was used for the 
pathogenicity assessment. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR), real-time quantitative PCR, and a chromosomal instability study 
induced by mitomycin C were performed to analyze the functional effects of the 
variant.
RESULTS: A novel homozygous frameshift mutation (NM_032485.4:c.351_354delAAAG) 
of MCM8 gene was identified in the patients, segregated with POI in this family. 
This mutation is predicted to produce truncated MCM8 protein and to be 
pathogenic. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the 
frameshift mutation led to a remarkably reduced level of MCM8 transcript 
products, and chromosomal instability study showed that the ability of mutant 
MCM8 to repair DNA breaks was impaired.
CONCLUSION: We identified a novel homozygous frameshift mutation in the MCM8 
gene in two affected sisters with POI, and functional analysis revealed that 
this mutation is pathogenic. Our findings enrich the MCM8 mutation spectrum and 
might help clinicians to make a precise diagnosis, thereby allowing better 
family planning and genetic counseling.
