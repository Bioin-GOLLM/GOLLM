Two polymorphic variants of the ECH1 gene product protein 
(delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-coenzyme A isomerase) have been revealed by 
proteomics methods in samples of human striated muscle tissue. These variants 
are identical in molecular weight (29.7 kD) but different in pI values (6.57 and 
6.75) and in amino acid substitution (41 E-->A) confirmed by mass spectrometry. 
The same type of polymorphism has been detected in samples of different tissues 
of the same person, so these variants are considered (also based on other data) 
to be allelic. The rates of these alleles in two representative cohorts of 
Moscow and Minsk residents are similar.
