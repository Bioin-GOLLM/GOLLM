Fanconi anaemia is an autosomal recessive disease for which four known 
complementation groups exist. Recently, the gene defective in complementation 
group C (FACC) has been cloned. In order to determine the fraction of Fanconi 
anaemia caused by FACC mutations, we used reverse transcription PCR and chemical 
mismatch cleavage (CMC) to examine the FACC cDNA in 17 FA cell lines. 4/17 
patients (23.5%) had mutations in this gene. Two Ashkenazi-Jewish individuals 
were homozygous for an identical splice mutation. Three additional Jewish 
patients bearing this allele were found upon screening 21 other families. We 
conclude that a common mutation in FACC accounts for the majority of Fanconi 
anaemia in Ashkenazi-Jewish families.
