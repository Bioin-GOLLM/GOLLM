INTRODUCTION: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis of the medium- and 
large-sized arteries. Interferon type I (IFN-I) is increasingly recognized as a 
key player in autoimmune diseases and might be involved in GCA pathogenesis, 
however evidence is limited. IFN-I activates Janus kinase/signal transducers and 
activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathways, leading to increased expression 
of interferon stimulated genes. In this study, IFN-I activity in GCA is 
explored, focusing on CD8+ T cells.
METHODS: Expression of phospho-STAT (pSTAT) 1, 3 and 5 was investigated in 
IFN-α-stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) gated separately for CD8+ 
T cells of patients with GCA (n=18), healthy controls (HC, n=15) and infection 
controls (n=11) by Phosphoflow method combined with fluorescent cell barcoding 
technique. Furthermore, IFN-I induced myxovirus-resistance protein A (MxA) and 
CD8+ T cell expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry in temporal 
artery biopsies (TAB) of GCA patients (n=20) and mimics (n=20), and in aorta 
tissue of GCA (n=8) and atherosclerosis patients (n=14).
RESULTS: pSTAT1 expression was increased in IFN-α stimulated CD8+ T cells from 
GCA patients, whereas no difference was observed in pSTAT3 and pSTAT5 
expression. MxA was present in TABs of 13/20 GCA patients compared to 2/20 
mimics and in 8/8 GCA+ compared to 13/14 GCA- aorta tissues. MxA location 
partially co-localized with CD8+T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for increased IFN-I activity in CD8+ T 
cells of GCA patients, both systemically and locally. These findings warrant 
further investigation regarding IFN-I induced biomarkers and IFN-I related novel 
therapeutic options in GCA.
