This review's objectives are to provide an overview of the various kinds of 
biopolymer hydrogels that are currently used for bone tissue and periodontal 
tissue regeneration, to list the advantages and disadvantages of using them, to 
assess how well they might be used for nanoscale fabrication and 
biofunctionalization, and to describe their production processes and processes 
for functionalization with active biomolecules. They are applied in conjunction 
with other materials (such as microparticles (MPs) and nanoparticles (NPs)) and 
other novel techniques to replicate physiological bone generation more 
faithfully. Enhancing the biocompatibility of hydrogels created from blends of 
natural and synthetic biopolymers can result in the creation of the best 
scaffold match to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for bone and periodontal tissue 
regeneration. Additionally, adding various nanoparticles can increase the 
scaffold hydrogel stability and provide a number of biological effects. In this 
review, the research study of polysaccharide hydrogel as a scaffold will be 
critical in creating valuable materials for effective bone tissue regeneration, 
with a future impact predicted in repairing bone defects.
