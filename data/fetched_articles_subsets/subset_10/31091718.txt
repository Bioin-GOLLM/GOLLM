We previously identified a novel syndrome in patients characterized by 
paraganglioma, somatostatinoma, and polycythemia. In these patients, 
polycythemia occurs long before any tumor develops, and tumor removal only 
partially corrects polycythemia, with recurrence occurring shortly after 
surgery. Genetic mosaicism of gain-of-function mutations of the EPAS1 gene 
(encoding HIF2α) located in the oxygen degradation domain (ODD), typically 
p.530-532, was shown as the etiology of this syndrome. The aim of the present 
investigation was to demonstrate that these mutations are necessary and 
sufficient for the development of the symptoms. We developed transgenic mice 
with a gain-of-function Epas1A529V mutation (corresponding to human EPAS1A530V), 
which demonstrated elevated levels of erythropoietin and polycythemia, a 
decreased urinary metanephrine-to-normetanephrine ratio, and increased 
expression of somatostatin in the ampullary region of duodenum. Further, 
inhibition of HIF2α with its specific inhibitor PT2385 significantly reduced 
erythropoietin levels in the mutant mice. However, polycythemia persisted after 
PT2385 treatment, suggesting an alternative erythropoietin-independent mechanism 
of polycythemia. These findings demonstrate the vital roles of EPAS1 mutations 
in the syndrome development and the great potential of the Epas1A529V animal 
model for further pathogenesis and therapeutics studies.
