Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials have been fabricated from diverse 
materials such as conductive polymers, carbon based nanostructures and magnetic 
metal oxides. Nevertheless, it has remained a great challenge to develop 
lightweight and high-efficiency EM wave absorbing materials with a broad 
frequency range. Herein, we report a scalable strategy to create Co3O4/carbon 
composite nanofibrous membrane by electrospinning technique followed by 
stabilization and carbonization processes. An optimal reflection loss (RL) value 
of 36.27 dB is reached at 13.76 GHz for a layer of 2 mm thickness. RL exceeding 
-20 dB can be realized in any interval within the 4.5-14.4 GHz range by 
selecting a proper thickness of the absorbing layer between 1 and 5 mm. The 
Co3O4/carbon composite nanofibrous membrane could be well served as promising 
and attractive candidates for lightweight and enhanced EM wave absorbing 
materials. This presented research provides an innovative and effective approach 
to design the novel EM wave absorbing material in a broad frequency range for 
practical applications.
