BACKGROUND: Recent developments in abscopal effect strongly support the use of 
radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. However, deeper 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the abscopal effect are 
required to best benefit a larger proportion of patients with metastasis. 
Several groups including ours, reported the involvement of wild-type (wt) p53 in 
radiation-induced abscopal effects, however very little is known on the role of 
wtp53 dependent molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: We investigated through in vivo and in vitro approaches how wtp53 
orchestrates radiation-induced abscopal effects. Wtp53 bearing (A549) and 
p53-null (H1299) NSCLC lines were xenotransplanted in nude mice, and cultured in 
2D monolayers and 3D tumor spheroids. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated 
from medium cell culture by ultracentrifugation protocol followed by 
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. Gene expression was evaluated by RT-Real Time, 
digital qRT-PCR, and dot blot technique. Protein levels were determined by 
immunohistochemistry, confocal anlysis, western blot techniques, and 
immunoassay.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that single high-dose irradiation (20 Gy) induces 
significant tumor growth inhibition in contralateral non-irradiated (NIR) A549 
xenograft tumors but not in NIR p53-null H1299 or p53-silenced A549 (A549sh/p53) 
xenografts. We further demonstrates that irradiation of A549 cells in vitro 
induces a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) producing 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) expressing CD63 and carrying DNA:RNA hybrids and 
LINE-1 retrotransposon. IR-A549 EVs also hamper the colony-forming capability of 
recipient NIR A549 cells, induce senescent phenotype, nuclear expression of 
DNA:RNA hybrids, and M1 macrophage polarization.
CONCLUSIONS: In our models, we demonstrate that high radiation dose in wtp53 
tumors induce the onset of SASP and secretion of CD63+ EVs loaded with DNA:RNA 
hybrids and LINE-1 retrotransposons that convey senescence messages out of the 
irradiation field triggering abscopal effect in NIR tumors.
