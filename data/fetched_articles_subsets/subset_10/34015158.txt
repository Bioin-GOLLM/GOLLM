Understanding the role of common polymorphisms in modulating the clinical 
phenotype when they co-occur with a disease-causing lesion is of critical 
importance in medical genetics. We explored the impact of apparently neutral 
common polymorphisms, using the gene encoding the urea cycle enzyme, ornithine 
transcarbamylase (OTC), as a model system. Distinct combinations of genetic 
backgrounds embracing two missense polymorphisms were created in cis with the 
pathogenic p.Arg40His replacement. In vitro enzymatic assays revealed that the 
polymorphic variants were able to modulate OTC activity both in the presence or 
absence of the pathogenic lesion. First, we found that the combination of the 
minor alleles of polymorphisms p.Lys46Arg and p.Gln270Arg significantly enhanced 
enzymatic activity in the wild-type protein. Second, enzymatic assays revealed 
that the minor allele of the p.Gln270Arg polymorphism was capable of 
ameliorating OTC activity when combined in cis with the pathogenic p.Arg40His 
replacement. Structural analysis predicted that the minor allele of the 
p.Gln270Arg polymorphism would serve to stabilize the OTC wild-type protein, 
thereby corroborating the results of the experimental assays. Our findings 
demonstrate the potential importance of cis-interactions between common 
polymorphic variants and pathogenic missense mutations and illustrate how 
standing genetic variation can modulate protein function.
