Accumulating evidence suggests that viruses play an important role in the 
development of diabetes. Although the diabetogenic encephalomyocarditis strain D 
virus induces diabetes in restricted lines of inbred mice, the susceptibility 
genes to virus-induced diabetes have not been identified. We report here that 
novel Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) gene mutations are present in virus-induced 
diabetes-sensitive SJL and SWR mice. Mice carrying the mutant Tyk2 gene on the 
virus-resistant C57BL/6 background are highly sensitive to virus-induced 
diabetes. Tyk2 gene expression is strongly reduced in Tyk2-mutant mice, 
associated with low Tyk2 promoter activity, and leads to decreased expression of 
interferon-inducible genes, resulting in significantly compromised antiviral 
response. Tyk2-mutant pancreatic β-cells are unresponsive even to high dose of 
Type I interferon. Reversal of virus-induced diabetes could be achieved by 
β-cell-specific Tyk2 gene expression. Thus, reduced Tyk2 gene expression in 
pancreatic β-cells due to natural mutation is responsible for susceptibility to 
virus-induced diabetes.
