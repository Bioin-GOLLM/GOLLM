Spire and Cappuccino are actin nucleation factors that are required to establish 
the polarity of Drosophila melanogaster oocytes. Their mutant phenotypes are 
nearly identical, and the proteins interact biochemically. We find that the 
interaction between Spire and Cappuccino family proteins is conserved across 
metazoan phyla and is mediated by binding of the formin homology 2 (FH2) domain 
from Cappuccino (or its mammalian homologue formin-2) to the kinase noncatalytic 
C-lobe domain (KIND) from Spire. In vitro, the KIND domain is a monomeric folded 
domain. Two KIND monomers bind each FH2 dimer with nanomolar affinity and 
strongly inhibit actin nucleation by the FH2 domain. In contrast, formation of 
the Spire-Cappuccino complex enhances actin nucleation by Spire. In Drosophila 
oocytes, Spire localizes to the cortex early in oogenesis and disappears around 
stage 10b, coincident with the onset of cytoplasmic streaming.
