BACKGROUND: The biologic agents causing leukoaraiosis are unknown. Our aim was 
to study the genetic basis of leukoaraiosis.
METHODS: We analyzed 212 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 142 patients 
with ischaemic stroke, generating a total of 30,104 genotypes. Seventy-nine 
subjects (55.6%) presented leukoaraiosis measured by the Fazekas scale and 69 
(48.6%) by ARWMC scale. We analyzed the presence of synergic associations 
between SNPs using the hfcc software. Finally, functional studies were performed 
in 56 subjects. The Ingenuity Pathways software (ipa) was used to examine the 
role of the identified genes.
RESULTS: Six SNPs were associated with leukoaraiosis using both measuring 
scales. After logistic regression adjusted for leukoaraiosis risk factors, the 
rs2252070 of MMP13 (OR = 4.9, 95%CI: 1.34-17.9, P = 0.016), rs662 of PON1 (OR = 
0.37, 95%CI: 0.15-0.87, P = 0.024) and rs1800779 of NOS3 (OR = 3.9, 95%CI: 
1.38-11.38, P = 0.01) were independently associated with leukoaraiosis under a 
dominant/recessive model and the rs2290608 of IL5RA (OR = 0.46, 95%CI: 
0.25-0.85, P = 0.013) and rs669 of A2M (OR = 2.5, 95%CI: 1.36-4.83, P = 0.004) 
under an additive model. Computational analysis showed a synergic association of 
rs10497212-AA of ITGB6 and rs2290608-GG of IL5RA with leukoaraiosis using both 
scales. (i) ARWMC (P = 1.3 × 10(-4) ) and (ii) Fazekas (P = 4.5 × 10(-5) ). 
Functional studies showed that the rs669 SNP was associated with plasma levels 
of A2M (P = 0.012) and A2M levels with leukoaraiosis in Fazekas scale (P = 
0.02). ipa analysis revealed that the genes associated with leukoaraiosis were 
involved in blood-brain barrier (BBB) homeostasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Amongst patients with ischaemic stroke, several genes associated 
with BBB homeostasis could be involved with a higher risk of leukoaraiosis.
