BACKGROUND: The lack of functional dystrophin protein in Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy (DMD) causes chronic skeletal muscle inflammation and degeneration. 
Therefore, the restoration of functional dystrophin levels is a fundamental 
approach for DMD therapy. Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is an emerging 
tool that provides noninvasive monitoring of muscle conditions and has been 
suggested as a treatment response biomarker in diverse indications. Although 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of skeletal muscles has become a standard 
measurement in clinical trials for DMD, EIM offers distinct advantages, such as 
portability, user-friendliness, and reduced cost, allowing for remote monitoring 
of disease progression or response to therapy. To investigate the potential of 
EIM as a biomarker for DMD, we compared longitudinal EIM data with 
MRI/histopathological data from an X-linked muscular dystrophy (mdx) mouse model 
of DMD. In addition, we investigated whether EIM could detect dystrophin-related 
changes in muscles using antisense-mediated exon skipping in mdx mice.
METHODS: The MRI data for muscle T2, the magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) 
data for fat fraction, and three EIM parameters with histopathology were 
longitudinally obtained from the hindlimb muscles of wild-type (WT) and mdx 
mice. In the EIM study, a cell-penetrating peptide (Pip9b2) conjugated antisense 
phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO), designed to induce exon-skipping 
and restore functional dystrophin production, was administered intravenously to 
mdx mice.
RESULTS: MRI imaging in mdx mice showed higher T2 intensity at 6 weeks of age in 
hindlimb muscles compared to WT mice, which decreased at ≥ 9 weeks of age. In 
contrast, EIM reactance began to decline at 12 weeks of age, with peak reduction 
at 18 weeks of age in mdx mice. This decline was associated with myofiber 
atrophy and connective tissue infiltration in the skeletal muscles. Repeated 
dosing of PPMO (10 mg/kg, 4 times every 2 weeks) in mdx mice led to an increase 
in muscular dystrophin protein and reversed the decrease in EIM reactance.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that muscle T2 MRI is sensitive to the early 
inflammatory response associated with dystrophin deficiency, whereas EIM 
provides a valuable biomarker for the noninvasive monitoring of subsequent 
changes in skeletal muscle composition. Furthermore, EIM reactance has the 
potential to monitor dystrophin-deficient muscle abnormalities and their 
recovery in response to antisense-mediated exon skipping.
