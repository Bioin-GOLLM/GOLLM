The production of hydrogen via microbial biotechnology is an active field of 
research. Given its ease of manipulation, the best-studied bacterium Escherichia 
coli has become a workhorse for enhanced hydrogen production through metabolic 
engineering, heterologous gene expression, adaptive evolution, and protein 
engineering. Herein, the utility of E. coli strains to produce hydrogen, via 
native hydrogenases or heterologous ones, is reviewed. In addition, potential 
strategies for increasing hydrogen production are outlined and whole-cell 
systems and cell-free systems are compared.
