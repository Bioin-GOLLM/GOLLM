Progeroid disorders overlapping with De Barsy syndrome (DBS) are collectively 
denoted as autosomal-recessive cutis laxa type 3 (ARCL3). They are caused by 
biallelic mutations in PYCR1 or ALDH18A1, encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate 
reductase 1 and pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), respectively, which 
both operate in the mitochondrial proline cycle. We report here on eight 
unrelated individuals born to non-consanguineous families clinically diagnosed 
with DBS or wrinkly skin syndrome. We found three heterozygous mutations in 
ALDH18A1 leading to amino acid substitutions of the same highly conserved 
residue, Arg138 in P5CS. A de novo origin was confirmed in all six probands for 
whom parental DNA was available. Using fibroblasts from affected individuals and 
heterologous overexpression, we found that the P5CS-p.Arg138Trp protein was 
stable and able to interact with wild-type P5CS but showed an altered 
sub-mitochondrial distribution. A reduced size upon native gel electrophoresis 
indicated an alteration of the structure or composition of P5CS mutant complex. 
Furthermore, we found that the mutant cells had a reduced P5CS enzymatic 
activity leading to a delayed proline accumulation. In summary, recurrent de 
novo mutations, affecting the highly conserved residue Arg138 of P5CS, cause an 
autosomal-dominant form of cutis laxa with progeroid features. Our data provide 
insights into the etiology of cutis laxa diseases and will have immediate impact 
on diagnostics and genetic counseling.
