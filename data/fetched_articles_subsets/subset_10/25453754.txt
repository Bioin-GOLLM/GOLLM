Defining the molecular networks that drive breast cancer has led to therapeutic 
interventions and improved patient survival. However, the aggressive 
triple-negative breast cancer subtype (TNBC) remains recalcitrant to targeted 
therapies because its molecular etiology is poorly defined. In this study, we 
used a forward genetic screen to discover an oncogenic network driving human 
TNBC. SCYL1, TEX14, and PLK1 ("STP axis") cooperatively trigger degradation of 
the REST tumor suppressor protein, a frequent event in human TNBC. The STP axis 
induces REST degradation by phosphorylating a conserved REST phospho-degron and 
bridging REST interaction with the ubiquitin-ligase βTRCP. Inhibition of the STP 
axis leads to increased REST protein levels and impairs TNBC transformation, 
tumor progression, and metastasis. Expression of the STP axis correlates with 
low REST protein levels in human TNBCs and poor clinical outcome for TNBC 
patients. Our findings demonstrate that the STP-REST axis is a molecular driver 
of human TNBC.
