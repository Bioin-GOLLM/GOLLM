We have previously shown that L58 in the putative 5th helical region of human 
interleukin-6 (IL-6) is important for activation of the IL-6 signal transducer 
gp130 [de Hon et al. (1995) FEBS Lett. 369, 187-191]. To further explore the 
importance of individual residues in this region for gp130 activation we have 
now combined Ala substitutions of residues E52, S53, S54, K55, E56, L58 and E60 
with other substitutions in IL-6, known to affect gp130 activation (Q160E and 
T163P). The combination mutant protein with L58A completely lost the capacity to 
induce the proliferation of XG-1 myeloma cells, and could effectively antagonize 
wild type IL-6 activity on these cells. Moreover, the data suggest that besides 
L58, S54 particularly, but also E52, S53, K55 and E56 contribute to gp130 
activation.
