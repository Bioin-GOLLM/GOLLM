BACKGROUND: There are forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that have an autosomal 
dominant inheritance pattern; one of them is caused by the E280A mutation in the 
gene that codes for Presenilin-1 (PSEN1). Studying families of people with this 
mutation allows the evaluation of characteristics of the subjects before 
cognitive decline begins.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether having the mutation E280A in PSEN1 increases the 
risk of presenting mental disorders in adults under 30 years old who are in the 
preclinical stage of AD and may be eligible for primary prevention studies of 
AD.
METHODS: A psychiatric evaluation was made to 120 people belonging to families 
with a history of early onset AD. Of these, 62 carried the E280A mutation in 
PSEN1. The occurrence of mental disorders between carriers and non-carriers of 
the mutation was compared.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of 
any mental disorder between the group of carriers and non-carriers of the 
mutation (Hazard Ratio: 0.80, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.31); nor were differences 
observed when evaluating specific disorders.
CONCLUSION: The E280A mutation does not increase the risk of mental disorders 
before the age of 30 in the relatives of people affected by familial AD. Studies 
with larger sample sizes are required to assess the risk of low incidence mental 
disorders.
