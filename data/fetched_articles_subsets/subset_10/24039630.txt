Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm that 
is largely resistant to traditional anti-cancer therapies. For years it has been 
considered a terminal condition and once diagnosed, patients generally survived 
less than a year despite aggressive treatment. Although rare, the worldwide 
incidence of MPM continues to rise, in part due to its association with asbestos 
exposure. Patients usually present with non-specific symptoms of abdominal 
distension and pain making the diagnosis challenging. In recent years, 
aggressive cytoreductive surgery with the administration of hyperthermic 
intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has improved survival in patients with MPM 
treated at multiple centers worldwide. This review article briefly highlights 
the presentation, diagnosis, and natural history of MPM. We then explore the 
available treatment options with primary focus on cytoreductive surgery and 
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
