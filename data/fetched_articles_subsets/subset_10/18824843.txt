Sweet syndrome is a multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by acute 
fever, as well as painful erythematous plaques infiltrated with mature 
neutrophils in the absence of vasculitis. The pathogenesis of the disease has 
not yet been clarified, although several proinflammatory cytokines have been 
reported to be involved in the disease process. We describe here a patient 
clinically diagnosed with Sweet syndrome with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The 
mutational analysis of the patient revealed a compound heterozygous E148Q/R202Q 
mutation in exon 2 of MEFV gene, which is a causative gene for familial 
Mediterranean fever. This is the first report to describe MEFV gene mutations in 
Sweet syndrome. Our results suggest that Sweet syndrome may be mediated though 
similar inflammatory mechanisms to those of familial Mediterranean fever.
