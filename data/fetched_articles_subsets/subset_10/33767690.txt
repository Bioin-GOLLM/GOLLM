Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant tumor 
found in the central nervous system. Currently, standard treatments in the 
clinic include maximal safe surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy and 
are mostly limited by low therapeutic efficiency correlated with poor prognosis. 
Immunotherapy, which predominantly focuses on peptide vaccines, dendritic cell 
vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and 
oncolytic virotherapy, have achieved some promising results in both preclinical 
and clinical trials. The future of immune therapy for GBM requires an integrated 
effort with rational combinations of vaccine therapy, cell therapy, and radio- 
and chemotherapy as well as molecule therapy targeting the tumor 
microenvironment.
