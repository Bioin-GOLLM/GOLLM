The epidemiological researches show that the mutations of GJB2, mitochondrial 
12S rRNA, and SLC26A4 genes have played an important role in the hearing loss. 
This study aims to investigate the mutation spectrum of GJB2, mitochondrial 12S 
rRNA, and SLC26A4 genes of Han Chinese, Hui people, and Uyghur ethnicities in 
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) patients in northwest of China. Mutational 
analyses in the three genes were brought by direct sequencing and each fragment 
was analyzed using an ABI 3730 DNA Sequencer. The mutation frequencies for the 
three HL causative genes were 34.05% in Han Chinese participants, 27.47% in Hui 
people, and 14.44% in Uyghur participants, respectively. The prevalence of GJB2 
mutations was 13.7%, 11.4%, and 11.4% in Han Chinese, Hui people, and Uyghur 
participants (χ(2) = 10.2, P < 0.05), respectively. The prevalence of mtDNA 12S 
rRNA A1555G homozygous mutations was 6.05%, 3.27%, and 1.44% in Han Chinese, Hui 
people, and Uyghur participants (χ(2) = 13.9, P < 0.05), respectively. The 
prevalence of SLC26A4 mutations was 14.3%, 12.8%, and 1.6% in Han Chinese, Hui 
people, and Uyghur participants, respectively. In summary, we find that Uyghur 
and Hui SNHL individuals vary significantly from Han Chinese patients in three 
causative HL genes' mutational spectrum, especially for Uyghur.
