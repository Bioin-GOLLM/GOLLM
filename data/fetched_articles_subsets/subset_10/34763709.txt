BACKGROUND: Recent single-cell transcriptomic studies report that IDH-mutant 
gliomas share a common hierarchy of cellular phenotypes, independent of genetic 
subtype. However, the genetic differences between IDH-mutant glioma subtypes are 
prognostic, predictive of response to chemotherapy, and correlate with distinct 
tumor microenvironments.
RESULTS: To reconcile these findings, we profile 22 human IDH-mutant gliomas 
using scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq. We determine the cell-type-specific differences 
in transcription factor expression and associated regulatory grammars between 
IDH-mutant glioma subtypes. We find that while IDH-mutant gliomas do share a 
common distribution of cell types, there are significant differences in the 
expression and targeting of transcription factors that regulate glial identity 
and cytokine elaboration. We knock out the chromatin remodeler ATRX, which 
suffers loss-of-function alterations in most IDH-mutant astrocytomas, in an 
IDH-mutant immunocompetent intracranial murine model. We find that both human 
ATRX-mutant gliomas and murine ATRX-knockout gliomas are more heavily 
infiltrated by immunosuppressive monocytic-lineage cells derived from 
circulation than ATRX-intact gliomas, in an IDH-mutant background. ATRX knockout 
in murine glioma recapitulates gene expression and open chromatin signatures 
that are specific to human ATRX-mutant astrocytomas, including drivers of 
astrocytic lineage and immune-cell chemotaxis. Through single-cell cleavage 
under targets and tagmentation assays and meta-analysis of public data, we show 
that ATRX loss leads to a global depletion in CCCTC-binding factor association 
with DNA, gene dysregulation along associated chromatin loops, and protection 
from therapy-induced senescence.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies explain how IDH-mutant gliomas from different 
subtypes maintain distinct phenotypes and tumor microenvironments despite a 
common lineage hierarchy.
