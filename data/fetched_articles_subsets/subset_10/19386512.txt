CD4+ T(H)17 cells display a featured role in barrier immunity. This effector 
population of T cells is important for clearance of microorganisms but can also 
promote autoimmunity at barrier sites. Recent work has indicated that these 
effector cells share a pathway with CD4+ regulatory T cells (T(R) cells) that 
also have a critical function in barrier protection and immune regulation. The 
development and function of T(H)17 cells, and their relationship with T(R) cells 
are discussed.
