A 41-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a painful and red 
left eye associated with chronic vision loss. He had a history of homelessness 
and polysubstance abuse including intravenous drug use. Fundus examination 
revealed several cream-colored lesions encroaching on the macula of the right 
eye, and a total retinal detachment with secondary neovascular glaucoma in the 
left eye. Further work-up with imaging and endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine 
needle aspiration revealed stage IV epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mu- 
tant (L858R) lung adenocarcinoma with brain, bone, adrenal, lymph node and 
bilateral choroid- al metastases. Herein we present a case of metastatic lung 
cancer masquerading as endophthalmitis.
