BACKGROUND: The progression of infectious diseases depends on the 
characteristics of a patient's innate immunity, and the efficiency of an immune 
system depends on the patient's genetic factors, including SNPs in the TLR 
genes. In this pilot study, we determined the frequency of alleles in these SNPs 
in a subset of patients with pneumonia.
METHODS: This study assessed six SNPs from TLR genes: rs5743551 (TLR1), 
rs5743708, rs3804100 (TLR2), rs4986790 (TLR4), rs5743810 (TLR6), and rs3764880 
(TLR8). Three groups of patients participated in this study: patients with 
pneumonia in 2019 (76 samples), patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 
2021 (85 samples), and the control group (99 samples).
RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequencies obtained for each group were 
examined using four genetic models. Significant results were obtained when 
comparing the samples obtained from individuals with pneumonia before the spread 
of SARS-CoV-2 and from the controls for rs5743551 (TLR1) and rs3764880 (TLR8). 
Additionally, the comparison of COVID-19-related pneumonia cases and the control 
group revealed a significant result for rs3804100-G (TLR2).
CONCLUSIONS: Determining SNP allele frequencies and searching for their 
associations with the course of pneumonia are important for personalized patient 
management. However, our results need to be comprehensively assessed in 
consideration of other clinical parameters.
