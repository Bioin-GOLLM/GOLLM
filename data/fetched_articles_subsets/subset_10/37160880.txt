Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors are 
engineered cell-surface receptors that sense a target antigen and respond by 
activating T cell receptor signaling or a customized gene program, respectively. 
Here, to expand the targeting capabilities of these receptors, we develop 
"universal" receptor systems for which receptor specificity can be directed 
post-translationally via covalent attachment of a co-administered antibody 
bearing a benzylguanine (BG) motif. A SNAPtag self-labeling enzyme is 
genetically fused to the receptor and reacts with BG-conjugated antibodies for 
covalent assembly, programming antigen recognition. We demonstrate that 
activation of SNAP-CAR and SNAP-synNotch receptors can be successfully targeted 
by clinically relevant BG-conjugated antibodies, including anti-tumor activity 
of SNAP-CAR T cells in vivo in a human tumor xenograft mouse model. Finally, we 
develop a mathematical model to better define the parameters affecting universal 
receptor signaling. SNAP receptors provide a powerful strategy to 
post-translationally reprogram the targeting specificity of engineered cells.
