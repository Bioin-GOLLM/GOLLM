Centrosomes, each containing a pair of centrioles, organize microtubules in 
animal cells, particularly during mitosis. DNA and centrosomes are normally 
duplicated once before cell division to maintain optimal genome integrity. We 
report a new role for the Orc1 protein, a subunit of the origin recognition 
complex (ORC) that is a key component of the DNA replication licensing 
machinery, in controlling centriole and centrosome copy number in human cells, 
independent of its role in DNA replication. Cyclin A promotes Orc1 localization 
to centrosomes where Orc1 prevents Cyclin E-dependent reduplication of both 
centrioles and centrosomes in a single cell division cycle. The data suggest 
that Orc1 is a regulator of centriole and centrosome reduplication as well as 
the initiation of DNA replication.
