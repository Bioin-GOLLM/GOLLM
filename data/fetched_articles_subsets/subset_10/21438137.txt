FUS, EWS, and TAF15 belong to the TET family of structurally similar 
DNA/RNA-binding proteins. Mutations in the FUS gene have recently been 
discovered as a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). Given 
the structural and functional similarities between the three genes, we screened 
TAF15 and EWS in 263 and 94 index FALS cases, respectively. No coding variants 
were found in EWS, while we identified six novel changes in TAF15. Of these, two 
24 bp deletions and a R388H missense variant were also found in healthy 
controls. A D386N substitution was shown not to segregate with the disease in 
the affected pedigree. A single A31T and two R395Q changes were identified in 
FALS cases but not in over 1,100 controls. Interestingly, one of the R395Q FALS 
cases also harbors a TARDBP mutation (G384R). Altogether, these results suggest 
that additional studies are needed to determine whether mutations in the TAF15 
gene represent a cause of FALS.
