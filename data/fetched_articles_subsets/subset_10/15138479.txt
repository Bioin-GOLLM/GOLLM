Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) frequently reveal genomic 
instability. We analysed different functional genetic variants affecting the 
folate and homocysteine metabolism important for DNA integrity in 31 PCNSL 
patients and 142 controls. We found significantly less carriers of the 
methionine synthase c.2756A>G (D919G) missense polymorphism among the patients 
(0.16 vs 0.42; odds ratio 0.26, CI(95%): 0.09-0.74; P=0.005), suggesting a 
protective function of the G allele. These data stimulate further 
epidemiological and functional studies focusing on the role of homocysteine and 
folate metabolism in lymphoma tumorigenesis.
