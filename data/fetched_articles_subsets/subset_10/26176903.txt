AIMS: Pharmacogenetic based dosing recommendations are provided in FDA-approved 
warfarin label for Caucasians. Evidence of notable difference in dosing 
algorithms of under-represented populations forced us to explore the genetic 
variability of CYP4F2 gene in Roma and Hungarian populations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 484 Roma, 493 Hungarian untreated subjects were genotyped 
for the CYP4F2*3 (rs2108622) variant by PCR-RFLP assay.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We firstly report, that frequencies of the CYP4F2 
rs2108622 GG, GA, AA genotypes and A allele in the Roma population were 46.5%, 
42.6%, 10.9% and 32.2%; in Hungarians 50.1%, 42.2%, 7.7% and 22.8%, 
respectively. Bearing of two minor alleles of CYP4F2 missense variant (AA 
genotype) modestly explains inter-ethnic differences of studied populations 
(p<0.08). CYP4F2*3 (V433M) risk allele frequency of Roma (0.32) was in higher 
range, and of Hungarians (0.23) in lower range, as compared with other world 
populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Roma have an elevated chance for higher mean warfarin dose, besides 
a decreased risk of major bleeding events in long-term warfarin use.
