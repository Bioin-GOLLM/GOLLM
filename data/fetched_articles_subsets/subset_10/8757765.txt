In several families, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) has been 
found in association with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis. It has been debated, 
however, whether the skin amyloidosis found in MEN 2A families, localized 
exclusively in the interscapular area, represents the same anomaly as that found 
in autosomal dominant familial cutaneous lichen amyloidosis, which is more 
generalized. We screened two MEN 2A families with associated skin amyloidosis 
for germline mutations in the RET gene responsible for the MEN 2A cancer 
syndrome, and found the same mutation characteristic of MEN 2A in both families. 
We also screened probands from three pedigrees with familial cutaneous lichen 
amyloidosis for RET mutations. In none of the RET coding and flanking intronic 
sequences was a mutation detected. This most probably indicates that skin 
amyloidosis found in some MEN 2A families and familial cutaneous lichen 
amyloidosis are different conditions. Consequently, patients with apparent 
familial cutaneous lichen amyloidosis do not appear to be at risk for MEN 2A.
