Epigenetic regulation is mediated by protein complexes that couple recognition 
of chromatin marks to activity or recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes. 
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a gene silencer that methylates lysine 27 
of histone H3, is stimulated upon recognition of its own catalytic product and 
has been shown to be more active on dinucleosomes than H3 tails or single 
nucleosomes. These properties probably facilitate local H3K27me2/3 spreading, 
causing heterochromatin formation and gene repression. Here, cryo-EM 
reconstructions of human PRC2 bound to bifunctional dinucleosomes show how a 
single PRC2, via interactions with nucleosomal DNA, positions the H3 tails of 
the activating and substrate nucleosome to interact with the EED subunit and the 
SET domain of EZH2, respectively. We show how the geometry of the PRC2-DNA 
interactions allows PRC2 to accommodate varying lengths of the linker DNA 
between nucleosomes. Our structures illustrate how an epigenetic regulator 
engages with a complex chromatin substrate.
