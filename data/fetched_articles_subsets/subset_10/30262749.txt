Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), is characterized by a heterogeneous group of 
cells, including cancer stem cells (CSCs), crucially involved in tumor 
initiation, progression and recurrence. CSCs appear to have a distinct metabolic 
phenotype, compared to non-stem cancer cells. How they adapt their metabolism to 
the cancer process is still unclear, and no data are yet available for PTC. We 
recently isolated thyrospheres, containing cancer stem-like cells, from B-CPAP 
and TPC-1 cell lines derived from PTC of the BRAF-like expression profile class, 
and stem-like cells from Nthy-ori3-1 normal thyreocyte-derived cell line. In the 
present study, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry metabolomic profiles of 
cancer thyrospheres were compared to cancer parental adherent cells and to non 
cancer thyrospheres profiles. A statistically significant decrease of glycolytic 
pathway metabolites and variations in Krebs cycle metabolites was found in 
thyrospheres versus parental cells. Moreover, cancer stem-like cells showed 
statistically significant differences in Krebs cycle intermediates, amino acids, 
cholesterol, and fatty acids content, compared to non-cancer stem-like cells. 
For the first time, data are reported on the metabolic profile of PTC cancer 
stem-like cells and confirm that changes in metabolic pathways can be explored 
as new biomarkers and targets for therapy in this tumor.
