Optical fiber sensors based on surface plasma technology have many unique 
advantages in specific applications such as extreme environmental monitoring, 
physical parameter determination, and biomedical indicators testing. In recent 
decades, various kinds of fiber probes with special structures were developed 
according to special processing such as tapering, splicing, etching, fiber 
balls, grating etc. In this paper, the fabrication technology, characteristics, 
development status and application scenarios of different special optical fiber 
structures are briefly reviewed, including common processing equipment. 
Furthermore, many special novel optical fiber structures reported in recent 
years are summarized, which have been used in various kinds of plasmonic sensing 
work. Then, the fiber-plasmonic sensors for practical applications are also 
introduced and examined in detail. The main aim of this review is to provide 
guidance and inspiration for researchers to design and fabricate special optical 
fiber structures, thus facilitating their further research.
