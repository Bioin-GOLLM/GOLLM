Classical and non-classical MHC I molecule manipulation by human 
cytomegalovirus: so many targetsâ€”but how many arrows in the quiver?

Halenius A, Gerke C, Hengel H.

Major mechanisms for the recognition of pathogens by immune cells have evolved 
to employ classical and non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I 
(MHC I) molecules. Classical MHC I molecules present antigenic peptide ligands 
on infected cells to CD8(+) T cells, whereas a key function for non-classical 
MHC I molecules is to mediate inhibitory or activating stimuli in natural killer 
(NK) cells. The structural diversity of MHC I puts immense pressure on 
persisting viruses, including cytomegaloviruses. The very large coding capacity 
of the human cytomegalovirus allows it to express a whole arsenal of 
immunoevasive factors assigned to individual MHC class I targets. This review 
summarizes achievements from more than two decades of intense research on how 
human cytomegalovirus manipulates MHC I molecules and escapes elimination by the 
immune system.
