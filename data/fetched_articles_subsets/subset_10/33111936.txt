Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), commonly occurring in the aged population, is a 
degenerative disease that dilate and weaken infrarenal aorta due to progressive 
degeneration of aortic wall integrity. Vinpocetine, a derivative of alkaloid 
vincamine, has long been used for cerebrovascular disorders and cognitive 
impairment in the aged population. Recent studies have indicated that 
vinpocetine antagonizes occlusive vascular disorders such as intimal hyperplasia 
and atherosclerosis. However, its role in vascular degenerative disease AAA 
remains unexplored. Herein, we determined the effect of vinpocetine on the 
formation of AAA as well as the intervention of pre-existing moderate AAA. AAA 
was induced by periaortic elastase application in C57BL/6J mice. Systemic 
vinpocetine treatment was applied daily via intraperitoneal injection. We showed 
that vinpocetine pre-treatment remarkably attenuated aneurysmal dilation 
assessed by diameter and volume. More importantly, vinpocetine also 
significantly suppressed the progression of pre-existing moderate AAA in a 
post-intervention model. Vinpocetine improved multiple cellular and molecular 
changes associated with AAA, such as elastin degradation, media smooth muscle 
cell depletion, collagen fibers remodeling and macrophage infiltration in 
aneurysmal tissues. Vinpocetine potently suppressed tumor necrosis 
factor-α-induced nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 
activation and proinflammatory mediator expression in primary cultured 
macrophages in vitro, as well as in the aorta wall in vivo, suggesting 
vinpocetine conferred anti-AAA effect at least partially via the inhibition of 
inflammation. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel role of vinpocetine in 
AAA formation, development and progression. Given the excellent safety profile 
of vinpocetine, the present study suggests vinpocetine may be a novel 
therapeutic agent for AAA prevention and treatment.
