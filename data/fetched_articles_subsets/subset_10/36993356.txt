Due to the enhanced labeling capability of maleimide-based fluorescent probes, 
lysine-cysteine-lysine (KCK) tags are frequently added to proteins for 
visualization. In this study, we employed in vitro single-molecule DNA 
flow-stretching assay as a sensitive way to assess the impact of the KCK-tag on 
the property of DNA-binding proteins. Using Bacillus subtilis ParB as an 
example, we show that, although no noticeable changes were detected by in vivo 
fluorescence imaging and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, the 
KCK-tag substantially altered ParB's DNA compaction rates, its response to 
nucleotide binding and to the presence of the specific sequence (parS) on the 
DNA. While it is typically assumed that short peptide tags minimally perturb 
protein function, our results urge researchers to carefully validate the use of 
tags for protein labeling. Our comprehensive analysis can be expanded and used 
as a guide to assess the impacts of other tags on DNA-binding proteins in 
single-molecule assays.
