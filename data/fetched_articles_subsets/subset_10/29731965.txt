Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma subtype 
characterized by both biological and clinical heterogeneity. In refractory 
cases, complete response/complete response unconfirmed rates in salvage therapy 
remain low. We performed whole-exome sequencing of DLBCL in a discovery cohort 
comprising 26 good and nine poor prognosis cases. After candidate genes were 
identified, prognoses were examined in 85 individuals in the DLBCL validation 
cohort. In the discovery cohort, five patients in the poor prognosis group 
harbored both a TP53 mutation and 17p deletion. Sixteen mutations were 
identified in OSBPL10 in nine patients in the good prognosis group, but none in 
the poor prognosis group. In the validation cohort, TP53 mutations and TP53 
deletions were confirmed to be poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) 
(P = 0.016) and progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.023) only when both 
aberrations co-existed. OSBPL10 mutations were validated as prognostic markers 
for excellent OS (P = 0.037) and PFS (P = 0.041). Significant differences in OS 
and PFS were observed when patients were stratified into three groups-OSBPL10 
mutation (best prognosis), the coexistence of both TP53 mutation and TP53 
deletion (poorest prognosis), and others. In this study, the presence of both 
TP53 mutation and 17p/TP53 deletion, but not the individual variants, was 
associated with poor prognosis in DLBCL patients after treatment with rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP) or similar 
regimens. We also identified OSBPL10 mutation as a marker for patients with 
excellent prognosis in the R-CHOP era.
