In the last two decades, extracellular vesicle-mediated communication between 
cells has become a major field in cell biology. However, the function of 
extracellular vesicles is far from clear, especially due to the disparity of 
released vesicles by cells. Basically, one must consider vesicles budding from 
the cell plasma membrane (ectosomes) and vesicles released upon fusion of an 
endosomal multivesicular compartment (exosomes). Moreover, even for exosomes, we 
report and discuss here the possibility that different routes regulated by 
specific Rab GTPases might produce exosomes having various biologic functions.
