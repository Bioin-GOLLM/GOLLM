OBJECTIVE: While twin and adoption studies have demonstrated that up to 70% of 
the risk for becoming addicted to cocaine is due to genetic factors, identifying 
specific genes involved in the development or progression of cocaine dependence 
has been difficult. The purpose of this study is to determine whether 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the Homer1 and Homer2 genes associate with 
the cocaine-dependent phenotype in an African American population.
METHODS: This study utilized a case-control design in which the genotype and 
allele frequencies for four single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the Homer1 gene 
and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the Homer2 gene were compared 
between African American individuals with a diagnosis of cocaine dependence 
(n=170) and African American individuals with no history of substance abuse 
(n=90).
RESULTS: The data indicate that one single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs6871510, 
located in intron 1 of the Homer1 gene significantly (P=0.029) associates with 
cocaine dependence at the genotype level, and trends toward a significant 
association at the allele frequency level (chi=2.62, df=1, P=0.106, OR=1.71). 
None of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms analyzed in the Homer2 gene 
associates with cocaine dependence.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that a polymorphism in the Homer1 
gene, rs6871510, is a potential risk factor for the development of cocaine 
dependence in an African American population, whereas polymorphisms in the 
Homer2 gene are not.
