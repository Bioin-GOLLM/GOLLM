Eighteen years ago, unexpected epileptic seizures in Selenop-knockout mice 
pointed to a potentially novel, possibly underestimated, and previously 
difficult to study role of selenium (Se) in the mammalian brain. This mouse 
model was the key to open the field of molecular mechanisms, i.e., to delineate 
the roles of selenium and individual selenoproteins in the brain, and answer 
specific questions like: how does Se enter the brain; which processes and which 
cell types are dependent on selenoproteins; and, what are the individual roles 
of selenoproteins in the brain? Many of these questions have been answered and 
much progress is being made to fill remaining gaps. Mouse and human genetics 
have together boosted the field tremendously, in addition to traditional 
biochemistry and cell biology. As always, new questions have become apparent or 
more pressing with solving older questions. We will briefly summarize what we 
know about selenoproteins in the human brain, glance over to the mouse as a 
useful model, and then discuss new questions and directions the field might take 
in the next 18 years.
