The ancient Hungarians originated from the Ural region in today's central Russia 
and migrated across the Eastern European steppe, according to historical 
sources. The Hungarians conquered the Carpathian Basin 895-907 AD, and admixed 
with the indigenous communities. Here we present mitochondrial DNA results from 
three datasets: one from the Avar period (7(th)-9(th) centuries) of the 
Carpathian Basin (n = 31); one from the Hungarian conquest-period (n = 76); and 
a completion of the published 10(th)-12(th) century Hungarian-Slavic contact 
zone dataset by four samples. We compare these mitochondrial DNA hypervariable 
segment sequences and haplogroup results with published ancient and modern 
Eurasian data. Whereas the analyzed Avars represents a certain group of the Avar 
society that shows East and South European genetic characteristics, the 
Hungarian conquerors' maternal gene pool is a mixture of West Eurasian and 
Central and North Eurasian elements. Comprehensively analyzing the results, both 
the linguistically recorded Finno-Ugric roots and historically documented Turkic 
and Central Asian influxes had possible genetic imprints in the conquerors' 
genetic composition. Our data allows a complex series of historic and population 
genetic events before the formation of the medieval population of the Carpathian 
Basin, and the maternal genetic continuity between 10(th)-12(th) century and 
modern Hungarians.
