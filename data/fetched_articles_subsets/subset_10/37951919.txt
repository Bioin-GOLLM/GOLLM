BACKGROUND: With the continuous discovery of new borderline thyroid lesions and 
benign and malignant "gray areas", coupled with the limitations of traditional 
immune indicators, the differential diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(PTC) has become more difficult. Cyclin D1 and P21 are cell cycle regulators 
involved in the occurrence and metastasis of multiple tumors, including PTC, but 
their specific functions are unclear.
METHODS: In our study, immunohistochemical staining was used to explore the 
expression of Cyclin D1 and P21 in PTC, paracancerous tissue, follicular adenoma 
(FA) and papillary thyroid hyperplasia. In addition, their relationship with the 
clinicopathological features of PTC and their differential diagnostic value in 
distinguishing between intralymph node PTC metastases and intralymph node 
ectopic thyroid tissue were studied.
RESULTS: Among 200 primary PTC lesions, Cyclin D1 and P21 were found to be 
expressed in 186 (93.00%) and 177 (88.50%), respectively, and their expression 
levels were significantly higher in PTC tissue than in adjacent tissue, FA 
tissue and papillary thyroid hyperplasia tissue (P < 0.05). The expression 
levels of Cyclin D1 and P21 were positively correlated with tumor size and lymph 
node metastasis (P < 0.05) but not with sex, age, number of tumor lesions, 
histological subtype, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or TNM stage (P < 0.05). 
The expression levels of Cyclin D1 and P21 were significantly correlated 
(P < 0.05). The positivity rates of Cyclin D1 and P21 in intralymph node PTC 
metastases were 97.96% (48/49) and 89.80% (44/49), respectively, which were 
significantly higher than those in intralymph node ectopic thyroid tissue 
(P < 0.05). The sensitivity (Se) and negative predictive value (NPV) of Cyclin 
D1 and P21 detection alone or in combination were higher than those of the 
combined detection of the classical antibody markers CK19, HBME-1 and 
Galectin-3. Besides, the Se, Sp, PPV and NPV of Cyclin D1 and P21 in 
differentiating intralymph node PTC metastases and intralymph node ectopic 
thyroid tissue were higher.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that Cyclin D1 and P21 are highly 
sensitive and specific markers for the diagnosis of PTC that are superior to 
traditional classical antibodies. And, these two markers are of great value in 
the differential diagnosis of intralymph node PTC metastases and intralymph node 
ectopic thyroid tissue.
