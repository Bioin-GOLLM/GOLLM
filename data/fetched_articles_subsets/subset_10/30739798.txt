The RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in plants controls gene 
expression via cytosine DNA methylation. The ability to manipulate RdDM would 
shed light on the mechanisms and applications of DNA methylation to control gene 
expression. Here, we identified diverse RdDM proteins that are capable of 
targeting methylation and silencing in Arabidopsis when tethered to an 
artificial zinc finger (ZF-RdDM). We studied their order of action within the 
RdDM pathway by testing their ability to target methylation in different 
mutants. We also evaluated ectopic siRNA biogenesis, RNA polymerase V (Pol V) 
recruitment, targeted DNA methylation, and gene-expression changes at thousands 
of ZF-RdDM targets. We found that co-targeting both arms of the RdDM pathway, 
siRNA biogenesis and Pol V recruitment, dramatically enhanced targeted 
methylation. This work defines how RdDM components establish DNA methylation and 
enables new strategies for epigenetic gene regulation via targeted DNA 
methylation.
