BACKGROUND: Deletions of the HOXC gene cluster result in variable phenotypes in 
mice, but have been rarely described in humans.
OBJECTIVE: To report chromosome 12q13.13 microdeletions ranging from 13 to 175 
kb and involving the 5' HOXC genes in four families, segregating congenital 
lower limb malformations, including clubfoot, vertical talus and hip dysplasia.
METHODS: Probands (N=253) with clubfoot or vertical talus were screened for 
point mutations and copy number variants using multiplexed direct genomic 
selection, a pooled BAC targeted capture approach. SNP genotyping included 1178 
probands with clubfoot or vertical talus and 1775 controls.
RESULTS: The microdeletions share a minimal non-coding region overlap upstream 
of HOXC13, with variable phenotypes depending upon HOXC13, HOXC12 or the HOTAIR 
lncRNA inclusion. SNP analysis revealed HOXC11 p.Ser191Phe segregating with 
clubfoot in a small family and enrichment of HOXC12 p.Asn176Lys in patients with 
clubfoot or vertical talus (rs189468720, p=0.0057, OR=3.8). Defects in limb 
morphogenesis include shortened and overlapping toes, as well as peroneus muscle 
hypoplasia. Finally, HOXC and HOXD gene expression is reduced in fibroblasts 
from a patient with a 5' HOXC deletion, consistent with previous studies 
demonstrating that dosage of lncRNAs alters expression of HOXD genes in trans.
CONCLUSIONS: Because HOXD10 has been implicated in the aetiology of congenital 
vertical talus, variation in its expression may contribute to the lower limb 
phenotypes occurring with 5' HOXC microdeletions. Identification of 5' HOXC 
microdeletions highlights the importance of transcriptional regulators in the 
aetiology of severe lower limb malformations and will improve their diagnosis 
and management.
