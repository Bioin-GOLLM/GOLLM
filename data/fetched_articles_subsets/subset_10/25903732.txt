In this study, we determined the association between rs6897932 in interleukin 7 
receptor α (IL7Ra) gene and the risk and disability progression of multiple 
sclerosis (MS) in 270 MS patients and 303 controls. We found allele C to be 
associated with the risk of MS and minor allele T to be protective against MS 
development. Moreover, we revealed for the first time that rs6897932 in IL7Ra 
gene is associated with the progression of MS, evaluated by MSSS scores. The 
minor allele T and genotype TT are protective against a rapid disability 
progression in MS in the Central European Slovak population.
