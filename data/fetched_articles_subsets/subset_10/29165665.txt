Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) encodes two CRP/FNR family transcription 
factors (TF) that contribute to virulence, Cmr (Rv1675c) and CRPMt (Rv3676). 
Prior studies identified distinct chromosomal binding profiles for each TF 
despite their recognizing overlapping DNA motifs. The present study shows that 
Cmr binding specificity is determined by discriminator nucleotides at motif 
positions 4 and 13. X-ray crystallography and targeted mutational analyses 
identified an arginine-rich loop that expands Cmr's DNA interactions beyond the 
classical helix-turn-helix contacts common to all CRP/FNR family members and 
facilitates binding to imperfect DNA sequences. Cmr binding to DNA results in a 
pronounced asymmetric bending of the DNA and its high level of cooperativity is 
consistent with DNA-facilitated dimerization. A unique N-terminal extension 
inserts between the DNA binding and dimerization domains, partially occluding 
the site where the canonical cAMP binding pocket is found. However, an 
unstructured region of this N-terminus may help modulate Cmr activity in 
response to cellular signals. Cmr's multiple levels of DNA interaction likely 
enhance its ability to integrate diverse gene regulatory signals, while its 
novel structural features establish Cmr as an atypical CRP/FNR family member.
