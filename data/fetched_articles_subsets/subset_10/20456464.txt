AIM: Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a modifier of adenomatous polyposis 
coli-dependent tumourigenesis. The G316 > A polymorphism in intron 1 of the ODC 
gene lies between two myc-binding domains and alters the expression of the gene 
to affect polyamine metabolism. This variant may be associated with recurrence 
of colorectal adenoma. We examined whether this variant also modified the 
susceptibility to sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHOD: The G316 > A variant was analysed in a large (n = 754) CRC 
case-controlled series of hospital patient volunteers (n = 627) in the Czech 
Republic, and the relationship with cancer risk was estimated by conditional 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: After adjusting for age and sex, G316 > A was associated with no 
decrease in CRC risk for either heterozygotes [odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.77-1.23] or rare allele homozygotes (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 
0.61-1.37).
CONCLUSION: The G316 > A functional variant in the ODC gene is unlikely to make 
much impact on reducing CRC risk regardless of the reduction in risk found for 
the recurrence of colorectal adenoma.
