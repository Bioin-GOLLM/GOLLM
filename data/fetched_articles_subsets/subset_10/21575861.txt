Wnt canonical signaling is critical for normal development as well as 
homeostasis of several epithelial tissues, and constitutive activation of this 
pathway is commonly observed in carcinomas. We show here that 50% of human 
sarcomas (n = 45) and 65% of sarcoma cell lines (n = 23) of diverse histological 
subtypes exhibit upregulated autocrine canonical Wnt signaling. Furthermore, in 
Wnt autocrine cell lines, we identify alterations including overexpression or 
gene amplification of Wnt ligands and/or LRP5/6 coreceptors and epigenetic 
silencing of different cell surface Wnt antagonists. Mutations in adenomatous 
polyposis coli (APC) gene were observed in two nonautocrine Wnt-positive sarcoma 
cell lines. Finally, downregulation of the activated Wnt pathway inhibited 
sarcoma cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo by a mechanism involving 
the downregulation of CDC25A.
