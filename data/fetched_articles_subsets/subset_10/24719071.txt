Vemurafenib-associated keratoses with genetic heterogeneity of RAS.

Loh E, Hosler GA.

Vemurafenib is a recently approved targeted therapy for advanced melanoma 
harboring the B-Raf valine-to-glutamate mutation at residue 600 (V600E). In many 
patients, the use of vemurafenib leads to a rapid onset of cutaneous neoplasms, 
including squamous cell carcinomas, keratoacanthomas, and benign keratoses. 
Paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by 
vemurafenib in the setting of RAS hyperactivation has been demonstrated in the 
laboratory and may account for the pathogenesis of some of these neoplasms. 
Activating RAS mutations have been discovered in vemurafenib-associated squamous 
cell carcinomas, but have not been reported in benign keratoses, which are a 
more common side effect that affects patient quality of life. Here, we report on 
the mutational analysis of RAS genes at known activating hotspots in verrucous 
keratoses from a stage IV melanoma patient undergoing vemurafenib therapy. The 
results lend genetic evidence to the current hypothesis for how some of these 
lesions develop and suggest potential strategies in the research on preventive 
and therapeutic measures.
