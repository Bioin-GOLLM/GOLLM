Sickle cell disease (SCD) nephropathy and lower estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) are risk factors for early mortality. Furthermore, rate of eGFR 
decline predicts progression to end-stage renal disease in many clinical 
settings. However, factors predicting renal function decline in SCD are poorly 
documented. Using clinical, laboratory, genetic, and metabolomic data, we 
evaluated predictors of renal function decline in a longitudinal cohort of 288 
adults (mean age 33.0 years). In 193 subjects with 5-year follow-up data, mean 
rate of eGFR decline was 2.35 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year, nearly twice that of African 
American adults overall. Hyperfiltration was prevalent at baseline (61.1%), and 
36.8% of subjects experienced rapid eGFR decline (≥3 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year). 
Severe Hb genotype; proteinuria; higher platelet and reticulocyte counts, and 
systolic BP; and lower Hb level and BMI were associated with rapid decline. A 
risk scoring system was created using these 7 variables and was highly 
predictive of rapid eGFR decline, with odds of rapid decline increasing 
1.635-fold for every point increment (P < 0.0001). Rapid eGFR decline was also 
associated with higher organ system severity score and peak creatinine. 
Additionally, two metabolites (asymmetric dimethylarginine and quinolinic acid) 
were associated with rapid decline. Further investigation into longitudinal SCD 
nephropathy (SCDN) trajectory, early markers of SCDN, and tools for risk 
stratification should inform interventional studies targeted to slowing GFR 
decline and improving SCD outcomes.
