Increasing amounts of evidence has demonstrated that T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus) patients have increased susceptibility to CRC (colorectal cancer). As 
HHEX is a recognized susceptibility gene in T2DM, this work was focused on two 
SNPs in HHEX, rs1111875 and rs7923837, to study their association with CRC. T2DM 
patients without CRC (T2DM-only, n=300), T2DM with CRC (T2DM/CRC, n=135), 
cancer-free controls (Control, n=570), and CRC without T2DM (CRC-only, n=642) 
cases were enrolled. DNA samples were extracted from the peripheral blood 
leukocytes of the patients and sequenced by direct sequencing. The Ï‡2 test was 
used to compare categorical data. We found that in T2DM patients, rs1111875 but 
not the rs7923837 in HHEX gene was associated with the occurrence of CRC (p= 
0.006). for rs1111875, TC/CC patients had an increased risk of CRC (p=0.019, 
OR=1.592, 95%CI=1.046-2.423). Moreover, our results also indicated that the two 
variants of HEEX gene could be risk factors for CRC in general population, 
independent on T2DM (p< 0.001 for rs1111875, p=0.001 for rs7923837). For 
rs1111875, increased risk of CRC was observed in TC or TC/CC than CC individuals 
(p<0.001, OR= 1.780, 95%CI= 1.385-2.287; p<0.001, OR= 1.695, 95%CI= 
1.335-2.152). For rs7923837, increased CRC risk was observed in AG, GG, and 
AG/GG than AA individuals (p< 0.001, OR= 1.520, 95%CI= 1.200-1.924; p=0.036, OR= 
1.739, 95%CI= 0.989-3.058; p< 0.001, OR= 1.540, 95%CI= 1.225-1.936). This 
finding highlights the potentially functional alteration with HHEX rs1111875 and 
rs7923837 polymorphisms may increase CRC susceptibility. Risk effects and the 
functional impact of these polymorphisms need further validation.
