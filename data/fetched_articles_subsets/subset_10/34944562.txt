Pustular psoriasis (PP) is a clinicopathological entity encompassing different 
variants, i.e., acute generalized PP (GPP), PP of pregnancy (impetigo 
herpetiformis), annular (and circinate) PP, infantile/juvenile PP, palmoplantar 
PP/palmoplantar pustulosis, and acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH), 
which have in common an eruption of superficial sterile pustules on an 
erythematous base. Unlike psoriasis vulgaris, in which a key role is played by 
the adaptive immune system and interleukin (IL)-17/IL-23 axis, PP seems to be 
characterized by an intense inflammatory response resulting from innate immunity 
hyperactivation, with prominent involvement of the IL-36 axis. Some nosological 
aspects of PP are still controversial and debated. Moreover, owing to the rarity 
and heterogeneity of PP forms, data on prognosis and therapeutic management are 
limited. Recent progresses in the identification of genetic mutations and 
immunological mechanisms have promoted a better understanding of PP pathogenesis 
and might have important consequences on diagnostic refinement and treatment. In 
this narrative review, current findings in the pathogenesis, classification, 
clinical features, and therapeutic management of PP are briefly discussed.
