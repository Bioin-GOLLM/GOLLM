Arylsulfatase B (N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase; ARSB) removes 4-sulfate 
groups from chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S) and dermatan sulfate and is required for 
their degradation. In human prostate stromal and epithelial cells, when ARSB was 
silenced, C4S, versican and versican promoter activity increased, and the 
galectin-3 that co-immunoprecipitated with C4S declined. Galectin-3 silencing 
inhibited the ARSB-silencing-induced increases in versican and versican promoter 
due to effects on the AP-1-binding site in the versican promoter. These findings 
demonstrate for the first time the transcriptional mechanism whereby ARSB can 
regulate expression of an extracellular matrix proteoglycan with C4S 
attachments. In addition, following ARSB silencing, C4S that 
co-immunoprecipitated with versican increased, whereas co-immunoprecipitated 
EGFR declined, total EGFR increased and exogenous EGF-induced cell proliferation 
increased, suggesting profound effects of ARSB on vital cell processes.
