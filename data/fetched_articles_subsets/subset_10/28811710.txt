AIM: To investigate the effect of a single amino acid mutation in human class B 
scavenger receptor I (SR-BI) on the infectivity of cell culture-derived 
hepatitis C virus (HCVcc) in SR-BI knock-down Huh7-siSR-BI cells.
METHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct the SR-BI S112F 
mutation, and the mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. SR-BI 
knock-down Huh7-siSR-BI cells were transfected with SR-BI S112F, SR-BI wild type 
(WT) and control plasmids, and then infected with HCVpp (HCV pseudoparticles) 
and hepatitis C virus derived from cell culture (HCVcc). A fluorescence assay 
was performed to analyze the effect of the S112F mutation on HCV entry; 
quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot assays were 
used to analyze the effect of the S112F mutation on HCV infectivity. CHO cells 
expressing WT and SR-BI S112F were incubated with the HCV E2 protein expressed 
in HEK 293T cells, and flow cytometry was performed to examine the ability of 
SR-BI S112F to bind to the HCV E2 protein. Huh7-siSR-BI cells were transfected 
with SR-BI WT and the S112F mutant, and then DiI-HDL was added and images 
captured under the microscope to assess the ability of SR-BI S112F to take up 
HDL.
RESULTS: The SR-BI S112F mutation was successfully constructed. The S112F 
mutation decreased the expression of the SR-BI mRNA and protein. SR-BI S112F 
decreased HCV entry and HCVcc infectivity in Huh7-siSR-BI cells. The S112F 
mutation impaired the binding of SR-BI to HCV E2 protein and decreased the HDL 
uptake of SR-BI.
CONCLUSION: The S112F single amino acid mutation in SR-BI decreased the levels 
of the SR-BI mRNA and protein, as well as the ability of SR-BI to bind to the 
HCV E2 protein. Amino acid 112 in SR-BI plays important roles in HCV entry and 
the infectivity of HCVcc in vitro.
