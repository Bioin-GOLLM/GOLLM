OBJECTIVE: The formation of three-dimensional spheroid tumor model using the 
scaffold-based platforms has been demonstrated over many years now. 3D tumor 
models are generated mainly in non-scalable culture systems, using synthetic and 
biological scaffolds. Many of these models fail to reflect the complex tumor 
microenvironment and do not allow long-term monitoring of tumor progression. 
This has resulted in inconsistent data in drug testing assays during preclinical 
and clinical studies.
METHODS: To overcome these limitations, we have developed 3D tissueoids model by 
using novel AXTEX-4D platform.
RESULTS: Cancer 3D tissueoids demonstrated the basic features of 3D cell culture 
with rapid attachment, proliferation, and longevity with contiguous cytoskeleton 
and hypoxic core. This study also demonstrated greater drug resistance in 
3D-MCF-7 tissueoids in comparison to 2D monolayer cell culture.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, 3D-tissueoids are more responsive than 2D-cultured 
cells in simulating important tumor characteristics, anti-apoptotic features, 
and their resulting drug resistance.
