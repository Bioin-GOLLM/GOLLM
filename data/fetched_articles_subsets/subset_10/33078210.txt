The dynamic coordination of processes controlling the quality of the 
mitochondrial network is crucial to maintain the function of mitochondria in 
skeletal muscle. Changes of mitochondrial proteolytic system, dynamics 
(fusion/fission), and mitophagy induce pathways that affect muscle mass and 
performance. When muscle mass is lost, the risk of disease onset and premature 
death is dramatically increased. For instance, poor quality of muscles 
correlates with the onset progression of several age-related disorders such as 
diabetes, obesity, cancer, and aging sarcopenia. To date, there are no drug 
therapies to reverse muscle loss, and exercise remains the best approach to 
improve mitochondrial health and to slow atrophy in several diseases. This 
review will describe the principal mechanisms that control mitochondrial quality 
and the pathways that link mitochondrial dysfunction to muscle mass regulation.
