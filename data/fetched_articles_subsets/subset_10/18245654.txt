Due to a homozygous Gly204Arg mutation in the factor X (FX) gene no detectable 
FX antigen was found in the plasma of a one-year old patient with severe 
bleeding diathesis. The amino acid replacement destabilized the disulfide bond 
that holds the two FX chains together, decreasing the interaction between the 
Cys201-Cys206 loop region and the region connecting the EGF2 and serine protease 
domains. Both Gly204 FX and Arg204 FX were synthesized in transfected cells, but 
only the wild type protein became secreted. The mutant protein was diverted from 
the normal secretory pathway and retained at the trans Golgi-late endosome 
level.
