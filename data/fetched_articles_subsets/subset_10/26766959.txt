Genes related to serotonin are associated with responses to treatment for 
depression. We examined associations between the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) 
and serotonin 2a receptor (5-HTR2a) genes and responses to treatment for 
depressive disorders in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A total of 255 patients 
who met the DSM-IV major or minor depressive disorder and recently developed ACS 
were randomly assigned to the escitalopram (n=127) or placebo (n=128) group in 
this 24-week double-blind trial (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT00419471). 
Remission was defined as a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) score â‰¤7. 
Assays were performed for the 5-HTTLPR, STin2 VNTR, 5-HTR2a 102T/C, and 5-HTR2a 
1438A/G genotypes. Escitalopram was superior to placebo for treating depressive 
disorder with ACS but there were no significant associations between 
serotonergic genes and treatment responses even when considering ACS severity. 
The effect of escitalopram was independent of 5-HTT and 5-HTR2a polymorphisms.
