INTRODUCTION: Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically 
improved outcomes for nononcogene-addicted NSCLC, monotherapy with programmed 
cell death protein-1 (PD1) inhibition has been associated with low efficacy in 
the EGFR-mutant setting. Given the potential for synergism with combination 
checkpoint blockade, we designed a trial to test the activity of combination 
nivolumab (N)-ipilimumab (NI) in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
METHODS: This is a randomized phase 2 study (NCT03091491) of N versus NI 
combination in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant NSCLC, with 
crossover permitted on disease progression. The primary end point was the 
objective response rate, and the secondary end points included progression-free 
survival, overall survival, and safety of ICI after EGFR TKI.
RESULTS: Recruitment ceased owing to futility after 31 of 184 planned patients 
were treated. A total of 15 patients received N and 16 received NI combination. 
There were 16 patients (51.6%) who had programmed death-ligand (PDL1) 1 greater 
than or equal to 1%, and 15 (45.2%) harbored EGFR T790M. Five patients derived 
clinical benefits from ICI with one objective response (objective response rate 
3.2%), and median progression-free survival was 1.22 months (95% confidence 
interval: 1.15-1.35) for the overall cohort. None of the four patients who 
crossed over achieved salvage response by NI. PDL1 and tumor mutational burden 
(TMB) were not able to predict ICI response. Rates of all grade immune-related 
adverse events were similar (80% versus 75%), with only two grade 3 events.
CONCLUSIONS: Immune checkpoint inhibition is ineffective in EGFR TKI-resistant 
NSCLC. Whereas a small subgroup of EGFR-mutant NSCLC may be immunogenic and 
responsive to ICI, better biomarkers are needed to select appropriate patients.
