OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to detect a possible association between 
PTPN22 gene polymorphisms and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese Han population.
METHODS: 7 PTPN22 SNPs were genotyped in 358 patients with RA and 713 patients 
with SLE, as well as 564 RA controls and 672 SLE controls by Restriction 
Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). Association analyses were conducted on the 
whole data set. Significant relationships were also examined between clinical 
features and SNPs for both RA and SLE.
RESULTS: Rs2476601 was lack of polymorphism with a ⩽0.1% frequency in both SLE 
and RA patients and healthy controls in our study. The two SNPs rs1217414 and 
rs3811021 of PTPN22 shown strong association with both SLE (rs1217414T: 
padj = 6.07e-004, OR=0.57; rs3811021C: padj = 4.68e-005, OR=0.65) and RA 
(rs1217414T: padj = 2.01e-008, OR=0.26; rs3811021C: padj = 0.028, OR=0.70). And 
the rs3765598 revealed a strong risk factor for SLE (p=9.38e-009, 
padj = 6.57e-008, OR=1.93), but not for RA (p=0.48, OR=1.12). Moreover, 
protective haplotype ACTTC in RA (p=7.73e-016, padj = 5.51-015, 
OR[95%CI]=0.02[0.002-0.10]) and SLE (p=8.29e-018, padj = 5.80e-017, 
OR[95%CI]=0.11[0.06-0.21]) were observed. In addition, the distribution of risk 
haplotypes ACGTC and GCTTT in RA (ACGTC: p=0.0006, padj = 0.004, 
OR[95%CI]=1.85[1.29-2.63]; GCTTT: p=2.62e-005, padj = 1.85e-004, 
OR[95%CI]=2.40[1.57-3.65]) and SLE (ACGTC: p=0.0006, padj = 0.004, 
OR[95%CI]=1.85[1.29-2.63]; ACGTC: p=7.74e-011, padj = 6.81e-010, 
OR[95%CI]=2.21[1.12-3.34]; GCTTT: p=2.40[1.57-3.65], padj = 2.26e-006, 
OR[95%CI]=2.64[1.79-3.87]) were significant different from that in controls. 
Furthermore, significant association was observed between the PTPN22 rs3765598 
and antinuclear antibodies 1 (ANA1) in SLE.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide strong evidence that the rs1217414 and rs3811021 
in PTPN22 gene might be common protective factors contributed to SLE and RA 
susceptibility in the Chinese Han population. While, the rs3765598 might 
increase the genetic susceptibility of SLE, but not RA.
