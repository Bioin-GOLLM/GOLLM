In this study, the branch, leaves, flowers, roots and mixed parts of different 
nine Euphorbia species were analyzed for their trace element contents by using 
ICP-MS. The samples were digested by concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen 
peroxide in a microwave by ICP-MS before the analysis. The accuracy and 
precision of the method was evaluated by CRM 1573a Tomato Leaves. Trace element 
contents accumulated in different parts of each sample were contrasted. Minitab 
Statistical Software Inc., programme was used for the multivariate analysis of 
12 toxic metals of seeds, roots, branches, leaves, flowers, and mixed parts of 
Euphorbia species collected from Diyarbakir, Kayseri, Malatya, Mardin, Trabzon, 
and Van cities.When the studied Euphorbia species are compared in terms of their 
metal contents; V, Tl, Cr, and Ni metals in E. eriophora, Ba in E. aleppica, As 
and Co metals in E. segıieriana, Ag and Se metals in E. craspedia, Cu and Cd 
metals in E. fistulosa, Cs and Pb metals in E. grisophylla, Zn in E. macroclada 
and also Rb and Sr metals in E. denticulata were determined higher. It was 
determined that the studied species accumulated some metals at highly amounts 
especially in the root and leaf parts. In general, it can be said that Euphorbia 
species have high potential to become a biomonitor. For this reason, it can be 
predicted that these species will be used as ornamental plants in landscape 
architecture due to both their toxic metals retention properties and their 
beautiful appearance.
