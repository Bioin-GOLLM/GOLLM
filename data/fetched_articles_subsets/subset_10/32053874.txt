Background: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is very rare in the pediatric and 
adolescent age range and clinical management is performed according to adult 
protocols. We report, for the first time in the literature, a case of a child 
with metastatic CRC successfully treated with panitumumab associated to 
chemotherapy. Methods: A twelve-year-old male was diagnosed with CRC with nodal 
metastasis and peritoneal neoplastic effusion. After performing a genetic 
evaluation, in light of the absence of mutations in RAS family genes, 
anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody, panitumumab, 
was added to chemotherapy FOLFOXIRI. Results: The child successfully responded 
to therapy with normalization of the Carbohydrate Antigen (CA) 19.9 value after 
the third cycle of treatment. After the sixth cycle, he underwent surgery that 
consisted in sigmoid resection with complete D3 lymphadenectomy. At histological 
evaluation, no residual neoplastic cells were detectable in the surgical 
specimen. He completed 12 cycles of chemotherapy plus panitumomab and he is 
alive without disease 14 months from diagnosis. Conclusions: Our results suggest 
performing mutational screening for colorectal cancer also in the pediatric 
setting, in order to orient treatment that should include targeted therapies.
