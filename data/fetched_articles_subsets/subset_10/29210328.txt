AIM: We have previously reported an association of dihydrofolate reductase 
promoter polymorphisms with reduced event-free survival in childhood acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients treated with Dana Farber Cancer Institute 
protocol. Here, we assessed whether these associations are applicable to other 
protocol, based on different methotrexate doses.
METHODS: Genotypes for six tag polymorphisms and resulting haplotypes were 
analyzed for an association with ALL outcome.
RESULTS: The association was found with the polymorphisms A-680C, A-317G and 
C-35T in high-risk group patients. Carriers of haplotype *1 had a remarkably 
higher risk of events compared with noncarriers and a lower probability of 
event-free survival (21.4 vs 81.3%).
CONCLUSION: The role of DHFR variants in predicting the outcome of childhood ALL 
extends beyond single-treatment protocol and can be useful biomarker in 
personalizing treatment.
