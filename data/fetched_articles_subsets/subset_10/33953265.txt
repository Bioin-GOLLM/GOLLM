Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) using the inherent fluorescence of 
proteins (nDSF) is a popular technique to evaluate thermal protein stability in 
different conditions (e.g. buffer, pH). In many cases, ligand binding increases 
thermal stability of a protein and often this can be detected as a clear shift 
in nDSF experiments. Here, we evaluate binding affinity quantification based on 
thermal shifts. We present four protein systems with different binding affinity 
ligands, ranging from nM to high μM. Our study suggests that binding affinities 
determined by isothermal analysis are in better agreement with those from 
established biophysical techniques (ITC and MST) compared to apparent Kds 
obtained from melting temperatures. In addition, we describe a method to 
optionally fit the heat capacity change upon unfolding ([Formula: see text]) 
during the isothermal analysis. This publication includes the release of a web 
server for easy and accessible application of isothermal analysis to nDSF data.
