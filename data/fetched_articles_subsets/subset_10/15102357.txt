DNA mismatch repair is a postreplicative DNA repair cascade ensuring genomic 
integrity. Inactivating germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes are 
responsible for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma syndrome (HNPCC), 
which predisposes to various types of visceral cancer. Most associated tumors 
exhibit high-grade microsatellite instability. Some patients develop skin tumors 
of the sebaceous glands. This combined occurrence is known as Muir-Torre 
syndrome, which has a high probability of an underlying DNA mismatch repair 
defect. This is also true for individuals selected solely on the basis of 
sebaceous neoplasias, tumors with the highest frequency of high-grade 
microsatellite instability. This article focuses on the recent advances in 
molecular diagnostics for the detection of DNA mismatch repair defects in 
patients with sebaceous neoplasias, and the potential significance for the 
secondary prevention of visceral cancer in these patients.
