Boc and Gas1 each form distinct Shh receptor complexes with Ptch1 and are 
required for Shh-mediated cell proliferation.

Hedgehog (Hh) proteins regulate important developmental processes, including 
cell proliferation and differentiation. Although Patched acts as the main Hh 
receptor in Drosophila, Hh signaling absolutely requires the additional 
Hh-binding proteins Ihog and Boi. Here we show that, unexpectedly, cerebellar 
granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) lacking Boc and Cdon, the vertebrate 
orthologs of Ihog and Boi, still proliferate in response to Hh. This is because 
in their absence, Gas1, an Hh-binding protein not present in Drosophila, 
mediates Hh signaling. Consistently, only CGNPs lacking all three molecules-Boc, 
Cdon, and Gas1-have a complete loss of Hh-dependent proliferation. In a 
complementary manner, we find that a mutated Hh ligand that binds Patched1 but 
not Boc, Cdon, or Gas1 cannot activate Hh signaling. Together, this demonstrates 
an absolute requirement for Boc, Cdon, and Gas1 in Hh signaling and reveals a 
distinct requirement for ligand-binding components that distinguishes the 
vertebrate and invertebrate Hh receptor systems.
