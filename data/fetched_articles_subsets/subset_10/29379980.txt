PURPOSE: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and hereditary spastic ataxia (HSA) 
are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive 
lower limb spasticity resulting from pyramidal tract dysfunction. By identifying 
critical imaging findings within the clinical context of spasticity, 
radiologists are uniquely positioned to recommend specific genetic testing, and 
thus facilitate diagnosis.
METHODS: We present two examples of HSP and HSA that had gone clinically 
unrecognized for years, and in which magnetic resonance imaging played 
a critical role in the diagnosis.
RESULTS: Radiologists' awareness of HSP and HSA, combined with a critical review 
of the clinical history and characteristic imaging findings led to specific 
genetic testing and a definitive diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Awareness of HSP and HSA among radiologists will expedite more 
accurate diagnosis, explanation of patient symptoms, recommendation for 
syndrome-specific treatment, and family planning considerations.
