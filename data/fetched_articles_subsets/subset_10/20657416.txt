The interactions of 3-carboxyphenoxathiin with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 
Human Serum Albumin (HSA) have been studied by fluorescence and circular 
dichroism spectroscopy. The binding of 3-carboxyphenoxathiin quenches the BSA 
and HSA fluorescence, revealing a 1:1 interaction with a binding constant of 
about 10(5) M(-1). In addition, according to the synchronous fluorescence 
spectra of BSA and HSA in presence of 3-carboxyphenoxathiin, the tryptophan 
residues of the proteins are most perturbed by the binding process. Finally, the 
distance between the acceptor, 3-carboxyphenoxathiin, and the donor, BSA or HSA, 
was estimated on the basis of the FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The 
fluorescence results are correlated with those obtained from the circular 
dichroism spectra, which reveal the change of the albumin conformation during 
the interaction process.
