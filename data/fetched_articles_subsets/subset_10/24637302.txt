Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, also called PMA, is a small molecule that 
activates protein kinase C and functions to differentiate hematologic lineage 
cells. However, the mechanism of PMA-induced cellular differentiation is not 
fully understood. We found that PMA triggers global enhancement of protein 
ubiquitination in K562, a myelogenous leukemia cell line and one of the 
enhanced-ubiquitination targets is SnoN, an inhibitor of the Smad signaling 
pathway. Our data indicated that PMA stimulated the production of Activin A, a 
cytokine of the TGF-β family. Activin A then activated the phosphorylation of 
both Smad2 and Smad3. In consequence, SnoN is ubiquitinated by the APC(Cdh1) 
ubiquitin ligase with the help of phosphorylated Smad2. Furthermore, we found 
that SnoN proteolysis is important for the expression of CD61, a marker of 
megakaryocyte. These results indicate that protein ubiquitination promotes 
megakaryopoiesis via degrading SnoN, an inhibitor of CD61 expression, strengths 
the roles of ubiquitination in cellular differentiation.
