BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare treatment satisfaction 
among people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes after switching from insulin lispro 
to insulin aspart in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Efficacy 
of glycemic control between treatments was also investigated.
METHODS: Subjects using CSII with insulin lispro for 6 months or longer 
continued this therapy over a 4-week period and then switched to insulin aspart 
in CSII for 12 weeks. The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) 
and Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) were administered 
immediately prior to the switch and again at the end of 12 weeks of therapy with 
insulin aspart. Hemoglobin A(1c)(A1C) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, 
insulin dose, and body weight were recorded at the same time points.
RESULTS: Although average overall DTSQ score did not change significantly, 
average overall ITSQ score was significantly improved following the insulin 
aspart treatment. There was a small but statistically significant reduction in 
mean A1C and FBG following 12 weeks of CSII using insulin aspart.
CONCLUSIONS: Both insulin aspart and insulin lispro are appropriate for CSII. 
ITSQ improvements suggest that aspects of CSII therapy with insulin aspart 
positively impact treatment satisfaction.
