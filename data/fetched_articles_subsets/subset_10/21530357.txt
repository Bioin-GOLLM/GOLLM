Paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED) is a rare form of dystonia induced 
by prolonged exercise, usually involving lower limbs. PED has been recently 
described as a possible clinical manifestation of mutations of SLC2A1 gene, 
encoding for the glucose transport GLUT-1. We report a case of a young woman 
with a mild form of PED associated with self-limiting partial epilepsy. She 
carries a novel sporadic heterozygous mutation of the SLC2A1 gene. Diagnostic 
difficulties and possible treatment with carbamazepine are discussed.
