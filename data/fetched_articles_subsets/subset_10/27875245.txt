The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor known for mediating 
xenobiotic toxicity, is expressed in B cells, which are known targets for 
environmental pollutants. However, it is unclear what the physiological 
functions of AhR in B cells are. We show here that expression of Ahr in B cells 
is up-regulated upon B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement and IL-4 treatment. 
Addition of a natural ligand of AhR, FICZ, induces AhR translocation to the 
nucleus and transcription of the AhR target gene Cyp1a1, showing that the AhR 
pathway is functional in B cells. AhR-deficient (Ahr-/-) B cells proliferate 
less than AhR-sufficient (Ahr+/+) cells following in vitro BCR stimulation and 
in vivo adoptive transfer models confirmed that Ahr-/- B cells are outcompeted 
by Ahr+/+ cells. Transcriptome comparison of AhR-deficient and AhR-sufficient B 
cells identified cyclin O (Ccno), a direct target of AhR, as a top candidate 
affected by AhR deficiency.
