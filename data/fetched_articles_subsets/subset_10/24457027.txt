Many biological complexes are naturally low in abundance and pose a significant 
challenge to their structural and functional studies. Here we describe a new 
method that utilizes strong oxidation and chemical linkage to introduce a high 
density of bioactive ligands onto nanometer-thick carbon films and enable 
selective enrichment of individual macromolecular complexes at subnanogram 
levels. The introduced ligands are physically separated. Ni-NTA, Protein G and 
DNA/RNA oligonucleotides were covalently linked to the carbon surface. They 
embody negligible mass and their stability makes the functionalized films able 
to survive long-term storage and tolerate variations in pH, temperature, salts, 
detergents, and solvents. We demonstrated the application of the new method to 
the electron microscopic imaging of the substrate-bound C3PO, an RNA-processing 
enzyme important for the RNA interference pathway. On the ssRNA-linked carbon 
surface, the formation of C3PO oligomers at subnanomolar concentrations likely 
mimics their assembly onto ssRNA substrates presented by their native partners. 
Interestingly, the 3D reconstructions by negative stain EM reveal a side port in 
the C3PO/ssRNA complex, and the 15Å cryoEM map showed extra density right above 
the side port, which probably represents the ssRNA. These results suggest a new 
way for ssRNAs to interact with the active sites of the complex. Together our 
data demonstrate that the surface-engineered carbon films are suitable for 
selectively enriching low-abundance biological complexes at nanomolar level and 
for developing novel applications on a large number of surface-presented 
molecules.
