Heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can result from activation 
of distinct signaling pathways. We show that in primary human dermal fibroblasts 
(HDFs), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) 
signaling oppositely modulate multiple CAF effector genes. Genetic abrogation or 
pharmacological inhibition of either pathway results in induction of genes 
responsive to the other, with the ETV1 transcription factor mediating the FGF 
effects. Duality of FGF/TGF-β signaling and differential ETV1 expression occur 
in multiple CAF strains and fibroblasts of desmoplastic versus non-desmoplastic 
skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Functionally, HDFs with opposite TGF-β 
versus FGF modulation converge on promoting cancer cell proliferation. However, 
HDFs with increased TGF-β signaling enhance invasive properties and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of SCC cells, whereas HDFs with 
increased FGF signaling promote macrophage infiltration. The findings point to a 
duality of FGF versus TGF-β signaling in distinct CAF populations that promote 
cancer development through modulation of different processes.
