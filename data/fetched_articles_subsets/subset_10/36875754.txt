Background: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of progressive inherited 
retinal dystrophies characterized by the primary degeneration of rod 
photoreceptors and the subsequent loss of cone photoreceptors because of cell 
death. It is caused by different mechanisms, including inflammation, apoptosis, 
necroptosis, pyroptosis, and autophagy. Variants in the usherin gene (USH2A) 
have been reported in autosomal recessive RP with or without hearing loss. In 
the present study, we aimed to identify causative variants in a Han-Chinese 
pedigree with autosomal recessive RP. Methods: A six-member, three-generation 
Han-Chinese family with autosomal recessive RP was recruited. A full clinical 
examination, whole exome sequencing, and Sanger sequencing, as well as 
co-segregation analysis were performed. Results: Three heterozygous variants in 
the USH2A gene, c.3304C>T (p.Q1102*), c.4745T>C (p.L1582P), and c.14740G>A 
(p.E4914K), were identified in the proband, which were inherited from parents 
and transmitted to the daughters. Bioinformatics analysis supported the 
pathogenicity of the c.3304C>T (p.Q1102*) and c.4745T>C (p.L1582P) variants. 
Conclusions: Novel compound heterozygous variants in the USH2A gene, c.3304C>T 
(p.Q1102*) and c.4745T>C (p.L1582P), were identified as the genetic causes of 
autosomal recessive RP. The findings may enhance the current knowledge of the 
pathogenesis of USH2A-associated phenotypes, expand the spectrum of the USH2A 
gene variants, and contribute to improved genetic counseling, prenatal 
diagnosis, and disease management.
