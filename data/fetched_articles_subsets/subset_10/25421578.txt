Clear-cell renal cell cancer (CRCC) is initiated typically by loss of the 
tumor-suppressor VHL, driving constitutive activation of hypoxia-inducible 
factor-1 (HIF1) and HIF2. However, whereas HIF1 has a tumor-suppressor role, 
HIF2 plays a distinct role in driving CRCC. In this study, we show that the 
HIF1α E3 ligase hypoxia-associated factor (HAF) complexes with HIF2α at DNA to 
promote HIF2-dependent transcription through a mechanism relying upon HAF 
SUMOylation. HAF SUMOylation was induced by hypoxia, whereas HAF-mediated HIF1α 
degradation was SUMOylation independent. HAF overexpression in mice increased 
CRCC growth and metastasis. Clinically, HAF overexpression was associated with 
poor prognosis. Taken together, our results show that HAF is a specific mediator 
of HIF2 activation that is critical for CRCC development and morbidity.
