BACKGROUND: Generalist herbivores such as the two-spotted spider mite 
Tetranychus urticae thrive on a wide variety of plants and can rapidly adapt to 
novel hosts. What traits enable polyphagous herbivores to cope with the 
diversity of secondary metabolites in their variable plant diet is unclear. 
Genome sequencing of T. urticae revealed the presence of 17 genes that code for 
secreted proteins with strong homology to "intradiol ring cleavage dioxygenases 
(DOGs)" from bacteria and fungi, and phylogenetic analyses show that they have 
been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from fungi. In bacteria and fungi, 
DOGs have been well characterized and cleave aromatic rings in catecholic 
compounds between adjacent hydroxyl groups. Such compounds are found in high 
amounts in solanaceous plants like tomato, where they protect against herbivory. 
To better understand the role of this gene family in spider mites, we used a 
multi-disciplinary approach to functionally characterize the various T. urticae 
DOG genes.
RESULTS: We confirmed that DOG genes were present in the T. urticae genome and 
performed a phylogenetic reconstruction using transcriptomic and genomic data to 
advance our understanding of the evolutionary history of spider mite DOG genes. 
We found that DOG expression differed between mites from different plant hosts 
and was induced in response to jasmonic acid defense signaling. In consonance 
with a presumed role in detoxification, expression was localized in the mite's 
gut region. Silencing selected DOGs expression by dsRNA injection reduced the 
mites' survival rate on tomato, further supporting a role in mitigating the 
plant defense response. Recombinant purified DOGs displayed a broad substrate 
promiscuity, cleaving a surprisingly wide array of aromatic plant metabolites, 
greatly exceeding the metabolic capacity of previously characterized microbial 
DOGs.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the laterally acquired spider mite DOGs 
function as detoxification enzymes in the gut, disarming plant metabolites 
before they reach toxic levels. We provide experimental evidence to support the 
hypothesis that this proliferated gene family in T. urticae is causally linked 
to its ability to feed on an extremely wide range of host plants.
