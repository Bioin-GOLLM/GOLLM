AIM: The present study explored the integrative effect of genes encoding 
methadone pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways on methadone maintenance 
doses in Han Chinese Patients.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from 321 opioid-dependent 
patients and 202 healthy controls, and realtime-PCR and PCR-RFLP were conducted 
to determine the genotypes.
RESULTS: Pair-wise comparisons revealed that carriers of the variants ABCB1 
3435C>T or CYP2B6 516G>T alleles were more likely to require a higher methadone 
dose than noncarriers (both p < 0.0001). On the other hand, carriers of the 
variant DRD2 -214A>G or 939C>T allele had a twofold chance of requiring a lower 
methadone dose than noncarriers (p = 0.001). Proportional odds regression with 
adjustment of cofactors demonstrated that ABCB1, CYP2B6, OPRM1, ANKK1 and DRD2 
genetic variants were jointly correlated with optimal methadone dose (adjusted 
r(2) = 53%).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new insight to the fact that the 
interindividual variability of methadone dosage requirement is polygenetic and 
cannot be explained by a single-gene effect.
