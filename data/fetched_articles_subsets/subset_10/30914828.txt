Intellectual disability (ID), megalencephaly, frontal predominant pachygyria, 
and seizures, previously called "thin" lissencephaly, are reported to be caused 
by recessive variants in CRADD. Among five families of different ethnicities 
identified, one homozygous missense variant, c.509G>A p.(Arg170His), was of 
Finnish ancestry. Here we report on the phenotypic variability associated for 
this potential CRADD founder variant in 22 Finnish individuals. Exome sequencing 
was used to identify candidate genes in Finnish patients presenting with ID. 
Targeted Sanger sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis were applied to 
screen for the c.509G>A CRADD variant in cohorts from Finland. Detailed 
phenotyping and genealogical studies were performed. Twenty two patients were 
identified with the c.509G>A p.(Arg170His) homozygous variant in CRADD. The 
majority of the ancestors originated from Northeastern Finland indicating a 
founder effect. The hallmark of the disease is frontotemporal predominant 
pachygyria with mild cortical thickening. All patients show ID of variable 
severity. Aggressive behavior was found in nearly half of the patients, EEG 
abnormalities in five patients and megalencephaly in three patients. This study 
provides detailed data about the phenotypic spectrum of patients with 
lissencephaly due to a CRADD variant that affects function. High inter- and 
intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity was identified in patients with 
pachygyria caused by the homozygous CRADD founder variant. The phenotype 
variability suggests that additional genetic and/or environmental factors play a 
role in the clinical presentation. Since frontotemporal pachygyria is the 
hallmark of the disease, brain imaging studies are essential to support the 
molecular diagnosis for individuals with ID and a CRADD variant.
