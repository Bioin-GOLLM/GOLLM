The iron-regulated protein FrpD from Neisseria meningitidis is an outer membrane 
lipoprotein that interacts with very high affinity (Kd ~ 0.2 nM) with the 
N-terminal domain of FrpC, a Type I-secreted protein from the Repeat in ToXin 
(RTX) protein family. In the presence of Ca2+, FrpC undergoes Ca2+ -dependent 
protein trans-splicing that includes an autocatalytic cleavage of the 
Asp414-Pro415 peptide bond and formation of an Asp414-Lys isopeptide bond. Here, 
we report the high-resolution structure of FrpD and describe the 
structure-function relationships underlying the interaction between FrpD and 
FrpC1-414. We identified FrpD residues involved in FrpC1-414 binding, which 
enabled localization of FrpD within the low-resolution SAXS model of the 
FrpD-FrpC1-414 complex. Moreover, the trans-splicing activity of FrpC resulted 
in covalent linkage of the FrpC1-414 fragment to plasma membrane proteins of 
epithelial cells in vitro, suggesting that formation of the FrpD-FrpC1-414 
complex may be involved in the interaction of meningococci with the host cell 
surface.
