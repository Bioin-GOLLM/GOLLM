HLA-G is an immune checkpoint molecule with immunosuppressive and 
anti-inflammatory activities, and its expression and level of its soluble form 
(sHLA-G) may play an important role in tumor prognosis. The HLA-G 14bp ins/del 
polymorphism and the plasma level of soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) were investigated by 
a polymerase chain reaction and ELISA, respectively, in 59 glioma patients. A 
significantly higher proportion of glioma patients had the 14 nt insert in both 
homozygous and heterozygous states compared to the control group. Glioma 
patients also had higher plasma levels of sHLA-G. Patients with methylated MGMT 
promoters had lower levels of sHLA-G than those with unmethylated MGMT 
promoters. The level of sHLA-G negatively correlated with the overall survival 
of patients. Glioblastoma patients who survived more than one year after 
diagnosis had lower levels of sHLA-G than those surviving less than one year. 
Patients with sHLA-G levels below the cut-off value of 40 U/mL survived 
significantly longer than patients with sHLA-G levels above 40 U/mL. The levels 
of sHLA-G were also negatively correlated with the level of IL-6 (p = 0.0004) 
and positively with IL-10/IL-6 (p = 0.046). Conclusion: The presence of the 14 
nt insert in both homozygous and heterozygous states of the HLA-G 14bp ins/del 
polymorphism is more frequent in glioma patients and the elevated plasma levels 
of sHLA-G are negatively associated with their survival.
