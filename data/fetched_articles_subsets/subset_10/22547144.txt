As a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonist, 
fenofibrate favorably modulates dyslipidemia and inflammation markers, which are 
associated with cardiovascular risk. To determine whether variation in the PPARα 
receptor gene was associated with lipid and inflammatory marker response, we 
conducted a 3-week trial of fenofibrate in 861 men and women. Mixed linear 
models that controlled for age and sex, as well as family pedigree and study 
center, were constructed using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 
PPARα gene as predictors and changes in fasting triglycerides (TGs), cholesterol 
and inflammatory markers as outcomes. Significant associations with low-density 
cholesterol and interleukin-2 (P<0.001) responses to fenofibrate were found. 
Although there were suggestive associations with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and 
TG responses (P<0.05), these did not survive the correction for multiple 
testing. We conclude that variants in the PPARα gene may contribute to future 
pharmacogenomic paradigms seeking to predict fenofibrate responders from both an 
anti-dyslipidemic and anti-inflammatory perspective.
