In humans, associative memories are more susceptible to age-related cognitive 
decline (ARCD) than are recognition memories. Reduced cAMP/cGMP signaling in the 
hippocampus may contribute to ARCD. Here, we found that both aging and traumatic 
brain injury-associated dementia increased the expression of the 
cAMP/cGMP-degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A) in the human 
hippocampus. Further, age-related increases in hippocampal PDE11A4 mRNA and 
protein were conserved in mice, as was the increased vulnerability of 
associative versus recognition memories to ARCD. Interestingly, mouse PDE11A4 
protein in the aged ventral hippocampus (VHIPP) ectopically accumulated in the 
membrane fraction and filamentous structures we term "ghost axons." These 
age-related increases in expression were driven by reduced 
exoribonuclease-mediated degradation of PDE11A mRNA and increased 
PDE11A4-pS117/pS124, the latter of which also drove the punctate accumulation of 
PDE11A4. In contrast, PDE11A4-pS162 caused dispersal. Importantly, preventing 
age-related increases in PDE11 expression via genetic deletion protected mice 
from ARCD of short-term and remote long-term associative memory (aLTM) in the 
social transmission of food preference assay, albeit at the expense of recent 
aLTM. Further, mimicking age-related overexpression of PDE11A4 in CA1 of old KO 
mice caused aging-like impairments in CREB function and remote social-but not 
non-social-LTMs. RNA sequencing and phosphoproteomic analyses of VHIPP 
identified cGMP-PKG-as opposed to cAMP-PKA-as well as circadian entrainment, 
glutamatergic/cholinergic synapses, calcium signaling, oxytocin, and retrograde 
endocannabinoid signaling as mechanisms by which PDE11A deletion protects 
against ARCD. Together, these data suggest that PDE11A4 proteinopathies acutely 
impair signaling in the aged brain and contribute to ARCD of social memories.
