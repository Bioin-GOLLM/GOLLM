Congenital hearing loss is the most common birth defect, estimated to affect 2-3 
in every 1000 births. Currently there is no cure for hearing loss. Treatment 
options are limited to hearing aids for mild and moderate cases, and cochlear 
implants for severe and profound hearing loss. Here we provide a literature 
overview of the environmental and genetic causes of congenital hearing loss, 
common animal models and methods used for hearing research, as well as recent 
advances towards developing therapies to treat congenital deafness. © 2021 The
