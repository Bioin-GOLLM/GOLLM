Microglia from different nervous system regions are molecularly and anatomically 
distinct, but whether they also have different functions is unknown. We combined 
lineage tracing, single-cell transcriptomics, and electrophysiology of the mouse 
retina and showed that adult retinal microglia shared a common developmental 
lineage and were long-lived but resided in two distinct niches. Microglia in 
these niches differed in their interleukin-34 dependency and functional 
contribution to visual-information processing. During certain 
retinal-degeneration models, microglia from both pools relocated to the 
subretinal space, an inducible disease-associated niche that was poorly 
accessible to monocyte-derived cells. This microglial transition involved 
transcriptional reprogramming of microglia, characterized by reduced expression 
of homeostatic checkpoint genes and upregulation of injury-responsive genes. 
This transition was associated with protection of the retinal pigmented 
epithelium from damage caused by disease. Together, our data demonstrate that 
microglial function varies by retinal niche, thereby shedding light on the 
significance of microglia heterogeneity.
