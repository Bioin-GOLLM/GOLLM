OBJECTIVES: Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungus that causes fatal 
meningoencephalitis especially in AIDS patients. There is an increasing need for 
discovery of new anti-cryptococcal drugs due to emergence of resistance cases in 
recent years. In this study, we aim to elucidate the antifungal effect of 
triclosan against C. neoformans.
METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of triclosan in different C. 
neoformans strains was first examined. The in vitro interactions between 
triclosan and two standard anti-fungal drugs (amphotericin B and fluconazole) 
were further evaluated by microdilution checkerboard assay. Mechanism of 
triclosan fungicidal activity was then investigated by viewing the cell 
morphology under transmission electron microscope.
RESULTS: We reported that triclosan potently inhibited the growth of C. 
neoformans. A combination of triclosan with amphotericin B or with fluconazole 
enhanced their fungicidal effects. Triclosan-treated C. neoformans displayed 
characteristics such as nuclear chromatin condensation, extensive intracellular 
vacuolation and mitochondrial swelling, indicating that triclosan triggered 
apoptosis-like cell death.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our report suggests triclosan as an independent drug or 
synergent for C. neoformans treatment.
