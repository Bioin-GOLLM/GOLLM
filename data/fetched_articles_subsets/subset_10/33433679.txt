Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a neurocristopathy characterized by the absence 
of enteric ganglia along variable lengths of the intestine. Genetic defects play 
a major role in HSCR pathogenesis with nearly 50% of patients having a 
structural or regulatory deficiency in the major susceptibility gene RET. 
However, complete molecular defects remain poorly characterized in most 
patients. Here, we performed detailed genetic, molecular, and populational 
investigations of rare null mutations and modifiers at the RET locus. We first 
verified the pathogenicity of three RET splice site mutants (c.1879 + 1G > A, 
c.2607 + 5G > A and c.2608-3C > G) at the RNA level. We also identified 
significantly higher risk allele (genotype) frequencies, and their 
over-transmission, from unaffected parents to affected offspring of three 
functionally independent enhancer variants (rs2506030, rs7069590 and rs2435357, 
with odd ratios (OR) of 2.09, 2.71 and 7.59, respectively, P < 0.001). These 
three common variants are in significant (P < 4.64 × 10-186) linkage 
disequilibrium in the Han Chinese population with ~ 60% of them carrying at 
least one copy and > 10% with two copies. We show that RET compound inheritance 
of rare and common variants prevails in 64% (seven out of 11) of Chinese HSCR 
families. This study supports the idea that common RET variants can modify the 
penetrance of rare null RET mutations in HSCR, and the combined high 
susceptibility allele dosage may constitute the unique raised "risk baseline" 
among the Chinese population.
