BACKGROUND: Adhesion of leukocytes to the extracellular matrix and to other 
cells is mediated by members of the integrin family of adhesion molecules. Src 
family kinases are activated upon integrin-mediated adhesion. In lymphocytes, 
CD45 is a leukocyte-specific transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase that 
activates Src family kinases associated with B-cell and T-cell antigen receptor 
signaling by constitutive dephosphorylation of the inhibitory carboxy-terminal 
tyrosine phosphorylation site. Here, we show that CD45 is also important in 
downregulating the kinase activity of Src family members during 
integrin-mediated adhesion in macrophages.
RESULTS: We found that CD45 colocalized with beta2 integrin and the Src family 
kinase p53/56(lyn) to adhesion sites in bone marrow-derived macrophages. 
Macrophages from CD45(-/-) mice were unable to maintain integrin-mediated 
adhesion. In adherent macrophages, absence of CD45 led to the 
hyperphosphorylation and hyperactivation of p56/59(hck) and p53/56(lyn), but not 
of p58(c-fgr). CD45 directly inactivated p59(hck) but not p56(lck) in transient 
transfection assays. Furthermore, coexpression of CD45 with p59(hck) or p56(lyn) 
containing a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at the carboxy-terminal negative 
regulatory site resulted in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the Src family 
member kinases due to dephosphorylation of the potentiating tyrosine 
phosphorylation site within the kinase domain.
CONCLUSIONS: Using primary bone marrow macrophages, these studies demonstrate 
that CD45 regulates Src family kinases and is required to maintain macrophage 
adhesion. CD45 decreases Src family kinase activity by dephosphorylating the 
tyrosine residue located within the kinase domain.
