For several decades, we have known that epigenetic regulation is disrupted in 
cancer. Recently, an increasing body of data suggests epigenetics might be an 
intersection of current cancer research trends: next generation sequencing, 
immunology, metabolomics, and cell aging. The new emphasis on epigenetics is 
also related to the increasing production of drugs capable of interfering with 
epigenetic mechanisms and able to trigger clinical responses in even advanced 
phase patients. In this review, we will use myeloid malignancies as proof of 
concept examples of how epigenetic mechanisms can trigger or promote 
oncogenesis. We will also show how epigenetic mechanisms are related to genetic 
aberrations, and how they affect other systems, like immune response. Finally, 
we will show how we can try to influence the fate of cancer cells with 
epigenetic therapy.
