Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), when ruptured, results in high mortality. The 
identification of molecular pathways involved in AAA progression is required to 
improve AAA prognosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the key genes 
for the progression of AAA and their functional role. Genomic and clinical data 
of three independent cohorts were downloaded from the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE57691, 
GSE7084, and GSE98278). To develop AAA diagnosis and progression-related 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we used a significance analysis of 
microarray (SAM). Spearman correlation test and gene set analysis were performed 
to identify potential enriched pathways for DEGs. Only the Frizzled-related 
protein (FRZB) gene and chromosome 1 open reading frame 24 (C1orf24) exhibited 
significant down-regulation in all analyses. With FRZB, the pathways were 
associated with RHO GTPase and elastin fiber formation. With C1orf24, the 
pathways were elastic fiber formation, extracellular matrix organization, and 
cell-cell communication. Since only FRZB was evolutionally conserved in the 
vertebrates, function of FRZB was validated using zebrafish embryos. Knockdown 
of frzb remarkably reduced vascular integrity in zebrafish embryos. We believe 
that FRZB is a key gene involved in AAA initiation and progression affecting 
vascular integrity.
