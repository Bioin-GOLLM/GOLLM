Despite the fact that ribosomal proteins are the constituents of an organelle 
that is present in every cell, they show a surprising level of regulation, and 
several of them have also been shown to have other extra-ribosomal functions, 
such in replication, transcription, splicing or even ageing. This review 
provides a comprehensive summary of these important aspects.
