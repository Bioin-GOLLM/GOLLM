The octapeptide sequence of peptide T is contained within the envelope of HIV 
and seems to mediate the viral binding to CD4 expressing cells, including 
monocytes. The biological activity of the alpha-aminobutyric acid pentapeptide 
derived from the C-terminal sequence of peptide T, in which the polar side chain 
of threonine in position 4 is substituted by a hydrophilic group, is measured by 
the monocyte chemotaxis assay. The chemotactic activity of human monocytes is 
assessed by determining the concentration at which the pentapeptide analog is 
maximally active and the effectiveness at that concentration, in comparison with 
peptide T and two shorter homologs, the pentapeptide and tetrapeptide. These 
experiments suggest that the synthetic analog is a potent chemotactic factor 
active at picomolar concentrations and that it competes with peptide T for the 
monocyte binding site.
