Cantú syndrome (CS), characterized by hypertrichosis, distinctive facial 
features, and complex cardiovascular abnormalities, is caused by pathogenic 
variants in ABCC9 and KCNJ8 genes. These genes encode gain-of-function mutations 
in the regulatory (SUR2) and pore-forming (Kir6.1) subunits of KATP channels, 
respectively, suggesting that channel-blocking sulfonylureas could be a viable 
therapy. Here we report a neonate with CS, carrying a heterozygous ABCC9 variant 
(c.3347G>A, p.Arg1116His), born prematurely at 32 weeks gestation. Initial 
echocardiogram revealed a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and high 
pulmonary pressures with enlarged right ventricle. He initially received 
surfactant and continuous positive airway pressure ventilation and was 
invasively ventilated for 4 weeks, until PDA ligation. After surgery, he still 
had ongoing bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) requirement, but was 
subsequently weaned to nocturnal BiPAP. He was treated for pulmonary 
hypertension with Sildenafil, but failed to make further clinical improvement. A 
therapeutic glibenclamide trial was commenced in week 11 (initial dose of 
0.05 mg-1 kg-1 day-1 in two divided doses). After 1 week of treatment, he began 
to tolerate time off BiPAP when awake, and edema improved. Glibenclamide was 
well tolerated, and the dose was slowly increased to 0.15 mg-1 kg-1 day-1 over 
the next 12 weeks. Mild transient hypoglycemia was observed, but there was no 
cardiovascular dysfunction. Confirmation of therapeutic benefit will require 
studies of more CS patients but, based on this limited experience, consideration 
should be given to glibenclamide as CS therapy, although problems associated 
with prematurity, and complications of hypoglycemia, might limit outcome in 
critically ill neonates with CS.
