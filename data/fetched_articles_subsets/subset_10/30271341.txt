Globally, gastric malignancy contributes to significant cancer-related morbidity 
and mortality. Despite a recent approval of two targeted agents, trastuzumab and 
ramucirumab, the treatment options for advanced-stage gastric cancer are 
limited. Consequently, the overall clinical outcomes for patients with 
advanced-stage gastric cancer remain poor. Numerous agents that are active 
against novel targets have been evaluated in the course of randomized trials; 
however, most have produced disappointing results because of the molecular 
heterogeneity of gastric cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project proposed 
a new classification system for gastric cancer that includes four different 
tumor subtypes based on molecular characteristics. This change led to the 
identification of several distinct and potentially targetable pathways. However, 
most agents targeting these pathways do not elicit any meaningful clinical 
benefit when employed for the treatment of advanced-stage gastric cancer. Most 
advanced-stage gastric cancer trials currently focus on agents that modulate 
tumor microenvironments and cancer cell stemness. In this review, we summarize 
data regarding novel compounds that have shown efficacy in early phase studies 
and show promise as effective therapeutic agents, with special emphasis on those 
for which phase III trials are either planned or underway.
