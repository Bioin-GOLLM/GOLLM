The maintenance of mitochondrial function is closely linked to the control of 
senescence. In our previous study, we uncovered a novel mechanism in which 
senescence amelioration in normal aging cells is mediated by the recovered 
mitochondrial function upon Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibition. 
However, it remains elusive whether this mechanism is also applicable to 
senescence amelioration in accelerated aging cells. In this study, we examined 
the role of ATM inhibition on mitochondrial function in Hutchinson-Gilford 
progeria syndrome (HGPS) and Werner syndrome (WS) cells. We found that ATM 
inhibition induced mitochondrial functional recovery accompanied by metabolic 
reprogramming, which has been known to be a prerequisite for senescence 
alleviation in normal aging cells. Indeed, the induced mitochondrial metabolic 
reprogramming was coupled with senescence amelioration in accelerated aging 
cells. Furthermore, the therapeutic effect via ATM inhibition was observed in 
HGPS as evidenced by reduced progerin accumulation with concomitant decrease of 
abnormal nuclear morphology. Taken together, our data indicate that the 
mitochondrial functional recovery by ATM inhibition might represent a promising 
strategy to ameliorate the accelerated aging phenotypes and to treat age-related 
disease.
