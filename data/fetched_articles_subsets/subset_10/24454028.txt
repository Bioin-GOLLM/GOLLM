The complete molecule of the title compound, [Cu2(C2H3O2)2(CF3O3S)2(C12H8N2)2], 
is completed by the application of a twofold rotation and comprises two Cu(II) 
ions, each of which is penta-coordinated by two N atoms from a bidentate 
1,10-phenanthroline (phen) ligand, two O atoms from acetate ligands and an O 
atom from a tri-fluoro-methane-sulfonate anion, forming a (4 + 1) distorted 
square-pyramidal coordination geometry. The Cu(II) ions are connected by two 
acetate bridges in a syn-syn configuration. The F atoms of the 
tri-fluoro-methane-sulfonate ligands are disordered, with site-occupation 
factors of 70 and 30. The molecular structure is stabilized by intra-molecular 
face-to-face π-π inter-actions with centroid-centroid distances in the range 
3.5654 (12)-3.8775(12) Å. The crystal structure is stabilized by C-H⋯O 
interactions, leading to a three-dimensional lattice structure.
