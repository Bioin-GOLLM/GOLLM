INTRODUCTION: Taxol (Tx), a microtubule-stabilizing drug, has been widely used 
as a chemotherapeutic in several types of cancer. However, the development of 
resistance limited its application. One of the strategies used to prevent the 
emergence of drug resistance is combination treatment, involving at least two 
drugs. The aim of the current study was to assess if a new uracil analog, 
3-p-bromophenyl-1-ethyl-5-methylidenedihydrouracil (U-359) can prevent the 
development of Tx resistance in breast cancer cells.
METHODS: The cytotoxicity of the new drug was tested in MCF-7 (hormone receptor 
(ER, PR) positive cell-line) and MCF-10A cell lines using MTT method. For the 
detection of apoptosis and necrosis, the Wright and Giemsa staining was used. 
Gene expression was measured by real-time PCR, and changes in the protein levels 
were evaluated by ELISA and bioluminescent method.
RESULTS: We investigated the effect of Tx and U-359 on cancer MCF-7 and normal 
MCF-10A cells alone and in combination. Tx co-administered with U-359 inhibited 
proliferation of MCF-7 cells to 7% while the level of ATPase drastically 
decreased to 14%, compared with effects produced by Tx alone. The apoptosis 
process was induced through the mitochondrial pathway. These effects were not 
seen in MCF-10A cells, showing the wide safety margin. The obtained results have 
shown that U-359 produced a synergistic effect with Tx probably by reducing Tx 
resistance in MCF-7 cells. To elucidate the possible mechanism of resistance, 
expression of tubulin III (TUBIII), responsible for microtubule stabilization 
and tau and Nlp proteins, responsible for microtubule dynamics, was assessed.
CONCLUSION: Combination of Tx with U-359 reduced overexpression of TUBIII and 
Nlp. Thus, U-359 may stand for a potential reversal agent for the treatment of 
MDR in cancer cells.
