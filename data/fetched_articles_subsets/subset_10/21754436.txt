The title solvated molecular salt, C(4)H(12)N(2) (2+)·C(7)H(3)NO(4) (2-)·CH(3)OH 
or (pipzH(2))(py-2,3-dc)·MeOH, was prepared by the reaction of 
pyridine-2,3-dicarb-oxy-lic acid (py-2,3-dcH(2)) and piperazine (pipz) in 
methanol (MeOH) as solvent. One of the two carboxylate groups of the acid 
fragment is nearly perpendicular to the pyridine ring and the other is almost in 
its plane [C-C-C-O torsion angles = -85.50 (11) and 88.07 (11)° and N-C-C-O 
torsion angles = -176.31 (8) and 5.41 (13)°]. In the crystal, the components are 
linked by O-H⋯O, N-H⋯O and C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, generating a three-dimensional 
network.
