First identified as a viral defense mechanism, clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) has been 
transformed into a gene-editing tool. It now affords promise in the treatment 
and potential eradication of a range of divergent genetic, cancer, infectious, 
and degenerative diseases. Adapting CRISPR-Cas into a programmable endonuclease 
directed guide RNA (gRNA) has attracted international attention. It was recently 
awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The limitations of this technology 
have also been identified and work has been made in providing potential 
remedies. For treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1), in 
particular, a CRISPR-Cas9 approach was adapted to target then eliminate latent 
proviral DNA. To this end, we reviewed the promise and perils of CRISPR-Cas 
gene-editing strategies for HIV-1 elimination. Obstacles include precise 
delivery to reservoir tissue and cell sites of latent HIV-1 as well as assay 
sensitivity and specificity. The detection and consequent excision of common 
viral strain sequences and the avoidance of off-target activity will serve to 
facilitate a final goal of HIV-1 DNA elimination and accelerate testing in 
infected animals ultimately for use in man.
