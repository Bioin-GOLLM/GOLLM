A comprehensive characterization of regulatory elements in the chicken genome 
across tissues will have substantial impacts on both fundamental and applied 
research. Here, we systematically identified and characterized regulatory 
elements in the chicken genome by integrating 377 genome-wide sequencing 
datasets from 23 adult tissues. In total, we annotated 1.57 million regulatory 
elements, representing 15 distinct chromatin states, and predicted about 1.2 
million enhancer-gene pairs and 7662 super-enhancers. This functional annotation 
of the chicken genome should have wide utility on identifying regulatory 
elements accounting for gene regulation underlying domestication, selection, and 
complex trait regulation, which we explored. In short, this comprehensive atlas 
of regulatory elements provides the scientific community with a valuable 
resource for chicken genetics and genomics.
