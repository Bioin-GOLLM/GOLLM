BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and HIV are independently 
associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the factors associated 
with NAFLD in persons living with HIV (PWH) and whether CVD is more frequent in 
PWH with NAFLD are currently unknown.
METHODS: From the Partners HealthCare Research Patient Data Registry, we 
identified PWH with and without NAFLD between 2010 and 2017. NAFLD was defined 
using validated histological or radiographic criteria. CVD was defined by an 
ICD-9 diagnosis of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, coronary 
revascularization, peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, transient 
ischemic attack, or stroke and was confirmed by clinician review. Multivariable 
logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between NAFLD and 
CVD.
RESULTS: Compared with PWH without NAFLD (n = 135), PWH with NAFLD (n = 97) had 
higher body mass index and more frequently had hypertension, obstructive sleep 
apnea, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and CVD (P < 
0.01 for all). PWH with NAFLD were also more likely to have CD4 T-cell counts 
(CD4) <200 cells/mm. In multivariable models, the presence of NAFLD was 
significantly associated with CVD (adjusted odds ratio 3.08, 95% confidence 
interval: 1.37 to 6.94) and CD4 <200 cells/mm (adjusted odds ratio 4.49, 95% 
confidence interval: 1.74 to 11.55).
CONCLUSION: In PWH, CVD was independently associated with prevalent NAFLD after 
controlling for traditional CVD risk factors. NAFLD was also associated with CD4 
<200 cells/mm, suggesting that immune dysfunction may be related to NAFLD. Both 
CVD and low CD4 count as risk factors for NAFLD require prospective evaluation.
