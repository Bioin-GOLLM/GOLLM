Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifarious neurodegenerative disease. Its 
pathology is characterized by a prominent early death of dopaminergic neurons in 
the pars compacta of the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies with 
aggregated α-synuclein. Although the α-synuclein pathological aggregation and 
propagation, induced by several factors, is considered one of the most relevant 
hypotheses, PD pathogenesis is still a matter of debate. Indeed, environmental 
factors and genetic predisposition play an important role in PD. Mutations 
associated with a high risk for PD, usually called monogenic PD, underlie 5% to 
10% of all PD cases. However, this percentage tends to increase over time 
because of the continuous identification of new genes associated with PD. The 
identification of genetic variants that can cause or increase the risk of PD has 
also given researchers the possibility to explore new personalized therapies. In 
this narrative review, we discuss the recent advances in the treatment of 
genetic forms of PD, focusing on different pathophysiologic aspects and ongoing 
clinical trials.
