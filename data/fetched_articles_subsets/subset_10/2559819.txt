Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant genetic 
disease, and the major component of the amyloid fibrils from FAP patients was 
shown to be variants of transthyretin (TTR) with single amino acid 
substitutions. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the TTR cDNA and its 
corresponding gene enabled us to detect the base substitutions responsible for 
the variant TTR by conventional Southern blotting or polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) method and allowed us to screen a number of FAP families in Japan. Among 
seven TTR variants related to FAP, all the FAP patients tested in Japan had the 
particular 30Val----Met mutation. Haplotype analysis revealed that the 
Val----Met mutation has recurred frequently in the population to generate the 
FAP families of independent origins. Although the primary cause of FAP has 
become clear, extensive screening of FAP families revealed that there existed 
late onset cases and also patients with atypical symptoms in FAP families with 
the Val----Met mutation, suggesting that the expression of FAP is a complex 
process and affected by some (unknown) factors other than TTR.
