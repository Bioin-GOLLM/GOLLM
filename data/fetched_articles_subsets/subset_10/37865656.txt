Bassoon (BSN) is a component of a hetero-dimeric presynaptic cytomatrix protein 
that orchestrates neurotransmitter release with Piccolo (PCLO) from 
glutamatergic neurons throughout the brain. Heterozygous missense variants in 
BSN have previously been associated with neurodegenerative disorders in humans. 
We performed an exome-wide association analysis of ultra-rare variants in about 
140,000 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank to search for new genes 
associated with obesity. We found that rare heterozygous predicted loss of 
function (pLoF) variants in BSN are associated with higher BMI with p-value of 
3.6e-12 in the UK biobank cohort. Additionally, we identified two individuals 
(one of whom has a de novo variant) with a heterozygous pLoF variant in a cohort 
of early onset or extreme obesity and report the clinical histories of these 
individuals with non-syndromic obesity with no history of neurobehavioral or 
cognitive disability. The BMI association was replicated in the All of Us whole 
genome sequencing data. Heterozygous pLoF BSN variants constitute a new etiology 
for obesity.
