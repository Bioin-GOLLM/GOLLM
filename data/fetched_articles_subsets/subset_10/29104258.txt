Resveratrol (RVT) is one of the main natural compounds studied worldwide due to 
its potential therapeutic use in the treatment of many diseases, including 
cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and 
metabolic disorders. Nevertheless, the mechanism of action of RVT in all of 
these conditions is not completely understood, as it can modify not only 
biochemical pathways but also epigenetic mechanisms. In this paper, we analyze 
the biological activities exhibited by RVT with a focus on the epigenetic 
mechanisms, especially those related to DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), histone 
deacetylase (HDAC) and lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1).
