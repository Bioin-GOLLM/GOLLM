Brain metastases are the most common malignancy encountered in the central 
nervous system (CNS), with up to 30-40% of cancer patients developing brain 
metastases at some point during the course of their disease. The management of 
brain metastasis is rapidly evolving and the roles of local therapies such as 
whole-brain radiation therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and resection along 
with systemic therapies are in flux. An emphasis on the neurocognitive side 
effects associated with treatment has gained prominence. Novel molecular studies 
have demonstrated important evolutionary patterns underpinning the development 
of brain metastasis and leptomeningeal disease, which may be key to unlocking 
new therapeutic strategies. This article provides a framework for incorporating 
the results of recent randomized radiotherapy clinical trials into practice, 
expounds upon the emphasis on cognition being an important driver in therapeutic 
selection, describes the importance of CNS-penetrating systemic therapies, and 
provides an overview of the novel molecular insights that will likely set the 
stage for future developments in this field.
