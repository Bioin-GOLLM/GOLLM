A case of collision tumors occurring between two distinct primary brain tumors 
is reported. A 61-year-old female without history of radiotherapy or 
phakomatosis presented with progressive ly increasing headache and left 
hemiparesis. Investigation revealed a meningioma and a Grade II astrocytoma in 
the right frontal lobe. Simultaneous development of a meningioma and a low-grade 
glioma at adjacent sites is extremely rare. This is the third case reported in 
the literature. Some hypotheses are proposed to explain this phenomenon but most 
likely represent a coincidental event.
