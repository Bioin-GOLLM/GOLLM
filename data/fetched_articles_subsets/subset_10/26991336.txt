AIMS: Using a model-based approach, the efavirenz steady-state pharmacokinetics 
in African children is characterized, quantifying demographic and genotypic 
effects on the drug's disposition. Simulations are also conducted allowing 
prediction of optimized doses of efavirenz in this population.
METHODS: We modelled the steady-state population pharmacokinetics of efavirenz 
in Ugandan and Zambian children using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. 
Individual mid-dose efavirenz concentrations were derived and simulations 
explored genotype-based dose optimization strategies.
RESULTS: A two-compartment model with absorption through transit compartments 
well described 2086 concentration-time points in 169 children. The combined 
effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 516G>T and 983T>C explained 
44.5% and 14.7% of the variability in efavirenz clearance and bioavailability, 
respectively. The detected frequencies of composite CYP2B6 genotype were 0.33 
for 516GG|983TT, 0.35 for 516GT|983TT, 0.06 for 516GG|983TC, 0.18 for 
516TT|983TT, 0.07 516GT|983TC and 0.01 for 516GG|983CC. The corresponding 
estimated clearance rates were 6.94, 4.90, 3.93, 1.92, 1.36, and 0.74 l h(-1) 
for a 15.4 kg child and median (95% CI) observed mid-dose concentrations 1.55 
(0.51-2.94), 2.20 (0.97-4.40), 2.03 (1.19-4.53), 7.55 (2.40-14.74), 7.79 
(3.66-24.59) and 18.22 (11.84-22.76) mg l(-1) , respectively. Simulations showed 
that wild-type individuals had exposures at the bottom of therapeutic range, 
while slower metabolizers were overexposed.
CONCLUSIONS: Dosage guidelines for African children should take into 
consideration the combined effect of SNPs CYP2B6 516G>T and 983T>C.
