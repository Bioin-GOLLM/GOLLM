BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 CYP2C19 metabolizes a wide range of 
pharmacologically active substances and a relatively small number of naturally 
occurring environmental toxins. Poor activity alleles of CYP2C19 are very 
frequent worldwide, particularly in Asia, raising the possibility that reduced 
metabolism could be advantageous in some circumstances. The evolutionary 
selective forces acting on this gene have not previously been investigated.We 
analyzed CYP2C19 genetic markers from 127 Gambians and on 120 chromosomes from 
Yoruba, Europeans and Asians (Japanese + Han Chinese) in the Hapmap database. 
Haplotype breakdown was explored using bifurcation plots and relative extended 
haplotype homozygosity (REHH). Allele frequency differentiation across 
populations was estimated using the fixation index (FST) and haplotype diversity 
with coalescent models.
RESULTS: Bifurcation plots suggested conservation of alleles conferring slow 
metabolism (CYP2C19*2 and *3). REHH was high around CYP2C19*2 in Yoruba (REHH 
8.3, at 133.3 kb from the core) and to a lesser extent in Europeans (3.5, at 
37.7 kb) and Asians (2.8, at -29.7 kb). FST at the CYP2C19 locus was low overall 
(0.098). CYP2C19*3 was an FST outlier in Asians (0.293), CYP2C19 haplotype 
diversity < = 0.037, p <0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: We found some evidence that the slow metabolizing allele CYP2C19*2 
is subject to positive selective forces worldwide. Similar evidence was also 
found for CYP2C19*3 which is frequent only in Asia. FST is low at the CYP2C19 
locus, suggesting balancing selection overall. The biological factors 
responsible for these selective pressures are currently unknown. One possible 
explanation is that early humans were exposed to a ubiquitous novel toxin 
activated by CYP2C19. The genetic adaptation took place within the last 
10,000 years which coincides with the development of systematic agricultural 
practices.
