BACKGROUND: Pathologists are often faced with the dilemma of whether to 
recommend continuation of methotrexate therapy for psoriasis within the context 
of an existing pro-fibrogenic risk factor, in this instance, patients with 
genetic hemochromatosis.
CASE PRESENTATIONS: We describe our experience with two male psoriatic patients 
(A and B) on long term methotrexate therapy (cumulative dose A = 1.56 gms and B 
= 7.88 gms) with hetero- (A) and homozygous (B) genetic hemochromatosis. These 
patients liver function were monitored with routine biochemical profiling; apart 
from mild perivenular fibrosis in one patient (B), significant liver fibrosis 
was not identified in either patient with multiple interval percutaneous liver 
biopsies; in the latter instance this patient (B) had an additional risk factor 
of partiality to alcohol.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that methotrexate therapy is relatively safe in patients 
with genetic hemochromatosis, with no other risk factor, but caution that the 
risk of fibrosis be monitored, preferably by non-invasive techniques, or by 
liver biopsy.
