This narrative review discusses the genetics of protection against Helicobacter 
pylori (Hp) infection. After a brief overview of the importance of studying 
infectious disease genes, we provide a detailed account of the properties of Hp, 
with a view to those relevant for our topic. Hp displays a very high level of 
genetic diversity, detectable even between single colonies from the same 
patient. The high genetic diversity of Hp can be evaded by stratifying patients 
according to the infecting Hp strain. This approach enhances the power and 
replication of the study. Scanning for single nucleotide polymorphisms is 
generally not successful since genes rarely work alone. We suggest selecting 
genes to study from among members of the same family, which are therefore 
inclined to cooperate. Further, extending the analysis to the metabolism would 
significantly enhance the power of the study. This combined approach displays 
the protective role of MyD88, TIRAP, and IL1RL1 against Hp infection. Finally, 
several studies in humans have demonstrated that the blood T cell levels are 
under the genetic control of the CD39+ T regulatory cells (TREGS).
