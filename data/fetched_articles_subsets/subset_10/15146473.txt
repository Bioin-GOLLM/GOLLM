Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an 
inherited disorder of homocysteine transsulfuration, which manifests by 
neurological, vascular and connective tissue involvement. So far, 130 pathogenic 
mutations have been recognized in the CBS gene. We examined 10 independent 
alleles in Polish patients suffering from CBS deficiency, and we detected four 
already described mutations (c.1224-2A>C, c.684C>A, c.833T>C, and c.442G>A) and 
two novel mutations (c.429C>G and c.1039+1G>T). The pathogenicity of the novel 
mutations was demonstrated by expression in E.coli. This is the first published 
communication on mutations leading to CBS deficiency in Poland.
