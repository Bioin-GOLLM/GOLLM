OBJECTIVE: Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) has been shown 
to be associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in general 
adult populations. Because men and women with type 2 diabetes are at 
particularly high risk for CHD, the aim of this study was to assess the 
association of Lp-PLA(2) with future coronary events among diabetic men and 
women.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured Lp-PLA(2) activity among 740 men and 
777 women with confirmed diabetes enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-Up 
Study (HPFS) and Nurses' Health Study (NHS). Participants were free of all 
cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline.
RESULTS: During 10 years of follow-up among men and 14 years among women, we 
documented 178 and 146 cases of CHD, respectively. We defined CHD as coronary 
artery bypass graft, angioplasty, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and fatal CHD. 
After adjustment for age, smoking, medical history, and biomarkers including 
C-reactive protein, HDL, and LDL, the relative risk of total CHD comparing 
extreme tertiles of Lp-PLA(2) was 1.39 (95% CI 1.01-1.90; P trend = 0.03). When 
we restricted analyses to only nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD, the 
relative risk was 1.75 (95% CI 1.05-2.92; P for trend = 0.001). LDL, HDL, 
C-reactive protein, hormone replacement therapy use, and diabetes duration did 
not modify these relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of Lp-PLA(2) activity were significantly associated with 
incident CHD among men and women with type 2 diabetes, independent of 
traditional and inflammatory risk factors. This positive association was 
strongest for more severe clinical end points.
