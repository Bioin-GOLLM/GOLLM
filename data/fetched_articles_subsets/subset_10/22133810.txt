Foxp2(R552H) knock-in (KI) mice carrying a mutation related to human 
speech-language disorder exhibit impaired ultrasonic vocalization and poor 
Purkinje cell development. Foxp2 is a forkhead domain-containing transcriptional 
repressor that associates with its co-repressor CtBP; Foxp2(R552H) displays 
reduced DNA binding activity. A genetic connection between FOXP2 and CNTNAP2 has 
been demonstrated in vitro, but not in vivo. Here we show that Cntnap2 mRNA 
levels significantly increased in the cerebellum of Foxp2(R552H) KI pups, 
although the cerebellar population of Foxp2-positive Purkinje cells was very 
small. Furthermore, Cntnap2 immunofluorescence did not decrease in the poorly 
developed Purkinje cells of Foxp2(R552H) KI pups, although synaptophysin 
immunofluorescence decreased. Cntnap2 and CtBP were ubiquitously expressed, 
while Foxp2 co-localized with CtBP only in Purkinje cells. Taken together, these 
observations suggest that Foxp2 may regulate ultrasonic vocalization by 
associating with CtBP in Purkinje cells; Cntnap2 may be a target of this 
co-repressor.
