Many eukaryotic genes contain alternative promoters with distinct expression 
patterns. How these promoters are differentially regulated remains elusive. 
Here, we apply single-molecule imaging to quantify the transcriptional 
regulation of two alternative promoters (P1 and P2) of the Bicoid (Bcd) target 
gene hunchback in syncytial blastoderm Drosophila embryos. Contrary to the 
previous notion that Bcd only activates P2, we find that Bcd activates both 
promoters via the same two enhancers. P1 activation is less frequent and 
requires binding of more Bcd molecules than P2 activation. Using a theoretical 
model to relate promoter activity to enhancer states, we show that the two 
promoters follow common transcription kinetics driven by sequential Bcd binding 
at the two enhancers. Bcd binding at either enhancer primarily activates P2, 
while P1 activation relies more on Bcd binding at both enhancers. These results 
provide a quantitative framework for understanding the kinetic mechanisms of 
complex eukaryotic gene regulation.
