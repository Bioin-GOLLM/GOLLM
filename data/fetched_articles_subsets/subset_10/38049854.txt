BACKGROUND: In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that certain cytokines and 
hormones may play a role in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes 
(T2D). However, studies on their role in T2D in humans are scarce. We evaluated 
associations between 11 circulating cytokines and hormones with T2D among a 
population of sub-Saharan Africans and tested for causal relationships using 
Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses.
METHODS: We used logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass 
index, and recruitment country to regress levels of 11 cytokines and hormones 
(adipsin, leptin, visfatin, PAI-1, GIP, GLP-1, ghrelin, resistin, IL-6, IL-10, 
IL-1RA) on T2D among Ghanaians, Nigerians, and Kenyans from the Africa America 
Diabetes Mellitus study including 2276 individuals with T2D and 2790 non-T2D 
individuals. Similar linear regression models were fitted with homeostatic 
modelling assessments of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) and β-cell function 
(HOMA-B) as dependent variables among non-T2D individuals (n = 2790). We used 35 
genetic variants previously associated with at least one of these 11 cytokines 
and hormones among non-T2D individuals as instrumental variables in univariable 
and multivariable MR analyses. Statistical significance was set at 0.0045 
(0.05/11 cytokines and hormones).
RESULTS: Circulating GIP and IL-1RA levels were associated with T2D. Nine of the 
11 cytokines and hormones (exceptions GLP-1 and IL-6) were associated with 
HOMA-S, HOMA-B, or both among non-T2D individuals. Two-stage least squares MR 
analysis provided evidence for a causal effect of GIP and IL-RA on HOMA-S and 
HOMA-B in multivariable analyses (GIP ~ HOMA-S β =  - 0.67, 
P-value = 1.88 × 10-6 and HOMA-B β = 0.59, P-value = 1.88 × 10-5; IL-1RA ~ 
HOMA-S β =  - 0.51, P-value = 8.49 × 10-5 and HOMA-B 
β = 0.48, P-value = 5.71 × 10-4). IL-RA was partly mediated via BMI (30-34%), 
but GIP was not. Inverse variance weighted MR analysis provided evidence for a 
causal effect of adipsin on T2D (multivariable OR = 1.83, 
P-value = 9.79 × 10-6), though these associations were not consistent in all 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this comprehensive MR analysis indicate that 
circulating GIP and IL-1RA levels are causal for reduced insulin sensitivity and 
increased β-cell function. GIP's effect being independent of BMI suggests that 
circulating levels of GIP could be a promising early biomarker for T2D risk. Our 
MR analyses do not provide conclusive evidence for a causal role of other 
circulating cytokines in T2D among sub-Saharan Africans.
