The orphan receptor CRF2-4 is a member of the class II cytokine receptor family 
(CRF2), which includes the interferon receptors, the interleukin (IL) 10 
receptor, and tissue factor. CRFB4, the gene encoding CRF2-4, is located within 
a gene cluster on human chromosome 21 that comprises three interferon receptor 
subunits. To elucidate the role of CRF2-4, we disrupted the CRFB4 gene in mice 
by means of homologous recombination. Mice lacking CRF2-4 show no overt 
abnormalities, grow normally, and are fertile. CRF2-4 deficient cells are 
normally responsive to type I and type II interferons, but lack responsiveness 
to IL-10. By approximately 12 wk of age, the majority of mutant mice raised in a 
conventional facility developed a chronic colitis and splenomegaly. Thus, CRFB4 
mutant mice recapitulate the phenotype of IL-10-deficient mice. These findings 
suggest that CRF2-4 is essential for IL-10-mediated effects and is a subunit of 
the IL-10 receptor.
