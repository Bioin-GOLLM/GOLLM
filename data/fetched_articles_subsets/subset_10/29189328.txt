Understanding Disease Biology and Informing the Management of Pancreas Cancer 
With Preclinical Model Systems.

Whittle MC, Hingorani SR.

Recent advances in cytotoxic therapies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDA) are overshadowed by stalled clinical progress of more targeted strategies, 
the vast majority of which have failed in clinical trials. Inability to 
translate preclinical promise into clinical efficacy derives, in part, from 
imperfect disease modeling and mismatches between preclinical and clinical study 
design and execution. Into these gaps fall our patients who enter the clinical 
trial landscape expectantly and bear the brunt of its inadequacies. If improving 
patient survival is paramount, then it must be acknowledged that the failure of 
a phase III trial represents a larger failure of all of the work that preceded 
it. Repeated failures suggest a need to reappraise the current 
preclinical-to-clinical apparatus. Exceptional models of PDA are now available 
to researchers, and the first steps toward a new era of success can begin with 
improved selection and application of these systems. We discuss the key features 
of the major preclinical platforms for PDA and propose a paradigm for rigorous 
interrogation of prospective therapies.
