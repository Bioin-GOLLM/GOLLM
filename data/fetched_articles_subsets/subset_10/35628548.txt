Amyloids are protein aggregates with a specific filamentous structure that are 
related to a number of human diseases, and also to some important physiological 
processes in animals and other kingdoms of life. Amyloids in yeast can stably 
propagate as heritable units, prions. Yeast prions are of interest both on their 
own and as a model for amyloids and prions in general. In this review, we 
consider the structure of yeast prions and its variation, how such structures 
determine the balance of aggregated and soluble prion protein through 
interaction with chaperones and how the aggregated state affects the non-prion 
functions of these proteins.
