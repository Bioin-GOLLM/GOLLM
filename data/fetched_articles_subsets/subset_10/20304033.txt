BACKGROUND: Serum ferritin was discovered in the 1930s, and was developed as a 
clinical test in the 1970s. Many diseases are associated with iron overload or 
iron deficiency. Serum ferritin is widely used in diagnosing and monitoring 
these diseases.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this chapter, we discuss the role of serum ferritin in 
physiological and pathological processes and its use as a clinical tool.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Although many aspects of the fundamental biology of serum 
ferritin remain surprisingly unclear, a growing number of roles have been 
attributed to extracellular ferritin, including newly described roles in iron 
delivery, angiogenesis, inflammation, immunity, signaling and cancer.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Serum ferritin remains a clinically useful tool. Further 
studies on the biology of this protein may provide new biological insights.
