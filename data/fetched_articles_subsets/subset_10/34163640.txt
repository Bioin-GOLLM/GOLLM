By introducing 1,1'-bis-(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) as an activating 
ligand, two novel nanoclusters, M1Ag21 (M = Au/Ag), have been controllably 
synthesized and structurally characterized. The atomically precise structures of 
the M1Ag21 nanoclusters were determined by SCXC and further confirmed by 
ESI-TOF-MS, TGA, XPS, DPV, and FT-IR measurements. The M1Ag21 nanoclusters 
supported on activated carbon (C) are exploited as efficient oxygen reduction 
reaction (ORR) catalysts in alkaline solutions. Density functional theory (DFT) 
calculations verify that the catalytic activities of the two cluster-based 
systems originate from the significant ensemble synergy effect between the M13 
kernel and dppf ligand in M1Ag21. This work sheds lights on the preparation of 
cluster-based electrocatalysts and other catalysts that are activated and 
modified by peripheral ligands.
