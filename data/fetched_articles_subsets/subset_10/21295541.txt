Several cardiomyopathy causing mutations on tropomyosin either destabilize the 
active state of actomyosin or alter the binding properties of tropomyosin.

We examined the cardiomyopathy-causing tropomyosin mutations E180G, D175N, and 
V95A to determine their effects on actomyosin regulation. V95A reduced the 
ATPase rate when filaments were saturated with regulatory proteins both in the 
presence and absence of calcium, indicating either a stabilization of the 
inactive state or an inability to fully populate the active state. Effects of 
E180G and D175N were more complex. These two mutations increased ATPase rates at 
sub-saturating concentrations of troponin and tropomyosin as compared to wild 
type tropomyosin. At higher concentrations of regulatory proteins, ATPase rates 
became similar to wild type. Normal activation was achieved with the 
tight-binding myosin analog N-ethylmaleimide-S1, at saturating regulatory 
protein concentrations. These results suggest that the E180G and D175N mutations 
reduce the affinity of tropomyosin for actin and also destabilize troponin 
binding to the actin thin filaments.
