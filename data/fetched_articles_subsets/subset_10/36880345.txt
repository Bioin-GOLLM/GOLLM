The GsGd lineage (A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996) H5N1 virus was introduced to Canada 
in 2021/2022 through the Atlantic and East Asia-Australasia/Pacific flyways by 
migratory birds. This was followed by unprecedented outbreaks affecting domestic 
and wild birds, with spillover into other animals. Here, we report sporadic 
cases of H5N1 in 40 free-living mesocarnivore species such as red foxes, striped 
skunks, and mink in Canada. The clinical presentations of the disease in 
mesocarnivores were consistent with central nervous system infection. This was 
supported by the presence of microscopic lesions and the presence of abundant 
IAV antigen by immunohistochemistry. Some red foxes that survived clinical 
infection developed anti-H5N1 antibodies. Phylogenetically, the H5N1 viruses 
from the mesocarnivore species belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b and had four different 
genome constellation patterns. The first group of viruses had wholly Eurasian 
(EA) genome segments. The other three groups were reassortant viruses containing 
genome segments derived from both North American (NAm) and EA influenza A 
viruses. Almost 17 percent of the H5N1 viruses had mammalian adaptive mutations 
(E627 K, E627V and D701N) in the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) subunit of the 
RNA polymerase complex. Other mutations that may favour adaptation to mammalian 
hosts were also present in other internal gene segments. The detection of these 
critical mutations in a large number of mammals within short duration after 
virus introduction inevitably highlights the need for continually monitoring and 
assessing mammalian-origin H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses for adaptive mutations, 
which potentially can facilitate virus replication, horizontal transmission and 
posing pandemic risks for humans.
