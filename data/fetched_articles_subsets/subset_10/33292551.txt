In recent years, there have been advancements in traditional patterns of tumor 
therapy with the adoption of immunotherapy. Its application with or without 
other combined regimens has attracted attention from clinicians. Sintilimab 
(TyvytÂ®), a highly selective fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody, blocks the 
binding site of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), thereby, inhibiting the 
interaction between PD-1 and its ligands (PD-L1/2) to restore the endogenous 
anti-tumor T cell responses. Sintilimab has been proven to be clinically 
beneficial in multiple solid tumor therapies. Combination therapy and 
monotherapy have shown potential and encouraging anti-tumor efficacy with 
controllable and acceptable toxicities. The combination therapy is more likely 
to be a novel and promising therapeutic option. This study provides an overview 
of the status of sintilimab-based clinical trials in various solid tumors.
