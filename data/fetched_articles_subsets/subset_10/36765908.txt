This study aimed to investigate the potential of quantitative radiomic data 
extracted from conventional MR images in discriminating IDH-mutant grade 4 
astrocytomas from IDH-wild-type glioblastomas (GBMs). A cohort of 57 
treatment-naïve patients with IDH-mutant grade 4 astrocytomas (n = 23) and 
IDH-wild-type GBMs (n = 34) underwent anatomical imaging on a 3T MR system with 
standard parameters. Post-contrast T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images were 
co-registered. A semi-automatic segmentation approach was used to generate 
regions of interest (ROIs) from different tissue components of neoplasms. A 
total of 1050 radiomic features were extracted from each image. The data were 
split randomly into training and testing sets. A deep learning-based data 
augmentation method (CTGAN) was implemented to synthesize 200 datasets from the 
training sets. A total of 18 classifiers were used to distinguish two genotypes 
of grade 4 astrocytomas. From generated data using 80% training set, the best 
discriminatory power was obtained from core tumor regions overlaid on 
post-contrast T1 using the K-best feature selection algorithm and a Gaussian 
naïve Bayes classifier (AUC = 0.93, accuracy = 0.92, sensitivity = 1, 
specificity = 0.86, PR_AUC = 0.92). Similarly, high diagnostic performances were 
obtained from original and generated data using 50% and 30% training sets. Our 
findings suggest that conventional MR imaging-based radiomic features combined 
with machine/deep learning methods may be valuable in discriminating IDH-mutant 
grade 4 astrocytomas from IDH-wild-type GBMs.
