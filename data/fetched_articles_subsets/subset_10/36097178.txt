BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a paediatric cancer driven either by 
fusion proteins (e.g., PAX3-FOXO1) or by mutations in key signalling molecules 
(e.g., RAS or FGFR4). Despite the latter providing opportunities for precision 
medicine approaches in RMS, there are currently no such treatments implemented 
in the clinic.
METHODS: We evaluated biologic properties and targeting strategies for the FGFR4 
V550L activating mutation in RMS559 cells, which have a high allelic fraction of 
this mutation and are oncogenically dependent on FGFR4 signalling. Signalling 
and trafficking of FGFR4 V550L were characterised by confocal microscopy and 
proteomics. Drug effects were determined by live-cell imaging, MTS assay, and in 
a mouse model.
RESULTS: Among recently developed FGFR4-specific inhibitors, FGF401 inhibited 
FGFR4 V550L-dependent signalling and cell proliferation at low nanomolar 
concentrations. Two other FGFR4 inhibitors, BLU9931 and H3B6527, lacked potent 
activity against FGFR4 V550L. Alternate targeting strategies were identified by 
RMS559 phosphoproteomic analyses, demonstrating that RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT are 
essential druggable pathways downstream of FGFR4 V550L. Furthermore, we found 
that FGFR4 V550L is HSP90-dependent, and HSP90 inhibitors efficiently impeded 
RMS559 proliferation. In a RMS559 mouse xenograft model, the pan-FGFR inhibitor, 
LY2874455, did not efficiently inhibit growth, whereas FGF401 potently abrogated 
growth.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results pave the way for precision medicine approaches against 
FGFR4 V550L-driven RMS.
