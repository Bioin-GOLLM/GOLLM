Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines 
demonstrate reduced protection against acquisition of BA.5 subvariant but are 
still effective against severe disease. However, immune correlates of protection 
against BA.5 remain unknown. We report the immunogenicity and protective 
efficacy of vaccine regimens consisting of the vector-based Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 
and the adjuvanted spike ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine against a 
high-dose, mismatched Omicron BA.5 challenge in macaques. The SpFNx3 and Ad26 + 
SpFNx2 regimens elicit higher antibody responses than Ad26x3, whereas the Ad26 + 
SpFNx2 and Ad26x3 regimens induce higher CD8 T cell responses than SpFNx3. The 
Ad26 + SpFNx2 regimen elicits the highest CD4 T cell responses. All three 
regimens suppress peak and day 4 viral loads in the respiratory tract, which 
correlate with both humoral and cellular immune responses. This study 
demonstrates that both homologous and heterologous regimens involving 
Ad26.COV2.S and SpFN vaccines provide robust protection against a mismatched 
BA.5 challenge in macaques.
