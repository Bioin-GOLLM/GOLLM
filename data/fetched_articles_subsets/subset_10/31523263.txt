BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common cause of end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD). The benefits and effects of renin-angiotensin system blocker 
drugs are obvious in decreasing albuminuria, but there is a need to find other 
drugs that can decrease albuminuria. The aim of our study is to evaluate the 
effect of short-term administration of curcumin on overt albuminuria in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed 
on 46 patients with T2DM, overt albuminuria ≥300 mg/24 h, and estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2. After the random 
allocation of the patients, they were divided into two groups. In the curcumin 
group, the patients received 500 mg (one capsule) of curcumin with each meal 
(three times/day after meal) for 16 weeks. Other variables including blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), fasting blood sugar (FBS), 2-h postprandial 
blood sugar (2-h pp BS), lipid profile, 24-h urine analysis for albuminuria, 
serum albumin, and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) were checked at baseline and bimonthly 
too.
RESULTS: two groups at baseline were comparable in terms of basic 
characteristics (P > 0.05). Albuminuria decreased significantly from 900.42 ± 
621.91 at the baseline to 539.68 ± 375.16 at the end of the study in the 
curcumin group (P Time = 0.002); however, no statistically significant changes 
were observed in the placebo group (519.94 ± 214.33 at the baseline vs. 444.00 ± 
219.10 at the end of the trial; P Time = 0.43), and the decrease was 
significantly higher in the curcumin group than that of the placebo group (P 
Intervention = 0.01). No significant differences were observed between the 
placebo and curcumin in terms of changes in serum BUN, Cr, FBS, 2-h pp BS, 
HbA1C, lipid profile, and albumin.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that curcumin as an active turmeric metabolite was 
an effective adjuvant therapy for ameliorating macroscopic proteinuria in type 2 
diabetic patients. Its effect may appear after 2 months of therapy and even in 
patients with a mild decrease in GFR. Further studies with larger sample size 
and longer duration are recommended.
