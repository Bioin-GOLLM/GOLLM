RATIONALE: Microbubbles conjugated with targeting ligands are used as contrast 
agents for ultrasound molecular imaging. However, they often contain immunogenic 
(strept)avidin, which impedes application in humans. Although targeting bubbles 
not employing the biotin-(strept)avidin conjugation chemistry have been 
explored, only a few reached the stage of ultrasound imaging in vivo, none were 
reported/evaluated to show all three of the following properties desired for 
clinical applications: (i) low degree of non-specific bubble retention in more 
than one non-reticuloendothelial tissue; (ii) effective for real-time imaging; 
and (iii) effective for acoustic quantification of molecular targets to a high 
degree of quantification. Furthermore, disclosures of the compositions and 
methodologies enabling reproduction of the bubbles are often withheld.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a targeting microbubble based on 
maleimide-thiol conjugation chemistry for ultrasound molecular imaging.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbubbles with a previously unreported generic 
(non-targeting components) composition were grafted with anti-E-selectin F(ab')2 
using maleimide-thiol conjugation, to produce E-selectin targeting microbubbles. 
The resulting targeting bubbles showed high specificity to E-selectin in vitro 
and in vivo. Non-specific bubble retention was minimal in at least three 
non-reticuloendothelial tissues with inflammation (mouse heart, kidneys, 
cremaster). The bubbles were effective for real-time ultrasound imaging of 
E-selectin expression in the inflamed mouse heart and kidneys, using a clinical 
ultrasound scanner. The acoustic signal intensity of the targeted bubbles 
retained in the heart correlated strongly with the level of E-selectin 
expression (|r|â‰¥0.8), demonstrating a high degree of non-invasive molecular 
quantification.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeting microbubbles for ultrasound molecular imaging, based on 
maleimide-thiol conjugation chemistry and the generic composition described, may 
possess properties (i)-(iii) desired for clinical applications.
