N-methylated amino acids are found in Nature in various biological compounds. 
N-methylation of amino acids has been shown to improve pharmacokinetic 
properties of peptide drugs due to conformational changes, improved proteolytic 
stability and/or higher lipophilicity. Due to these characteristics N-methylated 
amino acids received increasing interest by the pharmaceutical industry. 
Syntheses of N-methylated amino acids by chemical and biocatalytic approaches 
are known, but often show incomplete stereoselectivity, low yields or expensive 
co-factor regeneration. So far a one-step fermentative process from sugars has 
not yet been described. Here, a one-step conversion of sugars and methylamine to 
the N-methylated amino acid N-methyl-L-alanine was developed. A whole-cell 
biocatalyst was derived from a pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain by 
heterologous expression of the N-methyl-L-amino acid dehydrogenase gene from 
Pseudomonas putida. As proof-of-concept, N-methyl-L-alanine titers of 31.7 g L-1 
with a yield of 0.71 g per g glucose were achieved in fed-batch cultivation. The 
C. glutamicum strain producing this imine reductase enzyme was engineered 
further to extend this green chemistry route to production of N-methyl-L-alanine 
from alternative feed stocks such as starch or the lignocellulosic sugars xylose 
and arabinose.
