BACKGROUND: Imatinib mesylate has been used for the treatment of unresectable or 
metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The current recommended dose 
of imatinib is 400 mg/day that is increased to 800 mg/day in cases with disease 
progression. However, imatinib can be associated with diverse adverse events, 
which has limited its use. We report a case of severe adverse skin reactions 
with neutropenic fever during imatinib treatment in a patient with GIST.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old man was admitted with a one month history of 
epigastric pain and a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant. An abdominal CT 
scan revealed a 20 x 19 cm intraabdominal mass with tumor invasion into the 
peritoneum. Needle biopsy was performed and the results showed spindle shaped 
tumor cells that were positive for c-KIT. The patient was diagnosed with 
unresectable GIST. Imatinib 400 mg/day was started. The patient tolerated the 
first eight weeks of treatment. However, about three months later, the patient 
developed a grade 4 febrile neutropenia and a grade 3 exfoliative skin rash. The 
patient recovered from this serious adverse events after discontinuation of 
imatinib with supportive care. However, the skin lesions recurred whenever the 
patient received imatinib over 100 mg/day. Therefore, imatinib 100 mg/day was 
maintained. Despite the low dose imatinib, follow up CT showed a marked partial 
response without grade 3 or 4 toxicities.
CONCLUSION: The recommended dose of imatinib for the treatment of GIST is 400 
mg/day but patients at risk for adverse drug reaction may benefit from lower 
doses. Individualized treatment is needed for such patients, and we may also try 
sunitinib as a alternative drug.
