Members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family are potential therapeutic targets. 
Abnormal signaling by mutant JAK2 is related to hematological malignancy, such 
as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI)-resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We discovered a potent 
and highly selective inhibitor of JAK2 over JAK1 and -3 based on the structure 
of 4-(2,5-triazole)-pyrrolopyrimidine. Among all triazole compounds tested, 
2,5-triazole regioisomers more effectively inhibited JAK2 kinase activity than 
isomers with substitutions of various alkyl groups at the R2 position, except 
for methyl-substituted 1,5-triazole, which was more potent than the 
corresponding 1,4- and 2,5-triazoles. None of the synthesized 1,4-isomers 
inhibited all three JAK family members. Compounds with phenyl or tolyl group 
substituents at the R1 position were completely inactive compared with the 
corresponding analogues with a methyl substituted at the R1 position. As a 
result of this structure-activity relationship, 54, which is substituted with a 
cyclopropylmethyl moiety, exhibited significant inhibitory activity and 
selectivity (IC50=41.9nM, fold selectivity JAK1/2 10.6 and JAK3/2 58.1). 
Compound 54 also exhibited an equivalent inhibition of wild type JAK2 and the 
V617F mutant. Moreover, 54 inhibited the proliferation of HEL 92.1.7 cells, 
which carry JAK2 V617F, and gefitinib-resistant HCC827 cells. Compound 54 also 
suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation at Y705.
