Cancer-testicular Antigens (CTAs) belong to a group of proteins that under 
normal conditions are strictly expressed in a male's reproductive tissues. 
However, upon malignisation, they are frequently re-expressed in neoplastic 
tissues of various origin. A number of studies have shown that different CTAs 
affect growth, migration and invasion of tumor cells and favor cancer 
development and metastasis. Two members of the CTA group, Semenogelin 1 and 2 
(SEMG1 and SEMG2, or SEMGs) represent the major component of human seminal 
fluid. They regulate the motility and capacitation of sperm. They are often 
re-expressed in different malignancies including breast cancer. However, there 
is almost no information about the functional properties of SEMGs in cancer 
cells. In this review, we highlight the role of SEMGs in the reproductive system 
and also summarize the data on their expression and functions in malignant cells 
of various origins.
