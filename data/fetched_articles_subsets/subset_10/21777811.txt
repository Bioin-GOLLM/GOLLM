The ClpS adaptor delivers N-end rule substrates to ClpAP, an energy-dependent 
AAA+ protease, for degradation. How ClpS binds specific N-end residues is known 
in atomic detail and clarified here, but the delivery mechanism is poorly 
understood. We show that substrate binding is enhanced when ClpS binds hexameric 
ClpA. Reciprocally, N-end rule substrates increase ClpS affinity for ClpA(6). 
Enhanced binding requires the N-end residue and a peptide bond of the substrate, 
as well as multiple aspects of ClpS, including a side chain that contacts the 
substrate α-amino group and the flexible N-terminal extension (NTE). Finally, 
enhancement also needs the N domain and AAA+ rings of ClpA, connected by a long 
linker. The NTE can be engaged by the ClpA translocation pore, but ClpS resists 
unfolding/degradation. We propose a staged-delivery model that illustrates how 
intimate contacts between the substrate, adaptor, and protease reprogram 
specificity and coordinate handoff from the adaptor to the protease.
