Little is known about how obesity susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) interact with moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in relation 
to BMI during adolescence, once obesogenic neighborhood factors are accounted 
for. In race stratified models, including European (EA; N=4977), African (AA; 
N=1726), and Hispanic Americans (HA; N=1270) from the National Longitudinal 
Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1996; ages 12-21), we assessed the evidence 
for a SNPxMVPA interaction with BMI-for-age Z score, once accounting for 
obesogenic neighborhood factors including physical activity amenities, 
transportation and recreation infrastructure, poverty and crime. Eight SNPxMVPA 
interactions with suggestive significance (p<0.10; three in each EA, and AA, two 
in HA) were observed showing attenuation on BMI-for-age Z score in adolescents 
with ≥5 versus <5 bouts/week MVPA, except for rs10146997 (near NRXN3). Findings 
were robust to the inclusion of neighborhood-level variables as covariates. 
These findings suggest that any attenuation from MVPA on a genetic 
susceptibility to obesity during adolescence is likely not operating through 
obesogenic neighborhood factors.
