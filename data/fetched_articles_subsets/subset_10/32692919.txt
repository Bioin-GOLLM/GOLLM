Alkyl-ligated iron-sulfur clusters in the [Fe4S4]3+ charge state have been 
proposed as short-lived intermediates in a number of enzymatic reactions. To 
better understand the properties of these intermediates, we have prepared and 
characterized the first synthetic [Fe4S4]3+-alkyl cluster. Isolation of this 
highly reactive species was made possible by the development of an expanded 
scorpionate ligand suited to the encapsulation of cuboidal clusters. Like the 
proposed enzymatic intermediates, this synthetic [Fe4S4]3+-alkyl cluster adopts 
an S = 1/2 ground state with giso > 2. Mössbauer spectroscopic studies reveal 
that the alkylated Fe has an unusually low isomer shift, which reflects the 
highly covalent Fe-C bond and the localization of Fe3+ at the alkylated site in 
the solid state. Paramagnetic 1H NMR studies establish that this valence 
localization persists in solution at physiologically relevant temperatures, an 
effect that has not been observed for [Fe4S4]3+ clusters outside of a protein. 
These findings establish the unusual electronic-structure effects imparted by 
the strong-field alkyl ligand and lay the foundation for understanding the 
electronic structures of [Fe4S4]3+-alkyl intermediates in biology.
