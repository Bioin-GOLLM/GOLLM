Opiate alkaloids and their synthetic derivatives are still widely used in pain 
management, drug addiction, and abuse. To avoid serious side effects, compounds 
with properly designed pharmacological profiles at the opioid receptor subtypes 
are long needed. Here a series of 17-N-substituted derivatives of normorphine 
and noroxymorphone analogues with five- and six-membered ring substituents have 
been synthesized for structure-activity study. Some compounds showed nanomolar 
affinity to MOR, DOR and KOR in in vitro competition binding experiments with 
selective agonists [3H]DAMGO, [3H]Ile5,6-deltorphin II and [3H]HS665, 
respectively. Pharmacological characterization of the compounds in G-protein 
signaling was determined by [35S]GTPγS binding assays. The normorphine analogues 
showed higher affinity to KOR compared to MOR and DOR, while most of the 
noroxymorphone derivatives did not bind to KOR. The presence of 14-OH 
substituent resulted in a shift in the pharmacological profiles in the 
agonist > partial agonist > antagonist direction compared to the parent 
compounds. A molecular docking-based in silico method was also applied to 
estimate the pharmacological profile of the compounds. Docking energies and the 
patterns of the interacting receptor atoms, obtained with experimentally 
determined active and inactive states of MOR, were used to explain the observed 
pharmacological features of the compounds.
