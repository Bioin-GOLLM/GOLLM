BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib combined with pembrolizumab showed a promising result in 
an early phase study for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The efficacy and safety 
of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab for patients with unresectable HCC (uHCC) 
beyond the first-line setting were unclear.
METHODS: Seventy-one consecutive patients who received lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab for uHCC were prospectively enrolled. Effect of lenvatinib 
combinations on Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score and factors associated with 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 71 cases, 58 (81.7%) were in BCLC C. There were 44 (62%) for the 
first-line systemic treatment, and 27 (38%) had experienced targeted therapy or 
nivolumab treatment. The objective response rate and disease control rate (DCR) 
were 34.1% and 84.1% for the first-line setting, and 18.5% and 70.4% for 
systemic therapy-experienced cases (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
version 1.1, RECIST v1.1), respectively. The mean ALBI score was stable during 
the treatment course. After a median of 9.3 months of follow-up, the median PFS 
was 9.3 months versus 4.4 months, and the median OS was not estimable yet versus 
12 months for Child-Pugh A versus B patients, respectively. Prior nivolumab 
failure was the only significant factor associated with poorer PFS (HR = 3.253, 
p = 0.004). Child-Pugh class B (HR = 2.646, p = 0.039) and prior nivolumab 
failure (HR = 3.340, p = 0.014) were independent factors for poorer OS in 
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: A high DCR was observed by lenvatinib/pembrolizumab combination 
without adverse effect on ALBI score for systemic therapy-naïve and -experienced 
uHCC. Suboptimal response to prior nivolumab-failed patients requires further 
exploration.
