Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited cardiovascular disease 
and is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricle. We reprogrammed 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a HCM patient into pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSC) (YCMi006-A) carrying a heterozygous c.1029C > G mutation in 
ACTA1. The YCMi006-A cells expressed high levels of pluripotent markers, had a 
normal 46XX karyotype and demonstrated the capacity to differentiate into 
derivatives of all three germ layers. This cell line can be a valuable tool for 
investigating the pathogenesis of HCM.
