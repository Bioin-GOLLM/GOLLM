Tyrosinase-related oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1), an autosomal recessive inborn 
error of pigmentation, is caused by the deficiency of tyrosinase. We had 
previously identified two different mutations of the TYR gene in a four year old 
Korean male with mild OCA; a P310insC frameshift in exon 2 and an 
IVS2-7t-->a,-10-11deltt splice junction mutation in exon 3. Here we report a 
prenatal diagnostic study of a subsequent fetus of the above family that was at 
25% risk of OCA1. SSCP/heteroduplex screening, restriction enzyme digestion, and 
allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization analyses of DNA obtained by 
chorionic villus sampling indicated that the fetus was a compound heterozygote 
for the paternal P310insC and the maternal IVS2-7t-->a,-10-11deltt mutations. 
The diagnosis was later confirmed by observation of poorly pigmented irides of 
the abortus terminated at the 18th week of gestation. This approach provides a 
fast and reliable method for DNA-based prenatal diagnosis when specific 
mutations are known in families at high risk of OCA1.
