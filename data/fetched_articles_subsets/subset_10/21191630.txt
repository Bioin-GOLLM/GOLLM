Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFR) are central 
components in the development and progression of glioblastoma. To investigate if 
genetic variation in VEGF and VEGFR2 is associated with glioblastoma prognosis, 
we examined blood samples from 154 glioblastoma cases collected in Sweden and 
Denmark between 2000 and 2004. Seventeen tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in VEGF and 27 in VEGFR2 were genotyped and analysed, covering 90% of the 
genetic variability within the genes. In VEGF, we found no SNPs associated with 
survival. In VEGFR2, we found two SNPs significantly associated to survival, 
namely rs2071559 and rs12502008. However, these results are likely to be false 
positives due to multiple testing and could not be confirmed in a separate 
dataset. Overall, this study provides little evidence that VEGF and VEGFR2 
polymorphisms are important for glioblastoma survival.
