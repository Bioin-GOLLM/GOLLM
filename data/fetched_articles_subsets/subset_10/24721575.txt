During primary infection, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) spreads systemically, 
resulting in virus replication and pathology in multiple organs. This 
disseminated infection is ultimately controlled, but the underlying immune 
defense mechanisms are unclear. Investigating the role of the cytokine IL-22 in 
MCMV infection, we discovered an unanticipated function for neutrophils as 
potent antiviral effector cells that restrict viral replication and associated 
pathogenesis in peripheral organs. NK-, NKT-, and T cell-secreted IL-22 
orchestrated antiviral neutrophil-mediated responses via induction in stromal 
nonhematopoietic tissue of the neutrophil-recruiting chemokine CXCL1. The 
antiviral effector properties of infiltrating neutrophils were directly linked 
to the expression of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Our data 
identify a role for neutrophils in antiviral defense, and establish a functional 
link between IL-22 and the control of antiviral neutrophil responses that 
prevents pathogenic herpesvirus infection in peripheral organs.
