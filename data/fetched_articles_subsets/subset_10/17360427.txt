Nuclear NAD(+) metabolism constitutes a major component of signaling pathways. 
It includes NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylation by members of the Sir2 family 
and protein modification by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1). PARP-1 has 
emerged as an important mediator of processes involving DNA rearrangements. 
High-affinity binding to breaks in DNA activates PARP-1, which attaches 
poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) to target proteins. NMN adenylyl transferases (NMNATs) 
catalyze the final step of NAD(+) biosynthesis. We report here that the nuclear 
isoform NMNAT-1 stimulates PARP-1 activity and binds to PAR. Its overexpression 
in HeLa cells promotes the relocation of apoptosis-inducing factor from the 
mitochondria to the nucleus, a process known to depend on 
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Moreover, NMNAT-1 is subject to phosphorylation by 
protein kinase C, resulting in reduced binding to PAR. Mimicking 
phosphorylation, substitution of the target serine residue by aspartate 
precludes PAR binding and stimulation of PARP-1. We conclude that, depending on 
its state of phosphorylation, NMNAT-1 binds to activated, automodifying PARP-1 
and thereby amplifies poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.
