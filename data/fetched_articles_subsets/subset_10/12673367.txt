The structure of the EDA1 gene was investigated in a patient with anhidrotic 
ectodermal dysplasia. Sequence analysis revealed a novel A1270G transition in 
exon 9 of the EDA1 gene in the patient and his uncle, whereas the patient's 
mother and grandmother were heterozygotes. This mutation resulted in Tyr343Cys 
substitution in the extracellular domain of the EDA1 gene product - 
ectodysplasin-A. The additional Cys343 was located between Cys332 and Cys346 and 
formed with Cys352 a cluster of four closely situated residues that could 
potentially form disulfide bonds. This mutation might affect the tertiary 
structure of the receptor-binding domain of ectodysplasin-A and precipitate the 
clinical symptoms of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.
