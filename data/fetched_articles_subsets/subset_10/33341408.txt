BACKGROUND: Minigenes and in silico prediction tools are commonly used to assess 
the impact on splicing of CFTR variants. Exon skipping is often neglected though 
it could impact the efficacy of targeted therapies. The aim of the study was to 
identify exon skipping associated with CFTR variants and to evaluate in silico 
predictions of seven freely available software.
METHODS: CFTR basal exon skipping was evaluated on endogenous mRNA extracted 
from non-CF nasal cells and on two CFTR minigene banks. In silico tools and 
minigene systems were used to evaluate the impact of CFTR exonic variants on 
exon skipping.
RESULTS: Data showed that out of 65 CFTR variants tested, 26 enhanced exon 
skipping and that in silico prediction efficacy was of 50%-66%. Some in silico 
tools presented predictions with a bias towards the occurrence of splicing 
events while others presented a bias towards the absence of splicing events 
(non-detection including true negatives and false negatives). Classification of 
exons depending on their basal exon skipping level increased prediction rates up 
to 80%.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that taking basal exon skipping into account 
could orientate the choice of the in silico tools to improve prediction rates. 
It also highlights the need to validate effects using in vitro assays or mRNA 
studies in patients. Eventually, it shows that variant-guided therapy should 
also target exon skipping associated with variants.
