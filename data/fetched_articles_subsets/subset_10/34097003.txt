Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is the most damaging pandemic in recent human 
history. Rapid detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) and variant strains is paramount for recovery from this pandemic. 
Conventional SARS-CoV-2 tests interrogate only limited regions of the whole 
SARS-CoV-2 genome, which are subjected to low specificity and miss the 
opportunity of detecting variant strains. In this work, we developed the first 
SARS-CoV-2 tiling array that captures the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome at single 
nucleotide resolution and offers the opportunity to detect point mutations. A 
thorough bioinformatics protocol of two base calling methods has been developed 
to accompany this array. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the tiling array, 
we genotyped all genomic positions of eight SARS-CoV-2 samples. Using 
high-throughput sequencing as the benchmark, we show that the tiling array had a 
genome-wide accuracy of at least 99.5%. From the tiling array analysis results, 
we identified the D614G mutation in the spike protein in four of the eight 
samples, suggesting the widespread distribution of this variant at the early 
stage of the outbreak in the United States. Two additional nonsynonymous 
mutations were identified in one sample in the nucleocapsid protein (P13L and 
S197L), which may complicate future vaccine development. With around $5 per 
array, supreme accuracy, and an ultrafast bioinformatics protocol, the 
SARS-CoV-2 tiling array makes an invaluable toolkit for combating current and 
future pandemics. Our SARS-CoV-2 tilting array is currently utilized by 
Molecular Vision, a CLIA-certified lab for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.
