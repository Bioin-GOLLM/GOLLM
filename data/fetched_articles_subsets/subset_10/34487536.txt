OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic etiology of a fetus with autosomal recessive 
polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD).
METHODS: Prenatal ultrasonography has revealed oligohydramnios and abnormal 
structure of fetal kidneys. After careful counseling, the couple opted induced 
abortion. With informed consent, genomic DNA was extracted from the muscle 
sample of the abortus and peripheral blood samples of the couple. High 
throughput whole exome sequencing was carried out to detect potential variants 
in relation with the disease. Suspected variants were verified by Sanger 
sequencing.
RESULTS: Prenatal ultrasound revealed increased size of fetal kidneys, with 
multiple hyperechos from the right kidney, and multiple hyperechos with anechoic 
masses within the left kidney. DNA sequencing revealed that the fetus has 
carried heterozygous variants of the PKHD1 gene, including c.7994T>C inherited 
from its father, and two heterozygous variants of the PKHD1 gene c.5681G>A from 
its mother.
CONCLUSION: The compound heterozygous c.7994T>C and c.5681G>A variants of the 
PKHD1 gene probably underlay the pathogenesis of ARPKD in this fetus. Above 
results can provide guidance for subsequent pregnancies of the couple.
