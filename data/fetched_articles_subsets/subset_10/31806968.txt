OBJECTIVE: Nintedanib (NDNB) is a triple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with 
poor solubility in neutral conditions and low bioavailability. A 
self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) of NDNB was developed to 
improve drug solubility in physical conditions and absorption in vivo.
METHODS: The NDNB-SMEDDS formulation was optimized via pseudo-ternary phase 
diagrams. The physicochemical properties of NDNB-SMEDDS, viz., morphological 
observation, droplet size, stability, compatibility and in vitro release were 
investigated. The permeability of NDNB-SMEDDS was detected using both a Caco-2 
cell monolayer in vitro and an intestinal perfusion study in vivo. Furthermore, 
the pharmacokinetic characteristics of NDNB-SMEDDS were evaluated.
RESULTS: The optimal formulation was composed of MCT as an oil phase, RH 40 as a 
surfactant and ethylene glycol as a co-surfactant. The average droplet size of 
the microemulsion was about 23 nm with good stability within 30 days. The 
formulation did not exhibit any obvious cytotoxic effect on Caco-2 cells. 
Permeability of nintedanib in a Caco-2 cell monolayer was enhanced by 2.8-fold 
upon incorporation in SMEDDS compared with the drug solution. The intestinal 
perfusion study demonstrated that the P app of NDNB-SMEDDS increased by 3.0-fold 
in the entire intestine and 3.2-fold in the colon in comparison with the drug 
solution. The pharmacokinetics study showed that the AUC of the NDNB-SMEDDS 
increased significantly.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that the self-microemulsion formulations could 
improve the absorption of nintedanib, and can thus serve as a promising carrier 
for the oral delivery of nintedanib.
