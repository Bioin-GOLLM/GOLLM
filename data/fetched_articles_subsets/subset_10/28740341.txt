AIM: To evaluate the protective effects of glutamine in a model of portal 
hypertension (PH) induced by partial portal vein ligation (PPVL).
METHODS: Male Wistar rats were housed in a controlled environment and were 
allowed access to food and water ad libitum. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were 
divided into four experimental groups: (1) control group (SO) - rats underwent 
exploratory laparotomy; (2) control + glutamine group (SO + G) - rats were 
subjected to laparotomy and were treated intraperitoneally with glutamine; (3) 
portal hypertension group (PPVL) - rats were subjected to PPVL; and (4) PPVL + 
glutamine group (PPVL + G) - rats were treated intraperitoneally with glutamine 
for seven days. Local injuries were determined by evaluating intestinal segments 
for oxidative stress using lipid peroxidation and the activities of glutathione 
peroxidase (GPx), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS) after PPVL.
RESULTS: Lipid peroxidation of the membrane was increased in the animals 
subjected to PH (P < 0.01). However, the group that received glutamine for seven 
days after the PPVL procedure showed levels of lipid peroxidation similar to 
those of the control groups (P > 0.05). The activity of the antioxidant enzyme 
GTx was decreased in the gut of animals subjected to PH compared with that in 
the control group of animals not subjected to PH (P < 0.01). However, the group 
that received glutamine for seven days after the PPVL showed similar GTx 
activity to both the control groups not subjected to PH (P > 0.05). At least 10 
random, non-overlapping images of each histological slide with 200 × 
magnification (44 pixel = 1 μm) were captured. The sum means of all areas, of 
each group were calculated. The mean areas of eNOS staining for both of the 
control groups were similar. The PPVL group showed the largest area of staining 
for eNOS. The PPVL + G group had the second highest amount of staining, but the 
mean value was much lower than that of the PPVL group (P < 0.01). For iNOS, the 
control (SO) and control + G (SO + G) groups showed similar areas of staining. 
The PPVL group contained the largest area of iNOS staining, followed by the PPVL 
+ G group; however, this area was significantly smaller than that of the group 
that underwent PH without glutamine (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Treatment with glutamine prevents gut mucosal injury after PH in 
rats.
