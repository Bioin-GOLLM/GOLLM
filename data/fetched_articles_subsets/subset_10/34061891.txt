Adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome replication only occurs in the presence of a 
co-infecting helper virus such as adenovirus type 5 (AdV5) or herpes simplex 
virus type 1 (HSV-1). AdV5-supported replication of the AAV genome has been 
described to occur in a strand-displacement rolling hairpin replication (RHR) 
mechanism initiated at the AAV 3' inverted terminal repeat (ITR) end. It has 
been assumed that the same mechanism applies to HSV-1-supported AAV genome 
replication. Using Southern analysis and nanopore sequencing as a novel, 
high-throughput approach to study viral genome replication we demonstrate the 
formation of double-stranded head-to-tail concatemers of AAV genomes in the 
presence of HSV-1, thus providing evidence for an unequivocal rolling circle 
replication (RCR) mechanism. This stands in contrast to the textbook model of 
AAV genome replication when HSV-1 is the helper virus.
