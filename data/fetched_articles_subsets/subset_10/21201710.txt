The title compound, C(12)H(14)N(2)O(3)S, adopts a cis-trans geometry of the 
thio-urea group and is stabilized by intra-molecular hydrogen bonds between the 
carbonyl O atoms and the H atom of the thio-amide group and by a C-H⋯S 
interaction. Mol-ecules are linked by two inter-molecular hydrogen bonds (C-H⋯O 
and N-H⋯O), forming a one-dimensional chain parallel to the c axis.
