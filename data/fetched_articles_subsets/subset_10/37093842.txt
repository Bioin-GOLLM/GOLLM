Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in a wide array of human diseases 
ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to cardiovascular defects. The 
coordinated localization and import of proteins into mitochondria are essential 
processes that ensure mitochondrial homeostasis. The localization and import of 
most mitochondrial proteins are driven by N-terminal mitochondrial targeting 
sequences (MTS's), which interact with import machinery and are removed by the 
mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). The recent discovery of internal 
MTS's-those which are distributed throughout a protein and act as import 
regulators or secondary MPP cleavage sites-has expanded the role of both MTS's 
and MPP beyond conventional N-terminal regulatory pathways. Still, the global 
mutational landscape of MTS's remains poorly characterized, both from genetic 
and structural perspectives. To this end, we have integrated a variety of tools 
into one harmonized R/Shiny database called MTSviewer 
(https://neurobioinfo.github.io/MTSvieweR/), which combines MTS predictions, 
cleavage sites, genetic variants, pathogenicity predictions, and N-terminomics 
data with structural visualization using AlphaFold models of human and yeast 
mitochondrial proteomes. Using MTSviewer, we profiled all MTS-containing 
proteins across human and yeast mitochondrial proteomes and provide multiple 
case studies to highlight the utility of this database.
