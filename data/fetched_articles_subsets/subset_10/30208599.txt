Mitochondria are the energy-producing organelles of cells. Mitochondrial 
dysfunctions link to various syndromes and diseases including myoclonic epilepsy 
and ragged-red fiber disease (MERRF), Leigh syndrome (LS), and Leber hereditary 
optic neuropathy (LHON). Primary mitochondrial diseases often result from 
mutations of mitochondrial genomes and nuclear genes that encode the 
mitochondrial components. However, complete intracellular correction of the 
mutated genetic parts relevant to mitochondrial structures and functions is 
technically challenging. Instead, there have been diverse attempts to provide 
corrected genetic materials with cells. In this review, we discuss recent novel 
physical, chemical and biological strategies, and methods to introduce genetic 
cargos into mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. Effective mitochondria-targeting 
gene delivery systems can reverse multiple mitochondrial disorders by enabling 
cells to produce functional mitochondrial components.
