Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) patients have a poor prognosis. Here, we 
investigated the impact of TP53 gene mutations on prognosis of ATL treated in 
different ways. Among 177 patients, we identified 47 single nucleotide variants 
or insertion-deletions (SNVs/indels) of the TP53 gene in 37 individuals. TP53 
copy number variations (CNVs) were observed in 38 patients. Altogether, 67 of 
177 patients harboured TP53 SNVs/indels or TP53 CNVs, and were categorized as 
having TP53 mutations. In the entire cohort, median survival of patients with 
and without TP53 mutations was 1·0 and 6·7 years respectively (P < 0·001). After 
allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), median survival of 
patients with (n = 16) and without (n = 29) TP53 mutations was 0·4 years and not 
reached respectively (P = 0·001). For patients receiving mogamulizumab without 
allogeneic HSCT, the median survival from the first dose of antibody in patients 
with TP53 mutations (n = 27) was only 0·9 years, but 5·1 years in those without 
(n = 42; P < 0·001). Thus, TP53 mutations are associated with unfavourable 
prognosis of ATL, regardless of treatment strategy. The establishment of 
alternative modalities to overcome the adverse impact of TP53 mutations in 
patients with ATL is required.
