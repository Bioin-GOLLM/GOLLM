BACKGROUND: Rare mutations in the leptin (LEP) gene cause severe obesity. Common 
polymorphisms of LEP have been associated with obesity, but their association 
with cardiovascular disease has been little studied. We have examined the impact 
of both common and rare polymorphisms of the LEP gene on blood pressure (BP), 
subclinical atherosclerosis as measured by carotid intima-medial thickness 
(CIMT), and body mass index (BMI) in a large family study.
METHODS: Five polymorphisms spanning LEP were typed in 1428 individuals from 248 
nuclear families. BP, CIMT, BMI, and plasma leptin were measured.
RESULTS: The polymorphisms typed captured all common haplotypes present at LEP. 
There was strong association between a rare polymorphism in the 3' untranslated 
region of LEP (C538T) and both pulse pressure (p = 0.0001) and CIMT (p = 0.008). 
C/T heterozygotes had a 22% lower pulse pressure and a 17% lower CIMT than C/C 
homozygotes. The polymorphism accounted for 3-5% of the population variation in 
pulse pressure and CIMT. There was no association between any LEP polymorphism 
and either BMI or plasma leptin level.
CONCLUSIONS: This large family study shows that the rare T allele at the C538T 
polymorphism of LEP substantially influences pulse pressure and CIMT, but does 
not appear to exert this effect through actions on plasma leptin level or BMI. 
This suggests that autocrine or paracrine effects in vascular tissue may be 
important physiological functions of leptin. This study also provides evidence 
that rare polymorphisms of particular genes may have substantial effects within 
the normal range of certain quantitative traits.
