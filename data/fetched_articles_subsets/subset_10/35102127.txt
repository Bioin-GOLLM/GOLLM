PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by 
pulmonary and extra-pulmonary multi-morbidity including depression, anxiety and 
cognitive disorders. Several studies investigated the association of the FKBP5 
gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to anxiety, depression, and behavioral 
disorders. The FKBP5 gene codifies the FKBP51 protein which modulates the 
glucocorticoid receptor in the adaptive stress response. Genetic variants of the 
FKBP5 gene have been associated to a higher risk of developing mental disorders. 
We analyzed the association of genetic variants and stress exposure 
investigating the susceptibility to psychological distress and the impact on 
cognitive balance and quality of life (QoL) of COPD patients carrying the 
rs4713916 polymorphism (G/A) and we examined its association, with COPD 
rehabilitative outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot study evaluated cognitive, psychological, 
clinical alterations/disorders, QoL, and coping strategies in 70 older adults 
with COPD, undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation, stratified according to the 
FKBP5 rs4713916 genotype (GG or GA).
RESULTS: Carriers of rs4713916 polymorphisms (G/A) show better cognitive 
performances, a higher degree of independence in the daily living activities, 
better QoL, no presence of depressive mood and anxiety symptoms, no family 
history of psychiatric disorders, more ability to cope with stressors by 
avoiding emotions but demanding emotional support, and lesser use of 
anti-anxiety, anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, hypnotic-sedative drugs. No 
difference was found in the number of comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: These results offer valuable insights into the role of FKBP5 in the 
complex network of mechanisms associated to clinical, psychological and 
behavioral features of COPD patients.
