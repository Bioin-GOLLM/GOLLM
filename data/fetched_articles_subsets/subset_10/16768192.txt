PURPOSE: To report a novel missense mutation in the XLRS1 gene in a Korean 
family with X-linked retinoschisis.
METHODS: Observation case report of a family with a proband with X-linked 
retinoschisis underwent complete ophthalmologic examination. Genomic DNA was 
excluded from the family's blood and all exons of the XLRS1 gene were amplified 
by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed using a direct sequencing method.
RESULTS: A novel Leu103Phe missense mutation was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel Leu103Phe mutation is an additional missense mutation which 
is responsible for the pathogenesis of X-linked retinoschisis.
