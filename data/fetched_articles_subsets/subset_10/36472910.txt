    Striving toward hyperthermia-free analgesia: Lessons from loss-of-function 
mutations of human TRPV1.

Pain signals are relayed to the brain via a nociceptive system, and in rare 
cases, this nociceptive system contains genetic variants that can limit the pain 
response. Here, we questioned whether a human transient receptor potential 
vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) missense variant causes a resistance to noxious stimuli and, 
further, whether we could target this region with a cell-permeable peptide as a 
pain therapeutic. Initially using a computational approach, we identified a 
human K710N TRPV1 missense variant in an otherwise highly conserved region of 
mammalian TRPV1. After generating a TRPV1K710N-knockin mouse using CRISPR/Cas9, 
we discovered that the K710N variant reduced capsaicin-induced calcium influx in 
dorsal root ganglion neurons. The TRPV1K710N rodents also had less acute 
behavioral responses to noxious chemical stimuli and less hypersensitivity to 
nerve injury, while their response to noxious heat remained intact. Furthermore, 
blocking this K710 region in WT rodents using a cell-penetrating peptide limited 
acute behavioral responses to noxious stimuli and returned pain hypersensitivity 
induced by nerve injury to baseline levels. These findings identify K710 TRPV1 
as a discrete site that is crucial for the control of nociception and provide 
insights into how to leverage rare genetic variants in humans to uncover fresh 
strategies for developing pain therapeutics.
