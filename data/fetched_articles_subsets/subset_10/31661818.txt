Salt stress inhibits the production of all crop species, including rapeseed 
(Brassica napus L.), the second most widely planted oil crop species. Although 
melatonin was confirmed to alleviate salt stress in rapeseed seedlings recently, 
the mechanism governing the expression levels remains unknown. Therefore, the 
melatonin-induced transcriptome variation of salt-stressed seedlings was 
explored. In this study, the transcriptomes of leaves and roots under control 
(CK), salt (125 mM NaCl, ST) and melatonin (125 mM NaCl plus 50 ÂµM melatonin, 
MS) treatments were evaluated by using next-generation sequencing techniques. 
After conducting comparisons of gene expression in the roots and leaves between 
MS and ST, the differentially expressed gene (DEG) pools were screened. Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses highlighted the 
significant pathways, which were mainly related to plant hormone synthesis and 
signal transduction, lignin and fatty acid metabolism. The functional genes in 
the objective KEGG pathways were identified. Furthermore, members of several 
transcription factor (TF) families participated in the response process. 
Combined with the hormone (campesterol (CS), jasmonic acid (JA), and gibberellic 
acid 3 (GA3)) contents measured in the seedlings, it could be concluded that 
melatonin induced changes in the intrinsic hormone metabolic network, which 
promoted seedling growth. Thus, this study identified new candidate genes and 
pathways active during the interactions between melatonin and salt stress, which 
provide clues for disclosing melatonin's function in resistance to salt injury. 
Our results contribute to developing a practical method for sustainable 
agriculture on saline lands.
