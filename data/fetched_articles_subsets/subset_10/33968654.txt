BACKGROUND: Male infertility is a major health concern and approximately 10-15% 
of cases are caused by genetic abnormalities. Defects in the sperm flagella are 
closely related to male infertility, since flagellar beating allows sperm to 
swim. The sperm of males afflicted with multiple morphological abnormalities of 
the flagella (MMAF) possess severe defects of the sperm flagella, may impair 
sperm motility and lead to male infertility. Currently, known genetic defects 
only account for MMAF in about 60% of patients and need more intensive efforts 
to explore the relationship between genes and MMAF.
METHODS: The whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to analyze the genetic 
cause of the MMAF patient. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) were used to observe the morphology of sperm cells and 
to identify the ultrastructural characteristics of the flagella in the patient. 
The expression of DNAH1 was analyzed by sperm immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: We identified the negative effects produced by the DNAH1 mutations c. 
8170.C>T (p. R2724*) and c. 4670C>T (p. T1557M) on DNAH1 expression and the 
development of sperm flagella.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that DNAH1 is associated with the formation of 
sperm flagella and homozygous loss-of-function mutations in DNAH1 can impair 
sperm motility and cause male infertility.
