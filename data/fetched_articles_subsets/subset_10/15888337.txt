A common polymorphism (I405V) in exon 14 of the cholesteryl ester transfer 
protein (CETP) gene has been recently associated to healthy aging in Ashkenazi 
Jewish. In order to study this genetic effect in long-lived individuals with a 
different ethnicity, we analyzed the allele and genotype distributions of the 
CETP polymorphism a sample of Italian centenarians. Our result does not confirm 
the association between the I405V CETP variation and the healthy aging phenotype 
described in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and suggests that other gene 
environment interactions contribute to longevity.
