BACKGROUND: Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease 
characterized by destruction of exocrine glands as a result of T and B cells 
infiltrated in glandular tissue. CD28 and CTLA-4 play a crucial role in T cell 
activation and inhibition. The aim of this study was to associate CD28 and CTLA4 
haplotypes with susceptibility to pSS in patients from western Mexico.
METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism 
were performed to identify CD28 and CTLA4 genotypes in 111 patients with pSS and 
138 control subjects (CS). Haplotype analysis was carried out by SHEsis program. 
Soluble serum levels of CD28 (sCD28) and CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) were quantified by 
ELISA kit.
RESULTS: The CD28 GC haplotype was associated with low risk to pSS (2.5-folds, 
P < 0.001). CTLA4 CAG and CGA were identified as genetic risk factor 
(P < 0.001;OR = 3.82[CI95%:2.022-7.296] and P < 0.001; 
OR = 11.38[CI95%:3.282-37.69] respectively). No difference in sCD28 and sCTLA-4 
were found between patients and CS. However, pSS patients carriers of CD28 
IVS3 + 17TC genotype showed high sCD28 (P = 0.039 vs TT carriers in CS). In 
regard to sCTLA-4, patient who carry CTLA4-319C>T, +49 A>G, and +6230 G>A, or 
their haplotypes did not show any difference.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CD28 GC, CTLA4 CAG, and CGA haplotypes are 
associated with susceptibility to pSS in patients from western Mexico. It seems 
that genetic control of CD28 and CTLA4 as well as local immune response in 
glandular tissue may regulate the impact of the gene expression in pSS. It is 
necessary to confirm this hypothesis in an integrative study.
