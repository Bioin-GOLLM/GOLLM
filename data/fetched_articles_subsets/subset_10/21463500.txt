BACKGROUND: The Pax transcription factor gene eyegone (eyg) participates in many 
developmental processes in Drosophila, including the Notch signaling activated 
postembryonic growth of the eye primordium, global development of the adult head 
and the development of the antenna. In contrast to other Pax genes, the 
functional conservation of eyg in species other than Drosophila has not yet been 
explored.
RESULTS: We investigated the role of eyg during the postembryonic development of 
the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. Our results indicate conserved roles 
in antennal but not in eye development. Besides segmentation defects in the 
antenna, Tribolium eyg knockdown animals were characterized by eye enlargement 
due to the formation of surplus ommatidia at the central anterior edge of the 
compound eye. This effect resulted from the failure of the developing gena to 
locally repress retinal differentiation, which underlies the formation of the 
characteristic anterior notch in the Tribolium eye. Neither varying the 
induction time point of eyg knockdown nor knocking down components of the Janus 
kinase/Signal Transducer and Activators of Transcription signaling pathway in 
combination with eyg reduced eye size like in Drosophila.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, expression and knockdown data suggest that 
Tribolium eyg serves as a competence factor that facilitates the repression of 
retinal differentiation in response to an unknown signal produced in the 
developing gena. At the comparative level, our findings reveal diverged roles of 
eyg associated with the evolution of different modes of postembryonic head 
development in endopterygote insects as well as diversified head morphologies in 
darkling beetles.
