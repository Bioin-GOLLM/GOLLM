The title compound, C31H22N2, crystallizes with two symmetry-independent 
mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit. The mol-ecules have slightly different 
conformations, the dihedral angles between the central phenyl ring and the 
carbazolyl groups being 56.29 (4) and 59.57 (4)° in one mol-ecule and 48.71 (4) 
and 65.47 (4)° in the other. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked by weak C-H⋯π 
and π-π [centroid-centroid distances = 3.7698 (10), 3.8292 (9), 3.9429 (10) and 
3.9431 (10) Å].
