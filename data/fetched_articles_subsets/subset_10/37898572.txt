SARS-CoV-2 and its variants cause CoronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19), a pandemic 
disease. Hematological malignancies increase susceptibility to severe COVID-19 
due to immunosuppression. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies protect 
against severe COVID-19. This retrospective real-life study aimed to evaluate 
seropositivity and neutralizing antibody rates against SARS-CoV-2 and its 
Omicron BA.1 variant in hematological patients. A total of 106 patients with 
different hematologic malignancies, who have mostly received three or more 
vaccine doses (73%), were included in this study. Serum was collected between 
May and June 2022. The primary endpoint was anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response 
against ancestral (wild type; wt) and Omicron BA.1 virus, defined as a 
neutralizing antibody titer ≥ 1:10. Adequate neutralizing antibody response was 
observed in 75 (71%) and 87 (82%) of patients for wt and Omicron BA.1 variants, 
respectively.However, patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and/or 
those treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies in the prior 12 months showed 
a lower seropositivity rate compared to other patients against both Omicron BA.1 
variant (73% vs 91%; P = 0.02) and wt virus (64% vs 78%; P = 0.16). Our 
real-life experience confirmed that full vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 induces 
adequate neutralizing antibody protection for both the wt virus and Omicron BA.1 
variants, even in hematological frail patients. However, protective measures 
should be maintained in hematological patients, especially those with B-cell 
lymphoproliferative diseases treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, 
because these subjects could have a reduced neutralizing antibody production.
