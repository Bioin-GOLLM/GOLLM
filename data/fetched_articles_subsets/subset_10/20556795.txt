Biotinidase deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the vitamin, biotin, is 
not recycled. Individuals with biotinidase deficiency can develop neurological 
and cutaneous symptoms if they are not treated with biotin. Biotinidase 
deficiency screening has been incorporated into essentially all newborn 
screening programs in the United States and in many countries. We now report 140 
known mutations in the biotinidase gene (BTD) that cause biotinidase deficiency. 
All types of mutations have been found to cause biotinidase deficiency. Variants 
have been identified throughout the coding sequence. Essentially all the 
variants result in enzymatic activities with less than 10% of mean normal enzyme 
activity (profound biotinidase deficiency) with the exception of the c.1330G>C 
(p.D444H) mutation, which results in an enzyme having 50% of mean normal serum 
activity. The putative three-dimensional structure of biotinidase has been 
predicted by homology to that of nitrilases/amidases. The effect of the various 
missense mutations can be predicted to affect various important sites within the 
structure of the enzyme. This compilation of variants causing biotinidase 
deficiency will be useful to clinical laboratories that are performing mutation 
analysis for confirmational testing when the enzymatic results are equivocal for 
children identified through newborn screening.
