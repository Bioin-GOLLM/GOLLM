Enhanced mitochondrial stability and decreased dependence on oxidative 
phosphorylation confer an acquired resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells, but 
may present opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The compound 
pancratistatin (PST) has been shown to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer 
cells. However, its low availability in nature has hindered its clinical 
advancement. We synthesized PST analogs and a medium-throughput screen was 
completed. Analogs SVTH-7, -6, and -5 demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity 
greater than PST and several standard chemotherapeutics. They disrupted 
mitochondrial function, activated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and reduced 
growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. Interestingly, the pro-apoptotic effects of 
SVTH-7 on cancer cells and mitochondria were abrogated with the inhibition of 
mitochondrial complex II and III, suggesting mitochondrial or metabolic 
vulnerabilities may be exploited by this analog. This work provides a scaffold 
for characterizing distinct mitochondrial and metabolic features of cancer cells 
and reveals several lead compounds with high therapeutic potential.
