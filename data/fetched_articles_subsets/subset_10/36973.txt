Purification of UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine reductase from Escherichia 
coli by affinity chromatography, its subunit structure and the absence of flavin 
as the prosthetic group.

Anwar RA, Vlaovic M.

The enzyme UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine reductase (EC 1.1.1.158) was 
purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli by affinity chromatography on a 
NADP-agarose column. The evidence suggests that the enzyme (molecular weight 
35,000) is composed of two nonidentical subunits of molecular weight 21,500 and 
13,500, respectively. The absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme shows no 
absorption band around 450 nm and thus does not support the previous suggestions 
that the enzyme is a flavoprotein. However, the A280: A260 ratio gives a value 
of 0.86 which suggests the presence of tightly bound nucleotide. A quantitative 
transfer of tritium from 1,4-[4-3H]NADPH to UDP-N-acetylenolpyruvoylglucosamine 
to form UDP-N-E13H]acetylmuramic acid was also observed, which clearly shows 
that the enzyme is not a flavoprotein.
