Firefly luciferase (EC.1.13.12.7) from Photinus pyralis is a single polypeptide 
chain (62 kDa), responsible for emission of yellow-green (557 nm) light, known 
to be most efficient bioluminescence system that make it an excellent tool for 
reporter in nano-system biology. However, it is very sensitive to proteolytic 
degradation, which reduces its intracellular half-life, leads to loss in 
sensitivity and precision in analytic applications. In order to generate more 
stable luciferases against protease digestion, we substituted two tryptic sites: 
R(213), R(337) and also next residue to it (Q(338)) with another amino acids. 
Overall, all mutations brought about structural changes that indicated more 
compact structure upon mutation, which revealed by enhancement of tryptophan 
fluorescence, decreases flexibility and less surface hydrophobic pockets. In 
general, structural changes associated with a clear improvement in 
thermostability and resistance against trypsin hydrolysis. In particular, R337Q 
mutant shows higher light stability in mammalian cell culture, which makes it as 
a suitable reporter for imaging.
