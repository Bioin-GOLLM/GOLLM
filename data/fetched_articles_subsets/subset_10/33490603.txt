PURPOSE: To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) after an intravitreal 
triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) between vitrectomised and non-vitrectomised eyes 
in patients with diabetes and diabetic macular oedema (DME).
DESIGN: Retrospective comparative study.
METHODS: Medical records of 157 patients (157 eyes) with type 2 diabetes who 
received IVTA for DME were reviewed, and the best-corrected visual acuity, IOP 
and optical central retinal thickness (CRT) were compared preoperatively, at 1, 
4, 12 and 24 weeks after IVTA between the vitrectomised and non-vitrectomised 
groups.
RESULTS: IOP significantly increased at 1 (p<0.0001), 4 (p<0.0001), 8 
(p<0.0001), 12 (p=0.0019), 16 (p=0.0006) and 20 weeks (p=0.0191) in the 
non-vitrectomised group, whereas a significant increase was only observed at 1 
(p=0.0003) and 4 weeks (p=0.0006) in the vitrectomised group. ΔIOP, IOP changes 
from baseline, in the non-vitrectomised group was significantly higher than that 
in the vitrectomised group at 4 (p=0.0014), 8 (p=0.0081), 12 (p=0.0032) and 16 
weeks (p=0.0038). No significant difference was observed in logMAR and CRT at 
any time point after IVTA between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: After an initial IVTA, increased IOP and ΔIOP from the baseline IOP 
were significantly more frequently observed in the non-vitrectomised than that 
in the vitrectomised group. IVTA is a safer and more effective treatment option 
for DME in vitrectomised than that in non-vitrectomised eyes.
