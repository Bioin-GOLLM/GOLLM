Inhibitors of mTOR, including clinically available rapalogs such as rapamycin 
(Sirolimus) and Everolimus, are gerosuppressants, which suppress cellular 
senescence. Rapamycin slows aging and extends life span in a variety of species 
from worm to mammals. Rapalogs can prevent age-related diseases, including 
cancer, atherosclerosis, obesity, neurodegeneration and retinopathy and 
potentially rejuvenate stem cells, immunity and metabolism. Here, I further 
suggest how rapamycin can be combined with metformin, inhibitors of angiotensin 
II signaling (Losartan, Lisinopril), statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin), 
propranolol, aspirin and a PDE5 inhibitor. Rational combinations of these drugs 
with physical exercise and an anti-aging diet (Koschei formula) can maximize 
their anti-aging effects and decrease side effects.
