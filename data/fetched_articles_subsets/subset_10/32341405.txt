Congenital heart disease (CHD) survivors are at risk for neurodevelopmental 
disability (NDD), and recent studies identify genes associated with both 
disorders, suggesting that NDD in CHD survivors may be of genetic origin. Genes 
contributing to neurogenesis, dendritic development and synaptogenesis organize 
neural elements into networks known as the connectome. We hypothesized that NDD 
in CHD may be attributable to genes altering both neural connectivity and 
cardiac patterning. To assess the contribution of de novo variants (DNVs) in 
connectome genes, we annotated 229 published NDD genes for connectome status and 
analyzed data from 3,684 CHD subjects and 1,789 controls for connectome gene 
mutations. CHD cases had more protein truncating and deleterious missense DNVs 
among connectome genes compared to controls (OR = 5.08, 95%CI:2.81-9.20, 
Fisher's exact test P = 6.30E-11). When removing three known syndromic CHD 
genes, the findings remained significant (OR = 3.69, 95%CI:2.02-6.73, Fisher's 
exact test P = 1.06E-06). In CHD subjects, the top 12 NDD genes with damaging 
DNVs that met statistical significance after Bonferroni correction (PTPN11, 
CHD7, CHD4, KMT2A, NOTCH1, ADNP, SMAD2, KDM5B, NSD2, FOXP1, MED13L, DYRK1A; 
one-tailed binomial test P ≤ 4.08E-05) contributed to the connectome. These data 
suggest that NDD in CHD patients may be attributable to genes that alter both 
cardiac patterning and the connectome.
