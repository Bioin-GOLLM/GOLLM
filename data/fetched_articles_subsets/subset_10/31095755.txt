INTRODUCTION: With increasing life expectancy, comorbidities become overt in 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Although micturition problems are common, 
bladder function is poorly understood in DMD. We studied dystrophin expression 
and multiple isoform involvement in the bladder during maturation to gain 
insights into their roles in micturition.
METHODS: Dystrophin distribution was evaluated in rat bladders by 
immunohistochemical colocalization with smooth muscle, interstitial, urothelial, 
and neuronal markers. Protein levels of Dp140, Dp71, and smooth muscle were 
quantitated by Western blotting of neonatal to adult rat bladders.
RESULTS: Dystrophin colocalized with smooth muscle cells and afferent nerve 
fibers. Dp71 was expressed two- to threefold higher compared with Dp140, 
independently of age. Age-related muscle mass changes did not influence isoform 
expression levels.
DISCUSSION: Dystrophin is expressed in smooth muscle cells and afferent nerve 
fibers in the urinary bladder, which underscores that micturition problems in 
DMD may have not solely a myogenic but also a neurogenic origin. Muscle Nerve
