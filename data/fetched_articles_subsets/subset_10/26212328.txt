Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by recurrent mutations that affect 
the epigenetic regulatory machinery and signaling molecules, leading to a block 
in hematopoietic differentiation. Constitutive signaling from mutated growth 
factor receptors is a major driver of leukemic growth, but how aberrant 
signaling affects the epigenome in AML is less understood. Furthermore, AML 
cells undergo extensive clonal evolution, and the mutations in signaling genes 
are often secondary events. To elucidate how chronic growth factor signaling 
alters the transcriptional network in AML, we performed a system-wide 
multi-omics study of primary cells from patients suffering from AML with 
internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 transmembrane domain (FLT3-ITD). This 
strategy revealed cooperation between the MAP kinase (MAPK) inducible 
transcription factor AP-1 and RUNX1 as a major driver of a common, 
FLT3-ITD-specific gene expression and chromatin signature, demonstrating a major 
impact of MAPK signaling pathways in shaping the epigenome of FLT3-ITD AML.
