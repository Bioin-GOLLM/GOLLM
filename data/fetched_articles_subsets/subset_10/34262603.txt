Systematic approaches for functionally validating cancer genes are needed since 
numerous genes mutated in cancer tissues have been identified from cancer genome 
sequencing. The mouse organoid culture system has been extensively used in the 
field of cancer research since mouse organoids can faithfully recapitulate the 
physiological behavior of the cells. Taking advantage of this, we recently 
described a platform for functionally validating colorectal cancer (CRC) driver 
genes that utilized CRISPR-Cas9 in mouse intestinal tumor organoids. In this 
review, we will describe how mouse organoids have been applied to CRC research 
and focus on how CRC genes can be validated using mouse organoids.
