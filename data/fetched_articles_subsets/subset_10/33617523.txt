Phenotypic profiling of large three-dimensional microscopy data sets has not 
been widely adopted due to the challenges posed by cell segmentation and feature 
selection. The computational demands of automated processing further limit 
analysis of hard-to-segment images such as of neurons and organoids. Here we 
describe a comprehensive shallow-learning framework for automated quantitative 
phenotyping of three-dimensional (3D) image data using unsupervised data-driven 
voxel-based feature learning, which enables computationally facile 
classification, clustering and advanced data visualization. We demonstrate the 
analysis potential on complex 3D images by investigating the phenotypic 
alterations of: neurons in response to apoptosis-inducing treatments and 
morphogenesis for oncogene-expressing human mammary gland acinar organoids. Our 
novel implementation of image analysis algorithms called Phindr3D allowed rapid 
implementation of data-driven voxel-based feature learning into 3D high content 
analysis (HCA) operations and constitutes a major practical advance as the 
computed assignments represent the biology while preserving the heterogeneity of 
the underlying data. Phindr3D is provided as Matlab code and as a stand-alone 
program (https://github.com/DWALab/Phindr3D).
