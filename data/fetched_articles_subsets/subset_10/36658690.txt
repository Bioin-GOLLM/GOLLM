Dendritic cell (DC) migration is a fundamental step during execution of its 
adaptive immunity functions. Studying DC migration characteristics is critical 
for development of DC-dependent allergy treatments, vaccines, and cancer 
immunotherapies. Here, a microfluidics-based single-cell migration platform is 
described that enables high-throughput and precise bidirectional cell migration 
assays. It also allows selective retrieval of cell subpopulations that have 
different migratory potentials. Using this microfluidic platform, DC migration 
is investigated in response to different chemoattractants and inhibitors, 
quantitatively describe DC migration patterns and retrieve DC subpopulations of 
different migratory potentials for differential gene expression analysis. This 
platform opens an avenue for precise characterization of cell migration and 
potential discovery of therapeutic modulators.
