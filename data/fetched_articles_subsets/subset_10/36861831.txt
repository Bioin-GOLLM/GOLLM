There is conflicting evidence regarding the mechanisms of α-synuclein 
internalization, and its trafficking itinerary following cellular entry remains 
largely unknown. To examine these issues, we describe steps for coupling 
α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs) to nanogold beads and their subsequent 
characterization by electron microscopy (EM). Then we describe the uptake of 
conjugated PFFs by U2OS cells plated on Permanox 8-well chamber slides. This 
process eliminates the reliance on antibody specificity and the need to employ 
complex immunoEM staining protocols. For complete details on the use and 
execution of this protocol, please refer to Bayati et al. (2022).1.
