Uveitis is a potentially sight-threatening disease characterized by repeated 
cycles of remission and recurrent inflammation. The JAK/STAT pathway regulates 
the differentiation of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells that mediate uveitis. A 
SOCS1 mimetic peptide (SOCS1-KIR) that inhibits JAK2/STAT1 pathways has recently 
been shown to suppress experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). However, it is not 
clear whether SOCS1-KIR ameliorated uveitis by targeting JAK/STAT pathways of 
pathogenic lymphocytes or via inhibition of macrophages and antigen-presenting 
cells that also enter the retina during EAU. To further investigate mechanisms 
that mediate SOCS1-KIR effects and evaluate the efficacy of SOCS1-KIR as an 
investigational drug for chronic uveitis, we induced EAU in rats by adoptive 
transfer of uveitogenic T-cells and monitored disease progression and severity 
by slit-lamp microscopy, histology, and optical coherence tomography. Topical 
administration of SOCS1-KIR ameliorated acute and chronic posterior uveitis by 
inhibiting Th17 cells and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into retina 
while promoting expansion of IL-10-producing Tregs. We further show that 
SOCS1-KIR conferred protection of resident retinal cells that play critical role 
in vision from cytotoxic effects of inflammatory cytokines by downregulating 
proapoptotic genes. Thus, SOCS1-KIR suppresses uveitis and confers 
neuroprotective effects and might be exploited as a noninvasive treatment for 
chronic uveitis.
