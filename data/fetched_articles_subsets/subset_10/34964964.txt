OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a neonate affected with Glutaric 
aciduria type I (GA-I).
METHODS: Targeted capture and high-throughput sequencing was carried out for the 
proband and her parents. Candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: The proband was found to harbor compound heterozygous variants of the 
GCDH gene, namely c.523G>A and c.1190T>C, which was derived from her father and 
mother, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The compound heterozygous variants of the GCDH gene probably 
underlay the GA-I in the patient.
