Cancer is one of the most important causes of death worldwide. Solid tumors 
represent the vast majority of cancers (>90%), and the chemotherapeutic agents 
used for their treatment are still characterized by variable efficacy and 
toxicity. Sesquiterpenes are a group of natural compounds that have shown a wide 
range of biological activities, including cytotoxic and antiparasitic activity, 
among others. The antiproliferative activity of natural sesquiterpenes, tessaric 
acid, ilicic acid, and ilicic alcohol and their semisynthetic derivatives 
against HeLa, T-47D, WiDr, A549, HBL-100, and SW1573 cell lines were evaluated. 
The effect of the compounds on Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes was also 
assessed. The selectivity index was calculated using murine splenocytes. 
Derivatives 13 and 15 were the most antiproliferative compounds, with GI50 
values ranging between 5.3 (±0.32) and 14 (±0.90) μM, in all cell lines tested. 
The presence of 1,2,3-triazole groups in derivatives 15−19 led to improvements 
in activity compared to those corresponding to the starting natural product (3), 
with GI50 values ranging between 12 (±1.5) and 17 (±1.1) μM and 16 being the 
most active compound. In relation to the anti-T. cruzi activity, derivatives 7 
and 16 obtained from tessaric acid and ilicic acid were among the most active 
and selective compounds with IC50 values of 9.3 and 8.8 µM (SI = 8.0 and 9.4), 
respectively.
