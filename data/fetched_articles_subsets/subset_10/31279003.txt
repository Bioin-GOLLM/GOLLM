OBJECTIVE: Host genetic factors play an important role in susceptibility to 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection and tuberculosis (TB). Receptor 
interacting-serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) is a critical adapter 
protein for signal propagation of NOD2, dysregulation of which leads to defects 
in bacterial detection. To investigate the role of RIPK2 on the susceptibility 
of tuberculosis, we conducted a large sample size case-control study in a 
Western Chinese Han population.
METHODS: Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near to RIPK2 
were genotyped in 1359 TB cases and 1534 controls using the improved multiplex 
ligation detection reaction method in a case-control study.
RESULTS: Of the five variants, rs39509 was observed to be associated with TB 
risk in the allelic effects (P = 0.015), additive (P = 0.020) and recessive 
model (P = 0.005) after Bonferroni correction. Rs39509 might fall in putative 
functional regions and might be eQTL for the RIPK2 and long non-coding RNA 
RP11-37B2.1 according to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings firstly exhibit that the G allele of rs39509 in 
nearGene-3 region of RIPK2 might serve as a hazard for TB in this Western 
Chinese Han population. Further validation studies on a variety of ethnic 
populations and function experiments are needed to confirm the roles of the 
variants identified.
