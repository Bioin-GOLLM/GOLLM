BACKGROUND: Germline pathogenic variants in the cadherin-1 (CDH1) gene cause a 
predisposition to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). We report an HDGC 
case in Vietnam and identify a novel mutation in the CDH1 gene.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old Vietnamese man was diagnosed with HDGC and a 
novel mutation at c.639G>A. All exons of CDH1 were sequenced in his pedigree, 
which revealed the c.639G>A mutation in the proband, his father, and uncle. The 
patient refused treatment and died 4Â months after diagnosis. Endoscopic 
surveillance of the father and the uncle showed structural abnormalities in the 
father.
CONCLUSION: In cases of HDGC, identification of the CDH1 gene mutation is very 
important for better counseling and more effective strategies to prevent the 
development of diseases, such as prophylactic gastrectomy for family members 
with genetic mutations.
