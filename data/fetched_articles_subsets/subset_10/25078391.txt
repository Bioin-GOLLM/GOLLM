ITGB6 is known to be one of the major receptor components involved in host 
tropism of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus in cattle. A competitive PCR 
technique called ARMS PCR was adapted to identify a single-nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP), G29A, db SNP Id: rs109075046, in the 5' untranslated region 
(5'UTR) of the bovine ITGB6 gene. Genotype profiling identified three kinds of 
genetic variation within the targeted SNP among Frieswal crossbred cattle. The 
occurrence of FMD in the three genotypes was further evaluated, revealing a 
clear role in the incidence of FMD in the studied population.
