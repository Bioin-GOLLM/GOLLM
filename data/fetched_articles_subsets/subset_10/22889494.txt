PURPOSE: To correlate candidate polymorphisms affecting pemetrexed and 
carboplatin activity with clinical outcome of patients with advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated in second-line with pemetrexed or pemetrexed 
plus carboplatin.
METHODS: Functional polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase (TS), reduced folate 
carrier (RFC), gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH), methylenetetrahydrofolate 
reductase (MTHFR) and xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) genes were evaluated 
in 208 patients either treated within randomized phase II trials NVALT-7 and 
GOIRC-02.2006, comparing second-line pemetrexed with pemetrexed plus 
carboplatin, or with the same regimens outside of these trials. Univariate and 
multivariate analyses correlated genotyping data with response, clinical 
benefit, toxicity, progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using 
Pearson-χ2 test, log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Patients harboring the MTHFR-T667T variant had significantly longer PFS 
(5.4 versus 3.4 months; p=0.012) and OS (16.4 versus 8.5 months; p=0.026) than 
patients with CC-CT genotypes. No correlation was observed for other 
polymorphisms, except for XPD-Gln751Gln, which was associated with shorter PFS 
(p=0.021) and OS (p=0.044) in the subgroup of patients treated with pemetrexed 
plus carboplatin. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic 
significance of MTHFR-C677T both in risk of disease progression (CC-CT genotypes 
hazard ratio [HR] 1.94, 95%CI 1.15-3.28; p=0.012) and of death (HR 2.00, 95% CI 
1.12-3.54; p=0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: MTHFR-C667T polymorphisms appear to predict survival differences in 
pemetrexed-treated NSCLC. These results should be validated in larger and 
adequately designed prospective studies using pemetrexed.
