Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a heterozygous 
mutation of the FBN1 gene. MFS patients present oxidative stress that disturbs 
redox homeostasis. Redox homeostasis depends in part on the enzymatic 
antioxidant system, which includes thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione 
peroxidases (GPx), both of which require an adequate concentration of selenium 
(Se). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if Se levels are 
decreased in the TAA of patients with MFS since this could contribute to the 
formation of an aneurysm in these patients. The results show that interleukins 
IL-1β, IL-6 TGF-β1, and TNF-α (p ≤ 0.03), and carbonylation (p ≤ 0.03) were 
increased in the TAA of patients with MFS in comparison with control subjects, 
while Se, thiols (p = 0.02), TrxR, and GPx (p ≤ 0.001) were decreased. TLR4 and 
NOX1 (p ≤ 0.03), MMP9 and MMP2 (p = 0.04) and NOS2 (p < 0.001) were also 
increased. Therefore, Se concentrations are decreased in the TAA of MFS, which 
can contribute to a decrease in the activities of TrxR and GPx, and thiol 
groups. A decrease in the activities of these enzymes can lead to the loss of 
redox homeostasis, which can, in turn, lead to an increase in the 
pro-inflammatory interleukins associated with the overexpression of MMP9 and 
MMP2.
