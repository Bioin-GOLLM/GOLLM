We report a further case of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia - corner fracture type 
due to the fibronectin-1 gene (SMD-FN1) in a child originally thought to have 
metaphyseal chondrodysplasia-Brussels type (MCD Brussels). We highlight 
phenotypic differences with the SMD-FN1 published reports. This case is unique 
in terms of the method of molecular confirmation. Findings from the 100 000 
Genomes Project were originally negative (in both tier 1 and 2); however, 
subsequent reanalysis, initiated by an automated search for new gene-disease 
associations in PanelApp, highlighted a candidate diagnostic variant. Our child 
had short stature, facial dysmorphism, spondylometaphyseal dysplasia and corner 
fractures and a heterozygous de novo missense variant in FN1 (c.675C>G 
p.(Cys225Trp), which was likely pathogenic. The variant matched the clinical and 
radiological features and a diagnosis of SMD-FN1 was confirmed. We explore the 
diagnostic journey of this patient, compare her findings with the previous 15 
patients reported with SMD-FN1 and discuss the diagnostic utility of automated 
reanalysis. We consider differences and similarities between MCD Brussels and 
SMD-FN1, by reviewing literature on both conditions and assess whether they are 
in fact the same disorder.
