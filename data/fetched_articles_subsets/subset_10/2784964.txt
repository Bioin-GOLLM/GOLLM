To explore the possibility that the mechanism of action of methotrexate (MTX) in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is related to modulation of interleukin-1 (IL-1), the 
effects of MTX on IL-1 production and activity were evaluated. Human peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells and murine peritoneal and splenic cells were stimulated 
by lipopolysaccharide to produce IL-1. No inhibition of IL-1 synthesis or 
secretion caused by MTX treatment could be demonstrated either in vitro or in 
vivo, in patients with RA or in mice treated with MTX. We did show, however, 
that MTX had an inhibitory effect on IL-1 activity in 2 assays that demonstrate 
2 different functions of IL-1. In a 2-step assay using LBRM-33-1A5 (1A5) and 
CTLD cells, MTX inhibited the secretion of IL-2 by 1A5 lymphoma cells in 
response to phytohemagglutinin and IL-1. In an assay using D10.G4.1 (D10) cells, 
MTX inhibited IL-1-induced proliferation of the D10 T cell clone. No effect of 
the drug on IL-2 activity was observed. The results demonstrate that MTX is 
capable of inhibiting some IL-1 activities without affecting IL-1 production or 
secretion. We propose that the inhibition of IL-1 activity or IL-1-dependent 
events may be one of the mechanisms of action of MTX in RA.
