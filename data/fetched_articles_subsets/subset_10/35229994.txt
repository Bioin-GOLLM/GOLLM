BACKGROUND: Largely due to incidental detection, asymptomatic pancreatic cystic 
lesions (PCLs) have become prevalent in recent years. Among them, intraductal 
papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) infrequently advances to pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Conservative surveillance versus surgical intervention is 
a difficult clinical decision for both caregivers and PCL patients. Because 
RNF43 loss-of-function mutations and KRAS gain-of-function mutations concur in a 
subset of IPMN and PDAC, their biological significance and therapeutic potential 
should be elucidated.
METHODS: Pancreatic Rnf43 knockout and Kras activated mice (Rnf43-/-; KrasG12D) 
were generated to evaluate their clinical significance in pancreatic 
pre-neoplastic initiation and malignant transformation.
RESULTS: Loss of Rnf43 potentiated the occurrence and severity of IPMN and PDAC 
in oncogenic Kras mice. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was activated in 
pancreatic KrasG12D and Rnf43 knockout mice and the PORCN inhibitor LGK974 
blocked pancreatic IPMN initiation and progression to PDAC accordingly.
CONCLUSIONS: Rnf43 is a tumor suppressor in the prevention of pancreatic 
malignant transformation. This genetically reconstituted autochthonous 
pancreatic Rnf43-/-; KrasG12D preclinical cancer model recapitulates the 
pathological process from pancreatic cyst to cancer in humans and can be treated 
with inhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Since the presence of RNF43 and KRAS 
mutations in IPMNs predicts future development of advanced neoplasia from PCLs, 
patients with these genetic anomalies warrant surveillance, surgery, and/or 
targeted therapeutics such as Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors.
