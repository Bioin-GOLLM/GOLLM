Antibody response to phosphorylcholine in vitro. II. Analysis of T-dependent and 
T-independent responses.

Quint√°ns J, Cosenza H.

Spleen cells from BALB/c mice primed with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), were 
stimulated with heat-killed vaccine of rough Pneumococcus pneumoniae R36A (Pn) 
and/or phosphorylcholine (PC)-coupled KLH to induce an anti-PC response in 
vitro. The response to PC-KLH was found to be T-dependent while it is 
T-independent to Pn. The antibodies induced with either antigen had similar 
avidity and expressed the TEPC 15 idiotype exclusively; thus T cell involvement 
in the response to PC-KLH failed to alter these parameters of the anti-PC 
response. At the precursor cell level, Pn induced small clones with an average 
size of 10 plaque-forming cells (PFC), whereas PC-KLH gave rise to larger clones 
of 40-50 PFC. This difference in the proliferative potential of PC precursor B 
cells hinted at the possibility that Pn and PC-KLH were stimulating different 
precursors. This was corroborated by the observation that a) when Pn and PC-KLH 
were added to the same cultures a synergistic effect was seen, i.e. the number 
of plaques was greater than the sum of the responses induced by each antigen, 
and b) in microcultures, under conditions limiting B cells only, Pn plus PC-KLH 
induced a higher fraction of responding wells than either antigen on its own. We 
postulate that Pn and PC-KLH stimulate subpopulations of PC precursor cells 
which are T-independent and T-dependent, respectively.
