BACKGROUND: Influenza continues to have a substantial socioeconomic and health 
impact despite a long established vaccination programme and approved antivirals. 
Preclinical data suggest that combining antivirals might be more effective than 
administering oseltamivir alone in the treatment of influenza.
METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, multicentre phase 2 trial of a 
combination of oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin versus oseltamivir 
monotherapy with matching placebo for the treatment of influenza in 50 sites, 
consisting of academic medical centre clinics, emergency rooms, and private 
physician offices in the USA, Thailand, Mexico, Argentina, and Australia. 
Participants who were aged at least 18 years with influenza and were at 
increased risk of complications were randomly assigned (1:1) by an online 
computer-generated randomisation system to receive either oseltamivir (75 mg), 
amantadine (100 mg), and ribavirin (600 mg) combination therapy or oseltamivir 
monotherapy twice daily for 5 days, given orally, and participants were followed 
up for 28 days. Blinded treatment kits were used to achieve masking of patients 
and staff. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants with virus 
detectable by PCR in nasopharyngeal swab at day 3, and was assessed in 
participants who were randomised, had influenza infection confirmed by the 
central laboratory on a baseline nasopharyngeal sample, and had received at 
least one dose of study drug. Safety assessment was done in all patients in the 
intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01227967.
FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2011, and April 29, 2016, 633 participants were 
randomly assigned to receive combination antiviral therapy (n=316) or 
monotherapy (n=317). Seven participants were excluded from analysis: three were 
not properly randomised, three withdrew from the study, and one was lost to 
follow-up. The primary analysis included 394 participants, excluding 47 in the 
pilot phase, 172 without confirmed influenza, and 13 without an endpoint sample. 
80 (40·0%) of 200 participants in the combination group had detectable virus at 
day 3 compared with 97 (50·0%) of 194 (mean difference 10·0, 95% CI 0·2-19·8, 
p=0·046) in the monotherapy group. The most common adverse events were 
gastrointestinal-related disorders, primarily nausea (65 [12%] of 556 reported 
adverse events in the combination group vs 63 [11%] of 585 reported adverse 
events in the monotherapy group), diarrhoea (56 [10%] of 556 vs 64 [11%] of 
585), and vomiting (39 [7%] of 556 vs 23 [4%] of 585). There was no benefit in 
multiple clinical secondary endpoints, such as median duration of symptoms (4·5 
days in the combination group vs 4·0 days in the monotherapy group; p=0·21). One 
death occurred in the study in an elderly participant in the monotherapy group 
who died of cardiovascular failure 13 days after randomisation, judged by the 
site investigator as not related to study intervention.
INTERPRETATION: Although combination treatment showed a significant decrease in 
viral shedding at day 3 relative to monotherapy, this difference was not 
associated with improved clinical benefit. More work is needed to understand why 
there was no clinical benefit when a difference in virological outcome was 
identified.
