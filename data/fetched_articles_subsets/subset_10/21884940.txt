Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), along with protein-tyrosine kinases, play 
key roles in cellular signaling. All Class I PTPs contain an essential active 
site cysteinyl residue, which executes a nucleophilic attack on substrate 
phosphotyrosyl residues. The high reactivity of the catalytic cysteine also 
predisposes PTPs to oxidation by reactive oxygen species, such as H(2)O(2). 
Reversible PTP oxidation is emerging as an important cellular regulatory 
mechanism and might contribute to diseases such as cancer. We exploited these 
unique features of PTP enzymology to develop proteomic methods, broadly 
applicable to cell and tissue samples, that enable the comprehensive 
identification and quantification of expressed classical PTPs (PTPome) and the 
oxidized subset of the PTPome (oxPTPome). We find that mouse and human cells and 
tissues, including cancer cells, display distinctive PTPomes and oxPTPomes, 
revealing additional levels of complexity in the regulation of protein-tyrosine 
phosphorylation in normal and malignant cells.
