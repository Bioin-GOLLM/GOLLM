BACKGROUND: The epigenetic mechanisms involved in the progression of pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to 
identify key transcription factors (TFs) through multiomics sequencing to 
investigate the molecular mechanisms of TFs that play critical roles in PDAC.
METHODS: To characterise the epigenetic landscape of genetically engineered 
mouse models (GEMMs) of PDAC with or without KRAS and/or TP53 mutations, we 
employed ATAC-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq. The effect of Fos-like antigen 
2 (FOSL2) on survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and 
multivariate Cox regression analysis for PDAC patients. To study the potential 
targets of FOSL2, we performed Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation 
(CUT&Tag). To explore the functions and underlying mechanisms of FOSL2 in PDAC 
progression, we employed several assays, including CCK8, transwell migration and 
invasion, RT-qPCR, Western blotting analysis, IHC, ChIP-qPCR, dual-luciferase 
reporter, and xenograft models.
RESULTS: Our findings indicated that epigenetic changes played a role in 
immunosuppressed signalling during PDAC progression. Moreover, we identified 
FOSL2 as a critical regulator that was up-regulated in PDAC and associated with 
poor prognosis in patients. FOSL2 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion. Importantly, our research revealed that FOSL2 acted as a downstream 
target of the KRAS/MAPK pathway and recruited regulatory T (Treg) cells by 
transcriptionally activating C-C motif chemokine ligand 28 (CCL28). This 
discovery highlighted the role of an immunosuppressed regulatory axis involving 
KRAS/MAPK-FOSL2-CCL28-Treg cells in the development of PDAC.
CONCLUSION: Our study uncovered that KRAS-driven FOSL2 promoted PDAC progression 
by transcriptionally activating CCL28, revealing an immunosuppressive role for 
FOSL2 in PDAC.
