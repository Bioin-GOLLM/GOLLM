BACKGROUND: Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of most common childhood tumors with high 
mortality among children worldwide. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to 
play essential roles in the pathogenesis and therapeutics of NB. However, the 
role of miR-149 and its mechanism remain poorly understood.
MAIN METHODS: The expression levels of miR-149, cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) 
and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) were measured in NB tissues or cells by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot. Cell 
proliferation was measured by 
3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and 
colony formation assays. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. 
Chemosensitivity of NB cells to doxorubicin (Dox) was analyzed by MTT assay. The 
interaction between miR-149 and CDC42 or BCL2 was explored by luciferase 
activity and RNA immunoprecipitation analyses.
RESULTS: Our data indicated that low expression of miR-149 was displayed in NB 
tissues and cells and associated with poor survival rate. Overexpression of 
miR-149 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation but promoted cell 
apoptosis and chemosensitivity to Dox in NB cells. Moreover, CDC42 and BCL2 were 
targeted by miR-149. Additionally, CDC42 and BCL2 mRNA levels were elevated in 
NB tissues and cells and restoration of CDC42 or BCL2 reversed the regulatory 
effect of miR-149 on NB progression.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that miR-149 suppressed cell proliferation and 
improved Dox chemosensitivity by regulating CDC42 and BCL2 in NB, providing a 
novel avenue for treatment of NB.
