BACKGROUND: Genetic variants in TMPRSS3 have been causally linked to autosomal 
recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (HL) at the DFNB8 and DFNB10 loci. These 
variants include both single nucleotide and copy number variations (CNVs). In 
this study, we aim to identify the genetic cause in three Chinese subjects with 
prelingual profound sensorineural HL.
METHODS: We applied targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel 
sequencing to screen 110 genes associated with nonsyndromic HL in the three 
affected subjects. CNVplex® analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were 
performed for CNV detection.
RESULTS: We identified biallelic variations in TMPRSS3 including a novel complex 
genomic rearrangement and a novel missense mutation, c.551T>C. We have mapped 
the breakpoints of the genomic rearrangement and showed that it consisted of two 
deletions and an inversion encompassing exon 3 to exon 9 of TMPRSS3.
CONCLUSION: Our study expanded the mutational spectrum of TMPRSS3 to include 
complex genomic rearrangements. It showcased the importance of an integrative 
approach to investigate CNVs and their contribution to HL.
