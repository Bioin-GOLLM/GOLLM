Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, 
occurring in the colon or rectum portion of large intestine. With marked 
antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-tumor activities, Camellia nitidissima 
Chi has been used as an effective treatment of cancer. The azoxymethane/dextran 
sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) induced CRC mice model was established and the 
prevention effect of C. nitidissima Chi extracts on the evolving of CRC was 
evaluated by examination of neoplastic lesions, histopathological inspection, 
serum biochemistry analysis, combined with nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR)-based metabolomics and correlation network analysis. C. nitidissima Chi 
extracts could significantly inhibit AOM/DSS induced CRC, relieve the colonic 
pathology of inflammation and ameliorate the serum biochemistry, and could 
significantly reverse the disturbed metabolic profiling toward the normal state. 
Moreover, the butanol fraction showed a better efficacy than the water-soluble 
fraction of C. nitidissima Chi. Further development of C. nitidissima Chi 
extracts as a potent CRC inhibitor was warranted.
