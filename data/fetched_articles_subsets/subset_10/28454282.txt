Gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers that arise due to genetic mutations affect a 
large number of individuals worldwide. Even though many of the GI tract cancers 
arise sporadically, few of these GI tract cancers harboring a hereditary 
predisposition are now recognized and well characterized. These include Cowden 
syndrome, MUTYH-associated polyposis, hereditary pancreatic cancer, Lynch 
syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), 
attenuated FAP, serrated polyposis syndrome, and hereditary gastric cancer. 
Molecular characterization of the genes that are involved in these syndromes was 
useful in the development of genetic testing for diagnosis and also facilitated 
understanding of the genetic basis of GI cancers. Current knowledge on the 
genetics of GI cancers with emphasis on heritability and germ line mutations 
forms the basis of the present review.
