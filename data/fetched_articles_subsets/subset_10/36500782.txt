A semi-automated diffusion-dialysis purification procedure is proposed for the 
preparation of uncontaminated graphene oxide (GO) aqueous dispersions. The 
purification process is integrated with analytical-signal processing to control 
the purification degree online by several channels: oxidation-reduction 
potential, conductivity, and absorbance. This approach reduces the amounts of 
reagents for chemical treatment during dialysis. The total transition metal (Mn 
and Ti) content was reduced to a sub-ppb level (assessed by slurry nebulization 
in inductively coupled plasma optical atomic emission spectroscopy). Purified 
aqueous GO samples possess good stability for about a year with a zeta-potential 
of ca. -40 mV and a lateral size of ca. sub-Âµm. Purified GO samples showed 
increased antioxidant properties (up to five times compared to initial samples 
according to chemiluminometry by superoxide-radical (O2-) generated in situ from 
xanthine and xanthine oxidase with the lucigenin probe) and significantly 
decreased peroxidase-like activity (assessed by the H2O2-L-012 system).
