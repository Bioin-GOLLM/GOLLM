Several studies have assessed the association of CD95L polymorphism with 
cervical cancer risk, but the data lack the power to provide compelling 
evidence. In this study, we aimed to clarify the association through a 
meta-analysis. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web 
of Science. The fixed-effects model was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) with 
95 % confidence intervals (CIs). A total of five papers with six case-control 
studies were derived and finally included in this meta-analysis. The overall 
estimate did not reveal any significant association between CD95L -844C/T 
polymorphism and cervical cancer risk. Subgroup analysis in Asian population 
indicated nonsignificant nevertheless potentially increased risk in CC genotype 
carriers in comparison with the carriers of CT+TT genotypes (ORCC vs. 
CT+TT=1.16, 95 % CI=0.99-1.36, P for heterogeneity=0.231). Based on current 
epidemiological studies, this meta-analysis suggests that CD95L polymorphism may 
not be a risk factor contributing to cervical cancer development.
