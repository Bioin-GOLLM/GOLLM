Mitochondrial dynamics are suggested to be indispensable for the maintenance of 
cellular quality and function in response to various stresses. While ionizing 
radiation (IR) stimulates mitochondrial fission, which is mediated by the 
mitochondrial fission protein, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), it remains 
unclear how IR promotes Drp1 activation and subsequent mitochondrial fission. 
Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate these concerns. First, we 
found that X-irradiation triggered Drp1 phosphorylation at serine 616 (S616) but 
not at serine 637 (S637). Reconstitution analysis revealed that introduction of 
wild-type (WT) Drp1 recovered radiation-induced mitochondrial fission, which was 
absent in Drp1-deficient cells. Compared with cells transfected with WT or S637A 
Drp1, the change in mitochondrial shape following irradiation was mitigated in 
S616A Drp1-transfected cells. Furthermore, inhibition of CaMKII significantly 
suppressed Drp1 S616 phosphorylation and mitochondrial fission induced by IR. 
These results suggest that Drp1 phosphorylation at S616, but not at S637, is 
prerequisite for radiation-induced mitochondrial fission and that CaMKII 
regulates Drp1 phosphorylation at S616 following irradiation.
