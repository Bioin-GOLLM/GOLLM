Isolation of skeletal muscles allows for the exploration of many complex 
diseases. Here, we present a protocol for isolating mice skeletal muscle 
myoblasts and myotubes that have been differentiated through antibody 
validation. We describe steps for collecting and preparing murine skeletal 
tissue, myoblast cell maintenance, plating, and cell differentiation. We then 
detail procedures for cell incubation, immunostaining, slide preparation and 
storage, and imaging for immunofluorescence validation.
