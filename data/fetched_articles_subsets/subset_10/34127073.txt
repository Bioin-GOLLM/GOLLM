BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis 
of Parkinson's disease (PD), and several genes linked to familial PD, including 
PINK1 (encoding PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 [PINK1]) and PARK2 (encoding the 
E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin), are directly involved in processes such as 
mitophagy that maintain mitochondrial health. The dominant p.D620N variant of 
vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (VPS35) gene is also associated with 
familial PD but has not been functionally connected to PINK1 and PARK2.
METHODS: To better mimic and study the patient situation, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to 
generate heterozygous human SH-SY5Y cells carrying the PD-associated D620N 
variant of VPS35. These cells were treated with a protonophore carbonyl cyanide 
m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to induce the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, 
which was assessed using biochemical and microscopy approaches.
RESULTS: Mitochondria in the VPS35-D620N cells exhibited reduced mitochondrial 
membrane potential and appeared to already be damaged at steady state. As a 
result, the mitochondria of these cells were desensitized to the CCCP-induced 
collapse in mitochondrial potential, as they displayed altered fragmentation and 
were unable to accumulate PINK1 at their surface upon this insult. Consequently, 
Parkin recruitment to the cell surface was inhibited and initiation of the 
PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy was impaired.
CONCLUSION: Our findings extend the pool of evidence that the p.D620N mutation 
of VPS35 causes mitochondrial dysfunction and suggest a converging pathogenic 
mechanism among VPS35, PINK1 and Parkin in PD.
