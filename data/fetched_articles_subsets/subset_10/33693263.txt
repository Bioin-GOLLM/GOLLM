Background: Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is a progressive disease with a 
poor prognosis. There had been no specific treatment for transthyretin amyloid 
cardiomyopathy until tafamidis received expanded approval in March 2019 in 
Japan. However, the clinical efficacy of tafamidis remains unknown. 
Methods and Results: We initiated tafamidis treatment in 9 patients (median age 
78 years; 89% male) from May 2019 to April 2020. Within 6 months after 
initiation, 1 patient discontinued prematurely and 2 patients were hospitalized 
due to worsening heart failure, with 1 of these patients discontinuing therapy. 
There were no significant changes in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide and serum 
troponin I concentrations over the 6-month treatment period, but 
interventricular septum thickness increased in 3 of 6 patients. Conclusions: 
Further evaluation of tafamidis therapy in a larger patient cohort with 
transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is warranted to determine the optimal 
therapeutic strategy.
