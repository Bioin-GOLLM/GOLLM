Spectrins are multi-domain, elastic proteins that provide elasticity to the 
plasma membrane of erythrocytes and select nucleated cells. Spectrins have also 
been found in the nucleus of non-erythrocytes, but their function remains to be 
uncovered. It has been hypothesized that a spring-like spectrin network exists 
within the lamina nucleoskeleton, however, experiments testing a spectrin 
network׳s mechanical impact on the nucleus are lacking. Here, we knock-down 
levels of nuclear αII-spectrin with the goal of disrupting this nucleoskeletal 
spectrin network. We mechanically test live cells with intranuclear particle 
tracking and compression assays to probe changes in nuclear mechanics with 
decreases in αII-spectrin. We show no changes in chromatin mechanics or in the 
stiffness of nuclei under compression. However, we do observe a reduction in the 
ability of nuclei with decreased αII-spectrin to recover after compression. 
These results establish spectrin as a nucleoskeletal component that specifically 
contributes to elastic recovery after compression.
