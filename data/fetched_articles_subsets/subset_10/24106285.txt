CONTEXT: Although numerous epidemiologic studies have documented associations 
between osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, the mechanisms underlying this 
association remain to be clarified. One hypothesis is that hyperlipidemia may be 
a common predisposing factor to both atherosclerotic heart disease and bone 
fragility.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate this, we compared bone mineral density (BMD) between 
subjects with and without the R3500Q APOB mutation, the cause of familial 
defective apolipoprotein B-100, which has been previously shown to markedly 
increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We hypothesized that 
R3500Q carriers would have lower BMD due to lifetime, elevated LDL-C.
DESIGN: This was a a cross-sectional study in the Old Order Amish (OOA) 
population.
PARTICIPANTS: The R3500Q APOB mutation is present at a high frequency (âˆ¼6% vs 
<0.5%) in the OOA population due to a founder effect. Therefore, we conducted 
analysis on 1097 Amish individuals of whom 125 were R3500Q carriers.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.
RESULTS: After adjusting for age, age(2), sex, body mass index, and family 
structure, carriers for the Q risk allele had significantly lower BMD than 
noncarriers at the femoral neck (P = .037), lumbar spine (P = .035) and whole 
body (P = .016). Adjusting for LDL-C attenuated the association between R3500Q 
genotype and BMD but did not completely explain the relationship. Subgroup 
analyses showed no significant interactions with sex, age, or presence of 
metabolic syndrome.
CONCLUSION: These results use the unique genetic architecture of the OOA 
population to provide a novel line of evidence supporting a causal role for 
elevated LDL-C in lowering BMD.
