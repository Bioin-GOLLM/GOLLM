Malignant gliomas are among the most devastating tumors for which conventional 
therapies have not significantly improved patient outcome. Despite advances in 
imaging, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, survival is still less than 2 
years from diagnosis and more targeted therapies are urgently needed. Notch 
signaling is central to the normal and neoplastic development of the central 
nervous system, playing important roles in proliferation, differentiation, 
apoptosis and cancer stem cell regulation. Notch is also involved in the 
regulation response to hypoxia and angiogenesis, which are typical tumor and 
more specifically glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) features. Targeting Notch 
signaling is therefore a promising strategy for developing future therapies for 
the treatment of GBM. In this review we give an overview of the mechanisms of 
Notch signaling, its networking pathways in gliomas, and discuss its potential 
for designing novel therapeutic approaches.
