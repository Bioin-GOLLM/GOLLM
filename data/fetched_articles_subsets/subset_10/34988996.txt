Here, we delineate the phenotype of two siblings with a bi-allelic frameshift 
variant in MMP15 gene with congenital cardiac defects, cholestasis, and 
dysmorphism. Genome sequencing analysis revealed a recently reported homozygous 
frameshift variant (c.1058delC, p.Pro353Glnfs*102) in MMP15 gene that 
co-segregates with the phenotype in the family in a recessive mode of 
inheritance. Relative quantification of MMP15 mRNA showed evidence of 
degradation of the mutated transcript, presumably by nonsense mediated decay. 
Likewise, MMP15: p.Gly231Arg, a concurrently reported homozygous missense 
variant in another patient exhibiting a similar phenotype, was predicted to 
disrupt zinc ion binding to the MMP-15 enzyme catalytic domain, which is 
essential for substrate proteolysis, by structural modeling. Previous animal 
models and cellular findings suggested that MMP15 plays a crucial role in the 
formation of endocardial cushions. These findings confirm that MMP15 is an 
important gene in human development, particularly cardiac, and that its loss of 
function is likely to cause a severe disorder phenotype.
