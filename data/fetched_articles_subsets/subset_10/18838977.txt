OBJECTIVE: Polymorphisms in the obesity-associated gene, FTO, have been linked 
with sensitivity to satiety in children, indicating FTO may be influencing one 
of the regulatory drivers underlying food intake. In this study, we tested the 
hypothesis that food intake in a standard eating behaviour paradigm in which 
palatable food is offered under conditions of satiety would be associated with 
FTO genotype status, after controlling for differences in body mass index (BMI).
METHODS: Participants were 131 children aged 4-5 years, taking part in a 
behavioural study of food intake for whom DNA was available for genotyping. The 
phenotypic indicator of intake was the child's consumption of palatable food 
presented after having eaten a meal. We also assessed physical activity using 
parental reports of the child's enjoyment of active games, their level of 
activity relative to other children and a standard measure of fidgetiness. 
Associations between polymorphisms of the intronic FTO single nucleotide 
polymorphism (rs9939609) and behaviour (food intake and activity) were assessed 
by analysis of variance controlling for sex, age and BMI s.d. scores.
RESULTS: The distribution of AA (homogenous for A allele), AT (heterogeneous T 
and A alleles) and TT (homogenous for T allele) genotypes was 18, 50 and 32%, 
respectively. As predicted, TT homozygotes ate significantly less than 
heterozygotes (P=0.03) or AA homozygotes (P=0.02). The effect was not diminished 
by controlling for BMI s.d. scores. There were no significant associations 
between FTO genotype and any marker of physical activity.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that children with two copies of the lower-risk FTO 
alleles ate less than those with one or two higher-risk alleles. We conclude 
that the T allele is protective against overeating by promoting responsiveness 
to internal signals of satiety.
