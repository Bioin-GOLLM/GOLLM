The authors report 2 male patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) in a 
Japanese kindred. Sequencing of the complementary DNA of the dyskerin gene 
(DKC1) revealed a T-to-C transition at nucleotide 1285 in exon 12 that resulted 
in a novel missense mutation L398P. Despite harboring the same mutation in the 
DKC1 gene, one patient had significantly milder hematological symptoms than the 
other, indicating that there may be other factors that determine the severity of 
DC.
