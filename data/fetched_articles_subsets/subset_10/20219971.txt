F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase is a key enzyme of oxidative phosphorylation that is 
localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria. It uses the energy stored in 
the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane to catalyze the 
synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate. Dimeric and higher oligomeric forms of 
ATP synthase have been observed in mitochondria from various organisms. 
Oligomerization of ATP synthase is critical for the morphology of the inner 
mitochondrial membrane because it supports the generation of tubular cristae 
membrane domains. Association of individual F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase complexes is 
mediated by the membrane-embedded F(o)-part. Several subunits were mapped to 
monomer-monomer-interfaces of yeast ATP synthase complexes, but only Su e 
(Atp21) and Su g (Atp20) have so far been identified as crucial for the 
formation of stable dimers. We show that two other small F(o)-components, Su k 
(Atp19) and Su i (Atp18) are involved in the stepwise assembly of F(1)F(o)-ATP 
synthase dimers and oligomers. We have identified an intermediate form of the 
ATP synthase dimer, which accumulates in the absence of Su i. Moreover, our data 
indicate that Su i facilitates the incorporation of newly synthesized subunits 
into ATP synthase complexes.
