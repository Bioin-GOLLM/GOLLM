AIM: To explore the frequency of polymorphisms in adrenergic cardiovascular 
control genes in adolescent with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and the relation 
of such polymorphisms to cardiovascular variables.
METHODS: DNA from 53 patients with CFS, 12-18 years old, was analysed for five 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes catechol-O-methyltransferase 
(COMT), the β₂ -adrenergic receptor (two SNPs), the β₁ -adrenergic receptor and 
the α₂(a) -adrenergic receptor. Frequencies were compared to a reference 
population constructed from the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(NCBI) database, and associations between frequencies and autonomic 
cardiovascular responses during a 20° head-up tilt-test were explored.
RESULTS: For the COMT SNP Rs4680, patients with CFS had a higher frequency of 
the AA genotype and a lower frequency of the G containing genotypes (AG and GG), 
when compared to the reference sample (p = 0.046). Also, the AA genotype was 
associated with a smaller increase in LF/HF ratio (low-frequency:high-frequency 
heart rate variability ratio, an index of cardiac sympathovagal balance) during 
head-up tilt when compared to the AG/GG genotypes. For the β₂ -adrenergic 
receptor SNP Rs1042714, patients with CFS had a lower frequency of the GG 
genotype and a higher frequency of the genotypes containing C (CG and CC) (p = 
0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: CFS might be related to polymorphisms of COMT and the β₂ 
-adrenergic receptor. More details of the molecular mechanisms remain to be 
investigated.
