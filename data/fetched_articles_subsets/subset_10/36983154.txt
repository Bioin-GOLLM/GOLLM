The 11 β- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11 β-HSD1) is hypothesized to play a 
role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its related complications. 
Because high glucocorticoid levels are a risk factor for metabolic disorders, 
11β-HSD1 might be a viable therapeutic target. In this investigation, docking 
experiments were performed on the main constituents of Spondias mangifera (SM) 
oleanolic acid, β-amyrin, and β-sitosterol to ascertain their affinity and 
binding interaction in the human 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 enzyme's 
active region. The results of in vitro 11β HSD1 inhibitory assay demonstrated 
that the extract of S. mangifera had a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the 
11-HSD1% inhibition (63.97%) in comparison to STZ (31.79%). Additionally, a 
non-insulin-dependent diabetic mice model was used to examine the sub-acute 
anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-diabetic effects of SM fruits. Results revealed 
that, in comparison to the diabetic control group, SM fruit extract (SMFE) 
extract at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight considerably (p < 0.05 and p < 
0.01) lowered blood glucose levels at 21 and 28 days, as well as significantly 
decreased total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) and enhanced the levels 
of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). After 120 and 180 s of receiving 200 and 400 
mg/kg SMFE, respectively, disease control mice showed significantly poorer blood 
glucose tolerance (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). SMFE extract 200 (p < 0.05), SMFE 
extract 400 (p < 0.01), and Glibenclamide at a dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight all 
resulted in statistically significant weight increase (p < 0.01) when compared 
to the diabetic control group after 28 days of treatment. According to in 
silico, in vitro, and in vivo validation, SMFE is a prospective medication with 
anti-diabetic and hypoglycemic effects.
