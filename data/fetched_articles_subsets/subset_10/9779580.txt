A protein-engineered beta-lactamase, constructed by site-directed mutagenesis in 
Escherichia coli (E104M/G238S), and having broadened specificity, was able to 
degrade cephalosporins of first, second, and third generations. Manipulations of 
culture conditions allowed an increase in beta-lactamase specific activity by up 
to twofold. The resultant bacteria were used to construct an immersable 
whole-cell biosensor for the detection of new-generation cephalosporins. Cells 
were immobilized on agar membranes, which in turn were attached to the surface 
of a flat pH electrode, thus constituting a biosensor based on the detection of 
pH changes. The sensor was able to detect second- and third-generation 
cephalosporins: cefamandole (0.4-4 mM), cefotaxime (0.4-3.5 mM), and 
cefoperazone (0.3-1.85 mM). Response times were between 3.5 and 11 min, 
depending on the kind of cephalosporin tested. The biosensor was stable for at 
least 7 d, time during which up to 100 tests were performed.
