New neurons appear only in a few regions of the adult mammalian brain and become 
integrated into existing circuits. Little is known about the functional 
development of individual neurons in vivo. We examined the functional life 
history of adult-born granule cells (abGCs) in the olfactory bulb using 
multiphoton imaging in awake and anesthetized mice. We found that abGCs can 
become responsive to odorants soon after they arrive in the olfactory bulb. 
Tracking identified abGCs over weeks revealed that the robust and broadly tuned 
responses of most newly arrived abGCs gradually become more selective over a 
period of ∼3 weeks, but a small fraction achieves broader tuning with 
maturation. Enriching the olfactory environment of mice prolonged the period 
over which abGCs were strongly and broadly responsive to odorants. Our data 
offer direct support for rapid integration of adult-born neurons into existing 
circuits, followed by experience-dependent refinement of their functional 
connectivity.
