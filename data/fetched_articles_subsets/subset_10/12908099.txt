Twin and family studies had shown that genetic factors are important 
determinants of bone mass. Multiple genes might be involved. One candidate gene, 
the reversion-induced LIM gene ( RIL), is a PDZ and LIM-domain-containing 
protein and has been localized within the cytokine cluster of chromosome 5 
(5q31.1). In a genetic study of 370 adult Japanese women, we investigated the 
correlation between radial bone mineral density (BMD) and a genetic variation 
(-3333T-->C) of the 5'-flanking region of RIL gene. A significant association 
was identified between the RIL variation -3333T-->C and radial BMD ( r=0.15, 
P=0.003). The variation of the RIL locus may be an important determinant of 
osteoporosis.
