Microsatellite instability (MSI) leads to accumulation of an excessive number of 
mutations in the genome, mostly small insertions and deletions. MSI colorectal 
cancers (CRCs), however, also contain more point mutations than 
microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors, yet they have not been as comprehensively 
studied. To identify candidate driver genes affected by point mutations in MSI 
CRC, we ranked genes based on mutation significance while correcting for 
replication timing and gene expression utilizing an algorithm, MutSigCV Somatic 
point mutation data from the exome kit-targeted area from 24 exome-sequenced 
sporadic MSI CRCs and respective normals, and 12 whole-genome-sequenced sporadic 
MSI CRCs and respective normals were utilized. The top 73 genes were 
validated in 93 additional MSI CRCs. The MutSigCV ranking identified several 
well-established MSI CRC driver genes and provided additional evidence for 
previously proposed CRC candidate genes as well as shortlisted genes that have 
to our knowledge not been linked to CRC before. Two genes, SMARCB1 and STK38L, 
were also functionally scrutinized, providing evidence of a tumorigenic role, 
for SMARCB1 mutations in particular.
