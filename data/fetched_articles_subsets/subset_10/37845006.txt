Despite advances in precision oncology, cancer remains a global public health 
issue. In this report, proof-of-principle evidence is presented that a 
cell-penetrable peptide (ACP52C) dissociates transcription factor CP2c complexes 
and induces apoptosis in most CP2c oncogene-addicted cancer cells through 
transcription activity-independent mechanisms. CP2cs dissociated from complexes 
directly interact with and degrade YY1, leading to apoptosis via the MDM2-p53 
pathway. The liberated CP2cs also inhibit TDP2, causing intrinsic genome-wide 
DNA strand breaks and subsequent catastrophic DNA damage responses. These two 
mechanisms are independent of cancer driver mutations but are hindered by high 
MDM2 p60 expression. However, resistance to ACP52C mediated by MDM2 p60 can be 
sensitized by CASP2 inhibition. Additionally, derivatives of ACP52C conjugated 
with fatty acid alone or with a CASP2 inhibiting peptide show improved 
pharmacokinetics and reduced cancer burden, even in ACP52C-resistant cancers. 
This study enhances the understanding of ACP52C-induced cancer-specific 
apoptosis induction and supports the use of ACP52C in anticancer drug 
development.
