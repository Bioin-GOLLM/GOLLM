BACKGROUND: Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) is a DNA damage 
recognition protein that plays an important role in nucleotide excision repair 
and can reduce oxidative stress, which may be involved in the development of 
preeclampsia (PE). Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore whether XPC 
polymorphisms were relevant to the genetic susceptibility to PE in Chinese Han 
women.
METHOD: A total of 1276 healthy pregnant women were included as the control 
group and 958 pregnant women with PE as the case group. DNA was extracted from 
peripheral blood samples to perform genotyping of loci rs2228001 and rs2228000 
in XPC through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 
relationship between XPC and susceptibility to PE was evaluated by comparing the 
genotypic and allelic frequencies between the two groups of pregnant women.
RESULTS: Polymorphism of rs2228000 may be associated with PE risk and allele T 
may play a protective role (genotype, χ2 = 38.961, P < 0.001 and allele 
χ2 = 21.746 P < 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 0.885, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 0.840-0.932). No significant difference was found between the two groups 
in rs2228001,(genotype χ2 = 3.148, P = 0.207 and allele χ2 = 0.59, P = 0.442, 
OR = 1.017, 95% CI = 0.974-1.062). When the frequencies of genotypes and alleles 
for early- and late-onset PE, mild PE and severe PE were compared with those of 
controls, the results were consistent with the large clinical sample.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the genetic variant rs2228000 in XPC may be 
associated with PE risk in Chinese Han women, and that pregnant women with the 
TT genotype have a reduced risk of PE. Further investigations are needed to 
confirm these findings in other regions or larger prospective populations.
