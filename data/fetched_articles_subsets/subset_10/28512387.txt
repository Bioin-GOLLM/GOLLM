Hepatocellular carcinoma is highly refractory cancer which is resistant to 
conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, carrying a dismal prognosis. 
Although many anticancer drugs have been developed for treating HCC, sorafenib 
is the only effective treatment, but it only prolongs survival duration for 
about 3 months. Recently, oncolytic virotherapy has shown promising results in 
treating HCCs and the effects can be more enhanced by adopting immune modulatory 
molecules. This review discusses the current status of treating HCC and the 
effective strategy of oncolytic virus-based immunotherapy for the treatment of 
HCCs.
