In systems biology, material balances, kinetic models, and thermodynamic 
boundary conditions are increasingly used for metabolic network analysis. It is 
remarkable that the reversibility of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and the 
influence of cytosolic conditions are often neglected in kinetic models. In 
fact, enzyme-catalyzed reactions in numerous metabolic pathways such as in 
glycolysis are often reversible, i.e., they only proceed until an equilibrium 
state is reached and not until the substrate is completely consumed. Here, we 
propose the use of irreversible thermodynamics to describe the kinetic 
approximation to the equilibrium state in a consistent way with very few 
adjustable parameters. Using a flux-force approach allowed describing the 
influence of cytosolic conditions on the kinetics by only one single parameter. 
The approach was applied to reaction steps 2 and 9 of glycolysis (i.e., the 
phosphoglucose isomerase reaction from glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 
6-phosphate and the enolase-catalyzed reaction from 2-phosphoglycerate to 
phosphoenolpyruvate and water). The temperature dependence of the kinetic 
parameter fulfills the Arrhenius relation and the derived activation energies 
are plausible. All the data obtained in this work were measured efficiently and 
accurately by means of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The combination 
of calorimetric monitoring with simple flux-force relations has the potential 
for adequate consideration of cytosolic conditions in a simple manner.
