Dihydroorotase (DHOase) is the third enzyme in the de novo biosynthesis pathway 
for pyrimidine nucleotides, and an attractive target for potential anticancer 
chemotherapy. By screening plant extracts and performing GC-MS analysis, we 
identified and characterized that the potent anticancer drug plumbagin (PLU), 
isolated from the carnivorous plant Nepenthes miranda, was a competitive 
inhibitor of DHOase. We also solved the complexed crystal structure of yeast 
DHOase with PLU (PDB entry 7CA1), to determine the binding interactions and 
investigate the binding modes. Mutational and structural analyses indicated the 
binding of PLU to DHOase through loop-in mode, and this dynamic loop may serve 
as a drug target. PLU exhibited cytotoxicity on the survival, migration, and 
proliferation of 4T1 cells and induced apoptosis. These results provide 
structural insights that may facilitate the development of new inhibitors 
targeting DHOase, for further clinical anticancer chemotherapies.
