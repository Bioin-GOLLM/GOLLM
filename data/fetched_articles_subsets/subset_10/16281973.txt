Sex determination is the process deciding the sex of a developing embryo. This 
is usually determined genetically; however it is a delicate process, which in 
many cases can be influenced by environmental factors. The mechanisms 
controlling zebrafish sex determination and differentiation are not known. To 
date no sex linked genes have been identified in zebrafish and no sex 
chromosomes have been identified. However, a number of genes, as presented here, 
have been linked to the process of sex determination or differentiation in 
zebrafish. The zebrafish FTZ-F1 genes are of central interest as they are 
involved in regulating interrenal development and thereby steroid biosynthesis, 
as well as that they show expression patterns congruent with reproductive tissue 
differentiation and function. Zebrafish can be sex reversed by exposure to 
estrogens, suggesting that the estrogen levels are crucial during sex 
differentiation. The Cyp19 gene product aromatase converts testosterone into 17 
beta-estradiol, and when inhibited leads to male to female sex reversal. FTZ-F1 
genes are strongly linked to steroid biosynthesis and the regulatory region of 
Cyp19 contains binding sites for FTZ-F1 genes, further linking FTZ-F1 to this 
process. The role of FTZ-F1 and other candidates for zebrafish sex determination 
and differentiation is in focus of this review.
