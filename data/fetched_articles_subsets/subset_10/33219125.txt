INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) represents the main cause of enterically 
transmitted hepatitis worldwide. It is known that neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) is 
one of the most frequent neurological manifestations of HEV. However, clinical, 
electrodiagnostic (EDX) and MRI characteristics, as well as long-term follow-up 
of HEV-related NA have not been fully described yet.
CASE REPORTS: We describe longitudinally clinical, EDX, biological and MRI 
results of six cases of HEV-associated NA, diagnosed from 2012 to 2017. Patients 
were between the ages of 33 and 57 years old and had a positive HEV serology. 
Clinical patterns showed the whole spectrum of NA, varying from extensive 
multiple mononeuropathy damage to single mononeuropathy. EDX results showed that 
the patients totalised 26 inflammatory mononeuropathies (1 to 8 per patient). 
These involved classical nerves such as suprascapular (6/6 cases), long thoracic 
(5/6 cases) and accessory spinal nerves (2/6 cases) and, some less frequent more 
distal nerves like anterior interosseous nerve (3/6 cases), as well as some 
unusual ones such as the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (1/6 case), 
sensory fibres of median nerve (1/6 case) and phrenic nerves (1/6 case). After 2 
to 8 years, all nerves had clinically recovered (muscle examination above 3/5 on 
MRC scale for all muscles except in one patient).
DISCUSSION: HEV should be systematically screened when NA is suspected, whatever 
the severity, if the onset is less than 4 months (before IgM HEV-antibodies 
disappear) and appears to be frequently associated with severe clinical and EDX 
pattern, without increasing the usual recovery time.
