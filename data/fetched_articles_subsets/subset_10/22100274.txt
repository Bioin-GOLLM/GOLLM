Polo family kinases play important roles in cellular proliferation as well as 
neuronal synaptic plasticity. However, the posttranslational regulation of these 
kinases is not fully understood. Here, we identified several novel Plk2 
phosphorylation sites stimulated by Plk2 itself. By site-directed mutagenesis, 
we uncovered three additional hyperactivating Plk2 mutations as well as a series 
of residues regulating Plk2 steady-state expression level. Because of the 
established role of Plk2 in homeostatic negative control of excitatory synaptic 
strength, these phosphorylation sites could play an important role in the rapid 
activation, expansion, and prolongation of Plk2 signaling in this process.
