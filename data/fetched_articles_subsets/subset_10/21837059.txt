The complete mol-ecule in the title compound, C(22)H(20)N(2)O(4), is generated 
by the application of an inversion centre. With the exception of the terminal 
acetyl-ene groups [C-O-C-C = -78.02 (17)°], the remaining atoms constituting the 
mol-ecule are essentially coplanar. The configuration around the C=N bond 
[1.282 (2) Å] is E. The formation of supra-molecular chains mediated by C-H⋯O 
inter-actions, occurring between methyl-ene H and meth-oxy O atoms, is the most 
notable feature of the crystal packing.
