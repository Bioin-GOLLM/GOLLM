BACKGROUND: Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP), resulting from the inhalation of 
silica-containing coal mine dust, is characterized by fibrosing nodular lesions 
that eventually develop into progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, it has 
been hypothesized that inflammasomes could have a crucial role in the host 
response to silica and recent studies show that the inflammasome contributes to 
inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. NLRP3, CARD8 are components of the NLRP3 
inflammasome, which triggers caspase 1-mediated IL-1β and IL-18 release. In the 
present study, we investigated whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in inflammasome genes are associated with CWP.
METHODS: We performed an association study analyzing 3 NLRP3, 1 CARD8, 1 IL-1β, 
2 IL-18 SNPs in a case-control study of 697 CWP and 694 controls. Genotyping was 
carried out by the TaqMan method.
RESULTS: The NLRP3 rs1539019 TT genotype was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of CWP (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.39, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 1.07-1.81), compared with the GG/GT genotype, in particular among smokers 
(adjusted OR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.15-2.42). In addition, the polymorphism was 
significantly associated with risk of CWP patients with stage I.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing an association between the NLRP3 
rs1539019 polymorphism and CWP, and suggests that this polymorphism may confer 
increased risk for the development of the disease. Further studies are warranted 
to confirm our findings.
