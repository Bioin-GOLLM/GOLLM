A significant correlation has been shown between the binding antibody responses 
against original severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
spike protein and vaccine efficacy of 4 approved coronavirus disease 2019 
vaccines. We therefore assessed the immune response against original SARS-CoV-2 
elicited by the adjuvanted S-Trimer vaccine, SCB-2019 + CpG/alum, in the same 
assay and laboratory. Responses to SCB-2019 were comparable or superior for 
antibody to original and Alpha variant when compared with 4 approved vaccines. 
The comparison accurately predicted success of the recently reported efficacy 
trial of SCB-2019 vaccine. Immunogenicity comparisons to original strain and 
variants of concern should be considered as a basis for authorization of 
vaccines.
