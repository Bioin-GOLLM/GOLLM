PURPOSE: Thymidine-dependent small-colony variants (TD-SCVs) are difficult to 
detect or test for antimicrobial susceptibility. We investigated the 
characteristics of clonal TD-SCVs of Escherichia coli, both with and without 
blaCTX-M-3, isolated from a patient.
METHODOLOGY: Mutation in the thyA gene was analysed by sequencing, and 
morphological abnormalities in the colonies and cells of the isolates were 
examined. Additionally, conjugational transfer experiments were performed to 
prove the horizontal transferability of plasmids harbouring resistance genes.
RESULTS: The TD-SCVs contained a single nucleotide substitution in the thyA 
gene, c.62G>A, corresponding to p.Arg21His. Morphologically, their colonies were 
more translucent and flattened than those of the wild-type strain. In addition, 
cells of the TD-SCVs were swollen and elongated, sometimes with abnormal and 
incomplete divisions; a large amount of cell debris was also observed. Changing 
c.62G>A back to the wild-type sequence reversed these abnormalities. 
Conjugational transfer experiments showed that the TD-SCV of E. coli with 
blaCTX-M-3 failed to transfer blaCTX-M-3 to E. coli CSH2. However, the TD-SCV of 
E. coli without blaCTX-M-3 experimentally received the plasmid encoding 
blaSHV-18 from Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and transferred it to E. coli 
CSH2.
CONCLUSION: Mutation in the thyA gene causes morphological abnormalities in the 
colonies and cells of E. coli, as well as inducing thymidine auxotrophy. In 
addition, TD-SCVs horizontally transmit plasmids encoding resistance genes. It 
is important to detect TD-SCVs based on their characteristics because they serve 
as reservoirs of transferable antibiotic resistance plasmids.
