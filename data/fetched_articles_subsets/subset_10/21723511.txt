Tumor cells have an altered metabolic phenotype characterized by increased 
glycolysis and diminished oxidative phosphorylation. Despite the suspected 
importance of glycolysis in tumorigenesis, the temporal relationship between 
oncogene signaling, in vivo tumor formation, and glycolytic pathway activity is 
poorly understood. Moreover, how glycolytic pathways are altered as tumors 
regress remains unknown. Here, we use a switchable model of Myc-driven liver 
cancer, along with hyperpolarized (13)C-pyruvate magnetic resonance 
spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to visualize glycolysis in de novo tumor formation 
and regression. LDHA abundance and activity in tumors is tightly correlated 
to in vivo pyruvate conversion to lactate and is rapidly inhibited as tumors 
begin to regress, as are numerous glycolysis pathway genes. Conversion of 
pyruvate to alanine predominates in precancerous tissues prior to observable 
morphologic or histological changes. These results demonstrate that metabolic 
changes precede tumor formation and regression and are directly linked to the 
activity of a single oncogene.
