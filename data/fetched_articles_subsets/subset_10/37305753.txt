BACKGROUND: Patients with comorbid schizophrenia, depression, drug use, and 
multiple psychiatric diagnoses have a greater risk of carotid revascularization 
following stroke. The gut microbiome (GM) plays a crucial role in the attack of 
mental illness and IS, which may become an index for the diagnosis of IS. A 
genomic study of the genetic commonalities between SC and IS, as well as its 
mediated pathways and immune infiltration, will be conducted to determine how 
schizophrenia contributes to the high prevalence of IS. According to our study, 
this could be an indicator of ischemic stroke development.
METHODS: We selected two datasets of IS from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), 
one for training and the other for the verification group. Five genes related to 
mental disorders and GM were extracted from Gene cards and other databases. 
Linear models for microarray data (Limma) analysis was utilized to identify 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and perform functional enrichment 
analysis. It was also used to conduct machine learning exercises such as random 
forest and regression to identify the best candidate for immune-related central 
genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and artificial neural network 
(ANN) were established for verification. The receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve was drawn for the diagnosis of IS, and the diagnostic model was 
verified by qRT-PCR. Further immune cell infiltration analysis was performed to 
study the IS immune cell imbalance. We also performed consensus clustering (CC) 
to analyze the expression of candidate models under different subtypes. Finally, 
miRNA, transcription factors (TFs), and drugs related to candidate genes were 
collected through the Network analyst online platform.
RESULTS: Through comprehensive analysis, a diagnostic prediction model with good 
effect was obtained. Both the training group (AUC 0.82, CI 0.93-0.71) and the 
verification group (AUC 0.81, CI 0.90-0.72) had a good phenotype in the qRT-PCR 
test. And in verification group 2 we validated between the two groups with and 
without carotid-related ischemic cerebrovascular events (AUC 0.87, CI 1-0.64). 
Furthermore, we investigated cytokines in both GSEA and immune infiltration and 
verified cytokine-related responses by flow cytometry, particularly IL-6, which 
played an important role in IS occurrence and progression. Therefore, we 
speculate that mental illness may affect the development of IS in B cells and 
IL-6 in T cells. MiRNA (hsa-mir-129-2-3p, has-mir-335-5p, and has-mir-16-5p) and 
TFs (CREB1, FOXL1), which may be related to IS, were obtained.
CONCLUSION: Through comprehensive analysis, a diagnostic prediction model with 
good effect was obtained. Both the training group (AUC 0.82, CI 0.93-0.71) and 
the verification group (AUC 0.81, CI 0.90-0.72) had a good phenotype in the 
qRT-PCR test. And in verification group 2 we validated between the two groups 
with and without carotid-related ischemic cerebrovascular events (AUC 0.87, CI 
1-0.64). MiRNA (hsa-mir-129-2-3p, has-mir-335-5p, and has-mir-16-5p) and TFs 
(CREB1, FOXL1), which may be related to IS, were obtained.
