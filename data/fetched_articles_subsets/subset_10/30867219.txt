PURPOSE: For many tumors, signaling exchanges between cancer cells and other 
cells in their microenvironment influence overall tumor signaling. Some of these 
exchanges depend on expression of the primary cilium on nontransformed cell 
populations, as extracellular ligands including Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), PDGFRα, 
and others function through receptors spatially localized to cilia. Cell 
ciliation is regulated by proteins that are themselves therapeutic targets. We 
investigated whether kinase inhibitors of clinical interest influence ciliation 
and signaling by proteins with ciliary receptors in cancer and other 
cilia-relevant disorders, such as polycystic kidney disease (PKD).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We screened a library of clinical and preclinical kinase 
inhibitors, identifying drugs that either prevented or induced ciliary 
disassembly. Specific bioactive protein targets of the drugs were identified by 
mRNA depletion. Mechanism of action was defined, and activity of select 
compounds investigated.
RESULTS: We identified multiple kinase inhibitors not previously linked to 
control of ciliation, including sunitinib, erlotinib, and an inhibitor of the 
innate immune pathway kinase, IRAK4. For all compounds, activity was mediated 
through regulation of Aurora-A (AURKA) activity. Drugs targeting cilia 
influenced proximal cellular responses to SHH and PDGFRα. In vivo, sunitinib 
durably limited ciliation and cilia-related biological activities in renal 
cells, renal carcinoma cells, and PKD cysts. Extended analysis of IRAK4 defined 
a subset of innate immune signaling effectors potently affecting ciliation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a paradigm by which targeted drugs may have 
unexpected off-target effects in heterogeneous cell populations in vivo via 
control of a physical platform for receipt of extracellular ligands.
