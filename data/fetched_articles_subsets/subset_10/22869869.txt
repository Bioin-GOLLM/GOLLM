PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown that the replication checkpoint, which 
involves the kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3 related (ATR) and 
Chk1, contributes to cytarabine resistance in cell lines. In the present study, 
we examined whether this checkpoint is activated in clinical acute myelogenous 
leukemia (AML) during cytarabine infusion in vivo and then assessed the impact 
of combining cytarabine with the recently described Chk1 inhibitor SCH 900776 in 
vitro.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: AML marrow aspirates harvested before and during cytarabine 
infusion were examined by immunoblotting. Human AML lines treated with 
cytarabine in the absence or presence of SCH 900776 were assayed for checkpoint 
activation by immunoblotting, nucleotide incorporation into DNA, and flow 
cytometry. Long-term effects in AML lines, clinical AML isolates, and normal 
myeloid progenitors were assayed using clonogenic assays.
RESULTS: Immunoblotting revealed increased Chk1 phosphorylation, a marker of 
checkpoint activation, in more than half of Chk1-containing AMLs after 48 hours 
of cytarabine infusion. In human AML lines, SCH 900776 not only disrupted 
cytarabine-induced Chk1 activation and S-phase arrest but also markedly 
increased cytarabine-induced apoptosis. Clonogenic assays demonstrated that SCH 
900776 enhanced the antiproliferative effects of cytarabine in AML cell lines 
and clinical AML samples at concentrations that had negligible impact on normal 
myeloid progenitors.
CONCLUSIONS: These results not only provide evidence for cytarabine-induced 
S-phase checkpoint activation in AML in the clinical setting, but also show that 
a selective Chk1 inhibitor can overcome the S-phase checkpoint and enhance the 
cytotoxicity of cytarabine. Accordingly, further investigation of the 
cytarabine/SCH 900776 combination in AML appears warranted.
