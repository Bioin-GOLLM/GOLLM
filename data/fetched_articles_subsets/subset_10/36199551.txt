OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore the mechanism of the Zhilong 
Huoxue Tongyu (ZL) capsule in the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) 
via targeting ferroptosis based on network pharmacology.
METHODS: The active ingredients and related key targets of the ZL capsule were 
screened using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database 
and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were also 
performed. Finally, identified targets were validated in an in-vivo model of 
ICH.
RESULTS: A total of 30 active ingredients and 33 intersecting targets were 
identified through a TCMSP database search. Ingredients-Targets-Pathways network 
was constructed to filter out the key targets according to the degree value. 
TP53 was selected as the key target. The in-vivo validation studies demonstrated 
that TP53 was down-regulated and GPX4 was upregulated in rats following ZL 
capsule treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the ZL capsule could alleviate ICH in a 
muti-target and multi-pathway manner. ZL capsule could alleviate ICH by 
inhibiting ferroptosis, and TP53 is identified to be the potential target. 
Further research is needed to clarify the detailed anti-ferroptotic mechanism of 
the ZL capsule.
