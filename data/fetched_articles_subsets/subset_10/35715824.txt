BACKGROUND: hPSC-derived endothelial and hematopoietic cells (ECs and HCs) are 
an interesting source of cells for tissue engineering. Despite their close 
spatial and temporal embryonic development, current hPSC differentiation 
protocols are specialized in only one of these lineages. In this study, we 
generated a hematoendothelial population that could be further differentiated in 
vitro to both lineages.
METHODS: Two hESCs and one hiPSC lines were differentiated into a 
hematoendothelial population, hPSC-ECs and blast colonies (hPSC-BCs) via 
CD144+-embryoid bodies (hPSC-EBs). hPSC-ECs were characterized by endothelial 
colony-forming assay, LDL uptake assay, endothelial activation by TNF-α, nitric 
oxide detection and Matrigel-based tube formation. Hematopoietic colony-forming 
cell assay was performed from hPSC-BCs. Interestingly, we identified a hPSC-BC 
population characterized by the expression of both CD144 and CD45. hPSC-ECs and 
hPSC-BCs were analyzed by flow cytometry and RT-qPCR; in vivo experiments have 
been realized by ischemic tissue injury model on a mouse dorsal skinfold chamber 
and hematopoietic reconstitution in irradiated immunosuppressed mouse from 
hPSC-ECs and hPSC-EB-CD144+, respectively. Transcriptomic analyses were 
performed to confirm the endothelial and hematopoietic identity of hESC-derived 
cell populations by comparing them against undifferentiated hESC, among each 
other's (e.g. hPSC-ECs vs. hPSC-EB-CD144+) and against human embryonic liver 
(EL) endothelial, hematoendothelial and hematopoietic cell subpopulations.
RESULTS: A hematoendothelial population was obtained after 84 h of hPSC-EBs 
formation under serum-free conditions and isolated based on CD144 expression. 
Intrafemorally injection of hPSC-EB-CD144+ contributed to the generation of 
CD45+ human cells in immunodeficient mice suggesting the existence of hemogenic 
ECs within hPSC-EB-CD144+. Endothelial differentiation of hPSC-EB-CD144+ yields 
a population of > 95% functional ECs in vitro. hPSC-ECs derived through this 
protocol participated at the formation of new vessels in vivo in a mouse 
ischemia model. In vitro, hematopoietic differentiation of hPSC-EB-CD144+ 
generated an intermediate population of > 90% CD43+ hPSC-BCs capable to generate 
myeloid and erythroid colonies. Finally, the transcriptomic analyses confirmed 
the hematoendothelial, endothelial and hematopoietic identity of hPSC-EB-CD144+, 
hPSC-ECs and hPSC-BCs, respectively, and the similarities between 
hPSC-BC-CD144+CD45+, a subpopulation of hPSC-BCs, and human EL hematopoietic 
stem cells/hematopoietic progenitors.
CONCLUSION: The present work reports a hPSC differentiation protocol into 
functional hematopoietic and endothelial cells through a hematoendothelial 
population. Both lineages were proven to display characteristics of 
physiological human cells, and therefore, they represent an interesting rapid 
source of cells for future cell therapy and tissue engineering.
