BACKGROUND: Arginine is a high-value product, especially for the pharmaceutical 
industry. Growing demand for environmental-friendly and traceable products have 
stressed the need for microbial production of this amino acid. Therefore, the 
aim of this study was to improve arginine production in Escherichia coli by 
metabolic engineering and to establish a fermentation process in 1-L bioreactor 
scale to evaluate the different mutants.
RESULTS: Firstly, argR (encoding an arginine responsive repressor protein), 
speC, speF (encoding ornithine decarboxylases) and adiA (encoding an arginine 
decarboxylase) were knocked out and the feedback-resistant argA214 or argA215 
were introduced into the strain. Three glutamate independent mutants were 
assessed in bioreactors. Unlike the parent strain, which did not excrete any 
arginine during glucose fermentation, the constructs produced between 1.94 and 
3.03 g/L arginine. Next, wild type argA was deleted and the gene copy number of 
argA214 was raised, resulting in a slight increase in arginine production 
(4.11 g/L) but causing most of the carbon flow to be redirected toward acetate. 
The V216A mutation in argP (transcriptional regulator of argO, which encodes for 
an arginine exporter) was identified as a potential candidate for improved 
arginine production. The combination of multicopy of argP216 or argO and argA214 
led to nearly 2-fold and 3-fold increase in arginine production, respectively, 
and a reduction of acetate formation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, E. coli was successfully engineered for enhanced 
arginine production. The ∆adiA, ∆speC, ∆speF, ∆argR, ∆argA mutant with high gene 
copy number of argA214 and argO produced 11.64 g/L of arginine in batch 
fermentation, thereby demonstrating the potential of E. coli as an industrial 
producer of arginine.
