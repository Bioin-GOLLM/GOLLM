Human norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, yet basic 
questions about its life cycle remain unanswered due to an historical lack of 
robust experimental systems. Recent studies on the closely related murine 
norovirus (MNV) have identified CD300LF as an indispensable entry factor for 
MNV. We compared the MNV susceptibilities of cells from different mouse strains 
and identified polymorphisms in murine CD300LF which are critical for its 
function as an MNV receptor. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from I/LnJ 
mice were resistant to infection from multiple MNV strains which readily infect 
BMDMs from C57BL/6J mice. The resistance of I/LnJ BMDMs was specific to MNV, 
since the cells supported infection of other viruses comparably to C57BL/6J 
BMDMs. Transduction of I/LnJ BMDMs with C57BL/6J CD300LF made the cells 
permissible to MNV infection, suggesting that the cause of resistance lies in 
the entry step of MNV infection. In fact, we mapped this phenotype to a 
4-amino-acid difference at the CC' loop of CD300LF; swapping of these amino 
acids between C57BL/6J and I/LnJ CD300LF proteins made the mutant C57BL/6J 
CD300LF functionally impaired and the corresponding mutant of I/LnJ CD300LF 
functional as an MNV entry factor. Surprisingly, expression of the I/LnJ CD300LF 
in other cell types made the cells infectible by MNV, even though the I/LnJ 
allele did not function as an MNV receptor in macrophage-like cells. 
Correspondingly, I/LnJ CD300LF bound MNV virions in permissive cells but not in 
nonpermissive cells. Collectively, our data suggest the existence of a cell 
type-specific modifier of MNV entry.IMPORTANCE MNV is a prevalent model system 
for studying human norovirus, which is the leading cause of gastroenteritis 
worldwide and thus a sizeable public health burden. Elucidating mechanisms 
underlying susceptibility of host cells to MNV infection can lead to insights on 
the roles that specific cell types play during norovirus pathogenesis. Here, we 
show that different alleles of the proteinaceous receptor for MNV, CD300LF, 
function in a cell type-dependent manner. In contrast to the C57BL/6J allele, 
which functions as an MNV entry factor in all tested cell types, including human 
cells, I/LnJ CD300LF does not function as an MNV entry factor in macrophage-like 
cells but does allow MNV entry in other cell types. Together, these observations 
indicate the existence of cell type-specific modifiers of CD300LF-dependent MNV 
entry.
