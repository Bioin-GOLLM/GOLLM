Amyloid fibrils are the pathological hallmark of a large variety of 
neurodegenerative disorders. The structural characterization of amyloid fibrils, 
however, is challenging due to their non-crystalline, heterogeneous, and often 
dynamic nature. Thus, the structure of amyloid fibrils of many proteins is still 
unknown. We here show that the structure calculation program CS-Rosetta can be 
used to obtain insight into the core structure of amyloid fibrils. Driven by 
experimental solid-state NMR chemical shifts and taking into account the 
polymeric nature of fibrils CS-Rosetta allows modeling of the core of amyloid 
fibrils. Application to the Y145X stop mutant of the human prion protein reveals 
a left-handed β-helix.
