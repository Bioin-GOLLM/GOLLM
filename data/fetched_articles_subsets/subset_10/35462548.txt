BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that is 
characterized by the overproduction of cytokines. Among the newly discovered 
cytokines are the adipokines which are primarily produced by and released from 
the adipose tissue and some immune cells, as well as synovial cells. they are 
involved in various immune responses and inflammatory processes. However, there 
are controversial data regarding the pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory 
effects of adipokines in different conditions. C1q/TNF-related protein 5 (CTRP5) 
is a newly identified adipokine and adiponectin paralogous protein, which has 
been shown to be correlated with inflammatory diseases. Accordingly, the present 
study was designed to investigate the serum levels of CTRP5 in RA patients and 
evaluate any possible alterations in comparison to healthy individuals.
METHODS: Serum CTRP-5 levels were measured in 46 patients and 22 healthy 
controls by ELISA. The demographic, laboratory, and clinical features of the 
patients were also evaluated in order to find any correlations.
RESULTS: Serum levels of CTRP-5 were significantly (p < 0.0001) higher in 
patients with RA (14.88 ± 25.55) compared to healthy controls (4.262 ± 2.374). 
There was a significant correlation between serum CTRP-5 levels and triglyceride 
(TG) (r: - 0.3010, p: 0.0498), as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 
(r: 0.3139, p: 0.0457), C-reactive protein (CRP) (r: 0.5140, p: 0.0008), and the 
number of white blood cells (WBC) (r: 0.3380, p: 0.0307), which are considered 
as the markers indicating the extent of inflammation. Moreover, CTRP-5 was found 
to be correlated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) (r: 0.3416, p: 0.0385), a 
comorbidity associated with RA disease.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the increased level of circulating CTRP-5 in 
RA patients, which correlated with some inflammation-associated parameters and 
RA-associated comorbidities. Our observations suggest CTRP-5 as a putative 
inflammatory biomarker in RA, which may be useful besides the other 
disease-related markers.
