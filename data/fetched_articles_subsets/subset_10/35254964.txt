PURPOSE: The limitations of the current chemotherapeutics are the main rational 
to develop and/or explore new anticancer agents and radiolabeled analogues for 
cancer early diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The newly synthesized p-methoxyphenyl maleanilic acid 
(MPMA) was prepared, characterized and investigated for its anticancer activity. 
MPMA screened in-vitro against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2), human 
colon carcinoma (HCT-116) and human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines. 
Furthermore, the in-vivo screening was performed by radiolabeling of MPMA with 
technetium-99m (99mTc) and investigating its biological distribution in normal 
mice and solid tumor models. Moreover, MPMA and its radiolabeled analogue were 
docked to Y220C and Y220S mutants of p53 (p53Y220C and p53Y220S) in an effort to 
confirm their affinity to cancer as well as to investigate, virtually, the 
mechanism of action of MPMA.
RESULTS: The results revealed significant potency of MPMA against HepG-2 cell 
line (IC50 = 56.2 ± 1.5 µg/mL) if compared to HCT-116 (IC50 = 89.9 ± 1.8 µg/mL) 
and MCF-7 (IC50 = 104 ± 2.7 µg/mL) cell lines. The radiolabeling yield was 
optimized to be 90.2 ± 2.1%. The radiolabeled MPMA showed a good localization in 
the site of solid tumor (15.1 ± 1.6%ID/g) at 2 h post intravenous administration 
to the tumor bearing mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the findings confirmed the potential anticancer 
activity of MPMA and the possible use of 99mTc-MPMA for cancer diagnosis and 
monitoring.
