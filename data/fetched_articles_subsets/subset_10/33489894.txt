To identify a glycolysis-related gene signature for the evaluation of prognosis 
in patients with breast cancer, we analyzed the data of a training set from TCGA 
database and four validation cohorts from the GEO and ICGC databases which 
included 1,632 patients with breast cancer. We conducted GSEA, univariate Cox 
regression, LASSO, and multiple Cox regression analysis. Finally, an 11-gene 
signature related to glycolysis for predicting survival in patients with breast 
cancer was developed. And Kaplan-Meier analysis and ROC analyses suggested that 
the signature showed a good prognostic ability for BC in the TCGA, ICGC, and GEO 
datasets. The analyses of univariate Cox regression and multivariate Cox 
regression revealed that it's an important prognostic factor independent of 
multiple clinical features. Moreover, a prognostic nomogram, combining the gene 
signature and clinical characteristics of patients, was constructed. These 
findings provide insights into the identification of breast cancer patients with 
a poor prognosis.
