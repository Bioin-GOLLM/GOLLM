"γc" cytokines are a family whose receptors share a "common-gamma-chain" 
signaling moiety, and play central roles in differentiation, homeostasis, and 
communications of all immunocyte lineages. As a resource to better understand 
their range and specificity of action, we profiled by RNAseq the immediate-early 
responses to the main γc cytokines across all immunocyte lineages. The results 
reveal an unprecedented landscape: broader, with extensive overlap between 
cytokines (one cytokine doing in one cell what another does elsewhere) and 
essentially no effects unique to any one cytokine. Responses include a major 
downregulation component and a broad Myc-controlled resetting of biosynthetic 
and metabolic pathways. Various mechanisms appear involved: fast transcriptional 
activation, chromatin remodeling, and mRNA destabilization. Other surprises were 
uncovered: IL2 effects in mast cells, shifts between follicular and marginal 
zone B cells, paradoxical and cell-specific cross-talk between interferon and γc 
signatures, or an NKT-like program induced by IL21 in CD8+ T cells.
