Using solvent-exposed intramolecular backbone hydrogen bonds as physico-chemical 
descriptors for protein packing, a role for transient, non-obligate oligomers in 
the formation of aberrant protein aggregates is presented. Oligomeric models of 
the both wild type (wt) and select mutant variants of superoxide dismutase 
(SOD1) are proposed to provide a structural basis for investigating the etiology 
of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).
