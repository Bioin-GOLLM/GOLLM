GZD824 is a novel third-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor. It entered Phase II 
clinical trials in China and Phase Ib clinical trials in USA in 2019 for 
treatment of patients with resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We found 
that at concentrations below 10 nM, GZD824 significantly suppresses FLT3, FGFR1 
and PDGFRα kinase activities and inhibits their signal pathways in 
MV4-11Flt3-ITD, KG-1FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 and EOL-1FIP1L1-PDGFRa leukemia cells. It 
selectively inhibits the growth of MV4-11Flt3-ITD, KG-1FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 and 
EOL-1FIP1L1-PDGFRa cells, and also effectively suppresses the growth of 
Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells harboring F691I and other mutations with IC50 values <10 
nM. GZD824 induces G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in MV4-11, KG-1 and EOL-1 
cells and activates cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. In MV4-11, Ba/F3-ITD-F691I 
and KG-1 mouse xenograft models, GZD824 at 10 or 20 mg/kg, q2d, p.o. almost 
completely eradicates tumors. It also inhibits the viability of primary leukemic 
blasts from a FLT3-ITD positive AML patient but not those expressing native 
FLT3. Thus GZD824 suppresses leukemia cells of FLT3-ITD-driven AML and other 
hematologic malignancies driven by FGFR1 or PDGFRa, and it may be considered to 
be a novel agent for the treatment of leukemia.
