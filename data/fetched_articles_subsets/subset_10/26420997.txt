The prevalence of bone metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) is quite low and 
the presence of isolated osseous metastases at the time of diagnosis or the 
onset of bone metastases without other organ involvement during follow-up is 
even lower. Here, we present an interesting case of diffuse skeletal metastases 
from CRC in which both the atypical presentation of the metastatic spread and 
the presence of infective comorbidities created some troubles in getting the 
final diagnosis.
