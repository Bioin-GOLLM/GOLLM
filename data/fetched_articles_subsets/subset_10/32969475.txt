Signaling by the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) involves pre-mRNA splicing, a 
key process of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. However, the 
regulatory mechanism of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in ABA signaling remains 
largely unknown. We previously identified a pentatricopeptide repeat protein 
SOAR1 (suppressor of the ABAR-overexpressor 1) as a crucial player downstream of 
ABAR (putative ABA receptor) in ABA signaling. In this study, we identified a 
SOAR1 interaction partner USB1, which is an exoribonuclease catalyzing U6 
production for spliceosome assembly. We reveal that together USB1 and SOAR1 
negatively regulate ABA signaling in early seedling development. USB1 and SOAR1 
are both required for the splicing of transcripts of numerous genes, including 
those involved in ABA signaling pathways, suggesting that USB1 and SOAR1 
collaborate to regulate ABA signaling by affecting spliceosome assembly. These 
findings provide important new insights into the mechanistic control of 
alternative pre-mRNA splicing in the regulation of ABA-mediated plant responses 
to environmental cues.
