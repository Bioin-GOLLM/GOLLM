OBJECTIVE: To assess the possible association between PTPN22 1858C(R)T 
polymorphism and susceptibility to giant cell arteritis (GCA) and to determine 
if this polymorphism is implicated in the clinical expression of this 
vasculitis.
METHODS: Ninety-six patients with biopsy-proven GCA and 229 ethnically matched 
controls from the Lugo region of Northwest Spain were studied using molecular 
methods. All individuals were of Spanish Caucasian origin. Genotyping of PTPN22 
gene 1858C(R)T polymorphism was performed by real time polymerase chain reaction 
technology, using TaqMan 5' allelic discrimination assay.
RESULTS: No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies for PTPN22 
polymorphism were observed between patients with GCA and controls or when 
patients were stratified by presence of polymyalgia rheumatica (n = 38) or 
severe ischemic manifestations (n = 47).
CONCLUSION: Our results do not support potential involvement of PTPN22 gene 
polymorphism in the susceptibility or clinical expression of GCA.
