FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are indispensable for immune homoeostasis and 
for the prevention of autoimmune diseases. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signalling is 
critical in all aspects of Treg biology. Consequences of defective IL-2 
signalling are insufficient numbers or dysfunction of Treg and hence autoimmune 
disorders in human and mouse. The restoration and maintenance of immune 
homoeostasis remain central therapeutic aims in the field of autoimmunity. 
Historically, broadly immunosuppressive drugs with serious side-effects have 
been used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases or prevention of 
organ-transplant rejection. More recently, ex vivo expanded or in vivo 
stimulated Treg have been shown to induce effective tolerance in clinical trials 
supporting the clinical benefit of targeting natural immunosuppressive 
mechanisms. Given the central role of exogenous IL-2 in Treg homoeostasis, a new 
and promising focus in drug development are IL-2-based approaches for in vivo 
targeted expansion of Treg or for enhancement of their suppressive activity. In 
this review, we summarise the role of IL-2 in Treg biology and consequences of 
dysfunctional IL-2 signalling pathways. We then examine evidence of efficacy of 
IL-2-based biological drugs targeting Treg with specific focus on therapeutic 
candidates in clinical trials and discuss their limitations.
