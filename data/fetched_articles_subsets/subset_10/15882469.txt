BACKGROUND: Human cytochrome P450 3A enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, 
play an important role in drug metabolism. CYP3A expression exhibits substantial 
interindividual variation, much of which may result from genetic variation. This 
study describes Pyrosequencing assays for key SNPs in CYP3A4 (CYP3A4*1B, 
CYP3A4*2, and CYP3A4*3) and CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*3C and CYP3A5*6).
METHODS: Genotyping of 95 healthy European and 95 healthy African volunteers was 
performed using Pyrosequencing. Linkage disequilibrium, haplotype inference, 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and tag SNPs were also determined for these samples.
RESULTS: CYP3A4*1B allele frequencies were 4% in Europeans and 82% in Africans. 
The CYP3A4*2 allele was found in neither population sample. CYP3A4*3 had an 
allele frequency of 2% in Europeans and 0% in Africans. The frequency of 
CYP3A5*3C was 94% in Europeans and 12% in Africans. No CYP3A5*6 variants were 
found in the European samples, but this allele had a frequency of 16% in the 
African samples. Allele frequencies and haplotypes show interethnic variation, 
highlighting the need to analyze clinically relevant SNPs and haplotypes in a 
variety of ethnic groups.
CONCLUSION: Pyrosequencing is a versatile technique that could improve the 
efficiency of SNP analysis for pharmacogenomic research with the ultimate goal 
of pre-screening patients for individual therapy selection.
