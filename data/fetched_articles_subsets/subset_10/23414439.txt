BACKGROUND: The calories in alcoholic beverages consumed by alcoholics are a 
major energy source and a strong modifier of their body weight. Genetic 
polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase-1B (ADH1B) and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 
(ALDH2) affect susceptibility to alcoholism and may affect body weight via 
gene-associated differences in fuel utilization in alcoholics.
METHODS: We evaluated associations between ADH1B/ALDH2 genotypes and the body 
weight and body mass index (BMI) of 1,301 Japanese alcoholic men at the time of 
their first visit to an addiction center.
RESULTS: Median (25th to 75th) caloric intake in the form of alcoholic beverages 
was 864 (588 to 1,176) kcal/d. Age-adjusted caloric intake did not differ 
according to ADH1B/ALDH2 genotypes. The body weight and BMI values showed that 
the ADH1B*2/*2 and *1/*2 carriers (n = 939) were significantly leaner than the 
ADH1B*1/*1 carriers (n = 362) irrespective of age, drinking, smoking, and 
dietary habits. The age-adjusted body weight values of the ADH1B*2/*2, 
ADH1B*1/*2, and ADH1B*1/*1 carriers were 58.4 ± 0.4, 58.7 ± 0.5, and 63.6 ± 0.5 
kg, respectively (ADH1B*2 vs. ADH1B*1/*1 carriers, p < 0.0001), and the 
corresponding BMI values were 21.0 ± 0.1, 21.0 ± 0.1, and 22.9 ± 0.2 kg/m(2) , 
respectively (ADH1B*2 vs. ADH1B*1/*1 carriers, p < 0.0001). No effects of 
inactive ALDH2 on body weight or BMI were observed. A multivariate analysis 
showed that BMI decreased by 0.35 per 10-year increase in age, by 1.73 in the 
presence of the ADH1B*2 allele, by 1.55 when the preferred beverage was whiskey, 
and by 0.19 per +10 cigarettes/d and that it increased by 0.10 per +22 g ethanol 
(EtOH)/d and by 0.41 per increase in category of frequency of milk intake (every 
day, occasionally, rarely, and never). The increase in BMI as alcohol 
consumption increased was significantly smaller in the ADH1B*2 group than in the 
ADH1B*1/*1 group (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: ADH1B genotype was a strong determinant of body weight in the 
alcoholics. The more rapid EtOH elimination associated with the ADH1B*2 allele 
may result in less efficient utilization of EtOH as an energy source in 
alcoholics.
