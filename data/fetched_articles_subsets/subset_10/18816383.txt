BACKGROUND: Familial hypomagnesaemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis 
(FHHNC) is an autosomal recessive disorder of renal calcium and magnesium 
wasting frequently complicated by progressive chronic renal failure in childhood 
or adolescence.
METHODS: A 7 year old boy was investigated following the findings of marked 
renal insufficiency and nephrocalcinosis in his 18-month old sister. He too was 
found to have extensive nephrocalcinosis with increased fractional excretion of 
magnesium: 12.4% (<4%) and hypercalciuria: 5.7 mmol (< 2.5/24 hours). He had 
renal impairment, partial distal renal tubular acidosis and defective urinary 
concentrating ability. Therapy with thiazide diuretics and magnesium supplements 
failed to halt the progression of the disorder. Both children subsequently 
underwent renal transplantation. Both children's parents are unaffected and 
there is one unaffected sibling.
RESULTS: Mutation analysis revealed 2 heterozygous mutations in the claudin 16 
gene (CLDN16) in both affected siblings; one missense mutation in exon 4: C646T 
which results in an amino acid change Arg216Cys in the second extracellular loop 
of CLDN16 and loss of function of the protein and a donor splice site mutation 
which changes intron 4 consensus splice site from 'GT' to 'TT' resulting in 
decreased splice efficiency and the formation of a truncated protein with loss 
of 64 amino acids in the second extracellular loop.
CONCLUSION: The mutations in CLDN16 in this kindred affect the second 
extra-cellular loop of claudin 16. The clinical course and molecular findings 
suggest complete loss of function of the protein in the 2 affected cases and 
highlight the case for molecular diagnosis in individuals with FHHNC.
