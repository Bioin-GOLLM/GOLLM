The genus Cavariella is distinguished from other Macrosiphini genera (Aphididae, 
Aphidinae) because it has a supra-caudal process on abdominal tergite VIII which 
possesses two setae distally. It is Holarctic in distribution, and half of its 
species are Asian. The Chinese fauna of this genus, 17 species, have been 
restudied, morphologically and through DNA barcodes. As a result: 
Cavariellahidaensis Takahashi is transferred to Elatobium; Cavariellasculptura 
Qiao & Xu, sp. nov. is described from specimens collected on Torilis and 
Cryptotaenia (Apiaceae); Cavariellacessana Zhang, Chen, Zhong & Li, syn. nov. 
and Cavariellalargispiracula Zhang, Chen, Zhong & Li, syn. nov. are respectively 
junior synonyms of Cavariellaaquatica (Gillette & Bragg) and 
Cavariellasapporoensis Takahashi; Cavariellagilgiana Zhang, Chen, Zhong & Li and 
Cavariellalhasana Zhang are confirmed as valid species and complete descriptions 
are provided; Cavariellabhutanensis Chakrabarti & Das, Cavariellanigra Basu, 
Cavariellapastinacae (Linnaeus), and Cavariellapustula Essig are recorded for 
the first time from China. Additionally, keys for species of Cavariella known in 
China are provided and modifications to the key by Blackman and Eastop of aphid 
species on Angelica (Aphids on World's Plants) are presented.
