Keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) protect the epidermis against mechanical 
force, support strong adhesion, help barrier formation, and regulate growth. The 
mechanisms by which type I and II keratins contribute to these functions remain 
incompletely understood. Here, we report that mice lacking all type I or type II 
keratins display severe barrier defects and fragile skin, leading to perinatal 
mortality with full penetrance. Comparative proteomics of cornified envelopes 
(CEs) from prenatal KtyI(-/-) and KtyII(-/-)(K8) mice demonstrates that absence 
of KIF causes dysregulation of many CE constituents, including downregulation of 
desmoglein 1. Despite persistence of loricrin expression and upregulation of 
many Nrf2 targets, including CE components Sprr2d and Sprr2h, extensive barrier 
defects persist, identifying keratins as essential CE scaffolds. Furthermore, we 
show that KIFs control mitochondrial lipid composition and activity in a 
cell-intrinsic manner. Therefore, our study explains the complexity of 
keratinopathies accompanied by barrier disorders by linking keratin scaffolds to 
mitochondria, adhesion, and CE formation.
