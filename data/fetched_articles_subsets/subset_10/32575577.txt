Glucocorticoid provokes bone mass loss and fatty marrow, accelerating 
osteoporosis development. Bromodomain protein BRD4, an acetyl-histone-binding 
chromatin reader, regulates stem cell and tissue homeostasis. We uncovered that 
glucocorticoid inhibited acetyl Lys-9 at the histone 3 (H3K9ac)-binding Runx2 
promoter and decreased osteogenic differentiation, whereas bromodomain protein 4 
(BRD4) and adipocyte formation were upregulated in bone-marrow mesenchymal 
progenitor cells. BRD4 knockdown improved H3K9ac occupation at the Runx2 
promoter and osteogenesis, but attenuated glucocorticoid-mediated adipocyte 
formation together with the unaffected H3K9ac-binding PPARγ2 promoter. BRD4 
regulated epigenome related to fatty acid metabolism and the forkhead box P1 
(Foxp1) pathway, which occupied the PPARγ2 promoter to modulate 
glucocorticoid-induced adipocytic activity. In vivo, BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1 
treatment mitigated methylprednisolone-induced suppression of bone mass, 
trabecular microstructure, mineral acquisition, and osteogenic differentiation. 
Foxp1 signaling, marrow fat, and adipocyte formation in glucocorticoid-treated 
skeleton were reversed upon JQ-1 treatment. Taken together, 
glucocorticoid-induced H3K9 hypoacetylation augmented BRD4 action to Foxp1, 
which steered mesenchymal progenitor cells toward adipocytes at the cost of 
osteogenic differentiation in osteoporotic skeletons. BRD4 inhibition slowed 
bone mass loss and marrow adiposity. Collective investigations convey a new 
epigenetic insight into acetyl histone reader BRD4 control of osteogenesis and 
adipogenesis in skeleton, and highlight the remedial effects of the BRD4 
inhibitor on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.
