Previously, we reported the synthesis of Ti[N( o-(NCH2P( iPr)2)C6H4)3] and the 
Fe-Ti complex, FeTi[N( o-(NCH2P( iPr)2)C6H4)3], abbreviated as TiL (1), and 
FeTiL (2), respectively. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization 
of the complete redox families of the monometallic Ti and Fe-Ti compounds. 
Cyclic voltammetry studies on FeTiL reveal both reduction and oxidation 
processes at -2.16 and -1.36 V (versus Fc/Fc+), respectively. Two isostructural 
redox members, [FeTiL]+ and [FeTiL]- (2ox and 2red, respectively) were 
synthesized and characterized, along with BrFeTiL (2-Br) and the monometallic 
[TiL]+ complex (1ox). The solid-state structures of the [FeTiL]+/0/- series 
feature short metal-metal bonds, ranging from 1.94-2.38 Å, which are all shorter 
than the sum of the Ti and Fe single-bond metallic radii (cf. 2.49 Å). To 
elucidate the bonding and electronic structures, the complexes were 
characterized with a host of spectroscopic methods, including NMR, EPR, and 57Fe 
Mössbauer, as well as Ti and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). 
These studies, along with hybrid density functional theory (DFT) and 
time-dependent DFT calculations, suggest that the redox processes in the 
isostructural [FeTiL]+,0,- series are primarily Fe-based and that the polarized 
Fe-Ti π-bonds play a role in delocalizing some of the additional electron 
density from Fe to Ti (net 13%).
