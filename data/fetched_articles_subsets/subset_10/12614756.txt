PURPOSE: Mutations of the forkhead transcription factor gene FOXC1 result in 
anterior segment anomalies. No description of the spectrum of defects resulting 
from a single point mutation of this gene exists in the ophthalmology 
literature. We have screened all available patients with Axenfeld-Rieger genes 
(PITX2 and FOXC1). In this report, we clinically characterize the spectrum of 
ocular and systemic manifestations in one family resulting from a previously 
reported point mutation (Phe112Ser) in FOXC1.
DESIGN: Observational case series.
METHODS: Ten members of a multigenerational family were examined for signs of 
glaucoma, anterior segment abnormalities, and systemic features of 
Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. The examinations were performed in an ophthalmology 
examination room or in the patients' homes. Blood was obtained from 10 members 
and screened for mutations in FOXC1 using direct DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: A single mutation causing a T to C change in codon 112 (Phe112Ser) of 
FOXC1 was present in six members of the family. Five of these six patients were 
examined and all demonstrated anterior segment anomalies. One patient had 
Axenfeld anomaly, one had Rieger syndrome, and one had both Axenfeld anomaly and 
Peters anomaly. Additionally, some members demonstrated cardiac abnormalities, 
which may be secondary to their FOXC1 mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: A wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes can result from a single 
point mutation of FOXC1. This report confirms that Rieger syndrome (with dental 
and facial abnormalities) can be caused by a mutation in FOXC1. It is also the 
first report of Peters anomaly being caused by a FOXC1 mutation.
