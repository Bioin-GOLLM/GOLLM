Evidence has shown that cardiometabolic disorders (CMDs) are amongst the top 
contributors to COVID-19 infection morbidity and mortality. The reciprocal 
impact of COVID-19 infection and the most common CMDs, the risk factors for poor 
composite outcome among patients with one or several underlying diseases, the 
effect of common medical management on CMDs and their safety in the context of 
acute COVID-19 infection are reviewed. Later on, the changes brought by the 
COVID-19 pandemic quarantine on the general population's lifestyle (diet, 
exercise patterns) and metabolic health, acute cardiac complications of 
different COVID-19 vaccines and the effect of CMDs on the vaccine efficacy are 
discussed. Our review identified that the incidence of COVID-19 infection is 
higher among patients with underlying CMDs such as hypertension, diabetes, 
obesity and cardiovascular disease. Also, CMDs increase the risk of COVID-19 
infection progression to severe disease phenotypes (e.g. hospital and/or ICU 
admission, use of mechanical ventilation). Lifestyle modification during 
COVID-19 era had a great impact on inducing and worsening of CMDs. Finally, the 
lower efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines was found in patients with metabolic 
disease.
