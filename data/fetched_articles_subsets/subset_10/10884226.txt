Hypertension and pregnancy-related hypertension are major public health problems 
of largely unknown causes. We describe a mutation in the mineralocorticoid 
receptor (MR), S810L, that causes early-onset hypertension that is markedly 
exacerbated in pregnancy. This mutation results in constitutive MR activity and 
alters receptor specificity, with progesterone and other steroids lacking 
21-hydroxyl groups, normally MR antagonists, becoming potent agonists. 
Structural and biochemical studies indicate that the mutation results in the 
gain of a van der Waals interaction between helix 5 and helix 3 that substitutes 
for interaction of the steroid 21-hydroxyl group with helix 3 in the wild-type 
receptor. This helix 5-helix 3 interaction is highly conserved among diverse 
nuclear hormone receptors, suggesting its general role in receptor activation.
