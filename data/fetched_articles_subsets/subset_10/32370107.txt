Polyphenols are plant secondary metabolites with diverse biological and 
potential therapeutic activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and 
anticancer, among others. However, their extraction from the native plants is 
not enough to satisfy the increasing demand for this type of compounds. The 
development of microbial cell factories to effectively produce polyphenols may 
represent the most attractive solution to overcome this limitation and produce 
high amounts of these bioactive molecules. With the advances in the synthetic 
biology field, the development of efficient microbial cell factories has become 
easier, largely due to the development of the molecular biology techniques and 
by the identification of novel isoenzymes in plants or simpler organisms to 
construct the heterologous pathways. Furthermore, efforts have been made to make 
the process more profitable through improvements in the host chassis. In this 
review, advances in the production of polyphenols by genetically engineered 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as by synthetic biology and metabolic 
engineering approaches to improve the production of these compounds at 
industrial settings are discussed.
