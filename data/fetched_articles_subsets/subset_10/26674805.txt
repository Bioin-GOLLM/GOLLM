BACKGROUND: Despite heritability estimates of 40-70 % for obesity, less than 2 % 
of its variation is explained by Body Mass Index (BMI) associated loci that have 
been identified so far. Epistasis, or gene-gene interactions are a plausible 
source to explain portions of the missing heritability of BMI.
METHODS: Using genotypic data from 18,686 individuals across five study cohorts 
- ARIC, CARDIA, FHS, CHS, MESA - we filtered SNPs (Single Nucleotide 
Polymorphisms) using two parallel approaches. SNPs were filtered either on the 
strength of their main effects of association with BMI, or on the number of 
knowledge sources supporting a specific SNP-SNP interaction in the context of 
BMI. Filtered SNPs were specifically analyzed for interactions that are highly 
associated with BMI using QMDR (Quantitative Multifactor Dimensionality 
Reduction). QMDR is a nonparametric, genetic model-free method that detects 
non-linear interactions associated with a quantitative trait.
RESULTS: We identified seven novel, epistatic models with a Bonferroni corrected 
p-value of association < 0.1. Prior experimental evidence helps explain the 
plausible biological interactions highlighted within our results and their 
relationship with obesity. We identified interactions between genes involved in 
mitochondrial dysfunction (POLG2), cholesterol metabolism (SOAT2), lipid 
metabolism (CYP11B2), cell adhesion (EZR), cell proliferation (MAP2K5), and 
insulin resistance (IGF1R). Moreover, we found an 8.8 % increase in the variance 
in BMI explained by these seven SNP-SNP interactions, beyond what is explained 
by the main effects of an index FTO SNP and the SNPs within these interactions. 
We also replicated one of these interactions and 58 proxy SNP-SNP models 
representing it in an independent dataset from the eMERGE study.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights a novel approach for discovering gene-gene 
interactions by combining methods such as QMDR with traditional statistics.
