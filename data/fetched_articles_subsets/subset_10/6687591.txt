Inhibition of adrenocortical cytochrome P-450scc by (20R)-20-phenyl-5-pregnene-3 
beta,20-diol.

Vickery LE, Kellis JT.

The effects of the cholesterol analogue, (20R)-20-phenyl-5-pregnene-3 
beta,20-diol (20-PPD), on the catalytic and spectral properties of purified 
bovine adrenocortical cytochrome P-450scc were investigated. In contrast to 
results with cholesterol and (20R)-20-hydroxycholesterol, no conversion of 
20-PPD to pregnenolone could be detected; instead, 20-PPD was found to be a 
potent inhibitor of cytochrome P-450scc. Kinetic analyses showed that the 
inhibition is reversible and competitive with respect to cholesterol with an 
apparent Ki = 30nM. Spectral binding studies with ferricytochrome P-450scc 
showed that 20-PPD formed a 1:1 complex with the enzyme, having an absorption 
spectrum similar to that produced by (20R)-20-hydroxycholesterol. These results 
indicate that 20-PPD binds with very high affinity to the substrate site on 
cytochrome P-450scc. The finding that the phenyl side chain is readily 
accommodated suggests the presence in this site of an open pocket which may be 
normally occupied by C-22 to C-27 of the cholesterol side chain.
