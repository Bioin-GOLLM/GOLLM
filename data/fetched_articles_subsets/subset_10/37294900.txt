Here, we report a previously unrecognized syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder 
associated with biallelic loss-of-function variants in the RBM42 gene. The 
patient is a 2-year-old female with severe central nervous system (CNS) 
abnormalities, hypotonia, hearing loss, congenital heart defects, and dysmorphic 
facial features. Familial whole-exome sequencing (WES) reveals that the patient 
has two compound heterozygous variants, c.304C>T (p.R102*) and c.1312G>A 
(p.A438T), in the RBM42 gene which encodes an integral component of splicing 
complex in the RNA-binding motif protein family. The p.A438T variant is in the 
RRM domain which impairs RBM42 protein stability in vivo. Additionally, p.A438T 
disrupts the interaction of RBM42 with hnRNP K, which is the causative gene for 
Au-Kline syndrome with overlapping disease characteristics seen in the index 
patient. The human R102* or A438T mutant protein failed to fully rescue the 
growth defects of RBM42 ortholog knockout ΔFgRbp1 in Fusarium while it was 
rescued by the wild-type (WT) human RBM42. A mouse model carrying Rbm42 compound 
heterozygous variants, c.280C>T (p.Q94*) and c.1306_1308delinsACA (p.A436T), 
demonstrated gross fetal developmental defects and most of the double mutant 
animals died by E13.5. RNA-seq data confirmed that Rbm42 was involved in 
neurological and myocardial functions with an essential role in alternative 
splicing (AS). Overall, we present clinical, genetic, and functional data to 
demonstrate that defects in RBM42 constitute the underlying etiology of a new 
neurodevelopmental disease which links the dysregulation of global AS to 
abnormal embryonic development.
