The reaction of ZrCl4 with three equivalents of LiNCy2 (Cy is cyclo-hex-yl) 
resulted in the formation of tris-(di-cyclo-hexyl-amido)-zirconium chloride and 
the title compound, [Zr(C12H22N)4]. The latter is isotypic with its cerium(IV) 
analogue and crystallizes with three independent mol-ecules in the asymmetric 
unit. One mol-ecule is located about a twofold rotation axis, and the other two 
on fourfold inversion axes. In each mol-ecule, the ZrIV atom has a distorted 
tetra-hedral coordination environment. The crystal under investigation was 
twinned by inversion in a 1:1 ratio.
