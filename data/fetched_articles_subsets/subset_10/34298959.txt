Blood malignancies often arise from undifferentiated hematopoietic stem cells or 
partially differentiated stem-like cells. A tight balance of multipotency and 
differentiation, cell division, and quiescence underlying normal hematopoiesis 
requires a special program governed by the transcriptional machinery. 
Acquisition of drug resistance by tumor cells also involves reprogramming of 
their transcriptional landscape. Limiting tumor cell plasticity by disabling 
reprogramming of the gene transcription is a promising strategy for improvement 
of treatment outcomes. Herein, we review the molecular mechanisms of action of 
transcription-targeted drugs in hematological malignancies (largely in leukemia) 
with particular respect to the results of clinical trials.
