Excess Aβ production by the key protease BACE1, results in Aβ aggregation, 
forming amyloid plaques, all of which contribute to the pathogenesis of 
Alzheimer's disease. Besides the multi-factorial nature of the disease, the 
diversity in the size and shape of known ligands that bind to the active site of 
BACE1, that is the flexibility of the enzyme, pose a serious challenge for the 
identification of drug candidates. To address the issue of receptor flexibility 
we have carried out ensemble docking with multiple receptor conformations. 
Therein, two representative structures each from closed and semi-open BACE1 
conformations were selected for virtual screening to identify compounds that 
bind to the active site of both the conformations. These outperformed compounds 
were ranked using pharmacophore models generated by a ligand-based approach, for 
the identification of BACE1 inhibitors. The inhibitors were further predicted 
for anti-amyloidogenic activity using a QSAR model already established by our 
group thus enlisting compounds with dual potency. BACE1 inhibitory and 
anti-amyloidogenic activity for the commercially available compounds were 
validated using in vitro studies. Thus, incorporation of receptor flexibility in 
BACE1 through ensemble docking in conjunction with structure and ligand-based 
approach for screening might act as an effective protocol for obtaining 
promising scaffolds against AD.
