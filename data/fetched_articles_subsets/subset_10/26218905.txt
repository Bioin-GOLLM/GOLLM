PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence and spectrum of mitochondrial ND4 
mutations in subjects with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).
METHODS: A cohort of 1281 Chinese Han probands and 478 control subjects 
underwent clinical and genetic evaluation, and sequence analysis of 
mitochondrial (mt) DNA, as well as enzymatic assay of NADH:ubiquinone 
oxidoreductase.
RESULTS: In this cohort, 503 probands had a family history of optic neuropathy 
and 778 subjects were sporadic cases. Mutational analysis of ND4 gene identified 
149 (102 known and 47 novel) variants. The prevalence of known m.11778G>A 
mutation was 35.36%. Furthermore, we identified the known m.11696G>A and 
m.11253T>C mutations and five novel putative LHON-associated mutations. These 
mutations accounted for 2.74% of cases of LHON subjects. By enzymatic assay, we 
showed a mild decrease in the activity of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase in 
mutant cell lines carrying only one putative mtDNA mutation. The low penetrance 
of optic neuropathy and mild biochemical defects in these pedigrees carrying 
only m.11696G>A mutation and one putative LHON-associated mutation suggested 
that the mutation(s) is(are) necessary but is(are) itself(themselves) 
insufficient to produce a visual failure. Moreover, mtDNAs in 169 probands 
carrying the LHON-associated mutation(s) were widely dispersed among 13 Eastern 
Asian haplogroups. In particular, the frequencies of haplogroups D, M8, M10, 
M11, and H in probands carrying the LHON-associated mtDNA mutation(s) were 
higher than those in Chinese controls.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that the ND4 gene is the hot spot for 
mutations associated with LHON. Thus, these findings may provide valuable 
information for the further understanding of pathogenic mechanism of LHON.
