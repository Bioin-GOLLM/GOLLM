Rhodopsin is trafficked to the rod outer segment of vertebrate rod cells with 
high fidelity. When rhodopsin transport is disrupted retinal photoreceptors 
apoptose, resulting in the blinding disease autosomal dominant retinitis 
pigmentosa. Herein, we introduce rhodopsin-photoactivatable GFP-1D4 
(rhodopsin-paGFP-1D4) for the purposes of monitoring rhodopsin transport in 
living cells. Rhodopsin-paGFP-1D4 contains photoactivatable GFP (paGFP) fused to 
rhodopsin's C-terminus and the last eight amino acids of rhodopsin (1D4) 
appended to the C-terminus of paGFP. The fusion protein binds the chromophore 
11-cis retinal and photoisomerizes upon light activation similarly to rhodopsin. 
It activates the G-protein transducin with similar kinetics as does rhodopsin. 
Rhodopsin-paGFP-1D4 localizes to the same compartments, the primary cilium in 
cultured IMCD cells and the outer segment of rod cells, as rhodopsin in vitro 
and in vivo. This enables its use as a model of rhodopsin transport and details 
the importance of a free rhodopsin C-terminus in rod cell localization and 
health.
