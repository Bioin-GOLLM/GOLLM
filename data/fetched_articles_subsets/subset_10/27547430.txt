OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the association between genetic 
ancestry, self-declared race and haemodynamic parameters in patients with 
chronic heart failure (HF).
METHODS: Observational, cross-sectional study. Eligible participants were aged 
between 18 and 80 years; ejection fraction was ≤50%. Patients underwent genetic 
analysis of ancestry informative markers, echocardiography and impedance 
cardiography (ICG). Race was determined by self-classification into two groups: 
white and non-white. Genomic ancestry was estimated using a panel of 101 348 
polymorphic markers and three continental reference populations (European, 
African and Native American).
RESULTS: Our study included 362 patients with HF between August 2012 and August 
2014. 123 patients with HF declared themselves as white and 234 patients 
declared themselves as non-white. No statistically significant differences were 
found regarding the ICG parameters according to self-declared race. The 
Amerindian ancestry was positively correlated with systolic time ratio (r=0.109, 
p<0.05). The thoracic fluid content index (r=0.124. p<0.05), E wave peak 
(r=0.127. p<0.05) and E/e' ratio (r=0.197. p<0.01) were correlated positively 
with African ancestry. In multiple linear regression, African ancestry remained 
associated with the E/e' ratio, even after adjustment to risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The African genetic ancestry was associated with worse parameters 
of diastolic function; the Amerindian ancestry correlated with a worse pattern 
of ventricular contractility, while self-declared colour was not helpful to 
infer haemodynamic profiles in HF.
