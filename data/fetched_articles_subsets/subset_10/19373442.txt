INTRODUCTION: Cyclin D1 (CCND1) is a regulatory protein involved in the cell 
cycle. A common G to A polymorphism in the CCND1 gene is implicated on the 
splicing of the CCND1 transcript, and this protein may be associated to a 
deregulated cell proliferation.
AIM: Correlate the polymorphism A870G of CCND1 to the risk of colorectal cancer 
(CRC), to environmental risk factors and clinical aspects in Brazilian patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-three Brazilian patients with 
colorectal cancer were matched by age and sex to 120 healthy individuals. 
PCR-RFLP was performed to investigate the A870G CCND1 genotype.
RESULTS: Between the cases 70 were men, the mean age was 62.6 years, 74.78% were 
stage II or III, and 91% were well or moderately differentiated. The patients 
were followed for a mean time of 37.22 months. The frequency of ethanol and fat 
intake was similar among the groups. Patients with a family history of CRC had a 
higher frequency of CRC compared with the controls (OR 4.16, CI 1.89-9.16). 
There was no difference in the frequency of the alleles A (43.8% versus 43.9%) 
and G (56.3% versus 56.1%) in the groups. In analysis of both control and cancer 
group, the influence of sex, smoking, alcohol, fiber, or meat intake did not 
differ significantly according to CCND1 genotype. The genotype AA or AG was 
associated with an increased risk of CRC (OR 3.63 CI 1.25-10.5) in patients with 
a family history of cancer. We did not find any association among the genotypes 
and localization of the tumor or prognosis. Although a difference on age onset 
of the tumor and genotype was not observed, patients with GG genotype had a mean 
8 years lower than the others. This genotype was also associated to an increase 
risk of metastatic disease (OR 3.47, CI 1.38-8.68, p = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: We did not find a correlation among the polymorphism of CCND1 A870G 
and colorectal cancer risk or between this polymorphism and lifestyle habits, 
diet, or follow-up. GG genotype patients had an increased risk of advanced 
disease and between the young patients, this genotype was associated to a lower 
mean age. On the other hand, the genotype AA or AG had been involved to a higher 
risk of CRC in patients with family history of CRC.
