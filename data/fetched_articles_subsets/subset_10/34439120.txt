Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, with 
about 90% of cancer-related deaths occurring in developing countries. The 
geographical influence on disease evolution reflects differences in the 
prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, which is the main cause of 
CC, as well as in the access and quality of services for CC prevention and 
diagnosis. At present, the most diffused screening and diagnostic tools for CC 
are Papanicolaou test and the more sensitive HPV-DNA test, even if both methods 
require gynecological practices whose acceptance relies on the woman's cultural 
and religious background. An alternative (or complimentary) tool for CC 
screening, diagnosis, and follow-up might be represented by liquid biopsy. Here, 
we summarize the main methodologies developed in this context, including 
circulating tumor cell detection and isolation, cell tumor DNA sequencing, 
coding and non-coding RNA detection, and exosomal miRNA identification. 
Moreover, the pros and cons of each method are discussed, and their potential 
applications in diagnosis and prognosis of CC, as well as their role in 
treatment monitoring, are explored. In conclusion, it is evident that despite 
many advances obtained in this field, further effort is needed to validate and 
standardize the proposed methodologies before any clinical use.
