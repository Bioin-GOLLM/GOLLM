BACKGROUND: Vitiligo is a complex disease in which patchy depigmentation is the 
result of an autoimmune-induced loss of melanocytes in affected regions. On the 
basis of a genome-wide linkage analysis of vitiligo in the Chinese Han 
population, we previously showed significant evidence of a linkage between 22q12 
and vitiligo. Our aim in the current study was to identify vitiligo 
susceptibility variants within an expanded region of the 22q12 locus.
METHODS AND RESULTS: An in-depth analysis of the expanded region of the 22q12 
locus was performed by imputation using a large GWAS dataset consisting of 1117 
cases and 1701 controls. Eight nominal SNPs were selected and genotyped in an 
independent cohort of Chinese Han individuals (2069 patients and 1370 control 
individuals) by using the Sequenom MassArray iPLEX1 system. The data were 
analyzed with PLINK 1.07 software. The C allele of rs730669 located in 
ZDHHC8/RTN4R showed a strong association with vitiligo (P = 3.25 × 10-8, 
OR = 0.81). The C allele of rs4820338 located in VPREB1 and the A allele of 
rs2051582 (a SNP reported in our previous study) located in IL2RB showed a 
suggestive association with vitiligo (P = 1.04 × 10-5, OR = 0.86; 
P = 1.78 × 10-6, OR = 1.27). The three identified SNPs showed independent 
associations with vitiligo in a conditional logistic regression analysis (all 
P < 1.0 × 10-5; all D' < 0.05 and r2 < 1.0 × 10-4).
CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals that two novel variants rs730669 (ZDHHC8/RTN4R) 
and rs4820338 (VPREB1) on 22q11.2 might confer susceptibility to vitiligo and 
affect disease subphenotypes. The presence of multiple independent variants 
emphasizes their important roles in the genetic pathogenesis of disease.
