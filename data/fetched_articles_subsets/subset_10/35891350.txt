New variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
continue to emerge, causing surges, breakthrough infections, and devastating 
losses-underscoring the importance of identifying SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. A 
simple, accessible human cell culture model permissive to SARS-CoV-2 variants is 
critical for identifying and assessing antivirals in a high-throughput manner. 
Although human alveolar A549 cells are a valuable model for studying respiratory 
virus infections, they lack two essential host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection: 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 
(TMPRSS2). SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for viral entry and TMPRSS2 to 
prime the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, both of which are negligibly expressed in 
A549 cells. Here, we report the generation of a suitable human cell line for 
SARS-CoV-2 studies by transducing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 into A549 cells. We 
show that subclones highly expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 ("ACE2plus" and the 
subclone "ACE2plusC3") are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, including 
the delta and omicron variants. These subclones express more ACE2 and TMPRSS2 
transcripts than existing commercial A549 cells engineered to express ACE2 and 
TMPRSS2. Additionally, the antiviral drugs EIDD-1931, remdesivir, nirmatrelvir, 
and nelfinavir strongly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 variants in our infection model. Our 
data show that ACE2plusC3 cells are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection 
and can be used to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.
