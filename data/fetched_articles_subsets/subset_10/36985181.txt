Ultraviolet (UV) radiation responses of extremophilic and archaeal 
microorganisms are of interest from evolutionary, physiological, and 
astrobiological perspectives. Previous studies determined that the halophilic 
archaeon, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, which survives in multiple extremes, is 
highly tolerant of UV radiation. Here, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 UV tolerance was 
compared to taxonomically diverse Haloarchaea isolated from high-elevation salt 
flats, surface warm and cold hypersaline lakes, and subsurface Permian halite 
deposits. Haloterrigena/Natrinema spp. from subsurface halite deposits were the 
least tolerant after exposure to photoreactivating light. This finding was 
attributed to deviation of amino acid residues in key positions in the DNA 
photolyase enzyme or to the complete absence of the photolyase gene. Several 
Halobacterium, Halorubrum and Salarchaeum species from surface environments 
exposed to high solar irradiance were found to be the most UV tolerant, and 
Halorubrum lacusprofundi from lake sediment was of intermediate character. These 
results indicate that high UV tolerance is not a uniform character trait of 
Haloarchaea and is likely reflective of UV exposure experienced in their 
environment. This is the first report correlating natural UV tolerance to 
photolyase gene functionality among Haloarchaea and provides insights into their 
survival in ancient halite deposits and potentially on the surface of Mars.
