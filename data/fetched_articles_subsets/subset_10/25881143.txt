BACKGROUND: Psychological stressors may cause affective disorders, such as 
depression and anxiety, by altering expressions of corticotropin releasing 
factor (CRF), serotonin (5-HT), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the brain. This 
study investigated the effects of essential oil from Asarum heterotropoides 
(EOAH) on depression-like behaviors and brain expressions of CRF, 5-HT, and TH 
in mice challenged with stress.
METHODS: Male ICR mice received fragrance inhalation of EOAH (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 
and 2.0 g) for 3 h in the special cage capped with a filter paper before start 
of the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The duration 
of immobility was measured for the determination of depression-like behavior in 
the FST and TST. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine as 
positive control was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg (i.p.) 30 min before 
start of behavioral testing. Immunoreactivities of CRF, 5-HT, and TH in the 
brain were also measured using separate groups of mice subjected to the FST.
RESULTS: EOAH at higher doses (1.0 and 2.0 g) reduced immobility time in the FST 
and TST. In addition, EOAH at a dose of 1.0 g significantly reduced the expected 
increases in the expression of CRF positive neurons in the paraventricular 
nucleus and the expression of TH positive neurons in the locus coeruleus, and 
the expected decreases of the 5-HT positive neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus.
CONCLUSION: These results provide strong evidence that EOAH effectively inhibits 
depression-like behavioral responses, brain CRF and TH expression increases, and 
brain 5-HT expression decreases in mice challenged with stress.
