Severe viral pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by a hyperinflammatory state 
typified by elevated circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, frequently leading 
to potentially lethal vascular complications including thromboembolism, 
disseminated intracellular coagulopathy and vasculitis. Though endothelial 
infection and subsequent endothelial damage have been described in patients with 
fatal COVID-19, the mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive, particularly 
given that, under naïve conditions, pulmonary endothelial cells demonstrate 
minimal cell surface expression of the SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2. Herein 
we describe SARS-CoV-2 infection of the pulmonary endothelium in postmortem lung 
samples from individuals who died of COVID-19, demonstrating both heterogeneous 
ACE2 expression and endothelial damage. In primary endothelial cell cultures, we 
show that SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the induction of ACE2 protein 
expression and that this process is facilitated by type 1 interferon-alpha 
(IFNα) or -beta(β)-two of the main anti-viral cytokines induced in severe 
SARS-CoV-2 infection-but not significantly by other cytokines (including 
interleukin 6 and interferon γ/λ). Our findings suggest that the stereotypical 
anti-viral interferon response may paradoxically facilitate the propagation of 
COVID-19 from the respiratory epithelium to the vasculature, raising concerns 
regarding the use of exogenous IFNα/β in the treatment of patients with 
COVID-19.
