PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients 
with conjuctival melanoma (CjM).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study and literature review.
SUBJECTS: Slovenian patients with CjM are included in the study.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data of CjM patients treated from June 2005 to 
December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The numbers of SLN biopsy procedures, positive and false 
positive SLN, and local and regional relapses have been described together with 
overall survival.
RESULTS: From June 2005 until December 2016, 24 patients with CjM were treated. 
The median follow-up time was 65.3 months. The mean Breslow thickness was 1.5 mm 
(sd = 1.8 mm), and ulceration was present in 29% of cases. Altogether, 14/24 
(58%) SLN biopsy procedures were performed. SLN was positive in 2/14 (14%) 
cases. The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) of the group was 72.5%, with a 
median survival of 151 months (95% CI 77-224). From January 2013 to January 
2020, five (5/140, 3%) authors reported results comparable to our study.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that CjM is a rare disease with approximately 
14% of positive SLN. At the moment, there are no firm conclusions regarding who 
would benefit most from SLN biopsy or whether or not CLND should be offered. 
Data from literature emphasize the need for consistent and uniform staging and 
future multicentric studies.
