BMP2 (bone morphogenic protein-2) is a member of the TGF-β superfamily and has 
essential roles in the development of multiple organs, including osteogenesis. 
Because of its crucial role in organ and skeletal development, Bmp2 null mice is 
fetal lethal. The recent report has characterized multiple patients with BMP2 
haploinsufficiency, describing individuals with BMP2 sequence variants and 
deletions associated with short stature without endocrinological abnormalities, 
a recognizable craniofacial gestalt, skeletal anomalies, and congenital heart 
disease. However, due to a small number of reported patients with BMP2 
haploinsufficiency, the genotype and phenotype correlations are not fully 
understood. We experienced a family of BMP2 haploinsufficiency with a novel 
frameshift variant NM_001200.4: c.231dup (p.Tyr78Leufs*38) which was predicted 
to be "pathogenic" by the American College of Genetics and Genomics (ACGM) 
criteria. In addition to short stature, impaired hearing ability and minor 
skeletal deformities, the proband exhibited isolated dextrocardia situs solitus 
without cardiac anomalies and abnormal locations of other visceral organs. Our 
study would shed light on the crucial role of BMP2 in determining the cardiac 
axis, and further studies are needed to assemble more cases to elucidate BMP2 
role in human heart development.
