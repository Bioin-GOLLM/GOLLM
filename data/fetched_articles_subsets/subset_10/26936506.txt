Disability or death due to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is attributed to blood 
lysis, liberation of iron, and consequent oxidative stress. Iron chelators bind 
to free iron and prevent neuronal death induced by oxidative stress and 
disability due to ICH, but the mechanisms for this effect remain unclear. We 
show that the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase domain (HIF-PHD) 
family of iron-dependent, oxygen-sensing enzymes are effectors of iron 
chelation. Molecular reduction of the three HIF-PHD enzyme isoforms in the mouse 
striatum improved functional recovery after ICH. A low-molecular-weight 
hydroxyquinoline inhibitor of the HIF-PHD enzymes, adaptaquin, reduced neuronal 
death and behavioral deficits after ICH in several rodent models without 
affecting total iron or zinc distribution in the brain. Unexpectedly, protection 
from oxidative death in vitro or from ICH in vivo by adaptaquin was associated 
with suppression of activity of the prodeath factor ATF4 rather than activation 
of an HIF-dependent prosurvival pathway. Together, these findings demonstrate 
that brain-specific inactivation of the HIF-PHD metalloenzymes with the 
blood-brain barrier-permeable inhibitor adaptaquin can improve functional 
outcomes after ICH in several rodent models.
