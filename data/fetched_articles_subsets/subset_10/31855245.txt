Homozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are associated with neuronal 
ceroid lipofuscinosis 11 (CLN11), a rare lysosomal-storage disorder 
characterized by cerebellar ataxia, seizures, retinitis pigmentosa, and 
cognitive disorders, usually beginning between 13 and 25 years of age. This is a 
rare condition, previously reported in only four families. In contrast, 
heterozygous GRN mutations are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia 
associated with neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. We identified homozygous 
GRN mutations in six new patients. The phenotypic spectrum is much broader than 
previously reported, with two remarkably distinct presentations, depending on 
the age of onset. A childhood/juvenile form is characterized by classical CLN11 
symptoms at an early age at onset. Unexpectedly, other homozygous patients 
presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal dementia and 
parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar ataxia. Another 
major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not have the same 
impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of some mutations 
is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma progranulin and low 
levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a homozygous splice-site 
mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is a new critical finding 
that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on replacement strategies. 
The first neuropathological study in a homozygous carrier provides new insights 
into the pathological mechanisms of the disease. Hallmarks of neuronal ceroid 
lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions 
markedly differs from observations of heterozygous mutations, suggesting a 
pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43 pathologies depending on the 
mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing observation was the loss of normal 
TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some neurons, which could be the first stage 
of the TDP-43 pathological process preceding the formation of typical 
cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study has important implications for 
genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis. Semi-dominant inheritance of GRN 
mutations implies that specific genetic counselling should be delivered to 
children and parents of CLN11 patients, as they are heterozygous carriers with a 
high risk of developing dementia. More broadly, this study illustrates the fact 
that genetic variants can lead to different phenotypes according to their mono- 
or bi-allelic state, which is a challenge for genetic diagnosis.
