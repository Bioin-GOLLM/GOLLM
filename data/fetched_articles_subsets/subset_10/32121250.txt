Recent evidence suggests that autophagy impairment is implicated in the 
epileptogenic mechanisms downstream of mTOR hyperactivation. This holds true for 
a variety of genetic and acquired epileptic syndromes besides malformations of 
cortical development which are classically known as mTORopathies. Autophagy 
suppression is sufficient to induce epilepsy in experimental models, while 
rescuing autophagy prevents epileptogenesis, improves behavioral alterations, 
and provides neuroprotection in seizure-induced neuronal damage. The implication 
of autophagy in epileptogenesis and maturation phenomena related to seizure 
activity is supported by evidence indicating that autophagy is involved in the 
molecular mechanisms which are implicated in epilepsy. In general, 
mTOR-dependent autophagy regulates the proliferation and migration of 
inter-/neuronal cortical progenitors, synapse development, vesicular release, 
synaptic plasticity, and importantly, synaptic clustering of GABAA receptors and 
subsequent excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain. Similar to autophagy, the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system is regulated downstream of mTOR, and it is 
implicated in epileptogenesis. Thus, mTOR-dependent cell-clearing systems are 
now taking center stage in the field of epilepsy. In the present review, we 
discuss such evidence in a variety of seizure-related disorders and models. This 
is expected to provide a deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying 
seizure activity.
