AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Insulin stimulates translocation of glucose transporter 4 
(GLUT4) from the perinuclear location to the plasma membrane. In the 
unstimulated state, intracellular vesicles containing GLUT4 are sequestered into 
specialized storage vesicles that have come to be known as the 
insulin-responsive compartment (IRC). The IRC is a functional compartment in the 
perinuclear region that is a target of the insulin signaling cascade, although 
its precise nature is unclear. Here, we report a novel molecular mechanism 
facilitating formation of the IRC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined synaptosomal-associated protein of 29 kDa 
(SNAP29) by mass spectrometry to be an EH domain-containing protein 1 
(EHD1)-binding protein. Then, its expression was confirmed by western blotting. 
Subcellular localization of SNAP29 was determined by immunofluorescent 
microscopy. Interactions between SNAP29 and syntaxins were determined by 
immunoprecipitation. We measured glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in 
3T3-L1 adipocyte expressing SNAP29 or silencing SNAP29.
RESULTS: We found SNAP29 to be localized in the perinuclear region and to show 
partial co-localization with GLUT4 under basal conditions. We also found that 
SNAP29 binds to syntaxin6, a Qc-SNARE, in adipocytes. In SNAP29-expressing 
cells, vesicles containing GLUT4 were observed to aggregate around the 
perinuclear region. In contrast, when SNAP29 was silenced, perinuclear GLUT4 
vesicles were dispersed throughout the cytosol. Insulin-stimulated glucose 
uptake was inhibited in both SNAP29-expressing and SNAP29-silenced cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that SNAP29 sequesters and anchors 
GLUT4-containing vesicles in the perinuclear region, and might have a role in 
the biogenesis of the perinuclear IRC.
