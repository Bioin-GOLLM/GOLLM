PURPOSE: To assess the occurrence and diagnostic performance of nine 
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the TCF4, SLC4A11, LOXHD1, and AGBL1 genes 
and the CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat expansion in a Russian cohort of Fuchs' 
endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) patients.
METHODS: This retrospective case-control study included 100 patients diagnosed 
with FECD (cases) and 100 patients with cataracts (controls). Blood DNA was used 
to perform PCR and subsequent Sanger sequencing of rs613872 and rs17595731 in 
TCF4, c.99-100delTC, rs267607065, rs267607064, and rs267607066 in SLC4A11, 
rs113444922 in LOXHD1, and rs181958589 and rs185919705 in AGBL1. The number of 
CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats was determined by a combination of conventional 
PCR or triplet primed PCR with fragment analysis.
RESULTS: At least one rs613872 marker allele was found in 78% of FECD patients 
and 21% of controls, and at least one rs17595731 marker allele was found in 14% 
and 2%, respectively. CTG18.1 trinucleotide expansion (>40 repeats) was detected 
in 72% of FECD patients and 5% of controls. Marker alleles of the tested SNVs in 
SLC4A11, LOXHD1, and rs185919705 in AGBL1 were not found in our FECD cohort. One 
FECD patient carried the marker allele of the rs181958589 SNV. Analysis of the 
diagnostic performance of individual markers in TCF4 and their combinations 
showed that the CTG18.1 repeat expansion was the best classifier for FECD (AUC = 
0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients carrying CTG18.1 repeat expansion constituted a high 
proportion of the Russian FECD cohort; therefore, this marker is suitable for 
development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
