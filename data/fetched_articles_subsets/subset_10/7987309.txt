Genomic clones containing a human coproporphyrinogen oxidase gene, were 
isolated. DNA sequencing indicates that the human CPX gene spans about 14 kb and 
consists of seven exons and six introns. Sequences were determined for all the 
exons, exon-intron junctions and for 800 bp of promoter region. Introns vary in 
size from 269 bp to 5 kb and they all have consensus sequences at their 
boundaries. Primer extension and ribonuclease protection experiments revealed 
multiple transcriptional initiation sites in a region with sequence motifs 
characteristic of a promoter. The promoter region is GC-rich and contains 
multiple potential Sp 1 elements, CACCC boxes and potential GATA-1 binding 
sites. The availability of the CPX genomic sequence allowed us to determine the 
mutation in a patient with a hereditary coproporphyria. AG to A mutation was 
found at the last position of exon 6. This mutation results in exon skipping.
