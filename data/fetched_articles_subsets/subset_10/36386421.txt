BACKGROUND: Severe complications may cause a fatal or disabling outcome in 
patients with Rickettsia japonica infection but are poorly understood.
METHODS: We identified 11 patients with only Rickettsia japonica infection with 
metagenomics next generation sequencing (mNGS) during April to November 2021 at 
Yichang Central People's Hospital, China. Clinical data were obtained through 
review of medical records.
RESULTS: Most patients realized that they had symptoms about one or two days 
after being bitten. Fever (91%), pulmonary effusion (91%), rash or erythema 
(100%), abnormal urine (100%), neutropenia (100%), lymphopenia (100%), and 
thrombocytopenia (100%) were the most common clinical signs. Six severely ill 
patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and five had mild symptoms. 
Systemic manifestations such as vomiting (83%), neurological manifestations 
(100%), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (100%) were more frequently 
observed in the severe cases, 33.3% of whom developed purpura fulminans 
requiring amputation or skin graft, and 16.6% died two days after admission. 
Some patients experienced sequelae.
CONCLUSION: Our study found that patients with critical Rickettsia japonica 
infection complicating disseminated intravascular coagulation had high risk of 
poor outcome.
