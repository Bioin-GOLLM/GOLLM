Allergic diseases are distributed worldwide and their risk factors and triggers 
vary according to geographical and socioeconomic conditions. Allergies are 
frequent in the Tropics but aspects of their prevalence, natural history, risk 
factors, sensitizers and triggers are not well defined and some are expected to 
be different from those in temperate zone countries. The aim of this review is 
to investigate if allergic diseases in the Tropics have particularities that 
deserve special attention for research and clinical practice. Such information 
will help to form a better understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and 
management of allergic diseases in the Tropics. As expected, we found 
particularities in the Tropics that merit further study because they strongly 
affect the natural history of common allergic diseases; most of them related to 
climate conditions that favor permanent exposure to mite allergens, helminth 
infections and stinging insects. In addition, we detected several unmet needs in 
important areas which should be investigated and solved by collaborative efforts 
led by the emergent research groups on allergy from tropical countries.
