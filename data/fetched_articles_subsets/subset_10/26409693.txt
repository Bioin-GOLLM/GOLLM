BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) is a 
neurodegenerative disease that results in progressive muscle weakness and 
wasting. There is no known cure and the disease is uniformly fatal.
PURPOSE: This review discusses current concepts in ALS care, from breaking the 
diagnosis to end-of-life care. People with ALS have several multidisciplinary 
needs due to a complex and dynamic disease process. They benefit from 
rehabilitation interventions that are individualized and have the goal of 
optimizing independence, function, and safety. These strategies also help 
minimize symptomatic burden and maximize quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Patient-centered, multidisciplinary care has a significant impact on 
the life of people with ALS and is the current standard of care for this patient 
population.
