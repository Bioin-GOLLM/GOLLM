Alterations in cellular signaling pathways are associated with multiple disease 
states including cancers and fibrosis. Current research efforts to attenuate 
cancers, specifically lymphatic cancer, focus on inhibition of two sphingosine 
kinase isoforms, sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2). 
Determining differences in structural and physicochemical binding site 
properties of SphKs is attractive to refine inhibitor potency and isoform 
selectivity. This study utilizes a predictive in silico approach to determine 
key differences in binding sites in SphK isoforms in human and mouse species. 
Homology modeling, molecular docking of inhibitors, analysis of binding pocket 
residue positions, development of pharmacophore models, and analysis of binding 
cavity volume were performed to determine isoform- and species-selective 
characteristics of the binding site and generate a system to rank potential 
inhibitors. Interestingly, docking studies showed compounds bound to mouse SphK1 
in a manner more similar to human SphK2 than to human SphK1, indicating that 
SphKs in mice have structural properties distinct from humans that confounds 
prediction of ligand selectivity in mice. Our studies aid in the development and 
production of new compound classes by highlighting structural distinctions and 
identifying the role of key residues that cause observable, functional 
differences in isoforms and between orthologues.
