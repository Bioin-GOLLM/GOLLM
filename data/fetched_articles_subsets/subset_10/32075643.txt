BACKGROUND: Gain-of-function mutations in KIT are driver events of oncogenesis 
in mast cell tumours (MCTs) affecting companion animals. Somatic mutations of 
KIT determine the constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor 
leading to a worse prognosis and a shorter survival time than MCTs harbouring 
wild-type KIT. However, canine MCTs carrying KIT somatic mutations generally 
respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitors; hence their presence represents a 
predictor of treatment effectiveness, and its detection allows implementing a 
stratified medical approach. Despite this, veterinary oncologists experience 
treatment failures, even with targeted therapies whose cause cannot be 
elucidated. The first case of an MCT-affected dog caused by a secondary mutation 
in the tyrosine kinase domain responsible for resistance has recently been 
reported. The knowledge of this and all the other mutations responsible for 
resistance would allow the effective bedside implementation of a deeply 
stratified and more effective medical approach.
CASE PRESENTATION: The second case of a canine MCT carrying a different 
resistance mutation is herein described. The case was characterised by 
aggressive behaviour and early metastasis unresponsive to both vinblastine- and 
masitinib-based treatments. Molecular profiling of the tumoural masses revealed 
two different mutations; other than the already known activating mutation 
p.Asn508Ile in KIT exon 9, which is tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive, a 
nearly adjacent secondary missense mutation, p.Ala510Val, which had never before 
been described, was detected. In vitro transfection experiments showed that the 
secondary mutation did not cause the constitutive activation by itself but 
played a role in conferring resistance to masitinib.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the importance of the accurate molecular 
profiling of an MCT in order to improve understanding of the molecular mechanism 
underlying tumourigenesis and reveal chemoresistance in MCTs for more effective 
therapies. The detection of the somatic mutations responsible for resistance 
should be included in the molecular screening of MCTs, and a systematic analysis 
of all the cases characterised by unexpected refractoriness to therapies should 
be investigated in depth at both the genetic and the phenotypic level.
