In the title molecule, C(13)H(8)ClF(3)OS, the dihedral angle between the mean 
planes of 2-chloro-5-(trifluoro-meth-yl)phenyl and tiophene rings is 54.37 (5)°. 
The acethyl group is twisted by 8.1 (2)° with respect to the thio-phene ring. 
The CF(3) group is disordered over two sets of sites with occupations of 
0.49 (3) and 0.51 (3). The crystal packing features C-H⋯F and C-H⋯O hydrogen 
bonds, forming dimers which are connected into chains along the c axis by C-H⋯O 
hydrogen bonds and C-Cl⋯π [Cl⋯π = 3.415 (1) Å and C-Cl⋯π = 151.56 (5)°] 
inter-actions. The chains are further connected into layers perpendicular to the 
a axis by C-H⋯O inter-actions.
