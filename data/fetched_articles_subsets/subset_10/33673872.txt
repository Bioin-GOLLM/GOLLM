BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus, primarily transmitted by Aedes 
aegypti and Ae. albopictus. In late 2017-2018, an outbreak of chikungunya 
occurred in Mombasa county, Kenya, and investigations were conducted to 
establish associated entomological risk factors.
METHODS: Homes were stratified and water-filled containers inspected for 
immature Ae. aegypti, and larval indices were calculated. Adult mosquitoes were 
collected in the same homesteads using BG-Sentinel and CDC light traps and 
screened for chikungunya virus. Experiments were also conducted to determine the 
ability of Culex quinquefasciatus to transmit chikungunya virus.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one houses and 1637 containers were inspected; 48 
and 128 of them, respectively, were positive for immature Ae. aegypti, with the 
house index (36.60), container index (7.82) and Breteau index (97.71) recorded. 
Jerry cans (n = 1232; 72.26%) and clay pots (n = 2; 0.12%) were the most and 
least inspected containers, respectively, while drums, the second most commonly 
sampled (n = 249; 15.21%), were highly positive (65.63%) and productive (60%). 
Tires and jerry cans demonstrated the highest and lowest breeding preference 
ratios, 11.36 and 0.2, respectively. Over 6900 adult mosquitoes were collected 
and identified into 15 species comprising Cx. quinquefasciatus (n = 4492; 
65.04%), Aedes vittatus (n = 1137; 16.46%) and Ae. aegypti (n = 911; 13.19%) and 
2 species groups. Simpson's dominance and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices of 
0.4388 and 1.1942 were recorded, respectively. Chikungunya virus was isolated 
from pools of Ae. aegypti (1) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (4), two of which were 
males. Minimum infection rates of 3.0 and 0.8 were observed for female Ae. 
aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively. Between 25 and 31.3% of exposed 
mosquitoes became infected with CHIKV 7, 14 and 21 days post-exposure. For the 
experimentally infected Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, between 13 and 40% had 
the virus disseminated, with 100% transmission being observed among those with 
disseminated infection.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated high risk of chikungunya transmission 
for residents in the sampled areas of Mombasa. Transmission data confirmed the 
probable role played by Cx. quinquefasciatus in the outbreak while the role of 
Ae. vittatus in the transmission of chikungunya virus remains unknown.
