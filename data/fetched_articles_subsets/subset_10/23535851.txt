The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, has been widely used as a laboratory 
model for analyzing gene function. In this study, we established a novel cell 
line (Tc81) from T. castaneum embryos and validated the utility of this cell 
line by analyzing the juvenile hormone (JH) signaling pathway. In Tc81 cells, 
the Kr√ºppel homolog 1 gene (Kr-h1), which is a JH-dependent repressor of insect 
metamorphosis, was rapidly induced by subnanomolar levels of JHs. Bioinformatics 
analysis and reporter assays identified 2 JH response elements (kJHREs) located 
in the region upstream of the transcription start site and in the first intron 
of Kr-h1. Furthermore, methoprene tolerant (Met) and steroid receptor 
co-activator (SRC) RNAi reduced JH-dependent induction of Kr-h1 transcripts and 
kJHRE-reporter activities. Thus, this novel Tc81 cell line is useful for the 
elucidation of JH signaling and is a promising tool for the functional analysis 
of genes by RNAi and reporter assays.
