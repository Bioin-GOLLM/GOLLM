BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elevated total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) levels are 
known to be associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (IS). Given that 
both tHcy and IS are heritable traits, we investigated a potential genetic 
relationship between homocysteine levels and stroke risk by assessing 18 
polymorphisms previously associated with tHcy levels for their association with 
IS and its subtypes.
METHODS: Previous meta-analysis results from an international stroke 
collaborative network, METASTROKE, were used to assess association of the 18 
tHcy-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 389 IS cases and 62 
004 controls. We also investigated the associations in regions located within 50 
kb from the 18 tHcy-related SNPs and the association of a genetic risk score, 
including the 18 SNPs.
RESULTS: One SNP located in the RASIP1 gene and a cluster of 3 SNPs located at 
and near SLC17A3 were significantly associated with IS (P<0.0003) after 
correcting for multiple testing. For stroke subtypes, the sentinel SNP located 
upstream of MUT was significantly associated with small-vessel disease 
(P=0.0022), whereas 1 SNP located in MTHFR was significantly associated with 
large-vessel disease (P=0.00019). A genetic risk score, including the 18 SNPs, 
did not show significant association with IS or its subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found several potential associations with IS and its 
subtypes: an association of an MUT variant with small-vessel disease, an MTHFR 
variant with large-vessel disease, and associations of RASIP1 and SLC17A3 
variants with overall IS.
