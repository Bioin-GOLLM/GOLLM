Phenylketonuria (PKU, phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency), an inborn error of 
metabolism, can be detected through newborn screening for hyperphenylalaninemia 
(HPA). Most individuals with HPA harbor mutations in the gene encoding 
phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), and a small proportion (2%) exhibit 
tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency with additional neurotransmitter (dopamine 
and serotonin) deficiency. Here we report six individuals from four unrelated 
families with HPA who exhibited progressive neurodevelopmental delay, dystonia, 
and a unique profile of neurotransmitter deficiencies without mutations in PAH 
or BH4 metabolism disorder-related genes. In these six affected individuals, 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified biallelic mutations in DNAJC12, which 
encodes a heat shock co-chaperone family member that interacts with 
phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylases catalyzing the 
BH4-activated conversion of phenylalanine into tyrosine, tyrosine into L-dopa 
(the precursor of dopamine), and tryptophan into 5-hydroxytryptophan (the 
precursor of serotonin), respectively. DNAJC12 was undetectable in fibroblasts 
from the individuals with null mutations. PAH enzyme activity was reduced in the 
presence of DNAJC12 mutations. Early treatment with BH4 and/or neurotransmitter 
precursors had dramatic beneficial effects and resulted in the prevention of 
neurodevelopmental delay in the one individual treated before symptom onset. 
Thus, DNAJC12 deficiency is a preventable and treatable cause of intellectual 
disability that should be considered in the early differential diagnosis when 
screening results are positive for HPA. Sequencing of DNAJC12 may resolve any 
uncertainty and should be considered in all children with unresolved HPA.
