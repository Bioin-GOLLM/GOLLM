The endosperm of angiosperms is a zygotic seed organ that stores nutrient 
reserves to support embryogenesis and seed germination. Cereal endosperm is also 
a major source of human calories and an industrial feedstock. Maize opaque 
endosperm mutants commonly exhibit opaque, floury kernels, along with other 
abnormal seed and/or non-seed phenotypes. The opaque endosperm phenotype is 
sometimes accompanied by a soft kernel texture and increased nutritional 
quality, including a higher lysine content, which are valuable agronomic traits 
that have drawn attention of maize breeders. Recently, an increasing number of 
genes that underlie opaque mutants have been cloned, and their characterization 
has begun to shed light on the molecular basis of the opaque endosperm 
phenotype. These mutants are categorized by disruption of genes encoding zein or 
non-zein proteins localized to protein bodies, enzymes involved in endosperm 
metabolic processes, or transcriptional regulatory proteins associated with 
endosperm storage programs.
