The present article describes the first patient with a deficiency of 
ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) (Enzyme Commission number 5.3.1.6) who 
presented with leukoencephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Proton magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy of the brain revealed highly elevated levels of the 
polyols ribitol and D-arabitol, which were subsequently also found in high 
concentrations in body fluids. Deficient activity of RPI, one of the 
pentose-phosphate-pathway (PPP) enzymes, was demonstrated in fibroblasts. RPI 
gene-sequence analysis revealed a frameshift and a missense mutation. Recently, 
we described a patient with liver cirrhosis and abnormal polyol levels in body 
fluids, related to a deficiency of transaldolase, another enzyme in the PPP. RPI 
is the second known inborn error in the reversible phase of the PPP, confirming 
that defects in pentose and polyol metabolism constitute a new area of inborn 
metabolic disorders.
