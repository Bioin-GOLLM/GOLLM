The mol-ecule of the title Schiff base compound, C16H16N4O5S·C3H7NO, displays a 
trans conformation with respect to the C=N double bond. The C-N and N-N bonds 
are relatively short compared to their normal bond lengths, indicating some 
degree of delocalization in the mol-ecule. The mol-ecule is bent at the S atom, 
with an S-N-C-C torsion angle of 164.48 (11)°. The dihedral angle between the 
two aromatic rings is 84.594 (7)°. Inter-molecular N-H⋯O and C -H⋯O hydrogen 
bonds connect centrosymmetrically related mol-ecules into dimers forming rings 
of R33(11) and R22(10) graph-set motif stacked along the a axis into a columnar 
arrangement. The mol-ecular columns are further linked into a three-dimensional 
network by C-H⋯π inter-actions.
