The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide, and novel therapeutic 
strategies such as enhancement of thermogenic pathways in white adipose tissue 
(WAT) are gaining more attention. The gut/brain axis plays an essential role in 
promoting the browning of WAT. However, the mechanism by which this axis 
regulates WAT function is not fully understood. On the other hand, the role of 
microRNAs (miRNAs) in the control of WAT browning has already been established. 
Therefore, understanding the communication pathways linking the gut/brain axis 
and miRNAs might establish a promising intervention for obesity. Our published 
data showed that microRNA-204 (miR-204), a microRNA that plays an important role 
in the control of the central nervous system (CNS) and the pathogenesis of 
obesity, is affected by gut dysbiosis. Therefore, miR-204 could be a key element 
that controls the browning of WAT by acting as a potential link between the gut 
microbiota and the brain. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge 
about communication pathways between the brain, gut, and miR-204 and examined 
the literature to discuss potential research directions that might lead to a 
better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the browning of WAT in 
obesity.
