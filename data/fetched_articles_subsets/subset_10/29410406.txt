Serotonin receptors (5-HT3AR) directly regulate gut movement, and drugs that 
inhibit 5-HT3AR function are used to control emetic reflexes associated with 
gastrointestinal pathologies and cancer therapies. The 5-HT3AR function involves 
a finely tuned orchestration of three domain movements that include the 
ligand-binding domain, the pore domain, and the intracellular domain. Here, we 
present the structure from the full-length 5-HT3AR channel in the apo-state 
determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy at a nominal resolution 
of 4.3 Å. In this conformation, the ligand-binding domain adopts a conformation 
reminiscent of the unliganded state with the pore domain captured in a closed 
conformation. In comparison to the 5-HT3AR crystal structure, the full-length 
channel in the apo-conformation adopts a more expanded conformation of all the 
three domains with a characteristic twist that is implicated in gating.
