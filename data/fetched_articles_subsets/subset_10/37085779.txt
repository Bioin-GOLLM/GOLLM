BACKGROUND: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a 
curative therapy for hematologic malignancies and non-malignant disorders, such 
as aplastic anemia, fanconi anemia, and certain immune deficiencies. 
Post-transplantation kidney injury is a common complication and involves a wide 
spectrum of structural abnormalities, including glomerular (MSPGN, mesangial 
proliferative glomerulonephritis; FSGS, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis; 
MPGN, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; MCD, minimal change disease), 
vascular (TMA, thrombotic microangiopathy), and/or tubulointerstitial (TIN, 
tubulointerstitial nephritis; ATI, acute tubular injury). Renal biopsy is the 
gold-standard examination for defining multiple etiologies of kidney impairment. 
Although kidney injury following HSCT has been studied, little is known about 
the effects of allo-HSCT on renal pathology in pediatric patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed renal biopsy specimens from children with 
kidney injury after allo-HSCT and correlated results with clinical data in the 
last 10 years.
RESULTS: Among 25 children (18 males and 7 females), three patients had 
proteinuria indicating nephrotic syndrome (24-hour urinary total 
protein/weight > 50 mg/kg/d), nine patients had severely reduced estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2) and four patients received 
kidney replacement therapy (KRT). The main pathologies identified from kidney 
biopsies were MSPGN (n = 12), FSGS (n = 12), MPGN (n = 5), TMA (n = 4), MCD 
(n = 3), diffuse glomerular fibrosis (DGF, n = 2), ATI and TIN, in isolation or 
combined with other pathologies. The median follow-up time was 16.5 (0.5 ~ 68.0) 
months. Three patients died of recurrent malignancy and/or severe infection, one 
child developed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), six patients (24%) had 
elevated serum creatinine (SCr > 100µmol/l) and nine patients (36%) still had 
proteinuria.
CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates histomorphologic findings from kidney biopsies 
of pediatric recipients following allo-HSCT. Detailed evaluation of renal biopsy 
samples is helpful to elucidate the nature of renal insult, and may potentially 
identify treatable disease processes.
