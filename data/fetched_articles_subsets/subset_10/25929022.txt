In a consultative and diagnostic center "Healthy Nutrition" of Institute of 
Nutrition the nutritional status of 3500 patients (mean age 48.4 Â± 0.3 years) 
liv- ing in the Moscow region, using a system Nutritest IP-3, including genomic 
analysis has been examined. In the analysis of dietary intake by an average 
review, increased energy intake due to excess intake of the total (44.2% energy) 
and saturated fat (13.6%) has been shown. 30.0% of patients were overweight and 
34.1% were obese. Osteopenia was detected in 31.0% of men and 25.0% women, 
osteoporosis--20.9% and 30.3%, respectively. Analysis of the results of 
biochemical studies revealed increased cholesterol in 68.7% of patients, LDL 
cholesterol--at 63.9%, triglycerides-- at 22.5%, glucose--at 29.4%. The 
frequency of the occurrence of risk alleles of genes associated with the 
development of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus was: 47.8%--for the 
polymorphism rs9939609 (FTO gene), 8.3%--for polymorphism rs4994 (gene ADRB3), 
60.2%--for the polymorphism rs659366 (gene UCP2), 36.6%--for the rs5219 
polymorphism in the gene of ATP-dependent potassium channel.
