BACKGROUND: The most critical point in the treatment of prostate cancer is the 
progression towards a hormone-refractory tumour, making research on alternative 
therapies necessary. This study focused on the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine 
(SAM), which is known to act as an antitumourigenic in several cancer cell 
lines. Though a genome-wide downregulation of proto-oncogenes in prostate cancer 
cell lines treated with SAM is obvious, the anticancer effects remain elusive. 
Thus, in this study, the impact of SAM treatment on the cell cycle, apoptosis 
and cancer-related pathways was investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: After performing SAM treatment on prostate cancer cell 
lines (PC-3 and DU145), a cell-cycle arrest during the S-phase, a downregulation 
of cyclin A protein levels and an upregulation of p21 cell cycle inhibitor were 
observed. The proapoptotic Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the caspase-3 activity were 
elevated; additionally, the apoptosis rate of SAM treated cells increased 
significantly in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, immunoblots displayed a 
downregulation of Erk1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation accompanied by a reduced 
expression of the STAT3 protein.
CONCLUSION: SAM caused changes in cancer-related pathways, probably leading to 
the effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis rate. These results provide deeper 
insights into the anticancer effects of SAM on prostate cancer cells.
