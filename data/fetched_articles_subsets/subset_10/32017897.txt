Post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate the stability and, hence, expression of 
coding and noncoding RNAs. Sequence-specific features within the 3' untranslated 
region (3' UTR) often direct mRNAs for decay. Here, we characterize a 
genome-wide RNA decay pathway that reduces the half-lives of mRNAs based on 
overall 3' UTR structure formed by base pairing. The decay pathway is 
independent of specific single-stranded sequences, as regulation is maintained 
in both the original and reverse complement orientation. Regulation can be 
compromised by reducing the overall structure by fusing the 3' UTR with an 
unstructured sequence. Mutating base-paired RNA regions can also compromise 
this structure-mediated regulation, which can be restored by re-introducing 
base-paired structures of different sequences. The decay pathway requires the 
RNA-binding protein UPF1 and its associated protein G3BP1. Depletion of either 
protein increased steady-state levels of mRNAs with highly structured 3' UTRs as 
well as highly structured circular RNAs. This structure-dependent mechanism 
therefore enables cells to selectively regulate coding and noncoding RNAs.
