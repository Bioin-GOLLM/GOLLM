BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis associated with germline KIT activating mutations is 
exceedingly rare. We report the unique clinicopathologic features of a patient 
with systemic mastocytosis caused by a de novo germline KIT K509I mutation.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the effect of the germline KIT K509I 
mutation on human mast cell development and function.
METHODS: Primary human mast cells derived from CD34(+) peripheral blood 
progenitors were examined for growth, development, survival, and IgE-mediated 
activation. In addition, a mast cell transduction system that stably expressed 
the KIT K509I mutation was established.
RESULTS: KIT K509I biopsied mast cells were round, CD25(-), and well 
differentiated. KIT K509I progenitors cultured in stem cell factor (SCF) 
demonstrated a 10-fold expansion compared with progenitors from healthy subjects 
and developed into mature hypergranular mast cells with enhanced 
antigen-mediated degranulation. KIT K509I progenitors cultured in the absence of 
SCF survived but lacked expansion and developed into hypogranular mast cells. A 
KIT K509I mast cell transduction system revealed SCF-independent survival to be 
reliant on the preferential splicing of KIT at the adjacent exonic junction.
CONCLUSION: Germline KIT mutations associated with mastocytosis drive a 
well-differentiated mast cell phenotype distinct to that of somatic KIT D816V 
disease, the oncogenic potential of which might be influenced by SCF and 
selective KIT splicing.
