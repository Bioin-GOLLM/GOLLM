Recently, genome-editing technology like clustered regularly interspaced short 
palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 has improved the translational gap in the 
treatments mediated through gene therapy. The advantages of the CRISPR system, 
such as, work in the living cells and tissues, candidate this technique for the 
employing in experiments and the therapy of central nervous system diseases. 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a widespread, disabling, neurodegenerative disease 
induced by dopaminergic neuron loss and linked to progressive motor impairment. 
Pathophysiological basis knowledge of PD has modified the PD classification 
model and expresses in the sporadic and familial types. Analyses of the earliest 
genetic linkage have shown in PD the inclusion of synuclein alpha (SNCA) genomic 
duplication and SNCA mutations in the familial types of PD pathogenesis. This 
review analyzes the structure, development, and function in genome editing 
regulated through the CRISPR/Cas9. Also, it explains the genes associated with 
PD pathogenesis and the appropriate modifications to favor PD. This study 
follows the direction by understanding the PD linking analyses in which the 
CRISPR technique is applied. Finally, this study explains the limitations and 
future trends of CRISPR service in relation to the genome-editing process in PD 
patients' induced pluripotent stem cells.
