The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and 
CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) (CRISPR/Cas9) system is a powerful tool that 
enables precise and efficient gene manipulation. In a relatively short time, 
CRISPR has risen to become the preferred gene-editing system due to its high 
efficiency, simplicity, and programmability at low costs. Furthermore, in the 
recent years, the CRISPR toolkit has been rapidly expanding, and the emerging 
advancements have shown tremendous potential in uncovering molecular mechanisms 
and new therapeutic strategies for human diseases. In this review, we provide 
our perspectives on the recent advancements in CRISPR technology and its impact 
on precision medicine, ranging from target identification, disease modeling, and 
diagnostics. We also discuss the impact of novel approaches such as epigenome, 
base, and prime editing on preclinical cancer drug discovery.
