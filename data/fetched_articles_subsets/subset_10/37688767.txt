OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex autoimmune disorder, and 
evidence supports the significance of genetic polymorphisms in SLE genetic 
susceptibility. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of BTN3A1 
(butyrophilin 3A1), SHP2 (Src homology-2 containing protein tyrosine 
phosphatase), CD274 (programmed cell death 1 ligand 1), and STAT3 (signal 
transducer-activator of transcription 3) gene interactions on SLE risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and ninety patients diagnosed with SLE and 
370 healthy controls were recruited. A multifactor dimensionality reduction 
(MDR) approach was used to determine the epistasis among single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) on the BTN3A1 (rs742090), SHP2 (rs58116261), CD174 
(rs702275), and STAT3 (rs8078731) genes. The best risk prediction model was 
identified in terms of precision and cross-validation consistency.
RESULTS: Allele A and genotype AA were negatively related to genetic 
susceptibility of SLE for BTN3A1 rs742090 (OR = 0.788 (0.625-0.993), P = 0.044; 
OR = 0.604 (0.372-0.981), P = 0.040). For STAT3 rs8078731, allele A and genotype 
AA were positively related to the risk of SLE (OR = 1.307 (1.032-1.654), 
P = 0.026; OR = 1.752 (1.020-3.010), P = 0.041). MDR analysis revealed the most 
significant interaction between BTN3A1 rs742090 and SHP2 rs58116261. The best 
risk prediction model was a combination of BTN3A1 rs742090, SHP2 rs58116261, and 
STAT3 rs8078731 (accuracy = 0.5866, consistency = 10/10, OR = 1.9870 
(1.5964-2.4731), P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: These data indicate that risk prediction models formed by gene 
interactions (BTN3A1, SHP2, STAT3) can identify susceptible populations of SLE. 
Key Points • BTN3A1 rs742090 polymorphism was a protective factor for systemic 
lupus erythematosus, while STAT3 rs8078731 polymorphism was a risk factor. • 
There was a strong synergistic effect of BTN3A1 rs742090 and SHP2 rs58116261, 
and interaction among BTN3A1 rs742090, SHP2 rs58116261, and STAT3 rs8078731 
constructed the best model to show association with SLE risk.
