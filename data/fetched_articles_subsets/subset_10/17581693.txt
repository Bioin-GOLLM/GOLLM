A large proportion of recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss is due to mutations in 
the GJB2 gene encoding connexin 26 (Cx26), a component of a gap junction. Within 
different ethnic groups there are specific common recessive mutations, each with 
a relatively high carrier frequency, suggesting the possibility of heterozygous 
advantage. Carriers of the R143W GJB2 allele, the most prevalent in the African 
population, present with a thicker epidermis than noncarriers. In this study, we 
show that (R143W)Cx26-expressing keratinocytes form a significantly thicker 
epidermis in an organotypic coculture skin model. In addition, we show increased 
migration of cells expressing (R143W)Cx26 compared to (WT)Cx26-overexpressing 
cells. We also demonstrate that cells expressing (R143W)Cx26 are significantly 
less susceptible to cellular invasion by the enteric pathogen Shigella flexneri 
than (WT)Cx26-expressing cells. These in vitro studies suggest an advantageous 
effect of (R143W)Cx26 in epithelial cells.
