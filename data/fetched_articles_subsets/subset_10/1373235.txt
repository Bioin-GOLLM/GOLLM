A large proportion of mutations at the human hprt locus result in aberrant 
splicing of the hprt mRNA. We have been able to relate the mutation to the 
splicing abnormality in 30 of these mutants. Mutations at the splice acceptor 
sites of introns 4, 6 and 7 result in splicing out of the whole of the 
downstream exons, whereas in introns 1, 7 or 8 a cryptic site in the downstream 
exon can be used. Mutations in the donor site of introns 1 and 5 result in the 
utilisation of cryptic sites further downstream, whereas in the other introns, 
the upstream exons are spliced out. Our most unexpected findings were mutations 
in the middle of exons 3 and 8 which resulted in splicing out of these exons in 
part of the mRNA populations. Our results have enabled us to assess current 
models of mRNA splicing. They emphasize the importance of the polypyrimidine 
tract in splice acceptor sites, they support the role of the exon as the unit of 
assembly for splicing, and they are consistent with a model proposing a 
stem-loop structure for exon 8 in the hprt mRNA.
