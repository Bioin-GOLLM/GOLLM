Although oligodendrocytes undergo apoptosis after spinal cord injury, molecular 
mechanisms responsible for their death have been unknown. We report that 
oligodendrocyte apoptosis is regulated oppositely by c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 
(JNK3) and protein interacting with the mitotic kinase, never in mitosis A I 
(Pin1), the actions of which converge on myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 
(Mcl-1). Activated after injury, JNK3 induces cytochrome c release by 
facilitating the degradation of Mcl-1, the stability of which is maintained in 
part by Pin1. Pin1 binds Mcl-1 at its constitutively phosphorylated site, 
Thr163Pro, and stabilizes it by inhibiting ubiquitination. After injury JNK3 
phosphorylates Mcl-1 at Ser121Pro, facilitating the dissociation of Pin1 from 
Mcl-1. JNK3 thus induces Mcl-1 degradation by counteracting the protective 
binding of Pin1. These results are confirmed by the opposing phenotypes observed 
between JNK3-/- and Pin1-/- mice: oligodendrocyte apoptosis and cytochrome c 
release are reduced in JNK3-/- but elevated in Pin1-/- mice. This report thus 
unveils a mechanism by which cytochrome c release is under the opposite control 
of JNK3 and Pin1, regulators for which the activities are intricately coupled.
