OBJECTIVE: Central giant cell lesion (CGCL) and giant cell tumour (GCT) are bone 
lesions that share similar microscopic features. Recently, it was reported that 
90% of bone GCT exhibit either p.Gly34 Trp or p.Gly34 Leu in H3F3A, one of two 
genes for histone H3.3 located on chromosome 1. We aimed to test whether 
sporadic CGCL of the jaws share the H3F3A mutations reported in GCT of other 
bones.
METHODS: Nine samples of CGCL of the jaws were included in the study, and 
mutations were assessed by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: None of the CGCL samples presented the recurrent p.Gly34 Trp or p.Gly34 
Leu mutations in the H3F3A gene.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of our findings, H3F3A p.Gly34 Trp or p.Gly34 Leu 
mutations are not a frequent event in CGCL. If these alterations are confirmed 
to be exclusive of GCT, the assessment of H3F3A mutations may help in the 
differential diagnosis of GCT and CGCL of the jaws.
