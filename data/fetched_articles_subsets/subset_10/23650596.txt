GTPases are important regulatory proteins that hydrolyze GTP to GDP. A novel 
GTP-hydrolysis mechanism is employed by MnmE, YqeH and FeoB, where a potassium 
ion plays a role analogous to the Arginine finger of the Ras-RasGAP system, to 
accelerate otherwise slow GTP hydrolysis rates. In these proteins, two conserved 
asparagines and a 'K-loop' present in switch-I, were suggested as attributes of 
GTPases employing a K(+)-mediated mechanism. Based on their conservation, a 
similar mechanism was suggested for TEES family GTPases. Recently, in Dynamin, 
Fzo1 and RbgA, which also conserve these attributes, a similar mechanism was 
shown to be operative. Here, we probe K(+)-activated GTP hydrolysis in TEES 
(TrmE-Era-EngA-YihA-Septin) GTPases - Era, EngB and the two contiguous 
G-domains, GD1 and GD2 of YphC (EngA homologue) - and also in HflX, another 
GTPase that also conserves the same attributes. While GD1-YphC and Era exhibit a 
K(+)-mediated activation of GTP hydrolysis, surprisingly GD2-YphC, EngB and HflX 
do not. Therefore, the attributes identified thus far, do not necessarily 
predict a K(+)-mechanism in GTPases and hence warrant extensive structural 
investigations.
