Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative 
agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues to wreak havoc, 
threatening the public health services and imposing economic collapse worldwide. 
Tailoring public health responses to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic depends on 
understanding the mechanism of viral replication, disease pathogenesis, 
accurately identifying acute infections, and mapping the spreading risk of 
hotspots across the globe. However, effective identification and isolation of 
persons with asymptomatic and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections remain the major 
obstacles to efforts in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread and hence the 
pandemic. Understanding the mechanism of persistent viral shedding, reinfection, 
and the post-acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is crucial in our 
efforts to combat the pandemic and provide better care and rehabilitation to 
survivors. Here, we present a living literature review (January 2020 through 15 
March 2021) on SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence, reinfection, and PASC. We also 
highlight potential areas of research to uncover putative links between viral 
persistence, intra-host evolution, host immune status, and protective immunity 
to guide and direct future basic science and clinical research priorities.
