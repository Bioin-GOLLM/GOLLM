BACKGROUND: Stimulated thyroglobulin levels measured at the time of remnant 
ablation (A-hTg) and BRAFV600E mutation had shown prognostic value in predicting 
persistent disease in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the prognostic role of A-hTg combined with the BRAFV600E status 
in association with the revised American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk 
stratification.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 620 patients treated for a DTC were included in this study 
with a median follow-up duration of 6.1 years. All patients underwent total 
thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine ablation. Patients with positive 
anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were excluded. The predictive value of A-hTg was 
calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) analysis. The 
Cox proportional hazard regression model, including the BRAF status, A-hTg, and 
ATA classification system, was assessed to evaluate the existing persistent 
disease risk.
RESULTS: Taken together, the BRAF status and A-hTg levels improve the ATA risk 
classification in all categories. In particular, in the low-risk ATA 
classification, only the combination of BRAFV600E+A-hTg > 8.9ng/ml was 
associated with persistent disease (P = 0.001, HR 60.2, CI 95% 5.28-687). In the 
intermediate-risk ATA classification, BRAFWT+A-hTg > 8.9ng/ml was associated 
with persistent disease (P = 0.029, HR 2.71, CI 95% 1.106-6.670) and 
BRAFV600E+A-hTg > 8.9ng/ml was also associated with persistent disease (P < 
0.001, HR 5.001, CI 95% 2.318-10.790). In the high-risk ATA classification, both 
BRAFV600E+A-hTg < 8.9ng/ml and BRAFV600E+A-hTg > 8.9 ng/ml were associated with 
persistent disease (P = 0.042, HR 5.963, CI 95% 1.069-33.255 and P = 0.002, HR 
11.564, CI 95% 2.543-52.576, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The BRAF status and stimulated thyroglobulin levels at ablation 
time improve the ATA risk stratification of differentiated thyroid cancer; 
therefore, even A-hTg could be included in risk classification factors.
