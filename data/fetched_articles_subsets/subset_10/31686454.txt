AIM: To determine whether serum ferritin, liver transaminases, and regularity 
and type of iron chelation protocol can be used to predict liver iron load as 
assessed by T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with beta 
thalassemia major (TM).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study, conducted from March 1, 2014 to March 1, 
2015, involved 90 patients with beta TM on regular packed red blood cell 
transfusion. Liver and cardiac iron load were evaluated with T2* MRI. Compliance 
with iron-chelating agents, deferoxamine or deferasirox, and regularity of their 
use, as well as serum ferritin and liver transaminase levels were assessed.
RESULTS: Patients with high serum ferritin were 2.068 times (95% confidence 
interval 1.26-3.37) more likely to have higher liver or cardiac iron load. High 
serum aspartate aminotransferases and irregular use of iron chelating agents, 
but not their type, predicted higher cardiac iron load. In a multiple regression 
model, serum ferritin level was the only significant predictor of liver and 
myocardial iron load.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum ferritin strongly predicted the severity of cardiac 
and liver iron load. Irregular use of chelator drugs was associated with a 
higher risk of cardiac and liver iron load, regardless of the type of chelating 
agent.
