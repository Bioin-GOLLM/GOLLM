Dietary protein dilution (DPD) promotes metabolic-remodelling and -health but 
the precise nutritional components driving this response remain elusive. Here, 
by mimicking amino acid (AA) supply from a casein-based diet, we demonstrate 
that restriction of dietary essential AA (EAA), but not non-EAA, drives the 
systemic metabolic response to total AA deprivation; independent from dietary 
carbohydrate supply. Furthermore, systemic deprivation of threonine and 
tryptophan, independent of total AA supply, are both adequate and necessary to 
confer the systemic metabolic response to both diet, and genetic AA-transport 
loss, driven AA restriction. Dietary threonine restriction (DTR) retards the 
development of obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction. Liver-derived 
fibroblast growth factor 21 is required for the metabolic remodelling with DTR. 
Strikingly, hepatocyte-selective establishment of threonine biosynthetic 
capacity reverses the systemic metabolic response to DTR. Taken together, our 
studies of mice demonstrate that the restriction of EAA are sufficient and 
necessary to confer the systemic metabolic effects of DPD.
