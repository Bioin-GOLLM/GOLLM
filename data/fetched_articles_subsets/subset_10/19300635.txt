There is a growing body of literature supporting the contribution of genetic 
variability to the mechanisms responsible for the adverse effects of 
antipsychotic medications particularly movement disorders and weight gain. 
Despite the current gap between research studies and the practical tools 
available to the clinician to identify such risks, it is hoped that in the 
foreseeable future, pharmacogenetics will become a critical aid to guide the 
development of personalized therapeutic regimes with fewer adverse effects. We 
provide a summary of two cases that are examples of using cytochrome P450 
pharmacogenetics in an attempt to guide treatment in the context of recent 
literature concerning the role of pharmacogenetics in the manifestation of 
adverse effects of antipsychotic therapies. These examples and the review of 
recent literature on pharmacogenetics of antipsychotic adverse effects 
illustrate the potential for applying the principles of predictive, preventive, 
and personalized medicine to the therapy of psychotic disorders.
