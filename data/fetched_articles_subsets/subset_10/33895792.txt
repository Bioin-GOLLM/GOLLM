Ferroportin (FPN), the body's sole iron exporter, is essential for maintaining 
systemic iron homeostasis. In response to either increased iron or inflammation, 
hepatocyte-secreted hepcidin binds to FPN, inducing its internalization and 
subsequent degradation. However, the E3 ubiquitin ligase that underlies FPN 
degradation has not been identified. Here, we report the identification and 
characterization of a novel mechanism involving the RNF217-mediated degradation 
of FPN. A combination of 2 different E3 screens revealed that the Rnf217 gene is 
a target of Tet1, mediating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of 
FPN. Interestingly, loss of Tet1 expression causes an accumulation of FPN and an 
impaired response to iron overload, manifested by increased iron accumulation in 
the liver together with decreased iron in the spleen and duodenum. Moreover, we 
found that the degradation and ubiquitination of FPN could be attenuated by 
mutating RNF217. Finally, using 2 conditional knockout mouse lines, we found 
that knocking out Rnf217 in macrophages increases splenic iron export by 
stabilizing FPN, whereas knocking out Rnf217 in intestinal cells appears to 
increase iron absorption. These findings suggest that the Tet1-RNF217-FPN axis 
regulates iron homeostasis, revealing new therapeutic targets for FPN-related 
diseases.
