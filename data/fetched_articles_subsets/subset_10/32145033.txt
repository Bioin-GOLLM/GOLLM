Litomosoides sigmodontis is the only filarial nematode where the full life 
cycle, from larval delivery to the skin through to circulating microfilaria, can 
be completed in immunocompetent laboratory mice. It is thus an invaluable tool 
for the study of filariasis. It has been used for the study of novel 
anti-helminthic therapeutics, the development of vaccines against filariasis, 
the development of immunomodulatory drugs for the treatment of inflammatory 
disease and the study of basic immune responses to filarial nematodes. This 
review will focus on the latter and aims to summarize how the L sigmodontis 
model has advanced our basic understanding of immune responses to helminths, led 
to major discoveries in macrophage biology and provided new insights into the 
immunological functions of the pleural cavity. Finally, and most importantly 
L sigmodontis represents a suitable platform to study how host genotype affects 
immune responses, with the potential for further discovery in myeloid cell 
biology and beyond.
