TKFC-encoded triokinase catalyses glyceraldehyde phosphorylation in fructose 
metabolism and favours lipogenesis in mice. In Tkfc knockouts or knockdowns, 
fructose oxidation predominates over lipogenesis. The highly prevalent human 
variant Ala185Thr-Triokinase/FMN cyclase (TKFC) has been reported to be 'null' 
for fructose metabolism, since Ala185-TKFC rescues the mouse TKFC-deficient 
phenotype, whereas Ala185Thr-TKFC does not. Such report implies that most humans 
would display a noncanonical fructose metabolism, but it ignores the 
well-characterized triokinase activity of Ala185Thr-TKFC. Here, earlier evidence 
is summarized, along with new evidence that both human variants are equally 
active in yeast. Therefore, future research on triokinase in the context of 
human fructose metabolism should consider that Ala185Thr-TKFC is not 
biochemically 'null'.
