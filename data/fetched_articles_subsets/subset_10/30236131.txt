There is a constant need to improve antiretrovirals against HIV since therapy is 
limited by cost, side effects and the emergence of drug resistance. Kudzu is a 
climbing vine from which the root extract (Pueraria lobata), rich in isoflavones 
and saponins, has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for a variety 
of purposes, from weight loss to alcoholism prevention. Here we show that Kudzu 
root extract significantly inhibits HIV-1 entry into cell lines, primary human 
CD4+T lymphocytes and macrophages, without cell-associated toxicity. 
Specifically, Kudzu inhibits the initial attachment of the viral particle to the 
cell surface, a mechanism that depends on the envelope glycoprotein gp120 but is 
independent from the HIV-1 cell receptor CD4 and co-receptors CXCR4/CCR5. This 
activity seems selective to lentiviruses since Kudzu inhibits HIV-2 and simian 
immunodeficiency virus, but does not interfere with Hepatitis C, Influenza, Zika 
Brazil and adenovirus infection. Importantly, depending on the dose, Kudzu can 
act synergistically or additively with the current antiretroviral cocktails 
against HIV-1 and can block   viruses resistant to the fusion inhibitor 
Enfuvirtide. Together our results highlight Kudzu's root extract value as a 
supplement to current antiretroviral therapy against HIV.
