Protozoan diseases continue to be a worldwide social and economic health 
problem. Increased drug resistance, emerging cross resistance, and lack of new 
drugs with novel mechanisms of action significantly reduce the effectiveness of 
current antiprotozoal therapies. While drug resistance associated to 
anti-infective agents is a reality, society seems to remain unaware of its 
proportions and consequences. Parasites usually develops ingenious and 
innovative mechanisms to achieve drug resistance, which requires more research 
and investment to fight it. In this review, drug resistance developed by 
protozoan parasites Plasmodium, Leishmania, and Trypanosoma will be discussed.
