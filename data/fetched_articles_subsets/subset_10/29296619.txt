The clinical phenotypes of human CoQ10-deficiency caused by COQ2 mutations range 
from fatal neonatal disease to adult-onset multisystem atrophy. So far, 
treatment options for these diseases are unsatisfactory. Here, we demonstrate 
that supplementation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) fully restores endogenous 
CoQ10-biosynthesis in COQ2-deficient cell lines. This was accompanied by 
increased protein expression of CoQ10-biosynthesis-enzymes as well as a rescue 
of cell viability during stress conditions. In silico analysis suggested a 
ligand transportation path for 4-HBA through the COQ2 protein towards the 
mitochondrial matrix side. This process is apparently hindered by 
disease-causing mutations, which can be overcome by increasing 4-HBA 
concentrations.
