BACKGROUND: Skeletomuscular diseases result in significant muscle loss and 
decreased performance, paralleled by a loss in mitochondrial and oxidative 
capacity. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are two potent 
anabolic hormones that activate a host of signalling intermediates including the 
serine/threonine kinase AKT to influence skeletal muscle physiology. Defective 
AKT signalling is associated with muscle pathology, including cachexia, 
sarcopenia, and disuse; however, the mechanistic underpinnings remain 
unresolved.
METHODS: To elucidate the role of AKT signalling in muscle mass and physiology, 
we generated both congenital and inducible mouse models of skeletal 
muscle-specific AKT deficiency. To understand the downstream mechanisms 
mediating AKT's effects on muscle biology, we generated mice lacking AKT1/2 and 
FOXO1 (M-AKTFOXO1TKO and M-indAKTFOXO1TKO) to inhibit downstream FOXO1 
signalling, AKT1/2 and TSC1 (M-AKTTSCTKO and M-indAKTTSCTKO) to activate mTORC1, 
and AKT1/2, FOXO1, and TSC1 (M-QKO and M-indQKO) to simultaneously activate 
mTORC1 and inhibit FOXO1 in AKT-deficient skeletal muscle. Muscle proteostasis 
and physiology were assessed using multiple assays including metabolic 
labelling, mitochondrial function, fibre typing, ex vivo physiology, and 
exercise performance.
RESULTS: Here, we show that genetic ablation of skeletal muscle AKT signalling 
resulted in decreased muscle mass and a loss of oxidative metabolism and muscle 
performance. Specifically, deletion of muscle AKT activity during development or 
in adult mice resulted in a significant reduction in muscle growth by 30-40% 
(P  < 0.0001; n = 12-20) and 15% (P < 0.01 and P < 0.0001; n = 20-30), 
respectively. Interestingly, this reduction in muscle mass was primarily due to 
an ~40% reduction in protein synthesis in both M-AKTDKO and M-indAKTDKO muscles 
(P < 0.05 and P < 0.01; n = 12-20) without significant changes in proteolysis or 
autophagy. Moreover, a significant reduction in oxidative capacity was observed 
in both M-AKTDKO (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001; n = 5-12) and M-indAKTDKO 
(P < 0.05 and P < 0.01; n = 4). Mechanistically, activation and inhibition of 
mTORC1/FOXO1, respectively, but neither alone, were sufficient to restore 
protein synthesis, muscle oxidative capacity, and muscle function in the absence 
of AKT in vivo. In a mouse model of disuse-induced muscle loss, simultaneous 
activation of mTORC1 and inhibition of FOXO1 preserved muscle mass following 
immobilization (~5-10% reduction in casted M-indFOXO1TSCDKO muscles vs. ~30-40% 
casted M-indControl muscles, P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001; n = 8-16).
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this study provides novel insights into the 
AKT-dependent mechanisms that underlie muscle protein homeostasis, function, and 
metabolism in both normal physiology and disuse-induced muscle wasting.
