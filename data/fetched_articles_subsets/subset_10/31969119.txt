BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB) is a retinal degenerative 
disorder caused by BEST1 mutations with autosomal recessive inheritance. We aim 
to map a comprehensive genomic and metabolomic profile of a consanguineous 
Chinese family with ARB.
METHODS: Ophthalmic examinations were performed on the affected patients with 
ARB. The proband was screened for potential causative mutations in a panel with 
256 known retinal disease genes by using target capture sequencing. The related 
mutation was further validated and segregated in the family members by Sanger 
sequencing. In silico prediction tools were used for pathogenicity assessment. A 
UHPLC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis was performed to explore the disease-associated 
metabolic feature.
RESULTS: The affected patients from this family were characterized by low 
vision, the presence of subretinal fluid, macular edema, and hyperopia with 
coincidental angle closure. DNA sequencing identified a novel missense mutation 
in the BEST1 gene c.646G > A (p.Val216Ile) of the proband. Sanger sequencing 
further confirmed the mutation. The missense mutation was co-segregation across 
the pedigree and predicted to be deleterious by SIFT (0.017). The blood 
metabolic profiles were highly similar among all family members probably because 
of the same lifestyle, habitat and genomic background. However, ARB patients 
presented a significant deregulation of metabolites, such as citric acid, 
L-Threonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel disease-associated variant in the BEST1 gene 
as well as a disease-specific metabolic feature in familial ARB. Our findings 
helped improve the understanding of ARB mechanisms.
