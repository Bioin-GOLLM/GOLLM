INTRODUCTION: Hypo-high-density lipoprotein cholesterolemia (hypo-HDL-C) 
contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases. The hypothesis that 
the polygenic variants associated with hypo-HDL-C interact with lifestyle 
factors was examined in 58,701 middle-aged Korean adults who participated in the 
Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES).
METHODS: Participants were categorized into the Low-HDL (case; n = 16,980) and 
Normal-HDL (n = 41,721) groups. The participants in the Low-HDL group were 
selected using the guideline-based cutoffs for hypo-HDL-C (<40 mg/dL for men 
and < 50 mg/dL for women) and included those taking medication for dyslipidemia. 
The genes associated with hypo-HDL-C were determined through a genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) in a city hospital-based cohort, and the results were 
validated in the Ansan/Anung study. The genetic variants for the single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-SNP interaction were selected using a generalized 
multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis, and the polygenic risk score 
(PRS) generated was evaluated for interaction with lifestyle parameters.
RESULTS: The participants with hypo-HDL-C showed a 1.45 and 1.36-fold higher 
association with myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. The High-PRS 
with four SNPs, namely ZPR1_rs3741297, CETP_rs708272, BUD13_rs180327, and 
ALDH1A2_rs588136, and that with the 11q23.3 haplotype were positively associated 
with hypo-HDL-C by about 3 times, which was a 2.4-fold higher association than 
the PRS of 24 SNP with p < 5×10-8. The risk alleles of CETP_rs708272 and 
ALDH1A2_rs588136 were linked to increased expression in the heart and decreased 
in the brain, respectively. The selected SNPs were linked to the reverse 
cholesterol transport pathway, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle remodeling 
pathway, cholesterol storage, and macrophage-derived foam cell differentiation 
regulation. The PRS of the 4-SNP model interacted with energy intake and smoking 
status, while that of the haplotype interacted with a glycemic index of the 
diet, sulfur microbial diet, and smoking status.
DISCUSSION: Adults with a genetic risk for hypo-HDL-C need to modulate their 
diet and smoking status to reduce their risk.
