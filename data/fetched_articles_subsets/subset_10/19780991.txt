BACKGROUND: Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene has emerged as a 
potential susceptibility gene for non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCL/P) 
in different populations. The aim of this study was to determine the association 
of IRF6 rs2235371 and rs642961 polymorphisms with NSCL/P in a Brazilian 
population.
METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-eight patients affected by NSCL/P and 126 
healthy individuals were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay.
RESULTS: Overall genotype distributions of rs2235371 and rs642961 polymorphisms 
were as expected by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. The rs2235371 polymorphic 
genotype GA was identified in 10.1% of the patients with NSCL/P and in 10.3% of 
the control group, revealing no statistical difference. Similarly, the frequency 
of rs642961 minor genotypes (GA and AA) was quite similar between control group 
(28.6%) and NSCL/P group (25.4%), without significant difference.
CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with a lack of involvement of IRF6 
rs2235371 and rs642961 polymorphisms in the NSCL/P pathogenesis in the Brazilian 
population.
