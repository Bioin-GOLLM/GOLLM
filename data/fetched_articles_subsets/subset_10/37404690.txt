Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) have a slow onset and are usually detected late 
during disease. NDs are often difficult to cure due to the presence of the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB), which makes it difficult to find effective treatments 
and drugs, causing great stress and financial burden to families and society. 
Currently, small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are the most promising drug 
delivery systems (DDSs) for targeted delivery of molecules to specific sites in 
the brain as a therapeutic vehicle due to their low toxicity, low 
immunogenicity, high stability, high delivery efficiency, high biocompatibility 
and trans-BBB functionality. Here, we review the therapeutic application of sEVs 
in several NDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and 
Huntington's disease, discuss the current barriers associated with sEVs and 
brain-targeted DDS, and suggest future research directions.
