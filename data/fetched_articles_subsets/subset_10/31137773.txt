Ion channels and transporters play essential roles in excitable cells including 
cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle cells, neurons, and endocrine cells. In 
pancreatic beta-cells, for example, potassium KATP channels link the metabolic 
signals generated inside the cell to changes in the beta-cell membrane 
potential, and ultimately regulate insulin secretion. Mutations in the genes 
encoding some ion transporter and channel proteins lead to disorders of glucose 
homeostasis (hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and different forms of diabetes 
mellitus). Pancreatic KATP, Non-KATP, and some calcium channelopathies and MCT1 
transporter defects can lead to various forms of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia 
(HH). Mutations in the genes encoding the pancreatic KATP channels can also lead 
to different types of diabetes (including neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and 
Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young, MODY), and defects in the solute carrier 
family 2 member 2 (SLC2A2) leads to diabetes mellitus as part of the 
Fanconi-Bickel syndrome. Variants or polymorphisms in some ion channel genes and 
transporters have been reported in association with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
