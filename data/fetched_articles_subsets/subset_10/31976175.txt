L-asparaginase is an important anticancer enzyme that is used in the first line 
treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This study was conducted to isolate 
L-asparaginase-producing endophytic fungi from medicinal plants of family 
Asteraceae. Seven healthy medicinal plants from family Asteraceae were selected 
for the isolation of endophytic fungi using standard surface sterilization 
techniques. A total of 837 isolates belonging to 84 species were comprised of 
the stem (55.6%), leaf (31.1%), root (10.6%) and flower (2.7%). Initial 
screening of L-asparaginase-producing endophytes was performed by qualitative 
plate assay on modified Czapex dox's agar medium. L-asparaginase activity of 
fungal endophytes was quantified by the nesslerization method. Identification of 
endophytic fungi was performed using both morphological characteristics and 
phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data including ribosomal DNA regions of 
ITS (Internal transcribed spacer) and LSU (partial large subunit rDNA), TEF1 
(Translation Elongation Factor) and TUB (β-tubulin). Of the 84 isolates, 38 were 
able to produce L-asparaginase and their L-asparaginase activities were between 
0.019 and 0.492 unit/mL with Fusarium proliferatum being the most potent. 
L-asparaginase-producing endophytes were identified as species of 
Plectosphaerella, Fusarium, Stemphylium, Septoria, Alternaria, Didymella, Phoma, 
Chaetosphaeronema, Sarocladium, Nemania, Epicoccum, Ulocladium and Cladosporium. 
This study showed that endophytic fungi from Asteraceae members have a high 
L-asparaginase-producing potential and they can be used as an alternative source 
for production of anticancer enzymes.
