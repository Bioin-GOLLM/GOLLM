Signaling cascades are managed in time and space by interactions between and 
among proteins. These interactions are often aided by adaptor proteins, which 
guide enzyme-substrate pairs into proximity. Miniature proteins are a class of 
small, well-folded protein domains possessing engineered binding properties. 
Here we made use of two miniature proteins with complementary binding properties 
to create a synthetic adaptor protein that effectively redirects a ubiquitous 
signaling event: tyrosine phosphorylation. We report that 
miniature-protein-based adaptor 3 uses templated catalysis to redirect the Src 
family kinase Hck to phosphorylate hDM2, a negative regulator of the p53 tumor 
suppressor and a poor Hck substrate. Phosphorylation occurs with multiple 
turnover and at a single site targeted by c-Abl kinase in the cell.
