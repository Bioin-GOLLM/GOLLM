The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has 
proven a challenge to healthcare systems since its first appearance in late 
2019. The global spread and devastating effects of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) on patients have resulted in countless studies on risk factors and 
disease progression. Overweight and obesity emerged as one of the major risk 
factors for developing severe COVID-19. Here we review the biology of 
coronavirus infections in relation to obesity. In particular, we review 
literature about the impact of adiposity-related systemic inflammation on the 
COVID-19 disease severity, involving cytokine, chemokine, leptin, and growth 
hormone signaling, and we discuss the involvement of hyperactivation of the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Due to the sheer number of 
publications on COVID-19, we cannot be completed, and therefore, we apologize 
for all the publications that we do not cite.
