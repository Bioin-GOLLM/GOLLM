l-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria (l-2-HGA) is characterized by progressive 
deterioration of central nervous system function including epilepsy and 
macrocephaly in 50% of cases, and elevated levels of l-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in 
urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging 
shows distinct abnormalities. We report the identification of a gene for l-2-HGA 
aciduria (MIM 236792) using homozygosity mapping. Nine homozygous mutations 
including three missense mutations, two nonsense mutations, two splice site 
mutations and two deletions were identified in the gene C14orf160, localized on 
chromosome 14q22.1, in 21 patients from one non-consanguineous and 14 
consanguineous Turkish families. We propose to name the gene duranin. Duranin 
encodes a putative mitochondrial protein with homology to FAD-dependent 
oxidoreductases. The functional role of this enzyme in intermediary metabolism 
in humans remains to be established.
