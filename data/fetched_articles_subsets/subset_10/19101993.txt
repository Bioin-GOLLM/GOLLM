We report an early detection of cancer in a child with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The 
proband was a 3-year-old male with a primitive mesenchymal tumor. Genetic 
analysis showed a germline TP53 mutation in codon 220 exon 6, which changed TAT 
--> TGT and resulted in a tyrosine-to-cysteine amino acid substitution 
(Tyr220Cys). The younger sister at risk was followed, and an asymptomatic 
adrenal cortical carcinoma was detected 3 years later. The report highlights the 
importance of genetic counseling and provides an example of early detection of 
cancers in childhood LFS carriers.
