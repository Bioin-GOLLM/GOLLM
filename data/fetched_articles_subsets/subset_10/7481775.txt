Severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (SCARMD) is a 
progressive muscle-wasting disorder common in North Africa that segregates with 
microsatellite markers at chromosome 13q12. Here, it is shown that a mutation in 
the gene encoding the 35-kilodalton dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, 
gamma-sarcoglycan, is likely to be the primary genetic defect in this disorder. 
The human gamma-sarcoglycan gene was mapped to chromosome 13q12, and deletions 
that alter its reading frame were identified in three families and one of four 
sporadic cases of SCARMD. These mutations not only affect gamma-sarcoglycan but 
also disrupt the integrity of the entire sarcoglycan complex.
