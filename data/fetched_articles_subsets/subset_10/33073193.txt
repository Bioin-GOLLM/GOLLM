Drug resistance is a constant threat to malaria control efforts making it 
important to maintain a good pipeline of new drug candidates. Of particular need 
are compounds that also block transmission by targeting sexual stage parasites. 
Mature sexual stages are relatively resistant to all currently used 
antimalarials except the 8-aminoquinolines that are not commonly used due to 
potential side effects. Here, we synthesized a new Torin 2 derivative, 
NCATS-SM3710 with increased aqueous solubility and specificity for Plasmodium 
and demonstrate potent in vivo activity against all P. berghei life cycle 
stages. NCATS-SM3710 also has low nanomolar EC50s against in vitro cultured 
asexual P. falciparum parasites (0.38 ± 0.04 nM) and late stage gametocytes 
(5.77 ± 1 nM). Two independent NCATS-SM3710/Torin 2 resistant P. falciparum 
parasite lines produced by growth in sublethal Torin 2 concentrations both had 
genetic changes in PF3D7_0509800, annotated as a phosphatidylinositol 4 kinase 
(Pf PI4KIIIβ). One line had a point mutation in the putative active site 
(V1357G), and the other line had a duplication of a locus containing 
Pf PI4KIIIβ. Both lines were also resistant to other Pf PI4K inhibitors. In 
addition NCATS-SM3710 inhibited purified Pf PI4KIIIβ with an IC50 of 2.0 ± 0.30 
nM. Together the results demonstrate that Pf PI4KIIIβ is the target of Torin 2 
and NCATS-SM3710 and provide new options for potent multistage drug development.
