Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles of nonhuman primates have 
been associated with disease susceptibility, resistance, and resolution. Here, 
using high-resolution pyrosequencing, we characterized MHC class I transcripts 
expressed in Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), a nonhuman primate population 
with restricted MHC diversity. Using this approach, we identified 67 distinct 
MHC class I transcripts encoded by the seven most frequent MCM MHC class I 
haplotypes, 40 (60%) of which span the complete open reading frames. These 
results double the number of MHC class I sequences previously defined by cloning 
and Sanger sequencing of cDNA-PCR products and provide a rapid, high-throughput, 
and economical method for MHC characterization. Overall, this approach 
significantly expanded our knowledge of MCM haplotypes and will facilitate 
future studies on disease pathogenesis and protective cellular immunity.
