OBJECTIVE: The current study investigated the mechanism underlying the 
therapeutic effects of berberine in the vasculature in hypertension.
METHODS: Angiotensin II (Ang II)-loaded osmotic pumps were implanted in C57BL/6J 
mice with or without berberine administration. Mouse aortae were suspended in 
myograph for force measurement. Microarray technology were performed to analyze 
expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the aortae. These dysregulated 
expressions were then validated by qRT-PCR. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network 
was constructed to reveal the specific relationships.
RESULTS: Ang Ⅱ resulted in a significant increase in the blood pressure of mice, 
which was suppressed by berberine. The impaired endothelium-dependent aortic 
relaxation was restored in hypertensive mice. Microarray data revealed that 578 
lncRNAs and 554 mRNAs were up-regulated, while 320 lncRNAs and 377 mRNAs were 
down-regulated in the aortae by Ang Ⅱ; both were reversed by berberine 
treatment. qRT-PCR validation results of differentially expressed genes (14 
lncRNAs and 6 mRNAs) were completely consistent with the microarray data. GO 
analysis showed that these verified differentially expressed genes were 
significantly enriched in terms of "cellular process", "biological regulation" 
and "regulation of biological process", whilst KEGG analysis identified vascular 
function-related pathways including cAMP signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling 
pathway, and calcium signaling pathway etc. Importantly, we observed that lncRNA 
ENSMUST00000144849, ENSMUST00000155383, and AK041185 were majorly expressed in 
endothelial cells.
CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that the five lncRNAs 
ENSMUST00000144849, NR_028422, ENSMUST00000155383, AK041185, and uc.335+ might 
serve critical regulatory roles in hypertensive vasculature by targeting pivotal 
mRNAs and subsequently affecting vascular function-related pathways. Moreover, 
these lncRNAs were modulated by berberine, therefore providing the novel 
potential therapeutic targets of berberine in hypertension. Furthermore, lncRNA 
ENSMUST00000144849, ENSMUST00000155383, and AK041185 might be involved in the 
preservation of vascular endothelial cell function.
