The CacyBP/SIP protein is sumoylated in neuroblastoma NB2a cells.

Wasik U, Filipek A.

The Calcyclin binding protein and Siah-1 interacting protein (CacyBP/SIP) 
protein is highly expressed in mammalian brain as well as in neuroblastoma NB2a 
cells and pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. This protein interacts with several 
targets such as cytoskeletal proteins or ERK1/2 kinase and seems to be involved 
in many cellular processes. In this work we examined a post-translational 
modification of CacyBP/SIP which might have an effect on its function. Since 
theoretical analysis of the amino acid sequence of CacyBP/SIP indicated several 
lysine residues which could potentially be sumoylated we checked experimentally 
whether this protein might be modified by SUMO attachment. We have shown that 
indeed CacyBP/SIP bound the E2 SUMO ligase, Ubc9, in neuroblastoma NB2a cell 
extract and was sumoylated in these cells. By fractionation of NB2a cell extract 
we have found that, contrary to the majority of SUMO-modified proteins, 
sumoylated CacyBP/SIP is present in the cytoplasmic and not in the nuclear 
fraction. We have also established that lysine 16 is the residue which undergoes 
sumoylation in the CacyBP/SIP protein.
