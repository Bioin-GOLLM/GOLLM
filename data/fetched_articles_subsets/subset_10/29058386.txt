Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an inherited aminoaciduria with an 
autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.The first two cases of sisters being 
diagnosed with LPI in China is contained within this report. In our cases, there 
were two heterozygous mutations in the SLC7A7 gene of the two sisters: deletion 
of c.1387: del C and IVS4+1C>T. One patient was treated with inhaled rGM-CSF for 
1.5 years at 5 μg/kg two times a day. Her condition is improving with no side 
effects.
