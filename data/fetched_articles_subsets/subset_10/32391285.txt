Yersinia pestis, Brucella spp., and Bacillus anthracis are pathogens that can 
cause infectious zoonotic diseases with high mortality rates. An upconverting 
phosphor-based quantitative immunochromatographic (UPT-LF) assay, a 
point-of-care testing method suitable for resource-limited areas, was calibrated 
to quantitatively detect pathogenic bacteria. The bacterial purity or activity 
were ensured via staining methods and growth curves, respectively. Growth assays 
showed that the classic plate-counting method underestimated bacterial numbers 
compared with the bacterial counting method recommended by the reference 
material of the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, China. The 
detection results of the UPT-LF assay differed significantly between the 
bacterial cultures in liquid and solid media and between different strains. 
Accelerated stability assessments and freeze-thaw experiments showed that the 
stability of the corresponding antigens played an important role in calibrating 
the UPT-LF assay. In this study, a new calibration system was developed for 
quantitative immunochromatography for detecting pathogenic bacteria. The results 
demonstrated the necessity of calibration for standardizing point-of-care 
testing methods.
