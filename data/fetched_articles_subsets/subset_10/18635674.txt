It has been recently shown that Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met 
polymorphism strongly influences prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic 
startle response (ASR) in healthy human volunteers. Given that schizophrenia 
patients exhibit impairment in PPI and that COMT is a putative susceptibility 
gene for schizophrenia, we investigated the impact of the COMT Val(158)Met 
polymorphisms on PPI in schizophrenic inpatients. We analyzed COMT Val(158)Met 
polymorphisms and assessed startle reactivity, habituation, and PPI of ASR in 68 
Caucasian schizophrenia inpatients. Clinical symptoms were measured with the 
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Patients carrying the Val(158)Met 
Met/Met allele showed elevated PPI levels whereas startle reactivity and 
habituation did not differ from the other two genotypes. These preliminary 
results imply that PPI is influenced by COMT Val(158)Met genotype in 
schizophrenia as well. In concert with other findings, our data suggest that PPI 
is a polygenic trait.
