Background: Optic atrophy-13 with retinal and foveal abnormalities (OPA13) (MIM 
#165510) is a mitochondrial disease in which apparent bilateral optic atrophy is 
present and sometimes followed by retinal pigmentary changes or photoreceptors 
degeneration. OPA13 is caused by heterozygous mutation in the SSBP1 gene, 
associated with variable mitochondrial dysfunctions. Results: We have previously 
reported a 16-year-old Taiwanese male diagnosed with OPA13 and SSBP1 variant 
c.320G>A (p.Arg107Gln) was identified by whole exon sequence (WES). This variant 
was assumed to be de novo since his parents were clinically unaffected. However, 
WES and Sanger sequencing further revealed the probandâ€™s unaffected mother 
carrying the same SSBP1 variant with a 13% variant allele frequency (VAF) in her 
peripheral blood. That finding strongly indicates the maternal gonosomal 
mosaicism contributing to OPA13, which has not been reported before. 
Conclusions: In summary, we described the first case of OPA13 caused by maternal 
gonosomal mosaicism in SSBP1 . Parental mosaicism could be a serious issue in 
OPA13 diagnosis, and appropriate genetic counseling should be considered.
