SATB2-associated syndrome (SAS) is a rare condition, and it is characterized by 
severe developmental delay/intellectual disability, especially severe speech 
delay/or absence, craniofacial abnormalities, and behavioral problems. Most of 
the published reports are limited to children, with little information about the 
natural history of the disease and the possible novel signs and symptoms or 
behavioral changes in adulthood. We describe the management and follow-up of a 
25-year-old male with SAS due to a de novo heterozygous nonsense variant 
SATB2:c.715C>T:p.(Arg239*) identified by whole-exome sequencing and review the 
literature. The case herein described contributes to a better characterization 
of the natural history of this genetic condition and in addition to the 
genotype-phenotype correlation of the SATB2:c.715C>T:p.(Arg239*) variant in SAS, 
highlights some particularities of its management.
