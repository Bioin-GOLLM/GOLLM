BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by impairments in synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance. 
Cognitive dysfunction and loss of neuronal plasticity are known to begin decades 
before the clinical diagnosis of the disease. The important influence of 
congenital genetic mutations on the early development of AD provides a novel 
opportunity to initiate treatment during early development to prevent the 
Alzheimer-like behavior and synaptic dysfunction.
OBJECTIVE: To explore strategies for early intervention to prevent Alzheimer's 
disease.
METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the effect of treatment during 
early development with a ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) derived peptidergic 
compound, P021 (Ac-DGGLAG-NH2) on cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in 
3xTg-AD transgenic mouse model of AD. 3xTg-AD and genetic background-matched 
wild type female mice were treated from birth to postnatal day 120 with P021 in 
diet or as a control with vehicle diet, and cognitive function and molecular 
markers of neuroplasticity were evaluated.
RESULTS: P021 treatment during early development prevented cognitive impairment 
and increased expressions of pCREB and BDNF that activated downstream various 
signaling cascades such as PLC/PKC, MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt, and ameliorated 
synaptic protein deficit in 4-month-old 3xTg-AD mice.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that treatment with the neurotrophic peptide 
mimetic such as P021 during early development can be an effective therapeutic 
strategy to rescue synaptic deficit and cognitive impairment in familial AD and 
related tauopathies.
