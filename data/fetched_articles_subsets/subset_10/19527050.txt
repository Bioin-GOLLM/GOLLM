S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) is a key enzyme in the polyamine 
biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition of this pathway and subsequent depletion of 
polyamine levels is a viable strategy for cancer chemotherapy and for the 
treatment of parasitic diseases. Substrate analogue inhibitors display an 
absolute requirement for a positive charge at the position equivalent to the 
sulfonium of S-adenosylmethionine. We investigated the ligand specificity of 
AdoMetDC through crystallography, quantum chemical calculations, and 
stopped-flow experiments. We determined crystal structures of the enzyme 
cocrystallized with 5'-deoxy-5'-dimethylthioadenosine and 
5'-deoxy-5'-(N-dimethyl)amino-8-methyladenosine. The crystal structures revealed 
a favorable cation-pi interaction between the ligand and the aromatic side 
chains of Phe7 and Phe223. The estimated stabilization from this interaction is 
4.5 kcal/mol as determined by quantum chemical calculations. Stopped-flow 
kinetic experiments showed that the rate of the substrate binding to the enzyme 
greatly depends on Phe7 and Phe223, thus supporting the importance of the 
cation-pi interaction.
