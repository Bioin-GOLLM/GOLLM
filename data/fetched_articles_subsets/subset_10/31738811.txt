BACKGROUND: To curb increasing resistance rates, responsible antimicrobial use 
(AMU) is needed, both in human and veterinary medicine. In human healthcare, 
antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs) have been implemented worldwide to 
improve appropriate AMU. No ASPs have been developed for and implemented in 
companion animal clinics yet.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to implement and evaluate the 
effectiveness of an ASP in 44 Dutch companion animal clinics. The objectives of 
the ASP were to increase awareness on AMU, to decrease total AMU whenever 
possible and to shift AMU towards 1st choice antimicrobials, according to Dutch 
guidelines on veterinary AMU.
METHODS: The study was designed as a prospective, stepped-wedge, intervention 
study, which was performed from March 2016 until March 2018. The multifaceted 
intervention was developed using previous qualitative and quantitative research 
on current prescribing behaviour in Dutch companion animal clinics. The number 
of Defined Daily Doses for Animal (DDDAs) per clinic (total, 1st, 2nd and 3rd 
choice AMU) was used to quantify systemic AMU. Monthly AMU data were described 
using a mixed effect time series model with auto-regression. The effect of the 
ASP was modelled using a step function and a change in the (linear) time trend.
RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease of 15% (7%-22%) in total AMU, 15% 
(5%-24%) in 1st choice AMU and 26% (17%-34%) in 2nd choice AMU was attributed to 
participation in the ASP, on top of the already ongoing time trends. Use of 3rd 
choice AMs did not significantly decrease by participation in the ASP. The 
change in total AMU became more prominent over time, with a 16% (4%-26%) 
decrease in (linear) time trend per year.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that, although AMU in Dutch companion animal 
clinics was already decreasing and changing, AMU could be further optimised by 
participation in an antimicrobial stewardship programme.
