The kinase Akt plays a central role as a regulator of multiple growth factor 
input signals, thus making it an attractive anticancer drug target. A-443654 is 
an ATP-competitive Akt inhibitor. Unexpectedly, treatment of cells with A-443654 
causes paradoxical hyperphosphorylation of Akt at its two regulatory sites 
(Thr308 and Ser473). We explored whether inhibitor-induced hyperphosphorylation 
of Akt by A-443654 is a consequence of disrupted feedback regulation at a 
pathway level or whether it is a direct consequence of inhibitor binding to the 
ATP binding site of Akt. Catalytically inactive mutants of Akt revealed that 
binding of an inhibitor to the ATP site of Akt is sufficient to directly cause 
hyperphosphorylation of the kinase in the absence of any pathway feedback 
effects. We conclude that ATP-competitive Akt inhibitors impart regulatory 
phosphorylation of their target kinase Akt. These results provide new insights 
into both natural regulation of Akt activation and Akt inhibitors entering the 
clinic.
