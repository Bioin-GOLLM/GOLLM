BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a universally lethal tumor with frequently 
overexpressed or mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). NADPH quinone 
oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione-S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1) are commonly 
upregulated in GBM. NQO1 and GSTP1 decrease the formation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), which mediates the oxidative stress and promotes GBM cell 
proliferation.
METHODS: High-throughput screen was used for agents selectively active against 
GBM cells with EGFRvIII mutations. Co-crystal structures were revealed molecular 
details of target recognition. Pharmacological and gene knockdown/overexpression 
approaches were used to investigate the oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: We identified a small molecular inhibitor, "MNPC," that binds to both 
NQO1 and GSTP1 with high affinity and selectivity. MNPC inhibits NQO1 and GSTP1 
enzymes and induces apoptosis in GBM, specifically inhibiting the growth of cell 
lines and primary GBM bearing the EGFRvIII mutation. Co-crystal structures 
between MNPC and NQO1, and molecular docking of MNPC with GSTP1 reveal that it 
binds the active sites and acts as a potent dual inhibitor. Inactivation of both 
NQO1 and GSTP1 with siRNA or MNPC results in imbalanced redox homeostasis, 
leading to apoptosis and mitigated cancer proliferation in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, MNPC, a dual inhibitor for both NQO1 and GSTP1, provides a 
novel lead compound for treating GBM via the exploitation of specific 
vulnerabilities created by mutant EGFR.
