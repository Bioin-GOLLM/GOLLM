Adult muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) II deficiency is a rare 
autosomal recessive disorder of long-chain fatty acid metabolism. It is 
typically associated with recurrent episodes of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis 
and myoglobinuria, in most cases caused by a c.338C > T mutation in the CPT2 
gene. Here we present the pedigree of one of the largest family studies of CPT 
II deficiency caused by the c.338C > T mutation, documented so far. The pedigree 
comprises 24 blood relatives of the index patient, a 32 year old female with 
genetically proven CPT II deficiency. In total, the mutation was detected in 20 
family members, among them five homozygotes and 15 heterozygotes. Among all 
homozygotes, first symptoms of CPT II deficiency occurred during childhood. 
Additionally, two already deceased relatives of the index patient were carriers 
of at least one copy of the genetic variant, revealing a remarkably high 
prevalence of the c.338C > T mutation within the tested family. Beside the index 
patient, only one individual had been diagnosed with CPT II deficiency prior to 
this study and three cases of CPT II deficiency were newly detected by this 
family study, pointing to a general underdiagnosis of the disease. Therefore, 
this study emphasizes the need to raise awareness of CPT II deficiency for 
correct diagnosis and accurate management of the disease.
