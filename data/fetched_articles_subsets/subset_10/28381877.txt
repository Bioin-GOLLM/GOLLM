Intra-tumor heterogeneity is a big barrier to precision medicine. To explore the 
underlying clonal diversity in lung adenocarcinomas, we selected nine 
individuals with whole-genome sequencing data from primary and matched 
metastatic tumors as a cohort for study. Similar global pattern of arm-level 
copy number changes and large variations of somatic single-nucleotide variant 
between the primary and metastasis are observed in the majority of cases. 
Importantly, we found breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles acting as an important 
mechanism for underlying cancer gene amplification, such as amplification of 
CDK4, CDKN3 and FGFR1 in early stage. We also identified recurrent focal 
amplification of gene CCNY derived from BFB in two metastatic tumors, but not in 
primary tumor. Clonal analysis of case 236T demonstrated that mutational 
processes are varying with tumor progression. Collectively, our data provide new 
insights into genetic diversity and potential therapeutic target in lung 
adenocarcinoma.
