Conformational preferences of amino acid residues in water are determined by the 
backbone and side-chain properties. Alanine is known for its high polyproline II 
(pPII) propensity. The question of relative contributions of the backbone and 
side chain to the conformational preferences of alanine and other amino acid 
residues in water is not fully resolved. Because glycine lacks a heavy-atom side 
chain, glycine-based peptides can be used to examine to which extent the 
backbone properties affect the conformational space. Here, we use published 
spectroscopic data for the central glycine residue of cationic triglycine in 
water to demonstrate that its conformational space is dominated by the pPII 
state. We assess three commonly used molecular dynamics (MD) force fields with 
respect to their ability to capture the conformational preferences of the 
central glycine residue in triglycine. We show that pPII is the mesostate that 
enables the functional backbone groups of the central residue to form the most 
hydrogen bonds with water. Our results indicate that the pPII propensity of the 
central glycine in GGG is comparable to that of alanine in GAG, implying that 
the water-backbone hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high pPII content of 
these residues.
