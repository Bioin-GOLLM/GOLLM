Background: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a 
rare disease presenting with syncopal events and sudden cardiac death at a young 
age in the absence of structural heart disease. Two major genes have been shown 
to be responsible for CPVT: RYR2 and CASQ2 genes involved in calcium 
homeostasis.Methods: We report here clinical and molecular investigation of a 
consanguineous Tunisian family including three affected members. Involvement of 
RYR2 and CASQ2 genes was investigated.Results: Mutation screening for RYR2 gene 
showed that no mutation were detected in the coding sequence. A novel variation 
c.572C/T was identified in CASQ2 gene leading to a p.Pro191Leu.Conclusion: To 
our knowledge, this is the first clinical and genetic investigation of CPVT in 
North Africa.
