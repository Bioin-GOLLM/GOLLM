The UCH37 deubiquitylase functions in two large and very different complexes, 
the 26S proteasome and the INO80 chromatin remodeler. We have performed 
biochemical characterization and determined crystal structures of UCH37 in 
complexes with RPN13 and NFRKB, which mediate its recruitment to the proteasome 
and INO80, respectively. RPN13 and NFRKB make similar contacts to the UCH37 
C-terminal domain but quite different contacts to the catalytic UCH domain. 
RPN13 can activate UCH37 by disrupting dimerization, although physiologically 
relevant activation likely results from stabilization of a surface competent for 
ubiquitin binding and modulation of the active-site crossover loop. In contrast, 
NFRKB inhibits UCH37 by blocking the ubiquitin-binding site and by disrupting 
the enzyme active site. These findings reveal remarkable commonality in 
mechanisms of recruitment, yet very different mechanisms of regulating enzyme 
activity, and provide a foundation for understanding the roles of UCH37 in the 
unrelated proteasome and INO80 complexes.
