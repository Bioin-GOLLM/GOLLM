Metabolic reprogramming in skeletal muscles in the human and animal models of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may be an important factor in the diseases 
progression. We hypothesized that swim training, a modulator of cellular 
metabolism via changes in muscle bioenergetics and oxidative stress, ameliorates 
the reduction in muscle strength in ALS mice. In this study, we used transgenic 
male mice with the G93A human SOD1 mutation B6SJL-Tg (SOD1G93A) 1Gur/J and wild 
type B6SJL (WT) mice. Mice were subjected to a grip strength test and isolated 
skeletal muscle mitochondria were used to perform high-resolution respirometry. 
Moreover, the activities of enzymes involved in the oxidative energy metabolism 
and total sulfhydryl groups (as an oxidative stress marker) were evaluated in 
skeletal muscle. ALS reduces muscle strength (-70% between 11 and 15 weeks, p < 
0.05), modulates muscle metabolism through lowering citrate synthase (CS) (-30% 
vs. WT, p = 0.0007) and increasing cytochrome c oxidase and malate dehydrogenase 
activities, and elevates oxidative stress markers in skeletal muscle. Swim 
training slows the reduction in muscle strength (-5% between 11 and 15 weeks) 
and increases CS activity (+26% vs. ALS I, p = 0.0048). Our findings indicate 
that swim training is a modulator of skeletal muscle energy metabolism with 
concomitant improvement of skeletal muscle function in ALS mice.
