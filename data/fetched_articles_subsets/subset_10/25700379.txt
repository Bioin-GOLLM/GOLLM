Club cell secretory protein-16 (CC16) is the major secreted product of airway 
club cells, but its role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) is unclear. We measured CC16 airway expression in humans with and 
without COPD and CC16 function in a cigarette smoke (CS)-induced COPD murine 
model. Airway CC16 expression was measured in COPD patients, smokers without 
COPD and non-smokers. We exposed wildtype (WT) and CC16(-/-)mice to CS or air 
for up to 6 months, and measured airway CC16 expression, pulmonary inflammation, 
alveolar septal cell apoptosis, airspace enlargement, airway mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) 
expression, small airway remodelling and pulmonary function. Smokers and COPD 
patients had reduced airway CC16 immunostaining that decreased with increasing 
COPD severity. Exposing mice to CS reduced airway CC16 expression. CC16(-/-) 
mice had greater CS-induced emphysema, airway remodelling, pulmonary 
inflammation, alveolar cell apoptosis, airway MUC5AC expression, and more 
compliant lungs than WT mice. These changes were associated with increased 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in CC16(-/-) lungs. CS-induced acute 
pulmonary changes were reversed by adenoviral-mediated over-expression of CC16. 
CC16 protects lungs from CS-induced injury by reducing lung NF-κB activation. 
CS-induced airway CC16 deficiency increases CS-induced pulmonary inflammation 
and injury and likely contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD.
