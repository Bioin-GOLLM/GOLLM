Natural rubber (NR) is stored in latex as rubber particles (RPs), rubber 
molecules surrounded by a lipid monolayer. Rubber transferase (RTase), the 
enzyme responsible for NR biosynthesis, is believed to be a member of the 
cis-prenyltransferase (cPT) family. However, none of the recombinant cPTs have 
shown RTase activity independently. We show that HRT1, a cPT from 
Heveabrasiliensis, exhibits distinct RTase activity in vitro only when it is 
introduced on detergent-washed HeveaRPs (WRPs) by a cell-free 
translation-coupled system. Using this system, a heterologous cPT from 
Lactucasativa also exhibited RTase activity, indicating proper introduction of 
cPT on RP is the key to reconstitute active RTase. RP proteomics and interaction 
network analyses revealed the formation of the protein complex consisting of 
HRT1, rubber elongation factor (REF) and HRT1-REF BRIDGING PROTEIN. The RTase 
activity enhancement observed for the complex assembled on WRPs indicates the 
HRT1-containing complex functions as the NR biosynthetic machinery.
