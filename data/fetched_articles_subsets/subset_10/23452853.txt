Endosomal protein trafficking is an essential cellular process that is 
deregulated in several diseases and targeted by pathogens. Here, we describe a 
role for ubiquitination in this process. We find that the E3 RING ubiquitin 
ligase, MAGE-L2-TRIM27, localizes to endosomes through interactions with the 
retromer complex. Knockdown of MAGE-L2-TRIM27 or the Ube2O E2 
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme significantly impaired retromer-mediated transport. 
We further demonstrate that MAGE-L2-TRIM27 ubiquitin ligase activity is required 
for nucleation of endosomal F-actin by the WASH regulatory complex, a known 
regulator of retromer-mediated transport. Mechanistic studies showed that 
MAGE-L2-TRIM27 facilitates K63-linked ubiquitination of WASH K220. 
Significantly, disruption of WASH ubiquitination impaired endosomal F-actin 
nucleation and retromer-dependent transport. These findings provide a cellular 
and molecular function for MAGE-L2-TRIM27 in retrograde transport, including an 
unappreciated role of K63-linked ubiquitination and identification of an 
activating signal of the WASH regulatory complex.
