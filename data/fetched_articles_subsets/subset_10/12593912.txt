For some years synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of 
Galpha proteins represented an useful tool to study the molecular mechanism of 
the interaction between these proteins and the G protein coupled receptors. 
Recently, we have focused our attention on the study of the A(2A) receptor-G(s) 
protein system. We have synthesised a series of 11-mer peptides from the 
Galpha(s) C-terminus in which residue at position-2 (Leu(393)) has been 
alternatively substituted with amino acids having different physico-chemical 
properties. The aim of our work was to probe the role played by Leu(393) in the 
receptor/Galpha(s) interaction. All synthetic peptides were tested for their 
ability to affect the adenylyl cyclase activity stimulated by agonist activation 
of A(2A) adenosine receptors. Our data point out a relevant role played by the 
side chain of this residue for a correct G protein/receptor coupling, even 
though the presence of other residues at position-2 of Galpha(s) C-terminus is 
tolerated. Furthermore, molecular dynamics calculations on the peptides having 
greater activity show a correlation between the spatial arrangement of the side 
chain of residue at position-2 and biological activity of synthetic peptides.
