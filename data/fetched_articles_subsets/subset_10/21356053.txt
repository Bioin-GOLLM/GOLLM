Mechanisms concerning life or death decisions in protozoan parasites are still 
imperfectly understood. Comparison with higher eukaryotes has led to the 
hypothesis that caspase-like enzymes could be involved in death pathways. This 
hypothesis was reinforced by the description of caspase-related sequences in the 
genome of several parasites, including Plasmodium, Trypanosoma and Leishmania. 
Although several teams are working to decipher the exact role of metacaspases in 
protozoan parasites, partial, conflicting or negative results have been obtained 
with respect to the relationship between protozoan metacaspases and cell death. 
The aim of this paper is to review current knowledge of protozoan parasite 
metacaspases within a drug targeting perspective.
