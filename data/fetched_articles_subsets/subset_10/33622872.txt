BACKGROUND/AIM: Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) is overexpressed in asthma, and 
negatively associated with forced expiratory volume in the first second. This 
study aimed at evaluating whether CHI3L1 genotypes affect asthma risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The blood samples of 198 asthma patients and 453 control 
subjects were collected, and the genotypic patterns of CHI3L1 -131C/G 
(rs4950928) and -247G/A (rs1262491437) were examined.
RESULTS: The percentages of CG and GG at CHI3L1 -131C/G were 32.8% and 7.6% 
among the asthma cases, respectively, significantly higher than the 23.8% and 
3.1% among the non-asthmatic healthy subjects (p for trend=0.0009). The allelic 
frequency distribution analysis showed that the G allele at CHI3L1 - 131C/G 
conferred a significantly higher asthma risk than the wild-type C allele 
(p<0.0001). The genotypic and allelic frequency analyses for CHI3L1 -247G/A did 
not show any significant difference.
CONCLUSION: The G allele at CHI3L1-131C/G serves as a biomarker in determining 
personal susceptibility to asthma in Taiwan.
