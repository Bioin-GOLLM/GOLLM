BACKGROUND: Humoral mediators of inflammation, in particular the complement 
system, have been described to play an important role in atherogenesis. 
Previously, we found a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the complement 5 
gene (C5 rs17611, A>G) independently associated with stroke. Up to now, the 
impact of C5 rs17611 on the progression of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular 
outcome in patients with asymptomatic atherosclerosis was unclear.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated C5 rs17611 in a cohort of 1065 
consecutive patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis. All patients 
were prospectively followed for the progression of carotid atherosclerosis and 
the development of a first major cardiovascular event (MACE), respectively.
RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-seven patients (31·6%) experienced a MACE 
during a median follow-up of 3·0 years. The homozygous GG genotype of the C5 
rs17611 was significantly associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome 
(adjusted HR: 1·36 [95% CI, 1·07-1·73]; P = 0·01). After stratification for sex, 
C5 rs17611 CC was found to be an independent risk factor for MACE in men (HR 
1·50 [95% CI, 1·12-1·83]). No association of C5 rs17611 with progression of 
carotid stenosis, observed in 93 (8·7%) patients, was detectable. Performance of 
ELISA indicated a significant association of the C5 rs17611 variant with C5a 
plasma levels.
CONCLUSION: The C5 rs17611 GG genotype is associated with increased C5a plasma 
levels and represents a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcome in male 
patients with carotid atherosclerosis.
