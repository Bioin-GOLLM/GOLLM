Autophagy is required for the homeostasis of cellular material and is proposed 
to be involved in many aspects of health. Defects in the autophagy pathway have 
been observed in neurodegenerative disorders; however, no genetically-inherited 
pathogenic mutations in any of the core autophagy-related (ATG) genes have been 
reported in human patients to date. We identified a homozygous missense 
mutation, changing a conserved amino acid, in ATG5 in two siblings with 
congenital ataxia, mental retardation, and developmental delay. The subjects' 
cells display a decrease in autophagy flux and defects in conjugation of ATG12 
to ATG5. The homologous mutation in yeast demonstrates a 30-50% reduction of 
induced autophagy. Flies in which Atg5 is substituted with the mutant human ATG5 
exhibit severe movement disorder, in contrast to flies expressing the wild-type 
human protein. Our results demonstrate the critical role of autophagy in 
preventing neurological diseases and maintaining neuronal health.
