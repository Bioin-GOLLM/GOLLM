There are no effective therapeutic targets or strategies that simultaneously 
inhibit tumour growth and promote cardiac function recovery. Here, we analyzed 
targets for cancer treatments and cardiac repair, with demethylation emerging as 
a common factor in these candidate lists. As DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) 
majorly responds to methylation, a natural compound library is screened, 
identifying dioscin as a novel agent targeted at DNMT1, widely used for heart 
diseases. Dioscin was found to reduce DNMT activities and inhibits growth in 
breast cancer cells. Combined with analyses of RNA-seq and MeDIP-seq, the 
promoters of antioxidant genes were demethylated after dioscin, recruiting NRF2 
and elevating their expression. In Nrf2 knockout mice, the cardiac protection 
role of dioscin was blocked by Nrf2-loss. Furthermore, in tumour-bearing mice 
with hypertrophy, dioscin was observed to inhibit tumour growth and alleviate 
cardiac injury simultaneously. This study is the first to identify dioscin as a 
novel demethylation agent with dual functions of anti-cancer and 
cardio-protection.
