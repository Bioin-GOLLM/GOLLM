OBJECTIVE: Crizotinib can target against mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) 
and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which has been considered as a 
multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The objective of this study was 
to explore the efficacy of crizotinib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) with concomitant ALK rearrangement and c-Met overexpression.
METHODS: Totally, 4622 advanced NSCLC patients from two institutes (3762 
patients at the Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute from January 2011 to December 
2016 and 860 cases at the Perking Cancer Hospital from January 2015 to December 
2016) were screened for ALK rearrangement with any method of IHC, RACE-coupled 
PCR or FISH. C-Met expression was performed by IHC in ALK-rearranged patients, 
and more than 50% of cells with high staining were defined as c-Met 
overexpression. The efficacy of crizotinib was explored in the ALK-rearranged 
patients with or without c-Met overexpression.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients were identified with c-Met overexpression in 160 
ALK-rearranged cases, with the incidence of 10.0% (16/160). A total of 116 
ALK-rearranged patients received the treatment of crizotinib. Objective response 
rate (ORR) was 86.7% (13/15) in ALK-rearranged patients with c-Met 
overexpression and 59.4% (60/101)in those without c-Met overexpression, 
P = 0.041. Median PFS showed a trend of superiority in c-Met overexpression 
group (15.2 versus 11.0 months, P = 0.263). Median overall survival (OS) showed 
a significant difference for ALK-rearranged patients with c-Met overexpression 
group of 33.5 months with the hazard ratio (HR) of 3.2.
CONCLUSIONS: C-Met overexpression co-exists with ALK rearrangement in a small 
population of advanced NSCLC. There may be a trend of favorable efficacy of 
crizotinib in such co-altered patients.
