BACKGROUND: There is no objective test that can unequivocally confirm the 
diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (AD), and no uniform clinical definition.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate to what extent operational definitions of AD cause 
fluctuation in the prevalence estimates and the associated risk factors.
METHODS: We first reviewed the operational definitions of AD used in the 
literature. We then tested the impact of the choice of the most common 
definitions of 'cases' and 'controls' on AD prevalence estimates and associated 
risk factors (including filaggrin mutations) among children aged 5 years in two 
population-based birth cohorts: the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS) 
and Asthma in Ashford. Model performance was measured by the percentage of 
children within an area of clinical indecision (defined as having a posterior 
probability of AD between 25% and 60%).
RESULTS: We identified 59 different definitions of AD across 45 reviewed 
studies. Of those, we chose four common 'case' definitions and two definitions 
of 'controls'. The prevalence estimates using different case definitions ranged 
between 22% and 33% in MAAS, and between 12% and 22% in Ashford. The area of 
clinical indecision ranged from 32% to 44% in MAAS and from 9% to 29% in 
Ashford. Depending on the case definition used, the associations with filaggrin 
mutations varied, with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) ranging from 1·8 
(1·1-2·9) to 2·2 (1·3-3·7) in MAAS and 1·7 (0·8-3·7) to 2·3 (1·2-4·5) in 
Ashford. Associations with filaggrin mutations also differed when using the same 
'case' definition but different definitions of 'controls'.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of different definitions of AD results in substantial 
differences in prevalence estimates, the performance of prediction models and 
association with risk factors. What's already known about this topic? There is 
no objective test that can unequivocally confirm the diagnosis of atopic 
dermatitis (AD) and no uniform clinical definition. This results in different 
definitions utilized in AD studies, raising concerns on the generalizability of 
the results and comparability across different studies. What does this study 
add? This study has shown that different definitions of 'cases' and 'controls' 
have major impacts upon prevalence estimates and associations with risk factors, 
including genetics, in two population-based birth cohorts. These findings 
suggest the importance of developing a consensus on AD definitions of both 
'controls' and 'cases' to minimize biases in studies.
