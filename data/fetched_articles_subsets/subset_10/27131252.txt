INTRODUCTION: Mandibular retrognathism may be the result of a developmental 
abnormality or the unfavorable positional relationship of developing jaws. 
Several lines of evidence suggest that muscles are known to have extensive 
mutual effects on bones. Studies with immunohistochemical staining and gene 
expression have shown unique combinations of myosin heavy chain isoforms in the 
masseter muscles. In this study, we aimed to evaluate MYO1H gene polymorphisms 
and haplotypes as risk factors for mandibular retrognathism.
METHODS: Twenty-five subjects with mandibular retrognathism and 25 control 
subjects of both sexes having an orthognathic maxilla (SNA, 82° ± 2°) between 
the ages of 12 and 30 years of age were selected for this study. Based on the 
cephalometric values, subjects with SNB angles smaller than 78° were considered 
to have mandibular retrognathism. Orthognathic subjects (SNB, 80°) without jaw 
deformations were used as the comparison group. Three polymorphisms of MYO1H 
gene (rs10850110, rs11611277, and rs3825393) were genotyped using polymerase 
chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Associations were 
tested with the Pearson chi-square test and haplotype analyses.
RESULTS: The single nucleotide polymorphism rs3825393 showed a statistically 
significant association with mandibular retrognathism. The cephalometric 
variables SNB and ANB angles showed significant differences among the various 
genotypes of rs3825393. Linkage disequilibrium was not strong and significant 
between the single nucleotide polymorphisms; hence, the haplotypes of the MYO1H 
gene are not associated with mandibular retrognathism.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the rs3825393 polymorphism of the MYO1H 
gene is associated with an increased risk for mandibular retrognathism. The 
relatively small sample size used in the study resulted in modest statistical 
power. A parallel investigation on another population with larger samples to 
increase the power could further clarify the role of the MYO1H gene in causing 
mandibular retrognathism.
