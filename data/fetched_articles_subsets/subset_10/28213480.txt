BACKGROUND: Drug-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for 
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many 
marketed and withdrawn medications. The contribution of common genetic variants 
previously associated with baseline QT interval to drug-induced QT prolongation 
and arrhythmias is not known.
METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of common genetic 
variants contributing to QT interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide 
association studies, can predict individual response to multiple QT-prolonging 
drugs. Genetic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of 
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 
QT-prolonging drugs with 15 time-matched QT and plasma drug concentration 
measurements. Subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, 
ranolazine, and placebo. The outcome was the correlation between a genetic QT 
score comprising 61 common genetic variants and the slope of an individual 
subject's drug-induced increase in heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) versus drug 
concentration.
RESULTS: The genetic QT score was correlated with drug-induced QTc prolongation. 
Among white subjects, genetic QT score explained 30% of the variability in 
response to dofetilide (r=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.81; P=0.02), 23% 
in response to quinidine (r=0.48; 95% confidence interval, -0.03 to 0.79; 
P=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (r=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 
0.05-0.80; P=0.03). Furthermore, the genetic QT score was a significant 
predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes in an independent sample of 216 
cases compared with 771 controls (r2=12%, P=1×10-7).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic 
variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in drug-induced QT 
prolongation and is a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes. 
These findings highlight an opportunity for recent genetic discoveries to 
improve individualized risk-benefit assessment for pharmacological therapies. 
Replication of these findings in larger samples is needed to more precisely 
estimate variance explained and to establish the individual variants that drive 
these effects.
