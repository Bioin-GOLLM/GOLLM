BACKGROUND: Many genetic variants have been identified in the human genome. The 
functional effects of a single variant have been intensively studied. However, 
the joint effects of multiple variants in the same genes have been largely 
ignored due to their complexity or lack of data. This paper uses HMMvar, a 
hidden Markov model based approach, to investigate the combined effect of 
multiple variants from the 1000 Genomes Project. Two tumor suppressor genes, 
TP53 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), are also studied for the joint 
effect of compensatory indel variants.
RESULTS: Results show that there are cases where the joint effect of having 
multiple variants in the same genes is significantly different from that of a 
single variant. The deleterious effect of a single indel variant can be 
alleviated by their compensatory indels in TP53 and PTEN. Compound mutations in 
two genes, Î²-MHC and MyBP-C, leading to severer cardiovascular disease compared 
to single mutations, are also validated.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper extends the functionality of HMMvar, a tool for 
assigning a quantitative score to a variant, to measure not only the deleterious 
effect of a single variant but also the joint effect of multiple variants. 
HMMvar is the first tool that can predict the functional effects of both single 
and general multiple variations on proteins. The precomputed scores for multiple 
variants from the 1000 Genomes Project and the HMMvar package are available at
