Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa and the sixth most 
affected by COVID-19 on the continent. Despite having experienced five infection 
waves, >499,000 cases, and ~7500 COVID-19-related deaths as of January 2023, 
there is still no detailed genomic epidemiological report on the introduction 
and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Ethiopia. In this study, we reconstructed and 
elucidated the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we investigated the 
introduction, local transmission, ongoing evolution, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 
during the first four infection waves using 353 high-quality near-whole genomes 
sampled in Ethiopia. Our results show that whereas viral introductions seeded 
the first wave, subsequent waves were seeded by local transmission. The B.1.480 
lineage emerged in the first wave and notably remained in circulation even after 
the emergence of the Alpha variant. The B.1.480 was outcompeted by the Delta 
variant. Notably, Ethiopia's lack of local sequencing capacity was further 
limited by sporadic, uneven, and insufficient sampling that limited the 
incorporation of genomic epidemiology in the epidemic public health response in 
Ethiopia. These results highlight Ethiopia's role in SARS-CoV-2 dissemination 
and the urgent need for balanced, near-real-time genomic sequencing.
