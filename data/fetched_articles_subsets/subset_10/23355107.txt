OBJECTIVE: to compare the combined role of genetic variants loci associated with 
risk of knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) in post-traumatic (PT) and non-traumatic 
(NT) cases of clinically severe OA leading to total joint replacement.
METHODS: A total of 1590 controls, 2168 total knee replacement (TKR) cases 
(33.2% PT) and 1567 total hip replacement (THR) cases (8.7% PT) from 2 UK 
cohorts were genotyped for 12 variants previously reported to be reproducibly 
associated with risk of knee or hip OA. A genetic risk score was generated and 
the association with PT and NT TKR and THR was assessed adjusting for 
covariates.
RESULTS: For THR, each additional genetic risk variant conferred lower risk 
among PT cases (OR=1.07, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19; p=0.24) than NT cases (OR 1.11, 
95% CI 1.06 to 1.17; p=1.55×10⁻⁵). In contrast, for TKR, each risk variant 
conferred slightly higher risk among PT cases (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.19; 
p=1.82×10⁻⁵) than among NT cases (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.1; p=0.00063).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the variants reported to date PT TKR cases have at least 
as high a genetic contribution as NT cases.
