Homozygosity for the mutation Cys282Tyr in the HFE gene has recently been 
identified as a cause of hereditary hemochromatosis, a disorder resulting in the 
inappropriate absorption of iron. Approximately 10% of Caucasians are 
heterozygous for this mutation; however, the gene frequency in African Americans 
is unknown. A study of a control population of African Americans was performed 
to determine the frequency of the Cys282Tyr and His63Asp alleles in this ethnic 
group. The carrier frequency for each mutant allele in our African American 
population was 3.0%. DNA studies of four African-American hemochromatosis 
patients did not identify any individuals with the Cys282Tyr allele. These 
findings suggest that if the Cys282Tyr mutation confers susceptibility to 
hemochromatosis in Caucasians (as suggested by recent studies) there is an 
alternative mechanism for hemochromatosis in the American black population.
