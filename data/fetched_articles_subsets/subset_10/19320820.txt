SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Recent studies have indicated that antithrombin (AT) 
possesses both anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of the 
intracellular signaling activities of AT using wild-type and mutant serpins that 
have reduced anticoagulant activities due to mutations in either the reactive 
center loop (RCL) or the heparin-binding site.
METHODS: Direct cellular effects of the AT derivatives were compared in the 
LPS-stimulated endothelial cells by employing permeability and neutrophil 
adhesion assays in the absence and presence of pertussis toxin (PTX) and siRNAs 
for either syndecan-4 or sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P(1)). 
Furthermore, the roles of prostacyclin and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in 
modulating these effects were investigated.
RESULTS: Both wild-type and the RCL mutant, AT/Proth-2, exhibited similar potent 
barrier protective activities and inhibited the adhesion of neutrophils to 
endothelial cells via inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway. Indomethacin 
abrogated both activities. The heparin-binding site mutants, AT-K114E and 
AT-K125E, did not exhibit any protective activity in either one of these assays, 
but a potent pro-apoptotic activity was observed for the AT-K114E in endothelial 
cells. Both PTX and siRNA for syndecan-4 inhibited the protective effect of AT, 
but the siRNA for S1P(1) was inconsequential.
CONCLUSIONS: The interaction of AT with syndecan-4 is required for its 
prostacyclin-dependent protective effect through a PTX-sensitive and 
non-S1P(1)-related G(i)-protein coupled receptor. The RCL mutant, AT/Proth-2, 
with a markedly reduced anticoagulant but normal protective signaling 
properties, may potentially be developed as a safer anti-inflammatory drug 
without increasing the risk of bleeding.
