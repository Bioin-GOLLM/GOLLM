While most patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) express either e13a2 or 
e14a2 BCR-ABL1 transcripts, a significant minority expresses variant 
transcripts, of which e19a2 is the most common. Although considered to have a 
relatively favourable outcome, reported responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI) therapy are variable with molecular monitoring in CML patients with e19a2 
BCR-ABL1 transcripts rarely reported. A case of e19a2 BCR-ABL1 CML with marked 
thrombocytosis is described in which the value of molecular monitoring is 
emphasised during treatment interruptions, dose reductions, and changes. This 
case serves to demonstrate the requirement for prospective real-time 
quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) assays for patients with variant BCR-ABL1 transcript 
types and standardisation of such assays to enable modern patient management.
