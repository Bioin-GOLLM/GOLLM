The emergence of COVID-19 has led to significant morbidity and mortality, with 
around seven million deaths worldwide as of February 2023. There are several 
risk factors such as age and sex that are associated with the development of 
severe symptoms due to COVID-19. There have been limited studies that have 
explored the role of sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a result, there 
is an urgent need to identify molecular features associated with sex and 
COVID-19 pathogenesis to develop more effective interventions to combat the 
ongoing pandemic. To address this gap, we explored sex-specific molecular 
factors in both mouse and human datasets. The host immune targets such as TLR7, 
IRF7, IRF5, and IL6, which are involved in the immune response against viral 
infections, and the sex-specific targets such as AR and ESSR were taken to 
investigate any possible link with the SARS-CoV-2 host receptors ACE2 and 
TMPRSS2. For the mouse analysis, a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset was used, 
while bulk RNA-Seq datasets were used to analyze the human clinical data. 
Additional databases such as the Database of Transcription Start Sites (DBTS), 
STRING-DB, and the Swiss Regulon Portal were used for further analysis. We 
identified a 6-gene signature that showed differential expression in males and 
females. Additionally, this gene signature showed potential prognostic utility 
by differentiating ICU patients from non-ICU patients due to COVID-19. Our study 
highlights the importance of assessing sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
which can assist in the optimal treatment and better vaccination strategies.
