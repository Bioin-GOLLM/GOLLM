The mammalian heart is derived from multiple cell lineages; however, our 
understanding of when and how the diverse cardiac cell types arise is limited. 
We mapped the origin of the embryonic mouse heart at single-cell resolution 
using a combination of transcriptomic, imaging, and genetic lineage labeling 
approaches. This mapping provided a transcriptional and anatomic definition of 
cardiac progenitor types. Furthermore, it revealed a cardiac progenitor pool 
that is anatomically and transcriptionally distinct from currently known cardiac 
progenitors. Besides contributing to cardiomyocytes, these cells also represent 
the earliest progenitor of the epicardium, a source of trophic factors and cells 
during cardiac development and injury. This study provides detailed insights 
into the formation of early cardiac cell types, with particular relevance to the 
development of cell-based cardiac regenerative therapies.
