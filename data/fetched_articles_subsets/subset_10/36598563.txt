This study provides a combined histochemical method for detecting enzyme 
activity of chloroacetate esterase simultaneously with immunolabeling of the 
components of a specific tissue microenvironment on formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded specimens. Chromogenic detection of the molecular targets 
within and outside the mast cells provides novel options in determining the 
histoarchitectonics of organ-specific mast cell populations, studying the 
functional significance of chloroacetate esterase and specifying the immune 
landscape of the tissue microenvironment.
