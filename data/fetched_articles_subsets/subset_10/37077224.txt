PURPOSE: We evaluate the effects of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 
polymorphisms on retinal tissue perfusion in patients with mild diabetic 
retinopathy (DR + PM) taking the medical food, Ocufolin®, for 6 months.
METHODS: Prospective, case-controlled study. Eight early diabetic retinopathy 
patients with common reduced function MTHFR polymorphisms (DR+PM) and 15 normal 
controls (NC) were recruited. MTHFR polymorphisms were subtyped as normal, 
C677T, or A1298C. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was evaluated. Retinal 
blood flow velocity (BFV) was measured using Retinal Function Imager. Retinal 
tissue perfusion (RTP, blood flow rate per inner retinal volume) was calculated 
within a 2.5 mm diameter circle centered on the fovea. The medical food is 
intended to address ocular ischemia with high doses of vitamin B-complexes and 
antioxidants, including L-methylfolate, methylcobalamin, zinc, copper, lutein, 
vitamins C, D, E, and n-acetylcysteine. The subjects were provided with a 
medical food for a period of 6 months.
RESULTS: BCVA and vascular indices of DR + PM patients at baseline were 
initially below those of NC and improved after medical food. Compared to 
baseline, DR + PM patients after the medical food had significantly improved 
BCVA during the follow-up period (P < 0.05). In comparison, overall RTP and 
arteriolar BFV were significantly increased at 6 months (P < 0.05). The changes 
varied with MTHFR subtypes. In patients with the C677T and the C677T/A1298C 
compound mutations, RTP was increased at 6 months as compared to that at 
baseline and 4 months (P < 0.05). In patients with only the A1298C mutation, all 
microcirculation metrics were increased from baseline at 4 and 6 months, but 
with less improvement at 6 months than at 4 months (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Medical food was effective in improving both visual acuity and 
retinal tissue perfusion in DR + PM patients. The degree of improvement of 
retinal microcirculation varied among MTHFR subtypes.
