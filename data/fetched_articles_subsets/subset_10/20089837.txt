Recruitment of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) to 
the cytosolic face of endosomes regulates selective inclusion of transmembrane 
proteins into the lumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). ESCRT-0, -I, 
and -II bind directly to ubiquitinated transmembrane cargoes of the MVB pathway, 
whereas polymerization of ESCRT-III at endosomes is thought to bend the membrane 
and/or provide the energetic force that drives membrane scission and detachment 
of vesicles into the endosome lumen. Disassembly of the ESCRT-III polymer and 
dissociation of its subunits from endosomes requires the Vps4 ATPase, the 
activity of which is controlled in vivo by regulatory proteins. We identify 
distinct spatiotemporal roles for Vps4-regulating proteins through examinations 
of subcellular localization and endosome morphology. Did2 plays a unique role in 
the regulation of MVB lumenal vesicle size, whereas Vtal and Vps60 promote 
efficient membrane scission and delivery of membrane to the endosome lumen. 
These morphological effects probably result from Vps4-mediated manipulations of 
ESCRT-III, because we show dissociation of ESCRT-0, -I, and -II from endosomes 
is not directly dependent on Vps4 activity.
