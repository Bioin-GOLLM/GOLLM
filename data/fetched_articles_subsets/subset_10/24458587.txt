Fetal hydrops is a condition resulting from interstitial fluid accumulation in 
fetal compartments secondary to increased capillary permeability and 
characterized by high rates of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Clinical 
features include skin edema, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, ascites with or 
without polyhydramnios, and placental edema. While it may occur as associated 
feature in multiple disorders, it has been documented to recur in Noonan 
syndrome, the most common disorder among RASopathies, but also in 
cardiofaciocutaneous and Costello syndromes. Here, we report on the occurrence 
of severe hydrops in a newborn heterozygous for the invariant c.4A>G missense 
change in SHOC2 which underlies Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair, 
documenting that it represents a clinically relevant complication in this 
condition, shared by RASopathies.
