OBJECTIVE: Upregulation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products 
(RAGE) has been proposed as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the 
development of atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to investigate if soluble 
RAGE levels are associated with AF in Caucasian patients.
METHODS: Patients (n = 587) were prospectively recruited and serum levels of 
soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE) measured. The 
patients included 527 with sinus rhythm, 32 with persistent AF (duration >7 
days, n = 32) and 28 with paroxysmal AF (duration <7 days, n = 28).
RESULTS: Patients with AF were older and had a greater prevalence of heart 
failure than patients in sinus rhythm. Circulating RAGE levels were higher in 
patients with persistent AF [median sRAGE 1190 (724-2041) pg/ml and median 
esRAGE 452 (288-932) pg/ml] compared with paroxysmal AF [sRAGE 799 (583-1033) 
pg/ml and esRAGE 279 (201-433) pg/ml, p â‰¤ 0.01] or sinus rhythm [sRAGE 782 
(576-1039) pg/ml and esRAGE 289 (192-412) pg/ml, p < 0.001]. In multivariable 
logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of persistent AF were age, 
heart failure, sRAGE [odds ratio 1.1 per 100 pg/ml, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.0-1.1, p = 0.001] and esRAGE [odds ratio 1.3 per 100 pg/ml, 95% CI 1.1-1.4, p 
< 0.001]. Heart failure and age were the only independent predictors of 
paroxysmal AF. In AF patients, sRAGE [odds ratio 1.1 per 100 pg/ml, 95% CI 
1.1-1.2, p = 0.007] and esRAGE [odds ratio 1.3 per 100 pg/ml, 95% CI 1.0-1.5, p 
= 0.017] independently predicted persistent compared with paroxysmal AF.
CONCLUSIONS: Soluble RAGE is elevated in Caucasian patients with AF, and both 
sRAGE and esRAGE predict the presence of persistent AF.
