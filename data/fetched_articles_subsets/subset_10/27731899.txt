Tau is a neuronal microtubule-binding protein that, in Alzheimer's disease and 
other neurodegenerative diseases, can form oligomeric and large fibrillar 
aggregates, which deposit in neurofibrillary tangles. Tau's physiological state 
of multimerization appears to vary across conditions, and a stable dimeric form 
of soluble tau has been suggested from experiments using recombinant tau 
in vitro. We tested if tau dimerization or oligomerization, also occurs in 
cells, and if soluble tau oligomers are relevant for the release and 
internalization of tau. We developed a sensitive tau split-luciferase assay to 
show the rapid intracellular formation of stable tau dimers that are released 
and taken up by cells. Our data further suggest that tau dimerization can be 
accelerated slightly by aggregation catalysts. We conclude that tau oligomers 
are a stable physiological form of tau, and that tau oligomerization does not 
necessarily lead to tau aggregation.
