BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL) -18 is crucial to host defense against 
mycobacterial infections. Recent studies have indicated IL-18 gene polymorphisms 
are associated with susceptibility to several clinical diseases.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the association of IL-18 
(-137G/C and -607C/A) gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 
susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB), and the effects of those SNPs to its 
protein producing capacity in Chinese Han population.
METHODS: 407 TB patients (including 113 children and 294 adults) and 469 healthy 
volunteers (including 167 children and 302 adults) from Chinese Han population 
were enrolled. The IL-18 gene promoter polymorphisms at positions of -137 and 
-607 were determined by sequence specific primer-polymerase chain reaction 
(SSP-PCR). The IL-18 levels in the supernatants of PBMCs from 46 healthy 
volunteers were measured by ELISA.
RESULTS: The gene distribution of IL-18 -137G/C and -607C/A showed none 
difference between adult and pediatric population. The frequency of IL-18 -137GG 
genotype was significantly higher in total TB group than that in total healthy 
control group (79.1% V 69.3%, P<0.01), while the frequencies of GC genotype and 
C allele were conversely lower (19.2% V 27.9%, P<0.01; 11.3% V 16.7%, P<0.01 
respectively). The difference of the -137CC genotype distribution between 
patients and controls was not observed. At the -607C/A polymorphic site, patient 
and control groups had a very similar gene distribution. Isolated PBMCs with 
IL-18 -137GC/CC genotype were able to produce a higher level of IL-18 than those 
with IL-18 -137GG genotype, either spontaneously or in response to PMA plus 
calcimycin A23187.
CONCLUSION: IL-18 -137G/C polymorphism contributed to TB susceptibility in 
Chinese Han population. Allele G might be a predisposing gene of TB, while 
allele C probably plays a role in preventing mycobacterium tuberculosis 
infection by promoting more vigorous protein expression.
