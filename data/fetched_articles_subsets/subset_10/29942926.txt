Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing syndrome is rarely caused 
by a pheochromocytoma. We present a case of a 46-year-old woman who developed 
severe hypertension, hypokalemia, and typical Cushingoid features. 
Investigations revealed extremely high metanephrine, cortisol, and ACTH levels. 
Imaging showed a 3.8-cm left adrenal mass. Preoperative control of hypertension 
and hypokalemia was very challenging. The patient was cured after surgical 
removal of the adrenal mass. We followed this by a review of the literature 
using the databases Google Scholar and PubMed. A total of 58 cases have been 
reported to date. In summary, ACTH-producing pheochromocytoma is a rare 
condition that poses a clinical challenge in the perioperative period. It is 
important that physicians be aware of such a condition because early recognition 
and treatment are crucial to decrease morbidity and mortality.
