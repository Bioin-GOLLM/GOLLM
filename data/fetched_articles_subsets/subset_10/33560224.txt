The hematopoietic system of Drosophila is a powerful genetic model for studying 
hematopoiesis, and vesicle trafficking is important for signal transduction 
during various developmental processes; however, its interaction with 
hematopoiesis is currently largely unknown. In this article, we selected three 
endosome markers, Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11, that play a key role in membrane 
trafficking and determined whether they participate in hematopoiesis. Inhibiting 
Rab5 or Rab11 in hemocytes or the cortical zone (CZ) significantly induced cell 
overproliferation and lamellocyte formation in circulating hemocytes and lymph 
glands and disrupted blood cell progenitor maintenance. Lamellocyte formation 
involves the JNK, Toll, and Ras/EGFR signaling pathways. Notably, lamellocyte 
formation was also associated with JNK-dependent autophagy. In conclusion, we 
identified Rab5 and Rab11 as novel regulators of hematopoiesis, and our results 
advance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of 
hematopoietic homeostasis as well as the pathology of blood disorders such as 
leukemia.
