BACKGROUND: Many published studies attempted to elucidate the implication of 
glucokinase regulator gene (GCKR) polymorphisms in the susceptibility to 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the results among them were still 
controversial.
OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aims to precisely assess the relationship between 
the GCKR polymorphisms and the risk of NAFLD.
METHODS: Systematic computerized searches in six databases were performed and 
updated on April 6, 2020. Meta-analyses were conducted by calling the R programs 
based on accumulated epidemiological data. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidential 
interval (CI) were calculated to summarize the effect estimates.
RESULTS: In total, 25 studies including 6,598 cases and 19,954 controls were 
included. The pooled estimates indicated that the T allele carrier of the GCKR 
rs780094 polymorphism has predisposition to NAFLD (allele model: OR: 1.20, 95% 
CI: 1.11~1.29; homozygote model: OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.15~1.67; heterozygote 
model: OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12~1.39; dominant model: OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.13~1.47; 
recessive model: OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.06~1.31), and the same as the rs1260326 
polymorphism (allele model: OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.22~1.42; homozygote model: OR: 
1.65, 95% CI: 1.40~1.94; heterozygote model: OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07~1.43; 
dominant model: OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.21~1.59; recessive model: OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 
1.28~1.62). Further stratified analyses according to age and ethnicity confirmed 
the statistical existence in most subgroups.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested that both of the GCKR rs780094 and 
rs1260326 polymorphisms are significantly associated with the increased risk of 
NAFLD.
