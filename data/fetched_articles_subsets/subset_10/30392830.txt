Intestinal reovirus infection can trigger T helper 1 (TH1) immunity to dietary 
antigen, raising the question of whether other viruses can have a similar 
impact. Here we show that the acute CW3 strain of murine norovirus, but not the 
persistent CR6 strain, induces TH1 immunity to dietary antigen. This property of 
CW3 is dependent on its major capsid protein, a virulence determinant. 
Transcriptional profiling of mesenteric lymph nodes following infection reveals 
an immunopathological signature that does not segregate with protective immunity 
but with loss of oral tolerance, in which interferon regulatory factor 1 is 
critical. These data show that viral capacity to trigger specific inflammatory 
pathways at sites where T cell responses to dietary antigens take place 
interferes with the development of tolerance to an oral antigen. Collectively, 
these data provide a foundation for the development of therapeutic strategies to 
prevent TH1-mediated complex immune disorders triggered by viral infections.
