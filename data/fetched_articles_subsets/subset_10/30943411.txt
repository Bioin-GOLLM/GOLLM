Activation of inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1α) is an indispensable step in 
remedying the cellular stress associated with lipid perturbation in the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. IRE1α is a single-spanning ER transmembrane 
protein possessing both kinase and endonuclease functions, and its activation 
can be fully achieved through the dimerization and/or oligomerization process. 
How IRE1α senses membrane lipid saturation remains largely unresolved. Using 
both computational and experimental tools, we systematically investigated the 
dimerization process of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of IRE1α and found that, 
with help of the serine 450 residue, the conserved tryptophan 457 residue 
buttresses the core dimerization interface of IRE1α-TMD. BiFC (bimolecular 
fluorescence complementation) experiments revealed that mutation on these 
residues abolished the saturated fatty acid-induced dimerization in the ER 
membrane and subsequently inactivated IRE1α activity in vivo. Therefore, our 
results suggest that the structural elements of IRE1α-TMD serve as a key sensor 
that detects membrane aberrancy.
