RASGRP1 is an important guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of the 
RAS-MAPK pathway following T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. The 
consequences of RASGRP1 mutations in humans are unknown. In a patient with 
recurrent bacterial and viral infections, born to healthy consanguineous 
parents, we used homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing to identify a 
biallelic stop-gain variant in RASGRP1. This variant segregated perfectly with 
the disease and has not been reported in genetic databases. RASGRP1 deficiency 
was associated in T cells and B cells with decreased phosphorylation of the 
extracellular-signal-regulated serine kinase ERK, which was restored following 
expression of wild-type RASGRP1. RASGRP1 deficiency also resulted in defective 
proliferation, activation and motility of T cells and B cells. RASGRP1-deficient 
natural killer (NK) cells exhibited impaired cytotoxicity with defective granule 
convergence and actin accumulation. Interaction proteomics identified the dynein 
light chain DYNLL1 as interacting with RASGRP1, which links RASGRP1 to 
cytoskeletal dynamics. RASGRP1-deficient cells showed decreased activation of 
the GTPase RhoA. Treatment with lenalidomide increased RhoA activity and 
reversed the migration and activation defects of RASGRP1-deficient lymphocytes.
