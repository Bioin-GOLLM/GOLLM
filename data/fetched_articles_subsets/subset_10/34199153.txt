Here we report on an EHV-1 outbreak investigation caused by a novel genotype 
H752 (histidine in amino acid position 752 of the ORF 30 gene). The outbreak 
involved 31 performance horses. Horses were monitored over a period of 35 days 
for clinical signs, therapeutic outcome and qPCR results of EHV-1 in blood and 
nasal secretions. The morbidity of the EHV-1 outbreak was 84% with 26 clinically 
infected horses displaying fever and less frequently anorexia and distal limb 
edema. Four horses showed mild transient neurological deficits. Clinically 
diseased horses experienced high viral load of EHV-1 in blood and/or nasal 
secretions via qPCR, while subclinically infected horses had detectable EHV-1 
mainly in nasal secretions. The majority of infected horses showed a rise in 
antibody titers to EHV-1 during the outbreak. All 31 horses were treated with 
valacyclovir, while clinically infected horses further received flunixin 
meglumine and sodium heparin. This investigation highlights various relevant 
aspects of an EHV-1 outbreak caused by a new H752 genotype: (i) importance of 
early detection of EHV-1 infection; (ii) diagnostic challenge to assess H752 
genotype; (iii) apparent benefit of valacyclovir use in the early stage of the 
outbreak; and (iv) weekly testing of blood and nasal secretions by qPCR in order 
to monitor individual infection status and lift quarantine.
