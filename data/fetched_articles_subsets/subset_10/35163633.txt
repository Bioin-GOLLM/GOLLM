Glioblastoma multiforme is the most lethal intrinsic brain tumor. Even with the 
existing treatment regimen of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, the median 
survival time is only 15-23 months. The invasive nature of this tumor makes its 
complete removal very difficult, leading to a high recurrence rate of over 90%. 
Drug delivery to glioblastoma is challenging because of the molecular and 
cellular heterogeneity of the tumor, its infiltrative nature, and the 
blood-brain barrier. Understanding the critical characteristics that restrict 
drug delivery to the tumor is necessary to develop platforms for the enhanced 
delivery of effective treatments. In this review, we address the impact of tumor 
invasion, the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of the tumor, and the 
blood-brain barrier on the delivery and distribution of drugs using potential 
therapeutic delivery options such as convection-enhanced delivery, controlled 
release systems, nanomaterial systems, peptide-based systems, and focused 
ultrasound.
