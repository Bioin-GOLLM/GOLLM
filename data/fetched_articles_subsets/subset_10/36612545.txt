Birds are potential carriers of pathogens affecting humans and agriculture. 
Aiming to evaluate the occurrence of the top three most important foodborne 
pathogens in free-living birds in Portugal, we investigated 108 individual fecal 
samples from free-living birds and one pooled sample of gull feces (n = 50) for 
the presence of Escherichia coli (pathogenic and non-pathogenic), Salmonella 
spp. and Campylobacter spp. Virulence- and antimicrobial resistance- (AMR) 
associated genes were detected by PCR and Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS), and 
phenotypic (serotyping and AMR profiles) characterization was performed. 
Overall, 8.9% of samples tested positive for pathogenic E. coli, 2.8% for 
Salmonella spp., and 9.9% for Campylobacter spp. AMR was performed on all 
pathogenic isolates and in a fraction of non-pathogenic E. coli, being detected 
in 25.9% of them. Ten of the tested E. coli isolates were multidrug-resistant 
(MDR), and seven of them were Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers. 
Among Salmonella (n = 3) and Campylobacter (n = 9), only one strain of C. jejuni 
was identified as MDR. Most of the identified serotypes/sequence types had 
already been found to be associated with human disease. These results show that 
free-living birds in Portugal may act as carriers of foodborne pathogens linked 
to human disease, some of them resistant to critically important antimicrobials.
