MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a psychostimulant popular as a 
recreational drug because of its effect on mood and social interactions. MDMA 
acts at dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) and serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) 
and is known to induce damage of dopamine and serotonin neurons. MDMA is often 
ingested with caffeine. Caffeine as a non-selective adenosine A1/A2A receptor 
antagonist affects dopaminergic and serotonergic transmissions. The aim of the 
present study was to determine the changes in DA and 5-HT release in the mouse 
striatum induced by MDMA and caffeine after their chronic administration. To 
find out whether caffeine aggravates MDMA neurotoxicity, the content of DA and 
5-HT, density of brain DAT and SERT, and oxidative damage of nuclear DNA were 
determined. Furthermore, the effect of caffeine on MDMA-induced changes in 
striatal dynorphin and enkephalin and on behavior was assessed. The DA and 5-HT 
release was determined with in vivo microdialysis, and the monoamine contents 
were measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection. DNA damage was assayed 
with the alkaline comet assay. DAT and SERT densities were determined by 
immunohistochemistry, while prodynorphin (PDYN) and proenkephalin were 
determined by quantitative PCR reactions. The behavioral changes were measured 
by the open-field (OF) test and novel object recognition (NOR) test. Caffeine 
potentiated MDMA-induced DA release while inhibiting 5-HT release in the mouse 
striatum. Caffeine also exacerbated the oxidative damage of nuclear DNA induced 
by MDMA but diminished DAT decrease in the striatum and worsened a decrease in 
SERT density produced by MDMA in the frontal cortex. Neither the striatal PDYN 
expression, increased by MDMA, nor exploratory and locomotor activities of mice, 
decreased by MDMA, were affected by caffeine. The exploration of novel object in 
the NOR test was diminished by MDMA and caffeine. Our data provide evidence that 
long-term caffeine administration has a powerful influence on functions of 
dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the mouse brain and on neurotoxic 
effects evoked by MDMA.
