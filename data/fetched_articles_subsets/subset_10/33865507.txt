BACKGROUND: In low-income and middle-income countries, affordable direct-acting 
antivirals are urgently needed to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The 
combination of ravidasvir, a pangenotypic non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) 
inhibitor, and sofosbuvir has shown efficacy and safety in patients with chronic 
HCV genotype 4 infection. STORM-C-1 trial aimed to assess the efficacy and 
safety of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir in a diverse population of adults 
chronically infected with HCV.
METHODS: STORM-C-1 is a two-stage, open-label, phase 2/3 single-arm clinical 
trial in six public academic and non-academic centres in Malaysia and four 
public academic and non-academic centres in Thailand. Patients with HCV with 
compensated cirrhosis (Metavir F4 and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A) or without 
cirrhosis (Metavir F0-3) aged 18-69 years were eligible to participate, 
regardless of HCV genotype, HIV infection status, previous interferon-based HCV 
treatment, or source of HCV infection. Once daily ravidasvir (200 mg) and 
sofosbuvir (400 mg) were prescribed for 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis 
and for 24 weeks for those with cirrhosis. The primary endpoint was sustained 
virological response at 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12; defined as HCV RNA <12 
IU/mL in Thailand and HCV RNA <15 IU/mL in Malaysia at 12 weeks after the end of 
treatment). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT02961426, and the National Medical Research Register of Malaysia, 
NMRR-16-747-29183.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 14, 2016, and June 5, 2017, 301 patients were enrolled in 
stage one of STORM-C-1. 98 (33%) patients had genotype 1a infection, 27 (9%) had 
genotype 1b infection, two (1%) had genotype 2 infection, 158 (52%) had genotype 
3 infection, and 16 (5%) had genotype 6 infection. 81 (27%) patients had 
compensated cirrhosis, 90 (30%) had HIV co-infection, and 99 (33%) had received 
previous interferon-based treatment. The most common treatment-emergent adverse 
events were pyrexia (35 [12%]), cough (26 [9%]), upper respiratory tract 
infection (23 [8%]), and headache (20 [7%]). There were no deaths or treatment 
discontinuations due to serious adverse events related to study drugs. Of the 
300 patients included in the full analysis set, 291 (97%; 95% CI 94-99) had 
SVR12. Of note, SVR12 was reported in 78 (96%) of 81 patients with cirrhosis and 
153 (97%) of 158 patients with genotype 3 infection, including 51 (96%) of 53 
patients with cirrhosis. There was no difference in SVR12 rates by HIV 
co-infection or previous interferon treatment.
INTERPRETATION: In this first stage, ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir was effective 
and well tolerated in this diverse adult population of patients with chronic HCV 
infection. Ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir has the potential to provide an additional 
affordable, simple, and efficacious public health tool for large-scale 
implementation to eliminate HCV as a cause of morbidity and mortality.
