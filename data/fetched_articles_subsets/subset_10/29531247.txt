Approximately 70% of breast cancers (BCs) express estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) 
and are treated with endocrine therapy. However, the effectiveness of this 
therapy is limited by innate or acquired resistance in approximately one-third 
of patients. Activating mutations in the ESR1 gene that encodes ERα promote 
critical resistance mechanisms. Here, we developed a high sensitivity approach 
based on enhanced-ice-COLD-PCR for detecting ESR1 mutations. The method produced 
an enrichment up to 100-fold and allowed the unambiguous detection of ESR1 
mutations even when they consisted of only 0.01% of the total ESR1 allelic 
fraction. After COLD-PCR enrichment, methods based on next-generation sequencing 
or droplet-digital PCR were employed to detect and quantify ESR1 mutations. We 
applied the method to detect ESR1 mutations in circulating free DNA from the 
plasma of 56 patients with metastatic ER-positive BC. Fifteen of these patients 
were found to have ESR1 mutations at codons 536-538. This study demonstrates the 
utility of the enhanced-ice-COLD-PCR approach for simplifying and improving the 
detection of ESR1 tumor mutations in liquid biopsies. Because of its high 
sensitivity, the approach may potentially be applicable to patients with 
non-metastatic disease.
