BACKGROUND: Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare inherited 
disease characterized by multiple calcified foci in the brain parenchyma. MYORG 
is the first gene found to be associated with autosomal recessive PFBC. The 
precise pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration in PFBC remains unclear. The 
clinical phenotypes of PFBC are variable, and there is no clear correlation 
between clinical manifestations and radiological and pathological features of 
calcification.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two sisters in a Taiwanese family presented with young-onset 
Parkinsonism and multifocal dystonia. Their brain CTs showed multiple 
intracerebral calcifications. The genetic study detected two heterozygous novel 
variants, c.104 T > A (p.Met35Lys) and c.850 T > C (p.Cys284Arg) in the MYORG 
gene. In both patients, MR susceptibility weighted images revealed calcification 
of the deep medullary veins. Tc99m ECD SPECT demonstrated a significant decrease 
of tracer uptake in the brain cortex and subcortical gray matter. Tc99m TRODAT-1 
SPECT revealed decreased tracer uptake in the bilateral striatum.
CONCLUSION: Two novel MYORG variants were identified in Taiwanese family members 
presenting with PFBC. Abnormalities in the brain perfusion and dopamine 
transporter SPECTs suggest that cerebral ischemia due to extensive calcified 
vasculopathy, disruption of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit, and 
nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction are plausible pathogenic mechanisms of 
neurodegeneration in PFBC patients. Further investigation into the correlations 
between the pathogenicity-implicated imaging findings and the clinical phenotype 
are recommended.
