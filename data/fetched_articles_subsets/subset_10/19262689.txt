WRN belongs to the RecQ family of DNA helicases and it plays a role in 
recombination, replication, telomere maintenance and long-patch base excision 
repair. Here, we demonstrate that WRN efficiently unwinds DNA substrates 
containing a 1-nucleotide gap in the translocating DNA strand, but when the gap 
size is increased to 3-nucleotides unwinding activity significantly declines. In 
contrast, E. coli UvrD (3'-->5' helicase), which recognizes nicks in DNA to 
initiate unwinding, does not unwind past a 1-nucleotide gap. This unique ability 
of WRN to bypass gaps supports its involvement in DNA replication and LP-BER 
where such gaps can be produced by glycosylases and the apurinic/apyrimidinic 
endonuclease 1 (APE1). Furthermore, we tested telomere repeat binding factor 2 
(TRF2), both variants 1 and 2 of protector of telomeres 1 (POT1v1 and POT1v2) 
and RPA on telomeric DNA substrates containing much bigger gaps than 
3-nucleotides in order to determine whether unwinding could be facilitated 
through WRN-protein interaction. Interestingly, POT1v1 and RPA are capable of 
stimulating WRN helicase on gapped DNA and 5'-overhang substrates, respectively.
