The title compound, C(38)H(30)OP(2)S·CH(2)Cl(2), belongs to the xanthene family 
of ligands containing S- and O-donor atoms in the central heterocylic ring. 
Positions 2 and 8 on the xanthene backbone are functionalized with methyl groups 
to allow for the selective functionalization of the backbone at positions 4 and 
6 with diphenyl-phosphanyl units. The title compound shows a significant 
'roof-like' bending along the axis of planarity involving the O- and S-donor 
atoms and the benzene rings, resulting in a dihedral angle between the mean 
planes of the benzene rings of 32.88 (13)°.
