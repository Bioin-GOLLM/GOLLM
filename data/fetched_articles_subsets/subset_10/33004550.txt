OBJECTIVE: Thiopurines are widely used as maintenance therapy in inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) but the evidence base for their use is sparse and their role 
increasingly questioned. Using the largest series reported to date, we assessed 
the long-term effectiveness of thiopurines in ulcerative colitis (UC) and 
Crohn's disease (CD), including their impact on need for surgery.
DESIGN: Outcomes were assessed in 11 928 patients (4968 UC, 6960 CD) in the UK 
IBD BioResource initiated on thiopurine monotherapy with the intention of 
maintaining medically induced remission. Effectiveness was assessed 
retrospectively using patient-level data and a definition that required 
avoidance of escalation to biological therapy or surgery while on thiopurines. 
Analyses included overall effectiveness, time-to-event analysis for treatment 
escalation and comparison of surgery rates in patients tolerant or intolerant of 
thiopurines.
RESULTS: Using 68 132 patient-years of exposure, thiopurine monotherapy appeared 
effective for the duration of treatment in 2617/4968 (52.7%) patients with UC 
compared with 2378/6960 (34.2%) patients with CD (p<0.0001). This difference was 
corroborated in a multivariable analysis: after adjusting for variables 
including treatment era, thiopurine monotherapy was less effective in CD than UC 
(OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.51, p<0.0001). Thiopurine intolerance was associated 
with increased risk of surgery in UC (HR 2.44, p<0.0001); with a more modest 
impact on need for surgery in CD (HR=1.23, p=0.0015).
CONCLUSION: Thiopurine monotherapy is an effective long-term treatment for UC 
but significantly less effective in CD.
