Plant viruses are a global concern for sustainable crop production. Among the 
currently available antiviral approaches, nanotechnology has been overwhelmingly 
playing an effective role in circumventing plant viruses. Alfalfa mosaic virus 
(AMV) was isolated and identified from symptomatic pepper plants in Egypt using 
symptomatology, serological tests using the direct ELISA technique, differential 
hosts and electron microscopy. The virus was biologically purified from a single 
local lesion that developed on Chenopodium amaranticolor. The AMV infection was 
further confirmed using an AMV coat protein-specific primer RT-PCR. We further 
evaluated the antiviral potential of chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs) and 
chitosan silver nanocomposites (CS-Ag NC) in different concentrations against 
AMV infections in pepper plants. All tested concentrations of CS-NPs and CS-Ag 
NC induced the inhibition of AMV systemically infected pepper plants when 
applied 24 h after virus inoculation. The foliar application of 400 ppm CS-NPs 
or 200 ppm CS-Ag NC produced the highest AMV inhibitory effect (90 and 91%) when 
applied 24 h after virus inoculation. Treatment with CS-NPs and CS-Ag NC 
considerably increased the phenol, proline and capsaicin contents compared to 
the infected plants. Moreover, the agronomic metrics (plant height, fresh and 
dry pod weights and number of pods per plant) were also significantly improved. 
According to our results, the potential applications of CS-NPs and CS-Ag NC may 
provide an effective therapeutic measure for better AMV and other related plant 
virus management.
