BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with poor 
survival. Although molecular and clinical characteristics have been established 
for SCLC in western patients, limited investigation has been performed for 
Chinese SCLC patients.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the genomic features of Chinese SCLC 
patients.
METHODS: A total of 75 SCLC patients were enrolled. Genomic alterations in 618 
selected genes were analyzed by targeted next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: Here, we showed that TP53 (77.30%) and RB1 (30.70%) were the most 
prevalent genes alterations, followed by KMT2D, ALK, LRP1B, EGFR, NOTCH3, AR, 
CREBBP, ROS1, and BRCA2. And the most common genetic alterations were enriched 
in the cell cycle signaling pathway (84.00%) of Chinese SCLC patients. DNA 
damage repair (DDR) pathway analysis showed that the most frequently enriched 
DDR pathways were fanconi anaemia (FA, 29.41%) and homology recombination (HR, 
21.57%). Notably, 9.33% SCLC patients in our cohort had pathogenic or likely 
pathogenic germline gene variants. Compared with the U Cologne cohort, a higher 
prevalence in EGFR, AR, BRCA2, TSC1, ATXN3, MET, MSH2, ERBB3 and FOXA1 were 
found in our cohort; while compared to the data from the Johns Hopkins cohort, a 
higher mutated frequency in TP53, KMT2D, ALK, and EGFR were found in our cohort. 
Moreover, a significant association was found between high tumor mutation burden 
(TMB) and mutations involved in TP53, CREBBP, EPHA3, KMT2D, ALK and RB1. 
Approximately 33.33% of patients with SCLC harbored at least one actionable 
alteration annotated by OncoKB, of which one patient had alterations of level 1; 
seventeen patients had level 3; fifteen patients possessed level 4.
CONCLUSION: Our data might provide an insightful meaning in targeted therapy for 
Chinese SCLC patients.
