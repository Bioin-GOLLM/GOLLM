BACKGROUND: Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a biomarker of airway inflammation. 
In the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis pathway, nitric oxide synthases (encoded by 
NOS1, NOS2A, and NOS3) and arginases (encoded by ARG1 and ARG2) compete for 
L-arginine. Although FeNO levels are higher in children with asthma/allergy, 
influence of these conditions on the relationships between variations in these 
genes and FeNO remains unknown. The aims of the study were to evaluate the role 
of genetic variations in nitric oxide synthases and arginases on FeNO in 
children and to assess the influence of asthma and respiratory allergy on these 
genetic associations.
METHODS: Among children (6-11 years) who participated in the southern California 
Children's Health Study, variations in these five genetic loci were 
characterized by tagSNPs. FeNO was measured in two consecutive years (N = 2298 
and 2515 in Years 1 and 2, respectively). Repeated measures analysis of variance 
was used to evaluate the associations between these genetic variants and FeNO.
RESULTS: Sequence variations in the NOS2A and ARG2 loci were globally associated 
with FeNO (P = 0.0002 and 0.01, respectively). The ARG2 association was tagged 
by intronic variant rs3742879 with stronger association with FeNO in asthmatic 
children (P-interaction = 0.01). The association of a NOS2A promoter haplotype 
with FeNO varied significantly by rs3742879 genotypes and by asthma.
CONCLUSION: Variants in the NO synthesis pathway genes jointly contribute to 
differences in FeNO concentrations. Some of these genetic influences were 
stronger in children with asthma. Further studies are required to confirm our 
findings.
