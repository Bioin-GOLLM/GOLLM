Molecular profiling studies of tumor tissue from patients with clear cell renal 
cell cancer (ccRCC) have revealed extensive metabolic reprogramming in this 
disease. Associations were found between metabolic reprogramming, 
histopathologic Fuhrman grade, and overall survival of patients. Large-scale 
genomics, proteomics, and metabolomic analyses have been performed to identify 
the molecular players in this process. Genes involved in glycolysis, the pentose 
phosphate pathway, glutamine metabolism, and lipogenesis were found to be 
upregulated in renal cell cancer (RCC) specimens as compared to normal tissue. 
Preclinical research indicates that mutations in VHL, FBP1, and the 
PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway drives aerobic glycolysis through transcriptional 
activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). Mechanistic studies revealed 
glutamine as an important source for de novo fatty acid synthesis through 
reductive carboxylation. Amplification of MYC drives reductive carboxylation. In 
this review, we present a detailed overview of the metabolic changes in RCC in 
conjunction with potential novel therapeutics. We discuss preclinical studies 
that have investigated targeted agents that interfere with various aspects of 
tumor cell metabolism and emphasize their impact specifically on glycolysis, 
lipogenesis, and tumor growth. Furthermore, we describe a number of phase 1 and 
2 clinical trials that have been conducted with these agents.
