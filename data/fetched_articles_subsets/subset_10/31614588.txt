Glial tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death and morbidity in 
children. Their diagnosis, mainly based on clinical and histopathological 
factors, is particularly challenging because of their high molecular 
heterogeneity. Thus, tumors with identical histotypes could result in variable 
biological behaviors and prognoses. The PATZ1 gene has been recently shown to be 
expressed in adult gliomas, including glioblastomas, where it correlates with 
the proneural subtype and with a better prognosis. Here, we analyzed the 
expression of PATZ1 in pediatric gliomas, first at mRNA level in a public 
database, and then at protein level, by immunohistochemistry, in a cohort of 52 
glial brain tumors from young patients aged from 6 months to 16 years. As for 
adult tumors, we show that PATZ1 is enriched in glial tumors compared to the 
normal brain, where it correlates positively and negatively with a proneural and 
mesenchymal signature, respectively. Moreover, we show that PATZ1 is expressed 
at variable levels in our cohort of tumors. Higher expression was detected in 
high-grade than low-grade gliomas, suggesting a correlation with the malignancy. 
Among high-grade gliomas, higher levels of PATZ1 have consistently been found to 
correlate with worse event-free survival. Therefore, our study may imply new 
diagnostic opportunities for pediatric gliomas.
