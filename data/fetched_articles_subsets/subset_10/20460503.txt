Active resolution of inflammation is a previously unrecognized process essential 
for tissue homeostasis. Monocytes play a pivotal role in the generation as well 
as resolution of inflammation. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used 
anti-inflammatory agents. We demonstrate that GCs exhibit antiapoptotic effects 
in monocytes resulting in differentiation to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. The 
molecular basis of this novel antiapoptotic effect is a prolonged activation of 
the extracellular signal regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(ERK/MAPK) pathway resulting in inhibition of caspase activities and expression 
of antiapoptotic genes via activation of c-Myc. We identified up-regulation and 
activation of A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) as the initial trigger of this 
antiapoptotic pathway. In summary, we deciphered a novel molecular pathway 
promoting survival of anti-inflammatory monocytes. Specific activation of A3AR 
or its downstream signaling pathways may thus be a novel strategy to modulate 
inflammation in autoimmune disorders with fewer side effects via induction of 
inflammatory resolution rather than immunosuppression.
