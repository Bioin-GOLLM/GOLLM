BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To expand the phenotype and genotype associated with 
PCYT2-related disorder.
METHODS: Exome sequencing data from a patient with molecularly undiagnosed 
complex spastic paraplegia and axonal motor and sensory polyneuropathy were 
analyzed. Clinical data and nerve conduction studies of the patient and his 
affected brother were collected, and their phenotype and genotype were compared 
with previously reported patients with PCYT2-related disorder.
RESULTS: A novel homozygous missense variant in PCYT2 (NM_001184917.2) c.88T>G; 
p.(Cys30Gly) was identified. This variant is located in a highly conserved 
tyrosine kinase site and is predicted damaging by several variant annotation 
tools. Both patients reported here and the previously published patients share 
several phenotypic features, including short stature, spastic tetraparesis, 
cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, and cognitive decline. Axonal polyneuropathy, 
diagnosed in both brothers, was not previously reported.
DISCUSSION: This family with a novel PCYT2 variant expands the clinical spectrum 
of PCYT2-related disorder to include axonal motor and sensory polyneuropathy and 
the genetic spectrum to include the variant located in the first catalytic 
domain, whereas all previously reported variants are located in the second 
catalytic domain. Further research is required to disentangle the underlying 
pathophysiologic mechanisms, leading to the complex phenotype of PCYT2-related 
disorder.
