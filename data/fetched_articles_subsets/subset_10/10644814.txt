BACKGROUND: The clinically important Kidd (JK) blood group antigens are carried 
by the urea transporter in red cells. The rare Jk(a-b-) phenotype can be caused 
by homozygosity at the JK locus for a silent allele, JK: This phenotype has been 
recorded in many ethnic groups, but it is most abundant among people originating 
from the Polynesian Islands and Finland. The molecular basis for Jk(a-b-) is 
unknown in these populations.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood samples from individuals of Swedish, Polynesian, 
and Finnish origin were collected and characterized by routine JK blood group 
serology and JK genotyping. Genomic DNA covering the exons and intervening 
introns of the JK gene coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, 
and fragments were directly sequenced.
RESULTS: Exon and partial intron sequences in the coding region of the JK gene 
were determined. Finnish and Polynesian Jk alleles were analyzed; the only 
deviations from consensus were a splice-site mutation (G-->A) in Polynesians, 
causing skipping of exon 6, and a T871C substitution predicted to disrupt a 
potential N-glyco-sylation motif (NSS-->NSP) in Finns. Methods for rapid 
detection of silent Jk alleles were developed for clinical application.
CONCLUSION: Polynesians and Finns have two different molecular alterations in 
their Jk alleles, both of which can now be determined by polymerase chain 
reaction.
