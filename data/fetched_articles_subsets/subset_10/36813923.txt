The VHL protein (pVHL) functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating the 
degradation or activation of protein substrates such as HIF1α and Akt. In human 
cancers harboring wild-type VHL, the aberrant downregulation of pVHL is 
frequently detected and critically contributes to tumor progression. However, 
the underlying mechanism by which the stability of pVHL is deregulated in these 
cancers remains elusive. Here, we identify cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and 
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) as two previously 
uncharacterized regulators of pVHL in multiple types of human cancers harboring 
wild-type VHL including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). PIN1 and CDK1 
cooperatively modulate the protein turnover of pVHL, thereby conferring tumor 
growth, chemotherapeutic resistance and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. 
Mechanistically, CDK1 directly phosphorylates pVHL at Ser80, which primes the 
recognition of pVHL by PIN1. PIN1 then binds to phosphorylated pVHL and 
facilitates the recruitment of the E3 ligase WSB1, therefore targeting pVHL for 
ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, the genetic ablation or 
pharmacological inhibition of CDK1 by RO-3306 and PIN1 by all-trans retinoic 
acid (ATRA), the standard care for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia could markedly 
suppress tumor growth, metastasis and sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic 
drugs in a pVHL dependent manner. The histological analyses show that PIN1 and 
CDK1 are highly expressed in TNBC samples, which negatively correlate with the 
expression of pVHL. Taken together, our findings reveal the previous 
unrecognized tumor-promoting function of CDK1/PIN1 axis through destabilizing 
pVHL and provide the preclinical evidence that targeting CDK1/PIN1 is an 
appealing strategy in the treatment of multiple cancers with wild-type VHL.
