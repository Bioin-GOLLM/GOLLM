Interplay between dopaminergic and cholinergic neuromodulation in the striatum 
is crucial for movement control, with prominent models proposing pro-kinetic and 
anti-kinetic effects of dopamine and acetylcholine release, respectively. 
However, the natural, movement-related signals of striatum cholinergic neurons 
and their relationship to simultaneous variations in dopamine signaling are 
unknown. Here, functional optical recordings in mice were used to establish 
rapid cholinergic signals in dorsal striatum during spontaneous movements. 
Bursts across the cholinergic population occurred at transitions between 
movement states and were marked by widespread network synchronization which 
diminished during sustained locomotion. Simultaneous cholinergic and 
dopaminergic recordings revealed distinct but coordinated sub-second signals, 
suggesting a new model where cholinergic population synchrony signals rapid 
changes in movement states while dopamine signals the drive to enact or sustain 
those states.
