Methods for site-specific modification of proteins should be quantitative and 
versatile with respect to the nature and size of the biological or chemical 
targets involved. They should require minimal modification of the target, and 
the underlying reactions should be completed in a reasonable amount of time 
under physiological conditions. Sortase-mediated transpeptidation reactions meet 
these criteria and are compatible with other labeling methods. Here we describe 
the expression and purification conditions for two sortase A enzymes that have 
different recognition sequences. We also provide a protocol that allows the 
functionalization of any given protein at its C terminus, or, for select 
proteins, at an internal site. The target protein is engineered with a 
sortase-recognition motif (LPXTG) at the place where modification is desired. 
Upon recognition, sortase cleaves the protein between the threonine and glycine 
residues, facilitating the attachment of an exogenously added oligoglycine 
peptide modified with the functional group of choice (e.g., fluorophore, biotin, 
protein or lipid). Expression and purification of sortase takes âˆ¼3 d, and 
sortase-mediated reactions take only a few minutes, but reaction times can be 
extended to increase yields.
