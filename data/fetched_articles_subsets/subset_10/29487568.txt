The growth hormone receptor (GHR), although most well known for regulating 
growth, has many other important biological functions including regulating 
metabolism and controlling physiological processes related to the hepatobiliary, 
cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems. In addition, 
growth hormone signaling is an important regulator of aging and plays a 
significant role in cancer development. Growth hormone activates the Janus 
kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling 
pathway, and recent studies have provided a new understanding of the mechanism 
of JAK2 activation by growth hormone binding to its receptor. JAK2 activation is 
required for growth hormone-mediated activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, and 
the negative regulation of JAK-STAT signaling comprises an important step in the 
control of this signaling pathway. The GHR also activates the Src family kinase 
signaling pathway independent of JAK2. This review covers the molecular 
mechanisms of GHR activation and signal transduction as well as the 
physiological consequences of growth hormone signaling.
