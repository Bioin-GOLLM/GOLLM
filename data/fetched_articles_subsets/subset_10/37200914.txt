INTRODUCTION: Probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum MC5 produces large amounts 
of exopolysaccharides (EPS), and its use as a compound fermentor can greatly 
improve the quality of fermented milk.
METHODS: To gain insight into the genomic characteristics of probiotic MC5 and 
reveal the relationship between its EPS biosynthetic phenotype and genotype, we 
analyzed the carbohydrate metabolic capacity, nucleotide sugar formation 
pathways, and EPS biosynthesis-related gene clusters of strain MC5 based on its 
whole genome sequence. Finally, we performed validation tests on the 
monosaccharides and disaccharides that strain MC5 may metabolize.
RESULTS: Genomic analysis showed that MC5 has seven nucleotide sugar 
biosynthesis pathways and 11 sugar-specific phosphate transport systems, 
suggesting that the strain can metabolize mannose, fructose, sucrose, 
cellobiose, glucose, lactose, and galactose. Validation results showed that 
strain MC5 can metabolize these seven sugars and produce significant amounts of 
EPS (> 250 mg/L). In addition, strain MC5 possesses two typical eps biosynthesis 
gene clusters, which include the conserved genes epsABCDE, wzx, and wzy, six key 
genes for polysaccharide biosynthesis, and one MC5-specific epsG gene.
DISCUSSION: These insights into the mechanism of EPS-MC5 biosynthesis can be 
used to promote the production of EPS through genetic engineering.
