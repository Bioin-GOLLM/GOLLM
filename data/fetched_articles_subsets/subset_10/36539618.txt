Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. We conducted 
a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 100,204 CRC cases and 154,587 
controls of European and east Asian ancestry, identifying 205 independent risk 
associations, of which 50 were unreported. We performed integrative genomic, 
transcriptomic and methylomic analyses across large bowel mucosa and other 
tissues. Transcriptome- and methylome-wide association studies revealed an 
additional 53 risk associations. We identified 155 high-confidence effector 
genes functionally linked to CRC risk, many of which had no previously 
established role in CRC. These have multiple different functions and 
specifically indicate that variation in normal colorectal homeostasis, 
proliferation, cell adhesion, migration, immunity and microbial interactions 
determines CRC risk. Crosstissue analyses indicated that over a third of 
effector genes most probably act outside the colonic mucosa. Our findings 
provide insights into colorectal oncogenesis and highlight potential targets 
across tissues for new CRC treatment and chemoprevention strategies.
