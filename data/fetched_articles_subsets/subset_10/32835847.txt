Enamel renal syndrome (ERS) or so-called amelogenesis imperfecta type IG is a 
very rare disorder characterized by the triad of amelogenesis imperfecta, 
gingival enlargement and nephrocalcinosis. It is caused by biallelic mutations 
in the FAM20A gene. Herein, we report two unrelated patients with ERS. Our 
patients presented with the characteristic features of the syndrome, and 
amelogenesis imperfecta and gingival hyperplasia were the main complaint. 
Strikingly, they both had long face, thick lips, notched upper central incisors, 
and thick alveolar ridge which have never been reported before in patients with 
ERS. Gingival biopsy showed psammomatous calcifications, and renal ultrasound 
revealed bilateral nephrocalcinosis in the two patients. Mutational analysis of 
the FAM20A gene identified two homozygous mutations including a novel one 
(c.915_918delCTTT, p.Phe305Leufs*76 and c.1219 + 3_1219+6delAGGT). Our data 
expand the phenotypic and mutational spectrum of FAM20A gene and reinforce the 
importance of kidney examination and follow up for all patients with 
amelogenesis imperfecta unless FAM20A mutations were ruled out.
