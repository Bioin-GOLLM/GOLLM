Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis was used to screen for 
mutations in exon 3 of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene in a group of 
218 unrelated patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol > 6.7 mmol/l) living in the Cologne area of Germany. Including the 
complementary primers the fragment studied had a length of 176 bp. An abnormal 
single-strand conformation polymorphism pattern was observed in eight patients, 
four of whom had an identical abnormal fragment pattern indicating that five 
different mutations were present. By direct DNA sequencing, the underlying 
mutations could be confirmed (Cys54-->Tyr, Trp66-->Gly, Glu80-->Lys, 2 bp 
insertion (AT between codon 44 and 45, 9 bp deletion (codons 65 to 67)). The 
analysis of the pathogenicity indicates that all mutations were causative for 
the low density lipoprotein cholesterol elevation. The Trp66-->Gly and 
Glu80-->Lys mutations were previously described in a French-Canadian population 
and in an English population, respectively. The 2 bp insertion was detected in 
four unrelated patients and is one of the most frequent mutations detected up to 
now in the German population.
