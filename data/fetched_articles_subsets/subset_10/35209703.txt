Precision oncology has fundamentally changed how we diagnose and treat cancer. 
In recent years, there has been a significant change in the management of 
patients with oncogene-addicted advanced-stage NSCLC. Increasing amounts of 
identifiable oncogene drivers have led to the development of molecularly 
targeted drugs. Undoubtedly, the future of thoracic oncology is shifting toward 
increased molecular testing and the use of targeted therapies. For the most 
part, these novel drugs have proven to be safe and effective. As with all great 
innovations, targeted therapies pose unique challenges. Drug toxicities, 
resistance, access, and costs are some of the expected obstacles that will need 
to be addressed. This review highlights some of the major challenges in the use 
of targeted therapies in NSCLC and provides guidance for the future strategies.
