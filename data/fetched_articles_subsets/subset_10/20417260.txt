Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) expresses the major surface glycoproteins F and G. 
We evaluated the protective efficacy of immunization with G. We generated a 
recombinant form of G ectodomain (GDeltaTM) that was secreted from mammalian 
cells and purified by affinity chromatography. We tested the immunogenicity of 
GDeltaTM in cotton rats. Animals were immunized with PBS, GDeltaTM alone or 
adjuvanted, or were infected once with HMPV, and challenged with live HMPV at 28 
days. Animals vaccinated with adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted GDeltaTM developed 
high levels of serum antibodies to both recombinant and native G protein; 
however, vaccinated animals did not develop neutralizing antibodies and were not 
protected against virus challenge. Unlike the analogous non-fusion glycoproteins 
of other human paramyxoviruses, HMPV G does not appear to be a protective 
antigen. This represents an unusual feature of HMPV.
