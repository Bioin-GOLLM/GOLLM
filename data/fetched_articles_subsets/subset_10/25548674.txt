Aim. Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that affects the teeth supporting 
structures, triggered by periodontal pathogens, and is influenced by 
environmental and genetic factors. Genes encoding molecules related to the 
immune response, such as cytokine, are the main candidates for polymorphisms 
analysis and may be possibly associated with this pathology. A G/C promoter 
polymorphism on the IL6 gene has been shown to affect basal IL-6 levels. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the association between the IL6 c.-174G>C 
polymorphism and periodontitis in individuals from Vitória da Conquista, Bahia, 
Brazil. Material and Methods. Three hundred and thirty individuals (134 cases, 
196 controls) were genotyped for the IL6 c.-174G>C by MS-PCR technique. 
Concentrations of salivary IL-6 were determined by ELISA method. Results. The 
IL6 c.-174G>C polymorphism was associated with periodontitis when comparing the 
distribution of genotypes between patients with periodontitis and control 
subjects. The GC genotype appeared as a protective factor for periodontitis. 
Results showed increased levels of salivary IL-6 in periodontitis patients. 
Nevertheless, there was no relationship between the concentrations of IL-6 and 
genotypes when comparing the case and control groups. Conclusions. Our data 
indicate an association between IL6 c.-174G>C polymorphism and periodontitis and 
showed that IL-6 may be considered an important marker for periodontitis.
