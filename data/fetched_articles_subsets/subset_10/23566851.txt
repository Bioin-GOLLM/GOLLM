Vascular malformations (VMs) are common congenital and neonatal 
dysmorphogenesis. VMs mostly occur sporadically with a few exceptions of 
inheritability. Tie2/angiopoietins-2 (Ang-2) and VEGF/KDR pathways are known to 
be involved in normal and pathogenic angiogenesis. Our study was aimed to test 
the contribution of these pathway gene variants to VMs. A total of 8 variants 
were found among 103 VM patients and 142 healthy controls. These variants 
comprised rs638203, rs639225, rs80338908 and rs80338909 in Tie2 gene, rs1870377 
and rs2305949 in KDR gene, rs79337921 and rs34590960 in ANTXR1 gene. Our results 
indicated that rs638203 (p=0.029) and rs639225 (p=0.018) in Tie2 gene were 
associated with VM. A further bioinformatics analysis suggested the rs638203-G 
and rs639225-G might cause an abnormal splicing of Tie2 gene into to a defective 
protein. Our results identified two novel Tie2 gene polymorphisms with genetic 
susceptibility to VMs, although future functional validation of the two 
polymorphisms is warranted in the future.
