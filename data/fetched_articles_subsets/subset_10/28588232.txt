Myogenic differentiation factor (MyoD) is a master transcription factor in 
muscle development and differentiation. Although several long non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) linked to MyoD have been found to influence muscle development, the 
functions of many lncRNAs have not been explored. Here we utilized lncRNA and 
mRNA microarray analysis to identify potential lncRNAs regulated by MyoD in 
muscle cells. A total of 997 differentially expressed lncRNAs (335 up-regulated 
and 662 down-regulated) and 1,817 differentially expressed mRNAs (148 
up-regulated and 1,669 down-regulated) were identified after MyoD knockdown in 
C2C12 cells. Functional predictions suggested that most lncRNAs are involved in 
the biological pathways related to muscle differentiation and cell cycle with 
co-expressed genes. To gain further insight into the MyoD-mediated lncRNA 
expression in muscle differentiation, tissue expression profiles and MyoD 
overexpression were performed, and we found one of the candidate 
lncRNAs-AK143003 was significantly regulated by MyoD. Further analyses showed 
its noncoding ability and cytoplasmic localisation. Silencing of AK143003 
stimulated the accumulation of myogenic marker genes, whereas AK143003 
overexpression led to their decreased synthesis. This study identified a 
multitude of MyoD-mediated lncRNAs for further investigation and identified a 
novel lncRNA, lnc-AK143003, which plays a role in controlling muscle 
differentiation.
