BACKGROUND: Inherited metabolic diseases (IMDs) are a group of individually rare 
single-gene diseases. For many IMDs, there is a paucity of high-quality evidence 
that evaluates the effectiveness of clinical interventions. Clinical 
effectiveness trials of IMD interventions could be supported through the 
development of core outcome sets (COSs), a recommended minimum set of 
standardized, high-quality outcomes and associated outcome measurement 
instruments to be incorporated by all trials in an area of study. We began the 
process of establishing pediatric COSs for two IMDs, medium-chain acyl-CoA 
dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency and phenylketonuria (PKU), by reviewing 
published literature to describe outcomes reported by authors, identify 
heterogeneity in outcomes across studies, and assemble a candidate list of 
outcomes.
METHODS: We used a comprehensive search strategy to identify primary studies and 
guidelines relevant to children with MCAD deficiency and PKU, extracting study 
characteristics and outcome information from eligible studies including outcome 
measurement instruments for select outcomes. Informed by an established 
framework and a previously published pediatric COS, outcomes were grouped into 
five, mutually-exclusive, a priori core areas: growth and development, life 
impact, pathophysiological manifestations, resource use, and death.
RESULTS: For MCAD deficiency, we identified 83 outcomes from 52 articles. The 
most frequently represented core area was pathophysiological manifestations, 
with 33 outcomes reported in 29/52 articles (56%). Death was the most frequently 
reported outcome. One-third of outcomes were reported by a single study. The 
most diversely measured outcome was cognition and intelligence/IQ for which 
eight unique measurement instruments were reported among 14 articles. For PKU, 
we identified 97 outcomes from 343 articles. The most frequently represented 
core area was pathophysiological manifestations with 31 outcomes reported in 
281/343 articles (82%). Phenylalanine concentration was the most frequently 
reported outcome. Sixteen percent of outcomes were reported by a single study. 
Similar to MCAD deficiency, the most diversely measured PKU outcome was 
cognition and intelligence/IQ with 39 different instruments reported among 82 
articles.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity of reported outcomes and outcome measurement 
instruments across published studies for both MCAD deficiency and PKU highlights 
the need for COSs for these diseases, to promote the use of meaningful outcomes 
and facilitate comparisons across studies.
