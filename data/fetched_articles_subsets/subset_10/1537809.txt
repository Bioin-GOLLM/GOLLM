The pheS5 mutation responsible for the thermosensitive phenylalanyl-tRNA 
synthetase of the classical Escherichia coli NP37 was cloned by a recombination 
event and identified by DNA sequence analysis. The mutation was subsequently 
verified by direct sequencing of amplified NP37 DNA generated by an asymmetric 
polymerase chain reaction. The resulting amino acid exchange, Gly-98 to Asp-98 
in the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase alpha subunit, might cause subunit 
disaggregation due to electrostatic repulsion.
