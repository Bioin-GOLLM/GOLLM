BACKGROUND: ENSANUT 2012 showed a combined prevalence of overweight and obesity 
of 34.4% in Mexican children. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the 
ADIPOQ and ADIPOR2 genes have been reported in many populations, but their 
association with obesity has not been confirmed in other studies. Our aim was to 
determine the association of SNPs from ADIPOQ and ADIPOR2 genes with obesity in 
Mexican children.
METHODS: A total of 2,634 children from 6 to 12 years old were enrolled in the 
study from four IMSS Units in Mexico City. We selected 1,469 unrelated children 
(745 normal weight and 724 overweight/obese). Phenotype characterization 
included anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, biochemical parameters, 
insulin concentrations and presence of acanthosis nigricans (AN). Analysis of 
the SNPs rs182052, rs266729, rs2241766, rs822393 of ADIPOQ and rs11061971 of 
ADIPOR2 was carried out in the DNA samples.
RESULTS: The study showed signiﬁcant differences (p <0.05) between groups in 
waist circumference, blood pressure, presence of AN, insulin concentrations, 
HOMA-IR, fasting glucose and lipid parameters, being higher in obese children. 
No associations in ADIPOQ variants with the presence of overweight/obesity were 
found. The presence of the variant rs11061971 of ADIPOR2 in children had a 
significant association with protection of overweight/obesity (OR 0.79, 95% CI 
0.68-0.93, p = 0.003). Also, the log-additive model confirmed the association by 
codominant and dominant models (p <0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of rs11061971 of ADIPOR2 variant confers protection 
against obesity and could be used as a marker in Mexican children.
