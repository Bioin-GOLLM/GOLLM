OBJECTIVE: Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that catalyzes the 
degradation of dopamine, is necessary for both motor and cognitive functions. 
Few studies have examined the association between COMT variants and cognition in 
patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
METHODS: We assessed a cohort of 409 PD patients without dementia who were 
regularly followed for two years. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 
(UPDRS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered at baseline 
and during the follow-up. The genetic variants and haplotypes of COMT, including 
rs6267, rs6269, rs4633, rs4818, and rs4680, were examined.
RESULTS: No association was observed between COMT genotypes and baseline 
cognitive function. After a mean follow-up period of 647.3 days, MMSE scores 
deteriorated with age. Cognitive decline correlated with age (P < 0.05) but not 
with the motor severity defined using UPDRS part III scores (P = 0.21). 
Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed that PD patients carrying the G allele of 
the rs6269 variant and COMT haplotypes constituting the G allele of rs6269 
showed a significantly more rapid decline in the MMSE scores over the follow-up 
period (log-rank test, P < 0.01). Cox proportional regression analysis adjusted 
for covariates revealed that among patients with PD, those carrying the 
high-COMT activity haplotype (G_C_C_G for rs6269, rs4633, rs4818, and rs4680) 
showed a high risk of cognitive decline (hazard ratio = 3.24; P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the high-COMT activity haplotype is 
associated with cognitive decline in patients with PD.
