BACKGROUND: RAD51 proteins, which are conserved in all eukaryotes, repair DNA 
double-strand breaks. This is critical to homologous chromosome pairing and 
recombination enabling successful reproduction. Work in Arabidopsis suggests 
that RAD51 also plays a role in plant defense; the Arabidopsis rad51 mutant is 
more susceptible to Pseudomonas syringae. However, the defense functions of 
RAD51 and the proteins interacting with RAD51 have not been thoroughly 
investigated in maize. Uncovering ligands of RAD51 would help to understand 
meiotic recombination and possibly the role of RAD51 in defense. This study used 
phage display, a tool for discovery of protein-protein interactions, to search 
for proteins interacting with maize RAD51A1.
RESULTS: Maize RAD51A1 was screened against a random phage library. Eleven short 
peptide sequences were recovered from 15 phages which bound ZmRAD51A1 in vitro; 
three sequences were found in multiple successfully binding phages. Nine of 
these phage interactions were verified in vitro through ELISA and/or dot 
blotting. BLAST searches did not reveal any maize proteins which contained the 
exact sequence of any of the selected phage peptides, although one of the 
selected phages had a strong alignment (E-value = 0.079) to a binding domain of 
maize BRCA2. Therefore, we designed 32 additional short peptides using amino 
acid sequences found in the predicted maize proteome. These peptides were not 
contained within phages. Of these synthesized peptides, 14 bound to ZmRAD51A1 in 
a dot blot experiment. These 14 sequences are found in known maize proteins 
including transcription factors putatively involved in defense.
CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal several peptides which bind ZmRAD51A1 and 
support a potential role for ZmRAD51A1 in transcriptional regulation and plant 
defense. This study also demonstrates the applicability of phage display to 
basic science questions, such as the search for binding partners of a known 
protein, and raises the possibility of an iterated approach to test peptide 
sequences that closely but imperfectly align with the selected phages.
