BACKGROUND: In the past few years, significant progress has been made in 
inhibiting neovascularization at the tumor site, cutting off the nutrient supply 
of the tumor, and inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. However, many 
proteins/peptides have the disadvantage of poor stability, short half-life, and 
uncertain targeting ability. Chemical modification can be used to overcome these 
disadvantages; many polyethylene glycol-modified proteins/peptides have been 
approved by US FDA. The purpose of this study was to obtain a novel 
anti-angiogenic chondroitin sulfate (CS)-peptide nanoparticle conjugate with 
efficient anti-neovascularization and tumor targeting ability and an acceptable 
half-life.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CS-ES2-AF nanoparticle conjugate was synthesized and 
characterized using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, transmission 
electron microscopy, and particle size and zeta potential analyzer. The 
anti-angiogenic ability was studied using MTT, migration, tube formation, and 
chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. The targeting ability of CS-ES2-AF was 
studied by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and bioimaging. The 
pharmacokinetics was also studied.
RESULTS: The CS-ES2-AF could self-assemble into stable nanoparticles in aqueous 
solution, which significantly enhances its anti-neovascularization activity, 
tumor targeting more explicit, and prolongs its half-life.
CONCLUSION: CS is an effective protein/peptide modifier, and CS-ES2-AF displayed 
good potential in tumor targeting therapy.
