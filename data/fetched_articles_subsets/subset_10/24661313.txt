BACKGROUND: Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) 
plays an important role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and 
thrombosis. This study is aimed at evaluating the potential association of 
3'-UTR-C188T and G501C in LOX-1 gene with cerebral infarction.
METHODS: A total of 386 patients with cerebral infarction and 386 healthy 
controls were included in the study, which were unrelated Chinese Han population 
in the Liaoning Province of northern China. The single nucleotide polymorphisms, 
3'-UTR-C188T and G501C, were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-ligation 
detection reaction method.
RESULTS: The frequencies of CC + GC genotype, GC genotype and C allele of G501C 
in the patients with cerebral infarction were significantly higher than those in 
the controls (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P = 0.04, respectively). The correlation still 
remained after adjusting for confounding risk factors of cerebral infarction. In 
addition, no significant association was observed between 3'-UTR-C188T and 
cerebral infarction.
CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that the G501C variant in LOX-1 gene may be 
associated with susceptibility to cerebral infarction, independent of other 
common risk factors, in northern Chinese Han population.
