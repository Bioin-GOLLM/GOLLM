Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as a rate-limiting metabolism enzyme of arachidonic 
acid has been found to be implicated in tumor occurrence, angiogenesis, 
metastasis as well as apoptosis inhibition, regarded as an attractive 
therapeutic target for cancer therapy. In our research, a series of 
dihydropyrazole derivatives containing benzo oxygen heterocycle and sulfonamide 
moieties were designed as highly potent and selective COX-2 inhibitors by 
computer-aided drug analysis of known COX-2 inhibitors. A total of 26 compounds 
were synthesized and evaluated COX-2 inhibition and pharmacological efficiency 
both in vitro and in vivo with multi-angle of view. Among them, compound 4b 
exhibited most excellent anti-proliferation activities against SW620 cells with 
IC50 of 0.86 ± 0.02 µM than Celecoxib (IC50 = 1.29 ± 0.04 µM). The results 
favored our rational design intention and provides compound 4b as an effective 
COX-2 inhibitor available for the development of colon tumor therapeutics.
