US28, a constitutively active G-protein-coupled receptor encoded by the human 
cytomegalovirus, leads to mechanistically unknown programmed cell death. Here we 
show that expression of wild-type US28 in human melanoma cells leads to 
apoptotic cell death via caspase 3 activation along with reduced cell 
proliferation. Reduced tumor growth upon US28 expression was observed in a 
xenograft mouse model. The signaling mute US28R129A showed a reduced 
antiproliferative effect. On evaluating different G-proteins coupled to US28 for 
signal transduction, Gα13 was identified as the main G-protein executing the 
apoptotic effect. Silencing of Gα13 but not Gαq resulted in a substantial 
increase in cell survival. Overexpression of Gα13 but not Gαq and their GTPase 
deficient forms Gα13Q226L and GαqQ209L, respectively, confirmed the requirement 
of Gα13 for US28 mediated cell death. Increasing expression of Gα13 alone 
induced cell death underscoring its relay function for US28 mediated decreased 
cell viability. Further reduced expression of Gα13 in melanoma cell lines 
isolated from advanced lesions and melanoma tissue was observed. These findings 
identified Gα13 as crucial for US28-induced cell death, substantiating that the 
effect of US28 on cell fate depends on preferred G-protein binding.
