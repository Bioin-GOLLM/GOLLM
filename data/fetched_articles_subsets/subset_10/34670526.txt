BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the causative agent of stomach 
diseases such as duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer, in this regard incomplete 
eradication of this bacterium has become to a serious concern. Probiotics are a 
group of the beneficial bacteria which increase the cure rate of H. pylori 
infections through various mechanisms such as competitive inhibition, 
co-aggregation ability, enhancing mucus production, production of bacteriocins, 
and modulating immune response.
RESULT: In this study, according to the received articles, the anti-H. pylori 
activities of probiotics were reviewed. Based on studies, administration of 
standard antibiotic therapy combined with probiotics plays an important role in 
the effective treatment of H. pylori infection. According to the literature, 
Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, and 
Saccharomyces boulardii can effectively eradicate H. pylori infection. Our 
results showed that in addition to decrease gastrointestinal symptoms, 
probiotics can reduce the side effects of antibiotics (especially diarrhea) by 
altering the intestinal microbiome.
CONCLUSION: Nevertheless, antagonist activities of probiotics are H. pylori 
strain-specific. In general, these bacteria can be used for therapeutic purposes 
such as adjuvant therapy, drug-delivery system, as well as enhancing immune 
system against H. pylori infection.
