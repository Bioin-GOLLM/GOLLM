Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) consists of a leukemia of two different 
lineages (myeloid, T, and/or B) co-occurring in the same tissue. 
KMT2A-rearrangement is rare and usually seen in B/myeloid MPAL. We report a 
unique case of T/myeloid MPAL with a t(v;11q23) KMT2A-rearrangement, with acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) in the bone marrow but concurrent T-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in lymph node and skin. Genomic interrogation 
suggests an undifferentiated stem cells with KMT2A rearrangement as the founder 
mutation that acquired additional lineage-specific mutations resulting in AML in 
the marrow and T-ALL in other sites.
