BACKGROUND: We report our experience of selecting tag SNPs in 35 genes involved 
in iron metabolism in a cohort study seeking to discover genetic modifiers of 
hereditary hemochromatosis.
METHODS: We combined our own and publicly available resequencing data with 
HapMap to maximise our coverage to select 384 SNPs in candidate genes suitable 
for typing on the Illumina platform.
RESULTS: Validation/design scores above 0.6 were not strongly correlated with 
SNP performance as estimated by Gentrain score. We contrasted results from two 
tag SNP selection algorithms, LDselect and Tagger. Varying r2 from 0.5 to 1.0 
produced a near linear correlation with the number of tag SNPs required. We 
examined the pattern of linkage disequilibrium of three levels of resequencing 
coverage for the transferrin gene and found HapMap phase 1 tag SNPs capture 45% 
of the > or = 3% MAF SNPs found in SeattleSNPs where there is nearly complete 
resequencing. Resequencing can reveal adjacent SNPs (within 60 bp) which may 
affect assay performance. We report the number of SNPs present within the region 
of six of our larger candidate genes, for different versions of stock genotyping 
assays.
CONCLUSION: A candidate gene approach should seek to maximise coverage, and this 
can be improved by adding to HapMap data any available sequencing data. Tag SNP 
software must be fast and flexible to data changes, since tag SNP selection 
involves iteration as investigators seek to satisfy the competing demands of 
coverage within and between populations, and typability on the technology 
platform chosen.
