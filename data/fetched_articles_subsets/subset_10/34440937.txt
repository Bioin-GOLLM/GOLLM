Angiogenesis is a critical process in the formation of new capillaries and a key 
participant in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis. Vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) stimulation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) 
facilitates angiogenesis and the progression of RA. Phosphorylation of 
sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) produces sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which 
increases inflammatory cytokine production, although the role of S1P in RA 
angiogenesis is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the impact of S1P treatment 
on VEGF-dependent angiogenesis in osteoblast-like cells (MG-63 cells) and the 
significance of SphK1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) on S1P production in an in vivo 
model. We found significantly higher levels of S1P and VEGF expression in 
synovial fluid from RA patients compared with those with osteoarthritis by ELISA 
analysis. Treating MG-63 cells with S1P increased VEGF production, while focal 
adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src siRNAs and inhibitors decreased VEGF production in 
S1P-treated MG-63 cells. Conditioned medium from S1P-treated osteoblasts 
significantly increased EPC tube formation and migration by inhibiting miR-16-5p 
synthesis via proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase src (c-Src) and FAK 
signaling in chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and Matrigel plug assays. 
Infection with SphK1 shRNA reduced angiogenesis, articular swelling and 
cartilage erosion in the ankle joints of mice with collagen-induced arthritis 
(CIA). S1P appears to have therapeutic potential in RA treatment.
