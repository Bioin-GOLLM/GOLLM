We report a novel mutation in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP I716V) 
which probably leads to familial early onset Alzheimer's disease with an onset 
age in the mid 50s. Cells transfected with cDNAs bearing this mutation produce 
more A beta 1-42(43) than those transfected with wild-type APP and this effect 
is additive with that of the previously reported APP V717I mutation thus 
providing a novel approach for further increasing A beta 1-42(43) in model 
systems.
