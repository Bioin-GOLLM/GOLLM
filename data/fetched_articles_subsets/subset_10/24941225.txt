BACKGROUND: Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (sCEA) level might be an indicator of 
disease. Indeed, an elevated sCEA level is a prognostic factor in colorectal 
cancer (CRC) patients. However, the genetic determinants of sCEA level in 
healthy and CRC population remains unclear. Thus we investigated the genetic 
markers associated with elevated serum sCEA level in these two populations and 
its clinical implications.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in a 
cohort study with 4,346 healthy male adults using the Illumina Omni 1 M chip. 
Candidate SNPs associated with elevated sCEA levels were validated in 194 CRC 
patients on ABI Taqman platform. Eight candidate SNPs were validated in CRC 
patients. The rs1047781 (chr19- FUT2) (A/T) was associated with elevated sCEA 
levels, and rs8176746 (chr9- ABO) was associated with the regional lymph 
metastasis in the CRC patients. The preoperative sCEA level was a risk factor 
for tumor recurrence in 5 years after operation (OR = 1.427, 95% CI: 
1.005∼1.843, P = 0.006). It was also one of the risk factors for regional lymph 
node metastasis (OR = 2.266, 95% CI: 1.196∼4.293, P = 0.012). The sCEA level in 
rs1047781-T carriers was higher than that in the A carriers in CRC patients 
without lymph node metastasis (P = 0.006). The regional lymph node metastasis in 
patients with homozygote AA of rs8176746 was more common than that in the 
heterozygote AG carriers (P = 0.022). In addition, rs1047781-AT and TT CRC 
patients exhibited a worse disease-free survival than AA genotype carriers 
(P = 0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: We found candidate SNPs associated with elevated sCEA levels in 
both healthy males and CRC population. Rs1047781 (chr19- FUT2) may be the 
susceptible locus for recurrence of CRC in a population from Southern China.
