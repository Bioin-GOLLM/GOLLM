BACKGROUND: Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is the most frequent type of 
nephrotic syndrome that occurs in children. Its response to treatment with 
steroids varies. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between 
steroid metabolism-related genes and the response to steroid treatment.
METHODS: The patient cohort comprised 74 children with INS, of whom were 58 
steroid-sensitive (SS) cases and 16 steroid-resistant (SR) cases. The genetic 
polymorphisms analyzed were those of the CYP3A5 gene (A6986G) and ABCB1 gene 
(C1236T, G2677T/A, and C3435T), and the polymorphisms between SS and SR children 
were compared.
RESULTS: C1236T in ABCB1 was associated with steroid resistance in INS children 
[odds ratio (OR) 2.65, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.01-6.94; p = 0.042] The 
frequency of the T allele was significantly higher in SR subjects than in SS 
subjects (0.81 vs. 0.62, respectively). A6986G in CYP3A5 showed a trend of 
association, but this association did not reach statistical significance (OR 
2.63, 95 % CI 0.94-7.37; p = 0.059). No significant correlation was found 
between treatment response and G2677T/A or C3435T in ABCB1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that among our pediatric patients with INS the 
C1236T polymorphism in the ABCB1 gene was associated with steroid resistance, 
while the A6986G polymorphism in the CYP3A5 gene showed a trend of association, 
but did not reach statistical significance, requiring further analysis.
