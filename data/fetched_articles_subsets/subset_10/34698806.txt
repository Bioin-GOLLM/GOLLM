Osteoporosis is caused by an imbalance of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, occurring 
in close proximity to hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Recurrent somatic 
mutations that lead to an expanded population of mutant blood cells is termed 
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Analyzing exome 
sequencing data from the UK Biobank, we found CHIP to be associated with 
increased incident osteoporosis diagnoses and decreased bone mineral density. In 
murine models, hematopoietic-specific mutations in Dnmt3a, the most commonly 
mutated gene in CHIP, decreased bone mass via increased osteoclastogenesis. 
Dnmt3a-/- demethylation opened chromatin and altered activity of inflammatory 
transcription factors. Bone loss was driven by proinflammatory cytokines, 
including Irf3-NF-κB-mediated IL-20 expression from Dnmt3a mutant macrophages. 
Increased osteoclastogenesis due to the Dnmt3a mutations was ameliorated by 
alendronate or IL-20 neutralization. These results demonstrate a novel source of 
osteoporosis-inducing inflammation.
