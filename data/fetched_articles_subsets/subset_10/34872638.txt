BACKGROUND: The CDKAL1 (CDK5 Regulatory Subunit Associated Protein 1 Like 1) 
gene encodes cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) regulatory subunit-associated 
proten1 like 1. This protein has been shown to contribute to the 
glucose-dependent regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic islets.
AIMS: The aim of our study was to analyze the effects of the rs7756992 genetic 
variant of CDKAL1 gene on fasting glucose and insulin resistance after weight 
loss secondary to partial meal replacement hypocaloric diet (pMRHD).
METHODS: This was a non-randomized, single-treatment study with a formula-diet 
in 44 obese subjects. The patients received nutritional education and a modified 
diet with two intakes of a normocaloric hyperproteic formula for 3-months. 
Anthropometric parameter and biochemical profile were measured at basal time and 
after 3 months. The variant of CDKAL1 gene rs7756992 was assessed.
RESULTS: The following genetic distribution was observed; [27AA (61.3%), 12 AG 
(27.3%) and 5 GG (11.4%)]. After the pMRHD, body weight, the body mass index 
(BMI), fat mass, waist circumference and blood pressure decreased in both 
genotypes. Non-G allele carriers showed a significant improvement in fasting 
glucose levels (AA vs. AG + GG) (-6.1 ± 1.4 md/dl vs. -1.2 ± 0.7 mg/dl; 
p = 0.01), fasting insulin levels (-3.6 ± 0.2 mU/l vs. -1.3 ± 0.6 mU/l; 
p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (-1.2 ± 0.2 units vs. -0.3 ± 0.2 units; p = 0.01). Fasting 
plasma glucose levels were higher in G allele carriers than non G allele 
carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the genetic variant (rs7756992) of CDKAL1 
gene is associated with glycaemic status after a pMRHD, with greater 
improvements in fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR in subjects without the G 
allele.
