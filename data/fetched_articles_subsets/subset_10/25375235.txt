Membrane proteins play key roles in biology. Determination of their structure in 
a membrane environment, however, is highly challenging. To address this 
challenge, we developed an approach that couples hydrogen/deuterium exchange of 
membrane proteins to rapid unfolding and detection by solution-state NMR 
spectroscopy. We show that the method allows analysis of the solvent protection 
of single residues in liposome-embedded proteins such as the 349-residue Tom40, 
the major protein translocation pore in the outer mitochondrial membrane, which 
has resisted structural analysis for many years.
