BACKGROUND: The significance of the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) Glu318Gly polymorphism 
has been described as either a causal mutation with reduced penetrance or a 
benign polymorphism. When this polymorphism is found in a symptomatic person 
with a family history of dementia, counseling on recurrence risk becomes very 
problematic.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that the PSEN1 Glu318Gly polymorphism should be 
interpreted cautiously.
DESIGN: Case histories of 2 patients with presenile dementia and family 
histories of dementia are described. The PSEN1 gene was sequenced in the 
patients and in 11 family members of patient 1.
RESULTS: Two patients with presenile dementia and personality change were found 
to carry the PSEN1 Glu318Gly polymorphism. The presence of the polymorphism was 
confirmed in several family members of patient 1 but was absent in 1 symptomatic 
relative.
CONCLUSIONS: The Glu318Gly polymorphism may be associated with risk for 
neurodegenerative disease; however, in the cases described here, it did not 
appear to be a risk factor. Until there is consensus on whether it is associated 
with disease, families should be informed that the clinical significance of the 
polymorphism is uncertain.
