A high prevalence of a common mutation in the Hfe gene (C282Y) has recently been 
reported in patients with the factor V Leiden mutation and a history of 
thrombosis. The aim of this study was to estimate the relative risk of venous 
thromboembolism in a large case-control study. 56/481 patients (11.6%) and 
57/497 controls (11.5%) were heterozygous for the C282Y allele giving an odds 
ratio of 1.02 (95%CI 0.69-1.51). 12/81 patients with the factor V Leiden 
mutation were heterozygous for the C282Y allele compared to 1/13 controls, odds 
ratio 2.09 (95%CI 0.25-17.6). An analysis of a further group of patients and 
controls selected for the factor V Leiden mutation did not indicate a higher 
prevalence of the C282Y allele in symptomatic patients, odds ratio 0.17 (95%CI 
0.34-0.81). This study does not support the hypothesis that the C282Y allele is 
an additional risk factor for venous thrombosis in patients with the factor V 
Leiden mutation.
