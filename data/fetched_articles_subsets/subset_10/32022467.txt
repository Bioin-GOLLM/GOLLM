OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of individual 
and combined single-nucleotide polymorphisms in brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF), dopamine transporter (DAT), and catechol-O-methyltransferase 
(COMT) genes with the occurrence of motor levodopa-induced complications (MLIC) 
in Parkinson's disease (PD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 76 patients with PD (MLIC occurred in 56.6%) 
and 60 controls. Allelic discrimination of rs6265 BDNF (Val66Met), rs397595 DAT 
(SLC6A3), and rs4680 COMT (Val158Met) genes were genotyped. Odds ratios (OR) and 
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using multinominal logistic 
regression. Orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) analysis and OPLS 
discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to analyze qualitative genetic data.
RESULTS: The risk of PD in subjects with the AG BDNF genotype was increased 
sixfold (OR = 6.12, 95% CI = 2.88-13.02, p < .0001), and AG BDNF and AG DAT 
genotypes were correlated with PD in OPLS-DA (VIP > 1). There were no 
differences in distributions of BDNF, DAT and COMT genotypes between PD groups 
with and without MLIC, while OPLS model showed that genotype combination of AG 
BDNF, AG DAT, and GG COMT was correlated with MLIC and genotypes combination of 
GG BDNF, AA DAT, and AA COMT with lack of MLIC in PD patients (VIP > 1).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the association of rs6265 BDNF (Val66Met) 
with the risk of PD and suggest a synergic effect of rs6265 BDNF (Val66Met), 
rs397595 DAT (SLC6A3), and rs4680 COMT (Val158Met) polymorphisms on the 
occurrence of MLIC.
