Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been confirmed to participate in 
different pathological processes, including cancer progression. However, the 
role and precise mechanism of action of the majority of circRNAs have not been 
elucidated in bladder cancer (BC). Here, we identified a novel circular RNA, 
termed circUBXN7, which was significantly downregulated in BC tissues compared 
with matched nontumor tissues. Importantly, we found that decreased circUBXN7 
expression was associated with pathological stage, grade and poor prognosis of 
BC patients. Functional experiments showed that circUBXN7 overexpression 
dramatically inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and 
suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, circUBXN7 could directly bind 
to miR-1247-3p and reverse the oncogenic effects induced by miR-1247-3p. 
Furthermore, B4GALT3 was predicted and confirmed to be a target of miR-1247-3p. 
Rescue experiments demonstrated that circUBXN7 abrogated miR-1247-3p-mediated 
inhibition of B4GALT3 expression. Finally, silencing of B4GALT3 promoted 
proliferation and invasion of BC cells; and partially abolished the tumor 
suppressive effects caused by circUBXN7. Taken together, our study revealed that 
circUBXN7 serves as a competitive endogenous RNA of miR-1247-3p to elevate 
B4GALT3 expression, consequently inhibiting cell viability and invasion in BC. 
The circUBXN7-miR-1247-3p-B4GALT3 regulatory network may provide a new 
perspective for gene-based treatment strategies for BC.
