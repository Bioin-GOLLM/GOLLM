Splicing and translation are highly regulated steps of gene expression. Altered 
expression of proteins involved in these processes can be deleterious. 
Therefore, the cell has many safeguards against such misregulation. We report 
that the oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1, which is overexpressed in many 
cancers, stabilizes the tumor suppressor protein p53 by abrogating its 
MDM2-dependent proteasomal degradation. We show that SRSF1 is a necessary 
component of an MDM2/ribosomal protein complex, separate from the ribosome, that 
functions in a p53-dependent ribosomal-stress checkpoint pathway. Consistent 
with the stabilization of p53, increased SRSF1 expression in primary human 
fibroblasts decreases cellular proliferation and ultimately triggers 
oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). These findings underscore the deleterious 
outcome of SRSF1 overexpression and identify a cellular defense mechanism 
against its aberrant function. Furthermore, they implicate the RPL5-MDM2 complex 
in OIS and demonstrate a link between spliceosomal and ribosomal components, 
functioning independently of their canonical roles, to monitor cellular 
physiology and cell-cycle progression.
