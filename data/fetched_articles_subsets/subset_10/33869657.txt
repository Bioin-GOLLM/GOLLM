A key factor for developing gene therapy strategies for neurological disorders 
is the availability of suitable vectors. Currently, the most advanced are 
adeno-associated vectors that, while being safe and ensuring long-lasting 
transgene expression, have a very limited cargo capacity. In contrast, herpes 
simplex virus-based amplicon vectors can host huge amounts of foreign DNA, but 
concerns exist about their safety and ability to express transgenes long-term. 
We aimed at modulating and prolonging amplicon-induced transgene expression 
kinetics in vivo using different promoters and preventing transgene silencing. 
To pursue the latter, we deleted bacterial DNA sequences derived from vector 
construction and shielded the transgene cassette using AT-rich and 
insulator-like sequences (SAm technology). We employed luciferase and GFP as 
reporter genes. To determine transgene expression kinetics, we injected vectors 
in the hippocampus of mice that were longitudinally scanned for bioluminescence 
for 6 months. To evaluate safety, we analyzed multiple markers of damage and 
performed patch clamp electrophysiology experiments. All vectors proved safe, 
and we managed to modulate the duration of transgene expression, up to obtaining 
a stable, long-lasting expression using the SAm technology. Therefore, these 
amplicon vectors represent a flexible, efficient, and safe tool for gene 
delivery in the brain.
