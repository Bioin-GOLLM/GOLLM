Calcium (Ca2+) is a ubiquitous and fundamental signaling component that is 
utilized by cells to regulate a diverse range of cellular functions, such as 
insulin secretion from pancreatic Î²-cells of the islets of Langerhans. Cyclic 
ADP-ribose (cADPR), synthesized from NAD+ by ADP-ribosyl cyclase family 
proteins, such as the mammalian cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38), is 
important for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization for cell functioning. cADPR 
induces Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum via the ryanodine receptor 
intracellular Ca2+ channel complex, in which the FK506-binding protein 12.6 
works as a cADPR-binding regulatory protein. Recently, involvements of the 
CD38-cADPR signal system in several human diseases and animal models have been 
reported. This review describes the biochemical and molecular biological basis 
of the CD38-cADPR signal system and the diseases caused by its abnormalities.
