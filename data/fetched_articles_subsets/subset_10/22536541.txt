Background. Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD) is an immune-mediated systemic 
disease with quotidian-spiking fever, rash, and inflammatory arthritis. 
Hyperferritinemia is a prominent feature, often used for screening. Methods. The 
key terms "ferritin" and "hyperferritinemia" were used to search PubMed and 
Medline and were cross-referenced with "Still's Disease." Results. 
Hyperferritinemia, although nonspecific, is particularly prevalent in AOSD. 
While most clinicians associate ferritin with iron metabolism, this is mostly 
true for the H isoform and not for the L isoform that tends to increase 
dramatically in hyperferritenemia. In these situations, hyperferritinemia is not 
associated with iron metabolism and may even mask an underlying iron deficiency. 
We review, in systematic fashion, the current basic science and clinical 
literature regarding the regulation of ferritin and its use in the diagnosis and 
management of AOSD. Conclusion. Serum hyperferritinemia in AOSD has been 
described for 2 decades, although its mechanism has not yet been completely 
elucidated. Regulation by proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1b, 
IL-6, IL-18, MCSF, and INF-Î± provides a link to the disease pathogenesis and may 
explain rapid resolution of hyperferritinemia after targeted treatment and 
inhibition of key cytokines.
