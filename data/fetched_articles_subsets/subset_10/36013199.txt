BACKGROUND: Recent years have witnessed the advent of molecular profiling for 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), and new techniques have led to the 
identification of several molecular alterations. Precision oncology approaches 
have been widely evaluated and are currently under assessment, as shown by the 
recent development of a wide range of agents targeting Fibroblast Growth Factor 
Receptor (FGFR) 2, Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1), and BRAF. However, 
several knowledge gaps persist in the understanding of the genomic landscape of 
this hepatobiliary malignancy.
METHODS: In the current study, we aimed to comprehensively analyze 
clinicopathological features of BAP1-mutated iCCA patients in public datasets to 
increase the current knowledge on the molecular and biological profile of iCCA.
RESULTS: The current database study, including 772 iCCAs, identified BAP1 
mutations in 120 cases (15.7%). According to our analysis, no differences in 
terms of overall survival and relapse-free survival were observed between 
BAP1-mutated and BAP1 wild-type patients receiving radical surgery. In addition, 
IDH1, PBRM1, and ARID1A mutations were the most commonly co-altered genes in 
BAP1-mutated iCCAs.
CONCLUSIONS: The genomic characterization of iCCA is destined to become 
increasingly important, and more efforts aimed to implement iCCA genomics 
analysis are warranted.
