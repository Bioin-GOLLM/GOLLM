OBJECTIVE: HER2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, was originally identified based on 
its role in cancer research. The protein has subsequently received attention for 
its role in nerve injury and neurodevelopment. We investigated the polymorphic 
association of HER2 variants at amino acid residues 655 and 1170 with 
Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify DNA 
samples from PD patients and control subjects. The resulting PCR fragments, 
which spanned HER2 residues 655 and 1170, were analyzed by restriction fragment 
length polymorphism and/or direct nucleotide sequencing.
RESULTS: The genetic distribution at residue 655 in PD patients did not differ 
from that in controls. However, homozygosity for genes encoding Pro at residue 
1170 (Pro/Pro) occurred at a significantly lower rate among PD subjects. In 
other words, Ala-allele carries higher frequency in PD, especially among female 
PD subjects.
CONCLUSION: Different signals or potency of the kinase activities resulting from 
the Ala1170Pro allele of HER2 may be associated with vulnerability to stress on 
dopaminergic neurons in PD.
