Compelling evidence shows that brown and beige adipose tissue are protective 
against metabolic diseases1,2. PR domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) is a dominant 
activator of the biogenesis of beige adipocytes by forming a complex with 
transcriptional and epigenetic factors and is therefore an attractive target for 
improving metabolic health3-8. However, a lack of knowledge surrounding the 
regulation of PRDM16 protein expression hampered us from selectively targeting 
this transcriptional pathway. Here we identify CUL2-APPBP2 as the ubiquitin E3 
ligase that determines PRDM16 protein stability by catalysing its 
polyubiquitination. Inhibition of CUL2-APPBP2 sufficiently extended the 
half-life of PRDM16 protein and promoted beige adipocyte biogenesis. By 
contrast, elevated CUL2-APPBP2 expression was found in aged adipose tissues and 
repressed adipocyte thermogenesis by degrading PRDM16 protein. Importantly, 
extended PRDM16 protein stability by adipocyte-specific deletion of CUL2-APPBP2 
counteracted diet-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and 
dyslipidaemia in mice. These results offer a cell-autonomous route to 
selectively activate the PRDM16 pathway in adipose tissues.
