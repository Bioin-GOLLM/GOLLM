BACKGROUND: 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] deficiency in patients with 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) has long been noted, but identifying the exact 
causal relationship remains hard. Investigation of the causality between 25(OH)D 
deficiency and OSA would help facilitate disease prevention.
METHODS: We conducted a two-sample bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) 
study. For forward analysis, 237 newly identified genetic variants are used as 
proxies for 25(OH)D to estimate the unconfounded effect on OSA among 16,761 OSA 
cases and 201,194 controls of European ancestry. Reverse analysis was performed 
to detect the causal impact of OSA on 25(OH)D levels. The inverse variance 
weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis was 
performed to evaluate the robustness of our results. Multivariate MR analysis 
was conducted to evaluate the direct link between 25(OH)D and OSA after 
accounting for body mass index (BMI).
RESULTS: IVW indicated that OSA causally associated with a lower level of 
25(OH)D ((β = -0.03, 95% CI = -0.06 ~ -0.007, P = 0.01). No evidence of the 
causal link from 25(OH)D to OSA was detected (OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.88 ~ 1.12, 
P = 0.85). Sensitivity analysis suggested the MR estimates were not biased. 
Multivariate MR analysis indicated the effect of OSA on 25(OH)D vanished upon 
accounting for BMI (β = -0.011, 95% CI = -0.028 ~ 0.007, P = 0.23).
CONCLUSION: This MR study provided evidence that OSA was causally associated 
with a lower level of 25(OH)D, which might be driven by BMI. Obesity management 
should be enhanced in patients with OSA to prevent 25(OH)D deficiency.
