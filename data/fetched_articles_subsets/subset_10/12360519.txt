At neutral pH, equine beta-lactoglobulin (ELG) is monomeric, whereas bovine 
beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) exists as a dimer. To understand the difference in the 
oligomerization properties between ELG and BLG, three mutants of ELG (LP, I, and 
LPI) were constructed by substituting amino acids responsible for important 
interactions at the dimer interface of BLG into ELG. The mutant LP has an AB 
loop mutation (S34A/E35Q), the mutant I has an I strand mutation 
(G145M/R146H/V147I/Q148R/I149L/V150S/P151F/D152N/L153P) and the mutant LPI 
includes both the LP and I mutations. The far- and near-UV CD spectra of the 
three mutants are similar to that of the wild-type ELG, indicating that the 
secondary and the tertiary structures of ELG are not significantly affected by 
the mutations. Ultracentrifuge analysis shows that all three mutants are 
monomeric at neutral pH, suggesting that the protein sequences in the AB loop 
and I strand of BLG alone cannot support dimerization of ELG. Thus, structural 
differences must exist between ELG and BLG that prevent the ELG mutants from 
forming the same interactions as BLG at the dimer interface.
