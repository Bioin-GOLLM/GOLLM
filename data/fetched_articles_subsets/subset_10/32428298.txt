Human histone deacetylase 8 is a well-recognized target for T-cell lymphoma and 
particularly childhood neuroblastoma. PD-404,182 was shown to be a selective 
covalent inhibitor of HDAC8 that forms mixed disulfides with several cysteine 
residues and is also able to transform thiol groups to thiocyanates. Moreover, 
HDAC8 was shown to be regulated by a redox switch based on the reversible 
formation of a disulfide bond between cysteines Cys102 and Cys153 . This study 
on the distinct effects of PD-404,182 on HDAC8 reveals that this compound 
induces the dose-dependent formation of intramolecular disulfide bridges. 
Therefore, the inhibition mechanism of HDAC8 by PD-404,182 involves both, 
covalent modification of thiols as well as ligand mediated disulfide formation. 
Moreover, this study provides a deep molecular insight into the regulation 
mechanism of HDAC8 involving several cysteines with graduated capability to form 
reversible disulfide bridges.
