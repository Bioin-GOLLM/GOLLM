BACKGROUND: The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently altered gene 
in tumors and mutant p53 gain-of-function isoforms actively promote cancer 
malignancy.
METHODS: A panel of wild-type and mutant p53 cancer cell lines of different 
tissues, including pancreas, breast, skin, and lung were used, as well as 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with different TP53 gene status. The 
effects of mutant p53 were evaluated by confocal microscopy, reactive oxygen 
species production assay, immunoblotting, and quantitative reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction after cellular transfection.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that oncogenic mutant p53 isoforms are able to inhibit 
SESN1 expression and consequently the amount of SESN1/AMPK complex, resulting in 
the downregulation of the AMPK/PGC-1α/UCP2 axis and mitochondrial O2-· 
production. We also show a correlation between the decrease of reduced thiols 
with a poorer clinical outcome of CLL patients bearing mutant TP53 gene. The 
restoration of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) expression, as well 
as the addition of the radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine, reversed the 
oncogenic effects of mutant p53 as cellular hyper-proliferation, antiapoptotic 
effect, and resistance to drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of the SESN1/AMPK/PGC-1α/UCP2 axis contributes to 
the pro-oxidant and oncogenic effects of mutant p53, suggesting pro-oxidant 
drugs as a therapeutic approach for cancer patients bearing mutant TP53 gene.
