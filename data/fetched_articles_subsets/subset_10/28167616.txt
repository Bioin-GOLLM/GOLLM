The research domain criteria (RDoC) matrix has been developed to reorient 
psychiatric research towards measurable behavioral dimensions and underlying 
mechanisms. Here, we used a new genetic rat model with a loss-of-function point 
mutation in the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene (Slc6a3_N157K) to systematically 
study the RDoC matrix. First, we examined the impact of the Slc6a3_N157K 
mutation on monoaminergic signaling. We then performed behavioral tests 
representing each of the five RDoC domains: negative and positive valence 
systems, cognitive, social and arousal/regulatory systems. The use of RDoC may 
be particularly helpful for drug development. We studied the effects of a novel 
pharmacological approach metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2/3 antagonism, in 
DAT mutants in a comparative way with standard medications. Loss of DAT 
functionality in mutant rats not only elevated subcortical extracellular 
dopamine concentration but also altered the balance of monoaminergic 
transmission. DAT mutant rats showed deficits in all five RDoC domains. Thus, 
mutant rats failed to show conditioned fear responses, were anhedonic, were 
unable to learn stimulus-reward associations, showed impaired cognition and 
social behavior, and were hyperactive. Hyperactivity in mutant rats was reduced 
by amphetamine and atomoxetine, which are well-established medications to reduce 
hyperactivity in humans. The mGluR2/3 antagonist LY341495 also normalized 
hyperactivity in DAT mutant rats without affecting extracellular dopamine 
levels. We systematically characterized an altered dopamine system within the 
context of the RDoC matrix and studied mGluR2/3 antagonism as a new 
pharmacological strategy to treat mental disorders with underlying subcortical 
dopaminergic hyperactivity.
