Immunoglobulin (Ig) M is the first antibody isotype to appear during evolution, 
ontogeny and immune responses. IgM not only serves as the first line of host 
defense against infections but also plays an important role in immune regulation 
and immunological tolerance. For many years, IgM is thought to function by 
binding to antigen and activating complement system. With the discovery of the 
IgM Fc receptor (FcμR), it is now clear that IgM can also elicit its function 
through FcμR. In this review, we will describe the molecular characteristics of 
FcμR, its role in B cell development, maturation and activation, humoral immune 
responses, host defense, and immunological tolerance. We will also discuss the 
functional relationship between IgM-complement and IgM-FcμR pathways in 
regulating immunity and tolerance. Finally, we will discuss the potential 
involvement of FcμR in human diseases.
