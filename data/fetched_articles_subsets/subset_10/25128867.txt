OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase (TIMP) gene polymorphisms with unexplained recurrent 
spontaneous abortions (URSA) in a well-defined group of Han Chinese couples.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a case-control association study. Genomic DNA was 
extracted from peripheral blood samples from 84 couples with histories of three 
or more pregnancy losses and 69 age-matched healthy couples with at least one 
live birth and no histories of pregnancy loss. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) 
and sequencing with the fluorescent dye dideoxy-termination method were used to 
detect the rs4898 in TIMP-1, rs2277698 in TIMP-2, rs2234921 and rs5749511 in 
TIMP-3 and rs17035945 in TIMP-4 genotypes and allele frequencies.
RESULTS: Neither the allele frequencies nor any of the genetic model of the five 
TIMP gene SNPs (i.e., TIMP-1-rs4898, TIMP-2-rs2277698, TIMP-3-rs5749511 and 
rs2234921, and TIMP-4-rs7035945) were significantly differences between the URSA 
couples and the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found for any associations between the 
TIMP-1,-2,-3, or -4 genes SNPs with URSA in this Han Chinese Han.
