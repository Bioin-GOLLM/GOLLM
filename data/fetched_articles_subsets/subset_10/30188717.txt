We report the first evidence of GEX1A, a polyketide known to modulate 
alternative pre-mRNA splicing, as a potential treatment for Niemann-Pick type C 
disease. GEX1A was isolated from its producing organism, Streptomyces 
chromofuscus, and screened in NPC1 mutant cells alongside several semisynthetic 
analogues. We found that GEX1A and analogues are capable of restoring 
cholesterol trafficking in NPC1 mutant fibroblasts, as well as altering the 
expression of NPC1 isoforms detected by Western blot. These results, along with 
the compound's favorable pharmacokinetic properties, highlight the potential of 
spliceosome-targeting scaffolds such as GEX1A for the treatment of genetic 
diseases.
