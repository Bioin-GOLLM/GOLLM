Engineering functional human cardiac tissue that mimics the native adult 
morphological and functional phenotype has been a long held objective. In the 
last 5 years, the field of cardiac tissue engineering has transitioned from 
cardiac tissues derived from various animal species to the production of the 
first generation of human engineered cardiac tissues (hECTs), due to recent 
advances in human stem cell biology. Despite this progress, the hECTs generated 
to date remain immature relative to the native adult myocardium. In this review, 
we focus on the maturation challenge in the context of hECTs, the present state 
of the art, and future perspectives in terms of regenerative medicine, drug 
discovery, preclinical safety testing and pathophysiological studies.
