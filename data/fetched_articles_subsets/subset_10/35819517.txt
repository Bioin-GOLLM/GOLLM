The first section of the bone marrow workshop of the European Association of 
Haematopathology (EAHP) 2020 Virtual Meeting was dedicated to pediatric myeloid 
neoplasms. The section covered the whole spectrum of myeloid neoplasms, 
including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), 
myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), and acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML). The workshop cases are hereby presented, preceded by an 
introduction on these overall rare diseases in this age group. Very rare 
entities such as primary myelofibrosis, pediatric MDS with fibrosis, and MDS/MPN 
with JMML-like features and t(4;17)(q12;q21); FIP1L1::RARA fusion, are described 
in more detail.
