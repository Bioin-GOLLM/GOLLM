The type VII secretion system (T7SS) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis secretes 
three substrate classes: Esx, Esp, and PE/PPE proteins, that play important 
roles in bacterial physiology and host interaction. Five subtypes of T7SS, 
namely ESX-1 to ESX-5, are present in M. tb. ESX-4 is the progenitor of T7SS but 
its function is not understood. We investigated the ESX-4 system in 
Mycobacterium marinum. We show that ESX-4 of M. marinum does not secrete its 
cognate substrates, EsxT and EsxU, under the conditions tested. Paradoxically, 
the deletion of eccC4, an essential component of ESX-4, resulted in elevated 
secretion of protein substrates of ESX-1 and ESX-5. Consequently, the ΔeccC4 
mutant was more efficient in inducing actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, which 
led to enhanced phagocytosis by macrophages. Our results reveal an intimate 
crosstalk between the progenitor of T7SS and its more recent duplication and 
expansion, and provide new insight into the evolution of T7SS in mycobacteria.
