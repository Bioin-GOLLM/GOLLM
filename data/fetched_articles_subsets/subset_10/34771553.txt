Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are heterogeneous for their morphology, 
clinical characteristics, survival of patients, and evolution to acute myeloid 
leukemia. Different prognostic scoring systems including the International 
Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), the Revised IPSS, the WHO Typed Prognostic 
Scoring System, and the Lower-Risk Prognostic Scoring System have been 
introduced for categorizing the highly variable clinical outcomes. However, not 
considered by current MDS prognosis classification systems, gene variants have 
been identified for their contribution to the clinical heterogeneity of the 
disease and their impact on the prognosis. Notably, TP53 mutation is 
independently associated with a higher risk category, resistance to conventional 
therapies, rapid transformation to leukemia, and a poor outcome. Herein, we 
discuss the features of monoallelic and biallelic TP53 mutations within MDS, 
their corresponding carcinogenic mechanisms, their predictive value in current 
standard treatments including hypomethylating agents, allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation, and lenalidomide, together with the latest progress 
in TP53-targeted therapy strategies, especially MDS clinical trial data.
