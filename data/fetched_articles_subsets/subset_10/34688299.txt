BACKGROUND: Extremely rare progressive diseases like Sedaghatian-type 
Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia (SSMD) can be neonatally lethal and therefore go 
undiagnosed or are difficult to treat. Recent sequencing efforts have linked 
this disease to mutations in GPX4, with consequences in the resulting enzyme, 
glutathione peroxidase 4. This offers potential diagnostic and therapeutic 
avenues for those suffering from this disease, though the steps toward these 
treatments is often convoluted, expensive, and time-consuming.
MAIN BODY: The CureGPX4 organization was developed to promote awareness of 
GPX4-related diseases like SSMD, as well as support research that could lead to 
essential therapeutics for patients. We provide an overview of the 21 published 
SSMD cases and have compiled additional sequencing data for four previously 
unpublished individuals to illustrate the genetic component of SSMD, and the 
role of sequencing data in diagnosis. We outline in detail the steps CureGPX4 
has taken to reach milestones of team creation, disease understanding, drug 
repurposing, and design of future studies.
CONCLUSION: The primary aim of this review is to provide a roadmap for therapy 
development for rare, ultra-rare, and difficult to diagnose diseases, as well as 
increase awareness of the genetic component of SSMD. This work will offer a 
better understanding of GPx4-related diseases, and help guide researchers, 
clinicians, and patients interested in other rare diseases find a path towards 
treatments.
