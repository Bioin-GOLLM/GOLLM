Electroacupuncture (EA) is reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties and 
has beneficial effects on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, 
the underlying mechanisms of the effects of EA on ARDS remain unclear. This 
study aims to investigate the protective effect of EA on LPS-induced ARDS. In 
this study, Sprague-Dawley male rats were treated with EA at Hegu (LI4) for 45 
minutes before LPS instillation (0.4 mg/kg, 100 ul). H&E staining, wet-to-dry 
weight (W/D) ratio, PaO2, and protein content in BALF were employed to determine 
the function of lung tissues. Inflammatory cytokines in serum and BALF were 
detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay assay (ELISA). The levels of oxidative 
stress markers were detected to determine the oxidative stress status. Cell 
apoptosis was observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP 
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and western blot. Here, we found that EA 
pretreatment effectively alleviated lung pathological damage. Moreover, EA 
suppressed the oxidative stress damage by upregulating glutathione and 
superoxide dismutase and downregulating malondialdehyde. EA pretreatment also 
regulated apoptosis-related proteins, such as Bax and Bcl-2. We found that 
peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors γ (PPARγ) play a critical role 
during ARDS, EA up-regulated the expression of PPARγ, which inhibited the 
activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and decreased the inflammatory 
cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α). When 
rats were treated with GW9662, a selective PPARγ antagonist, these effects of EA 
were reversed. Our study demonstrated that EA pretreatment had a beneficial 
effect on LPS-induced ARDS in rats by anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and 
antiapoptotic properties which was regulated via PPARγ/NF-κB signaling pathway.
