PURPOSE: We evaluated urogenital anomalies in men with congenital absence of the 
vas deferens.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was done of 104 subfertile men 
with congenital absence of the vas deferens (84 bilaterally and 20 
unilaterally).
RESULTS: Of men with unilateral or bilateral congenital absence of the vas 
deferens 26 and 11%, respectively, had renal agenesis. Of men with unilateral 
congenital absence of the vas deferens and infertility 80% had genitourinary 
anamalies affecting the contralateral testis. No man with congenital absence of 
the vas deferens and renal anomalies had cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Other urogenital anomalies are common for men with congenital 
absence of the vas deferens. CFTR gene mutations frequently contribute to 
maldevelopment of the vas deferens but vasal agenesis can occur without any 
evidence of CFTR defects. CFTR abnormalities are rarely detected in men with 
congenital absence of the vas deferens and renal anomalies.
