Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a known cause of sudden cardiac death. The genetic 
basis of BrS is not well understood, and no one single gene is linked to even a 
majority of BrS cases. However, mutations in the gene SCN5A are the most common, 
although the high amount of phenotypic variability prevents a clear correlation 
between genotype and phenotype. Research techniques are limited, as most BrS 
cases still remain without a genetic diagnosis, thus impairing the 
implementation of experimental models representative of a general pathogenetic 
mechanism. In the present study, we report the largest family to-date with the 
segregation of the heterozygous variant NM_198056:c.4894C>T (p.Arg1632Cys) in 
the SCN5A gene. The genotype-phenotype relationship observed suggests a likely 
pathogenic effect of this variant. Functional studies to better understand the 
molecular effects of this variant are warranted.
