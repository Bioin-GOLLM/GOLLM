Protein-based biomaterials offer several advantages over synthetic materials, 
owing to their unique stimuli-responsive properties, biocompatibility and 
modular nature. Here, we demonstrate that E5C, a recombinant protein block 
polymer, consisting of five repeats of elastin like polypeptide (E) and a 
coiled-coil domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (C), is capable of 
forming a porous networked gel at physiological temperature, making it an 
excellent candidate for injectable biomaterials. Combination of E5C with 
Atsttrin, a chondroprotective engineered derivative of anti-inflammatory growth 
factor progranulin, provides a unique biochemical and biomechanical environment 
to protect against post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) onset and progression. 
E5C gel was demonstrated to provide prolonged release of Atsttrin and inhibit 
chondrocyte catabolism while facilitating anabolic signaling in vitro. We also 
provide in vivo evidence that prophylactic and therapeutic application of 
Atsttrin-loaded E5C gels protected against PTOA onset and progression in a 
rabbit anterior cruciate ligament transection model. Collectively, we have 
developed a unique protein-based gel capable of minimally invasive, sustained 
delivery of prospective therapeutics, particularly the progranulin-derivative 
Atsttrin, for therapeutic application in OA.
