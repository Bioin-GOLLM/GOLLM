Introduction In the present study, the combination of two tablets, one with 
Aspirin and Promethazine and the other with vitamin D3, C, and B3 along with 
zinc and selenium supplementation was proposed as an intervention (APMV2020). 
The ingredients in the formulation represent a precise, tailored therapy for the 
symptoms of COVID-19, combined with natural constituents to help the body itself 
build immunity to recover from infection. The present study was conducted to 
clinically validate the safety and efficacy of the APMV2020 tablets. Trial 
design The present trial is a randomized, multicentric, controlled clinical 
trial involving 260 mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. The treatment duration 
was of 10 days. Methodology The subjects were randomized to receive either the 
control intervention (clinical management protocol for COVID-19 advocated by the 
Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) or the test intervention (treatment 
with APMV2020 tablets along with the standard control treatment. The assessment 
days were baseline, days five and 10. Results APMV2020 significantly (<0.05) 
improved symptoms of COVID-19 like cough, myalgia, headache, and anosmia as 
compared to the control group. APMV2020 treatment also reduced inflammatory 
markers like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and C-reactive protein 
(CRP). Conclusion APMV2020 can prove as a good candidate to be integrated into 
the COVID-19 management protocol. As it can offer speedy clinical recovery to 
reduce the burden on healthcare infrastructure, second, the combination shows 
significant anti-inflammatory potential to improve prognosis, and lastly, the 
immunomodulatory properties offer long-term protection that can help in 
combating long COVID symptoms and complications.
