A 9-month-old male child, born of second-degree consanguinity, presented with a 
progressively enlarging head since early infancy. The child had normal early 
development, but further acquisition of milestones after 6 months was delayed. 
He had afebrile seizures at 9 months, followed by the appearance of appendicular 
spasticity. First magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed nonenhancing, diffuse, 
bilaterally symmetrical T1/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) 
hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity of the cerebral white matter and anterior 
temporal cysts. Subsequently, the periventricular and deep white matter 
developed microcystic changes with a pattern of radial stripes. Next-generation 
sequencing revealed homozygous autosomal recessive variations in the MLC1 gene 
[c.188T > G, (p.Leu63Arg)] on exon 3 and also in the EIF2B3 gene [c.674G > A, 
(p.Arg225Gln)] on exon 7, the parents being heterozygous carriers for both 
variations. This article highlights the rare occurrence of two leukodystrophies 
of diverse pathogenesis in a child from a nonpredisposed community.
