An NMR study of the cytochrome c variant Asn52Ile is used to show how the redox 
state change in native cytochrome c is coupled to a rearrangement of a proton 
network which runs through the cytochrome c molecule. The substitution breaks 
the H-bond network and removes the coupling. The uncovering of this putative 
proton channel and the connection of changes to it with redox state changes of 
the iron centre of the protein allows a possible description of the way in which 
redox energy state changes can be coupled to energization and gating of protons 
in membranes.
