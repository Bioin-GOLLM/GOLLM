Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most rare and lethal form of thyroid 
cancer and requires effective treatment. Efforts have been made to restore 
sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) expression in ATC cells where it has been 
downregulated, yet without complete success. Systems biology approaches have 
been used to simplify complex biological networks. Here, we attempt to find more 
suitable targets in order to restore NIS expression in ATC cells. We have built 
a simplified protein interaction network including transcription factors and 
proteins involved in MAPK, TGFÎ²/SMAD, PI3K/AKT, and TSHR signaling pathways 
which regulate NIS expression, alongside proteins interacting with them. The 
network was analyzed, and proteins were ranked based on several centrality 
indices. Our results suggest that the protein interaction network of NIS 
expression regulation is modular, and distance-based and information-flow-based 
centrality indices may be better predictors of important proteins in such 
networks. We propose that the high-ranked proteins found in our analysis are 
expected to be more promising targets in attempts to restore NIS expression in 
ATC cells.
