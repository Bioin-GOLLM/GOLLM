Two non-structural rotavirus proteins, NSP2 and NSP5, form viroplasm-like 
structures in vivo.

In rotavirus-infected cells, the non-structural proteins NSP5 and NSP2 localize 
in complexes called viroplasms, where replication and assembly occur. Recently, 
we have demonstrated direct interaction of NSP5 with NSP2, and as a consequence 
of that, up-regulation of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. To investigate a possible 
structural role for the NSP2-NSP5 interaction, we analysed the cytoplasmic 
distribution of the two proteins in transfected cells by immunofluorescence 
using specific antibodies. Here we report that NSP2 and NSP5 can drive the 
formation of viroplasm-like structures (VLS) in the absence of other rotaviral 
proteins and rotavirus replication. Several NSP5 deletion mutants were 
constructed and expressed in combination with NSP2. Both the N- and C-terminal 
domains of NSP5 were found to be essential for VLS formation. Only one mutant, 
with an internal deletion of residues 81-130, was able to interact with NSP2 to 
form VLS. Analysis of the phosphorylation capacity of the different mutants in 
vivo indicated that hyperphosphorylation of NSP5 is necessary, but not 
sufficient, for VLS formation. Our results suggest a role for the non-structural 
protein NSP5 in the structure of viroplasms mediated by its interaction with 
NSP2.
