BACKGROUND: ß-thalassemia is one of the most common inherited blood disorders in 
the world and a major deterrent to the public health of Bangladesh. The 
management of thalassemia patients requires lifelong frequent blood transfusion 
and the available treatment options are unsatisfactory. A national policy on 
thalassemia prevention is mandatory in Bangladesh. However, precise and 
up-to-date information on the frequency of ß-thalassemia carriers are missing 
due to lack of accurate diagnostic approaches, limited access to information and 
absence of national screening program. This study aims to determine the 
nationwide carrier frequency of hemoglobin E (HbE) and β- thalassemia and 
mutation spectrum among the carriers using molecular, hematological and 
biochemical methods.
METHODS: The study enrolled a total of 1877 individuals (60.1% male and 39.9% 
female) aged between 18 and 35 years. Total sample size and its division-wise 
breakdown were calculated in proportion to national and division-wise 
population. Venous blood was collected and subjected to CBC analysis and 
Hb-electrophoresis for each participant. Serum ferritin was measured to detect 
coexistence of iron deficiency anemia with thalassemia carrier. DNA-based High 
Resolution Melting (HRM) curve analysis was performed for confirmation of 
carrier status by mutation detection.
RESULTS: Of 11.89% (95% CI, 10.43-13.35) carriers of β-globin gene mutations, 
8.68% (95% CI, 7.41-9.95) had HbE trait (ETT) and 2.24% (95% CI, 1.57-2.91) had 
beta-thalassemia trait (BTT). Among eight divisions, Rangpur had the highest 
carrier frequency of 27.1% (ETT-25%, BTT-2.1%), whereas Khulna had the lowest 
frequency of 4.2% (ETT-4.2% only). Moreover, α- thalassemia, HbD trait, HbE 
disease, hereditary persistence of HbF were detected in 0.11, 0.16, 0.43 and 
0.16% participants, respectively. HRM could identify two individuals with 
reported pathogenic mutations in both alleles who were erroneously interpreted 
as carriers by hematological indices. Finally, a total of nine different 
mutations including a novel mutation (c.151A > G) were detected in the β-globin 
gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Since carrier frequency for both HbE and β-thalassemia is 
alarmingly high in Bangladesh, a nationwide awareness and prevention program 
should be made mandatory to halt the current deteriorating situations. 
Mutation-based confirmation is highly recommended for the inconclusive cases 
with conventional carrier screening methods to avoid any faulty detection of 
thalassemia carriers.
