BACKGROUND: Chromosome 12q24 was recently associated with hypertension. 
Proteasome Modulator 9 (PSMD9) lies in the 12q24 locus and is in linkage with 
MODY3, type 2 diabetes (T2D), microvascular and macrovascular pathology, carpal 
tunnel syndrome, and hypercholesterolemia in Italian families.
AIMS: Our goal was to determine whether PSMD9 is linked to elevated blood 
pressure/hypertension in T2D families.
METHODS: We characterized the Italian T2D families' members for presence and/or 
absence of elevated blood pressure (â‰¥ 130/80) and/or hypertension. The 
phenotypes were described as unknown in all cases in which the diagnosis was 
either unclear or the data were not available for the subject studied. We tested 
in the 200 Italians families for the presence of the linkage of the PSMD9 T2D 
risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) IVS3+nt460 A > G, IVS3+nt437 T > C 
and E197G A > G with elevated blood pressure/hypertension. The non-parametric 
linkage analysis was performed for this qualitative phenotype by using the 
Merlin software; the Lod score and correspondent P-value were calculated. 
Parametric linkage analysis was also performed. For the significant linkage 
score, 1000 replicates were run to calculate the empirical P-value.
RESULTS: The PSMD9 gene SNPs studied are in linkage with elevated blood 
pressure/hypertension in our Italian families.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the PSMD9 gene and/or any variant in linkage 
disequilibrium with the SNPs studied contribute to the linkage to hypertension 
within our family dataset. This is the first report of PSMD9 linkage to 
hypertension within the 12q24 locus.
