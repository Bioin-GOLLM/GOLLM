Homologous recombination serves multiple roles in DNA repair that are essential 
for maintaining genomic stability. We here describe RI-1, a small molecule that 
inhibits the central recombination protein RAD51. RI-1 specifically reduces gene 
conversion in human cells while stimulating single strand annealing. RI-1 binds 
covalently to the surface of RAD51 protein at cysteine 319 that likely 
destabilizes an interface used by RAD51 monomers to oligomerize into filaments 
on DNA. Correspondingly, the molecule inhibits the formation of subnuclear RAD51 
foci in cells following DNA damage, while leaving replication protein A focus 
formation unaffected. Finally, it potentiates the lethal effects of a DNA 
cross-linking drug in human cells. Given that this inhibitory activity is seen 
in multiple human tumor cell lines, RI-1 holds promise as an oncologic drug. 
Furthermore, RI-1 represents a unique tool to dissect the network of reaction 
pathways that contribute to DNA repair in cells.
