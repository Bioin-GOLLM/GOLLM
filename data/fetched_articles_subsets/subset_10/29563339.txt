BACKGROUND: HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) 
syndrome is a severe variant of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy affecting 
approximately 1% of all pregnancies, and has significant maternal and fetal 
morbidity. Previously, we showed that upregulation of the alternative pathway of 
complement (APC) plays a role in HELLP syndrome. We hypothesize that HELLP 
syndrome follows a 2-hit disease model similar to atypical hemolytic uremic 
syndrome (aHUS), requiring both genetic susceptibility and an environmental risk 
factor. Our objective was to perform a comparative analysis of the frequency of 
APC activation and germline mutations in affected women and to create a 
predictive model for identifying HELLP syndrome.
METHODS: Pregnant women with HELLP syndrome, and healthy controls after 23 weeks 
of gestation were recruited, along with aHUS and thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura participants. We performed a functional assay, the mHam, and targeted 
genetic sequencing in all groups.
RESULTS: Significantly more participants with rare germline mutations in APC 
genes were present in the HELLP cohort compared with controls (46% versus 8%, P 
= 0.01). In addition, significantly more HELLP participants were positive for 
the mHam when compared with controls (62% versus 16%, P = 0.009). Testing 
positive for both a germline mutation and the mHam was highly predictive for the 
diagnosis of HELLP syndrome.
CONCLUSION: HELLP syndrome is characterized by both activation of the APC and 
frequent germline mutations in APC genes. Similar to aHUS, treatment via 
complement inhibition to mitigate maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality may 
be possible.
