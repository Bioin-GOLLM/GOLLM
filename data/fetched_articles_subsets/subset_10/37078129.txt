Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are common driver genes in 
nonsmall-cell lung cancer and have different sensitivities to EGFR-tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). EGFR is divided into classic mutations and rare 
mutations. Classic mutations are well known, but the understanding of rare 
mutations is not sufficient. In this article, we summarize the clinical research 
and treatment progress of rare mutations for different EGFR-TKIs and provide a 
basis for clinical treatment decisions.
