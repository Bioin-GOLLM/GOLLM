Recessively-inherited NR2E3 gene mutations cause an unusual retinopathy with 
abnormally-increased short-wavelength sensitive cone (S-cone) function, in 
addition to reduced rod and long/middle-wavelength sensitive cone (L/M-cone) 
function. Progress toward clinical trials to treat patients with this otherwise 
incurable retinal degeneration prompted the need to determine efficacy outcome 
measures. Comparisons were made between three computerized perimeters available 
in the clinic. These perimeters could deliver short-wavelength stimuli on 
longer-wavelength adapting backgrounds to measure whether S-cone vision can be 
quantified. Results from a cohort of normal subjects were compared across the 
three perimeters to determine S-cone isolation and test-retest variability. 
S-cone perimetry data from NR2E3-ESCS (enhanced S-cone syndrome) patients were 
examined and determined to have five stages of disease severity. Using these 
stages, strategies were proposed for monitoring efficacy of either a focal or 
retina-wide intervention. This work sets the stage for clinical trials.
