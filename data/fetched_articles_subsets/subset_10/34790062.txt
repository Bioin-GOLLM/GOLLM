Background: There are no uniform guidelines on low-dose computed tomography 
(LDCT) follow-up in lung cancer screening. Few studies have analyzed the 
incidental abnormalities and role of tumor markers in lung cancer screening. The 
purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of LDCT, 
optimal follow-up duration, incidental findings, and role of tumor markers in 
diagnosing lung cancer. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed subjects who 
underwent their first LDCT in Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital between September 1, 2015, 
and August 31, 2016. All chest CT scans until August 31, 2020, were recorded. A 
non-calcified nodule with a diameter ≥2 mm on LDCT was defined as a positive 
result. We extracted the data, including possible risk factors of lung cancer 
and follow-up outcomes. Results: A total of 1502 subjects were recruited. Of the 
38 subjects who underwent biopsy, 31 had confirmed lung cancer. Lung cancer in 
all patients was diagnosed within 4 years. Univariate logistic regression 
analysis revealed that a family history of lung cancer in first-degree relatives 
and abnormal serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were the significant 
risk factors for lung cancer. A cumulative lung cancer incidence of 54.7 
patients per 1000 person-years was determined solely via radiological follow-up. 
In total, 271 (18%) subjects exhibited incidental findings on baseline LDCT. 
Conclusion: The overall lung cancer detection rate in this study was 2.1% in the 
5-year study period. A family history of lung cancer and abnormal serum CEA 
levels are important risk factors for lung cancer. A minimum of 4-year follow-up 
is required to track suspicious nodules. A purely radiological follow-up detects 
a high incidence of lung cancer.
