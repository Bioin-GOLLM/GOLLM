A biomarker is a physiological observable marker that acts as a stand-in and, in 
the best-case scenario, forecasts a clinically significant outcome. Diagnostic 
biomarkers are more convenient and cost-effective than directly measuring the 
ultimate clinical outcome. Cancer is among the most prominent global health 
problems and a major cause of morbidity and death globally. Therefore, cancer 
biomarker assays that are trustworthy, consistent, precise, and verified are 
desperately needed. Biomarker-based tumor detection holds a lot of promise for 
improving disease knowledge at the molecular scale and early detection and 
surveillance. In contrast to conventional approaches, surface plasmon resonance 
(SPR) allows for the quick and less invasive screening of a variety of 
circulating indicators, such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNA (miRNA), 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs), lipids, and proteins. With several advantages, 
the SPR technique is a particularly beneficial choice for the point-of-care 
identification of biomarkers. As a result, it enables the timely detection of 
tumor markers, which could be used to track cancer development and suppress the 
relapse of malignant tumors. This review emphasizes advancements in SPR 
biosensing technologies for cancer detection.
