Asparaginase, which depletes asparagine and glutamine, activates amino-acid 
stress response. Oxidative stress mediated by excessive reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) causes enhanced mitochondrial permeabilization and subsequent cell 
apoptosis and is considered as a plausible mechanism for drug-induced 
hepatotoxicity, a common toxicity of asparaginase in adults with acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Studies investigating the pharmacogenetics of 
asparaginase in ALL are limited and focused on asparaginase-induced allergic 
reaction common in pediatric patients. Here, we sought to determine a potential 
association between the variant rs4880 in SOD2 gene, a key mitochondrial enzyme 
that protects cells against ROS, and hepatotoxicity during asparaginase-based 
therapy in 224 patients enrolled on CALGB-10102, a treatment trial for adults 
with ALL. We report that the CC genotype of rs4880 is associated with increased 
hepatotoxicity following asparaginase-based treatment. Thus, rs4880 likely 
contributes to asparaginase-induced hepatotoxicity, and functional studies 
investigating this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) are needed to develop 
therapeutic approaches that mitigate this toxicity.
