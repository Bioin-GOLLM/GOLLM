parathyroid carcinoma: first case report and a review of the literature.

Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism amongst 
children, with only nine previously reported cases. The objective of the study 
was to present the first pediatric case with a germline CDC73 (formerly known as 
HRPT2) mutation, and to review the literature. A 14-year-old girl presented with 
pathologic slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). The patient was noted to 
have an elevated calcium level of 3.4 mmol/L (13.4 mg/dL), a parathyroid hormone 
(PTH) level of 1013 ng/L (1013 pg/mL), and a 3-cm palpable neck mass. Ultrasound 
and 99mTc-Sestamibi confirmed the suspicion of a parathyroid mass. 
Intraoperative findings and pathology confirmed the diagnosis of parathyroid 
carcinoma. Post-operative PTH decreased to 14 ng/L (14 pg/mL). Genetic testing 
showed a germline 70 G>T HRPT2/CDC73 mutation. This is the first case 
documenting a germline 70 G>T HRPT2/CDC73 gene mutation in a pediatric 
parathyroid carcinoma. Patients with sporadic parathyroid carcinoma may benefit 
from HRPT2/CDC73 gene mutation screening.
