OBJECTIVE: Multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable with high rates of relapse. 
New therapeutic drugs are therefore urgently needed to improve the prognosis. 
JaponiconeA (JA), a natural product isolated from Inula japonica Thunb, has 
shown good anti-MM potential. A comprehensive study should therefore be 
conducted to identify both the in vitro and in vivo mechanisms of the anti-MM 
effects of JA.
METHODS: CCK8 assays and flow cytometry were used to detect the proliferation, 
apoptosis, and cell cycle of MM cell lines when treated with JA. In vivo 
experiments were conducted using subcutaneous xenograft mouse models. We also 
identified possible targets and the mechanism of JA using RNA-seq and c-Map 
databases, and identified the specific targets of JA in bortezomib-sensitive and 
-resistant MM cell lines using CETSA, DARTS, and rescue experiments. 
Furthermore, JA and bortezomib were used separately or together to characterize 
their possible synergistic effects.
RESULTS: In vitro, JA inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis and G2/M 
phase arrest in MM cell lines, and selectively killed primary CD138+ MM cells. 
In vivo, JA also demonstrated a strong anti-tumor effect with no observable 
toxicity. In addition, JA showed synergetic effects in combination with 
bortezomib, and enhanced the anti-tumor effect of bortezomib in 
bortezomib-resistant cells. CETSA and DARTS confirmed direct binding of JA to 
NF-κB inhibitor kinase beta (IKKβ), and overexpression of IKKβ or knockdown of 
IκBα partially rescued the apoptosis induced by JA.
CONCLUSIONS: JA exhibited strong anti-tumor effects in MM. It sensitized myeloma 
cells to bortezomib and overcame NF-κB-induced drug resistance by inhibiting 
IKKβ, providing a new treatment strategy for MM patients.
