The main malignant tumor of the bone tissue is represented by osteosarcoma, 
neoplasia with a reserved prognosis and an unpredictable evolution, often 
aggressive. Cell cycle disruption is one of the complex biomolecular mechanisms 
involved in the progression of osteosarcomas. In this study, we analyzed the 
immunoexpression of Ki67, p53 and cyclin D1 for 18 primitive osteosarcomas in 
relation to the clinicopathological prognosis parameters of the lesions. The 
results indicated the predominance of lesions in male young patients, with 
femoral location, most tumors being represented by the osteoblastic type, with 
high grade, size <8 cm and in advanced stages. Reactions were present in all 
cases, the high immunoexpression being associated with osteoblastic∕epithelioid 
types (Ki67, cyclin D1, p53), high grade (Ki67, cyclin D1) and advanced stage 
(Ki67, cyclin D1). The study revealed a positive linear relation of the 
investigated immunomarkers expression, which indicates their usefulness in 
identifying lesions with aggressive progression potential.
