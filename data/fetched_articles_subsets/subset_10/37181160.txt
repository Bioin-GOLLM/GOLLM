Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary syndrome caused by heterozygous 
mutations in the NOTCH3 gene that manifests in adulthood and is characterized by 
recurrent transient ischemic attacks and strokes, migraine-like headaches, 
psychiatric disturbance, and progressive dementia. The current study reports an 
interesting case of CADASIL in a Saudi patient with a heterozygous mutation in 
exon 18 of the NOTCH3 gene presenting only with cognitive decline without 
migraine or stroke. The diagnosis was suspected mainly because of the typical 
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features that led to performing genetic 
testing to confirm the diagnosis. This illustrates the importance of brain MRI 
in the diagnosis of CADASIL. Increased awareness of neurologists and 
neuroradiologists about the typical MRI features of CADASIL is of paramount 
importance to reach the diagnosis in a timely manner. Awareness of the atypical 
presentations of CADASIL will lead to identifying more CADASIL cases.
