Nitropyrene (1-NP) is a specific indicator of exposure to diesel exhaust and is 
partly metabolized to 1-aminopyrene (1-AP) and N-acetyl-1-aminopyrene (1-NAAP), 
which are excreted in urine. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of 
gene polymorphisms of metabolic enzymes for 1-NP on the urinary concentrations 
of 1-AP and 1-NAAP. The study participants were 70 South Koreans who were 
occupationally or environmentally exposed to diesel exhaust. To evaluate 1-NP 
exposure levels, we sampled airborne particulate matters with a personal air 
sampler and measured urinary 1-AP and 1-NAAP concentrations. The genetic 
polymorphisms of the 1-NP metabolic enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, EPHX1, NQO1, and 
NAT2) were determined by direct sequencing. The mean 1-NP exposure level was 
20.40 pg/m3, and the mean urinary concentrations of 1-AP and 1-NAAP were 0.074 
nM and 0.213 nM, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the 1-NP 
exposure level and urinary 1-AP concentrations was 0.0138 and that between the 
1-NP exposure level and urinary 1-NAAP concentrations was 0.1493, and neither 
correlation coefficient was statistically significant. The correlation 
coefficient between the 1-NP exposure level and urinary 1-AP concentrations 
showed statistically significant differences according to the CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 
genotypes, and that between the 1-NP exposure level and urinary 1-NAAP 
concentrations was significantly different according to the CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and 
NAT2 genotypes. The urinary concentration of 1-NAAP is a better biomarker for 
exposure to 1-NP or DEPs because the former is higher, easier to measure, and 
more strongly correlated with 1-NP exposure levels than that of 1-AP. The 
relationship between 1-NP exposure and urinary 1-AP or 1-NAAP concentration 
depends on the single nucleotide polymorphism types of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, NQO1, and 
NAT2.
