The high background tumor mutation burden in cutaneous melanoma limits the 
ability to identify significantly mutated genes (SMGs) that drive this cancer. 
To address this, we performed a mutation significance study of over 1,000 
melanoma exomes, combined with a multi-omic analysis of 470 cases from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas. We discovered several SMGs with co-occurring 
loss-of-heterozygosity and loss-of-function mutations, including PBRM1, PLXNC1 
and PRKAR1A, which encodes a protein kinase A holoenzyme subunit. Deconvolution 
of bulk tumor transcriptomes into cancer, immune and stromal components revealed 
a melanoma-intrinsic oxidative phosphorylation signature associated with protein 
kinase A pathway alterations. We also identified SMGs on the X chromosome, 
including the RNA helicase DDX3X, whose loss-of-function mutations were 
exclusively observed in males. Finally, we found that tumor mutation burden and 
immune infiltration contain complementary information on survival of patients 
with melanoma. In summary, our multi-omic analysis provides insights into 
melanoma etiology and supports contribution of specific mutations to the sex 
bias observed in this cancer.
