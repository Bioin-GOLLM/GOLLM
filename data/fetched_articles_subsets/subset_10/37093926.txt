This review explores the factors that improve meat protein digestibility and 
applies the findings to the development of home meal replacements with improved 
protein digestion rates in older adults. Various methods improve the digestion 
rate of proteins, such as heat, ultrasound, high pressure, or pulse electric 
field. In addition, probiotics aid in protein digestion by improving the 
function of digestive organs and secreting enzymes. Plant-derived proteases, 
such as papain, bromelain, ficin, actinidin, or zingibain, can also improve the 
protein digestion rate; however, the digestion rate is dependent on the plant 
enzyme used and protein characteristics. Sous vide processing improves the rate 
and extent of protein digestibility, but the protein digestion rate decreases 
with increasing temperature and heating time. Ultrasound, high pressure, or 
pulsed electric field treatments degrade the protein structure and increase the 
proteolytic enzyme contact area to improve the protein digestion rate.
