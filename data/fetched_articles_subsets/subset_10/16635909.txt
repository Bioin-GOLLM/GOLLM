OBJECTIVE: The nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is one of the pivotal regulators of 
autoimmunity and inflammation, which has been shown to be activated in the 
inflamed mucosa of patients with celiac disease (CD). Recently, in the NFKB1 
gene promoter region, a common insertion/deletion (-94ins/delATTG) polymorphism 
located between two putative key promoter regulatory elements was described. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the -94ins/delATTG 
NFKB1 gene promoter functional variant to CD genetic predisposition.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case-control cohort comprising 478 patients with CD and 
711 healthy controls as well as a panel of 196 celiac families was genotyped for 
the 94ins/delATTG NFKB1 polymorphism, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
method combined with fluorescence technology.
RESULTS: We found no statistically significant differences between CD patients 
and controls when the -94ins/delATTG genotype and allele distributions were 
compared. Accordingly, the familial analysis did not reach statistically 
significant deviation in the transmission of -94ins/delATTG alleles to the 
affected offspring.
CONCLUSIONS: From these results, it could be suggested that the -94ins/delATTG 
NFKB1 polymorphism does not play a major role in CD susceptibility.
