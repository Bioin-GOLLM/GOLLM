Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) composed of a mixture of 
short-chain-length-medium-chain-length (SCL-MCL) hydroxyacyl monomers are 
biologically produced polyesters that have properties ranging from thermoplastic 
to elastomeric, dependent on the molar ratio of SCL to MCL monomers incorporated 
into the copolymer. Because of the potential wide range of properties and 
applications for SCL-MCL PHA copolymers, it is important to develop and 
characterize novel metabolic pathways for SCL-MCL PHA production. The current 
study shows that coexpression of fabG genes from either E. coli or Pseudomonas 
sp. 61-3 with fabH(F87T) and PHA synthase genes enhances the production of 
SCL-MCL PHA copolymer from both related and nonrelated carbon sources in 
Escherichia coli LS5218, indicating the flexibility of FabG as a 
monomer-supplying enzyme for biological PHA production.
