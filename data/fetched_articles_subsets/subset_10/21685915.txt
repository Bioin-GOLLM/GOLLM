Hereditary pheochromocytoma (PCC) is often caused by germline mutations in one 
of nine susceptibility genes described to date, but there are familial cases 
without mutations in these known genes. We sequenced the exomes of three 
unrelated individuals with hereditary PCC (cases) and identified mutations in 
MAX, the MYC associated factor X gene. Absence of MAX protein in the tumors and 
loss of heterozygosity caused by uniparental disomy supported the involvement of 
MAX alterations in the disease. A follow-up study of a selected series of 59 
cases with PCC identified five additional MAX mutations and suggested an 
association with malignant outcome and preferential paternal transmission of MAX 
mutations. The involvement of the MYC-MAX-MXD1 network in the development and 
progression of neural crest cell tumors is further supported by the lack of 
functional MAX in rat PCC (PC12) cells and by the amplification of MYCN in 
neuroblastoma and suggests that loss of MAX function is correlated with 
metastatic potential.
