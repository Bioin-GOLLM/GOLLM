Deadenylases are best known for degrading the poly(A) tail during mRNA decay. 
The deadenylase family has expanded throughout evolution and, in mammals, 
consists of 12 Mg2+-dependent 3'-end RNases with substrate specificity that is 
mostly unknown. Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 7 (PCH7) is a unique recessive 
syndrome characterized by neurodegeneration and ambiguous genitalia. We studied 
12 human families with PCH7, uncovering biallelic, loss-of-function mutations in 
TOE1, which encodes an unconventional deadenylase. toe1-morphant zebrafish 
displayed midbrain and hindbrain degeneration, modeling PCH-like structural 
defects in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that TOE1 associated with small nuclear 
RNAs (snRNAs) incompletely processed spliceosomal. These pre-snRNAs contained 3' 
genome-encoded tails often followed by post-transcriptionally added adenosines. 
Human cells with reduced levels of TOE1 accumulated 3'-end-extended pre-snRNAs, 
and the immunoisolated TOE1 complex was sufficient for 3'-end maturation of 
snRNAs. Our findings identify the cause of a neurodegenerative syndrome linked 
to snRNA maturation and uncover a key factor involved in the processing of snRNA 
3' ends.
