BACKGROUND: FtsZ, the major cytoskeletal protein in bacterial cytokinesis, 
assembles in vitro into protofilaments, which can further associate into sheets, 
bundles or tubes. We have constructed 16 site-directed mutants of E. coli ftsZ, 
and tested them for GTP hydrolysis and assembly in vitro, and for their ability 
to complement the temperature sensitive ftsZ84 mutation in E. coli.
RESULTS: The mutants were grouped into three classes. Benign mutants, which 
mapped mostly to the front and back surface of the protofilament, were able to 
complement ftsZ84 in vivo and showed normal assembly in vitro. GTP contact 
mutations had less than 10% of wild type GTPase activity. They could all 
assemble in vitro, and several of these mutants could complement ftsZ84. A 
third, and newly discovered, class of mutations mapped to the sides of the 
protofilaments. These lateral mutants had mostly normal GTPase and assembly in 
vitro, but none of them complemented ftsZ84. The non-complementing mutants 
showed greatly reduced expression from the pBS58 vector, suggesting possible 
dominant negative effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Several mutants with greatly reduced GTPase could still complement 
ftsZ84, suggesting that the high level of GTPase observed in vitro is not 
essential for in vivo function. All of the lateral mutants failed to complement 
ftsZ84, which suggests that these surfaces of the protofilaments are important 
for function in cell division. These lateral surfaces may mediate association of 
FtsZ protofilaments into pairs or small sheets, although their structure is 
apparently different from the sheets assembled in DEAE dextran or calcium.
