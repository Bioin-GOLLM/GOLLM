Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes TLR2-4 
and TLR7-9, but not in TLR1 and TLR6, have been previously evaluated regarding 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition and disease progression in 
various populations, most of which were European. In this study, we examined 
associations between a total of 41 SNPs in 8 TLR genes (TLR1-4, TLR6-9) and HIV 
status in North American subjects (total n=276 (Caucasian, n=102; African 
American, n=150; other, n=24)). Stratification of the data by self-identified 
race revealed that a total of nine SNPs in TLR1, TLR4, TLR6 and TLR8 in 
Caucasians, and two other SNPs, one each in TLR4 and TLR8, in African Americans 
were significantly associated with HIV status at P<0.05. Concordant with the 
odds ratios of these SNPs, significant differences were observed in the SNP 
allele frequencies between HIV+ and HIV- subjects. Finally, in Caucasians, 
certain haplotypes of single (TLR1 and TLR4) and heterodimer (TLR2_TLR6) genes 
may be inferred as 'susceptible' or 'protective'. Our study provides in-depth 
insight into the associations between TLR variants, particularly TLR1 and TLR6, 
and HIV status in North Americans, and suggests that these associations may be 
race specific.
