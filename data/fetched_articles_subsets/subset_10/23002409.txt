OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review how personality characteristics contribute to the 
onset, maintenance or modulation of fibromyalgia.
METHOD: The databases Medline and PsychINFO were examined from 1967 to 2012 to 
identify studies that investigated associations between fibromyalgia and 
personality. Search terms included fibromyalgia and personality, trait 
psychology, characteristics and individual differences.
RESULTS: Numerous studies indicate that patients with fibromyalgia experience 
psychological distress. Various instruments have been used to evaluate distress 
and related psychological domains, such as anxiety or depression, in 
fibromyalgia. In many cases, these same instruments have been used to study 
personality characteristics in fibromyalgia with a subsequent blurring of cause 
and effect between personality and psychological distress. In addition, the 
symptoms of fibromyalgia may change pre-illness personality characteristics 
themselves. These issues make it difficult to identify specific personality 
characteristics that might influence the fibromyalgia process. Despite this 
inherent problem with the methodologies used in the studies that make up this 
literature review, or perhaps because of it, we found no defined personality 
profile specific to fibromyalgia. However, many patients with fibromyalgia do 
show personality characteristics that facilitate psychological responses to 
stressful situations, such as catastrophising or poor coping techniques, and 
these in turn associate with mechanisms contributing to fibromyalgia.
CONCLUSION: No specific fibromyalgia personality is defined but it is proposed 
that personality is an important filter that modulates a person's response to 
psychological stressors. Certain personalities may facilitate translation of 
these stressors to physiological responses driving the fibromyalgia mechanism.
