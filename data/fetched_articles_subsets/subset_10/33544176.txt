Sex estimation from skeletal remains is crucial for the estimation of the 
biological profile of an individual. Although the most commonly used bones for 
means of sex estimation are the pelvis and the skull, research has shown that 
acceptable accuracy rates might be achieved by using other skeletal elements 
such as vertebrae. This study aims to contribute to the development of sex 
estimation standards from a Turkish population through the examination of CT 
scans from the seven cervical vertebrae. A total of 294 individuals were 
included in this study. The CT scans were obtained from patients attending the 
Bakirkoy Training and Research Hospital (Turkey) and the data was collected 
retrospectively by virtually taking measurements from each cervical vertebrae. 
The full database was divided into a training set (N = 210) and a validation set 
(N = 84) to test the fit of the models. Observer error was assessed through 
technical error of measurement and sex differences were explored using 
parametric and non-parametric approaches. Logistic regression was applied in 
order to explore different combinations of vertebral parameters. The results 
showed low intra- and inter-observer errors. All parameters presented 
statistically significant differences between the sexes and a total of 15 
univariate and multivariate models were generated producing accuracies ranging 
from a minimum of 83.30% to a maximum of 91.40% for a model including three 
parameters collected from four vertebrae. This study presents a virtual method 
using cervical vertebrae for sex estimation on the Turkish population providing 
error rates comparable to other metric studies conducted on the postcranial 
skeleton. The presented results contribute not only to the development of 
population-specific standards but also to the generation of virtual methods that 
can be tested, validated, and further examined in future forensic cases.
