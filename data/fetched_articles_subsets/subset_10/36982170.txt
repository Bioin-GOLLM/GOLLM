Peritoneal implantation and lymph node metastasis have different driving 
mechanisms in ovarian cancer. Elucidating the underlying mechanism of lymph node 
metastasis is important for treatment outcomes. A new cell line, FDOVL, was 
established from a metastatic lymph node of a patient with primary 
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and was then characterized. The effect of 
NOTCH1-p.C702fs mutation and NOTCH1 inhibitor on migration was evaluated in 
vitro and in vivo. Ten paired primary sites and metastatic lymph nodes were 
analyzed by RNA sequencing. The FDOVL cell line with serious karyotype 
abnormalities could be stably passaged and could be used to generated 
xenografts. NOTCH1-p.C702fs mutation was found exclusively in the FDOVL cell 
line and the metastatic lymph node. The mutation promoted migration and invasion 
in cell and animal models, and these effects were markedly repressed by the 
NOTCH inhibitor LY3039478. RNA sequencing confirmed CSF3 as the downstream 
effector of NOTCH1 mutation. Furthermore, the mutation was significantly more 
common in metastatic lymph nodes than in other peritoneal metastases in 10 
paired samples (60% vs. 20%). The study revealed that NOTCH1 mutation is 
probably a driver of lymph node metastasis in ovarian cancer, which offers new 
ideas for the treatment of ovarian cancer lymph node metastasis with NOTCH 
inhibitors.
