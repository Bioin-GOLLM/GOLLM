Cell division is fundamental to all organisms and the green alga used here 
exhibits both key animal and plant functions. Specifically, we analyzed the 
molecular and cellular dynamics of early embryonic divisions of the 
multicellular green alga Volvox carteri (Chlamydomonadales). Relevant proteins 
related to mitosis and cytokinesis were identified in silico, the corresponding 
genes were cloned, fused to yfp, and stably expressed in Volvox, and the tagged 
proteins were studied by live-cell imaging. We reveal rearrangements of the 
microtubule cytoskeleton during centrosome separation, spindle formation, 
establishment of the phycoplast, and generation of previously unknown 
structures. The centrosomes participate in initiation of spindle formation and 
determination of spindle orientation. Although the nuclear envelope does not 
break down during early mitosis, intermixing of cytoplasm and nucleoplasm 
results in loss of nuclear identity. Finally, we present a model for mitosis in 
Volvox. Our study reveals enormous dynamics, clarifies spatio-temporal 
relationships of subcellular structures, and provides insight into the evolution 
of cell division.
