The insect baculovirus AcMNPV (Autographa californica multiple nuclear 
polyhedrosis virus) enters many mammalian cell lines, prompting its application 
as a general eukaryotic gene delivery agent, but the basis of entry is poorly 
understood. For adherent mammalian cells, we show that entry is favoured by low 
pH and by increasing the available cell-surface area through a transient release 
from the substratum. Low pH also stimulated baculovirus entry into mammalian 
cells grown in suspension which, optimally, could reach 90% of the transduced 
population. The basic loop, residues 268-281, of the viral surface glycoprotein 
gp64 was required for entry and a tetra mutant with increasing basicity 
increased entry into a range of mammalian cells. The same mutant failed to 
plaque in Sf9 cells, instead showing individual cell entry and minimal 
cell-to-cell spread, consistent with an altered fusion phenotype. Viruses grown 
in different insect cells showed different mammalian cell entry efficiencies, 
suggesting that additional factors also govern entry.
