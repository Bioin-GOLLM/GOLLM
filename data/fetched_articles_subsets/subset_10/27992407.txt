Signalling and post-transcriptional gene control are both critical for the 
regulation of pluripotency, yet how they are integrated to influence cell 
identity remains poorly understood. LIN28 (also known as LIN28A), a highly 
conserved RNA-binding protein, has emerged as a central post-transcriptional 
regulator of cell fate through blockade of let-7 microRNA biogenesis and direct 
modulation of mRNA translation. Here we show that LIN28 is phosphorylated by 
MAPK/ERK in pluripotent stem cells, which increases its levels via 
post-translational stabilization. LIN28 phosphorylation had little impact on 
let-7 but enhanced the effect of LIN28 on its direct mRNA targets, revealing a 
mechanism that uncouples LIN28's let-7-dependent and -independent activities. We 
have linked this mechanism to the induction of pluripotency by somatic cell 
reprogramming and the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. 
Collectively, our findings indicate that MAPK/ERK directly impacts LIN28, 
defining an axis that connects signalling, post-transcriptional gene control, 
and cell fate regulation.
