BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune intestinal disorder caused by 
gluten protein consumption in genetically predisposed individuals. As biopsy 
sampling is an invasive procedure, finding novel noninvasive serological markers 
for screening of at-risk CeD population is a priority. Metabolomics is helpful 
in monitoring metabolite changes in body fluids and tissues. In the present 
study, we evaluated serum metabolite levels of CeD patients relative to healthy 
controls with the aim of introducing new biomarkers for population screening.
METHOD: We compared the serum metabolic profile of CeD patients (n = 42) and 
healthy controls (n = 22) using NMR spectroscopy and multivariate analysis.
RESULT: 25 metabolites were identified by serum metabolic profiling. Levels of 
3-hydroxyisobutyric acid and isobutyrate showed significant differences in CeD 
patients' samples compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05). According to 
pathway analysis, our data demonstrated that changes in nine metabolic pathways 
were significantly disrupted/affected in patients with CeD. These enriched 
pathways are involved in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis; primary bile acid 
biosynthesis; nitrogen metabolism; glutamine and glutamate metabolism; valine, 
leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis and degradation; taurine and hypotaurine 
metabolism; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; glycine, serine, and 
threonine metabolism; and arginine biosynthesis.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our results demonstrated that changes in the serum level 
of 25 metabolites may be useful in distinguishing CeD patients from healthy 
controls, which have the potential to be considered candidate biomarkers of CeD.
