Gene coding for progranulin, GRN, is a major gene linked to frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration. While most of pathogenic GRN mutations are null mutations leading 
to haploinsufficiency, GRN missense mutations do not have an obvious 
pathogenicity, and only a few have been revealed to act through different 
pathogenetic mechanisms, such as cytoplasmic missorting, protein degradation, 
and abnormal cleavage by elastase. The aim of this study was to disclose the 
pathogenetic mechanisms of the GRN A199V missense mutation, which was previously 
reported not to alter physiological progranulin features but was associated with 
a reduced plasma progranulin level. After investigating the family pedigree, we 
performed genetic and biochemical analysis on its members and performed RNA 
expression studies. We found that the mutation segregates with the disease and 
discovered that its pathogenic feature is the alteration of GRN mRNA splicing, 
actually leading to haploinsufficiency. Thus, when facing with a missense GRN 
mutation, its pathogenetic effects should be investigated, especially if 
associated with low plasma progranulin levels, to determine its nature of either 
benign polymorphism or pathogenic mutation.
