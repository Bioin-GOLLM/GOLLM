CONTEXT: The clinical effectiveness of ablative radioiodine treatment of thyroid 
tumors is limited by the availability of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) at 
the plasma membrane (PM) for uptake of ¹³¹I. A significant proportion of 
well-differentiated thyroid tumors are unable to concentrate sufficient 
radioiodine for effective therapy, and in other tumor models such as breast 
tumors, where radioiodine uptake would be an attractive therapeutic option, 
uptake is insufficient.
OBJECTIVE: Pituitary tumor-transforming gene-binding factor (PBF; PTTG1IP) is 
overexpressed in multiple cancers and significantly decreases NIS expression at 
the PM. The goal of this study was to identify a method by which PBF repression 
of NIS may be overcome in human tumors.
RESULTS: Here, we identify PBF as a tyrosine phosphoprotein that specifically 
binds the proto-oncogene tyrosine protein kinase Src in mass spectrometry, 
glutathione S-transferase pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Src 
induction leads to phosphorylation at PBF residue Y174. Abrogation of this 
residue results in PM retention and a markedly reduced ability to bind NIS. The 
Src inhibitor PP1 inhibits PBF phosphorylation in multiple cell lines in vitro, 
including human primary thyroid cells. Of direct clinical importance to the 
treatment of thyroid cancer, PP1 stimulates iodide uptake by transfected NIS in 
TPC1 thyroid carcinoma cells and entirely overcomes PBF repression of iodide 
uptake in human primary thyroid cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that targeting PBF phosphorylation at residue Y174 via 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the 
efficacy of ablative radioiodine treatment in thyroid and other endocrine and 
endocrine-related tumors.
