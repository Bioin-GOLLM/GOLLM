BACKGROUND: We have previously demonstrated that the expression of kruppel-like 
transcription factor-4 (KLF-4) is upregulated in astrocytes following acute 
ischemic stroke (AIS) and found that KLF4 confers vascular protection against 
cerebral ischemic injury. However, the functional role of KLF4 in astrocyte 
after AIS is far from clear.
METHODS: The intrinsic relationship between KLF4 and A1/A2 reactive astrocytes 
and the impact of astrocytic KLF4 on the activation of A1/A2 subtype astrocytes 
were evaluated in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice and 
oxygen-glucose deprivation and restoration (OGD/R) astrocytes.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that astrocytic KLF4 expression and complement 
C3-positive A1 and S100 calcium binding protein A10 (S100A10)-positive A2 
astrocytes were induced in the ischemic penumbra following focal cerebral 
ischemia, and the time course of upregulation of astrocytic KLF4 correlated 
closely with the activation of A2 astrocytes. The dual immunofluorescent studies 
displayed that in the ischemic hemisphere, where the high levels of KLF4 were 
expressed, there were relatively low levels of C3 expressed in the reactive 
astrocytes and vice versa, but KLF4 was always co-stained well with S100A10. 
Mechanistic analyses revealed that astrocytic KLF4 inhibited the activation of 
A1 astrocyte but promoted A2 astrocyte polarization after OGD/R by modulating 
expressions of nuclear factor-kB.
CONCLUSIONS: Astrocyte-derived KLF4 has a critical role in regulating the 
activation of A1/A2 reactive astrocytes following AIS.
