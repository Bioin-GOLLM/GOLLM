RATIONALE: Safety signals providing relief are hypothesised to possess 
conditioned reinforcing properties, supporting the acquisition of a new response 
(AnR) as seen with appetitive stimuli. Such responding should also be sensitive 
to the rate-increasing effects of d-amphetamine and to the anxiolytics 8-OH-DPAT 
and diazepam.
OBJECTIVES: This study tests whether safety signals have conditioned reinforcing 
properties similar to those of stimuli-predicting reward.
METHODS: Rats received Pavlovian conditioning with either appetitive stimuli 
(CS+) or safety signals (conditioned inhibitors, CIs) plus truly random control 
(TRC) stimuli. The appetitive group received a CS + paired with a sucrose pellet 
and the safety signal group, a stimulus paired with shock omission. Stimuli were 
tested using an AnR procedure and following systemic d-amphetamine, the 5HT-1A 
agonist 8-OH-DPAT and the benzodiazepine diazepam in a counterbalanced design.
RESULTS: Effective conditioning selectively reduced contextual freezing during 
CI presentation in the safety signal group and increased food magazine responses 
(with respect to context and TRC) during CS + presentation in the appetitive 
group. The appetitive stimulus strongly supported AnR but the safety signal did 
not. Systemic d-amphetamine significantly potentiated lever pressing in the 
appetitive group but for the safety signal group, it either reduced it or had no 
effect, dependent on food deprivation state. 8-OH-DPAT and diazepam had no 
effect on responding in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: The safety signal did not support AnR and, therefore, did not 
exhibit conditioned reinforcing properties. Furthermore, d-amphetamine decreased 
responding when the safety signal was presented as a consequence, whilst 
increasing responding with appetitive-conditioned reinforcement. These results 
are discussed in terms of implications for opponent motivational theory.
