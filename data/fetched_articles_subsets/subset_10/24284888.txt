The NAD-synthesizing enzyme NMNAT2 is critical for axon survival in primary 
culture and its depletion may contribute to axon degeneration in a variety of 
neurodegenerative disorders. Here we discuss several recent reports from our 
laboratory that establish a critical role for NMNAT2 in axon growth in vivo in 
mice and shed light on the delivery and turnover of this survival factor in 
axons. In the absence of NMNAT2, axons fail to extend more than a short distance 
beyond the cell body during embryonic development, implying a requirement for 
NMNAT2 in axon maintenance even during development. Furthermore, we highlight 
findings regarding the bidirectional trafficking of NMNAT2 in axons on a vesicle 
population that undergoes fast axonal transport in primary culture neurites and 
in mouse sciatic nerve axons in vivo. Surprisingly, loss of vesicle association 
boosts the axon protective capacity of NMNAT2, an effect that is at least 
partially mediated by a longer protein half-life of cytosolic NMNAT2 variants. 
Analysis of wild-type and variant NMNAT2 in mouse sciatic nerves and Drosophila 
olfactory receptor neuron axons supports the existence of a similar mechanism in 
vivo, highlighting the potential for regulation of NMNAT2 stability and turnover 
as a mechanism to modulate axon degeneration in vivo.
