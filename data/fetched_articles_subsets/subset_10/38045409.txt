Mitochondrial (MT) mutations serve as natural genetic markers for inferring 
clonal relationships using single cell sequencing data. However, the fundamental 
challenge of MT mutation-based lineage tracing is automated identification of 
informative MT mutations. Here, we introduced an open-source computational 
algorithm called "MitoTracer", which accurately identified clonally informative 
MT mutations and inferred evolutionary lineage from scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq 
samples. We benchmarked MitoTracer using the ground-truth experimental lineage 
sequencing data and demonstrated its superior performance over the existing 
methods measured by high sensitivity and specificity. MitoTracer is compatible 
with multiple single cell sequencing platforms. Its application to a cancer 
evolution dataset revealed the genes related to primary BRAF-inhibitor 
resistance from scRNA-seq data of BRAF-mutated cancer cells. Overall, our work 
provided a valuable tool for capturing real informative MT mutations and tracing 
the lineages among cells.
