The complement cascade is a highly sophisticated network of proteins that are 
well regulated and directed in response to invading pathogens or tissue injury. 
Complement C3a and C5a are key mediators produced by this cascade, and their 
dysregulation has been linked to a plethora of inflammatory and autoimmune 
diseases. Consequently, this has stimulated interest in the development of 
ligands for the receptors for these complement peptides, C3a receptor, and C5a1 
(C5aR/CD88). In this study we used computational methods to design novel C5a1 
receptor ligands. However, functional screening in human monocyte-derived 
macrophages using the xCELLigence label-free platform demonstrated altered 
specificity of our ligands. No agonist/antagonist activity was observed at C5a1, 
but we instead saw that the ligands were able to partially agonize the closely 
related complement receptor C3a receptor. This was verified in the presence of 
C3a receptor antagonist SB 290157 and in a stable cell line expressing either 
C5a1 or C3a receptor alone. C3a agonism has been suggested to be a potential 
treatment of acute neutrophil-driven traumatic pathologies, and may have great 
potential as a therapeutic avenue in this arena.
