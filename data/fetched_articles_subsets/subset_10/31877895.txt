The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) catalyzes the synthesis of the 
multifunctional second messenger, cGAMP, in metazoans. Although numerous cGAS 
homologues are predicted in protein databases, the catalytic activity towards 
cGAMP synthesis has been proven for only four of them. Therefore, we selected 
five novel and yet uncharacterized cGAS homologues, which cover a broad range in 
the field of vertebrates. Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) was used for a 
pre-screening to investigate if the cGAS genes originating from higher organisms 
can be efficiently expressed in a bacterial expression system. As all tested 
cGAS variants were expressible, enzymes were synthesized in vivo to supply 
higher amounts for a subsequent in vitro activity assay. The assays were carried 
out with purified enzymes and revealed vast differences in the activity of the 
homologues. For the first time, the cGAS homologues from the Przewalski's horse, 
naked mole-rat, bald eagle, and zebrafish were proven to catalyze the synthesis 
of cGAMP. The extension of the list of described cGAS variants enables the 
acquisition of further knowledge about the structural and molecular mechanism of 
cGAS, potentially leading to functional improvement of the enzyme.
