The carboxyl reagent N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) and 
dansyl-ethylenediamine have shown to inhibit human renal dipeptidase (hrDP) 
irreversibly in a time-dependent manner. Cilastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 
the enzyme, partially protected the enzyme from inactivation. To identify the 
site(s) modified by EEDQ and dansylethylenediamine, the amino-acid sequence of 
tryptic fragments of modified enzyme were analyzed extensively. A comparison of 
the determined amino-acid sequences with the predicted primary structure of hrDP 
revealed that Glu-125 within the Glu115-Arg138 fragment was modified. In 
consequence, the role of Glu-125 in catalytic activity was investigated by 
site-directed mutagenesis. Glu-125 was replaced by a glutamine, aspartic acid or 
cysteine residue. cDNAs for wild-type or mutated enzymes were expressed in CHO 
cells, and the resulting proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity. The 
mutated enzyme, Gln-125-hrDP exhibited specific activity of 28.5 U/mg, 
corresponding to 11.4% of the wild-type. In contrast, Asp-125-hrDP and 
Cys-125hrDP were found to be inactive (< or = 0.1% of wild-type enzyme). These 
results suggest that the polarity and/or length of the side chain of Glu-125 
residue are important for the enzyme activity.
