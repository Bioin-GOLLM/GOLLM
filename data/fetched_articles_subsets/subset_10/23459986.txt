IMPORTANCE: Mutations in the gene encoding parkin (PARK2) are the most common 
cause of autosomal recessive juvenile-onset and young-onset parkinsonism. The 
few available detailed neuropathologic reports suggest that homozygous and 
compound heterozygous parkin mutations are characterized by severe substantia 
nigra pars compacta neuronal loss.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether parkin-linked parkinsonism is a different 
clinicopathologic entity to Parkinson disease (PD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We describe the clinical, genetic, and 
neuropathologic findings of 5 unrelated cases of parkin disease and compare them 
with 5 pathologically confirmed PD cases and 4 control subjects. The PD control 
cases and normal control subjects were matched first for age at death then 
disease duration (PD only) for comparison.
RESULTS: Presenting signs in the parkin disease cases were hand or leg tremor 
often combined with dystonia. Mean age at onset was 34 years; all cases were 
compound heterozygous for mutations of parkin. Freezing of gait, postural 
deformity, and motor fluctuations were common late features. No patients had any 
evidence of cognitive impairment or dementia. Neuronal counts in the substantia 
nigra pars compacta revealed that neuronal loss in the parkin cases was as 
severe as that seen in PD, but relative preservation of the dorsal tier was seen 
in comparison with PD (P = .04). Mild neuronal loss was identified in the locus 
coeruleus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, but not in the nucleus basalis 
of Meynert, raphe nucleus, or other brain regions. Sparse Lewy bodies were 
identified in 2 cases (brainstem and cortex).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings support the notion that parkin disease 
is characterized by a more restricted morphologic abnormality than is found in 
PD, with predominantly ventral nigral degeneration and absent or rare Lewy 
bodies.
