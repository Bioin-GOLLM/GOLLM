PURPOSE: We performed exome sequencing in a breast cancer family without BRCA 
mutations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A family that three sisters have a history of breast 
cancer was selected for analysis. There were no family members with breast 
cancer in the previous generation. Genetic testing for BRCA mutation was 
negative, even by the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method. 
Two sisters with breast cancer were selected as affected members, while the 
mother of the sisters was a non-affected member. Whole exome sequencing was 
performed on the HiSeq 2000 platform with paired-end reads of 101 bp in the 
three members.
RESULTS: We identified 19,436, 19,468, and 19,345 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding regions. Among them, 8,759, 8,789, and 8,772 
were non-synonymous SNPs, respectively. After filtering out 12,843 synonymous 
variations and 12,105 known variations with indels found in the dbSNP135 or 1000 
Genomes Project database, we selected 73 variations in the samples from the 
affected sisters that did not occur in the sample from the unaffected mother. 
Using the Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT), PolyPhen-2, and 
MutationTaster algorithms to predict amino acid substitutions, the XCR1, DLL1, 
TH, ACCS, SPPL3, CCNF, and SRL genes were risky among all three algorithms, 
while definite candidate genes could not be conclusively determined.
CONCLUSION: Using exome sequencing, we found 7 variants for a breast cancer 
family without BRCA mutations. Genetic evidence of disease association should be 
confirmed by future studies.
