The optimal treatment of depressed patients remains one of the most important 
challenges concerning depression. The identification of the best treatment 
strategies and development of new, safer, and more effective agents are crucial. 
The glutamatergic system seems to be a promising drug target, and consequently 
the use of the NMDA receptor ligands, particularly in co-administration with 
other substances exerting the antidepressant activity, has emerged among the new 
ideas. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of caffeine on the 
performance of mice treated with various NMDA modulators in the forced swim 
test. We demonstrated a significant interaction between caffeine (5 mg/kg) and 
the following NMDA receptor ligands: MK-801 (an antagonist binding in the ion 
channel, 0.05 mg/kg), CGP 37849 (an antagonist of the glutamate site, 0.312 
mg/kg), L-701,324 (an antagonist of the glycine site, 1 mg/kg), and 
D-cycloserine (a high-efficacy partial agonist of the glycine site, 2.5 mg/kg), 
while the interaction between caffeine and the inorganic modulators, i.e., 
Zn(2+) (2.5 mg/kg) and Mg(2+) (10 mg/kg), was not considered as significant. 
Based on the obtained results, the simultaneous blockage of the adenosine and 
NMDA receptors may be a promising target in the development of new 
antidepressants.
