BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend a standard ticagrelor loading dose (LD) 
in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. However, 
antiplatelet therapy in STEMI patients at high risk of thrombotic events is 
suboptimal. The study was conducted to validate whether vasodilatorstimulated 
phosphoprotein (VASP)-guided ticagrelor dosing individual therapy may result in 
more effective platelet inhibition and better clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This trial included 374 STEMI patients with a low platelet response 
after ticagrelor LD. The patients were randomized into a control group and a 
VASP-guided group, where the ticagrelor pretreatment was individually adjusted 
before and after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to obtain a VASP index 
< 50%. Up to 2 additional boluses of ticagrelor (every additional dosing was 90 
mg) were prescribed after the first LD, and the VASP index was assessed 2 hours 
after each administration until a VASP index < 50% was obtained or up to 3 
dosages (360 mg). The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACEs) at 30 days. The secondary endpoints were thrombolysis in myocardial 
infarction (TIMI) major and minor bleeding.
RESULTS: The characteristics were similar in the two groups. After the 
ticagrelor doses increased, the platelet reactivity index (PRI) decreased, and 
98.4% of patients reached PRI < 50% in the VASP-guided group. The adenosine 
concentration increased, and the rate of MACE was significantly lower in the 
VASP-guided group (10 [5.3%] vs. 20 [10.8%], hazard ratio 2.38, 95% confidence 
interval 1.21-3.28, p = 0.007). There were no major hemorrhagic complications (0 
vs. 0, p = 1.0). The rate of minor bleeding in the VASP-guided group was higher 
than that in the control group, but the difference was not significant (24 
[12.8%] vs. 16 [8.6%], p = 0.068).
CONCLUSIONS: The incremental ticagrelor dosing strategy decreases the rate of 
MACE after PCI without increasing major and minor bleeding.
