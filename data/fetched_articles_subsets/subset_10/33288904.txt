Measurement of the location of molecules in tissues is essential for 
understanding tissue formation and function. Previously, we developed Slide-seq, 
a technology that enables transcriptome-wide detection of RNAs with a spatial 
resolution of 10 μm. Here we report Slide-seqV2, which combines improvements in 
library generation, bead synthesis and array indexing to reach an RNA capture 
efficiency ~50% that of single-cell RNA-seq data (~10-fold greater than 
Slide-seq), approaching the detection efficiency of droplet-based single-cell 
RNA-seq techniques. First, we leverage the detection efficiency of Slide-seqV2 
to identify dendritically localized mRNAs in neurons of the mouse hippocampus. 
Second, we integrate the spatial information of Slide-seqV2 data with 
single-cell trajectory analysis tools to characterize the spatiotemporal 
development of the mouse neocortex, identifying underlying genetic programs that 
were poorly sampled with Slide-seq. The combination of near-cellular resolution 
and high transcript detection efficiency makes Slide-seqV2 useful across many 
experimental contexts.
