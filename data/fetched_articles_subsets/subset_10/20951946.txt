This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article 
Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article has 
been retracted at the request of the editors. This article was published on 
October 19, 2010, and Figures 4A and 7A were later corrected on August 8, 2016. 
In January 2021, The Ohio State University notified the Cancer Cell editors that 
an internal investigation concluded that Figures 1E, 4A, 4D, 5A, and 7A were 
falsified and that part of Figure 1E of the article is the same as part of 
Figure 1F in the correction of another article (Pichiorri et al., 2017, J. Exp. 
Med., 214, 1557, https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.2012095001172017c) and recommended 
retraction of the article. The editors no longer have confidence in the validity 
of the data and are retracting the article. S.-S. S. agrees with the retraction, 
and F.P., C.H., A.P., and C.M.C. disagree with the retraction; all other authors 
couldn't be reached or didn't respond.
