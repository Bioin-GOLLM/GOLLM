Protein S is a protein C-dependent and independent inhibitor of the coagulation 
cascade. Deficiency of protein S is an established risk factor for venous 
thromboembolism. We have used a strategy of specific amplification of the coding 
regions and intron/exon boundaries of the active protein S gene (PROS1) and 
direct single-strand solid phase sequencing, to seek mutations in 35 individuals 
with phenotypic protein S deficiency. Nineteen point mutations (16 novel) in 19 
probands (or relatives of probands) with venous thromboembolism are reported 
here. Fifteen of the 19 mutations were expected to be causal and included 10 
missense mutations (Lys9Glu, Glu26Ala, Gly54Glu, Cys145Tyr, Cys200Ser, 
Ser283Pro, Gly340Asp, Cys408Ser, Ser460Pro, and Cys625Arg). Three of the 15 
mutations resulted in premature stop codons (delete T 635 producing a stop codon 
at position 126, Lys368stop and Tyr595stop) and two were at intron/exon 
boundaries (+1 G to A in intron d and +3 A to C in intron j). Of the remaining 
four mutations, three were within intronic sequence and one was a silent 
mutation within the coding region and did not alter amino acid composition. In 
two of the 10 missense mutations, reduced plasma protein S activity compared 
with antigen level suggested the presence of variant (type II) protein S.
