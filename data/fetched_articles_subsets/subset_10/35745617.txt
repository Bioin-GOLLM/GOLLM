Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer subtype. 
Although chemotherapy and targeted therapy are used for the treatment of 
patients with NSCLC, the survival rate remains very low. Recent findings 
suggested that aurora kinase A (AKA), a cell cycle regulator, is a potential 
target for NSCLC therapy. Previously, we reported that a chemical entity of 
quinazolin-4(3H)-one represents a new template for AKA inhibitors, with 
antiproliferative activity against cancer cells. A quinazolin-4(3H)-one 
derivative was further designed and synthesized in order to improve the 
pharmacokinetic properties and antiproliferation activity against NSCLC cell 
lines. The derivative, BIQO-19 (Ethyl 
6-(4-oxo-3-(pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-6-yl)imidazo 
[1,2-a]pyridine-2-carboxylate), exhibited improved solubility and 
antiproliferative activity in NSCLC cells, including epidermal growth factor 
receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-resistant NSCLC cells. BIQO-19 
effectively inhibited the growth of the EGFR-TKI-resistant H1975 NSCLC cells, 
with the suppression of activated AKA (p-AKA) expression in these cells. The 
inhibition of AKA by BIQO-19 significantly induced G2/M phase arrest and 
subsequently evoked apoptosis in H1975 cells. In addition, the combination of 
gefitinib and BIQO-19 exhibited synergistic antiproliferative activity in NSCLC 
cells. These findings suggest the potential of BIQO-19 as a novel therapeutic 
agent for restoring the sensitivity of gefitinib in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC 
cells.
