BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with Interferon- γ (IFN-γ) 
mediated T-lymphocyte dysfunction and increased circulating Interleukine-17 
(IL-17) levels. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) specifically inhibits IFN-γ 
pathways and unlike Janus Kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitors (tofacitinib, 
ruxolitinib), EGCG is safer, more cost-effective, and is a topically active 
agent. Our objective is to test the mode of action of EGCG in vitro and ex vivo 
using HaCat, Jurkat cell lines, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
of AA patients and healthy controls (HCs), respectively.
METHODS: distribution of T helper cells (Th1, Th17), and cytotoxic cells (CD8) 
in PBMCs isolated from 30 AA patients and 30 HCs was investigated by 
flowcytomterty. In vitro treatment of HaCat and Jurkat cells with 40 μm EGCG for 
48 h was performed to measure the level of phosphorylation of signal transducer 
and activator of transcription protein STAT1, and replicated in ex vivo model 
using PBMCs of AA patients.
RESULTS: Interestingly, 40 μm EGCG is capable of completely inhibiting 
phosphorylation of STAT1 after 48 h in HaCat and Jurkat cells and ex vivo in 
PBMCs of AA patients. Based on QPCR data, the action of EGCG on p-STAT1 seems to 
be mediated via downregulation of the expression of JAK2 but not JAK1 leading to 
the inhibition of human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR and HLA-B) expression 
probably via IRF-1. On the other hand, AA patients have significantly increased 
levels of Th1, Th17, and CD8 cells and the production of IFN-γ and IL-17 by 
PBMCs in AA patients was significantly higher compared to HC; p = 0.008 and p = 
0.006, respectively. Total numbers of CD8+ cells were not significantly 
different between treated and untreated samples. However, CD8+ cells with 
positive Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) transmembrane receptor (CD8+ 
NKG2D+ subset) was significantly reduced when PBMCs were treated with 20 μm EGCG 
for 48 h.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that EGCG has a synergistic action that 
inhibits expression of HLA-DR and HLA-B molecules via the IFN-γ pathway to 
maintain immune privilege in HF; also it reduces CD8+ NKG2D+ subset.
