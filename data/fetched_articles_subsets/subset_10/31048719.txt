Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a powerful tool to 
investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD), and 
might provide novel platforms for systematic drug screening. Several strategies 
have been developed to generate iPSC-derived tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive 
dopaminergic neurons (DAn), the clinically relevant cell type in PD; however, 
they often result in mixed neuronal cultures containing only a small proportion 
of TH-positive DAn. To overcome this limitation, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based 
editing to generate a human iPSC line expressing a fluorescent protein (mOrange) 
knocked-in at the last exon of the TH locus. After differentiation of the 
TH-mOrange reporter iPSC line, we confirmed that mOrange expression faithfully 
mimicked endogenous TH expression in iPSC-derived DAn. We also employed calcium 
imaging techniques to determine the intrinsic functional differences between 
dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic ventral midbrain neurons. Crucially, the 
brightness of mOrange allowed direct visualization of TH-expressing cells in 
heterogeneous cultures, and enabled us to isolate live mOrange-positive cells 
through fluorescence-activated cell sorting, for further differentiation. This 
technique, coupled to refined imaging and data processing tools, could advance 
the investigation of PD pathogenesis and might offer a platform to test 
potential new therapeutics for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
