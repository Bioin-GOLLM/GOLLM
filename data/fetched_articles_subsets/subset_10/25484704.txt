In the title compound, C26H20O3, the pyran ring has a distorted half-chair 
conformation and its mean plane is inclined to the naphthalene ring system, to 
which it is fused, by 10.79 (9)°. The dihedral angles between the napthalene 
unit and the benzene and phenyl rings are 54.39 (9) and 52.65 (12)°, 
respectively, while the benzene and phenyl rings are inclined to one another by 
74.80 (14)°. There is a short C-H⋯O contact in the chromen-1-one unit. In the 
crystal, mol-ecules are linked by two pairs of C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming 
inversion dimers described by graph set motifs R 2 (2)(8) and R 2 (2)(10), 
giving rise to chains running parallel to (101). The chains are linked via C-H⋯π 
inter-actions, forming sheets lying parallel to (010).
