The induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes by STATs is a critical host 
defense mechanism against virus infection. Here, we report that a highly 
expressed poxvirus protein, 018, inhibits IFN-induced signaling by binding to 
the SH2 domain of STAT1, thereby preventing the association of STAT1 with an 
activated IFN receptor. Despite encoding other inhibitors of IFN-induced 
signaling, a poxvirus mutant lacking 018 was attenuated in mice. The 2.0 Å 
crystal structure of the 018:STAT1 complex reveals a phosphotyrosine-independent 
mode of 018 binding to the SH2 domain of STAT1. Moreover, the STAT1-binding 
motif of 018 shows similarity to the STAT1-binding proteins from Nipah virus, 
which, similar to 018, block the association of STAT1 with an IFN receptor. 
Overall, these results uncover a conserved mechanism of STAT1 antagonism that is 
employed independently by distinct virus families.
