The normal androgen receptor (AR) cistrome and transcriptional program are 
fundamentally altered in prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we profile the chromatin 
landscape and AR-directed transcriptional program in normal prostate cells and 
show the impact of SPOP mutations, an early event in prostate tumorigenesis. In 
genetically normal mouse prostate organoids, SPOP mutation results in 
accessibility and AR binding patterns similar to that of human PCa. Consistent 
with dependence on AR signaling, castration of SPOP mutant mouse models results 
in the loss of neoplastic phenotypes, and human SPOP mutant PCa shows a 
favorable response to AR-targeted therapies. Together, these data validate mouse 
prostate organoids as a robust model for studying epigenomic and transcriptional 
alterations in normal prostate, provide valuable datasets for further studies, 
and show that a single genomic alteration may be sufficient to reprogram the 
chromatin of normal prostate cells toward oncogenic phenotypes, with potential 
therapeutic implications for AR-targeting therapies.
