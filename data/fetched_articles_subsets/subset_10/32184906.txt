BACKGROUND: Fibroblast dysfunction is the main pathogenic mechanism underpinning 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J 
member 2 (KCNJ2) plays critical roles in the proliferation of myofibroblasts and 
in the development of cardiac fibrosis.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the role of KCNJ2 in IPF.
METHODS: KCNJ2 mRNA expression was measured using real-time PCR in fibroblasts 
from IPF patients and normal controls (NCs). Protein concentrations were 
measured by ELISA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from NCs 
(n = 30), IPF (n = 30), IPF (n = 30), IPF (n = 30), IPF (n = 30), IPF (.
RESULTS: KCNJ2 mRNA expression was measured using real-time PCR in fibroblasts 
from IPF patients and normal controls (NCs). Protein concentrations were 
measured by ELISA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from NCs 
(n = 30), IPF (n = 30), IPF (p < 0.001). KCNJ2 protein levels in BAL fluid were 
significantly higher in IPF (6.587 [1.441-26.01] ng/mL) than in NCs (0.084 
[0.00-0.260] ng/mL, p < 0.001). KCNJ2 protein levels in BAL fluid were 
significantly higher in IPF (6.587 [1.441-26.01] ng/mL) than in NCs (0.084 
[0.00-0.260] ng/mL, p < 0.001). KCNJ2 protein levels in BAL fluid were 
significantly higher in IPF (6.587 [1.441-26.01] ng/mL) than in NCs (0.084 
[0.00-0.260] ng/mL, p < 0.001). KCNJ2 protein levels in BAL fluid were 
significantly higher in IPF (6.587 [1.441-26.01] ng/mL) than in NCs (0.084 
[0.00-0.260] ng/mL, p < 0.001). KCNJ2 protein levels in BAL fluid were 
significantly higher in IPF (6.587 [1.441-26.01] ng/mL) than in NCs (0.084 
[0.00-0.260] ng/mL.
CONCLUSION: KCNJ2 may participate in the development of IPF, and its protein 
level may be a candidate diagnostic and therapeutic molecule for IPF.
