BACKGROUND: The recessive form of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular 
tachycardia 2 (CPVT2) is caused by mutations in cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2), 
leading to protein deficiency.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to develop a viral-delivered gene 
therapy for CPVT2 and to determine the relationship between CASQ2 expression and 
antiarrhythmic efficacy in a murine model.
METHODS: We used a murine model of CPVT2 caused by the D307H human mutation 
(CASQ2D307H) or CASQ2 knockout (CASQ2Δ/Δ). Adeno-associated virus (AAV) 
particles containing the CASQ2 gene (AAVCASQ2) were injected into the heart or 
intraperitoneally to 12-week-old mice. A telemetry device was implanted, and 
mice underwent provocation testing 7-8 weeks after gene therapy.
RESULTS: CASQ2Δ/Δ mice injected intracardiacally with AAVCASQ2 expressed 40% ± 
25% of the normal CASQ2 protein level, which was increased compared to untreated 
CASQ2Δ/Δ mice (n = 10; P < .05). Intraperitoneal therapy led to a significantly 
elevated expression of the CASQ2 protein, which was comparable in CASQ2D307H (n 
= 12) and CASQ2Δ/Δ (n = 4) mice. All control mice with CPVT2 had nonsustained 
ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 8 of 13 had sustained VT on provocation. 
Expressing ≥33% of the normal CASQ2 level was needed to protect from 
nonsustained VT as well as stress-induced premature ventricular contractions. 
Lower levels of expression prevented sustained VT in AAVCASQ2-treated mice (0 of 
26; P < .001 vs controls).
CONCLUSION: AAVCASQ2 displays a long-lasting capacity to attenuate and 
potentially cure CPVT2. Systemic delivery is feasible and convenient, 
reproducibly providing adequate levels of transgene expression. Antiarrhythmic 
efficacy depends on the CASQ2 level: ≥33% of the normal CASQ2 level is needed to 
prevent arrhythmia. However, even lower levels of protein protect from sustained 
VT, thereby potentially reducing the risk of sudden death.
