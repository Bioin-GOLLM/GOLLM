Mast cells (MCs) are bone marrow-derived cells capable of secreting many active 
molecules, ranging from the mediators stored in specific granules, some of which 
have been known about for several decades (histamine, heparin), to small 
molecules produced immediately upon stimulation (membrane lipid derivatives, 
nitric oxide), to a host of constitutively secreted, multifunctional cytokines. 
With the aid of a wide array of mediators, the activated MCs control the key 
events of inflammation and therefore participate in the regulation of local 
immune response. On the basis of the structure, origin, principal subtypes, 
localization and function of these cells, their involvement in injury repair is 
therefore to be considered in acute and chronic conditions, respectively. The 
importance of MCs in regulating the healing processes is underscored by the 
proposed roles of a surplus or a deficit of their mediators in the formation of 
exuberant granulation tissue (such as keloids and hypertrophic scars), the 
delayed closure or dehiscence of wounds and the transition of acute to chronic 
inflammation.
