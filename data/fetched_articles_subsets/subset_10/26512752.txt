Genes involved in circadian regulation, such as circadian locomotor output 
cycles kaput [CLOCK], cryptochrome [CRY1] and period [PER], have been associated 
with sleep outcomes in prior animal and human research. However, it is unclear 
whether polymorphisms in these genes are associated with the sleep disturbances 
commonly experienced by adults living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Thus, the purpose of this study was to 
describe polymorphisms in selected circadian genes that are associated with 
sleep duration or disruption as well as the sleep-wake rhythm strength and phase 
timing among adults living with HIV/AIDS. A convenience sample of 289 adults 
with HIV/AIDS was recruited from HIV clinics and community sites in the San 
Francisco Bay Area. A wrist actigraph was worn for 72â€‰h on weekdays to estimate 
sleep duration or total sleep time (TST), sleep disruption or percentage of wake 
after sleep onset (WASO) and several circadian rhythm parameters: mesor, 
amplitude, the ratio of mesor to amplitude (circadian quotient), and 24-h 
autocorrelation. Circadian phase measures included clock time for peak activity 
(acrophase) from actigraphy movement data, and bed time and final wake time from 
actigraphy and self-report. Genotyping was conducted for polymorphisms in five 
candidate genes involved in circadian regulation: CLOCK, CRY1, PER1, PER2 and 
PER3. Demographic and clinical variables were evaluated as potential covariates. 
Interactions between genotype and HIV variables (i.e. viral load, years since 
HIV diagnosis) were also evaluated. Controlling for potentially confounding 
variables (e.g. race, gender, CD4+ T-cell count, waist circumference, medication 
use, smoking and depressive symptoms), CLOCK was associated with WASO, 24-h 
autocorrelation and objectively-measured bed time; CRY1 was associated with 
circadian quotient; PER1 was associated with mesor and self-reported habitual 
wake time; PER2 was associated with TST, mesor, circadian quotient, 24-h 
autocorrelation and bed and wake times; PER3 was associated with amplitude, 24-h 
autocorrelation, acrophase and bed and wake times. Most of the observed 
associations involved a significant interaction between genotype and HIV. In 
this chronic illness population, polymorphisms in several circadian genes were 
associated with measures of sleep disruption and timing. These findings extend 
the evidence for an association between genetic variability in circadian 
regulation and sleep outcomes to include the sleep-wake patterns experienced by 
adults living with HIV/AIDS. These results provide direction for future 
intervention research related to circadian sleep-wake behavior patterns.
