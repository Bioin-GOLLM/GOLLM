Maximum tolerable dosing (MTD) of chemotherapeutics has long been the gold 
standard for aggressive malignancies. Recently, alternative dosing strategies 
have gained traction for their improved toxicity profiles and unique mechanisms 
of action, such as inhibition of angiogenesis and stimulation of immunity. In 
this article, we investigated whether extended exposure (EE) topotecan could 
improve long-term drug sensitivity by preventing drug resistance. To achieve 
significantly longer exposure times, we used a spheroidal model system of 
castration-resistant prostate cancer. We also used state-of-the-art 
transcriptomic analysis to further elucidate any underlying phenotypic changes 
that occurred in the malignant population following each treatment. We 
determined that EE topotecan had a much higher barrier to resistance relative to 
MTD topotecan and was able to maintain consistent efficacy throughout the study 
period (EE IC50 of 54.4 nM (Week 6) vs. MTD IC50 of 2200 nM (Week 6) vs. 83.8 nM 
IC50 for control (Week 6) vs. 37.8 nM IC50 for control (Week 0)). As a possible 
explanation for these results, we determined that MTD topotecan stimulated 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), upregulated efflux pumps, and produced 
altered topoisomerases relative to EE topotecan. Overall, EE topotecan resulted 
in a more sustained treatment response and maintained a less aggressive 
malignant phenotype relative to MTD topotecan.
