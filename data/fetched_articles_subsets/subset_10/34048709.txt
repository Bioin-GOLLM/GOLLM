N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNAs mediates different biological processes and 
its dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis. How m6A dictates its diverse 
molecular and cellular effects in leukemias remains unknown. We found that 
YTHDC1 is the essential m6A reader in myeloid leukemia from a genome-wide CRISPR 
screen and that m6A is required for YTHDC1 to undergo liquid-liquid phase 
separation and form nuclear YTHDC1-m6A condensates (nYACs). The number of nYACs 
increases in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells compared with normal 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. AML cells require the nYACs to maintain 
cell survival and the undifferentiated state that is critical for leukemia 
maintenance. Furthermore, nYACs enable YTHDC1 to protect m6A-mRNAs from the PAXT 
complex and exosome-associated RNA degradation. Collectively, m6A is required 
for the formation of a nuclear body mediated by phase separation that maintains 
mRNA stability and control cancer cell survival and differentiation.
