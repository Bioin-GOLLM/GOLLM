BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: An adjusted indirect comparison was conducted to 
assess efficacy outcomes, particularly overall survival (OS), of osimertinib 
versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in patients with epidermal growth 
factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) T790M mutation-positive non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) who had progressed following an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI). Analysis of treatment effect from two separate trials had the potential 
to more accurately estimate the magnitude of OS benefit due to absence of 
confounding due to treatment switching from the control arm to the osimertinib 
arm of the ongoing randomized control trial, AURA3.
METHODS: Two non-randomized individual datasets were compared: pooled patients 
from the AURA extension and AURA2 trials (osimertinib 80 mg, n = 405, with a 
confirmed T790M mutation using tissue samples), and patients from the control 
arm of the IMPRESS study (platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, n = 61, with a 
confirmed T790M mutation using plasma circulating tumour DNA [ctDNA]). A 
propensity score-based approach was used to account for differences in baseline 
demographics and disease characteristics.
RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline differences between the two groups, 
osimertinib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in 
progression-free survival (PFS) versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 0.278, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.188-0.409, 
p < 0.0001; median PFS 10.9 vs. 5.3 months). Improvements were also observed for 
objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) (ORR: 64.3 vs. 
33.3%; odds ratio [OR] = 5.31, 95% CI 2.47-11.40, p < 0.001; DCR: 92.1 vs. 
75.0%; OR = 4.72, 95% CI 1.92-11.58, p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained 
for patients who received osimertinib as second-line treatment only. A 
statistically significant improvement in OS was observed for the osimertinib 
group (HR = 0.412, 95% CI 0.273-0.622, p < 0.0001). Median OS for osimertinib 
was not reached.
CONCLUSIONS: In this indirect comparison, osimertinib showed a statistically 
significant improvement in efficacy outcomes versus platinum-based doublet 
chemotherapy in patients with EGFRm T790M NSCLC who had progressed after 
EGFR-TKI therapy.
