Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) is widely distributed in nature and installs 
a methyl group onto one of the vicinal hydroxyl groups of a catechol derivative. 
Enzymes belonging to this family require two cofactors for methyl transfer: 
S-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl donor and a divalent metal cation for 
regiospecific binding and activation of a substrate. We have determined two 
high-resolution crystal structures of Rv0187, one of three COMT paralogs from 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in the presence and absence of cofactors. The 
cofactor-bound structure clearly locates strontium ions and 
S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine in the active site, and together with the 
complementary structure of the ligand-free form, it suggests conformational 
dynamics induced by the binding of cofactors. Examination of in vitro activities 
revealed promiscuous substrate specificity and relaxed regioselectivity against 
various catechol-like compounds. Unexpectedly, mutation of the proposed 
catalytic lysine residue did not abolish activity but altered the overall 
landscape of regiospecific methylation.
