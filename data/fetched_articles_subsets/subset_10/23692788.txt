Two common MTHFR gene polymorphisms (C677T and A1298C) have been implicated in 
the etiology of nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate (nsCL/P). To investigate the 
genotype association among nsCL/P in the Turkish population, 56 case-parent 
trios were recruited into the study. Genotype frequencies were compared to two 
groups of controls from the same population. A total of 46 case-parent trios 
were included in transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) analysis. The mothers of 
the study group had a higher frequency of 677TT genotype, with a three-fold 
increased risk of having nsCL/P offspring (odds ratio [OR]: 3.14, p=0.03). The 
combined 677CT/1298AC genotype was also common among these mothers (28%), but it 
did not reach statistical significance (OR: 2.27, p=0.07). TDT analysis for 
(C677T) T allele transmission did not reveal a significant association. In 
conclusion, mothers carrying 677TT genotype or with 677CT/1298AC combined 
genotype have increased risk of having nsCL/P offspring; therefore, higher 
periconceptional folic acid supplementation should be advised for decreasing the 
recurrence risk.
