Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line chHES-480 was derived from abnormal 
blastocyst diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) after preimplantation 
genetic diagnosis (PGD) treatment. DNA sequencing analysis confirmed that 
chHES-480 cell line carried a hemizygous missense mutation 
c.1825G>A(p.Glu609Lys) of ABCD1 gene. Characteristic tests proved that the 
chHES-480 cell line presented typical markers of pluripotency and had the 
capability to form the three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo.
