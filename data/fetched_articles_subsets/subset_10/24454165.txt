In the title compound, [Ni(C40H28N4S4)]·0.5C6H6, the Ni(II) atom is in a 
square-planar geometry defined by four pyrrole N atoms. There is considerable 
buckling in the porphyrin ring with the dihedral angles between the N4 donor set 
and the pyrrole rings being in the range 16.24 (5)-22.47 (5)°. Each of the 
six-membered chelate rings is twisted about an Ni-N bond and the dihedral angles 
between diagonally opposite chelate rings are 21.36 (4) and 23.87 (4)°; each 
pair of rings is oriented in opposite directions. The methyl-thienyl rings are 
twisted out of the plane of the central N4 core with dihedral angles in the 
range 75.98 (2)-88.70 (5)°. All four methyl-thienyl groups are disordered over 
two sets of sites, as is commonly found with such groups, with occupancies of 
0.553 (8):0.447 (8), 0.579 (7):0.421 (7), 0.796 (6):0.204 (6) and 
0.956 (7):0.044 (7). The benzene solvent mol-ecule was found to be present in 
half-occupancy.
