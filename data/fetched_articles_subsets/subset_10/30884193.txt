BACKGROUND: The insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is a critical factor in the 
signaling pathway for insulin, and mutations in this gene have been reported, 
which contribute to the ability to develop type 2 diabetes. The polymorphisms in 
the promoter region of C-C motif chemokine receptor5 (CCR5) are also being 
studied as candidates for susceptibility to develop type 2 diabetes. The aim of 
the current study was to determine the relationship between IRS1 and CCR5 
polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes in the Kurdistan population.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from the blood by salt extraction method and 
the polymorphisms were examined using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism 
(RFLP) method.
RESULTS: The results of current study indicated that the frequency of AA 
genotype in type 2 diabetic patients in both CCR5 (OR = 2.9, p = 0.04) and IRS1 
(OR = 3.3, p = 0.036) were significantly more than controls.
CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, the presence of AA genotype 
in both CCR5 and IRS1 is associated with type 2 diabetes. There was no 
significant association between AG or GG genotypes with type 2 diabetes.
