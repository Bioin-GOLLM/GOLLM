BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aim of this work was to compared the effect of lipid 
lowering drugs among familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) subjects with a 
functional mutation in LDLR (LDLR FH) and FH with the p.(Leu167del) mutation in 
APOE.
METHODS: We retrospectively selected all adults with the p.(Leu167del) mutation 
on lipid-lowering treatment (n = 22) attending the Lipid Unit at the Hospital 
Miguel Servet. Age and sex matched LDLR FH from the same Unit were randomly 
selected as a control group (n = 44).
RESULTS: The mean percentage reduction in LDLc was significantly higher in the 
p.(Leu167del) carriers (-52.1%) than in the LDLR FH (-39.7%) (p = 0.040) when on 
high intensity statins. Similar differences between groups were observed in 
non-HDLc -49.4% and -36.4%, respectively (p = 0.030).
CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with p.(Leu167del) mutation have a higher lipid-lowering 
response to statins with or without ezetimibe than LDLR FH. This supports the 
use of genetics for a more efficient management of FH.
