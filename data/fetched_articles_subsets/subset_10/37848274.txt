Xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome complex (XP-CS) is exceedingly rare, 
with 43 cases described over the past five decades; 21 of these cases exhibited 
mutations in the ERCC5 endonuclease associated with xeroderma pigmentosum, group 
G.We report the first known phenotypic characterisation of the homozygous 
chromosome 13 ERCC5, Exon 11, c.2413G>A (p.Gly805Arg) missense mutation in a 
female toddler presenting with findings of both XP and CS.Her severe 
presentation also questions previous hypotheses that only truncating mutations 
and early missense mutations of XPG are capable of producing the dire findings 
of XP-CS.
