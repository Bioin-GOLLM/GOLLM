FAMILY REPORT: Two rare autosomal recessive neurological disorders, 
leukoencephalopathy with ataxia and spastic paraplegia 56 (SPG56), were found in 
members of the same family. Two siblings presented with spastic paraplegia, 
cognitive impairment, bladder and bowel dysfunction and gait ataxia; their 
consanguineous parents were unaffected. Ophthalmological examination revealed 
chorioretinopathy. Brain MRI showed T2 hyperintensities and T1 hypointensities 
in the internal capsules, cerebral peduncles, pyramidal tracts and middle 
cerebellar peduncles. Both affected siblings were homozygous for CYP2U1 
c.947A > T p.(Asp316Val), a known cause for SPG56. However, they were also 
homozygous for the novel variant CLCN2 c.607G > T, p.(Gly203Cys), classified as 
a variant of unknown significance. Testing of additional family members revealed 
homozygosity for both variants in an additional brother, whom we initially 
considered unaffected. Both male CLCN2 carriers were infertile, and review of 
the literature revealed one reported case with azoospermia, however the brother 
had no overt signs of SPG56. His testicular biopsy revealed incomplete 
maturation arrest in spermatogenesis; clinically we found mild memory impairment 
and hand tremor and MRI showed similar changes as his siblings. We consider 
CLCN2 c.607G > T pathogenic because of the neuroradiological and clinical 
findings, including azoospermia.
CONCLUSION: Considerable workup may be required to determine the pathogenicity 
of novel variants, and to unambiguously associate phenotype with genotype. In 
very rare disorders, highly specific clinical or biomarker combinations provide 
sufficient evidence for a variant's pathogenicity. Phenotypic variation of 
monogenic disorders described in the literature may be attributed to a second 
co-occurring monogenic disorder, especially in consanguineous families. SPG56 
may have reduced penetrance.
