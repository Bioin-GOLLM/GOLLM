In addition to commonly associated environmental factors, genomic factors may 
cause cerebral palsy. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 250 
parent-offspring trios, and observed enrichment of damaging de novo mutations in 
cerebral palsy cases. Eight genes had multiple damaging de novo mutations; of 
these, two (TUBA1A and CTNNB1) met genome-wide significance. We identified two 
novel monogenic etiologies, FBXO31 and RHOB, and showed that the RHOB mutation 
enhances active-state Rho effector binding while the FBXO31 mutation diminishes 
cyclin D levels. Candidate cerebral palsy risk genes overlapped with 
neurodevelopmental disorder genes. Network analyses identified enrichment of Rho 
GTPase, extracellular matrix, focal adhesion and cytoskeleton pathways. Cerebral 
palsy risk genes in enriched pathways were shown to regulate neuromotor function 
in a Drosophila reverse genetics screen. We estimate that 14% of cases could be 
attributed to an excess of damaging de novo or recessive variants. These 
findings provide evidence for genetically mediated dysregulation of early 
neuronal connectivity in cerebral palsy.
