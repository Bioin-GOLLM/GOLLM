The mechanism of degradation of cyclo(-Asn-Phe-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Gaba-) and 
the relative stabilities of this and other octapeptide somatostatin analogues in 
rat intestinal juice.

The mechanism of degradation of the somatostatin analogue 
cyclo(-Asn-Phe-4-[3H]-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Gaba-) in rat intestinal juice in 
vitro has been studied by isolation and identification of cleavage products. The 
analogue is much more stable than somatostatin but is nevertheless degraded in 
minutes in dilute intestinal juice. There is a single primary cleavage site at 
Lys-Thr and the linear peptide thus formed is subsequently rapidly degraded to 
smaller peptides. Analogues with a modified lysine are markedly stabilised 
relative to the octapeptide analogue.
