OBJECTIVE: We investigated the function of the Prep1 gene in insulin-dependent 
glucose homeostasis in liver.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prep1 action on insulin glucoregulatory function 
has been analyzed in liver of Prep1-hypomorphic mice (Prep1(i/i)), which express 
2-3% of Prep1 mRNA.
RESULTS: Based on euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies and measurement of 
glycogen content, livers from Prep1(i/i) mice feature increased sensitivity to 
insulin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of both insulin receptor (IR) and insulin 
receptor substrate (IRS)1/2 was significantly enhanced in Prep1(i/i) livers 
accompanied by a specific downregulation of the SYP and SHP1 tyrosine 
phosphatases. Prep1 overexpression in HepG2 liver cells upregulated SYP and SHP1 
and inhibited insulin-induced IR and IRS1/2 phosphorylation and was accompanied 
by reduced glycogen content. Consistently, overexpression of the Prep1 partner 
Pbx1, but not of p160MBP, mimicked Prep1 effects on tyrosine phosphorylations, 
glycogen content, and on SYP and SHP1 expression. In Prep1 overexpressing cells, 
antisense silencing of SHP1, but not that of SYP, rescued insulin-dependent IR 
phosphorylation and glycogen accumulation. Both Prep1 and Pbx1 bind SHP1 
promoter at a site located between nucleotides -2,113 and -1,778. This fragment 
features enhancer activity and induces luciferase function by 7-, 6-, and 
30-fold, respectively, in response to Prep1, Pbx1, or both.
CONCLUSIONS: SHP1, a known silencer of insulin signal, is a transcriptional 
target of Prep1. In liver, transcriptional activation of SHP1 gene by Prep1 
attenuates insulin signal transduction and reduces glucose storage.
