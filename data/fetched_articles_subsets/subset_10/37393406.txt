To recognize DNA adducts, nucleotide excision repair (NER) deploys the XPC 
sensor, which detects damage-induced helical distortions, followed by engagement 
of TFIIH for lesion verification. Accessory players ensure that this factor 
handover takes place in chromatin where DNA is tightly wrapped around histones. 
Here, we describe how the histone methyltransferase ASH1L, once activated by 
MRG15, helps XPC and TFIIH to navigate through chromatin and induce 
global-genome NER hotspots. Upon UV irradiation, ASH1L adds H3K4me3 all over the 
genome (except in active gene promoters), thus priming chromatin for XPC 
relocations from native to damaged DNA. The ASH1L-MRG15 complex further recruits 
the histone chaperone FACT to DNA lesions. In the absence of ASH1L, MRG15 or 
FACT, XPC is misplaced and persists on damaged DNA without being able to deliver 
the lesions to TFIIH. We conclude that ASH1L-MRG15 makes damage verifiable by 
the NER machinery through the sequential deposition of H3K4me3 and FACT.
