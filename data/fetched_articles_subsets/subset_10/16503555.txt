Prothrombin Suresnes: a case of homozygous F299V mutation responsible for 
hypodysprothrombinemia.

Fran√ßois D, Chevreaud C, Vignon D, de Mazancourt P.

A patient with a severe prothrombin deficiency and a hemorrhagic diathesis was 
found to have positive cross-reactive material in plasma and a homozygous F299V 
mutation (F7V in the A chain). This mutation reinforces the previous conclusion 
that the A chain affects the geometry of the catalytic triad. Marked 
prolongation of the Taipan venom and Russell venom clotting times also 
demonstrated a defective activation mechanism and a defective interaction with 
factor Xa.
