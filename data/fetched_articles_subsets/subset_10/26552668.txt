BACKGROUND: Adult Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an orphan disease. 
Chemotherapy is usually reserved to patients presenting with single system 
multifocal (SS-m) or multisystem (MS) disease but due to the lack of randomized 
studies no standard first line therapy has been defined yet. Pediatric regimens 
based on the vinblastine/prednisone backbone are not well tolerated in adults 
and probably less effective. We previously demonstrated high efficacy of the 
dose dense polichemotherapy regimen MACOP-B in 7 adult patients with SS-m or 
MS-LCH, in terms of high response rate and durable responses. Here we report an 
update of these data with the purpose of evaluating the long term efficacy of 
MACOP-B in adult LCH.
METHODS: Clinical data of all adult LCH patients (n = 17) diagnosed and treated 
at our Institution during the past 20-year period were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 11 patients (6 with SS-m and 5 with MS-LCH) were treated 
with MACOP-B from 1995 to 2014. The overall response rate was confirmed to be 
100 %, with a complete response of 73 % and a partial response rate of 27 %. 
Overall progression free survival was 64 %, and disease free survival after 
achievement of initial CR was 87 %. Overall survival rate was 82 % after 6.7 
years of median follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm high activity of MACOP-B in adult LCH, 
indicating that a substantial fraction of patients achieve long lasting 
responses and can be cured with this therapeutic approach.
