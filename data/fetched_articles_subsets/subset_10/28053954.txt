Cancer cells rewire their metabolism to satisfy the demands of growth and 
survival, and this metabolic reprogramming has been recognized as an emerging 
hallmark of cancer. Lipid metabolism is pivotal in cellular process that 
converts nutrients into energy, building blocks for membrane biogenesis and the 
generation of signaling molecules. Accumulating evidence suggests that cancer 
cells show alterations in different aspects of lipid metabolism. The changes in 
lipid metabolism of cancer cells can affect numerous cellular processes, 
including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The 
potential dependence of cancer cells on the deregulated lipid metabolism 
suggests that enzymes and regulating factors involved in this process are 
promising targets for cancer treatment. In this review, we focus on the features 
associated with the lipid metabolic pathways in cancer, and highlight recent 
advances on the therapeutic targets of specific lipid metabolic enzymes or 
regulating factors and target-directed small molecules that can be potentially 
used as anticancer drugs.
