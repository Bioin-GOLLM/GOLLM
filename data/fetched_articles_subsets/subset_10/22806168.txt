BACKGROUND: Heritable risk for breast cancer includes an increasing number of 
common, low effect risk variants. We conducted a multistage genetic association 
study in a series of independent epidemiologic breast cancer study populations 
to identify novel breast cancer risk variants.
METHODS: We tested 1,162 SNPs of greatest nominal significance from stage I of 
the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility breast cancer study (CGEMS; 1,145 
cases, 1,142 controls) for evidence of replicated association with breast cancer 
in the Nashville Breast Cohort (NBC; 599 cases, 1,161 controls), the 
Collaborative Breast Cancer Study (CBCS; 1,552 cases, 1,185 controls), and BioVU 
Breast Cancer Study (BioVU; 1,172 cases, 1,172 controls).
RESULTS: Among these SNPs, a series of validated breast cancer risk variants 
yielded expected associations in the study populations. In addition, we observed 
two previously unreported loci that were significantly associated with breast 
cancer risk in the CGEMS, NBC, and CBCS study populations and had a consistent, 
although not statistically significant, risk effect in the BioVU study 
population. These were rs1626678 at 10q25.3 near ENO4 and KIAA1598 
(meta-analysis age-adjusted OR = 1.13 [1.07-1.20], P = 5.6 × 10(-5)), and 
rs8046508 at 16q23.1 in the eighth intron of WWOX (meta-analysis age-adjusted OR 
= 1.20 [1.10-1.31], P = 3.5 × 10(-5)).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data supports the association of two novel loci, at 10q25.3 and 
16q23.1, with risk of breast cancer.
IMPACT: The expanding compendium of known breast cancer genetic risk variants 
holds increasing power for clinical risk prediction models of breast cancer, 
improving upon the Gail model.
