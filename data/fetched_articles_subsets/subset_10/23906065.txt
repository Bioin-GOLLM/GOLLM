Asymmetric cell division plays a crucial role in cell differentiation, unequal 
replicative senescence, and stem cell maintenance. In budding yeast, the 
identities of mother and daughter cells begin to diverge at bud emergence when 
distinct plasma-membrane domains are formed and separated by a septin ring. 
However, the mechanisms underlying this transformation remain unknown. Here, we 
show that septins recruited to the site of polarization by Cdc42-GTP inhibit 
Cdc42 activity in a negative feedback loop, and this inhibition depends on Cdc42 
GTPase-activating proteins. Combining live-cell imaging and computational 
modeling, we demonstrate that the septin ring is sculpted by polarized 
exocytosis, which creates a hole in the accumulating septin density and relieves 
the inhibition of Cdc42. The nascent ring generates a sharp boundary that 
confines the Cdc42 activity and exocytosis strictly to its enclosure and thus 
clearly delineates the daughter cell identity. Our findings define a fundamental 
mechanism underlying eukaryotic cell fate differentiation.
