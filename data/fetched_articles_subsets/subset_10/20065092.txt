Macroautophagy is a catabolic pathway used for the turnover of long-lived 
proteins and organelles in eukaryotic cells. The morphological hallmark of this 
process is the formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that sequester 
cytoplasm. Autophagosome formation is the most complex part of macroautophagy, 
and it is a dynamic event that likely involves vesicle fusion to expand the 
initial sequestering membrane, the phagophore; however, essentially nothing is 
known about this process including the molecular components involved in vesicle 
tethering and fusion. In this study, we provide evidence that the subunits of 
the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex are required for double-membrane 
cytoplasm to vacuole targeting vesicle and autophagosome formation. COG subunits 
localized to the phagophore assembly site and interacted with Atg (autophagy 
related) proteins. In addition, mutations in the COG genes resulted in the 
mislocalization of Atg8 and Atg9, which are critical components involved in 
autophagosome formation.
