Hb Anamosa or alpha 2(111)(G18)Ala-->Val beta 2 (alpha 2 mutation) and Hb 
Mulhacen or alpha 2(123)(H6)Ala-->Ser beta 2 (alpha 1 mutation) are two silent, 
stable variants detected by sequencing of amplified DNA.

We have identified silent amino acid substitutions in two alpha chain variants 
present in families from Iowa, USA, and Granada, Spain. Both involve an alanine 
residue in the core peptide, namely Ala-->Val at position 111 (codon change in 
the alpha 2 gene; GCC->GTC; Hb Anamosa) and Ala-->Ser at position 123 (codon 
change in the alpha 1 gene; GCC-->TCC; Hb Mulhacen). The two variants are 
stable. Sequencing of the amplified alpha 2- and alpha 1-globin genes greatly 
facilitated the characterization of the two variants.
