Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The risk of AD 
increases with age. Although two of the main pathological features of AD, 
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, were already recognized by Alois 
Alzheimer at the beginning of the 20th century, the pathogenesis of the disease 
remains unsettled. Therapeutic approaches targeting plaques or tangles have not 
yet resulted in satisfactory improvements in AD treatment. This may, in part, be 
due to early-onset and late-onset AD pathogenesis being underpinned by different 
mechanisms. Most animal models of AD are generated from gene mutations involved 
in early onset familial AD, accounting for only 1% of all cases, which may 
consequently complicate our understanding of AD mechanisms. In this article, the 
authors discuss the pathogenesis of AD according to the two main 
neuropathologies, including senescence-related mechanisms and possible 
treatments using stem cells, namely mesenchymal and neural stem cells.
