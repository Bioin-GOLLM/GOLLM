Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a membrane-bound homodimeric enzyme that in 
vivo controls content and biological activity of N-arachidonoylethanolamine 
(AEA) and other relevant bioactive lipids termed endocannabinoids. Parallel 
orientation of FAAH monomers likely allows both subunits to simultaneously 
recruit and cleave substrates. Here, we show full inhibition of human and rat 
FAAH by means of enzyme inhibitors used at a homodimer:inhibitor stoichiometric 
ratio of 1:1, implying that occupation of only one of the two active sites of 
FAAH is enough to fully block catalysis. Single W445Y substitution in rat FAAH 
displayed the same activity as the wild-type, but failed to show full inhibition 
at the homodimer:inhibitor 1:1 ratio. Instead, F432A mutant exhibited reduced 
specific activity but was fully inhibited at the homodimer:inhibitor 1:1 ratio. 
Kinetic analysis of AEA hydrolysis by rat FAAH and its F432A mutant demonstrated 
a Hill coefficient of ~1.6, that instead was ~1.0 in the W445Y mutant. Of note, 
also human FAAH catalysed an allosteric hydrolysis of AEA, showing a Hill 
coefficient of ~1.9. Taken together, this study demonstrates an unprecedented 
allosterism of FAAH, and represents a case of communication between two enzyme 
subunits seemingly controlled by a single amino acid (W445) at the dimer 
interface. In the light of extensive attempts and subsequent failures over the 
last decade to develop effective drugs for human therapy, these findings pave 
the way to the rationale design of new molecules that, by acting as positive or 
negative heterotropic effectors of FAAH, may control more efficiently its 
activity.
