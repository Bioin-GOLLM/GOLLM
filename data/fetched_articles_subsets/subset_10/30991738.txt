Kinesins play an important role in many physiological functions including 
intracellular vesicle transport and mitosis. The emerging role of kinesins in 
different cancers led us to investigate the expression and functional role of 
kinesins in meningioma. Therefore, we re-analyzed our previous microarray 
dataset of benign, atypical, and anaplastic meningiomas (n = 62) and got 
evidence for differential expression of five kinesins (KIFC1, KIF4A, KIF11, 
KIF14 and KIF20A). Further validation in an extended study sample (n = 208) 
revealed a significant upregulation of these genes in WHO°I to °III meningiomas 
(WHO°I n = 61, WHO°II n = 88, and WHO°III n = 59), which was most pronounced in 
clinically more aggressive tumors of the same WHO grade. Immunohistochemical 
staining confirmed a WHO grade-associated upregulated protein expression in 
meningioma tissues. Furthermore, high mRNA expression levels of KIFC1, KIF11, 
KIF14 and KIF20A were associated with shorter progression-free survival. On a 
functional level, knockdown of kinesins in Ben-Men-1 cells and in the newly 
established anaplastic meningioma cell line NCH93 resulted in a significantly 
inhibited tumor cell proliferation upon siRNA-mediated downregulation of KIF11 
in both cell lines by up to 95% and 71%, respectively. Taken together, in this 
study we were able to identify the prognostic and functional role of several 
kinesin family members of which KIF11 exhibits the most promising properties as 
a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target, which may offer new treatment 
options for aggressive meningiomas.
