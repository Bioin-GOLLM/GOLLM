INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies and 
has few treatment options. Saikosaponin D (SSD), a major bioactive triterpene 
saponin isolated from Bupleurum chinense, has been reported to exert 
cytotoxicity properties toward many cancer cells. However, the effects of SSD on 
pancreatic cancer have been little scrutinized.
METHODS: Here, we investigated the effect of SSD on the proliferation and 
apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer BxPC3 and PANC1 cells and the mouse 
pancreatic cancer cell line Pan02. Cell viability was determined by MTT assays 
and cell apoptosis analyzed by DAPI staining and flow cytometry. Expression 
levels of apoptosis-regulating markers and activity of the MKK4-JNK signaling 
pathway were determined by Western blotting. The inhibitor SP600125 was applied 
to confirm the role of the JNK pathway in SSD efficiency.
RESULTS: SSD significantly inhibited the proliferation of BxPC3, PANC1, and 
Pan02 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Flow-cytometry 
analysis indicated obvious apoptosis induction after SSD exposure. Furthermore, 
SSD significantly triggered cleavage of caspase 3 and caspase 9 proteins and 
increased the expression of FoxO3a. In addition, activity of the MKK4-JNK 
pathway was dramatically increased after treatment with SSD in BxPC3 cells. SSD 
obviously stimulated phosphorylation of JNK, cJun, and SEK1/MKK4 proteins within 
30 minutes. The addition of SP600125 blocked the activation of SSD on the 
MKK4-JNK regulatory pathway and reversed the effects of SSD on proliferation 
inhibition and apoptosis induction in BxPC3 cells.
CONCLUSION: These results revealed that SSD was capable of suppressing tumor 
growth and promoting apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells via targeting the 
MKK4-JNK signaling pathway, indicating the possibility of further developing SSD 
as a potential therapeutic candidate for pancreatic cancer.
