SOST encodes sclerostin, an inhibitor of bone formation that antagonizes 
canonical Wnt signaling. Variations of SOST expression have an impact on bone 
mineral density (BMD) and bone strength. We hypothesized that genetic and 
epigenetic DNA modifications have an impact on SOST gene expression. By 
analyzing 43 bone samples from women, we found that rs851054 (G/A) is associated 
with SOST mRNA expression, donors with one or two G allele(s) displaying higher 
SOST expression (p<0.05). Beside this polymorphism, we also investigated the 
role of CpG methylation in SOST mRNA expression, and analyzed methylation 
variation at 13 CpG sites on the 1st exon of SOST in 14 human bone samples. 
Principal component analysis identified three groups of CpG sites that explained 
most of the methylation variation. We calculated the percentage of methylation 
in the main group of CpGs, and showed that higher rates of methylated CpGs are 
associated with higher SOST mRNA expression. To demonstrate that change in SOST 
expression might be related to human bone disease, we analyzed 131 patients with 
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a rare disease characterized by low BMD, bone 
fragility, and marked intra-familial variability of bone phenotypes. We found an 
association between rs851054 of the SOST promoter and the fracture rate only 
during childhood (p<0.01). In conclusion, genetic and epigenetic changes 
contribute to variation in SOST expression in human bone. Our data also indicate 
that these variations may be related to the severity of OI.
