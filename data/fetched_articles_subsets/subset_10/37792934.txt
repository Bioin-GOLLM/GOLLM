Several genetically encoded sensors have been developed to study live cell 
NADPH/NADP+ dynamics, but their use has been predominantly in vitro. Here, we 
developed an in vivo assay using the Apollo-NADP+ sensor and microfluidic 
devices to measure endogenous NADPH/NADP+ dynamics in the pancreatic β cells of 
live zebrafish embryos. Flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, the main 
source of NADPH in many cell types, has been reported to be low in β cells. 
Thus, it is unclear how these cells compensate to meet NADPH demands. Using our 
assay, we show that pyruvate cycling is the main source of NADP+ reduction in β 
cells, with contributions from folate cycling after acute electrical activation. 
INS1E β cells also showed a stress-induced increase in folate cycling and 
further suggested that this cycling requires both increased glycolytic 
intermediates and cytosolic NAD+. Overall, we show in vivo application of the 
Apollo-NADP+ sensor and reveal that β cells are capable of adapting NADPH/NADP+ 
redox during stress.
