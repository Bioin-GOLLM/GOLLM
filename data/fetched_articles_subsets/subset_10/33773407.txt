In acute myeloid leukemia, t(8;21) detected with a frequency of 10% is 
associated with good prognosis. However, variant t(8;21) is observed in 4% of 
these cases, and although the prognostic effects of these variant translocations 
have not been clearly revealed, there are findings that they affect the 
prognosis poorly. Here, we report on a 39 years old man, detected 4-way varyant 
t(8;21) which include relocalization of RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion gene, and loss of Y 
chromosome. RT-PCR also confirmed RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion transcript. Additionally, 
D820G and N822K mutations on KIT gene and mut B on NMP1 gene were detected. A 
complete remission could not achieved after first chemotherapy treatment. Due to 
primary resistance and variant of t(8;21), stem cell transplantation was 
performed. The variant translocation we have reported is unique and also the 
case is the second case that was reported in the literature in terms of the 
relocation of the AML1/ETO fusion gene. Since c-KIT mutations and LOY were also 
observed, it is not possible to predict the prognosis. To highlight the 
importance of variant translocations and relocalization of fusion gene, more 
cytogenetic and molecular data are needed.
