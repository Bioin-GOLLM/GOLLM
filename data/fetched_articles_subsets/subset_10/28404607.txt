BACKGROUND: The rapid expansion of genetic testing has led to increased 
utilization of clinical whole-exome sequencing (WES). Clinicians and genetic 
researchers are being faced with assessing risk of disease vulnerability from 
incidentally identified genetic variants which is typified by variants found in 
genes associated with sudden death-predisposing catecholaminergic polymorphic 
ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). We sought to determine whether incidentally 
identified variants in genes associated with CPVT from WES clinical testing 
represent disease-associated biomarkers.
METHODS AND RESULTS: CPVT-associated genes RYR2 and CASQ2 variants were 
identified in one of the world's largest collections of clinical WES referral 
tests (N=6517, Baylor Miraca Genetics Laboratories) and compared with a control 
cohort of ostensibly healthy individuals (N=60 706) and a case cohort of CPVT 
cases (N=155). Within the WES cohort, the rate of rare variants in 
CPVT-associated genes was 8.8% compared with 6.0% among controls and 60.0% among 
cases. There was a predominance of variants of undetermined significance 
(97.7%). After protein topology mapping, WES variants colocalized more 
frequently to residues with variants found in controls compared with cases. 
Retrospective clinical evaluation of individuals referred to our institution 
with WES-positive variants demonstrated no evidence of clinical CPVT in 
individuals with a low pretest clinical suspicion for CPVT.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of incidentally identified CPVT-associated variants 
is ≈9% among WES tests. Variants of undetermined significances in 
CPVT-associated genes in WES genetic testing, in the absence of clinical 
suspicion for CPVT, are unlikely to represent markers of CPVT pathogenicity.
