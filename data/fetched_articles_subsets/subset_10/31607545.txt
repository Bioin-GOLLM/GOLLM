The CRISPR effector Cas13 could be an effective antiviral for single-stranded 
RNA (ssRNA) viruses because it programmably cleaves RNAs complementary to its 
CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Here, we computationally identify thousands of potential 
Cas13 crRNA target sites in hundreds of ssRNA viral species that can potentially 
infect humans. We experimentally demonstrate Cas13's potent activity against 
three distinct ssRNA viruses: lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV); 
influenza A virus (IAV); and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Combining this 
antiviral activity with Cas13-based diagnostics, we develop Cas13-assisted 
restriction of viral expression and readout (CARVER), an end-to-end platform 
that uses Cas13 to detect and destroy viral RNA. We further screen hundreds of 
crRNAs along the LCMV genome to evaluate how conservation and target RNA 
nucleotide content influence Cas13's antiviral activity. Our results demonstrate 
that Cas13 can be harnessed to target a wide range of ssRNA viruses and CARVER's 
potential broad utility for rapid diagnostic and antiviral drug development.
