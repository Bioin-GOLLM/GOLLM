Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and myeloid differentiation primary response protein 
88 (MYD88) gene polymorphisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's 
lymphoma (HL) through altered immunoregulatory and inflammatory responses. A 
candidate-gene association study was conducted to investigate the association 
between TLR9 -1237T>C, TLR9 2848A>G, MYD88 -938C>A and MYD88 1944C>G gene 
polymorphisms and the risk for HL. The impact of haplotypes was also examined. 
The study showed that carriership for -1237C and 2848A was associated with an 
increased risk for HL (odds ratio (OR)=2.53 (1.36-4.71) and OR=6.20 (1.3-28.8)). 
The MYD88 polymorphisms produced nonsignificant results. The estimated 
frequencies of the TLR9/1237C-2848A and MYD88/938C-1944G haplotypes were also 
significantly different between HL and controls (P<0.01). In addition, a 
significant difference between HL and controls was observed for the 
TLR9/1237C-TLR9/2848A-MYD88/938C-MYD88/1944C haplotypes (P<0.01). In conclusion, 
our study showed that TLR polymorphisms, and TLR9 and MYD88 haplotypes are 
related to the development of HL.
