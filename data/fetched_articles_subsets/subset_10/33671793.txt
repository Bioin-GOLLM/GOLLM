Flight dispersal represents a key aspect of the evolutionary and ecological 
success of insects, allowing escape from predators, mating, and colonization of 
new niches. The huge energy demand posed by flight activity is essentially met 
by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in flight muscle mitochondria. In insects, 
mitochondrial ATP supply and oxidant production are regulated by several 
factors, including the energy demand exerted by changes in adenylate balance. 
Indeed, adenylate directly regulates OXPHOS by targeting both chemiosmotic ATP 
production and the activities of specific mitochondrial enzymes. In several 
organisms, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is regulated at transcriptional, 
post-translational, and allosteric levels, impacting mitochondrial energy 
metabolism, and redox balance. This review will present the concepts on how COX 
function contributes to flying insect biology, focusing on the existing examples 
in the literature where its structure and activity are regulated not only by 
physiological and environmental factors but also how changes in its activity 
impacts insect biology. We also performed in silico sequence analyses and 
determined the structure models of three COX subunits (IV, VIa, and VIc) from 
different insect species to compare with mammalian orthologs. We observed that 
the sequences and structure models of COXIV, COXVIa, and COXVIc were quite 
similar to their mammalian counterparts. Remarkably, specific substitutions to 
phosphomimetic amino acids at critical phosphorylation sites emerge as hallmarks 
on insect COX sequences, suggesting a new regulatory mechanism of COX activity. 
Therefore, by providing a physiological and bioenergetic framework of COX 
regulation in such metabolically extreme models, we hope to expand the knowledge 
of this critical enzyme complex and the potential consequences for insect 
dispersal.
