Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease caused by 
degeneration of motor neurons. As with all major neurodegenerative disorders, 
development of disease-modifying therapies has proven challenging for multiple 
reasons. Nevertheless, ALS is one of the few neurodegenerative diseases for 
which disease-modifying therapies are approved. Significant discoveries and 
advances have been made in ALS preclinical models, genetics, pathology, 
biomarkers, imaging and clinical readouts over the last 10-15 years. At the same 
time, novel therapeutic paradigms are being applied in areas of high unmet 
medical need, including neurodegenerative disorders. These developments have 
evolved our knowledge base, allowing identification of targeted candidate 
therapies for ALS with diverse mechanisms of action. In this Review, we discuss 
how this advanced knowledge, aligned with new approaches, can enable effective 
translation of therapeutic agents from preclinical studies through to clinical 
benefit for patients with ALS. We anticipate that this approach in ALS will also 
positively impact the field of drug discovery for neurodegenerative disorders 
more broadly.
