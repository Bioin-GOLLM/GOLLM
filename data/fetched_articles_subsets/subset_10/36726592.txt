Environmental pollution, accounting for both chemical and physical factors, is a 
major matter of concern due to its health consequences in both humans and 
animals. The release of greenhouse gases with the consequent increase in 
environmental temperature is acknowledged to have a major impact on the health 
of both animals and humans, in current and future generations. A large amount of 
evidence reports detrimental effects of acute heat stress on testis function, 
particularly on the spermatogenetic and steroidogenetic process, in both animal 
and human models, wich is largely related to the testis placement within the 
scrotal sac and outside the abdomen, warranting an overall scrotal temperature 
of 2°C-4°C lower than the core body temperature. This review will provide a 
thorough evaluation of environmental temperature's effect on testicular 
function. In particular, basic concepts of body thermoregulation will be 
discussed together with available data about the association between testis 
damage and heat stress exposure. In addition, the possible association between 
global warming and the secular decline of testis function will be critically 
evaluated in light of the available epidemiological studies.
