Obesity is associated with white adipose tissue (WAT) hypoxia and inflammation. 
We aimed to test whether mild environmental oxygen restriction (OxR, 13% O2), 
imposing tissue hypoxia, triggers WAT inflammation in obese mice. Thirteen weeks 
diet-induced obese male adult C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice housed at thermoneutrality 
were exposed for five days to OxR versus normoxia. WAT and blood were isolated 
and used for analysis of metabolites and adipokines, WAT histology and 
macrophage staining, and WAT transcriptomics. OxR increased circulating levels 
of haemoglobin and haematocrit as well as hypoxia responsive transcripts in WAT 
and decreased blood glucose, indicating systemic and tissue hypoxia. WAT 
aconitase activity was inhibited. Macrophage infiltration as marker for WAT 
inflammation tended to be decreased, which was supported by down regulation of 
inflammatory genes S100a8, Ccl8, Clec9a, Saa3, Mgst2, and Saa1. Other down 
regulated processes include cytoskeleton remodelling and metabolism, while 
response to hypoxia appeared most prominently up regulated. The adipokines 
coiled-coil domain containing 3 (CCDC3) and adiponectin, as well as the putative 
WAT hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), were reduced by OxR on transcript (Cck, 
Ccdc3) and/or serum protein level (adiponectin, CCDC3). Conclusively, our data 
demonstrate that also in obese mice OxR does not trigger WAT inflammation. 
However, OxR does evoke a metabolic response in WAT, with CCDC3 and adiponectin 
as potential markers for systemic or WAT hypoxia.
