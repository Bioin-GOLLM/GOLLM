The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central controller of cell growth 
and is currently being investigated as a potential target in breast cancer 
therapy. The essential amino acid leucine has been proposed to regulate mTOR 
signaling. The objective of this study was to determine whether leucine 
restriction would inhibit mTOR signaling in breast cancer cells. Leucine 
restriction did not decrease mTOR signaling in any of the 8 breast cancer cell 
lines tested. In addition, in vivo administration of a leucine-free diet for up 
to 4 days did not result in a decrease in phosphorylation of mTOR target 
proteins in breast cancer xenografts. Further, in 3 different cell lines, an 
increase in Akt phosphorylation was observed after leucine restriction. This was 
observed without a decrease in S6K phosphorylation, suggesting a mechanism 
different from the feedback loop activation of Akt observed with rapamycin 
treatment. We conclude that leucine restriction is not sufficient to inhibit 
mTOR signaling in most breast cancer cell lines but is associated with 
activation of survival molecule Akt, making leucine deprivation an undesirable 
approach for breast cancer therapy.
