Intracellular proteins tagged with ubiquitin chains are targeted to the 26S 
proteasome for degradation. The two subunits, Rpn10 and Rpn13, function as 
ubiquitin receptors of the proteasome. However, differences in roles between 
Rpn10 and Rpn13 in mammals remains to be understood. We analyzed mice deficient 
for Rpn13 and Rpn10. Liver-specific deletion of either Rpn10 or Rpn13 showed 
only modest impairment, but simultaneous loss of both caused severe liver injury 
accompanied by massive accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates, which was recovered 
by re-expression of either Rpn10 or Rpn13. We also found that mHR23B and 
ubiquilin/Plic-1 and -4 failed to bind to the proteasome in the absence of both 
Rpn10 and Rpn13, suggesting that these two subunits are the main receptors for 
these UBL-UBA proteins that deliver ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. 
Our results indicate that Rpn13 mostly plays a redundant role with Rpn10 in 
recognition of ubiquitinated proteins and maintaining homeostasis in Mus 
musculus.
