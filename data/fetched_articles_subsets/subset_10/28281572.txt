Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) describes a group of neurodevelopmental disorders 
with high heritability, although the underlying genetic determinants of ASDs 
remain largely unknown. Large-scale whole-genome studies of copy number 
variation in Han Chinese samples are still lacking. We performed a genome-wide 
copy number variation analysis of 343 ASD trios, 203 patients with sporadic 
cases and 988 controls in a Chinese population using Illumina genotyping 
platforms to identify CNVs and related genes that may contribute to ASD risk. We 
identified 32 rare CNVs larger than 1â€‰Mb in 31 patients. ASD patients were found 
to carry a higher global burden of rare, large CNVs than controls. Recurrent de 
novo or case-private CNVs were found at 15q11-13, Xp22.3, 15q13.1-13.2, 3p26.3 
and 2p12. The de novo 15q11-13 duplication was more prevalent in this Chinese 
population than in those with European ancestry. Several genes, including GRAMD2 
and STAM, were implicated as novel ASD risk genes when integrating whole-genome 
CNVs and whole-exome sequencing data. We also identified several CNVs that 
include known ASD genes (SHANK3, CDH10, CSMD1) or genes involved in nervous 
system development (NYAP2, ST6GAL2, GRM6). Besides, our study also implicated 
Contactins-NYAPs-WAVE1 pathway in ASD pathogenesis. Our findings identify 
ASD-related CNVs in a Chinese population and implicate novel ASD risk genes and 
related pathway for further study.
