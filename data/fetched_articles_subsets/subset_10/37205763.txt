Sialic acids linked to glycoproteins and glycolipids are important mediators of 
cell and protein recognition events. These sugar residues are removed by 
neuraminidases (sialidases). Neuraminidase-1 (sialidase-1 or NEU1) is a 
ubiquitously expressed mammalian sialidase located in lysosomes and on the cell 
membrane. Because of its modulation of multiple signaling processes, it is a 
potential therapeutic target for cancers and immune disorders. Genetic defects 
in NEU1 or in its protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA, CTSA) cause the 
lysosomal storage diseases sialidosis and galactosialidosis. To further our 
understanding of this enzyme's function at the molecular level, we determined 
the three-dimensional structure of murine NEU1. The enzyme oligomerizes through 
two self-association interfaces and displays a wide substrate-binding cavity. A 
catalytic loop adopts an inactive conformation. We propose a mechanism of 
activation involving a conformational change in this loop upon binding to its 
protective protein. These findings may facilitate the development of selective 
inhibitor and agonist therapies.
