Mesenchymal stem cells, which are poorly immunogenic and have potent 
immunosuppressive activities, have emerged as promising cellular therapeutics 
for the treatment of several diseases. Mesenchymal-like cells derived from 
Wharton's Jelly, called umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs), reportedly 
secrete a variety of cytokines and growth factors, acting as trophic suppliers. 
Here, we used UCMSCs to treat premature ovarian failure (POF). Ovarian function 
was evaluated by ovulation and the number of follicles. Apoptosis of the 
granulosa cells (GC) was analyzed by TUNEL staining. We found that after 
transplantation of the UCMSCs, apoptosis of cumulus cells in the ovarian damage 
model was reduced and the function of the ovary had been recovered. The sex 
hormone level was significantly elevated in mice treated with UCMSCs. The number 
of follicles in the treated group was higher than in the control group. Our 
results demonstrate that UCMSCs can effectively restore ovary functionality and 
reduce apoptosis of granulosa cells. We compared the RNA expression of the 
UCMSCs treated group with the POF model and wild-type control group and found 
that the UCMSC group is most similar to the wild-type group. Our experiments 
provide new information regarding the treatment of ovarian function failure.
