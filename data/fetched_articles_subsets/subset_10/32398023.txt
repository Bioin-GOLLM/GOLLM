BACKGROUND: STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) is a type 
1 interferonopathy manifesting as a pulmonary and vascular syndrome resulting 
from gain-of-function mutations in TMEM173, the gene encoding STING. Familial 
reports in the literature are sparse.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case series of SAVI in a three generation 
kindred, with a phenotype of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and rheumatoid 
factor positive polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Current and 
historical medical records were reviewed for clinical and laboratory 
information. Whole blood from cases 1 and 2, plus stored appendicectomy tissue 
from case 3, underwent DNA sequencing of the TMEM173 gene. Peripheral blood RNA 
was obtained from cases 1 and 2 for functional assessment of the TMEM173 
mutation. DNA sequencing identified the same heterozygous TMEM173 mutation 
(c.463G > A; p.Val155Met) in all three cases, consistent with a diagnosis of the 
autosomal dominant condition SAVI. Functional assessment of this mutation 
identified a prominent interferon signature which was confirmed on repeat 
testing.
CONCLUSIONS: SAVI presented in this family as ILD with early onset juvenile 
rheumatoid arthritis. This condition should be considered in all rheumatoid 
arthritis patients with early-onset ILD and in all JIA patients with ILD.
