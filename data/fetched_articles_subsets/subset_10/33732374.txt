Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a malignant tumour of the human digestive system that 
has a poor prognosis. Exosomes contain proteins and nucleic acids, and 
constitute a class of extracellular vesicles defined as membrane-bound 
nanovesicles of endocytic origin, with a diameter of 40-150 nm. Exosomes are 
potential diagnostic markers of PC; however, their roles in cancer initiation 
and progression remain unclear. Previous studies have focused on the molecular 
mechanisms and functions of exosomes that allow them to accelerate PC cell 
proliferation, migration and invasion. The present review discusses the 
interactions between exosomes and the pathophysiology of PC. The potential 
clinical applications of exosomes are also discussed.
