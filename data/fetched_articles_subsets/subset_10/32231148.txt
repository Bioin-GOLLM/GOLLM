Several studies have shown that brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor 
nuclear translocator-like 1 (BMAL1), an important molecule for maintaining 
circadian rhythms, inhibits the growth and metastasis of tumor cells in several 
types of cancer, including lung, colon, and breast cancer. However, its role in 
glioblastoma has not yet been established. Here, we addressed the function of 
BMAL1 in U87MG glioblastoma cells with two approaches-loss and gain of function. 
In the loss of function experiments, cell proliferation in U87MG cells 
transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting BMAL1 was increased by 
approximately 24% (small interfering (si)-NC 0.91 ± 0.00 vs. si-BMAL1 1.129 ± 
0.08) via upregulation of cyclin B1. In addition, cell migration and invasion of 
BMAL1 siRNA-treated glioblastoma cells were elevated by approximately 20% (si-NC 
51.00 ± 1.53 vs. si-BMAL161.33 ± 0.88) and 209% (si-NC 21.28 ± 1.37 vs. si-BMAL1 
44.47 ± 3.48), respectively, through the accumulation of phosphorylated-AKT 
(p-AKT) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. Gain of function experiments 
revealed that adenovirus-mediated ectopic expression of BMAL1 in U87MG cells 
resulted in a 19% (Adenovirus (Ad)-vector 0.94± 0.03 vs. Ad-BMAL1 0.76 ± 0.03) 
decrease in cell proliferation compared with the control via downregulation of 
cyclin B1 and increased early and late apoptosis due to changes in the levels of 
BCL2-associated X protein (BAX), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and cleaved 
caspase-3. Likewise, cell migration and invasion were attenuated by 
approximately 24% (Ad-vector 55.00 ± 0.00 vs. Ad-BMAL1 41.83 ± 2.90) and 49% 
(Ad-vector 70.01 ± 1.24 vs. Ad-BMAL1 35.55 ± 1.78), respectively, in 
BMAL1-overexpressing U87MG cells following downregulation of p-AKT and MMP-9. 
Taken together, our results suggest that BMAL1 acts as an anti-cancer gene by 
altering the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioblastoma cells. 
Therefore, the BMAL1 gene could be a potential therapeutic target in the 
treatment of glioblastoma.
