OBJECTIVE: Optimism and resilience promote health and well-being in older 
adults, and previous reports suggest that these traits are heritable. We 
examined the association of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 
optimism and resilience in older adults.
DESIGN: Candidate gene association study that was a follow-on at the University 
of California, San Diego, sites of two NIH-funded multi-site longitudinal 
investigations: Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and SELenium and vitamin E 
Cancer prevention Trial (SELECT).
PARTICIPANTS: 426 women from WHI older than age 50 years, and 509 men older than 
age 55 years (age 50 years for African American men) from SELECT.
MEASUREMENTS: 65 candidate gene SNPs that were judged by consensus, based on a 
literature review, as being related to predisposition to optimism and 
resilience, and 31 ancestry informative marker SNPs, genotyped from blood-based 
DNA samples and self-report scales for trait optimism, resilience, and 
depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: Using a Bonferroni threshold for significant association (p = 0.00089), 
there were no significant associations for individual SNPs with optimism or 
resilience in single-locus analyses. Exploratory multi-locus polygenic analyses 
with p <0.05 showed an association of optimism with SNPs in MAOA, IL10, and FGG 
genes, and an association of resilience with a SNP in MAOA gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Correcting for Type I errors, there were no significant 
associations of optimism and resilience with specific gene SNPs in single-locus 
analyses. Positive psychological traits are likely to be genetically complex, 
with many loci having small effects contributing to phenotypic variation. Our 
exploratory multi-locus polygenic analyses suggest that larger sample sizes and 
complementary approaches involving methods such as sequence-based association 
studies, copy number variation analyses, and pathway-based analyses could be 
useful for better understanding the genetic basis of these positive 
psychological traits.
