Pyrvinium pamoate (PP) is an FDA-approved classical anthelmintic, but is now 
attracting particular attention as an anti-cancer drug after recent findings of 
its potent cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines only during glucose 
starvation, as well as its anti-tumor activity against hypovascular pancreatic 
cancer cells transplanted in mice. The molecular mechanisms by which PP promotes 
such preferential toxicity against cancer cells are currently under extensive 
investigation. PP suppressed the NADH-fumarate reductase system that mediates a 
reverse reaction of the mitochondrial electron-transport chain complex II in 
anaerobic organisms such as parasitic helminthes or mammalian cells under tumor 
microenvironment-mimicking hypoglycemic/hypoxic conditions, thereby inhibiting 
efficient ATP production. PP also inhibited the unfolded protein response 
induced by glucose starvation, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of 
pancreatic cancer cells. Even under normoglycemic/normoxic conditions, PP 
suppressed the mitochondrial electron-transport chain complex I and thereby 
STAT3, inhibiting the proliferation of myeloma/erythroleukemia cells. Here, we 
review accumulating knowledge on its working mechanisms and evaluate PP as a 
novel anti-cancer drug that targets mitochondrial respiration.
