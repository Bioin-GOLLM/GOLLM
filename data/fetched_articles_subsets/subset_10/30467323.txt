preceding primary.

This study aimed to understand the biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
that arises in the remnant pancreas after surgical resection of a primary 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, using integrated histological and molecular 
analysis. Patients who underwent a completion pancreatectomy for local 
recurrence following resection of a primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
were studied with histological analysis and next-generation sequencing of the 
primary and the recurrent cancer. Of six patients that met the inclusion 
criteria, three cases were classified as "true" recurrences, i.e., the primary 
and the cancer in the remnant pancreas shared both morphological features and 
molecular alterations. Two cases were identified as having independent cancers 
that exhibited different histological and molecular profiles. In the remaining 
case, the relationship could not be determined. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
that arises in the remnant pancreas can be either a second primary or a "true" 
relapse of the preceding primary. The differentiation of second primaries from 
local recurrences may have important implications for patient management.
