An individual's neurodevelopmental and cognitive sequelae to negative early 
experiences may, in part, be explained by genetic susceptibility. We examined 
whether extreme differences in the early caregiving environment, defined as 
exposure to severe psychosocial deprivation associated with institutional care 
compared to normative rearing, interacted with a biologically informed genoset 
comprising BDNF (rs6265), COMT (rs4680), and SIRT1 (rs3758391) to predict 
distinct outcomes of neurodevelopment at age 8 (N = 193, 97 males and 96 
females). Ethnicity was categorized as Romanian (71%), Roma (21%), unknown (7%), 
or other (1%). We identified a significant interaction between early caregiving 
environment (i.e., institutionalized versus never institutionalized children) 
and the a priori defined genoset for full-scale IQ, two spatial working memory 
tasks, and prefrontal cortex gray matter volume. Model validation was performed 
using a bootstrap resampling procedure. Although we hypothesized that the effect 
of this genoset would operate in a manner consistent with differential 
susceptibility, our results demonstrate a complex interaction where vantage 
susceptibility, diathesis stress, and differential susceptibility are 
implicated.
