The non-coding variation in the second intron of the L-myc gene, generating an 
EcoRI polymorphism, is associated with lung cancer risk and prognosis. We 
carried out sequence analysis of the L-myc gene in lung adenocarcinoma (ADCA) 
patients to identify functional polymorphisms and identified a new single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the third exon of the gene causing a Ser362Thr 
conservative amino acid change in the C-terminus of the encoded protein. This 
polymorphism showed significant linkage disequilibrium with the L-myc EcoRI 
polymorphism located at 1751 bp distance. Genotyping of the Ser362Thr SNP in 220 
Italian ADCA patients and in 230 general population controls revealed a similar 
low frequency (0.10-0.11) of the Thr allele in both groups. The multivariate 
odds ratio was 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-1.22). In the ADCA 
patients, no significant association between the Ser/Thr polymorphism and 
survival was observed. Thus, the present results do not support candidacy of the 
L-myc Ser362Thr polymorphism for the functional polymorphism of the L-myc 
genomic region.
