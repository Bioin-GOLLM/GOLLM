BACKGROUND: Periodontal ligament (PDL) cells, connecting root cementum with 
alveolar bone, are important for periodontal wound healing. In order to obtain a 
predictable periodontal regeneration, selective adhesion and proliferation of 
PDL cells are essential. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
effects of synthetic peptides mimicking cell-binding domain of fibronectin (FN) 
on human PDL cells.
METHODS: Two types of oligopeptides, 
Gly3-Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn-Gly6-Arg-Gly-Asp-Gly (G3PHSRNG6RGDG) and 
Gly3-His-Pro-Asn-Arg-Ser-Gly6-Arg-Gly-Asp-Gly (G3HPNRSG6RGDG), were constructed 
using a solid-phase peptide synthesizer. Fibronectin type III ninth to tenth 
domain (FN III 9-10) and Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) were prepared for comparison 
with the effects of synthetic peptides. These peptides were coated onto 96-well 
cell culture plates with 0.001 approximately 100 microM concentrations. Cultured 
human PDL cells were then applied to the peptide-coated wells at a density of 1 
x 10(4)/well. After 1 hour incubation at 37 degrees C, adhered cells were fixed, 
stained, and examined by phase contrast microscopy for cell spreading assay. 
Attached PDL cells were solubilized with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for the 
cell attachment assay by measuring absorbance at 595 nm in microplate reader. 
Western blot analysis was performed to determine extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK1/2) activity.
RESULTS: Cell attachment and spreading assays revealed that G3PHSRNG6RGDG (> or 
= 10 microM) possesses similar adhesive behavior to FN III 9-10. G3PHSRNG6RGDG 
showed a comparable ERK1/2 activity when compared to FN III 9-10.
CONCLUSIONS: G3PHSRNG6RGDG enhanced an attachment and spreading of human PDL 
cells thereby increasing ERK1/2 activity. Taken together, it is anticipated that 
this peptide might be a potential tool for arranging a biologically attractive 
environment for PDL cells, which would enhance periodontal regeneration 
efficacy.
