Regulatory T (Treg) cells are required to control immune responses and maintain 
homeostasis, but are a significant barrier to antitumour immunity1. Conversely, 
Treg instability, characterized by loss of the master transcription factor Foxp3 
and acquisition of proinflammatory properties2, can promote autoimmunity and/or 
facilitate more effective tumour immunity3,4. A comprehensive understanding of 
the pathways that regulate Foxp3 could lead to more effective Treg therapies for 
autoimmune disease and cancer. The availability of new functional genetic tools 
has enabled the possibility of systematic dissection of the gene regulatory 
programs that modulate Foxp3 expression. Here we developed a CRISPR-based pooled 
screening platform for phenotypes in primary mouse Treg cells and applied this 
technology to perform a targeted loss-of-function screen of around 500 nuclear 
factors to identify gene regulatory programs that promote or disrupt Foxp3 
expression. We identified several modulators of Foxp3 expression, including 
ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (Usp22) and ring finger protein 20 (Rnf20). 
Usp22, a member of the deubiquitination module of the SAGA chromatin-modifying 
complex, was revealed to be a positive regulator that stabilized Foxp3 
expression; whereas the screen suggested that Rnf20, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, can 
serve as a negative regulator of Foxp3. Treg-specific ablation of Usp22 in mice 
reduced Foxp3 protein levels and caused defects in their suppressive function 
that led to spontaneous autoimmunity but protected against tumour growth in 
multiple cancer models. Foxp3 destabilization in Usp22-deficient Treg cells 
could be rescued by ablation of Rnf20, revealing a reciprocal ubiquitin switch 
in Treg cells. These results reveal previously unknown modulators of Foxp3 and 
demonstrate a screening method that can be broadly applied to discover new 
targets for Treg immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune disease.
