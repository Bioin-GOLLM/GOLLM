Lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of diseases that often require their 
metabolism program to fulfill the demand of cell proliferation. Features of 
metabolism in lymphoma cells include high glucose uptake, deregulated expression 
of enzymes related to glycolysis, dual capacity for glycolytic and oxidative 
metabolism, elevated glutamine metabolism, and fatty acid synthesis. These 
aberrant metabolic changes lead to tumorigenesis, disease progression, and 
resistance to lymphoma chemotherapy. This metabolic reprogramming, including 
glucose, nucleic acid, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism, is a dynamic 
process caused not only by genetic and epigenetic changes, but also by changes 
in the microenvironment affected by viral infections. Notably, some critical 
metabolic enzymes and metabolites may play vital roles in lymphomagenesis and 
progression. Recent studies have uncovered that metabolic pathways might have 
clinical impacts on the diagnosis, characterization, and treatment of lymphoma 
subtypes. However, determining the clinical relevance of biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets related to lymphoma metabolism is still challenging. In this 
review, we systematically summarize current studies on metabolism reprogramming 
in lymphoma, and we mainly focus on disorders of glucose, amino acids, and lipid 
metabolisms, as well as dysregulation of molecules in metabolic pathways, 
oncometabolites, and potential metabolic biomarkers. We then discuss strategies 
directly or indirectly for those potential therapeutic targets. Finally, we 
prospect the future directions of lymphoma treatment on metabolic reprogramming.
