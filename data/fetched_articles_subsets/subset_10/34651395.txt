Multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are chronic conditions that 
result from dysfunction of the immune system. Their common root in autoimmunity 
stimulates interest in the exploration of similarities and differences between 
the two diseases. Genetic susceptibility is relevant, creating a substrate, on 
which environmental factors act as a trigger of an aberrant immune response. 
Despite being both T-cell mediated disorders with a strong involvement of the 
humoral arm, immunomodulation is a mainstay of MS management, whereas hormone 
replacement therapy remains the principal approach for T1D. T1D is usually 
diagnosed in children and adolescents, while MS is typical of young adults. This 
difference has implications for disease progression and treatment. The 
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its effect on immunity may affect the prevalence of 
these conditions, as well as their clinical manifestation.
