Mutations in several genes encoding components of the SWI/SNF chromatin 
remodeling complex cause neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we report on 
five individuals with mutations in SMARCD1; the individuals present with 
developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, 
and small hands and feet. Trio exome sequencing proved the mutations to be de 
novo in four of the five individuals. Mutations in other SWI/SNF components 
cause Coffin-Siris syndrome, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, or other syndromic 
and non-syndromic NDDs. Although the individuals presented here have 
dysmorphisms and some clinical overlap with these syndromes, they lack their 
typical facial dysmorphisms. To gain insight into the function of SMARCD1 in 
neurons, we investigated the Drosophila ortholog Bap60 in postmitotic 
memory-forming neurons of the adult Drosophila mushroom body (MB). Targeted 
knockdown of Bap60 in the MB of adult flies causes defects in long-term memory. 
Mushroom-body-specific transcriptome analysis revealed that Bap60 is required 
for context-dependent expression of genes involved in neuron function and 
development in juvenile flies when synaptic connections are actively being 
formed in response to experience. Taken together, we identify an NDD caused by 
SMARCD1 mutations and establish a role for the SMARCD1 ortholog Bap60 in the 
regulation of neurodevelopmental genes during a critical time window of juvenile 
adult brain development when neuronal circuits that are required for learning 
and memory are formed.
