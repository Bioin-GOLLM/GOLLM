The activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is triggered by calmodulin (CaM) 
binding and is often further regulated by phosphorylation at several positions 
in the enzyme. Phosphorylation at Ser1179 occurs in response to diverse 
physiologic stimuli and increases the NO synthesis and cytochrome c reductase 
activities of eNOS, thereby enhancing its participation in biological signal 
cascades. Despite its importance, the mechanism by which Ser1179 phosphorylation 
increases eNOS activity is not understood. To address this, we used stopped-flow 
spectroscopy and computer modeling approaches to determine how the 
phosphomimetic mutation (S1179D) may impact electron flux through eNOS and the 
conformational behaviors of its reductase domain, both in the absence and 
presence of bound CaM. We found that S1179D substitution in CaM-free eNOS had 
multiple effects; it increased the rate of flavin reduction, altered the 
conformational equilibrium of the reductase domain, and increased the rate of 
its conformational transitions. We found these changes were equivalent in degree 
to those caused by CaM binding to wild-type eNOS, and the S1179D substitution 
together with CaM binding caused even greater changes in these parameters. The 
modeling indicated that the changes caused by the S1179D substitution, despite 
being restricted to the reductase domain, are sufficient to explain the 
stimulation of both the cytochrome c reductase and NO synthase activities of 
eNOS. This helps clarify how Ser1179 phosphorylation regulates eNOS and provides 
a foundation to compare its regulation by other phosphorylation events.
