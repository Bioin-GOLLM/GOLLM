Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with 
typically extensive intraperitoneal implantation leading to poor prognosis. Our 
previous study preliminarily demonstrated β-hCG can promote tumorigenesis in 
immortalized nontumorigenic ovarian epithelial cells. In this study, the roles 
and mechanisms of β-hCG in regulating EOC proliferation and metastasis were 
thoroughly explored. First, histologically, β-hCG was aberrantly overexpressed 
in human EOC metastatic tissues, and significantly correlated with FIGO stage, 
tumor size, differentiation, histologic grade and high grade serous ovarian 
carcinoma (HGSOC) (P < 0.05). However, serologically, β-hCG expression showed no 
significant difference between EOC and nonmalignant ovarian patients. Second, 
β-hCG was confirmed to have no significant effects on EOC proliferation in vitro 
and in vivo, while β-hCG upregulation was proven to promote migration and 
invasion ability in ES-2 and OVCAR-3 cells in vitro (P < 0.05), and β-hCG 
downregulation in SKOV3 cells had the opposite effect. Moreover, more 
invadopodia protrusions, mitochondria accumulations and cytoskeletal 
rearrangements were observed in β-hCG-overexpressing ES-2 cells, while 
β-hCG-depleted SKOV3 cells produced the opposite effect. Furthermore, β-hCG was 
confirmed to clearly facilitate intraperitoneal metastasis in nude mouse 
orthotopic ovarian xenograft models. Importantly, these effects of β-hCG were 
mediated by activation of the ERK/MMP2 signaling pathway, independently of 
luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) presence, and 
inhibition the pathway with the p-ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 significantly 
impaired the tumor-promoting effects induced by β-hCG. Collectively, these data 
provide new insight into the roles and mechanisms of β-hCG in regulating EOC 
metastasis through ERK/MMP2 signaling pathway and may become a new target for 
therapeutic intervention.
