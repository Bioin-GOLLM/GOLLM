IMPORTANCE: Repetitive head impact (RHI) exposure is the chief risk factor for 
chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, the occurrence and severity of 
CTE varies widely among those with similar RHI exposure. Limited evidence 
suggests that the APOEε4 allele may confer risk for CTE, but previous studies 
were small with limited scope.
OBJECTIVE: To test the association between APOE genotype and CTE neuropathology 
and related endophenotypes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional genetic association 
study analyzed brain donors from February 2008 to August 2019 from the Veterans 
Affairs-Boston University-Concussion Legacy Foundation Brain Bank. All donors 
had exposure to RHI from contact sports or military service. All eligible donors 
were included. Analysis took place between June 2020 and April 2022.
EXPOSURES: One or more APOEε4 or APOEε2 alleles.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: CTE neuropathological status, CTE stage (0-IV), 
semiquantitative phosphorylated tau (p-tau) burden in 11 brain regions (0-3), 
quantitative p-tau burden in the dorsolateral frontal lobe (log-transformed AT8+ 
pixel count per mm2), and dementia.
RESULTS: Of 364 consecutive brain donors (100% male; 53 [14.6%] self-identified 
as Black and 311 [85.4%] as White; median [IQR] age, 65 [47-77] years) 20 years 
or older, there were 294 individuals with CTE and 70 controls. Among donors 
older than 65 years, APOEε4 status was significantly associated with CTE stage 
(odds ratio [OR], 2.34 [95% CI, 1.30-4.20]; false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected 
P = .01) and quantitative p-tau burden in the dorsolateral frontal lobe (β, 1.39 
[95% CI, 0.83-1.94]; FDR-corrected P = 2.37 × 10-5). There was a nonsignificant 
association between APOEε4 status and dementia (OR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.06-6.61]; 
FDR-corrected P = .08). Across 11 brain regions, significant associations were 
observed for semiquantitative p-tau burden in the frontal and parietal cortices, 
amygdala, and entorhinal cortex (OR range, 2.45-3.26). Among football players, 
the APOEε4 association size for CTE stage was similar to playing more than 7 
years of football. Associations were significantly larger in the older half of 
the sample. There was no significant association for CTE status. Association 
sizes were similar when donors with an Alzheimer disease neuropathological 
diagnosis were excluded and were reduced but remained significant after 
adjusting for neuritic and diffuse amyloid plaques. No associations were 
observed for APOEε2 status. Models were adjusted for age at death and race.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: APOEε4 may confer increased risk for CTE-related 
neuropathological and clinical outcomes among older individuals with RHI 
exposure. Further work is required to validate these findings in an independent 
sample.
