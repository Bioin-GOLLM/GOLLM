Genetic forms of parkinsonism are interesting for two particular reasons. First, 
finding a gene identifies a cause for a disease that would otherwise be 
unexplained. Second, finding several genes for the same disorder allows us to 
reconstruct molecular pathways that, in the example of Parkinson's disease, are 
be associated with the survival of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Two 
rare causes of parkinsonism, DJ-1 and PINK1, are associated with mitochondria. 
This organelle has long been linked with Parkinson's disease, and recent results 
are starting to show how mutations impact mitochondrial function. In this short 
review, I will discuss how we can use some of this information to understand why 
it is that neurons become dysfunctional in PD.
