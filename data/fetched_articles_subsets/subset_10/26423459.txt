Understanding the mechanisms of chromosomal double-strand break repair (DSBR) 
provides insight into genome instability, oncogenesis and genome engineering, 
including disease gene correction. Research into DSBR exploits rare-cutting 
endonucleases to cleave exogenous reporter constructs integrated into the 
genome. Multiple reporter constructs have been developed to detect various DSBR 
pathways. Here, using a single endogenous reporter gene, the X-chromosomal 
disease gene encoding hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), we monitor 
the relative utilization of three DSBR pathways following cleavage by I-SceI or 
CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases. For I-SceI, our estimated frequencies of accurate or 
mutagenic non-homologous end-joining and gene correction by homologous 
recombination are 4.1, 1.5 and 0.16%, respectively. Unexpectedly, I-SceI and 
Cas9 induced markedly different DSBR profiles. Also, using an I-SceI-sensitive 
HPRT minigene, we show that gene correction is more efficient when using long 
double-stranded DNA than single- or double-stranded oligonucleotides. Finally, 
using both endogenous HPRT and exogenous reporters, we validate novel cell cycle 
phase-specific I-SceI derivatives for investigating cell cycle variations in 
DSBR. The results obtained using these novel approaches provide new insights 
into template design for gene correction and the relationships between multiple 
DSBR pathways at a single endogenous disease gene.
