Retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) belong to the metabolically most 
active tissues in the human body. Efficient removal of acid load from retina and 
RPE is a critical function mediated by the choriocapillaris. However, the 
mechanism by which pH homeostasis is maintained is largely unknown. Here, we 
show that a functional complex of carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4) and Na+/bicarbonate 
co-transporter 1 (NBC1) is specifically expressed in the choriocapillaris and 
that missense mutations in CA4 linked to autosomal dominant rod-cone dystrophy 
disrupt NBC1-mediated HCO3- transport. Our results identify a novel pathogenic 
pathway in which a defect in a functional complex involved in maintaining pH 
balances, but not expressed in retina or RPE, leads to photoreceptor 
degeneration. The importance of a functional CA4 for survival of photoreceptors 
implies that CA inhibitors, which are widely used as medications, particularly 
in the treatment of glaucoma, may have long-term adverse effects on vision.
