Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) have critical functions in acute leukemia (AL) 
pathogenesis, participating in its initiation and relapse. Thus, identifying new 
molecules to eradicate LSCs represents a high priority for AL management. This 
work identified E35, a novel Emodin derivative, which strongly inhibited growth 
and enhanced apoptosis of AL stem cell lines, and primary stem and progenitor 
cells from AL cases, while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, 
functional assays in cultured cells and animals suggested that E35 
preferentially ablated primitive leukemia cell populations without impairing 
their normal counterparts. Moreover, molecular studies showed that E35 
remarkably downregulated drug-resistant gene and dramatically inhibited the 
Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. Notably, the in vivo 
anti-LSC activity of E35 was further confirmed in murine xenotransplantation 
models. Collectively, these findings indicate E35 constitutes a novel 
therapeutic candidate for AL, potentially targeting leukemia stem and progenitor 
cells.
