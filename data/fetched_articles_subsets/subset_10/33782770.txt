BACKGROUND: Left ventricular longitudinal strain (LVLS) may be a sensitive 
indicator of left ventricular (LV) systolic function in patients with sepsis, 
but is dependent on high image quality and analysis software. Mitral annular 
plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) and the novel left ventricular longitudinal 
wall fractional shortening (LV-LWFS) are bedside echocardiographic indicators of 
LV systolic function that are less dependent on image quality. Both are sparsely 
investigated in the critically ill population, and may potentially be used as 
surrogates for LVLS. We assessed if LVLS may be predicted by LV-LWFS and MAPSE 
in patients with septic shock. We also assessed the repeatability and 
inter-rater agreement of LVLS, LV-LWFS and MAPSE measurements.
RESULTS: 122 TTE studies from 3 echocardiographic data repositories of patients 
admitted to ICU with septic shock were retrospectively assessed, of which 73 
were suitable for LVLS analysis using speckle tracking. The correlations between 
LVLS vs. LV-LWFS and LVLS vs. MAPSE were 0.89 (p < 0.001) and 0.81 (p < 0.001) 
with mean squared errors of 5.8% and 9.1%, respectively. Using the generated 
regression equation, LV-LWFS predicted LVLS with a high degree of accuracy and 
precision, with bias and limits of agreement of -0.044 ± 4.7% and mean squared 
prediction error of 5.8%. Interobserver repeatability was good, with high 
intraclass correlation coefficients (0.96-0.97), small bias and tight limits of 
agreement (≤ 4.1% for all analyses) between observers for all measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: LV-LWFS may be used to estimate LVLS in patients with septic shock. 
MAPSE also performed well, but was slightly inferior compared to LV-LWFS in 
estimating LVLS. Feasibility of MAPSE and LV-LWFS was excellent, as was 
interobserver repeatability.
