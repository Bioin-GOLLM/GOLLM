BACKGROUND: activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS) and the 
compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS) plays a key role in schizophrenia 
(SCZ) and treatment resistant SCZ. There are only a few data on immune and 
endogenous opioid system (EOS) interactions in SCZ and treatment resistant SCZ.
METHODS: we examined serum β-endorphin, endomorphin-2 (EM2), mu-opioid (MOR) and 
kappa-opioid (KOR) receptors, and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 in 60 non 
responders to treatment (NRTT), 55 partial RTT (PRTT) and 43 normal controls.
RESULTS: serum EM2, KOR, MOR, IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly increased in SCZ 
as compared with controls. β-endorphin, EM2, MOR and IL-6 were significantly 
higher in NRTT than in PRTT. There were significant correlations between IL-6, 
on the one hand, and β-endorphin, EM2, KOR, and MOR, on the other, while IL-10 
was significantly correlated with MOR only. A large part of the variance in 
negative symptoms, psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, psychomotor 
retardation and formal thought disorders was explained by the combined effects 
of EM2 and MOR with or without IL-6 while increased KOR was significantly 
associated with all symptom dimensions. Increased MOR, KOR, EM2 and IL-6 were 
also associated with neurocognitive impairments including in episodic, semantic 
and working memory and executive functions.
CONCLUSION: the EOS contributes to SCZ symptomatology, neurocognitive 
impairments and a non-response to treatment. In SCZ, EOS peptides/receptors may 
exert CIRS functions, whereas increased KOR levels may contribute to the 
pathophysiology of SCZ and EM2 and KOR to a non-response to treatment.
