Endosomal sorting of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a key 
role in the biogenesis of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Genetic lesions underlying 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) can act by interfering with this physiological process. 
Specifically, proteins involved in trafficking between endosomal compartments 
and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) [including the retromer complex (Vps35, Vps26) 
and its putative receptors (sortilin, SorL1, SorCS1)] have been implicated in 
the molecular pathology of late-onset AD. Previously, we demonstrated a role for 
SorCS1 in APP metabolism and Aβ production and, while we implicated a role for 
the retromer in this regulation, the underlying mechanism remained poorly 
understood. Here, we provide evidence for a motif within the SorCS1c cytoplasmic 
tail that, when manipulated, results in perturbed sorting of APP and/or its 
fragments to endosomal compartments, decreased retrograde TGN trafficking, and 
increased Aβ production in H4 neuroglioma cells. These perturbations apparently 
do not involve turnover of the cell surface APP pool, but rather they involve 
intracellular APP and/or its fragments, downstream of APP endocytosis.
