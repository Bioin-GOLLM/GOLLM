The objectives of the study were: (1) the evaluation of the blood serum 
concentration of ZAG (Zinc-alpha 2 Glycoprotein) in girls with anorexia nervosa, 
as well as in girls with simple obesity and healthy girls; and (2) the valuation 
of the relationship between the blood level of ZAG and the duration of AN and 
anthropometric parameters, parameters of the lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, 
thyroid hormones, and cortisol in the blood in all study subjects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study covered 87 girls (aged 11-17.9 years). The 
studied group (AN) contained 30 girls suffering from anorexia nervosa, and the 
control groups contained 30 healthy girls (H) and 27 girls with simple obesity 
(OB), respectively.
RESULTS: The mean concentration of ZAG in the blood serum in the AN group was 
significantly higher than in the OB and H groups. Accumulatively, the level of 
ZAG in the entire studied group correlated negatively with the parameters of 
their nutritional status. The mean concentrations of ZAG in the entire group 
correlated positively with the concentrations of HDL and cortisol and negatively 
with insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, and hsCRP.
CONCLUSIONS: The higher blood concentrations of ZAG in girls with AN compared to 
healthy subjects seemed to constitute a secondary adaptation mechanism in 
response to the undernourishment status. ZAG blood concentration values 
correlated negatively with body mass, BMI, Cole's index, the level of insulin, 
and the HOMA-IR score, whereas they correlated positively with the level of 
cortisol. Increased ZAG levels in AN patients may result from increased levels 
of cortisol, manifesting in malfunction along the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis, which in effect can promote body weight loss.
