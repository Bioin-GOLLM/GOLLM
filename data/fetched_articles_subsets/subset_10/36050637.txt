BACKGROUND: Deficient endometrial decidualization has been associated with URSA. 
However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. This study aimed to 
investigate the temporal cytokine changes and the involvement of CyclinD-CDK4/6 
and CyclinE-CDK2 pathways in the regulation of the G1 phase of the cell cycle 
during decidualization in a murine model of URSA.
METHODS: Serum and decidual tissues of mice were collected from GD4 to GD8. The 
embryo resorption and abortion rates were observed on GD8 and the decidual 
tissue status was assessed. In addition, PRL, Cyclin D, CDK6, CDK4, Cyclin E, 
CDK2 expression in mice were measured.
RESULTS: URSA mice showed high embryo resorption rate and PRL, Cyclin D, Cyclin 
E CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 down-regulation during decidualization. The hyperactivated 
Cyclin D-CDK4/CDK6 and cyclin E/CDK2 pathways inhibit the decidualization 
process and leading to deficient decidualization.
CONCLUSION: Insufficient decidualization is an important mechanism of URSA. 
which is related to the decrease of Cyclin D、Cyclin E、 CDK2、CDK4 and CDK6 in 
decidualization process of URSA.
