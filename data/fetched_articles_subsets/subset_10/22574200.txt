Postnatal permanent childhood hearing impairment (PCHI) is frequent 
(0.25%-0.99%) and difficult to detect in the early stage, which may impede the 
speech, language and cognitive development of affected children. Genetic tests 
of common variants associated with postnatal PCHI in newborns may provide an 
efficient way to identify those at risk. In this study, we detected a strong 
association of the p.V37I exclusive genotype of GJB2 with postnatal PCHI in 
Chinese Hans (P = 1.4×10(-10); OR 62.92, 95% CI 21.27-186.12). This common 
genotype in Eastern Asians was present in a substantial percentage (20%) of 
postnatal PCHI subjects, and its prevalence was significantly increased in 
normal-hearing newborns who failed at least one newborn hearing screen. Our 
results indicated that the p.V37I exclusive genotype of GJB2 may cause 
subclinical hearing impairment at birth and increases risk for postnatal PCHI. 
Genetic testing of GJB2 in East Asian newborns will facilitate prompt detection 
and intervention of postnatal PCHI.
