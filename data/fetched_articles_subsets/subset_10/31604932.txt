Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is an allotetraploid species derived from recent 
whole genome duplication and provides a model to study polyploid genome 
evolution in vertebrates. Here, we generate three chromosome-level reference 
genomes of C. carpio and compare to related diploid Cyprinid genomes. We 
identify a Barbinae lineage as potential diploid progenitor of C. carpio and 
then divide the allotetraploid genome into two subgenomes marked by a distinct 
genome similarity to the diploid progenitor. We estimate that the two diploid 
progenitors diverged around 23 Mya and merged around 12.4 Mya based on the 
divergence rates of homoeologous genes and transposable elements in two 
subgenomes. No extensive gene losses are observed in either subgenome. Instead, 
we find gene expression bias across surveyed tissues such that subgenome B is 
more dominant in homoeologous expression. CG methylation in promoter regions may 
play an important role in altering gene expression in allotetraploid C. carpio.
