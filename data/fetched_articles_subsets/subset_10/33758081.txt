Complement, contact activation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis are serum protein 
cascades that need strict regulation to maintain human health. Serum 
glycoprotein, a C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), is a key regulator (inhibitor) of serine 
proteases of all the above-mentioned pathways. Recently, an autotransporter 
protein, virulence-associated gene 8 (Vag8), produced by the whooping cough 
pathogen, Bordetella pertussis, was shown to bind to C1-INH and interfere with 
its function. Here, we present the structure of the Vag8-C1-INH complex 
determined using cryo-electron microscopy at a 3.6-Å resolution. The structure 
shows a unique mechanism of C1-INH inhibition not employed by other pathogens, 
where Vag8 sequesters the reactive center loop of C1-INH, preventing its 
interaction with the target proteases.IMPORTANCE The structure of a 10-kDa 
protein complex is one of the smallest to be determined using cryo-electron 
microscopy at high resolution. The structure reveals that C1-INH is sequestered 
in an inactivated state by burial of the reactive center loop in Vag8. By so 
doing, the bacterium is able to simultaneously perturb the many pathways 
regulated by C1-INH. Virulence mechanisms such as the one described here assume 
more importance given the emerging evidence about dysregulation of contact 
activation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis leading to COVID-19 pneumonia.
