Beta-ketothiolases are involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the 
metabolism of hormones, benzenoids, and hydroxybutyrate. The expression of 
bacterial beta-ketothiolase in flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) results in an 
increase in endogenous beta-ketothiolase mRNA levels and beta-hydroxybutyrate 
content. In the present work, the effect of overexpression of beta-ketothiolase 
on retting and stem and fibre composition of flax plants is presented. The 
content of the components was evaluated by high-performance liquid 
chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, Fourier-transform infrared 
spectroscopy, and biochemical methods. Changes in the stem cell walls, 
especially in the lower lignin and pectin content, resulted in more efficient 
retting. The overexpression of beta-ketothiolase reduced the fatty acid and 
carotenoid contents in flax and affected the distribution of phenolic compounds 
between free and cell wall-bound components. The obtained fibres were 
characterized by a slightly lower content of phenolic compounds and changes in 
the composition of the cell wall. Based on the IR analysis, we concluded that 
the production of hydroxybutyrate reduced the cellulose crystallinity and led to 
the formation of shorter but more flexible cellulose chains, while not changing 
the content of the cell wall components. We speculate that the changes in 
chemical composition of the stems and fibres are the result of the regulatory 
properties of hydroxybutyrate. This provides us with a novel way to influence 
metabolic composition in agriculturally important crops.
