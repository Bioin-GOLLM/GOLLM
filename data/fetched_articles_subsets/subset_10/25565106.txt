Here, using single-molecule FRET, we reveal previously hidden conformations of 
the ankyrin-repeat domain of AnkyrinR, a giant adaptor molecule that anchors 
integral membrane proteins to the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton through 
simultaneous binding of multiple partner proteins. We show that the ankyrin 
repeats switch between high-FRET and low-FRET states, controlled by an 
unstructured "safety pin" or "staple" from the adjacent domain of AnkyrinR. 
Opening of the safety pin leads to unravelling of the ankyrin repeat stack, a 
process that will dramatically affect the relative orientations of AnkyrinR 
binding partners and, hence, the anchoring of the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton to 
the membrane. Ankyrin repeats are one of the most ubiquitous molecular 
recognition platforms in nature, and it is therefore important to understand how 
their structures are adapted for function. Our results point to a striking 
mechanism by which the order-disorder transition and, thereby, the activity of 
repeat proteins can be regulated.
