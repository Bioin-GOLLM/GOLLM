Adipocyte progenitors (APs) express platelet-derived growth factor receptors 
(PDGFRs), PDGFRα and PDGFRβ. Elevated PDGFRα signaling inhibits adipogenesis and 
promotes fibrosis; however, the function of PDGFRs in APs remains unclear. We 
combined lineage tracing and functional analyses in a sequential 
dual-recombinase approach that creates mosaic Pdgfr mutant cells by Cre/lox 
recombination with a linked Flp/frt reporter to track individual cell fates. 
Using mosaic lineage labeling, we show that adipocytes are derived from the 
Pdgfra lineage during postnatal growth and adulthood. In contrast, adipocytes 
are only derived from the mosaic Pdgfrb lineage during postnatal growth. 
Functionally, postnatal mosaic deletion of PDGFRα enhances adipogenesis and 
adult deletion enhances β3-adrenergic-receptor-induced beige adipocyte 
formation. Mosaic deletion of PDGFRβ also enhances white, brown, and beige 
adipogenesis. These data show that both PDGFRs are cell-autonomous inhibitors of 
adipocyte differentiation and implicate downregulation of PDGF signaling as a 
critical event in the transition from AP to adipocyte.
