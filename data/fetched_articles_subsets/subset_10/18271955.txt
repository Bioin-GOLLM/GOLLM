BACKGROUND: Chemotherapeutic drug efflux via the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) 
transporter encoded by the MDR1/ABCB1 gene is a significant cause of drug 
resistance in numerous malignancies, including acute leukemias, especially in 
older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therefore, the P-gp modulators 
that block P-gp-mediated drug efflux have been developed, and used in 
combination with standard chemotherapy. In this paper, the capacity of 
zosuquidar, a specific P-gp modulator, to reverse chemoresistance was examined 
in both leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts.
METHODS: The transporter protein expressions were analyzed by flow cytometry 
using their specific antibodies. The protein functionalities were assessed by 
the uptake of their fluorescence substrates in presence or absence their 
specific modulators. The drug cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT test.
RESULTS: Zosuquidar completely or partially restored drug sensitivity in all 
P-gp-expressing leukemia cell lines tested and enhanced the cytotoxicity of 
anthracyclines (daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone) and gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin (Mylotarg) in primary AML blasts with active P-gp. In addition, P-gp 
inhibition by zosuquidar was found to be more potent than cyclosporine A in 
cells with highly active P-gp.
CONCLUSION: These in vitro studies suggest that zosuquidar may be an effective 
adjunct to cytotoxic chemotherapy for AML patients whose blasts express P-gp, 
especially for older patients.
