Open reading frame 6 (ORF6), the accessory protein of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that suppresses host type-I interferon 
signaling, possesses amyloidogenic sequences. ORF6 amyloidogenic peptides 
self-assemble to produce cytotoxic amyloid fibrils. Currently, the molecular 
properties of the ORF6 remain elusive. Here, we investigate the structural 
dynamics of the full-length ORF6 protein in a near-physiological environment 
using high-speed atomic force microscopy. ORF6 oligomers were ellipsoidal and 
readily assembled into ORF6 protofilaments in either a circular or a linear 
pattern. The formation of ORF6 protofilaments was enhanced at higher 
temperatures or on a lipid substrate. ORF6 filaments were sensitive to aliphatic 
alcohols, urea, and SDS, indicating that the filaments were predominantly 
maintained by hydrophobic interactions. In summary, ORF6 self-assembly could be 
necessary to sequester host factors and causes collateral damage to cells via 
amyloid aggregates. Nanoscopic imaging unveiled the innate molecular behavior of 
ORF6 and provides insight into drug repurposing to treat amyloid-related 
coronavirus disease 2019 complications.
