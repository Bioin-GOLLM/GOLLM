In 2018, African swine fever broke out in China, and the death rate after 
infection was close to 100%. There is no effective and safe vaccine in the 
world. In order to better characterize and understand the virus-host-cell 
interaction, quantitative proteomics was performed on porcine alveolar 
macrophages (PAM) infected with ASFV through tandem mass spectrometry (TMT) 
technology, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry 
(MS). The proteome difference between the simulated group and the ASFV-infected 
group was found at 24 h. A total of 4218 proteins were identified, including 306 
up-regulated differentially expressed proteins and 238 down-regulated 
differentially expressed proteins. Western blot analysis confirmed changes in 
the expression level of the selected protein. Pathway analysis is used to reveal 
the regulation of protein and interaction pathways after ASFV infection. 
Functional network and pathway analysis can provide an insight into the 
complexity and dynamics of virus-host cell interactions. Further study combined 
with proteomics data found that ARG1 has a very important effect on ASFV 
replication. It should be noted that the host metabolic pathway of 
ARG1-polyamine is important for virus replication, revealing that the virus may 
facilitate its own replication by regulating the level of small molecules in the 
host cell.
