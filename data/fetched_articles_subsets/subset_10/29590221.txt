INTRODUCTION: Increasing use of factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors necessitates 
effective reversal agents to manage bleeding. Andexanet alfa, a novel modified 
recombinant human FXa, rapidly reverses the anticoagulation effects of direct 
and indirect FXa inhibitors.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of andexanet to reverse anticoagulation in 
vitro and reduce bleeding in rabbits administered edoxaban.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro studies characterized the interaction of 
andexanet with edoxaban and its ability to reverse edoxaban-mediated anti-FXa 
activity. In a rabbit model of surgically induced, acute hemorrhage, animals 
received edoxaban vehicle+andexanet vehicle (control), edoxaban (1 
mg/kg)+andexanet vehicle, edoxaban+andexanet (75 mg, 5-minute infusion, 20 
minutes after edoxaban), or edoxaban vehicle+andexanet prior to injury.
RESULTS: Andexanet bound edoxaban with high affinity similar to FXa. Andexanet 
rapidly and dose-dependently reversed the effects of edoxaban on FXa activity 
and coagulation pharmacodynamic parameters in vitro. In edoxaban-anticoagulated 
rabbits, andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity by 82% (from 548±87 to 100±41 
ng/ml; P<0.0001), mean unbound edoxaban plasma concentration by ~80% (from 
100±10 to 21±6 ng/ml; P<0.0001), and blood loss by 80% vs. vehicle (adjusted for 
control, 2.6 vs. 12.9 g; P = 0.003). The reduction in blood loss correlated with 
the decrease in anti-FXa activity (r = 0.6993, P<0.0001) and unbound edoxaban (r 
= 0.5951, P = 0.0035).
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that andexanet rapidly reversed the 
anticoagulant effects of edoxaban, suggesting it could be clinically valuable 
for the management of acute and surgery-related bleeding. Correlation of blood 
loss with anti-FXa activity supports the use of anti-FXa activity as a biomarker 
for assessing anticoagulation reversal in clinical trials.
