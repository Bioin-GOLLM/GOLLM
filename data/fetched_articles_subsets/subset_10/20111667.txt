Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) also known as DiGeorge, conotruncal anomaly 
face and Cayler syndromes is caused by a microdeletion in the long arm of 
chromosome 22. We review the history of the syndrome from the first clinical 
reports almost half a century ago to the current intriguing molecular findings 
associating genes from the microdeletion region and the physical and 
neuropsychiatric phenotype of the syndrome. Velocardiofacial syndrome has a wide 
spectrum of more than 200 physical manifestations including palate and cardiac 
anomalies. Yet, the most challenging manifestations of VCFS are the learning 
disabilities and neuropsychiatric disorders. As VCFS is relatively common and as 
up to one third of the subjects with VCFS develop schizophrenia like psychotic 
disorder the syndrome is the most commonly known genetic risk factor to 
schizophrenia. Identifying the genetic, cognitive and psychiatric risk factors 
for VCFS-schizophrenia is under the focus of intensive research.
