In this randomized blinded study, we investigated caffeine 5 mg/kg treatment 
given directly after neonatal brain hypoxia ischemia. Brain morphology, behavior 
and key brain infiltrating immune populations were examined. Caffeine treatment 
significantly improves outcome when compared to phosphate buffered saline. Flow 
cytometric analysis of immune responses revealed no persistent immunological 
alterations. Given its safety caffeine emerges as a candidate for 
neuroprotective intervention after neonatal brain injury.
