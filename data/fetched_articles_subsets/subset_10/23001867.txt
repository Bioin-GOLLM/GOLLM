Over the last three decades, virus-like particles (VLPs) have evolved to become 
a widely accepted technology, especially in the field of vaccinology. In fact, 
some VLP-based vaccines are currently used as commercial medical products, and 
other VLP-based products are at different stages of clinical study. Several 
remarkable advantages have been achieved in the development of VLPs as gene 
therapy tools and new nanomaterials. The analysis of published data reveals that 
at least 110 VLPs have been constructed from viruses belonging to 35 different 
families. This review therefore discusses the main principles in the cloning of 
viral structural genes, the relevant host systems and the purification 
procedures that have been developed. In addition, the methods that are used to 
characterize the structural integrity, stability, and components, including the 
encapsidated nucleic acids, of newly synthesized VLPs are analyzed. Moreover, 
some of the modifications that are required to construct VLP-based carriers of 
viral origin with defined properties are discussed, and examples are provided.
