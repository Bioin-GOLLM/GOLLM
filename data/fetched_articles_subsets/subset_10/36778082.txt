At the core of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technology, the endonuclease Cas9 
introduces site-specific breaks in DNA. However, precise mechanistic information 
to ameliorating Cas9 function is still missing. Here, multi-microsecond 
molecular dynamics, free-energy and multiscale simulations are combined with 
solution NMR and DNA cleavage experiments to resolve the catalytic mechanism of 
target DNA cleavage. We show that the conformation of an active HNH nuclease is 
tightly dependent on the catalytic Mg2+, unveiling its cardinal structural role. 
This activated Mg2+-bound HNH is consistently described through molecular 
simulations, solution NMR and DNA cleavage assays, revealing also that the 
protonation state of the catalytic H840 is strongly affected by active site 
mutations. Finally, ab-initio QM(DFT)/MM simulations and metadynamics establish 
the catalytic mechanism, showing that the catalysis is activated by H840 and 
completed by K866, rationalising DNA cleavage experiments. This information is 
critical to enhance the enzymatic function of CRISPR-Cas9 toward improved 
genome-editing.
