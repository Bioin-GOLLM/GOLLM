Limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a heterogeneous group of genetic 
disorders leading to progressive muscle degeneration and often associated with 
cardiac complications. We present two adult siblings with childhood-onset of 
weakness progressing to a severe quadriparesis with the additional features of 
triangular tongues and biventricular cardiac dysfunction. Whole exome sequencing 
identified compound heterozygous missense mutations that are predicted to be 
pathogenic in LIMS2. Biopsy of skeletal muscle demonstrated disrupted 
immunostaining of LIMS2. This is the first report of mutations in LIMS2 and 
resulting disruption of the integrin linked kinase (ILK)-LIMS-parvin complex 
associated with LGMD.
