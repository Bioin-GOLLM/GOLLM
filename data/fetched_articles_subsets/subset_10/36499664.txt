Mesenchymal stem cells have a known regenerative potential and are used in many 
indications. They secrete many growth factors, including for fibroblasts (FGF), 
endothelium (VEGF), as well as 14 anti-inflammatory cytokines, and they 
stimulate tissue regeneration, promoting the secretion of proteins and 
glycosaminoglycans of extracellular matrices, such as collagen I, II, III, and 
V, elastin, and also metalloproteinases. They secrete exosomes that contain 
proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and enzymes. In addition, they show the 
activity of inactivating free radicals. The aim of this study was an attempt to 
collect the existing literature on the use of stem cells in the treatment of a 
burn wound. There were 81 studies included in the analysis. The studies differed 
in terms of the design, burn wound model, source of stem cells, and methods of 
cellular therapy application. No major side effects were reported, and cellular 
therapy reduced the healing time of the burn wound. Few case reports on human 
models did not report any serious adverse events. However, due to the 
heterogeneity of the evidence, cellular therapy in burn wound treatment remains 
an experimental method.
