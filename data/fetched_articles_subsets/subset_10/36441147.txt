Gated by intracellular ATP and ADP, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels 
couple cell energetics with membrane excitability in many cell types, enabling 
them to control a wide range of physiological processes based on metabolic 
demands. The KATP channel is a complex of four potassium channel subunits from 
the Kir channel family, Kir6.1 or Kir6.2, and four sulfonylurea receptor 
subunits, SUR1, SUR2A, or SUR2B, from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter 
family. Dysfunction of KATP channels underlies several human diseases. The 
importance of these channels in human health and disease has made them 
attractive drug targets. How the channel subunits interact with one another and 
how the ligands interact with the channel to regulate channel activity have been 
long-standing questions in the field. In the past 5 yr, a steady stream of 
high-resolution KATP channel structures has been published using single-particle 
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Here, we review the advances these 
structures bring to our understanding of channel regulation by physiological and 
pharmacological ligands.
