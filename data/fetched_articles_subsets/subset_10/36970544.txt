The Sotos syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by 
haploinsufficiency of NSD1 gene, with some individuals affected by epilepsy and, 
rarely, drug-resistant seizures. A 47-years-old female patient with Sotos 
syndrome was diagnosed with focal-onset seizures in left temporal lobe, 
left-side hippocampal atrophy, and neuropsychological testing with decreased 
performance in several cognitive domains. Patient was treated with left-side 
temporal lobe resection and developed complete awake seizure control in 3-years 
of follow-up, with marked improvement in quality-of-life. In selected, 
clinically concordant patients, resective surgeries may play a significant role 
in improving patient's quality of life and seizure control.
