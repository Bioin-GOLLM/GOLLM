Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a silent global health problem that can lead 
to suicide. MDD development is suggested to result from numerous risk factors, 
including genetic factors. A precise tool for MDD diagnosis is currently not 
available. Recently, inflammatory processes have been identified as being 
strongly involved in MDD development and the reactivation of human herpesvirus 
type 6 (HHV-6), upregulating cytokines such as TNF-α, which are associated with 
MDD. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association of HHV-6 with 
genetic factors, especially TNF-α mutation, in MDD patients and their relatives 
compared to healthy controls. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used 
to evaluate MDD status, and 471 oral buccal samples were investigated for HHV-6 
infection and viral copy number by qPCR. TNF-α (-308G/A) gene mutation and the 
cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 were analyzed by high-resolution melting (HRM) 
analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Whole-exome sequencing 
of buccal samples was performed to analyze for genetic factors. The results 
showed significantly higher HHV-6 positivities and viral loads in MDD patients 
(15/59 (25.67%) and 14,473 ± 16,948 copies/µL DNA) and their relatives (blood 
relatives 17/36 (47.22%) and 8146 ± 5656 copies/µL DNA); non-blood relatives 
7/16 (43.75%) and 20,721 ± 12,458 copies/µL DNA) compared to the healthy 
population (51/360 (14.17%) and 6303 ± 5791 copies/µL DNA). The TNF-α (-308G/A) 
mutation showed no significant difference. Surprisingly, 12/26 (46.15%) 
participants with the TNF-α (-308G/A) mutation showed HHV-6 positivities at 
higher rates than those with wild-type TNF-α (-308G) (70/267 (26.22%)). 
HHV-6-positive participants with TNF-α (-308G/A) showed higher levels of TNF-α, 
IL-6, and IL-10 than those of negative control. Exome analysis revealed that 
common mutations in immune genes were associated with depression. Therefore, 
this study unveiled the novel association of inflammatory gene TNF-α (-308G/A) 
mutations with HHV-6 reactivation, which could represent a combined risk factor 
for MDD. This result could induce further research on MDD development and 
clinical applications.
