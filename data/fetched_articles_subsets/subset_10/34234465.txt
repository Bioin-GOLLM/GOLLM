OBJECTIVE: To study the association between radioiodine refractory papillary 
thyroid carcinoma, sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) expression, and the BRAF V600E 
mutation.
METHODS: A study was conducted on 30 radioiodine refractory papillary thyroid 
carcinoma patients and 30 radioiodine-avid papillary thyroid carcinoma patients. 
The expressions of sodium/iodide symporter and BRAF V600E mutated protein were 
determined by immunohistochemistry using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
tissue.
RESULTS: The mutated BRAF V600E protein was identified in 26 radioiodine 
refractory papillary thyroid carcinoma subjects (86.7%) and 22 radioiodine-avid 
papillary thyroid carcinoma subjects (73.3%), with no significant difference 
between the 2 groups (P = 0.3). Sodium/iodide symporter expression was detected 
in 4 of 30 cases (13.3%) from the radioiodine-avid papillary thyroid carcinoma 
group but was negative for all radioiodine refractory cases. There was no 
association between sodium/iodide symporter expression and radioiodine 
refractory papillary thyroid carcinoma (P = 0.11). Cases with positive NIS 
expression were likely negative for BRAF V600E mutation (3/4; P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Papillary thyroid carcinomas with BRAF V600E mutation were more 
likely to be negative for NIS expression. BRAF V600E mutation and NIS 
expressions cannot be used to predict radioiodine sensitivity.
