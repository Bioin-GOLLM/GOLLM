Previous studies have led to the identification of three biosynthetically 
related molecular forms of somatostatin (somatostatin-14, -34 and -37) from the 
pancreas of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). We have now isolated from the 
brain of the same species a second form of somatostatin-14 that is identical to 
mammalian somatostatin-14 and differs from lamprey pancreatic somatostatin-14 by 
the substitution Ser12 to Thr. Larger forms of somatostatin were not identified 
in lamprey brain in this study. These data suggest that the two molecular forms 
of lamprey somatostatin-14 are the products of different genes that are 
expressed in a tissue-specific manner.
