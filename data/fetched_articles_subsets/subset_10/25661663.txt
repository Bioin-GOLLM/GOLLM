AIM: To identify risk alleles contributing towards type 1 diabetes in Pakistani 
patients.
INTRODUCTION: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease which is caused by 
destruction of insulin producing β cells by immune system. Genetic 
predisposition as well as environmental factors contribute to its etiology. To 
date more than 40 risk loci have been identified for T1D.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 191 family-based and unrelated T1D cases and controls 
were recruited. DNA was extracted and 32 genome-wide significant single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported in Europeans were genotyped. 
Genotyping was performed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays and the data was 
analyzed using FamCC software.
RESULTS: Our results showed significant association of 10 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) with T1D at p<0.01, including HLA-DQA1/rs9272346, 
ERBB3/rs2292239, SIRPG/rs2281808, IL2-KIAA1109/rs4505848, GLIS3/rs7020673, 
CD226/rs763361, PTPN2/rs478582, IKZF1/rs10272724, BACH2/rs11755527, 
C6orf173/rs9388489, whereas 5 more SNPs showed their association at 0.01<p<0.05 
in Pakistani population.
CONCLUSION: We have replicated many of the T1D loci established among Europeans 
in a Pakistani population.
