BACKGROUND & AIM: Whether inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) gene polymorphisms 
predict anemia during interferon-free therapy in chronic hepatitis C virus 
(HCV)-infected patients is unknown. We examined the relationship between two 
ITPA polymorphisms, anemia, and sustained virological response 12 weeks 
post-treatment (SVR12) in patients receiving the NS3/4A protease inhibitor 
faldaprevir, the non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor deleobuvir, and ribavirin.
METHODS: HCV genotype 1-infected, treatment-naïve patients (N = 362) were 
randomized and treated in one of five treatment arms with faldaprevir and 
deleobuvir with or without ribavirin. Two ITPA polymorphisms (rs1127354 and 
rs6051702) were genotyped and defined as ITPA-deficient (rs1127354 AA or AC; 
rs6051702 CC or CA) or ITPA-non-deficient (rs1127354 CC; rs6051702 AA) according 
to their association with ITPA deficiency. Baseline and on-treatment variables 
associated with anemia and SVR12 were identified using logistic regression.
RESULTS: In the pooled ribavirin-containing arms, 10.1% (32/316) of patients 
experienced on-treatment hemoglobin <10 g/dL, and 32.6% (103/316) experienced 
on-treatment hemoglobin <10 g/dL or a change from baseline ≥3.5 g/dL. Of the 
latter group, 99% (102/103) had the ITPA-non-deficient rs1127354 genotype. Other 
variables associated with on-treatment hemoglobin <10 g/dL or a decrease ≥3.5 
g/dL were age, baseline hemoglobin, rs6051702 genotype, and plasma ribavirin 
concentration. In a multivariate analysis, high plasma ribavirin concentration, 
low baseline hemoglobin, HCV genotype 1b, and IL28B genotype CC were associated 
with higher SVR12.
CONCLUSIONS: The ITPA rs1127354 CC and rs6051702 AA genotypes may predict 
ribavirin-induced anemia during treatment with interferon-free, 
ribavirin-containing regimens. With this interferon-free regimen, SVR was 
associated with ribavirin levels, but not with anemia or ITPA genotypes.
