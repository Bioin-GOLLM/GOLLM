Nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A are the epigenetic mark of 
centromeres, the kinetochore assembly sites required for chromosome segregation. 
HJURP is the CENP-A chaperone, which associates with Mis18α, Mis18β, and M18BP1 
to target centromeres and deposit new CENP-A. How these proteins interact to 
promote CENP-A deposition remains poorly understood. Here we show that two 
repeats in human HJURP proposed to be functionally distinct are in fact 
interchangeable and bind concomitantly to the 4:2:2 Mis18α:Mis18β:M18BP1 complex 
without dissociating it. HJURP binds CENP-A:H4 dimers, and therefore assembly of 
CENP-A:H4 tetramers must be performed by two Mis18αβ:M18BP1:HJURP complexes, or 
by the same complex in consecutive rounds. The Mis18α N-terminal tails blockade 
two identical HJURP-repeat binding sites near the Mis18αβ C-terminal helices. 
These were identified by photo-cross-linking experiments and mutated to separate 
Mis18 from HJURP centromere recruitment. Our results identify molecular 
underpinnings of eukaryotic chromosome inheritance and shed light on how 
centromeres license CENP-A deposition.
