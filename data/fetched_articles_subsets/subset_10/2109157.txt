We report here the study of the glycosylation pattern of human recombinant (r) 
IL2 expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The human rIL2 
secreted by this high-producing recombinant CHO cell line was metabolically 
radiolabelled with [35S]-methionine, or with [3H]-glucosamine and 
[3H]-galactose, purified to homogeneity, and then characterized. The 
electrophoretic analysis of the [35S]-methionine-labelled proteins present in 
the culture medium of the CHO cell line showed that the rIL2 represents 
approximately 12% of the total secreted proteins. Furthermore, pulse-chase 
experiments showed that the glycosylated rIL2 is synthesized and secreted within 
30 min. The point of attachment and the structure of the carbohydrate moiety of 
the rIL2 was determined by: amino-terminal sequencing and fingerprint analysis 
of the 3H-labelled rIL2, mass spectroscopy of the amino-terminal tryptic 
octapeptide, and carbohydrate analysis after enzymatic (Vibrio cholerae 
neuraminidase and Aspergillus oryzae beta-galactosidase) or sulfuric acid 
hydrolysis. The results indicate that the recombinant protein possesses a sugar 
moiety O-linked to the threonine residue at position 3 of the polypeptide chain, 
and that sialic acid, galactose and N-acetyl galactosamine are components of 
this carbohydrate moiety. Taken together these results suggest that the 
recombinant molecule is identical to natural IL2.
