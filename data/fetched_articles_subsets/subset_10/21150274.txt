The Ataxia-Telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is regarded as the major 
regulator of the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). In 
response to DSBs, ATM dimers dissociate into active monomers in a process 
promoted by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex. ATM can also be activated by 
oxidative stress directly in the form of exposure to H2O2. The active ATM in 
this case is a disulfide-crosslinked dimer containing 2 or more disulfide bonds. 
Mutation of a critical cysteine residue in the FATC domain involved in disulfide 
bond formation specifically blocks ATM activation by oxidative stress. Here we 
show that ATM activation by DSBs is inhibited in the presence of H2O2 because 
oxidation blocks the ability of MRN to bind to DNA. However, ATM activation via 
direct oxidation by H2O2 complements the loss of MRN/DSB-dependent activation 
and contributes significantly to the overall level of ATM activity in the 
presence of both DSBs and oxidative stress.
