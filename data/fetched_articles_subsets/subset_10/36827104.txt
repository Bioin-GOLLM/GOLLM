Marine natural products (MNPs) play an important role in the discovery and 
development of new drugs. The Beibu Gulf of South China Sea harbors four 
representative marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, mangroves, seaweed 
beds, and coastal wetlands, which are rich in underexplored marine biological 
resources that produce a plethora of diversified MNPs. In our ongoing efforts to 
discover novel and biologically active MNPs from the Beibu Gulf, we provide a 
systematic overview of the sources, chemical structures, and bioactive 
properties of a total of 477 new MNPs derived from the Beibu Gulf, citing 133 
references and covering the literature from the first report in November 2003 up 
to September 2022. These reviewed MNPs were structurally classified into 
polyketides (43%), terpenoids (40%), nitrogen-containing compounds (12%), and 
glucosides (5%), which mainly originated from microorganisms (52%) and 
macroorganisms (48%). Notably, they were predominantly found with cytotoxic, 
antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities. This review will shed light on 
these untapped Beibu Gulf-derived MNPs as promising lead compounds for the 
development of new drugs.
