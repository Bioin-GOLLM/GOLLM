In plant cells, translation occurs in three compartments: the cytosol, the 
plastids and the mitochondria. While the structures of the (prokaryotic-type) 
ribosomes in plastids and mitochondria are well characterized, high-resolution 
structures of the eukaryotic 80S ribosomes in the cytosol have been lacking. 
Here the structure of translating tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) 80S ribosomes was 
solved by cryo-electron microscopy with a global resolution of 2.2 Å. The 
ribosome structure includes two tRNAs, decoded mRNA and the nascent peptide 
chain, thus providing insights into the molecular underpinnings of the cytosolic 
translation process in plants. The map displays conserved and plant-specific 
rRNA modifications and the positions of numerous ionic cofactors, and it 
uncovers the role of monovalent ions in the decoding centre. The model of the 
plant 80S ribosome enables broad phylogenetic comparisons that reveal 
commonalities and differences in the ribosomes of plants and those of other 
eukaryotes, thus putting our knowledge about eukaryotic translation on a firmer 
footing.
