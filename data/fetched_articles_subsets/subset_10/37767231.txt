BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like 
episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a rare mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations 
in mitochondrial DNA, resulting in impaired energy production and affecting 
multiple organs. We present a suspected MELAS syndrome case with the initial 
symptom of chest tightness.
CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old man sought medical attention due to progressively 
worsening chest tightness during physical activity. He had been receiving 
treatment for type 2 diabetes for 15 years. One year ago, he presented with 
symptoms of hearing impairment. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed 
increased thickness of the left ventricular wall. Serum protein electrophoresis 
showed no evidence of light-chain amyloidosis, and the 
99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid scan showed no definite 
uptake in the heart muscle. The patient's head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
indicated lacunar infarcts. The lactate threshold test was positive. The biopsy 
of the skeletal muscle showed broken red fibre infiltration on modified Gomori 
trichrome staining, and electron microscopy revealed signs of mitochondrial 
cardiomyopathy, including mild mitochondrial swelling, lipid accumulation, and 
myofibril damage. A whole-exome genetic test was used to detect the m.3243A>G 
mutation in the MT-TL1 gene. Based on these findings, MELAS syndrome was the 
most probable diagnosis.
DISCUSSION: The patient presented with chest tightness in adulthood, without any 
accompanying psychoneurological symptoms. However, the patient presented with 
other symptoms, including diabetes mellitus, hearing loss, abnormal lactate 
levels, ischaemic lesions on head MRI, and left ventricular hypertrophy. By 
identifying a mutation in the MT-TL1 gene and conducting a muscle biopsy, the 
diagnosis of MELAS syndrome was definitively confirmed.
