BACKGROUND: Biallelic CLN3 gene variants have been found in either 
juvenile-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) or isolated retinal 
dystrophy. It has been reported that most JNCL patients carry a common 1.02-kb 
deletion variant homozygously. Clinical characteristics of patients with 
biallelic CLN3 missense variants are not well elucidated.
METHODS: We described a 26-year-old Japanese male patient with isolated retinal 
dystrophy. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) were performed.
RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous CLN3 missense 
variant [c.482C>T; p.(Ser161Leu)]. Ophthalmoscopy revealed retinal degeneration 
and macular atrophy, and later attenuated retinal vessels. Severely reduced 
responses were observed in both rod and cone electroretinograms. In TEM of the 
patient's lymphocytes, fingerprint profiles, which are specific findings in 
CLN3-associated JNCL, were observed in 16/624 (2.56%) lymphocytes of the 
patient, who has never exhibited neurological signs during the 13-year follow-up 
period.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that this novel CLN3 missense variant is 
associated with teenage-onset isolated retinal dystrophy. This is the first 
report of any patient with CLN3-associated disorder in the Japanese population. 
Although fingerprint profiles have never been reported in CLN3-associated 
isolated retinal dystrophy, these profiles were observed, albeit infrequently, 
suggesting that frequency of the fingerprint profiles might depend on variant 
types.
