Electrical energy storage in redox flow batteries has received increasing 
attention. Redox flow batteries using organic compounds, especially 
quinone-based molecules, as active materials are of particular interest owing to 
the material sustainability, tailorable redox properties, and environmental 
friendliness of quinones and their derivatives. In this report, various quinone 
derivatives were investigated to determine their suitability for applications in 
organic RFBs. Moreover, the redox potential could be internally regulated 
through the tuning of σ and π bonding contribution at the redox-active sites. 
Furthermore, the binding geometry of some selected quinone derivatives with 
metal cations was studied. These studies provide an alternative strategy to 
identify and design new quinone molecules with suitable redox potentials for 
electrical energy storage in organic RFBs.
