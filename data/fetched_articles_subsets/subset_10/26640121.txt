In this study, we have described a sensitive HIV-1 single cycle replicating 
virus that expresses a secreted Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) as a biomarker. This 
single cycle replicating virus was produced by the co-transfection of 293T cells 
with a multiple gene-deleted HIV provirus (ΔRI/ΔE/Gluc) and CMVin-Gag/Pol and 
viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) plasmids. The results showed that this HIV-1 
virus efficiently infected and was restricted to one replication cycle in 
primary CD4+ T cells, macrophages and CD4+ T cell-grafted nude mouse. Because 
the viral genomic DNA lacks reverse transcriptase and integrase genes and has a 
partial deletion in the env gene, this trans-complemented virus could not be 
converted into the wild type virus after multiple passages in highly susceptible 
CD4+ C8166 T cells, demonstrating the safety of this system. Furthermore, 
infection with this virus was easily monitored by detecting the Gluc activity in 
the cell culture supernatants or in the animal peritoneal fluid or blood, which 
was shown to be more sensitive than the anti-p24 ELISA assay. This 
trans-complemented virus system is valuable for various HIV single cycle 
infection and viral expression studies in the laboratory where a biosafety 
level-3 containment facility is not accessible.
