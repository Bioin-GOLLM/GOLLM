BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing Enterobacterales 
(ESBL-E) are disseminating worldwide especially in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) 
and are responsible for increased health costs and mortality. The aims of this 
work were to study ESBL-E dissemination in ICU and to assess the impact of 
ESBL-E fecal carriage on subsequent infections during a non-outbreak situation.
METHODS: We therefore screened every patient at admission then once a week in a 
medical ICU between January and June 2015. Each ESBL-E isolate was characterized 
by ESBL genes PCR amplification and the clonal dissemination was assessed by 
Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE).
RESULTS: Among the 608 screened patients, 55 (9%) were colonized by ESBL-E. 
Forty-four isolates were available for further analysis. Most of them (43/44, 
98%) contained a ESBL gene from the CTX-M group. Only one case of ESBL-E 
cross-transmission occurred, even for acquired ESBL-E colonization. Subsequent 
infection by ESBL-E occurred in 6/55 (11%) patients and infecting ESBL-E strains 
were the colonizing ones. ESBL-E faecal carriage had a negative predictive value 
of 100% and a positive predictive value of 40% to predict ESBL-E ventilator 
associated-pneumonia (VAP). Alternatives to carbapenems consisting in 
piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam were 
all active on this panel of ESBL-E.
CONCLUSIONS: ESBL-E expansion and acquisition in ICU in a non-outbreak situation 
are not any more fully explained by cross-transmission. Mechanisms underlying 
ESBL-E dissemination in ICU are still to investigate. Interestingly, as far as 
we know, our study demonstrates for the first time by PFGE that the colonizing 
strain is indeed the infecting one in case of subsequent ESBL-E infection. 
Nevertheless, subsequent ESBL-E infection remains a rare event conferring poor 
positive predictive value for ESBL-E colonization to predict ESBL-E VAP. 
Relevance of systematic ESBL-E faecal screening at ICU admission and during ICU 
stay needs further investigation.
