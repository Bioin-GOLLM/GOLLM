Up to 25% of postpartum women experience psychological distress including 
stress, depressive, or anxiety symptoms during the postpartum period. The 
purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which social determinants of 
health and allostatic load score, a 10-item index of biologic measures of 
chronic stress, predict psychological distress in low-income pregnant women over 
the first postpartum year. We conducted a secondary data analysis of the Child 
Community Health Research Network data set. The psychological distress outcome 
variables were perceived stress (n = 842), depression ( n = 845), and anxiety ( 
n = 846) symptoms, all measured categorically over the first year postpartum 
(T1:1 month, T2: 24-29 weeks, and T3: 50-65 weeks). Our predictors were social 
determinants of health (e.g., demographics, maternal hardship, percent poverty 
level, interpersonal violence, and food security) and allostatic load score. 
Generalized linear mixed models were used to determine which predictors were 
significantly associated with psychological distress symptoms across the first 
postpartum year. Interpersonal violence was a statistically significant risk 
factor for stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms over the first year 
postpartum. Other significant risk factors included low-income level, nativity, 
and perceived food security. Receiving food stamps was a significant protective 
factor for stress symptoms. The significance of risk factors for psychological 
distress, both modifiable and nonmodifiable, can be used as potential targets 
for further research, screening, and intervention. Future work should explore 
why and in what conditions these risk factors vary over time.
