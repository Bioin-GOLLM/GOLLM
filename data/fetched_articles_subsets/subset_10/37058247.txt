Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and 
thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T) is a rare disease, which presents with features of 
myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts and essential thrombocythemia, 
as well as anemia and marked thrombocytosis. SF3B1 and JAK2 mutations are often 
found in patients, and are associated with their specific clinical features. 
This study was a retrospective analysis of 34 Japanese patients with 
MDS/MPN-RS-T. Median age at diagnosis was 77 (range, 51-88) years, and patients 
had anemia (median hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL) and thrombocytosis (median platelet 
count: 642 × 109/L). Median overall survival was 70 (95% confidence interval: 
68-not applicable) months during the median follow-up period of 26 (range: 0-91) 
months. A JAK2V617F mutation was detected in 46.2% (n = 12) of analyzed patients 
(n = 26), while an SF3B1 mutation was detected in 87.5% (n = 7) of analyzed 
patients (n = 8). Like those with myelodysplastic syndromes or 
myeloproliferative neoplasms, patients often received erythropoiesis-stimulating 
agents and aspirin to improve anemia and prevent thrombosis. This study, which 
was the largest to describe the real-world characteristics of Japanese patients 
with MDS/MPN-RS-T, showed that the patients had similar characteristics to those 
in western countries.
