BACKGROUND: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC), is a type of digestive tract cancer 
with the highest mortality all over the word, and its exact pathogenesis is not 
clear. Therefore, it is of great significance to search for genes related to PC 
and elucidate its molecular mechanism.
METHODS: We integrated and analyzed 8 microarray datasets from the Gene 
Expression Comprehensive Database (GEO) and PC patient information from the 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to identified differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) based on standardized annotation information. The overlapped DEGs both in 
the GEO and TCGA datasets were identified as key genes. Kaplan-Meier 
comprehensive expression scoring method was conducted to determine whether the 
key genes are related to the survival rate of PC. The expression of those key 
genes was analyzed by GEPIA and UALCAN. Lastly, Cox regression model was used to 
construct a gene prognosis signature.
RESULTS: The TSPAN1 gene was identified that might be highly related to the 
pathogenesis of PC. Further analysis showed high expression of TSPAN1 was 
closely related to the stage 2, moderately differentiated (intermediate grade), 
and poorly differentiated (high grade) of PC. Finally, we build a four-gene 
prognosis signature (AIM2, B3GNT3, MATK and BEND4), which can be applied to 
predict overall survival (OS) effectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We revealed promising genes that may participate in the 
pathophysiology of PC, and found available biomarkers for PC prognosis 
prediction, which were significant for researchers to further understand the 
molecular basis of PC and direct the synthesis medicine of PC.
