Mastocytosis is a disease characterized by pathological mast cell accumulation 
and activation in tissues. Most patients with mastocytosis exhibit the D816V 
point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the transmembrane receptor 
protein Kit, leading to its constitutive activation in bone marrow or lesional 
skin tissue. Detection of a codon 816 c-kit mutation is included as a minor 
diagnostic criterion in the World Health Organization's diagnostic criteria for 
systemic mastocytosis. Determining mutational status of the c-kit gene also has 
pharmacogenomic implications in patients considered for investigational mast 
cell cytoreductive therapies. This article reviews diagnostic and therapeutic 
implications of c-kit mutations as well as other less common molecular 
abnormalities observed in mast cell disease.
