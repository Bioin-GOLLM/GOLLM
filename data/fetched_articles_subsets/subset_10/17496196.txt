recurrent pneumothorax.

RATIONALE: Birt-Hogg-Dub√© (BHD) syndrome, a rare inherited autosomal 
genodermatosis first recognised in 1977, is characterised by fibrofolliculomas 
of the skin, an increased risk of renal tumours and multiple lung cysts with 
spontaneous pneumothorax. The BHD gene, a tumour suppressor gene located at 
chromosome 17p11.2, has recently been shown to be defective. Recent genetic 
studies revealed that clinical pictures of the disease may be variable and may 
not always present the full expression of the phenotypes.
OBJECTIVES: We hypothesised that mutations of the BHD gene are responsible for 
patients who have multiple lung cysts of which the underlying causes have not 
yet been elucidated.
METHODS: We studied eight patients with lung cysts, without skin and renal 
disease; seven of these patients have a history of spontaneous pneumothorax and 
five have a family history of pneumothorax. The BHD gene was examined using PCR, 
denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing.
MAIN RESULTS: We found that five of the eight patients had a BHD germline 
mutation. All mutations were unique and four of them were novel, including three 
different deletions or insertions detected in exons 6, 12 and 13, respectively 
and one splice acceptor site mutation in intron 5 resulting in an in-frame 
deletion of exon 6.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that germline mutations of the BHD gene are involved in 
some patients with multiple lung cysts and pneumothorax. Pulmonologists should 
be aware that BHD syndrome can occur as an isolated phenotype with pulmonary 
involvement.
