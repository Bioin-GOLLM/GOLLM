The E2 protein of the carcinogen human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) regulates 
replication and transcription of the viral genome in association with viral and 
cellular proteins. Our previous work demonstrated that E2 can regulate 
transcription from the host genome. E2 can activate transcription from adjacent 
promoters when located upstream using E2 DNA binding sequences and this 
activation is dependent upon the cellular protein Brd4; this report demonstrates 
that a Brd4 binding E2 mutant alters host genome expression differently from 
wild type E2. Of particular note is that highly down regulated genes are mostly 
not affected by failure to interact with Brd4 suggesting that the E2-Brd4 
interaction is more responsible for the transcriptional activation of host genes 
rather than repression. Therefore failure to interact efficiently with Brd4, or 
altered levels of Brd4, would alter the ability of E2 to regulate the host 
genome and could contribute to determining the outcome of infection.
