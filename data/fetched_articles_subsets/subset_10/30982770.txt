Cell-autonomous Wnt signaling has well-characterized functions in controlling 
stem cell activity, including in the prostate. While niche cells secrete Wnt 
ligands, the effects of Wnt signaling in niche cells per se are less understood. 
Here, we show that stromal cells in the proximal prostatic duct near the 
urethra, a mouse prostate stem cell niche, not only produce multiple Wnt ligands 
but also exhibit strong Wnt/β-catenin activity. The non-canonical Wnt ligand 
Wnt5a, secreted by proximal stromal cells, directly inhibits proliefration of 
prostate epithelial stem or progenitor cells whereas stromal cell-autonomous 
canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling indirectly suppresses prostate stem or 
progenitor activity via the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway. 
Collectively, these pathways restrain the proliferative potential of epithelial 
cells in the proximal prostatic ducts. Human prostate likewise exhibits 
spatially restricted distribution of stromal Wnt/β-catenin activity, suggesting 
a conserved mechanism for tissue patterning. Thus, this study shows how distinct 
stromal signaling mechanisms within the prostate cooperate to regulate tissue 
homeostasis.
