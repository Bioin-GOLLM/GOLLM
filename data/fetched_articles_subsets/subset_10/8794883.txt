The human V2 vasopressin receptor belongs to the superfamily of G 
protein-coupled receptors believed to be anchored to the plasma membrane by 
seven transmembrane regions. The extracellular portion of the human V2 
vasopressin receptor contains one site susceptible to N-linked glycosylation. 
Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of the receptor expressed in 
transfected cells were applied to examine whether the protein was indeed 
glycosylated. The V2 vasopressin receptor expressed transiently was 
glycosylated, but glycosidase treatment to test the complexity of the sugar 
moiety linked to asparagine revealed that the majority of the receptor protein 
lacked complex carbohydrates, an indication of an improperly processed protein. 
This immature protein displayed a tendency to form aggregates. In contrast with 
these data, testing of the sugar complexity of the receptor protein synthesized 
in stably transfected cells identified the predominant form as an appropriately 
processed receptor protein. Mutagenesis of asparagine 22 to glutamine produced 
on expression in transfected cells a nonglycosylated receptor with ligand 
binding affinity and coupling characteristics almost identical to those of the 
wild-type form. After exposure to elevated concentrations of AVP (100 nM), the 
nonglycosylated form desensitized to the same extent as the wild-type receptor.
