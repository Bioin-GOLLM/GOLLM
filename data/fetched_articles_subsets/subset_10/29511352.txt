Tumor metastasis depends on the dynamic regulation of cell adhesion through 
β1-integrin. The Cub-Domain Containing Protein-1, CDCP1, is a transmembrane 
glycoprotein which regulates cell adhesion. Overexpression and loss of CDCP1 
have been observed in the same cancer types to promote metastatic progression. 
Here, we demonstrate reduced CDCP1 expression in high-grade, primary prostate 
cancers, circulating tumor cells and tumor metastases of patients with 
castrate-resistant prostate cancer. CDCP1 is expressed in epithelial and not 
mesenchymal cells, and its cell surface and mRNA expression declines upon 
stimulation with TGFβ1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Silencing of 
CDCP1 in DU145 and PC3 cells resulted in 3.4-fold higher proliferation of 
non-adherent cells and 4.4-fold greater anchorage independent growth. 
CDCP1-silenced tumors grew in 100% of mice, compared to 30% growth of 
CDCP1-expressing tumors. After CDCP1 silencing, cell adhesion and migration 
diminished 2.1-fold, caused by loss of inside-out activation of β1-integrin. We 
determined that the loss of CDCP1 reduces CDK5 kinase activity due to the 
phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit, CDK5R1/p35, by c-SRC on Y234. This 
generates a binding site for the C2 domain of PKCδ, which in turn phosphorylates 
CDK5 on T77. The resulting dissociation of the CDK5R1/CDK5 complex abolishes the 
activity of CDK5. Mutations of CDK5-T77 and CDK5R1-Y234 phosphorylation sites 
re-establish the CDK5/CDKR1 complex and the inside-out activity of β1-integrin. 
Altogether, we discovered a new mechanism of regulation of CDK5 through loss of 
CDCP1, which dynamically regulates β1-integrin in non-adherent cells and which 
may promote vascular dissemination in patients with advanced prostate cancer.
