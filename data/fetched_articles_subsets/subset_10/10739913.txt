The Ser195Ala mutant of human alpha-thrombin was complexed with fibrinopeptide 
A(7-22) (FPA) in an effort to describe the (P1'-P6') post-cleavage binding 
subsites of the fibrinogen-recognition exosite and define more clearly the 
nature of the Michaelis complex and the scissile peptide bond bound at the 
catalytic site. The thrombin mutant, however, has residual catalytic activity 
and proteolysis occurred at the Arg16-Gly17 bond. Thus, the structure of the 
thrombin complex determined was that of FPA(7-16) bound at the active site, 
which is very similar to the ternary FPA(7-16)cmk-human thrombin-hirugen complex 
(r.m.s.d. approximately 0.4 A; Stubbs et al. , 1992). It is further shown by 
subsidiary experiments that the cleavage is the result of residual catalytic 
activity of the altered catalytic machinery.
