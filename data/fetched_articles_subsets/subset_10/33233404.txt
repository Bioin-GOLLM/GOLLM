Blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a marker of neuro-axonal injury showing 
promising associations with outcomes of interest in several neurological 
conditions. Although initially discovered and investigated in the cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF), the recent development of ultrasensitive digital immunoassay 
technologies has enabled reliable detection in serum/plasma, obviating the need 
for invasive lumbar punctures for longitudinal assessment. The most evidence for 
utility relates to multiple sclerosis (MS) where it serves as an objective 
measure of both the inflammatory and degenerative pathologies that characterise 
this disease. In this review, we summarise the physiology and pathophysiology of 
neurofilaments before focusing on the technological advancements that have 
enabled reliable quantification of NfL in blood. As the test case for clinical 
translation, we then highlight important recent developments linking blood NfL 
levels to outcomes in MS and the next steps to be overcome before this test is 
adopted on a routine clinical basis.
