SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 100 million deaths and continues to spread rapidly 
around the world. Asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is the Achilles' heel 
of COVID-19 public health control measures. Phylogenomic data on SARS-CoV-2 
could provide more direct information about asymptomatic transmission. In this 
study, using a novel MINERVA sequencing technology, we traced asymptomatic 
transmission of COVID-19 patients in Beijing, China. One hundred and 
seventy-eight close contacts were quarantined, and 14 COVID-19 patients were 
laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR. We provide direct phylogenomic evidence of 
asymptomatic transmission by constructing the median joining network in the 
cluster. These data could help us to determine whether the current symptom-based 
screening should cover asymptomatic persons.
