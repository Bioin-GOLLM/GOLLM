Epithelial-Splicing-Regulatory-Protein 1 (Esrp1) is a cell-type specific 
RNA-binding protein (RBP) that is essential for mammalian development through 
maintenance of epithelial cell properties including barrier function. Esrp1 also 
regulates splicing during the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). It 
contains three highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) in the absence of 
other clearly defined protein domains. Esrp1 itself is also alternatively 
spliced to produce multiple protein isoforms. Here we determined that two 
competing alternative 5' splice sites in exon 12 yield Esrp1 isoforms with 
differential nucleocytoplasmic localization. We carried out a detailed 
characterization of the Esrp1 peptide that is sufficient to confer nuclear 
localization. Furthermore, we identified splice variants encoding distinct 
nuclear and cytoplasmic isoforms of fusilli, the D. Melanogaster Esrp1 ortholog. 
Our observations demonstrate that the production of both nuclear and cytoplasmic 
Esrp1 isoforms through alternative splicing is phylogenetically conserved; 
strongly suggesting it is biologically significant. Thus, while previous studies 
have described extensive regulation by nuclear Esrp1 to promote epithelial 
specific splicing, it will be of great interest to study the contribution of 
cytoplasmic Esrp1 in maintenance of epithelial cell functions.
