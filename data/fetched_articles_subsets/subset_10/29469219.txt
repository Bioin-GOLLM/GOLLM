AIM: Erdheim-Chester disease represents a clonal systemic proliferation of 
histiocytes. Bone is the most common site of involvement, although almost any 
organ, including the lungs, can be affected.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease can be difficult, 
owing to its rarity and protean presentation. Correlation between clinical, 
radiological and histological findings is mandatory for identification of the 
disease. Foamy histiocytes, lacking Langerhans cell markers, represent the 
typical histological findings, although their absence does not rule out 
Erdheim-Chester disease. Identification of BRAF mutation can be helpful in 
making the diagnosis, and allows for the development and application of targeted 
therapies in this setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we describe two cases presenting with lung involvement and 
vertebral lesions, lacking the more typical long-bone involvement. One case 
histologically mimicked Rosai-Dorfman disease. However, both cases harboured the 
pathognomonic BRAFV600E mutation.
