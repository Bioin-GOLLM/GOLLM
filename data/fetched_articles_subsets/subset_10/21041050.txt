Alexander disease is a major entity of leukodystrophy; magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) studies of the brain typically show extensive changes in the 
cerebral white matter with frontal predominance. Heterozygous missense mutations 
of GFAP are thought to be sufficient for the molecular diagnosis, which has 
widened the Alexander disease entity beyond the classical one. We report the 
patient, a 16-year-old Japanese boy, with infantile-onset Alexander disease, 
showing striking MRI findings; extreme white matter loss of cerebrum through 
cerebellum, severe atrophy of basal ganglia, cerebellum, brain stem, and 
cervical spinal cord. Molecular analysis showed a heterozygous mutation R239L 
(c.730G>T) in GFAP. A relative long disease course, over 15years, with the help 
of mechanical ventilation revealed the striking MRI progression.
