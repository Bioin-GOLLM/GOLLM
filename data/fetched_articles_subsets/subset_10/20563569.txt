PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of cytochrome 450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and ABCB1 variants 
on plasma risperidone concentrations and treatment response in 83 drug-naive 
patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis.
METHODS: All patients were treated with risperidone for 8 weeks. The CYP2D6 
genotyping was performed by allele-specific PCR-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism analysis (for alleles *3,*4,*6) and long-distance PCR (for 
duplications and allele *5), while real-time PCR analysis was used for the ABCB1 
G2677T/A and C3435T variants. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-OH 
risperidone were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.
RESULTS: The number of patients with the CYP2D6 wild type (wt)/wt, wt/mutation 
(mut) and mut/mut genotype was 43, 32 and 8, respectively. The number of 
patients with the ABCB1 2677G/G, G/T and T/T variants was 29, 42 and 12, 
respectively; those with the 3435CC, C/T and T/T variants was 25, 37 and 21, 
respectively. The CYP2D6 genotype had a strong effect on the steady-state 
dose-corrected plasma levels (C/D) of risperidone, its 9-OH metabolite and the 
active moiety, while the ABCB1 2677 T/T and 3435 T/T genotypes has similarly 
strong effects on the active moiety C/D. The CYP2D6 poor metabolizers had a 
significantly higher risperidone C/D and active moiety C/D and lower 9-OH 
risperidone C/D. The ABCB1 3435 T allele and the ABCB1 2667 T-3435 T haplotype 
carriers were more frequent among subjects without extrapyramidal syndromes. 
Patients showed significant improvements in positive and general symptoms, but 
not in negative symptoms. These changes were not related to variations in 
genetic and drug concentration data.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CYP2D6 and ABCB1 G2677T and C3435T may be 
useful determinants of risperidone plasma concentrations, but the clinical 
implications of these associations in relation to treatment response and 
side-effects remain unclear.
