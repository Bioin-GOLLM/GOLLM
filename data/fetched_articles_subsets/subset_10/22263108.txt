The pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer historically has relied primarily on 
morphologic features of tumors in histologic sections. With the emergence of new 
targeted therapies, the pathologist is called upon increasingly to provide not 
only accurate typing of lung cancers, but also to provide prognostic and 
predictive information, based on a growing number of ancillary tests, that may 
have significant impact on patient management. This review provides an overview 
of ancillary tests currently used in the pathologic diagnosis of lung cancer, 
with a focus on immunohistochemistry and molecular diagnostics.
