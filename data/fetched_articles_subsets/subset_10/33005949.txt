CONTEXT: 4H or POLR3-related leukodystrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder 
typically characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism, caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C, 
and POLR3K. The endocrine and growth abnormalities associated with this disorder 
have not been thoroughly investigated to date.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically characterize endocrine abnormalities of patients 
with 4H leukodystrophy.
DESIGN: An international cross-sectional study was performed on 150 patients 
with genetically confirmed 4H leukodystrophy between 2015 and 2016. Endocrine 
and growth abnormalities were evaluated, and neurological and other 
non-neurological features were reviewed. Potential genotype/phenotype 
associations were also investigated.
SETTING: This was a multicenter retrospective study using information collected 
from 3 predominant centers.
PATIENTS: A total of 150 patients with 4H leukodystrophy and pathogenic variants 
in POLR3A, POLR3B, or POLR1C were included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variables used to evaluate endocrine and growth 
abnormalities included pubertal history, hormone levels (estradiol, 
testosterone, stimulated LH and FSH, stimulated GH, IGF-I, prolactin, ACTH, 
cortisol, TSH, and T4), and height and head circumference charts.
RESULTS: The most common endocrine abnormalities were delayed puberty (57/74; 
77% overall, 64% in males, 89% in females) and short stature (57/93; 61%), when 
evaluated according to physician assessment. Abnormal thyroid function was 
reported in 22% (13/59) of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm pubertal abnormalities and short stature are 
the most common endocrine features seen in 4H leukodystrophy. However, we noted 
that endocrine abnormalities are typically underinvestigated in this patient 
population. A prospective study is required to formulate evidence-based 
recommendations for management of the endocrine manifestations of this disorder.
