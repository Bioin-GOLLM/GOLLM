Cumulative assessment groups of pesticides have been established for two 
specific effects on the thyroid: firstly hypothyroidism, and secondly 
parafollicular cell (C-cell) hypertrophy, hyperplasia and neoplasia. Sources of 
uncertainties resulting from the methodological approach and from the 
limitations in available data and scientific knowledge have been identified and 
considered. This report supports the publication of a scientific report on 
cumulative risk assessment to pesticides affecting the thyroid, in which all 
uncertainties identified for either the exposure assessment or the establishment 
of the cumulative assessment groups are incorporated into a consolidated risk 
characterisation.
