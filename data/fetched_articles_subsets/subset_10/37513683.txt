Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by varying degrees of difficulty 
in social interaction and communication. These deficits are often associated 
with gastrointestinal symptoms, indicating alterations in both intestinal 
microbiota composition and metabolic activities. The intestinal microbiota 
influences the function and development of the nervous system. In individuals 
with ASD, there is an increase in bacterial genera such as Clostridium, as well 
as species involved in the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) like 
Prevotella copri. Conversely, decreased amounts of Akkermansia muciniphila and 
Bifidobacterium spp. are observed. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of 
the polyphenols with the greatest beneficial activity on microbial growth, and 
its consumption is associated with reduced psychological distress. Therefore, 
the objective of this review is to analyze how EGCG and its metabolites can 
improve the microbial dysbiosis present in ASD and its impact on the pathology. 
The analysis reveals that EGCG inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria like 
Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile. Moreover, it increases the 
abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Akkermansia spp. As a result, EGCG 
demonstrates efficacy in increasing the production of metabolites involved in 
maintaining epithelial integrity and improving brain function. This identifies 
EGCG as highly promising for complementary treatment in ASD.
