The normal function of excision repair cross complementing group 1 (ERCC1) is 
essential for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing cellular neoplastic 
transformation, and multiple studies have reported an association between ERCC1 
polymorphisms and increased risk of cancers. To test whether the genetic 
variants of ERCC1 gene modify the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), we 
compared the 8092 C > A and 19007 C > T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
and the haplotypes of ERCC1 between 267 patients with NPC and 304 healthy 
controls. Linkage disequilibrium was observed between the two SNPs loci (D' = 
0.861). Significant differences of allele frequencies were found for ERCC1 8092C 
> A between the cases and controls. Individuals with 8092 C allele showed 
1.411-fold (OR = 1.411, 95% CI, 1.076-1.850, P = 0.014) increased risk of 
developing NPC, and the CC haplotype was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of NPC (OR = 1.712; 95% CI, 1.211-2.421; P = 0.013). No 
interactions were found between 8092C > A polymorphism and genders, smoking 
status and alcohol consumption. These results suggested that the polymorphism of 
ERCC1 8092 C > A might be a contributing factor in the development of NPC in 
Chinese population.
