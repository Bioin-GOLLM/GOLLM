Current conventional detection of SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a patient 
sample with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in a 
viral transport medium, extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse 
transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). We developed a simplified and novel preparation 
method using a Chelex resin that obviates RNA extraction during viral testing. 
Direct detection RT-qPCR and digital-droplet PCR was compared to the current 
conventional method with RNA extraction for simulated samples and patient 
specimens. The heat-treatment in the presence of Chelex markedly improved 
detection sensitivity as compared to heat alone, and lack of RNA extraction 
shortens the overall diagnostic workflow. Furthermore, the initial sample 
heating step inactivates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, thus improving workflow safety. 
This fast RNA preparation and detection method is versatile for a variety of 
samples, safe for testing personnel, and suitable for standard clinical 
collection and testing on high throughput platforms.
