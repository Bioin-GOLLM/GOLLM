The plasma membrane H+ -ATPase of fungi and plants is a single polypeptide of 
fewer than 1,000 residues that extrudes protons from the cell against a large 
electric and concentration gradient. The minimalist structure of this 
nanomachine is in stark contrast to that of the large multi-subunit FO F1 ATPase 
of mitochondria, which is also a proton pump, but under physiological conditions 
runs in the reverse direction to act as an ATP synthase. The plasma membrane H+ 
-ATPase is a P-type ATPase, defined by having an obligatory phosphorylated 
reaction cycle intermediate, like cation pumps of animal membranes, and thus, 
this pump has a completely different mechanism to that of FO F1 ATPases, which 
operates by rotary catalysis. The work that led to these insights in plasma 
membrane H+ -ATPases of fungi and plants has a long history, which is briefly 
summarized in this review.
