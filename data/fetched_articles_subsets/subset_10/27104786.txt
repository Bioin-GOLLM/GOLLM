Fruit ripening is a genetically programmed process. Transcription factors (TFs) 
play key roles in plant development and ripening by temporarily and spatially 
regulating the transcription of their target genes. In this study, a total of 
159 TFs were identified from a spontaneous late-ripening mutant 'Fengwan' (C. 
sinensis L. Osbeck) sweet orange (MT) and its wild-type counterpart ('Fengjie 
72-1', WT) along the ripening period via the Transcription Factor Prediction of 
PlantTFDB 3.0. Fifty-two differentially expressed TFs were identified between MT 
and WT; 92 and 120 differentially expressed TFs were identified in WT and MT, 
respectively. The Venn diagram analysis showed that 16 differentially expressed 
TFs were identified between MT and WT and during the ripening of WT and MT. 
These TFs were primarily assigned to the families of C2H2, Dof, bHLH, ERF, MYB, 
NAC and LBD. Particularly, the number of TFs of the ERF family was the greatest 
between MT and WT. According to the results of the WGCNA analysis, a weighted 
correlation network analysis tool, several important TFs correlated to abscisic 
acid (ABA), citric acid, fructose, glucose and sucrose were identified, such as 
RD26, NTT, GATA7 and MYB21/62/77. Hierarchical cluster analysis and the 
expression analysis conducted at five fruit ripening stages further validated 
the pivotal TFs that potentially function during orange fruit development and 
ripening.
