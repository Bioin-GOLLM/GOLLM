Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent currently used for preventing stent 
thrombosis. Despite certain clinical benefits of clopidogrel in patients 
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), adequate antiplatelet 
effect has not been obtained in some patients. The present study was designed to 
investigate the potential association of ABCB1 (ATP-Binding Cassette, Subfamily 
B, member1) gene polymorphism, and clopidogrel responsiveness in Iranian 
patients after PCI. Sixty-seven patients were included in the study. Blood 
samples were taken from patients at baseline, 2 h after administration of 600-mg 
loading dose of clopidogrel, 24 h and 30 days after PCI. Platelet aggregation 
was measured by light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) with two levels of 
adenosine diphosphate (ADP) concentrations (5 and 20 ÂµM). ABCB1 genotyping was 
performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction 
(RFLP-PCR). The allelic frequencies of wild type, heterozygote, and homozygote 
genotypes of ABCB1 were 20.9%, 74.6%, and 4.5%, respectively. There was no 
significant association between polymorphism of ABCB1 and clopidogrel 
non-responsiveness (P > 0.05) in various situations. No significant difference 
was observed for demographic characteristics. Genetic and demographic factors 
had no significant effect on the platelet activity of clopidogrel in an Iranian 
population.
