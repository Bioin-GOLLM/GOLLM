The subtypes of duodenal cancer (DC) are complicated and the carcinogenesis 
process is not well characterized. We present comprehensive characterization of 
438 samples from 156 DC patients, covering 2 major and 5 rare subtypes. 
Proteogenomics reveals LYN amplification at the chromosome 8q gain functioned in 
the transmit from intraepithelial neoplasia phase to infiltration tumor phase 
via MAPK signaling, and illustrates the DST mutation improves mTOR signaling in 
the duodenal adenocarcinoma stage. Proteome-based analysis elucidates 
stage-specific molecular characterizations and carcinogenesis tracks, and 
defines the cancer-driving waves of the adenocarcinoma and Brunner's gland 
subtypes. The drug-targetable alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS1) in the high tumor 
mutation burden/immune infiltration is significantly enhanced in DC progression, 
and catalyzes the lysine-alanylation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARP1), 
which decreases the apoptosis of cancer cells, eventually promoting cell 
proliferation and tumorigenesis. We assess the proteogenomic landscape of early 
DC, and provide insights into the molecular features corresponding therapeutic 
targets.
