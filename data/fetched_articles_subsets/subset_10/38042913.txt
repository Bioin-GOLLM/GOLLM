Aortic aneurysms, which may dissect or rupture acutely and be lethal, can be a 
part of multisystem disorders that have a heritable basis. We report four 
patients with deficiency of selenocysteine-containing proteins due to 
selenocysteine Insertion Sequence Binding Protein 2 (SECISBP2) mutations who 
show early-onset, progressive, aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta due 
to cystic medial necrosis. Zebrafish and male mice with global or vascular 
smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-targeted disruption of Secisbp2 respectively show 
similar aortopathy. Aortas from patients and animal models exhibit raised 
cellular reactive oxygen species, oxidative DNA damage and VSMC apoptosis. 
Antioxidant exposure or chelation of iron prevents oxidative damage in patient's 
cells and aortopathy in the zebrafish model. Our observations suggest a key role 
for oxidative stress and cell death, including via ferroptosis, in mediating 
aortic degeneration.
