Hypothalamic neurons expressing the anorectic peptide Pro-opiomelanocortin 
(Pomc) regulate food intake and body weight. Here, we show that Steroid Receptor 
Coactivator-1 (SRC-1) interacts with a target of leptin receptor activation, 
phosphorylated STAT3, to potentiate Pomc transcription. Deletion of SRC-1 in 
Pomc neurons in mice attenuates their depolarization by leptin, decreases Pomc 
expression and increases food intake leading to high-fat diet-induced obesity. 
In humans, fifteen rare heterozygous variants in SRC-1 found in severely obese 
individuals impair leptin-mediated Pomc reporter activity in cells, whilst four 
variants found in non-obese controls do not. In a knock-in mouse model of a loss 
of function human variant (SRC-1L1376P), leptin-induced depolarization of Pomc 
neurons and Pomc expression are significantly reduced, and food intake and body 
weight are increased. In summary, we demonstrate that SRC-1 modulates the 
function of hypothalamic Pomc neurons, and suggest that targeting SRC-1 may 
represent a useful therapeutic strategy for weight loss.
