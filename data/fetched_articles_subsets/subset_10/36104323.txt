Adaptive immunity depends on cell surface presentation of antigenic peptides by 
major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules and on stringent ER 
quality control in the secretory pathway. The chaperone tapasin in conjunction 
with the oxidoreductase ERp57 is crucial for MHC I assembly and for shaping the 
epitope repertoire for high immunogenicity. However, how the tapasin-ERp57 
complex engages MHC I clients has not yet been determined at atomic detail. 
Here, we present the 2.7-Å crystal structure of a tapasin-ERp57 heterodimer in 
complex with peptide-receptive MHC I. Our study unveils molecular details of 
client recognition by the multichaperone complex and highlights elements 
indispensable for peptide proofreading. The structure of this transient ER 
quality control complex provides the mechanistic basis for the selector function 
of tapasin and showcases how the numerous MHC I allomorphs are chaperoned during 
peptide loading and editing.
