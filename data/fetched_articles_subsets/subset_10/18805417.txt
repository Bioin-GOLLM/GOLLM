Helicobacter pylori produces a heat shock protein A (HspA) that is unique to 
this bacteria. While the first 91 residues (domain A) of the protein are similar 
to GroES, the last 26 (domain B) are unique to HspA. Domain B contains eight 
histidines and four cysteines and was suggested to bind nickel. We have produced 
HspA and two mutants: Cys94Ala and Cys94Ala/Cys111Ala and identified the 
disulfide bridge pattern of the protein. We found that the cysteines are engaged 
in three disulfide bonds: Cys51/Cys53, Cys94/Cys111 and Cys95/Cys112 that result 
in a unique closed loop structure for the domain B.
