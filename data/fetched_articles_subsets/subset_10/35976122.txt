The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha has been utilized as a model for biological 
studies since the 18th century. In the past few decades, there has been a 
Renaissance in its utilization in genomic and genetic approaches to 
investigating physiological, developmental, and evolutionary aspects of land 
plant biology. The reasons for its adoption are similar to those of other 
genetic models, e.g. simple cultivation, ready access via its worldwide 
distribution, ease of crossing, facile genetics, and more recently, efficient 
transformation, genome editing, and genomic resources. The haploid gametophyte 
dominant life cycle of M. polymorpha is conducive to forward genetic approaches. 
The lack of ancient whole-genome duplications within liverworts facilitates 
reverse genetic approaches, and possibly related to this genomic stability, 
liverworts possess sex chromosomes that evolved in the ancestral liverwort. As a 
representative of one of the three bryophyte lineages, its phylogenetic position 
allows comparative approaches to provide insights into ancestral land plants. 
Given the karyotype and genome stability within liverworts, the resources 
developed for M. polymorpha have facilitated the development of related species 
as models for biological processes lacking in M. polymorpha.
