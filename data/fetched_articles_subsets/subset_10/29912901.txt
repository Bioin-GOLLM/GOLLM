Wilms tumour is a childhood tumour that arises as a consequence of somatic and 
rare germline mutations, the characterisation of which has refined our 
understanding of nephrogenesis and carcinogenesis. Here we report that germline 
loss of function mutations in TRIM28 predispose children to Wilms tumour. Loss 
of function of this transcriptional co-repressor, which has a role in 
nephrogenesis, has not previously been associated with cancer. Inactivation of 
TRIM28, either germline or somatic, occurred through inactivating mutations, 
loss of heterozygosity or epigenetic silencing. TRIM28-mutated tumours had a 
monomorphic epithelial histology that is uncommon for Wilms tumour. Critically, 
these tumours were negative for TRIM28 immunohistochemical staining whereas the 
epithelial component in normal tissue and other Wilms tumours stained 
positively. These data, together with a characteristic gene expression profile, 
suggest that inactivation of TRIM28 provides the molecular basis for defining a 
previously described subtype of Wilms tumour, that has early age of onset and 
excellent prognosis.
