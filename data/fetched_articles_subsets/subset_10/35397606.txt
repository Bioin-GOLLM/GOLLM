BACKGROUND: Studies have revealed an important role of activating transcription 
factor 1 (ATF1) and phosphorylated ATF1 at Ser63 in tumors. Our previous study 
identified Thr184 as a novel phosphorylation site of ATF1. However, the role of 
phosphorylated ATF1 at Thr184 (p-ATF1-T184) in tumor is unclear. This study 
figured out the role of p-ATF1-T184 in the metastasis of gastric cancer (GC) and 
in the regulation of Matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2).
METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) was performed to analyze the level 
of p-ATF1-T184 and its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics. 
Wound scratch test, Transwell assay were used to observe the role of p-ATF1-T184 
in the invasion and metastasis of GC. The regulation of MMP2 by p-ATF1-T184 was 
investigated by a series of experiments including quantitative RT-PCR, western 
blot, gelatin zymography assay, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), luciferase 
reporter assay and cycloheximide experiment. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data 
were used to analyze the expression and prognostic role of ATF1 and MMP2 in GC. 
Mass spectrometry (MS) following co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay was 
performed to identify potential upstream kinases that would phosphorylate ATF1 
at Thr184.
RESULTS: High expression level of p-ATF1-T184 was found and significantly 
associated with lymph node metastasis and poor survival in a GC cohort of 126 
patients. P-ATF1-T184 promoted migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. 
Phosphorylation of ATF1-T184 could regulate the mRNA, protein expression and 
extracellular activity of MMP2. P-ATF1-T184 further increased the DNA binding 
ability, transcription activity, and stabilized the protein expression of ATF1. 
Moreover, TCGA data and IHC results suggested that the mRNA level of ATF1 and 
MMP2, and protein level of p-ATF1-T184 and MMP2 could be prognosis markers of 
GC. Two protein kinase related genes, LRBA and S100A8, were identified to be 
correlated with the expression ATF1 in GC.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that p-ATF1-T184 promoted metastasis of GC by 
regulating MMP2.
