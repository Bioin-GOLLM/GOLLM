BACKGROUND: The incidence and prevalence of multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A 
(MEN2A) have only been reported once in a nationwide setting. However, it is 
unclear whether the figures are representative of other populations, as the 
major component of the syndrome, hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 
has been reported as rare in the same country. We conducted a nationwide 
retrospective cohort study of MEN2A in Denmark from 1901 to 2014, aiming to 
describe the incidence and prevalence.
METHODS: This study included 250 unique MEN2A patients born or resident in 
Denmark before December 31, 2014. Patients were identified through the Danish 
REarranged during Transfection (RET) cohort, linkage of MEN2A pedigrees, the 
Danish MTC cohort, a nationwide collaboration of MEN2 centers, cross-checking of 
other relevant cohorts, and a systematic literature search.
RESULTS: The incidence from 1971 to 2000 was 28 (95% CI: 21-37) per million live 
births per year. Incidence for the specific mutations or for the overall MEN2A 
group did not change significantly from 1901 to 2014 (P>0.05). Point prevalence 
at January 1, 2015, was 24 per million (95% CI: 20-28).
CONCLUSION: The incidence and prevalence of MEN2A in Denmark seem higher than 
those reported in other countries. This is likely explained by the Danish C611Y 
founder effect. Also, our data indicate no significant change in MEN2A incidence 
during the last century.
