BACKGROUND: The genus Ilex (Aquifoliaceae) has a near-cosmopolitan distribution 
in mesic habitats from tropical to temperate lowlands and in alpine forests. It 
has a high rate of hybridization and plastid capture, and comprises four 
geographically structured plastid groups. A previous study showed that the 
plastid rbcL gene, coding for the large subunit of Rubisco, has a particularly 
high rate of non-synonymous substitutions in Ilex, when compared with other 
plant lineages. This suggests a strong positive selection on rbcL, involved in 
yet unknown adaptations. We therefore investigated positive selection on rbcL in 
240 Ilex sequences from across the global range.
RESULTS: The rbcL gene shows a much higher rate of positive selection in Ilex 
than in any other plant lineage studied so far (> 3000 species) by tests in both 
PAML and SLR. Most positively selected residues are on the surface of the folded 
large subunit, suggesting interaction with other subunits and associated 
chaperones, and coevolution between positively selected residues is prevalent, 
indicating compensatory mutations to recover molecular stability. Coevolution 
between positively selected sites to restore global stability is common.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has confirmed the predicted high incidence of positively 
selected residues in rbcL in Ilex, and shown that this is higher than in any 
other plant lineage studied so far. The causes and consequences of this high 
incidence are unclear, but it is probably associated with the similarly high 
incidence of hybridization and introgression in Ilex, even between distantly 
related lineages, resulting in large cytonuclear discordance in the phylogenies.
