Therapeutic approaches focused on the inflammatory microenvironment are 
currently gaining more support, as biomolecules involved in the inflammatory 
colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor microenvironment are being explored. We analyzed 
tumor and paired normal tissue samples from CRC patients (n = 22) whom underwent 
tumor resection surgery. We assessed 39 inflammation-involved biomolecules 
(multiplex magnetic bead-based immunoassay), CEA and CA19-9 (ELISA assay) and 
the tissue expression levels of occludin and also pErk, STAT1 and STAT3 
transcriptional factors (western blot). Tumor staging has been established by 
histopathological evaluation of HE stained tumor tissue sections. We report 32 
biomarkers displaying statistically significant differences in tumor vs. 
control. Additionally, positive statistical biomarker correlations were found 
between MMP2-IL8 and BAFF-IL8 (Pearson correlation coefficients > 0.751), while 
APRIL-MMP2, APRIL-BAFF and APRIL-IL8 were negatively correlated (correlation 
coefficients < - 0.650). While APRIL, BAFF, IL8 and MMP2 did not modulate with 
tumor stage, they were inversely related to the immune infiltrate level and 
CD163 tissue expression. We conclude that the significantly decreased APRIL and 
increased BAFF, IL8 and MMP2 expression were tumor-specific and deserve 
consideration in the development of new treatments. Also, the positive 
correlation between Chitinase 3-like 1 and IL8 (0.57) or MMP2 (0.50) suggest a 
role in tumor growth and metastasis pathways.
