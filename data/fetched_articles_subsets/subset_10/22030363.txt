Toll-like receptor 4, a central mediator of the innate immune response has been 
shown to play an important role not only in the defense mechanism against 
microorganism, but also other non-infectious inflammatory diseases such as 
atherosclerosis. The Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, which are common co-segregation 
polymorphisms of the Toll-like receptor 4 gene have been shown to be associated 
with increased susceptibility for Gram-negative infections, but with a lower 
risk of carotid atherosclerosis and a reduced level of certain proinflammatory 
cytokines.
AIM: The role of these polymorphisms in diabetes mellitus with its late 
microvascular complications, in ischemic stroke, and in chronic periodontitis 
was investigated in three independent studies.
METHODS: In all studies the alleles of both polymorphisms were detected by 
polymerase chain reaction and subsequent cleavage by restriction endonucleases 
followed by gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, heterozygote carriers of the 
Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms of the Toll-like receptor 4 gene had a 
significantly reduced prevalence of peripheral neuropathy, while there was no 
association with any other diabetic microvascular complication, or with cerebral 
ischemia or with chronic periodontitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Toll-like receptor 4 gene polymorphisms are not enough sensitive 
genetic markers for risk stratification either in diabetes mellitus or in 
cerebral ischemia or in chronic periodontitis.
