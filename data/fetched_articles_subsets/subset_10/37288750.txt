Specific HBsAg mutations are known to hamper HBsAg recognition by neutralizing 
antibodies thus challenging HBV-vaccination efficacy. Nevertheless, information 
on their impact and spreading over time is limited. Here, we characterize the 
circulation of vaccine-escape mutations from 2005 to 2019 and their correlation 
with virological parameters in a large cohort of patients infected with HBV 
genotype-D (N = 947), dominant in Europe. Overall, 17.7% of patients harbours ≥1 
vaccine-escape mutation with the highest prevalence in subgenotype-D3. Notably, 
complex profiles (characterized by ≥2 vaccine-escape mutations) are revealed in 
3.1% of patients with a prevalence rising from 0.4% in 2005-2009 to 3.0% in 
2010-2014 and 5.1% in 2015-2019 (P = 0.007) (OR[95%CI]:11.04[1.42-85.58], 
P = 0.02, by multivariable-analysis). The presence of complex profiles 
correlates with lower HBsAg-levels (median[IQR]:40[0-2905]IU/mL for complex 
profiles vs 2078[115-6037]IU/ml and 1881[410-7622]IU/mL for single or no 
vaccine-escape mutation [P < 0.02]). Even more, the presence of complex profiles 
correlates with HBsAg-negativity despite HBV-DNA positivity (HBsAg-negativity in 
34.8% with ≥2 vaccine-escape mutations vs 6.7% and 2.3% with a single or no 
vaccine-escape mutation, P < 0.007). These in-vivo findings are in keeping with 
our in-vitro results showing the ability of these mutations in hampering HBsAg 
secretion or HBsAg recognition by diagnostic antibodies. In conclusion, 
vaccine-escape mutations, single or in complex profiles, circulate in a not 
negligible fraction of HBV genotype-D infected patients with an increasing 
temporal trend, suggesting a progressive enrichment in the circulation of 
variants able to evade humoral responses. This should be considered for a proper 
clinical interpretation of HBsAg-results and for the development of novel 
vaccine formulations for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes.
