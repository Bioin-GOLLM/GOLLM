Calcium is vital to the normal functioning of multiple organ systems and its 
serum concentration is tightly regulated. Apart from CASR, the genes associated 
with serum calcium are largely unknown. We conducted a genome-wide association 
meta-analysis of 39,400 individuals from 17 population-based cohorts and 
investigated the 14 most strongly associated loci in ≤ 21,679 additional 
individuals. Seven loci (six new regions) in association with serum calcium were 
identified and replicated. Rs1570669 near CYP24A1 (P = 9.1E-12), rs10491003 
upstream of GATA3 (P = 4.8E-09) and rs7481584 in CARS (P = 1.2E-10) implicate 
regions involved in Mendelian calcemic disorders: Rs1550532 in DGKD (P = 
8.2E-11), also associated with bone density, and rs7336933 near DGKH/KIAA0564 (P 
= 9.1E-10) are near genes that encode distinct isoforms of diacylglycerol 
kinase. Rs780094 is in GCKR. We characterized the expression of these genes in 
gut, kidney, and bone, and demonstrate modulation of gene expression in bone in 
response to dietary calcium in mice. Our results shed new light on the genetics 
of calcium homeostasis.
