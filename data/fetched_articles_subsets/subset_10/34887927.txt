Embryo splitting is one of the newest developed methods in reproductive 
biotechnology. In this method, after splitting embryos in 2-, 4-, and even 
8-cell stages, every single blastomere can be developed separately, but the 
embryos are genetically identical. Embryo splitting, as an approach in 
reproductive cloning, is extensively employed in reproductive medicine studies, 
such as investigating human diseases, treating sterility, embryo donation, and 
gene therapy. In the present study, cloning in mammalians and cloning approaches 
are briefly reviewed. In addition, embryo splitting and the methods commonly 
used in embryo splitting and recent achievements in this field, as well as the 
applications of embryo splitting into livestock species, primate animals, and 
humans, are outlined. Finally, a perspective of embryo splitting is provided as 
the conclusion.
