PURPOSE: To determine whether there is an association between polymorphisms of 
the AKR1B1 gene and cortical cataract in the presence of hyperglycemia.
METHODS: In the second cross section of the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES), 
3508 participants (2334 at 5-year follow-up and 1174 newly recruited 
participants) were examined during 1997 to 2000. Cataract was graded from lens 
photographs using the Wisconsin Cataract Grading System. Fasting blood glucose 
(FBG) was measured. Continuous imputed dosages of minor alleles of 17 AKR1B1 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed for associations with 
prevalent cortical cataract. Gene-environment interactions between SNPs and FBG 
were examined. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prevalent 
cortical cataract were estimated using logistic regression adjusting for age, 
sex, smoking, hypertension, education, and myopia. A P value of 0.005 was 
considered statistically significant after correction for 10 independent tests. 
Replication of significant associations found in the BMES sample was conducted 
in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study (n = 10,033).
RESULTS: No polymorphism was associated with prevalent cortical cataract. A 
significant interaction was observed between rs9640883 and FBG (Pinteraction = 
0.004), with increased cortical cataract prevalence associated with rs9640883 
minor allele dosage in those with FBG >6.0 mM (strata-specific OR 1.72, 95% CI 
1.09-2.72). No similar association was found in participants with normal FBG (OR 
0.85, 95% CI 0.69-1.04). This interaction was not evident in the SEED study.
CONCLUSIONS: The identified interaction between rs9640883 and FBG in relation to 
cortical cataract was not replicated but may warrant further investigation.
