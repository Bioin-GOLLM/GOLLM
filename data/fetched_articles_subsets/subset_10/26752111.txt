BACKGROUND & AIMS: Molecular events that lead to recurrence and/or metastasis 
after curative treatment of patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs) are poorly 
understood. Patients with stage II or III primary CRC with elevated 
microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats and low levels of 
microsatellite instability (E/L) are more likely to have disease recurrence 
after treatment. Hypoxia and/or inflammation not only promote metastasis, but 
also induce elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide 
repeats by causing deficiency of MSH3 in the cancer cell nucleus. We aimed to 
identify genetic alterations associated with metastasis of primary colorectal 
tumors to liver and to determine their effects on survival.
METHODS: We obtained 4 sets of primary colorectal tumors and matched liver 
metastases from hospitals in Korea and Japan. Intragenic microsatellites with 
large repeats at 141 loci were examined for frame-shift mutations and/or loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) as possible consequences of MSH3 deficiency. Highly altered 
loci were examined for association with E/L in liver metastases. We analyzed 
data from 156 of the patients with stage II or III primary colorectal tumors to 
determine outcomes and whether altered loci were associated with E/L.
RESULTS: LOH at several loci at chromosome 9p24.2 (9p24.2-LOH) was associated 
with E/L in liver metastases (odds ratio = 10.5; 95% confidence interval: 
2.69-40.80; P = .0007). We found no significant difference in the frequency of 
E/L, 9p24.2-LOH, mutations in KRAS or BRAF, or the combination of E/L and 
9p24.2-LOH, between primary colorectal tumors and their matched metastases. 
Patients with stage II or III colorectal tumors with E/L and 9p24.2-LOH had 
increased survival after CRC recurrence (hazard ratio = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.12-0.50; 
P = .0001), compared with patients without with E/L and 9p24.2-LOH. E/L with 
9p24.2-LOH appeared to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival 
of patients with stage III CRC (hazard ratio = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01-0.57; P = 
.01).
CONCLUSIONS: E/L with 9p24-LOH appears to be a biomarker for less aggressive 
metastasis from stage III primary colorectal tumors.
