SOD1 is the major superoxide dismutase responsible for catalyzing dismutation of 
superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. It is well known as an 
essential antioxidant enzyme for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. SOD1 
dysregulation has been associated with many diseases, including amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), cancer, accelerated aging, and age-related diseases. 
Recent studies also revealed that SOD1 can serve as a regulatory protein in cell 
signaling, transcription, and ribosome biogenesis. Notably, SOD1 is localized in 
the nucleus under both normal and pathological conditions, contributing to 
oxidative stress response and growth control. Moreover, increasing evidence 
points to the importance of nuclear SOD1 in the pathogenesis of ALS and cancer.
