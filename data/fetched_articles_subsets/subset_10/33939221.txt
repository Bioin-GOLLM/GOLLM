Working memory is a basic human cognitive function. However, the genetic 
signatures and their biological pathway remain poorly understood. In the present 
study, we tried to clarify this issue by exploring the potential associations 
and pathways among genetic variants, brain morphometry and working memory 
performance. We first carried out association analyses between 2-back accuracy 
and 212 image-derived phenotypes from 1141 Human Connectome Project (HCP) 
subjects using a linear mixed model (LMM). We found a significantly positive 
correlation between the left cuneus volume and 2-back accuracy (T = 3.615, 
p = 3.150e-4, Cohen's d = 0.226, corrected using family-wise error [FWE] 
method). Based on the LMM-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the HCP 
dataset and UK Biobank 33 k GWAS summary statistics, we identified eight 
independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were reliably associated 
with left cuneus volume in both UKB and HCP dataset. Within the eight SNPs, we 
found a negative correlation between the rs76119478 polymorphism and 2-back 
accuracy accuracy (T = -2.045, p = .041, Cohen's d = -0.129). Finally, an 
LMM-based mediation analysis elucidated a significant effect of left cuneus 
volume in mediating rs76119478 polymorphism on the 2-back accuracy (indirect 
effect = -0.007, 95% BCa CI = [-0.045, -0.003]). These results were also 
replicated in a subgroup of Caucasians in the HCP population. Further fine 
mapping demonstrated that rs76119478 maps on intergene CTD-2315A10.2 adjacent to 
protein-encoding gene DAAM1, and is significantly associated with L3HYPDH mRNA 
expression. Our study suggested this new variant rs76119478 may regulate the 
working memory through exerting influence on the left cuneus volume.
