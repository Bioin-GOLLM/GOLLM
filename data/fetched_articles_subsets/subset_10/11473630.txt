BACKGROUND: Carriers of autosomal-recessive and X-linked Alport syndrome often 
have a thinned glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and have mutations in the 
COL4A3/COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes respectively. Recently, we have shown that many 
individuals with thin basement membrane disease (TBMD) are also from families 
where hematuria segregates with the COL4A3/COL4A4 locus. This study describes 
the first COL4A4 mutation in an individual with biopsy-proven TBMD who did not 
have a family member with autosomal-recessive or X-linked Alport syndrome, 
inherited renal failure, or deafness.
METHODS: The index case and all available family members were examined for 
dysmorphic hematuria> 50,000/mL using phase contrast microscopy and for 
segregation of hematuria with the COL4A3/COL4A4 and COL4A5 loci using DNA 
satellite markers. COL4A4 exons from the index case were then studied using the 
enzyme mismatch cleavage method, and exons that demonstrated abnormal cleavage 
products were sequenced.
RESULTS: Hematuria in this family segregated with a haplotype at the 
COL4A3/COL4A4 locus (P = 0.031) but not with haplotypes at the COL4A5 locus. A 
mutation in COL4A4 that changed C to T resulting in an arginine residue being 
replaced by a stop codon (R1377X) was demonstrated in exon 44, which encodes 
part of the alpha 4(IV) collagen sequence close to the junction with the 
noncollagenous domain. This mutation was present in all five family members with 
hematuria, but not in the four unaffected family members, 33 unrelated 
individuals with TBMD, or 22 nonhematuric normals.
CONCLUSIONS: R1377X has been described previously in a compound heterozygous 
form of autosomal-recessive Alport syndrome. Our observation is evidence that 
TBMD can represent a carrier state for autosomal-recessive Alport syndrome in at 
least some individuals.
