Members of the SLC26 family constitute a conserved class of anion transport 
proteins, which encompasses uncoupled transporters with channel-like properties, 
coupled exchangers and motor proteins. Among the 10 functional paralogs in 
humans, several participate in the secretion of bicarbonate in exchange with 
chloride and thus play an important role in maintaining pH homeostasis. 
Previously, we have elucidated the structure of murine SLC26A9 and defined its 
function as an uncoupled chloride transporter (Walter et al., 2019). Here we 
have determined the structure of the closely related human transporter SLC26A6 
and characterized it as a coupled exchanger of chloride with bicarbonate and 
presumably also oxalate. The structure defines an inward-facing conformation of 
the protein that generally resembles known structures of SLC26A9. The altered 
anion selectivity between both paralogs is a consequence of a remodeled ion 
binding site located in the center of a mobile unit of the membrane-inserted 
domain, which also accounts for differences in the coupling mechanism.
