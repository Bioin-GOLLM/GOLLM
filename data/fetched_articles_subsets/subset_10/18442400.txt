BACKGROUND: It is useful to develop a tool that would effectively describe 
protein mutation matrices specifically geared towards the identification of 
mutations that produce either wanted or unwanted effects, such as an increase or 
decrease in affinity, or a predisposition towards misfolding. Here, we describe 
a tool where such mutations are efficiently identified, categorized and 
visualized. To categorize the mutations, amino acids in a mutation matrix are 
arranged according to one of three sets of physicochemical characteristics, 
namely hydrophilicity, size and polarizability, and charge and polarity. The 
magnitude and frequencies of mutations for an alignment are subsequently 
described using color information and scaling factors.
RESULTS: To illustrate the capabilities of our approach, the technique is used 
to visualize and to compare mutation patterns in evolving sequences with 
diametrically opposite characteristics. Results show the emergence of distinct 
patterns not immediately discernible from the raw matrices.
CONCLUSION: Our technique enables effective categorization and visualization of 
mutations by using specifically-arranged mutation matrices. This tool has a 
number of possible applications in protein engineering, notably in simplifying 
the identification of mutations and/or mutation trends that are associated with 
specific engineered protein characteristics and behavior.
