The CD40 ligand (CD40L) is a transmembrane molecule of crucial interest in cell 
signaling in innate and adaptive immunity. It is expressed by a variety of 
cells, but mainly by activated T-lymphocytes and platelets. CD40L may be cleaved 
into a soluble form (sCD40L) that has a cytokine-like activity. Both forms bind 
to several receptors, including CD40. This interaction is necessary for the 
antigen specific immune response. Furthermore, CD40L and sCD40L are involved in 
inflammation and a panoply of immune related and vascular pathologies. Soluble 
CD40L is primarily produced by platelets after activation, degranulation and 
cleavage, which may present a problem for transfusion. Soluble CD40L is involved 
in adverse transfusion events including transfusion related acute lung injury 
(TRALI). Although platelet storage designed for transfusion occurs in sterile 
conditions, platelets are activated and release sCD40L without known agonists. 
Recently, proteomic studies identified signaling pathways activated in platelet 
concentrates. Soluble CD40L is a good candidate for platelet activation in an 
auto-amplification loop. In this review, we describe the immunomodulatory role 
of CD40L in physiological and pathological conditions. We will focus on the main 
signaling pathways activated by CD40L after binding to its different receptors.
