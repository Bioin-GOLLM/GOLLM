Amniotic band syndrome (ABS) is a set of congenital malformations that mainly 
affect the limbs and more rarely the skull, face, chest, and abdomen. Two main 
hypotheses have been proposed to explain the nature of the disorder: an 
intrinsic and extrinsic factor. We report a newborn with ABS presenting with 
several malformations involving both hands and foot. In this case, the 
malformative event localized at the hands and right foot without involvement of 
any other internal organs and is asymmetric which leads us to suppose the 
extrinsic factor as cause of the ABS.
