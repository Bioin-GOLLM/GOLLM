Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents around 2% of cancer-related deaths 
worldwide per year. RCC is an immunogenic malignancy, and treatment of 
metastatic RCC (mRCC) has greatly improved since the advent of the new 
immunotherapy agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, it 
should be stressed that a large proportion of patients does not respond to these 
therapies. There is thus an urgent need to identify predictive biomarkers of 
efficacy or resistance associated with ICIs or ICI/Tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI) combinations; this is a major challenge to achieve precision medicine for 
mRCC in routine practice. To identify potential biomarkers, it is necessary to 
improve our knowledge on the biology of immune checkpoints. A lot of efforts 
have been made over the last decade in the field of immuno-oncology. We 
summarize here the main data obtained in this field when considering mRCC. As 
for clinical biomarkers, clinician and scientific experts of the domain are 
facing difficulties in identifying such molecular entities, probably due to the 
complexity of immuno-oncology and the constant adaptation of tumor cells to 
their changing environment.
