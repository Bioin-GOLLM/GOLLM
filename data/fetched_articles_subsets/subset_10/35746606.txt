Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is a novel mono-pegylated and extra-long-acting 
interferon, being developed for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasm 
(MPN) and chronic viral hepatitis. It has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile 
and less frequent dosing schedule, i.e., once every two to four weeks, compared 
to conventional pegylated interferon products, which have multiple isomers and 
are administered weekly. It was approved for the long-term treatment of 
polycythemia vera, an MPN, and has been included in the NCCN clinical practice 
guidelines for this indication. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b has demonstrated 
efficacy and showed a favorable safety profile for the treatment of chronic 
viral hepatitis in several clinical studies. In this article, we review its 
pharmacokinetics and available clinical data and suggest that ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b administered once every two weeks can serve as a new treatment option 
for patients with chronic viral hepatitis, including chronic hepatitis B, C, and 
D.
