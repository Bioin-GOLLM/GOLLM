The amplitude of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signal is tightly 
regulated to ensure appropriate physiological responses. As part of negative 
feedback loop SMAD7, a direct transcriptional target of downstream TGF-β 
signaling acts as a scaffold to recruit the E3 ligase SMURF2 to target the TGF-β 
receptor complex for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Here, we identify the 
deubiquitinating enzyme USP26 as a novel integral component of this negative 
feedback loop. We demonstrate that TGF-β rapidly enhances the expression of 
USP26 and reinforces SMAD7 stability by limiting the ubiquitin-mediated turnover 
of SMAD7. Conversely, knockdown of USP26 rapidly degrades SMAD7 resulting in 
TGF-β receptor stabilization and enhanced levels of p-SMAD2. Clinically, loss of 
USP26 correlates with high TGF-β activity and confers poor prognosis in 
glioblastoma. Our data identify USP26 as a novel negative regulator of the TGF-β 
pathway and suggest that loss of USP26 expression may be an important factor in 
glioblastoma pathogenesis.
