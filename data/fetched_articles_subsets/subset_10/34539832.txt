Kidney disease affects millions of people worldwide and is a financial burden on 
the healthcare system. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is involved in renal 
development and the function of ion-transport proteins, aquaporin-2 and 
podocytes, is likely to serve an important role in renal processes. PP2A is 
associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of different kidney diseases 
including podocyte injury, inflammation, tumors and chronic kidney disease. The 
current review aimed to discuss the structure and function of PP2A subunits in 
the context of kidney diseases. How dysregulation of PP2A in the kidneys causes 
podocyte death and the inactivation of PP2A in renal carcinoma tissues is 
discussed. Inhibition of PP2A activity prevents epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition and attenuates renal fibrosis, creating a favorable inflammatory 
microenvironment and promoting the initiation and progression of tumor 
pathogenesis. The current review also indicates that PP2A serves an important 
role in protection against renal inflammation. Understanding the detailed 
mechanisms of PP2A provides information that can be utilized in the design and 
application of novel therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of renal 
diseases.
