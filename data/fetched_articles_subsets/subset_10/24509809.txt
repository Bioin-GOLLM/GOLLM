Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is a global public health problem affecting 
over 160 million individuals worldwide. Its symptoms include chronic hepatitis, 
liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is an enveloped RNA virus 
mainly targeting liver cells and for which the initiation of infection occurs 
through a complex multistep process involving a series of specific cellular 
entry factors. This process is likely mediated through the formation of a 
tightly orchestrated complex of HCV entry factors at the plasma membrane. Among 
HCV entry factors, the tetraspanin CD81 is one of the best characterized and it 
is undoubtedly a key player in the HCV lifecycle. In this review, we detail the 
current knowledge on the involvement of CD81 in the HCV lifecycle, as well as in 
the immune response to HCV infection.
