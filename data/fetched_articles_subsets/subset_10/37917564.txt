Spodoptera frugiperda is a highly destructive migratory pest that threatens 
various crops globally. Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 
(AcMNPV) is an effective biocontrol agent against lepidopteran pests. Here, we 
explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to AcMNPV 
infection in S. frugiperda. RNA-seq and quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses identified the Toll, 
IMD, and apoptosis pathways as primary immune responses. Investigation into 
AcMNPV-induced apoptosis in the S. frugiperda cell line (Sf9) revealed that the 
Toll pathway activated the JNK via the TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) 
adapter. In addition, AcMNPV-induced the differential expression of several 
host-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs), with significant negative regulatory effects, 
on S. frugiperda antiviral immune genes. RNAi and miRNA-mimic mediated silencing 
of these genes resulted in increased AcMNPV proliferation. Our findings 
reinforce the potential of AcMNPV as a potent biocontrol agent and further our 
understanding of developing biotechnology-based targeted pest control agents.
