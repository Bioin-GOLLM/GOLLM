OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of 8-hydroxyguanine glycosidase OGG1 
Ser326Cys polymorphism with semen quality and the risk of male infertility.
METHODS: This case-control study included 620 idiopathic infertile patients and 
385 normal fertile controls. We determined their genotypes by polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and analyzed their 
semen quality by computer-aided semen analysis (CASA).
RESULTS: The individuals with OGG1 326 Cys/Cys showed significantly lower sperm 
motility and concentration ([52.1 +/- 26.7]% and (3.75 +/- 0.91) x 10(6)/ml, ln 
transformed value) than the Ser/Ser carriers ([59.0 +/- 21.8] % and (4.12 +/- 
0.88) x 10(6)/ml, ln transformed value) (P < 0.05). The risk of male infertility 
increased 69% in the OGG1 326Cys allele carriers as compared with the Ser 
carriers (OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.24 -2.31).
CONCLUSION: OGG1 326 Ser/Cys polymorphism might contribute to the risk of male 
infertility in the southern Chinese population.
