X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (RS) is a bilateral vitreoretinal disorder with 
no known cure. The gene responsible for the disease was recently isolated by 
positional cloning methods and a spectrum of mutations has been described in 
families with RS pathology. In this report, we screened six sporadic cases of RS 
for mutations in the RS gene to understand the etiology of isolated cases. Our 
extensive studies revealed a novel 4 bp insertion in one family and the 
remaining families did not show mutations in the RS gene. This mutation altered 
the reading frame including codon 55 resulting in nine aberrant amino acid 
residues. The unaffected mother did not contain this mutation. Additionally, it 
was not found in 60 normal control chromosomes, suggesting that the insertion 
mutation is disease related in the family analyzed.
