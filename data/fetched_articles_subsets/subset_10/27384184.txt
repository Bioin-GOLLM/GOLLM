BACKGROUND: In human cirrhosis, adrenergic hyperfunction causes proximal tubular 
fluid retention and contributes to diuretic-resistant ascites, and clonidine, a 
sympatholytic drug, improves natriuresis in difficult-to-treat ascites.
AIM: To compare clonidine (aspecific α2-adrenoceptor agonist) to SSP-002021R 
(prodrug of guanfacine, specific α2A-receptor agonist), both associated with 
diuretics, in experimental cirrhotic ascites.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Six groups of 12 rats were studied: controls (G1); controls 
receiving furosemide and potassium canrenoate (G2); rats with ascitic cirrhosis 
due to 14-week CCl4 treatment (G3); cirrhotic rats treated (over the 11th-14th 
CCl4 weeks) with furosemide and canrenoate (G4), furosemide, canrenoate and 
clonidine (G5), or diuretics and SSP002021R (G6). Three rats of each group had 
their hormonal status and renal function assessed at the end of 11th, 12th, 
13th, and 14th weeks of respective treatments.Cirrhotic rats in G3 and G4 gained 
weight over the 12th-14th CCl4 weeks. In G4, brief increase in sodium excretion 
over the 11th-12th weeks preceded worsening of inulin clearance and natriuresis 
(diuretic resistance). In comparison with G4, the addition of clonidine (G5) or 
guanfacine (G6) to diuretics improved, respectively, sodium excretion over the 
11th-12th CCl4 weeks, or GFR and electrolytes excretion over the 13th-14th CCl4 
weeks. Natriuretic responses in G5 and G6 were accompanied by reduced 
catecholamine serum levels.
CONCLUSIONS: α2A-receptor agonists restore glomerular filtration rate and 
natriuresis, and delay diuretic-resistant ascites in experimental advanced 
cirrhosis. Clonidine ameliorates diuretic-dependent natriuresis just for a short 
time.
