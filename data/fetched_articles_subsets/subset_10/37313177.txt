BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: and purpose: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
is a significant global health concern with limited pharmacotherapy options. 
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a standardized extract of 
Phyllanthus niruri in mild-to-moderate NAFLD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a 12-month randomized controlled trial, in which 
adults with a controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score >250 dB/m and a 
fibrosis score <10 kPa were randomly assigned to receive a standardized P. 
niruri extract at a dose of 3,000 mg daily (n = 112) or a placebo (n = 114). The 
primary outcomes were changes in CAP score and liver enzyme levels, while the 
secondary outcomes were changes in other metabolic parameters. The analysis was 
performed on an intention-to-treat basis.
RESULTS: After 12 months, there was no significant difference in the change of 
CAP score between the intervention and control groups (-15.05 ± 36.76 dB/m vs. 
-14.74 ± 41.08 dB/m; p = 0.869). There was also no significant difference in the 
changes of liver enzyme levels between the two groups. However, the intervention 
group showed a significant reduction in fibrosis score, which was not observed 
in the control group (-0.64 ± 1.66 kPa versus 0.10 ± 1.61 kPa; p = 0.001). No 
major adverse events were reported in either group.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that P. niruri did not significantly reduce CAP 
score and liver enzyme levels in patients with mild-to-moderate NAFLD. However, 
a significant improvement in fibrosis score was observed. Further research is 
needed to determine its clinical benefits at different dosages for NAFLD 
treatment.
