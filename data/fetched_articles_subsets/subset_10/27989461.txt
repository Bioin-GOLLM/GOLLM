Ingestion of water and food are major hypo- and hyperosmotic challenges. To 
protect the body from osmotic stress, posterior pituitary-projecting, 
vasopressin-secreting neurons (VPpp neurons) counter osmotic perturbations by 
altering their release of vasopressin, which controls renal water excretion. 
Vasopressin levels begin to fall within minutes of water consumption, even prior 
to changes in blood osmolality. To ascertain the precise temporal dynamics by 
which water or food ingestion affect VPpp neuron activity, we directly recorded 
the spiking and calcium activity of genetically defined VPpp neurons. In states 
of elevated osmolality, water availability rapidly decreased VPpp neuron 
activity within seconds, beginning prior to water ingestion, upon presentation 
of water-predicting cues. In contrast, food availability following food 
restriction rapidly increased VPpp neuron activity within seconds, but only 
following feeding onset. These rapid and distinct changes in activity during 
drinking and feeding suggest diverse neural mechanisms underlying anticipatory 
regulation of VPpp neurons.
