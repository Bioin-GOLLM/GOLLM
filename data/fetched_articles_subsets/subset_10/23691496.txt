Objective. It has been stated that brain cancers are an increasingly serious 
issue in many parts of the world. The aim of our study was to determine a 
possible relationship between Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and 
the risk of glioma and meningioma. Methods. We investigated the VDR Taq-I and 
VDR Fok-I gene polymorphisms in 100 brain cancer patients (including 44 
meningioma cases and 56 glioma cases) and 122 age-matched healthy control 
subjects. This study was performed by polymerase chain reaction-based 
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RF LP). Results. VDR Fok-I ff genotype 
was significantly increased in meningioma patients (15.9%) compared with 
controls (2.5%), and carriers of Fok-I ff genotype had a 6.47-fold increased 
risk for meningioma cases. There was no significant difference between patients 
and controls for VDR Taq-I genotypes and alleles. Conclusions. We suggest that 
VDR Fok-I genotypes might affect the development of meningioma.
