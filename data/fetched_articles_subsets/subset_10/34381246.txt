CRISPR-CasΦ, a small RNA-guided enzyme found uniquely in bacteriophages, 
achieves programmable DNA cutting as well as genome editing. To investigate how 
the hypercompact enzyme recognizes and cleaves double-stranded DNA, we 
determined cryo-EM structures of CasΦ (Cas12j) in pre- and post-DNA-binding 
states. The structures reveal a streamlined protein architecture that tightly 
encircles the CRISPR RNA and DNA target to capture, unwind and cleave DNA. 
Comparison of the pre- and post-DNA-binding states reveals how the protein 
rearranges for DNA cleavage upon target recognition. On the basis of these 
structures, we created and tested mutant forms of CasΦ that cut DNA up to 
20-fold faster relative to wild type, showing how this system may be naturally 
attenuated to improve the fidelity of DNA interference. The structural and 
mechanistic insights into how CasΦ binds and cleaves DNA should allow for 
protein engineering for both in vitro diagnostics and genome editing.
