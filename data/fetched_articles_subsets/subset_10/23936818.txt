In this study the transcriptomic profiling of adenosine receptors (ARs) in human 
leukocytes of heart failure (HF) patients as a function of clinical severity, 
assessing the possible changes with respect to healthy subjects (C), was 
evaluated. Total RNA was extracted from leukocytes of C (n = 8) and of HF 
patients (NYHA I-II n = 9; NYHA III-IV n = 14) with a PAXgene Blood RNA Kit. An 
increase as a function of clinical severity was observed in each AR (A1R: C = 
0.02 ± 0.009, NYHA I-II = 0.21 ± 0.09, NYHA III-IV = 3.6 ± 1.3, P = 0.03 C 
versus NYHA III-IV, P = 0.02 NYHA I-II versus NYHA III-IV; A2aR: C = 0.2 ± 0.05, 
NYHA I-II = 0.19 ± 0.04, NYHA III-IV = 1.32 ± 0.33, P = 0.005 C versus NYHA 
III-IV, P = 0.003 NYHA I-II versus NYHA III-IV; A2bR: C = 1.78 ± 0.36, NYHA I-II 
= 1.35 ± 0.29, NYHA III-IV = 4.07 ± 1.21, P = 0.03: NYHA I-II versus NYHA 
III-IV; A3R: C = 0.76 ± 0.21, NYHA I-II = 0.94 ± 0.19, NYHA III-IV = 3.14 ± 
0.77, P = 0.01 C versus NYHA III-IV and NYHA I-II versus NYHA III-IV, resp.). 
The mRNA expression of the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (CD39) 
and the ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) were also evaluated. They resulted 
up-regulated. These findings show that components of adenosine metabolism and 
signalling are altered to promote adenosine production and signalling in HF 
patients. Thus, HF may benefit from adenosine-based drug therapy after 
confirmation by clinical trials.
