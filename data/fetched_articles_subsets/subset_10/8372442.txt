The bipartite geminiviruses causing squash leaf curl disease, SqLCV-E and 
SqLCV-R, have a broad host range that includes Nicotiana benthamiana, pumpkin, 
squash, and beans. We have characterized a naturally occurring mutant of the 
SqLCV-R B component (BRtd1) which has lost the ability to infect N. benthamiana, 
but still retains full infectivity for pumpkin and squash. The mutation 
responsible for this host range alteration was localized to the coding region of 
BR1, a gene essential for viral movement. Sequence analysis identified three 
missense mutations in the BR1 gene encoded by BRtd1. By site-directed 
mutagenesis, one of these missense mutations, a substitution of Cys for Arg at 
position 98 in the BR1 protein, has been identified as responsible for the 
altered host range properties of BRtd1. These results establish a role for the 
BR1 movement protein in determining the host range properties of SqLCV.
