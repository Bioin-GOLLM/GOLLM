Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR chloride channel and is in worldwide 
clinical use for the chronic treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients. There is 
evidence that the bioavailability of ivacaftor in the body may be influenced by 
the multi-drug exporter P-glycoprotein. Here we have employed purified and 
reconstituted P-glycoprotein to study its interaction with ivacaftor as well as 
the ability of the drug to compete with a known transported substrate of the 
protein. We find that ivacaftor stimulates the ATPase activity of the purified 
protein and can compete with the transport of the fluorescent substrate Hoechst 
33342. These findings lead us to conclude that ivacaftor is very likely an 
efficiently transported substrate of P-glycoprotein. Evidence for 
state-dependent binding of ivacaftor was obtained using a fluorescent, 
cysteine-reactive reporter dye. The quiescent, nucleotide-free state in the 
P-glycoprotein transport cycle appears to bind ivacaftor strongly.
