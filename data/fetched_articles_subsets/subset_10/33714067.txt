CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) is a rare X-linked monogenic developmental 
encephalopathy that is estimated to affect 1:42,000 live births. CDD is caused 
by pathogenic variants in the CDKL5 gene and is observed in both male and female 
patients. Here, we report the generation and characterization of induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from fibroblasts of six unrelated CDD 
patients-three males and three females. These patients are clinically diagnosed 
to present with classic CDD phenotypes, including refractory epilepsy and global 
developmental delay, and are being followed in a longitudinal clinical study.
