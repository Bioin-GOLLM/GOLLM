Tautomerase superfamily members have an amino-terminal proline and a 
beta-alpha-beta fold, and include 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT), 
5-(carboxymethyl)-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase (CHMI), trans- and 
cis-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase (CaaD and cis-CaaD, respectively), 
malonate semialdehyde decarboxylase (MSAD), and macrophage migration inhibitory 
factor (MIF), which exhibits a phenylpyruvate tautomerase (PPT) activity. Pro-1 
is a base (4-OT, CHMI, the PPT activity of MIF) or an acid (CaaD, cis-CaaD, 
MSAD). Components of the catalytic machinery have been identified and 
mechanistic hypotheses formulated. Characterization of new homologues shows that 
these mechanisms are incomplete. 4-OT, CaaD, cis-CaaD, and MSAD also have 
promiscuous activities with a hydratase activity in CaaD, cis-CaaD, and MSAD, 
PPT activity in CaaD and cis-CaaD, and CaaD and cis-CaaD activities in 4-OT. The 
shared promiscuous activities provide evidence for divergent evolution from a 
common ancestor, give hints about mechanistic relationships, and implicate 
catalytic promiscuity in the emergence of new enzymes.
