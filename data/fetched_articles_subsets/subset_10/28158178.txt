Pattern formation during development is a highly dynamic process. In spite of 
this, few experimental and modelling approaches take into account the explicit 
time-dependence of the rules governing regulatory systems. We address this 
problem by studying dynamic morphogen interpretation by the gap gene network in 
Drosophila melanogaster. Gap genes are involved in segment determination during 
early embryogenesis. They are activated by maternal morphogen gradients encoded 
by bicoid (bcd) and caudal (cad). These gradients decay at the same time-scale 
as the establishment of the antero-posterior gap gene pattern. We use a 
reverse-engineering approach, based on data-driven regulatory models called gene 
circuits, to isolate and characterise the explicitly time-dependent effects of 
changing morphogen concentrations on gap gene regulation. To achieve this, we 
simulate the system in the presence and absence of dynamic gradient decay. 
Comparison between these simulations reveals that maternal morphogen decay 
controls the timing and limits the rate of gap gene expression. In the anterior 
of the embyro, it affects peak expression and leads to the establishment of 
smooth spatial boundaries between gap domains. In the posterior of the embryo, 
it causes a progressive slow-down in the rate of gap domain shifts, which is 
necessary to correctly position domain boundaries and to stabilise the spatial 
gap gene expression pattern. We use a newly developed method for the analysis of 
transient dynamics in non-autonomous (time-variable) systems to understand the 
regulatory causes of these effects. By providing a rigorous mechanistic 
explanation for the role of maternal gradient decay in gap gene regulation, our 
study demonstrates that such analyses are feasible and reveal important aspects 
of dynamic gene regulation which would have been missed by a traditional 
steady-state approach. More generally, it highlights the importance of transient 
dynamics for understanding complex regulatory processes in development.
