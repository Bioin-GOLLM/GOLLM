CD163 and sialoadhesin (SN) were reported as two essential receptors for the 
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. To investigate the 
relationship between these two genes and porcine immunity, we assigned porcine 
CD163 and SN respectively to SSC5q21-q24 and SSC17q23 by IMpRH. Expression 
profiles revealed that CD163 and SN were ubiquitously expressed in ten tissues, 
and were expressed highly in lymph gland, spleen and liver, which implied the 
potential functions of CD163 and SN in immunity. Moreover, a single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) c.3534C>T was found in 3'-UTR of the CD163 gene and 
association analysis showed that this gene was significantly associated with the 
IgG content in blood (P < 0.05). A novel missense mutation c.878A>G located in 
exon4 of the SN gene which caused the amino acid transition from histidine to 
arginine was detected, and it was significantly associated with the WBC count in 
the peripheral blood (P < 0.05). These results provided fundamental evidence for 
CD163 and SN as two functional candidate genes affecting immunity in pigs.
