Dietary therapy is the mainstay of treatment for diabetes. This study examined 
the effect of a low glycemic index (GI) multi-nutrient supplement, consumed in 
place of breakfast, on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM). A total of 71 participants were randomized at a 2:1 ratio into 
either a breakfast replacement group or a normal breakfast group for a 12-week 
interventional study. The primary outcome measure was change in hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c). Nutrition status and somatometry were studied as secondary outcomes. 
The breakfast replacement group displayed a -0.2% absolute reduction in HbA1c 
(95% CI (confidence interval), -0.38% to -0.07%, p = 0.004), while the HbA1c of 
the control group increased 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1% to 0.5%, p = 0.005). The baseline 
Mini Nutritional Assessment score for both groups was 26.0 and no significant 
changes occurred following intervention. However, there was a statistically 
significant difference in body mass index between the treatment and control 
groups (p = 0.032) due to the weight gain in the control group (increased 0.5 
kg, 95% CI was 0.2 to 0.9, p = 0.007). These data suggest that breakfast 
replacement with a low GI multi-nutrient supplement can improve glycemic and 
weight control in T2DM.
