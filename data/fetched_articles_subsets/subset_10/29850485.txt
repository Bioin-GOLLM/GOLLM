OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and distribution of ABO and Rh (D) 
antigens and, additionally, investigate gene diversity and the structure of 
Mexican populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood groups were tested in 271,164 subjects from 2014 to 
2016. The ABO blood group was determined by agglutination using the antibodies 
anti-A, Anti-B, and Anti-D for the Rh factor, respectively.
RESULTS: The overall distribution of ABO and Rh (D) groups in the population 
studied was as follows: O: 61.82%; A: 27.44%; B: 8.93%; and AB: 1.81%. For the 
Rh group, 95.58% of people were Rh (D), and 4.42% were Rh (d). Different 
distributions of blood groups across regions were found; additionally, genetic 
analysis revealed that the IO and ID allele showed an increasing trend from the 
north to the center, while the IA and Id allele tended to increase from the 
center to the north. Also, we found more gene diversity in both loci in the 
north compared with the center, suggesting population structure in Mexico.
CONCLUSION: This work could help health institutions to identify where they can 
obtain blood products necessary for medical interventions. Moreover, this piece 
of information contributes to the knowledge of the genetic structure of the 
Mexican populations which could have significant implications in different 
fields of biomedicine.
