Anthopleurin-A (AP-A) is a member of a family of sea anemone-derived 
polypeptides that interact with sodium channels in a voltage-dependent manner, 
producing a positive inotropic effect on the mammalian heart. There has been 
considerable interest in this molecule as a lead compound for the development of 
novel therapeutic agents. Earlier attempts to define the 3-dimensional structure 
of AP-A were complicated by the fact that it was found to exist in 2 
conformations in solution. Using 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, we have now shown 
that this conformational heterogeneity arises from cis-trans isomerization about 
the Gly 40-Pro 41 peptide bond and that in the major form of the protein this 
peptide bond adopts a cis conformation. Furthermore, the increased sensitivity 
afforded by higher-field NMR has allowed identification of additional minor 
conformations of AP-A, the origin of which is presently unknown. We believe 
there will be many more examples of the detection by high-field NMR of 
previously unobserved minor conformations of proteins in solution.
