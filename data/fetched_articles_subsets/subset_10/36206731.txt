Population-based studies to identify disease-associated risk alleles typically 
require samples from a large number of individuals. Here, we report a 
human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based screening strategy to link 
human genetics with viral infectivity. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
identified a cluster of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 
cis-regulatory region of the NDUFA4 gene, which was associated with 
susceptibility to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Loss of NDUFA4 led to decreased 
sensitivity to ZIKV, dengue virus, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Isogenic hiPSC 
lines carrying non-risk alleles of SNPs or deletion of the cis-regulatory region 
lower sensitivity to viral infection. Mechanistic studies indicated that 
loss/reduction of NDUFA4 causes mitochondrial stress, which leads to the leakage 
of mtDNA and thereby upregulation of type I interferon signaling. This study 
provides proof-of-principle for the application of iPSC arrays in GWAS and 
identifies NDUFA4 as a previously unknown susceptibility locus for viral 
infection.
