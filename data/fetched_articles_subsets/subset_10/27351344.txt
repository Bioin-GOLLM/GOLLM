Solute carrier (SLC) transporters represent 52 families of membrane transport 
proteins that function in endogenous compound homeostasis and xenobiotic 
disposition, and have been exploited in drug delivery and therapeutic targeting 
strategies. In particular, the SLC16 family that encodes for the 14 isoforms of 
the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family plays a significant role in the 
absorption, tissue distribution, and clearance of both endogenous and exogenous 
compounds. MCTs are required for the transport of essential cell nutrients and 
for cellular metabolic and pH regulation. Recent publications have indicated 
their novel roles in disease, and thus their potential as biomarkers and new 
therapeutic targets in disease are under investigation. More research into MCT 
isoform function, specificity, expression, and regulation will allow researchers 
to exploit the potential utility of MCTs in the clinic as therapeutic targets 
and prognostic factors of disease.
