Designing optimized proteins is important for a range of practical applications. 
Protein design is a rapidly developing field that would benefit from approaches 
that enable many changes in the amino acid primary sequence, rather than a small 
number of mutations, while maintaining structure and enhancing function. 
Homologous protein sequences contain extensive information about various protein 
properties and activities that have emerged over billions of years of evolution. 
Evolutionary models of sequence co-variation, derived from a set of homologous 
sequences, have proven effective in a range of applications including structure 
determination and mutation effect prediction. In this work we apply one of these 
models (EVcouplings) to computationally design highly divergent variants of the 
model protein TEM-1 Î²-lactamase, and characterize these designs experimentally 
using multiple biochemical and biophysical assays. Nearly all designed variants 
were functional, including one with 84 mutations from the nearest natural 
homolog. Surprisingly, all functional designs had large increases in 
thermostability and most had a broadening of available substrates. These 
property enhancements occurred while maintaining a nearly identical structure to 
the wild type enzyme. Collectively, this work demonstrates that evolutionary 
models of sequence co-variation (1) are able to capture complex epistatic 
interactions that successfully guide large sequence departures from natural 
contexts, and (2) can be applied to generate functional diversity useful for 
many applications in protein design.
