PURPOSE: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved biological pathway that 
plays a key role in maintaining genomic stability. MMR has been reported as a 
prognostic marker in certain cancers; however, the results are controversial. 
Therefore, identification of the prognostic value of MMR genes in ovarian cancer 
based on a large sample size is pivotal.
METHODS: In the current study, we systemically investigated the prognostic roles 
of seven MMR genes, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, MLH1, MLH3, PMS1 and PMS2, in ovarian 
cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy through "The 
Kaplan-Meier plotter" (KM plotter) database, which contains gene expression data 
and survival information of ovarian cancer patients.
RESULTS: Among seven MMR genes, high mRNA levels of MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2 were 
significantly associated with a better overall survival for all ovarian cancer 
patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, especially in late-stage and 
poor-differentiated ovarian cancer patients. Increased MSH6 and PMS2 mRNA 
expression was correlated with a favorable overall survival in serous ovarian 
cancer patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that sufficient MMR system is associated with 
an improved survival in ovarian cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. 
MMR gene may be a potential prognosis predictor in ovarian cancer.
