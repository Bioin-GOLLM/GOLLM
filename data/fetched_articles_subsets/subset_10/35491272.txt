PURPOSE: Mutations in ASPM are the most common causes of primary microcephaly 
(MCPH), which is a rare brain developmental disorder with few studies in Chinese 
population so far. This study aimed to identify the common pathogenic variants 
of ASPM and estimated the incidence of MCPH5 in Guangxi population.
METHODS: We ascertained six MCPH cases caused by ASPM mutations in Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Region, Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to uncover 
the causal variants. The haplotype analysis was used to estimate the age of the 
recurrent variation.
RESULTS: Five different pathogenic variants were identified in this batch of 
MCPH5 cases, including two novel variants p.Ser842fs*9 and p.Lys1340Argfs*29. An 
rarely reported pathogenic variant, c.1789C>T/p.Arg597* was found to be a 
founder mutation in local population. We evaluated all ASPM variants detected 
among 2674 non-microcephalic individuals and estimated the MCPH5 incidence to be 
5.03/1,000,000 in Guangxi population.
CONCLUSIONS: We reported the first case series of Chinese MCPH cases with ASPM 
mutation and revealed a highly recurrent founder mutation in this local 
population. MCPH5 may be the major type of congenital microcephaly in Chinese 
population.
