Previously, we reported a FLucN-LXXLL+LBD-FLucC system that detects VDR ligands 
using split firefly luciferase techniques, ligand binding domain (LBD) of VDR, 
and LXXLL sequences that interact with LBD after VDR ligand binding. In vivo, 
25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3) act 
as VDR ligands that bind to VDR, and regulate bone-related gene expression. 
Therefore, the amount of 25(OH)D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 are indicators of 
bone-related diseases such as rickets and osteoporosis. In this study, we have 
developed a novel LgBiT-LXXLL+LBD-SmBiT system using NanoLuc Binary Technology 
(NanoBiT), which has an emission intensity several times higher than that of the 
split-type firefly luciferase. Furthermore, by using genetic engineering 
techniques, we attempted to construct a novel system that can specifically 
detect 1α,25(OH)2D3. Because histidine residues at positions 305 and 397 play 
important roles in forming a hydrogen bond with a hydroxyl group at position C25 
of 25(OH)D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3, His305 and His397 were each substituted by other 
amino acids. Consequently, the three mutant VDRs, H305D, H397N, and H397E were 
equally useful to detect 1α,25(OH)2D3 specifically. In addition, among the 58 
variants of the LXXLL sequences, LPYEGSLLLKLLRAPVEE showed the greatest increase 
in luminescence upon the addition of 25(OH)D3 or 1α,25(OH)2D3. Thus, our novel 
system using NanoBiT appear to be useful for detecting native vitamin D or its 
derivatives.
