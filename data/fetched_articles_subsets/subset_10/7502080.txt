The arginine residue at position 586 of the GluR-B subunit renders heteromeric 
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-sensitive glutamate 
receptor channels impermeable to calcium. The codon for this arginine is 
introduced at the precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) stage by site-selective 
adenosine editing of a glutamine codon. Heterozygous mice engineered by gene 
targeting to harbor an editing-incompetent GluR-B allele synthesized unedited 
GluR-B subunits and, in principal neurons and interneurons, expressed AMPA 
receptors with increased calcium permeability. These mice developed seizures and 
died by 3 weeks of age, showing that GluR-B pre-mRNA editing is essential for 
brain function.
