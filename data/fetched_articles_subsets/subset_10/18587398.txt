Here we investigated the involvement of HS1, the hematopoietic cell-specific 
homolog of cortactin, in the actin-based functions of natural killer cells. 
Involvement of HS1 in T cell regulation has been established, as HS1 is required 
for the formation of immune synapses. 'Knockdown' of HS1 in natural killer cells 
resulted in defective lysis of target cells, cell adhesion, chemotaxis and actin 
assembly at the lytic synapse. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue at 
position 397 (Tyr397) was required for adhesion to the integrin ligand ICAM-1 
and for cytolysis, whereas phosphorylation of Tyr378 was required for 
chemotaxis. Phosphorylation of Tyr397 was also required for integrin signaling 
and recruitment of integrins, adaptors and actin to the lytic synapse. Thus, HS1 
is essential for signaling and actin assembly in natural killer cells, and the 
functions of the two phosphorylated tyrosine residues are distinct and 
separable.
