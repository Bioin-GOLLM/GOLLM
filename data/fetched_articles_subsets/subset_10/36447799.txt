Pseudo hypoaldosteronism (PHA) is a type of channelopathy leading to 
life-threatening hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis in neonates. 
Type I PHA (PHAI) is characterized by either mutation in NR3C2 (MLR) gene or 
genes related to subunit of ENaC channel, whereas Type II (A to E) PHA is due to 
mutations in other genes. Type I PHA is further divided into systemic and renal 
forms based on the gene and organ involved. Systemic PHAI is a rare, multisystem 
disease presenting as severe salt wasting in neonates. In this article, we 
report a case of systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 in a 2 days old neonate 
with a novel mutation involving SCNN1B gene. Our patient appears to be the first 
reported case of systemic PHAI due to SCNN1B mutation from India.
