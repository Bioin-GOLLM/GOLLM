PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to estimate analytic sensitivity and 
specificity of HFE testing for C282Y homozygosity in the hypothetical setting of 
population screening for hemochromatosis.
METHODS: We analyzed published results of the Molecular Genetics Survey 
performed by the American College of Medical Genetics/College of American 
Pathologists between 1998 and 2002, taking into account its educational nature.
RESULTS: Analytic sensitivity for C282Y homozygosity is 98.4% (95% CI 
95.9%-99.5%). The analytic specificity is 99.8% (99.4%-99.9%). At a frequency of 
40 per 10,000 for the homozygous genotype, the analytic positive predictive 
value is 66%.
CONCLUSION: HFE testing for C282Y homozygosity is highly reliable. Homozygosity 
is uncommon in population screening, however, and confirmatory testing should be 
considered.
