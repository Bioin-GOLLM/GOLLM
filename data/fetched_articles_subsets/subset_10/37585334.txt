Endothelial cell interactions with their extracellular matrix are essential for 
vascular homeostasis and expansion. Large-scale proteomic analyses aimed at 
identifying components of integrin adhesion complexes have revealed the presence 
of several RNA binding proteins (RBPs) of which the functions at these sites 
remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the role of the RBP SAM68 (Src 
associated in mitosis, of 68 kDa) in endothelial cells. We found that SAM68 is 
transiently localized at the edge of spreading cells where it participates in 
membrane protrusive activity and the conversion of nascent adhesions to 
mechanically loaded focal adhesions by modulation of integrin signaling and 
local delivery of β-actin mRNA. Furthermore, SAM68 depletion impacts cell-matrix 
interactions and motility through induction of key matrix genes involved in 
vascular matrix assembly. In a 3D environment SAM68-dependent functions in both 
tip and stalk cells contribute to the process of sprouting angiogenesis. 
Altogether, our results identify the RBP SAM68 as a novel actor in the dynamic 
regulation of blood vessel networks.
