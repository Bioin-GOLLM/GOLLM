Follicular helper T cells (TFH) are critical for vaccine and infection 
elicitation of long-lived humoral immunity, but exaggerated TFH responses can 
promote autoimmunity and other pathologies. It is unfortunate that no clinical 
interventions exist for the selective depletion of follicular T cells to 
alleviate these diseases. We engineered a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
facilitating the specific targeting of cells with high expression levels of 
human programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), a cardinal feature of follicular T 
cells. CAR-expressing human natural killer (NK) cells robustly and 
discriminately eliminated PD-1high follicular human T cells in vitro and in a 
humanized mouse model of lupus-like disease while sparing B cells and other 
PD-1low T cell subsets, including regulatory T cells. These results establish a 
strategy for specific targeting of PD-1high T cells that can be advanced as a 
clinical tool for the selective depletion of pathogenic follicular T cells or 
other PD-1high target cells in certain disease states.
