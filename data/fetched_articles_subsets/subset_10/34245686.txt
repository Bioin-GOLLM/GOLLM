Astrocytes play an essential role in the development of neural circuits by 
positioning transporters and receptors near synapses and secreting factors that 
promote synaptic maturation. However, the mechanisms that coordinate astrocyte 
and neural maturation remain poorly understood. Using in vivo imaging in 
unanesthetized neonatal mice, we show that bursts of neuronal activity passing 
through nascent sound processing networks reliably induce calcium transients in 
astrocytes. Astrocyte transients were dependent on intense neuronal activity and 
constrained to regions near active synapses, ensuring close spatial and temporal 
coordination of neuron and astrocyte activity. Astrocyte responses were 
restricted to the pre-hearing period and induced by synergistic activation of 
two metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR5 and mGluR3, which promoted 
IP3R2-dependent calcium release from intracellular stores. The widespread 
expression of these receptors by astrocytes during development and the 
prominence of neuronal burst firing in emerging neural networks may help 
coordinate the maturation of excitatory synapses.
