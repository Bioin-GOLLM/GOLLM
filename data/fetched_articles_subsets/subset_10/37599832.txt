Asthma is a global chronic airway disease. The expression and role of RNF125, an 
E3 ubiquitin ligase, in asthma remain uncertain. In this study, we revealed that 
RNF125 was downregulated in the bronchial epithelium of mice and patients with 
asthma. Rnf125 hypermethylation was responsible for the low expression of RNF125 
in primary airway epithelial cells of mice treated with OVA. Moreover, we 
demonstrated that RNF125 could attenuate autophagy, oxidative stress, and 
protect epithelial barrier in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, we identified 
HMGB1 as a substrate of RNF125, which interacted with the HMG B-box domain of 
HMGB1 and induced degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system, reducing 
autophagy and oxidative stress. Overall, our findings elucidated that 
hypermethylation of Rnf125 reduced its expression, which promoted 
autophagy-induced oxidative stress in asthma by increasing HMGB1 stability. 
These findings offer a theoretical and experimental basis for the pathogenesis 
of asthma.
