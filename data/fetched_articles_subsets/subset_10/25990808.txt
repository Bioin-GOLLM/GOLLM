BACKGROUND: Virus-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) plays a role in the 
outcome of genital HPV infections. To cast further light on the question why 
most women clear their HPV infection while others develop high-grade cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), we analyzed HPV16 E2-, E6- and E7 -specific CMI 
in women who developed CIN during a 10-year follow-up of the Finnish Family HPV 
cohort.
METHODS: Overlapping 30-35 mer peptides covering the entire HPV16 E2-, E6- and 
E7 protein sequences were used for defining the lymphocyte proliferation 
capacity, cytokine production (IL-2, IL-5, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ and TNF-α) and 
numbers of HPV16 -specific CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells in 10 women who 
developed CIN, and in 22 control women who tested constantly HPV-negative during 
the follow-up. HPV-specific CMI was related to the demographic data including 
sexual behavior, smoking and alcohol consumption.
RESULTS: Women with CIN and their controls had similar T-cell mediated immunity 
against HPV16 E2, E6 and E7 peptide pools. However, nearly fourfold higher 
T-cell reactivity against common antigens was found in the CIN women than in the 
healthy donors (p = 0.001). HPV16 E6 stimulation resulted in higher IL-17A 
secretion in the controls than in the CIN women (p = 0.035). Smoking and use of 
alcohol affected the T-cell response to common antigens but not to HPV peptides 
(p = 0.032 and 0.045, respectively).
CONCLUSION: While both the CIN women and controls exhibited an HPV16-specific 
CMI, IL-17A might be of importance in HPV induced pathology. The 
hyper-responsiveness of the CIN patients to common antigens needs further 
studies. Smoking and alcohol had no effect on HPV-specific CMI.
