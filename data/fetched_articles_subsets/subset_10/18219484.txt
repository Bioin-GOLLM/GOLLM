Molecular imaging aims towards the non-invasive characterization of 
disease-specific molecular alterations in the living organism in vivo. In that, 
molecular imaging opens a new dimension in our understanding of disease 
pathogenesis, as it allows the non-invasive determination of the dynamics of 
changes on the molecular level. IMAGING OF AD CHARACTERISTIC CHANGES BY 
microPET: The imaging technology being employed includes magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and nuclear imaging as well as optical-based imaging technologies. 
These imaging modalities are employed together or alone for disease phenotyping, 
development of imaging-guided therapeutic strategies and in basic and 
translational research. In this study, we review recent investigations employing 
positron emission tomography and MRI for phenotyping mouse models of Alzheimer's 
disease by imaging. We demonstrate that imaging has an important role in the 
characterization of mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases.
