Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that produce a variety of hematopoietic lineage 
cells throughout the life reside in specialized microenvironment called "niche" 
in the bone marrow (BM) where they are tightly regulated. With the recent 
advances in experimental technologies enabling the selective deletion of 
molecules, various types of cells in the BM have been proposed to contribute to 
HSC niche activity. Among these are stromal cells closely associated with the 
vasculature. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in HSC 
niche research, and focus on the studies describing the functional roles of 
perivascular cells for HSC maintenance and mobilization. Not only for 
physiologic state, we also discuss the recent evidences suggesting the 
importance of microenvironment for emergence of malignant hematopoietic 
diseases.
