Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is a B-cell lymphosarcoma caused by the bovine 
leukemia virus (BLV). While most infected cattle show no clinical signs, 
approximately 30% of infected cattle develop persistent lymphocytosis (PL), and 
a small percentage may develop EBL. Currently, there is no method for predicting 
the possibility of EBL onset. In this study, we analyzed the microRNAs (miRNAs) 
encapsulated in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in the blood to explore the 
biomarkers of EBL. To identify candidate biomarkers, blood samples were 
collected from three BLV-uninfected and three EBL cattle. Total RNA was 
extracted from filtered serum and used for microarray analysis. Due to their 
association with cancer in human orthologs, we selected three miRNAs as 
candidate biomarkers, bta-miR-17-5p, bta-miR-24-3p, and bta-miR-210, which were 
more than twice as abundant in EBL cattle than in BLV-uninfected cattle. 
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using serum RNAs from 
six cattle used for the microarray analysis was carried out for the detection of 
the three selected miRNAs. Additionally, bta-miR-92a, whose ortholog has been 
associated with cancer in humans, was also examined by qPCR. bta-miR-17-5p, 
bta-miR-24-3p, and bta-miR-92a, were successfully detected, but bta-miR-210 was 
not. To further evaluate the utility of these three miRNAs as biomarkers, new 
blood samples were collected from 31 BLV-uninfected and 30 EBL cattle. The 
levels of bta-miR-17-5p, bta-miR-24-3p, and bta-miR-92a, were significantly 
higher in EBL cattle than in BLV-uninfected cattle. These results suggest that 
increased levels of bta-miR-17-5p, bta-miR-24-3p, and bta-miR-92a in the blood 
could be used as biomarkers for EBL. This study may contribute to the control of 
BLV infections and develop a prediction method of EBL onset.
