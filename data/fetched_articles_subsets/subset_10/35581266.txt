Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels initiate action potentials. Fast 
inactivation of NaV channels, mediated by an Ile-Phe-Met motif, is crucial for 
preventing hyperexcitability and regulating firing frequency. Here we present 
cryo-electron microscopy structure of NaVEh from the coccolithophore Emiliania 
huxleyi, which reveals an unexpected molecular gating mechanism for NaV channel 
fast inactivation independent of the Ile-Phe-Met motif. An N-terminal helix of 
NaVEh plugs into the open activation gate and blocks it. The binding pose of the 
helix is stabilized by multiple electrostatic interactions. Deletion of the 
helix or mutations blocking the electrostatic interactions completely abolished 
the fast inactivation. These strong interactions enable rapid inactivation, but 
also delay recovery from fast inactivation, which is ~160-fold slower than human 
NaV channels. Together, our results provide mechanistic insights into fast 
inactivation of NaVEh that fundamentally differs from the conventional local 
allosteric inhibition, revealing both surprising structural diversity and 
functional conservation of ion channel inactivation.
