Cordycepin or 3'-deoxyadenosine is an interesting anti-cancer drug candidate 
that is found in abundance in the fungus Cordyceps militaris. It inhibits 
cellular growth of many cancers including lung carcinoma, melanoma, bladder 
cancer, and colon cancer by inducing apoptosis, anti-proliferation, 
anti-metastasis and by arresting the cell cycle. Cordycepin has, however, poor 
stability and low solubility in water, resulting in loss of its bioactivity. 
Liposomes can be used to overcome these obstacles. Our aim is to improve 
cordycepin's anti-colon cancer activity by liposome encapsulation. 
Cordycepin-encapsulated liposomes were designed and fabricated based on a 
combination of theoretical and experimental studies. Molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations and free energy calculations suggest that phosphatidylcholine (PC) 
lipid environment is favorable for cordycepin adsorption. Cordycepin passively 
permeates into PC lipid bilayers without membrane damage and strongly binds to 
the lipids' polar groups by flipping its deoxyribose sugar toward the bilayer 
center. Our fabricated liposomes containing 10 : 1 molar ratio of egg yolk 
PC : cholesterol showed encapsulation efficiency (%EE) of 99% using microfluidic 
hydrodynamic focusing (MHF) methods. In our in vitro study using the HT-29 colon 
cancer cell line, cordycepin was able to inhibit growth by induction of 
apoptosis. Cell viability was significantly decreased below 50% at 125 μg mL-1 
dosage after 48 h treatment with non-encapsulated and encapsulated cordycepin. 
Importantly, encapsulation provided (1) a 2-fold improvement in the inhibition 
of cancer cell growth at 125 μg mL-1 dosage and (2) 4-fold increase in release 
time. These in silico and in vitro studies indicate that cordycepin-encapsulated 
liposomes could be a potent drug candidate for colon cancer therapy.
