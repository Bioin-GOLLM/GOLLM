Nearly all cases of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in South Korea have the 
C2 genotype. Here, we have identified a chronically infected patient who was 
co-infected with HBV of both the A2 and C2 genotypes by screening 135 Korean 
chronically infected patients using direct sequencing protocols targeting the 
1032-bp polymerase reverse transcriptase (RT) region. Further polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)-cloning analysis (22 clones) of the RT showed that this patient 
had genotype C2 (12 clones), genotype A2 (six clones) and A2/C2 inter-genotype 
HBV recombinants (four clones). BootScan analysis showed that three of the four 
recombinants have different types of recombination breakpoints in both the RT 
and overlapping hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) region. Given the 
significance of HBsAg as a diagnostic or vaccination target against HBV 
infection, clinical implications of these identified recombinants should be 
studied in the future. To our knowledge, this is the first report on A2/C2 
inter-genotype HBV recombinants.
