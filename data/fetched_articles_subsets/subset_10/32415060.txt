Striated muscle contraction is regulated by the translocation of 
troponin-tropomyosin strands over the thin filament surface. Relaxation relies 
partly on highly-favorable, conformation-dependent electrostatic contacts 
between actin and tropomyosin, which position tropomyosin such that it impedes 
actomyosin associations. Impaired relaxation and hypercontractile properties are 
hallmarks of various muscle disorders. The α-cardiac actin M305L hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy-causing mutation lies near residues that help confine tropomyosin 
to an inhibitory position along thin filaments. Here, we investigate M305L actin 
in vivo, in vitro, and in silico to resolve emergent pathological properties and 
disease mechanisms. Our data suggest the mutation reduces actin flexibility and 
distorts the actin-tropomyosin electrostatic energy landscape that, in muscle, 
result in aberrant contractile inhibition and excessive force. Thus, actin 
flexibility may be required to establish and maintain interfacial contacts with 
tropomyosin as well as facilitate its movement over distinct actin surface 
features and is, therefore, likely necessary for proper regulation of 
contraction.
