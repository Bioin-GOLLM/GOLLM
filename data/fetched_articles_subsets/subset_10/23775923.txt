Human Ectrodactyly, Ectodermal dysplasia, Clefting (EEC) syndrome is an 
autosomal dominant developmental disorder defined by limb deformities, skin 
defects, and craniofacial clefting. Although associated with heterozygous 
missense mutations in TP63, the genetic basis underlying the variable 
expressivity and incomplete penetrance of EEC is unknown. Here, we show that 
mice heterozygous for an allele encoding the Trp63 p.Arg318His mutation, which 
corresponds to the human TP63 p.Arg279His mutation found in patients with EEC, 
have features of human EEC. Using an allelic series, we discovered that whereas 
clefting and skin defects are caused by loss of Trp63 function, limb anomalies 
are due to gain- and/or dominant-negative effects of Trp63. Furthermore, we 
identify TAp63 as a strong modifier of EEC-associated phenotypes with regard to 
both penetrance and expressivity.
