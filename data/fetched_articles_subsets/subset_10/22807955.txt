Discoidin domain receptor 2, DDR2, is a tyrosine kinase receptor for fibrillar 
collagen that is involved in postnatal development, tissue repair and primary 
and metastatic cancer progression. Recently, mutations in the DDR2 kinase gene 
were identified in squamous cell lung cancer from large-scale Sanger sequencing. 
The present study investigated the DDR2 gene mutations and mRNA expression in 
surgically treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of squamous histology 
cases. The presence or absence of DDR2 mutations at the kinase and discoidin 
domain was analyzed by direct sequencing. In this cohort, DDR2 mutations were 
not observed in the 166 patients with lung cancer, although DDR2 polymorphisms 
were observed (H136H, n=14) at the discoidin domain. mRNA levels of DDR2 in lung 
tumor samples and the adjacent normal lung samples were simultaneously analyzed. 
DDR2 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in tumor samples compared with 
normal lung samples. However, the DDR2 mRNA levels were elevated in the DDR2 
polymorphism cases.
