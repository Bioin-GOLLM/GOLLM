Humans detect skin temperature changes that are perceived as warm or cool. Like 
humans, mice report forepaw skin warming with perceptual thresholds of less than 
1°C and do not confuse warm with cool. We identify two populations of polymodal 
C-fibers that signal warm. Warm excites one population, whereas it suppresses 
the ongoing cool-driven firing of the other. In the absence of the 
thermosensitive TRPM2 or TRPV1 ion channels, warm perception was blunted, but 
not abolished. In addition, trpv1:trpa1:trpm3-/- triple-mutant mice that cannot 
sense noxious heat detected skin warming, albeit with reduced sensitivity. In 
contrast, loss or local pharmacological silencing of the cool-driven TRPM8 
channel abolished the ability to detect warm. Our data are not reconcilable with 
a labeled line model for warm perception, with receptors firing only in response 
to warm stimuli, but instead support a conserved dual sensory model to 
unambiguously detect skin warming in vertebrates.
