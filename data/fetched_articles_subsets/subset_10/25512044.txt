Sub-Saharan Africa is home to millions of HIV-affected children. These children 
are likely to experience multiple developmental delays. In this chapter, I 
present data highlighting compromised neurobehavioral, mental health, and 
scholastic outcomes for children affected by HIV. Furthermore, I discuss 
biomedical factors (e.g., disease severity and nutritional status) that may 
exacerbate the adverse effects of HIV on childhood outcomes. I also present 
evidence on how psychosocial risk factors such as poor maternal mental health, 
orphanhood, and poverty may aggravate the effects of HIV. The concluding section 
of the chapter highlights conceptual and methodological refinements in research 
on the impact of HIV on child development in Sub-Saharan Africa.
