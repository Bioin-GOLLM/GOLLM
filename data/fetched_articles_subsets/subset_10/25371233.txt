BACKGROUND: Rickets can occur due to Vitamin D deficiency or defects in its 
metabolism. Three rare genetic types of rickets with different alterations of 
genes have been reported, including: Vitamin D dependent rickets type 1, Vitamin 
D dependent rickets type 2 or also known as Vitamin D resistant rickets and 25 
hydroxylase deficiency rickets. Vitamin D dependent rickets type 1 is inherited 
in an autosomal recessive pattern, and is caused by mutations in the CYP27B1 
gene encoding the 1Î±-hydroxylase enzyme. We report here a new mutation in 
CYP27B1, which lead to Vitamin D dependent rickets type 1.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a 13-month-old Arabic Saudi girl with Vitamin D 
dependent rickets type 1 presented with multiple fractures and classic features 
of rickets. A whole exome sequencing identified a novel pathogenic missense 
mutation (CYP27B1:Homozygous c.1510C > T(p.Q504X)) which results in a protein 
truncating alteration. Both parents are heterozygous carriers of the mutation. 
Based on data search in Human Gene Mutation Database, 63 CYP27B1 alterations 
were reported: only 28.6% are protein truncating (5 nonsense, 13 frameshift 
insertions/deletions, 0 gross deletions), while 61.9% are non-truncating (38 
missense, 1 small in-frame insertions/deletion), and 9.5% are possible 
protein-truncating (5 splice, 1 regulatory).
CONCLUSION: The deleterious effect of this alteration, which was the only 
mutation detected in the CYP27B1 common gene of Vitamin D dependent rickets type 
1 in the proband, and its autosomal recessive inheritance fashion, both support 
a pathogenic nature of this mutation as the cause of Vitamin D dependent rickets 
type 1.
