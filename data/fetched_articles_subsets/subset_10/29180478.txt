Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal and disseminating 
cancer resistant to therapy, including checkpoint immunotherapies, and early 
tumor resection and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy fails to improve a poor 
prognosis. In a transgenic mouse model of resectable PDAC, we investigated the 
coordinated activation of T and natural killier (NK) cells in addition to 
gemcitabine chemotherapy to prevent tumor recurrence. Only neoadjuvant, but not 
adjuvant treatment with a PD-1 antagonist effectively supported chemotherapy and 
suppressed local tumor recurrence and improved survival involving both NK and T 
cells. Local T-cell activation was confirmed by increased tumor infiltration 
with CD103+CD8+ T cells and neoantigen-specific CD8 T lymphocytes against the 
marker neoepitope LAMA4-G1254V. To achieve effective prevention of distant 
metastases in a complementary approach, we blocked the NK-cell checkpoint CD96, 
an inhibitory NK-cell receptor that binds CD155, which was abundantly expressed 
in primary PDAC and metastases of human patients. In gemcitabine-treated mice, 
neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade followed by adjuvant inhibition of CD96 significantly 
prevented relapse of PDAC, allowing for long-term survival. In summary, our 
results show in an aggressively growing transgenic mouse model of PDAC that the 
coordinated activation of both innate and adaptive immunity can effectively 
reduce the risk of tumor recurrence after surgery, facilitating long-term 
remission of this lethal disease.Significance: Coordinated neoadjuvant and 
adjuvant immunotherapies reduce the risk of disease relapse after resection of 
murine PDAC, suggesting this concept for future clinical trials. Cancer Res;
