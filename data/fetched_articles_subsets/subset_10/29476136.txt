Chordoid glioma is a rare brain tumor thought to arise from specialized glial 
cells of the lamina terminalis along the anterior wall of the third ventricle. 
Despite being histologically low-grade, chordoid gliomas are often associated 
with poor outcome, as their stereotypic location in the third ventricle makes 
resection challenging and efficacious adjuvant therapies have not been 
developed. Here we performed genomic profiling on 13 chordoid gliomas and 
identified a recurrent D463H missense mutation in PRKCA in all tumors, which 
localizes in the kinase domain of the encoded protein kinase C alpha (PKCÎ±). 
Expression of mutant PRKCA in immortalized human astrocytes led to increased 
phospho-ERK and anchorage-independent growth that could be blocked by MEK 
inhibition. These studies define PRKCA as a recurrently mutated oncogene in 
human cancer and identify a potential therapeutic vulnerability in this uncommon 
brain tumor.
