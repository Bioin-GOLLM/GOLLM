UGT1A7 and UGT1A9 are uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms 
involved in the glucuronidation of mycophenolic acid (MPA). The aim of this 
study was to elucidate MPA pharmacokinetics in UGT1A7 and UGT1A9 intronic I399 
genotypes in Japanese adult renal transplant recipients. Eighty recipients were 
given repeated doses of combination immunosuppressive therapy consisting of 
mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus every 12 hours at a designated time (9:00 
am and 9:00 pm). On day 28 after renal transplantation, plasma MPA 
concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. All 
patients had UGT1A9 98TT/-275TT/-2152CC and UGT1A10 177GG/605CC genotypes. The 
UGT1A7*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*3, and *3/*3 genotypes were detected in 35 
(43.8%), five (6.2%), 28 (35.0%), eight (10.0%), and four (5.0%) patients, 
respectively, and the UGT1A9 I399C/C, C/T, and T/T genotypes were detected in 12 
(15.0%), 33 (41.2%), and 35 (43.8%) patients of the 80 Japanese recipients. 
There were no significant differences in MPA pharmacokinetics among UGT1A7 or 
UGT1A9 intronic I399 genotype groups. The mean dose-adjusted area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 12 hours (AUC0-12) of MPA in 
UGT1A7*1/*1, *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*3, and *3/*3 were 95, 98, 99, 88, and 86 
ng.h/mL/mg, respectively (P = 0.9475). The mean dose-adjusted AUC0-12 of MPA in 
UGT1A9 I399C/C, C/T, and T/T were 87, 99, and 95 ng.h/mL/mg, respectively (P = 
0.6937). The dose-adjusted trough levels of MPA in UGT1A9 I399C/C, C/T, and T/T 
were 5.4, 5.5, and 4.7 ng/mL/mg (P = 0.5845). Although UGT1A7*3 and UGT1A9 
I399C/C are known to have low-activity variants when studied in vitro, they do 
not have reduced in vivo MPA glucuronidation activity. UGT1A7 and UGT1A9 I399 
polymorphisms do not contribute to interindividual differences in MPA 
pharmacokinetics.
