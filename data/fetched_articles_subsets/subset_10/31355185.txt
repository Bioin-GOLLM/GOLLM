Guanine-quadruplexes (G4s) are targets for anticancer therapeutics. In this 
context, human telomeric DNA (HT-DNA) that can fold into G4s sequences are of 
particular interest, and their stabilization with small molecules through a 
visualizable process has become a challenge. As a new type of ligand for HT-G4, 
we designed a tetraimidazolium tetraphenylethene (TPE-Im) as a water-soluble 
light-up G4 probe. We study its G4-binding properties with HT-DNA by UV-Visible 
absorption, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies, which provide 
insights into the interactions between TPE-Im and G4-DNA. Remarkably, TPE-Im 
shows a strong fluorescence enhancement and large shifts upon binding to G4, 
which is valuable for detecting G4s. The association constants for the TPE-Im/G4 
complex were evaluated in different solution conditions via isothermal titration 
calorimetry (ITC), and its binding modes were explored by molecular modeling 
showing a groove-binding mechanism. The stabilization of G4 by TPE-Im has been 
assessed by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) melting assays, which 
show a strong stabilization (ΔT 1/2 around +20°C), together with a specificity 
toward G4 with respect to double-stranded DNA.
