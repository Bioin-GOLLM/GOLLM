ImmunoglobulinA (IgA) is the predominant antibody isotype in the gut, where it 
regulates commensal flora and neutralizes toxins and pathogens. The function of 
food-specific IgA in the gut is unknown but is presumed to protect from food 
allergy. Specifically, it has been hypothesized that food-specific IgA binds 
ingested allergens and promotes tolerance by immune exclusion; however, the 
evidence to support this hypothesis is indirect and mixed. Although it is known 
that healthy adults have peanut-specific IgA in the gut, it is unclear whether 
children also have gut peanut-specific IgA. We found in a cohort of 
non-food-allergic infants (n = 112) that there is detectable stool 
peanut-specific IgA that is similar to adult quantities of gut peanut-specific 
IgA. To investigate whether this peanut-specific IgA is associated with peanut 
tolerance, we examined a separate cohort of atopic children (n = 441) and found 
that gut peanut-specific IgA does not predict protection from development of 
future peanut allergy in infants nor does it correlate with concurrent oral 
tolerance of peanut in older children. We observed higher plasma peanut-specific 
IgA in those with peanut allergy. Similarly, egg white-specific IgA was 
detectable in infant stools and did not predict egg tolerance or outgrowth of 
egg allergy. Bead-based epitope assay analysis of gut peanut-specific IgA 
revealed similar epitope specificity between children with peanut allergy and 
those without; however, gut peanut-specific IgA and plasma peanut-specific IgE 
had different epitope specificities. These findings call into question the 
presumed protective role of food-specific IgA in food allergy.
