AIMS: Wild-type gastrointestinal stromal tumours (wtGIST) are frequently caused 
by inherited pathogenic variants, or somatic alterations in the succinate 
dehydrogenase subunit genes (SDHx). Succinate dehydrogenase is a key enzyme in 
the citric acid cycle. SDH deficiency caused by SDHx inactivation leads to an 
accumulation of succinate, which inhibits DNA and histone demethylase enzymes, 
resulting in global hypermethylation. Epigenetic silencing of the DNA repair 
gene MGMT has proven utility as a positive predictor of the therapeutic efficacy 
of the alklyating drug temozolomide (TMZ) in tumours such as glioblastoma 
multiforme. The aim of this study was to examine MGMT promoter methylation 
status in a large cohort of GIST.
METHODS: MGMT methylation analysis was performed on 65 tumour samples including 
47 wtGIST (33 SDH-deficient wtGIST and 11 SDH preserved wtGIST) and 21 tyrosine 
kinase (TK) mutant GIST.
RESULTS: MGMT promoter methylation was detected in 8 cases of SDH-deficient 
(dSDH) GIST but in none of the 14 SDH preserved wild-type GIST or 21 TK mutant 
GIST samples analysed. Mean MGMT methylation was significantly higher (p 0.0449) 
and MGMT expression significantly lower (p<0.0001) in dSDH wtGIST compared with 
TK mutant or SDH preserved GIST. No correlation was identified between SDHx 
subunit gene mutations or SDHC epimutation status and mean MGMT methylation 
levels.
CONCLUSION: MGMT promoter hypermethylation occurs exclusively in a subset of 
dSDH wtGIST. Data from this study support testing of tumour MGMT promoter 
methylation in patients with dSDH wtGIST to identify those patients who may 
benefit from most from TMZ therapy.
