Potent, cell-permeable, and subtype-selective sialyltransferase inhibitors 
represent an attractive family of substances that can potentially be used for 
the clinical treatment of cancer metastasis. These substances operate by 
specifically inhibiting sialyltransferase-mediated hypersialylation of cell 
surface glycoproteins or glycolipids, which then blocks the sialic acid 
recognition pathway and leads to deterioration of cell motility and invasion. A 
vast amount of evidence for the in vitro and in vivo effects of 
sialyltransferase inhibition or knockdown on tumor progression and tumor cell 
metastasis or colonization has been accumulated over the past decades. In this 
regard, this review comprehensively discusses the results of studies that have 
led to the recent discovery and development of sialyltransferase inhibitors, 
their potential biomedical applications in the treatment of cancer metastasis, 
and their current limitations and future opportunities.
