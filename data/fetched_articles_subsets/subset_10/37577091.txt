Benzoxazole is a resourceful and important member of the heteroarenes that 
connects synthetic organic chemistry to medicinal, pharmaceutical, and 
industrial areas. It is a bicyclic planar molecule and is the most favorable 
moiety for researchers because it has been extensively used as a starting 
material for different mechanistic approaches in drug discovery. The motif 
exhibits a high possibility of broad substrate scope and functionalization to 
offer several biological activities like anti-microbial, anti-fungal, 
anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory effects, and so on. There has been 
a large upsurge in the synthesis of benzoxazole via different pathways. The 
present article presents recent advances in synthetic strategies for benzoxazole 
derivatives since 2018. A variety of well-organized synthetic methodologies for 
benzoxazole using 2-aminophenol with aldehydes, ketones, acids, alcohols, 
isothiocyanates, ortho-esters, and alkynones under different reaction conditions 
and catalysts, viz. nanocatalysts, metal catalysts, and ionic liquid catalysts, 
with other miscellaneous techniques has been summarized.
