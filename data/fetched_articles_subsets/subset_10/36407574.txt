BACKGROUND: Nonselective B-blockers (NSBBs) are believed to have pleiotropic 
effects beyond reducing portal pressure. However, studies also report potential 
harm in patients hospitalized with cirrhosis and ascites. We therefore 
investigated whether NSBB use at ATTIRE trial entry (Albumin to prevent 
infection in chronic liver failure, 2016-19) was associated with increased renal 
or cardiovascular dysfunction, compared the incidence of infection and plasma 
markers of systemic inflammation, and examined mortality at 28-days, 3 and 
6-months.
METHODS: In ATTIRE patients grouped by NSBB use at trial entry, we studied 
infection at baseline, hospital acquired infection and organ dysfunction during 
trial treatment period and mortality, with propensity score matching to account 
for differences in disease severity.
FINDINGS: There were no differences in renal or cardiovascular dysfunction 
between patients treated with NSBBs or not, during days 3-15 of hospitalization, 
despite elevated serum creatinine in NSBB patients at hospitalisation. Use of 
NSBBs was associated with a significant reduction in infection at 
hospitalization (p = 0.006), lower white cell counts throughout hospital stay 
(p < 0.001) and reduced plasma procalcitonin (p = 0.009) and interlukin-8 levels 
(p = 0.04) at baseline, but markers of bacterial translocation and systemic 
inflammation were the same in treatment groups. There was no reduction in 
hospital acquired infections in patients taking NSBBs and no beneficial impact 
on mortality at 28-days, 3 and 6-months.
INTERPRETATIONS: Our real-world data from a completed randomised trial show that 
use of NSBBs in decompensated cirrhosis patients is safe during hospitalisation. 
We also show a potential anti-inflammatory role for NSBBs which may be mediated 
by a downregulation of IL-8 induced leucocytosis, that was associated with 
reduced infection at baseline but not a survival benefit.
