The past two decades have witnessed incredible progress toward understanding the 
genetic and cellular mechanisms of organogenesis. Among the organs that have 
provided key insight into how patterning information is integrated to specify 
and build functional body parts is the Drosophila salivary gland, a relatively 
simple epithelial organ specialized for the synthesis and secretion of high 
levels of protein. Here, we discuss what the past couple of decades of research 
have revealed about organ specification, development, specialization, and death, 
and what general principles emerge from these studies.
