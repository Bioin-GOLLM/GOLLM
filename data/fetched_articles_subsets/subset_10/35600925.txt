Heat stress triggers a specific set of proteins in budding yeast to form 
solid-like biomolecular condensates, which are dispersed by molecular 
chaperones. Here, we describe a protocol to study the kinetics of 
chaperone-facilitated condensate dispersal using biochemical reconstitution and 
fluorescence anisotropy. Although the current protocol is tailored to study 
heat-induced condensates of poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1), the protocol can be 
modified to study any protein which shows differential substrate binding 
activity upon condensation. For complete details on the use and execution of 
this protocol, please refer to Yoo et al. (2022).
