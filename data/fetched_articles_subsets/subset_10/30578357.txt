Current regimens for the detection and surveillance of bladder cancer are 
invasive and have suboptimal sensitivity. Here, we present a novel 
high-throughput sequencing (HTS) method for detection of urine tumor DNA (utDNA) 
called utDNA CAPP-Seq (uCAPP-Seq) and apply it to 67 healthy adults and 118 
patients with early-stage bladder cancer who had urine collected either prior to 
treatment or during surveillance. Using this targeted sequencing approach, we 
detected a median of 6 mutations per patient with bladder cancer and observed 
surprisingly frequent mutations of the PLEKHS1 promoter (46%), suggesting these 
mutations represent a useful biomarker for detection of bladder cancer. We 
detected utDNA pretreatment in 93% of cases using a tumor mutation-informed 
approach and in 84% when blinded to tumor mutation status, with 96% to 100% 
specificity. In the surveillance setting, we detected utDNA in 91% of patients 
who ultimately recurred, with utDNA detection preceding clinical progression in 
92% of cases. uCAPP-Seq outperformed a commonly used ancillary test (UroVysion, 
P = 0.02) and cytology and cystoscopy combined (P ≤ 0.006), detecting 100% of 
bladder cancer cases detected by cytology and 82% that cytology missed. Our 
results indicate that uCAPP-Seq is a promising approach for early detection and 
surveillance of bladder cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that utDNA can be 
detected using HTS with high sensitivity and specificity in patients with 
early-stage bladder cancer and during post-treatment surveillance, significantly 
outperforming standard diagnostic modalities and facilitating noninvasive 
detection, genotyping, and monitoring.This article is highlighted in the In This 
Issue feature, p. 453.
