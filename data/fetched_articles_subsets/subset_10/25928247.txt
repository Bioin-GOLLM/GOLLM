BACKGROUND: Legumes have the unique capability to undergo root nodule and 
arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Both types of root endosymbiosis are regulated 
by NSP2, which is a target of microRNA171h (miR171h). Although, recent data 
implies that miR171h specifically restricts arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in 
the root elongation zone of Medicago truncatula roots, there is limited 
knowledge available about the spatio-temporal regulation of miR171h expression 
at different physiological and symbiotic conditions.
RESULTS: We show that miR171h is functionally expressed from an unusual long 
primary transcript, previously predicted to encode two identical miR171h 
strands. Both miR171h and NSP2 transcripts display a complex regulation pattern, 
which involves the symbiotic status and the fertilization regime of the plant. 
Quantitative Real-time PCR revealed that miR171h and NSP2 transcript levels show 
a clear anti-correlation in all tested conditions except in mycorrhizal roots, 
where NSP2 transcript levels were induced despite of an increased miR171h 
expression. This was also supported by a clear correlation of transcript levels 
of NSP2 and MtPt4, a phosphate transporter specifically expressed in a 
functional AM symbiosis. MiR171h is strongly induced in plants growing in 
sufficient phosphate conditions, which we demonstrate to be independent of the 
CRE1 signaling pathway and which is also not required for transcriptional 
induction of NSP2 in mycorrhizal roots. In situ hybridization and promoter 
activity analysis of both genes confirmed the complex regulation involving the 
symbiotic status, P and N nutrition, where both genes show a mainly mutual 
exclusive expression pattern. Overexpression of miR171h in M. truncatula roots 
led to a reduction in mycorrhizal colonization and to a reduced nodulation by 
Sinorhizobium meliloti.
CONCLUSION: The spatio-temporal expression of miR171h and NSP2 is tightly linked 
to the nutritional status of the plant and, together with the results from the 
overexpression analysis, points to an important function of miR171h to integrate 
the nutrient homeostasis in order to safeguard the expression domain of NSP2 
during both, arbuscular mycorrhizal and root nodule symbiosis.
