Dopamine (DA) signaling dysfunction is believed to contribute to multiple 
neuropsychiatric disorders including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD). The rare DA transporter (DAT) coding substitution Ala559Val found in 
subjects with ADHD, bipolar disorder and autism, promotes anomalous DA efflux in 
vitro and, in DAT Val559 mice, leads to increased reactivity to imminent 
handling, waiting impulsivity, and enhanced motivation for reward. Here, we 
report that, in contrast to amphetamine and methylphenidate, which induce 
significant locomotor activation, cocaine administration to these mice elicits 
no locomotor effects, despite retention of conditioned place preference (CPP). 
Additionally, cocaine fails to elevate extracellular DA. Given that amphetamine 
and methylphenidate, unlike cocaine, lack high-affinity interactions with the 
serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT), we hypothesized that the lack of 
cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion in DAT Val559 mice arises from SERT blockade and 
augmented 5-HT signaling relative to cocaine actions on wildtype animals. 
Consistent with this idea, the SERT blocker fluoxetine abolished 
methylphenidate-induced locomotor activity in DAT Val559 mice, mimicking the 
effects seen with cocaine. Additionally, a cocaine analog (RTI-113) with greater 
selectivity for DAT over SERT retains locomotor activation in DAT Val559 mice. 
Furthermore, genetic elimination of high-affinity cocaine interactions at SERT 
in DAT Val559 mice, or specific inhibition of 5-HT2C receptors in these animals, 
restored cocaine-induced locomotion, but did not restore cocaine-induced 
elevations of extracellular DA. Our findings reveal a significant serotonergic 
plasticity arising in the DAT Val559 model that involves enhanced 5-HT2C 
signaling, acting independently of striatal DA release, capable of suppressing 
the activity of cocaine-sensitive motor circuits.
