Bone loss raises great concern in numerous situations, such as ageing and many 
diseases and in both orthopedic and dentistry fields of application, with an 
extensive impact on health care. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the 
mechanisms and the determinants that can regulate osteogenesis and ensure bone 
balance. Autophagy is a well conserved lysosomal degradation pathway, which is 
known to be highly active during differentiation and development. This review 
provides a revision of the literature on all the exogen factors that can 
modulate osteogenesis through autophagy regulation. Metal ion exposition, 
mechanical stimuli, and biological factors, including hormones, nutrients, and 
metabolic conditions, were taken into consideration for their ability to tune 
osteogenic differentiation through autophagy. In addition, an exhaustive 
overview of biomaterials, both for orthopedic and dentistry applications, 
enhancing osteogenesis by modulation of the autophagic process is provided as 
well. Already investigated conditions regulating bone regeneration via autophagy 
need to be better understood for finely tailoring innovative therapeutic 
treatments and designing novel biomaterials.
