As part of an ongoing search for new natural products from medicinal plants to 
treat type 2 diabetes, two new compounds, a megastigmane sesquiterpenoid 
sulfonic acid (1) and a new cyclohexylethanoid derivative (2), and seven related 
known compounds (3-9) were isolated from the leaves of Wedelia chinensis 
(Osbeck.) Merr. The structures of the compounds were conducted via 
interpretation of their spectroscopic data (1D and 2D NMR, IR, and MS), and the 
absolute configurations of compound 1 were determined by the modified Mosher's 
method. The MeOH extract of W. chinensis was found to inhibit α-amylase and 
α-glucosidase inhibitory activities as well as by the compounds isolated from 
this extract. Furthermore, compound 7 showed the strongest effect with IC50 
values of 112.8 ± 15.1 μg/mL (against α-amylase) and 785.9 ± 12.7 μg/mL (against 
α-glucosidase). Compounds 1, 8, and 9 showed moderate α-amylase and 
α-glucosidase inhibitory effects. Other compounds showed weak or did not show 
any effect on both enzymes. The results suggested that the antidiabetic 
properties from the leaves of W. chinensis are not simply a result of each 
isolated compound but are due to other components such as the accessibility of 
polyphenolic groups to α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities.
