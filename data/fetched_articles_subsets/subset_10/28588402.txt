Continuum modelling of granular flow has been plagued with the issue of 
ill-posed dynamic equations for a long time. Equations for incompressible, 
two-dimensional flow based on the Coulomb friction law are ill-posed regardless 
of the deformation, whereas the rate-dependent μ(I)-rheology is ill-posed when 
the non-dimensional inertial number I is too high or too low. Here, 
incorporating ideas from critical-state soil mechanics, we derive conditions for 
well-posedness of partial differential equations that combine compressibility 
with I-dependent rheology. When the I-dependence comes from a specific friction 
coefficient μ(I), our results show that, with compressibility, the equations are 
well-posed for all deformation rates provided that μ(I) satisfies certain 
minimal, physically natural, inequalities.
