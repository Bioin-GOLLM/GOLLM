The integral membrane protein DsbB in Escherichia coli is responsible for 
oxidizing the periplasmic protein DsbA, which forms disulfide bonds in substrate 
proteins. We have developed a high-resolution structural model by combining 
experimental X-ray and solid-state NMR with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. 
We embedded the high-resolution DsbB structure, derived from the joint 
calculation with X-ray reflections and solid-state NMR restraints, into the 
lipid bilayer and performed MD simulations to provide a mechanistic view of DsbB 
function in the membrane. Further, we revealed the membrane topology of DsbB by 
selective proton spin diffusion experiments, which directly probe the 
correlations of DsbB with water and lipid acyl chains. NMR data also support the 
model of a flexible periplasmic loop and an interhelical hydrogen bond between 
Glu26 and Tyr153.
