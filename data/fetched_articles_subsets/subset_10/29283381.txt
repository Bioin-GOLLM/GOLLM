A growing body of studies has documented the pathological influence of impaired 
alternative splicing (AS) events on numerous diseases, including cancer. In 
addition, the generation of alternatively spliced isoforms is frequently noted 
to result in drug resistance in many cancer therapies. To gain comprehensive 
insights into the impacts of AS events on cancer biology and therapeutic 
developments, this paper highlights recent findings regarding the therapeutic 
routes of targeting alternative-spliced isoforms and splicing regulators to 
treatment strategies for distinct cancers.
