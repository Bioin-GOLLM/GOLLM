PURPOSE: Stargardt disease (STGD1), the most common early-onset recessive 
macular degeneration, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the 
ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA4. Although extensive genetic studies have 
identified more than 1000 mutations that cause STGD1 and related 
ABCA4-associated diseases, few studies have investigated the extent to which 
mutations affect the biochemical properties of ABCA4. The purpose of this study 
was to correlate the expression and functional activities of missense mutations 
in ABCA4 identified in a cohort of Canadian patients with their clinical 
phenotype.
METHODS: Eleven patients from British Columbia were diagnosed with STGD1. The 
exons and exon-intron boundaries were sequenced to identify potential pathologic 
mutations in ABCA4. Missense mutations were expressed in HEK293T cells and their 
level of expression, retinoid substrate binding properties, and ATPase 
activities were measured and correlated with the phenotype of the STGD1 
patients.
RESULTS: Of the 11 STGD1 patients analyzed, 7 patients had two mutations in 
ABCA4, 3 patients had one detected mutation, and 1 patient had no mutations in 
the exons and flanking regions. Included in this cohort of patients was a 
severely affected 11-year-old child who was homozygous for the novel 
p.Ala1794Pro mutation. Expression and functional analysis of this variant and 
other disease-associated variants compared favorably with the phenotypes of this 
cohort of STGD1 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Although many factors contribute to the phenotype of STGD1 
patients, the expression and residual activity of ABCA4 mutants play a major 
role in determining the disease severity of STGD1 patients.
