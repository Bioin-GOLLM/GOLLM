The potential of fluoride (F) as a neurotoxicant in humans is still 
controversial in the literature. However, recent studies have raised the debate 
by showing different mechanism of F-induced neurotoxicity, as oxidative stress, 
energy metabolism and inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). In the 
present study, we investigated the mechanistic action of two F concentration 
(0.095 and 0.22 μg/ml) on gene and protein profile network using a human glial 
cell in vitro model over 10 days of exposure. A total of 823 genes and 2,084 
genes were modulated after exposure to 0.095 and 0.22 μg/ml F, respectively. 
Among them, 168 were found to be modulated by both concentrations. The number of 
changes in protein expression induced by F were 20 and 10, respectively. Gene 
ontology annotations showed that the main terms were related to cellular 
metabolism, protein modification and cell death regulation pathways, such as the 
MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade, in a concentration independent manner. Proteomics 
confirmed the changes in energy metabolism and also provided evidence of 
F-induced changes in cytoskeleton components of glial cells. Our results not 
only reveal that F has the potential to modulate gene and protein profiles in 
human U87 glial-like cells overexposed to F, but also identify a possible role 
of this ion in cytoskeleton disorganization.
