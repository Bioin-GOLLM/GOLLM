β-cell autoantibodies against insulin (IAA), GAD65 (GADA) and IA-2 (IA-2A) 
precede onset of childhood type 1 diabetes (T1D). Incidence of the first 
appearing β-cell autoantibodies peaks at a young age and is patterned by 
T1D-associated genes, suggesting an early environmental influence. Here, we 
tested if gestational infections and interactions with child's human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes affected the appearance of the first β-cell 
autoantibody. Singletons of mothers without diabetes (n = 7472) with 
T1D-associated HLA-DR-DQ genotypes were prospectively followed quarterly through 
the first 4 years of life, then semiannually until age 6 years, using 
standardized autoantibody analyses. Maternal infections during pregnancy were 
assessed via questionnaire 3-4.5 months post-delivery. Polymorphisms in twelve 
non-HLA genes associated with the first appearing β-cell autoantibodies were 
included in a Cox regression analysis. IAA predominated as the first appearing 
β-cell autoantibody in younger children (n = 226, median age at seroconversion 
1.8 years) and GADA (n = 212; 3.2 years) in children aged ≥2 years. Gestational 
infections were not associated with the first appearing β-cell autoantibodies 
overall. However, gestational respiratory infections (G-RI) showed a consistent 
protective influence on IAA (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.91) among CTLA4-(AG, GG) 
children (G-RI*CTLA4 interaction, p = 0.002). The predominant associations of 
HLA-DR-DQ 4-8/8-4 with IAA and HLA-DR-DQ 3-2/3-2 with GADA were not observed if 
a G-RI was reported (G-RI*HLA-DR-DQ interaction, p = 0.03). The role of G-RI may 
depend on offspring HLA and CTLA-4 alleles and supports a bidirectional trigger 
for IAA or GADA as a first appearing β-cell autoantibody in early life.
