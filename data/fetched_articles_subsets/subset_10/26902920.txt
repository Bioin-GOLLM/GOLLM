Hypotrichosis is an abnormal condition characterized by decreased hair density 
and various defects in hair structure and growth patterns. In particular, in 
woolly hair, hypotrichosis is characterized by a tightly curled structure and 
abnormal growth. In this study, we present a detailed comparative examination of 
individuals affected by autosomal-recessive hypotrichosis (ARH), which 
distinguishes two types of ARH. Earlier, we demonstrated that exon 4 deletion in 
the lipase H gene caused an ARH (hypotrichosis 7; MIM: 604379) in populations of 
the Volga-Ural region of Russia. Screening for this mutation in all affected 
individuals revealed its presence only in the group with the hypotrichosis 7 
phenotype. Other patients formed a separate group of woolly hair-associated ARH, 
with a homozygous missense mutation c.712G>T (p.Val238Leu) in a highly conserved 
position of type I keratin KRT25 (K25). Haplotype analysis indicated a founder 
effect. An expression study in the HaCaT cell line demonstrated a deleterious 
effect of the p.Val238Leu mutation on the formation of keratin intermediate 
filaments. Hence, we have identified a previously unreported missense mutation 
in the KRT25 gene causing ARH with woolly hair.
