Resonance Raman spectroscopy is employed to characterize heme site structural 
changes arising from conformational heterogeneity in deoxyMb and ligated 
derivatives, i.e., the ferrous CO (MbCO) and ferric cyanide (MbCN) complexes. 
The spectra for the reversed forms of these derivatives have been extracted from 
the spectra of reconstituted samples. Dramatic changes in the low-frequency 
spectra are observed, where newly observed RR modes of the reversed forms are 
assigned using protohemes that are selectively deuterated at the four methyl 
groups or at the four methine carbons. Interestingly, while substantial changes 
in the disposition of the peripheral vinyl and propionate groups can be inferred 
from the dramatic spectral shifts, the bonds to the internal histidyl imidazole 
ligand and those of the Fe-CO and Fe-CN fragments are not significantly affected 
by the heme rotation, as judged by lack of significant shifts in the 
nu(Fe-N(His)), nu(Fe-C), and nu(C-O) modes. In fact, the apparent lack of an 
effect on these key vibrational parameters of the Fe-N(His), Fe-CO, and Fe-CN 
fragments is entirely consistent with previously reported equilibrium and 
kinetic studies that document virtually identical functional properties for the 
native and reversed forms.
