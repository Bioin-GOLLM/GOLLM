Mitophagy affects the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). 
Mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ) is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant 
that reduces the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
However, its relationship with mitophagy remains unclear. This study evaluated 
mitophagy during HSC activation and the effects of MitoQ on mitophagy in cell 
culture and in an animal model of the activation of HSCs. We found that MitoQ 
reduced the activation of HSCs and alleviated hepatic fibrosis. PINK1 
(PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) is a putative serine/threonine kinase located 
in the mitochondria's outer membrane. While the activation of primary HSCs or 
LX-2 cells was associated with reduced PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy, MitoQ 
reduced intracellular ROS levels, enhanced PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy, and 
inhibited the activation of HSCs. After knocking down the key mitophagy-related 
protein, PINK1, in LX-2 cells to block mitophagy, MitoQ intervention failed to 
inhibit HSC activation. Our results showed that MitoQ inhibited the activation 
of HSCs and alleviated hepatic fibrosis by enhancing PINK1/parkin-mediated 
mitophagy.
