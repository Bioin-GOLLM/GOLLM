Cell adhesion molecule CD2 and its ligand CD58 provide good examples of 
protein-protein interactions in cells that participate in the immune response. 
To modulate the cell adhesion interaction, peptides were designed from the 
discontinuous epitopes of the β-strand region of CD2 protein. The two strands 
were linked by a peptide bond. β-Strands in the peptides were nucleated by 
inserting a β-sheet-inducing (D)-Pro-Pro sequence or a dibenzofuran (DBF) turn 
mimetic with key amino acid sequences from CD2 protein that binds to CD58. The 
solution structures of the peptides (5-10) were studied by NMR and molecular 
dynamics simulations. The ability of these peptides to inhibit cell adhesion 
interaction was studied by E-rosetting and lymphocyte epithelial assays. 
Peptides 6 and 7 inhibit the cell adhesion activity with an IC(50) of 7 and 11 
nM, respectively, in lymphocyte epithelial adhesion assay. NMR and molecular 
modeling results indicated that peptides 6 and 7 exhibited β-hairpin structure 
in solution.
