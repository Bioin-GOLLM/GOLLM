Peptides provide an attractive modality for targeting challenging drug targets 
such as intracellular protein-protein interactions. Unfortunately, peptides are 
generally impermeable to the cell membrane and inherently susceptible to 
proteolytic degradation in vivo. Macrocyclization of peptides greatly increases 
their proteolytic stability and in some cases the cell-penetrating activity. 
Conjugation of peptidyl cargoes to cyclic cell-penetrating peptides has resulted 
in potent, cell-permeable, and metabolically stable macrocyclic peptides against 
intracellular protein targets. Proper conjugation/integration of a peptidyl 
cargo with a cyclic cell-penetrating peptide is critical to retain the activity 
of each component and generate a biologically active macrocyclic peptide. This 
chapter describes the different conjugation strategies that have been developed 
(including endocyclic, bicyclic, and reversible cyclization methods) and the 
detailed protocols for their preparation.
