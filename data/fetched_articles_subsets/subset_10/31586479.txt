Dissociation of a protein from DNA is often assumed to be described by an off 
rate that is independent of other molecules in solution. Recent experiments and 
computational analyses have challenged this view by showing that unbinding rates 
(residence times) of DNA-bound proteins can depend on concentrations of nearby 
molecules that are competing for binding. This 'facilitated dissociation' (FD) 
process can occur at the single-binding site level via formation of a ternary 
complex, and can dominate over 'spontaneous dissociation' at low (submicromolar) 
concentrations. In the crowded intracellular environment FD introduces new 
regulatory possibilities at the level of individual biomolecule interactions.
