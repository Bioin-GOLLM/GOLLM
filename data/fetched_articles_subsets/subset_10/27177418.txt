The sense of smell enables animals to react to long-distance cues according to 
learned and innate valences. Here, we have mapped with electron microscopy the 
complete wiring diagram of the Drosophila larval antennal lobe, an olfactory 
neuropil similar to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We found a canonical circuit 
with uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) relaying gain-controlled ORN 
activity to the mushroom body and the lateral horn. A second, parallel circuit 
with multiglomerular projection neurons (mPNs) and hierarchically connected 
local neurons (LNs) selectively integrates multiple ORN signals already at the 
first synapse. LN-LN synaptic connections putatively implement a bistable gain 
control mechanism that either computes odor saliency through panglomerular 
inhibition, or allows some glomeruli to respond to faint aversive odors in the 
presence of strong appetitive odors. This complete wiring diagram will support 
experimental and theoretical studies towards bridging the gap between circuits 
and behavior.
