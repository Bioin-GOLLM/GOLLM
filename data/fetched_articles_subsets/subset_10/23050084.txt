Intracerebral injection of brain extracts containing amyloid or tau aggregates 
in transgenic animals can induce cerebral amyloidosis and tau pathology. We 
extracted pure populations of tau oligomers directly from the cerebral cortex of 
Alzheimer disease (AD) brain. These oligomers are potent inhibitors of long term 
potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal brain slices and disrupt memory in wild type 
mice. We observed for the first time that these authentic brain-derived tau 
oligomers propagate abnormal tau conformation of endogenous murine tau after 
prolonged incubation. The conformation and hydrophobicity of tau oligomers play 
a critical role in the initiation and spread of tau pathology in the na√Øve host 
in a manner reminiscent of sporadic AD.
