BACKGROUND: Few studies have reported the adherence to and efficacy of 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for improving diabetes management in 
insulin-treated older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: Prospective observational cohort study using FreeStyle Libre Flash CGM 
in insulin-treated adults > 65 years with T2DM and HbA1c between 7% and 9%. The 
participants wore the CGM during the 6-weeks study period. The primary outcome 
was time in range (TIR) between 70 and 180 mg/dL. Secondary outcomes included 
time below range (TBR), glycemic variability (GV), adherence, and use of glucose 
data for self-insulin adjustment. Linear regressions with random effects 
verified the changes in TBR, TIR, time above range (TAR), GV, and GMI across the 
three visits using CGM (baseline, 4 weeks and 6 weeks), controlled for sex, age, 
educational level, and health system (private or public).
RESULTS: A total of 66 participants completed the six weeks of CGM (age 
72·8 ± 5·3 years; BMI 27·8 ± 3·6 kg/m2), HbA1c: 8·0 ± 0·6%, with an overall 
sensor utilization of 93·1 ± 6·0%. We observed a stability in TIR (baseline: 
63.5 ± 18.9% vs. endpoint: 65.5 ± 18.8%; β = 1,0, p = 0.190). Despite the low 
TBR at the baseline, we observed statistically significant reduction over the 
study period (baseline: 5.8 ± 7.0% vs. endpoint: 3.8 ± 4.7%; (β=-1.00, 
p = 0.008). Glucose variability also reduced from the baseline (34.9 ± 7.2%) to 
the endpoint (33.0 ± 6.8%) (β=-0.99, p = < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: FreeStyle Libre Flash CGM is well accepted by older adults with T2DM 
and allows participants to make therapeutic decisions to reduce TBR and glycemic 
variability.
