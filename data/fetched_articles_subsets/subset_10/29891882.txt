A rare syndrome was first described in 1997 in a 17-year-old male patient 
presenting with Retinitis pigmentosa, HYpopituitarism, Nephronophthisis and 
Skeletal dysplasia (RHYNS). In the single reported familial case, two brothers 
were affected, arguing for X-linked or recessive mode of inheritance. Up to now, 
the underlying genetic basis of RHYNS syndrome remains unknown. Here we applied 
whole-exome sequencing in the originally described family with RHYNS to identify 
compound heterozygous variants in the ciliary gene TMEM67. Sanger sequencing 
confirmed a paternally inherited nonsense c.622A > T, p.(Arg208*) and a 
maternally inherited missense variant c.1289A > G, p.(Asp430Gly), which perturbs 
the correct splicing of exon 13. Overall, TMEM67 showed one of the widest 
clinical continuum observed in ciliopathies ranging from early lethality to 
adults with liver fibrosis. Our findings extend the spectrum of 
phenotypes/syndromes resulting from biallelic TMEM67 variants to now eight 
distinguishable clinical conditions including RHYNS syndrome.
