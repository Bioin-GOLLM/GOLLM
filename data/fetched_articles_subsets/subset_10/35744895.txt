Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) are metabolic enzymes commonly mutated in human 
cancers (glioma, acute myeloid leukaemia, chondrosarcoma, and intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma). These mutated variants of IDH (mIDH) acquire a neomorphic 
activity, namely, conversion of α-ketoglutarate to the oncometabolite 
D-2-hydroxyglutarate involved in tumourigenesis. Thus, mIDHs have emerged as 
highly promising therapeutic targets, and several mIDH specific inhibitors have 
been developed. However, the evaluation of mIDH status, currently performed by 
biopsy, is essential for patient stratification and thus treatment and 
follow-up. We report herein the development of new radioiodinated and 
radiofluorinated analogues of olutasidenib (FT-2102) as tools for noninvasive 
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission 
tomography (PET) imaging of mIDH1 up- and dysregulation in tumours. 
Nonradiolabelled derivatives 2 and 3 halogenated at position 6 of the 
quinolinone scaffold were synthesised and tested in vitro for their inhibitory 
potencies and selectivities in comparison with the lead compound FT-2102. Using 
a common organotin precursor, (S)-[125I]2 and (S)-[18F]3 were efficiently 
synthesised by radio-iododemetallation and copper-mediated radiofluorination, 
respectively. Both radiotracers were stable at room temperature in saline or 
DPBS solution and at 37 °C in mouse serum, allowing future planning of their in 
vitro and in vivo evaluations in glioma and chondrosarcoma models.
