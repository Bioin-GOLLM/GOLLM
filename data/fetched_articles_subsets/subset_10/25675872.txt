BACKGROUND: This study was performed to investigate the correlation of 
erythropoietin gene polymorphisms with diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a Chinese 
cohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
DESIGN: Case-control study held in Qilu hospital of Shandong University, China.
PARTICIPANTS: 792 T2DM individuals were involved, classified as groups DR 
(n = 448) and non-DR (NDR; n = 344). The DR group was subdivided into groups 
proliferative DR (PDR; n = 220) and non-PDR (NPDR; n = 228).
METHODS: Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs1617640, rs507392 and 
rs551238, in the erythropoietin gene were genotyped
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios (ORs) for the effects of erythropoietin gene 
polymorphisms on DR risk.
RESULTS: The genotype CC frequency in rs507392 was significantly lower in DR 
group (additive: OR, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.89; P = 0.027; 
recessive: OR, 0.44; 95%CI, 0.23-0.86; P = 0.012) or PDR group (additive OR, 
0.18; 95%CI, 0.05-0.63; P = 0.002; recessive OR, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.06-0.66; 
P = 0.003) than in NDR group. The genotype CC frequency in rs551238 was 
significantly lower in DR group (additive OR, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.21-0.38; P = 0.016; 
recessive OR, 0.40; 95%CI, 0.20-0.79; P = 0.010) or PDR group (additive OR, 
0.18; 95%CI, 0.05-0.62; P = 0.002; recessive OR, 0.18; 95%CI, 0.05-0.61; 
P = 0.002). No significant differences were detected in the distributions of 
rs1617640 genotype or all polymorphisms' alleles between groups NDR and DR, PDR 
or NPDR. Haplotype analyses did not provide any evidence for the correlation 
between the three polymorphisms and DR.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that rs507392 and rs551238 in the erythropoietin 
gene probably act to lessen the risk for DR and PDR in the Chinese T2DM cohort.
