OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the -174 G/C promoter polymorphism 
of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene with endometriosis in South Indian women.
METHODS: The genotype frequencies of the common IL-6 -174 G/C polymorphism were 
compared in infertility patients with (n = 232) and without (n = 210) 
endometriosis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis.
RESULTS: The genotype frequencies among the cases and controls were G/G 62.9% 
and 71.9%, G/C 34.1% and 25.2%, and C/C 3.0% and 2.9%. The G and C allele 
frequencies were 80% and 84.6%, and 20% and 15.4%, respectively. There were no 
statistically significant differences in the genotype distributions or allele 
frequencies between the cases and controls (P = .12).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates no significant association between 
the IL-6 -174 G/C promoter polymorphism and endometriosis in South Indian women.
