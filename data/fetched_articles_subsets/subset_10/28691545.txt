OBJECTIVE: Several polymorphisms have been reported in the 5-HTTLPR of the 
serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). Family-based evidences for the association 
of 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms with OCD were previously reported but results were 
controversial. The present study investigated the possible correlation of SLC6A4 
polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR, rs25532, rs25531) in Iranian OCD patients considering 
gender, age of onset, family history of psychiatric disorders, obsessive and 
compulsive subtypes and severities.
METHODS: The included OCD patients fulfilled the criteria for DSM-IV-TR whom 
Y-BOCS score was more than 9. Blood samples (184 cases and 192 controls) were 
genotyped by means of PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: Mean of Y-BOCS scores of included patients was 20.1 ± 0.69. Rs25532 CC 
genotype showed significant association with OCD in men and were detected more 
in the patients reported positive family history of psychiatric disorders but 
the other single loci (5-HTTLPR and rs25531) did not associate with OCD. 
Haplotype analysis showed significant association of 14-A variant with OCD and 
revealed the association of 14-A/14-A genotype with familial form of OCD.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study showed the association of SLC6A4 
variants with familial form of OCD and proposed stratified analyses in the 
genetic studies facilitate identification of genetic risk factors for this 
heterogeneous disorder.
