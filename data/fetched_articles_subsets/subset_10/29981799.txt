The structural flexibility and small size of aptamers enable precise recognition 
of cellular elements for imaging and therapeutic applications. The process by 
which aptamers are taken into cells depends on their targets but is typically 
clathrin-mediated endocytosis or macropinocytosis. After internalization, most 
aptamers are transported to endosomes, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi 
apparatus, and occasionally mitochondria and autophagosomes. Intracellular 
aptamers, or "intramers," have versatile functions ranging from intracellular 
RNA imaging, gene regulation, and therapeutics to allosteric modulation, which 
we discuss in this review. Immune responses to therapeutic aptamers and the 
effects of G-quadruplex structure on aptamer function are also discussed.
