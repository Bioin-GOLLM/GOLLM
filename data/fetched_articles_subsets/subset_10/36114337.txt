Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway (KP) is implicated in many human 
diseases and disorders, from immunological, metabolic, neurodegenerative, and 
neuropsychiatric conditions to cancer, and represents an appealing target for 
new therapeutic approaches. In this intricate scenario, invertebrates, like 
Lymnaea stagnalis (LS), provide a flexible tool to unravel the complexity of the 
KP. Starting from the available LS genome and transcriptome, we identified 
putative transcripts of all KP enzymes containing an ORF; each predicted protein 
possessed a high degree of sequence conservation to known orthologues of other 
invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms. Sequences were confirmed by 
qualitative PCR and sequencing. At the same time, the qRT-PCR analysis revealed 
that Lym IDO-like, Lym TDO-like, Lym AFMID-like, Lym KMO-like, Lym AADAT-like, 
Lym KYAT I/III-like, Lym KYNU-like, Lym HAAO-like, and Lym ACMSD-like showed 
widespread tissue expression. Then, tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 
anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxy-kynurenine, xanthurenic acid, picolinic acid, and 
quinolinic acid were identified in the hemolymph of LS by UHPLC-Q exactive mass 
spectrometer. Our study provides the most thorough characterization to date of 
the KP in an invertebrate model, supporting the value of LS for future 
functional studies of this pathway at the cellular, synaptic, and behavioral 
levels.
