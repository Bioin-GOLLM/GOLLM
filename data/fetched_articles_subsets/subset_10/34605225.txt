BACKGROUND: Although mounting evidence indicates that insulin resistance (IR) 
co-occurs with mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle, there is no clear 
causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and IR pathogenesis. In this 
study, the exact role of mitochondria in IR development was determined.
METHODS: Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet for 2 weeks to 
induce acute IR or for 24 weeks to induce chronic IR (n = 8 per group). To 
characterize mitochondrial function, we measured citrate synthase activity, ATP 
content, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and oxygen consumption rate in 
gastrocnemius and liver tissues. We intraperitoneally administered mitochondrial 
division inhibitor 1 (mdivi-1) to mice with acute IR and measured mitochondrial 
adaptive responses such as mitophagy, mitochondrial unfolded protein response 
(UPRmt), and oxidative stress (n = 6 per group).
RESULTS: Acute IR occurred coincidently with impaired mitochondrial function, 
including reduced citrate synthase activity (-37.8%, P < 0.01), ATP production 
(-88.0%, P < 0.01), mtDNA (-53.1%, P < 0.01), and mitochondrial respiration 
(-52.2% for maximal respiration, P < 0.05) in skeletal muscle but not in liver. 
Administration of mdivi-1 attenuated IR development by increasing mitochondrial 
function (+58.5% for mtDNA content, P < 0.01; 4.06 ± 0.69 to 
5.84 ± 0.95 pmol/min/mg for citrate synthase activity, P < 0.05; 13.06 ± 0.70 to 
34.87 ± 0.70 pmol/min/g for maximal respiration, P < 0.001). Western blot 
analysis showed acute IR resulted in increased autophagy (mitophagy) and UPRmt 
induction in muscle tissue. This adaptive response was inhibited by mdivi-1, 
which reduced the mitochondrial oxidative stress of skeletal muscle during acute 
IR.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute IR induced mitochondrial oxidative stress that impaired 
mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Improving mitochondrial function has 
important potential for treating acute IR.
