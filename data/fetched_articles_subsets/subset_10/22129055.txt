Mutations in genes encoding the calcium-release activated calcium (CRAC) channel 
abolish calcium influx in cells of the immune system and cause severe congenital 
immunodeficiency. Patients with autosomal recessive mutations in the CRAC 
channel gene ORAI1, its activator stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), and 
mice with targeted deletion of Orai1, Stim1, and Stim2 genes reveal important 
roles for CRAC channels in adaptive and innate immune responses to infection and 
in autoimmunity. Because CRAC channels have important functions outside the 
immune system, deficiency of either ORAI1 or STIM1 is associated with a unique 
clinical phenotype. This review will give an overview of CRAC channel function 
in the immune system, examine the consequences of CRAC channel deficiency for 
immunity in human patients and mice, and discuss genetic defects in 
immunoreceptor-associated signaling molecules that compromise calcium influx and 
cause immunodeficiency.
