INTRODUCTION: Despite half a century of research on vitamin D (Vit. D), its link 
to substance abuse and dependence has only been discussed in recent decades. 
Evidence also shows the involvement of Vit. D in the evolution of dopaminergic 
neurons in the nucleus accumbens, an increase in the expression of tyrosine 
hydroxylase, and the regulation of dopaminergic processes. The novel idea for 
this work is taken from a hypothesis given about the effectiveness of Vit. D on 
dopamine signaling pathway. It is therefore presumed that Vit. D can be 
considered an effective therapeutic approach for narcotic addiction and 
substance abuse.
METHODS: The animals were assigned into six groups (control, vehicle, Morphine 
[Mor.], and Vit. D [250, 500, and 1000 IU/kg, i.p.]). Following each 
conditioning session in a conditioned place preference (CPP) model, the animals 
received Vit. D. Afterward, the locomotor activity of the animals was assessed 
using open-field apparatus. Malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), catalase 
(CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), thiol, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) 
were measured in the brain. The relative DRD2 and GDNF expressions (%) were also 
measured in the hippocampus.
RESULTS: Vit. D administration after Mor. caused a significant increase in the 
place preference index in the acquisition phase (p < .05). Vit. D altered the 
oxidation/antioxidation profiles (CAT, SOD, MDA, NO, TAC, and Thiol). Vit. D was 
more effective than Mor. in the expression of GDNF (p < .0001); however, in the 
expression of DRD2, this was only the case for 1000 IU Vit. D (p < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the increased place preference index induced by Mor., 
it can be concluded that Vit. D interacts via the oxidative pathway and 
DRD2-GDNF signaling to potentiate the Mor. effect.
