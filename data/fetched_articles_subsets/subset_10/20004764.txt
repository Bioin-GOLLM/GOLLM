Autosomal-recessive inheritance accounts for nearly 25% of nonsyndromic mental 
retardation (MR), but the extreme heterogeneity of such conditions markedly 
hampers gene identification. Combining autozygosity mapping and RNA expression 
profiling in a consanguineous Tunisian family of three MR children with mild 
microcephaly and white-matter abnormalities identified the TRAPPC9 gene, which 
encodes a NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IkappaB kinase complex beta 
(IKK-beta) binding protein, as a likely candidate. Sequencing analysis revealed 
a nonsense variant (c.1708C>T [p.R570X]) within exon 9 of this gene that is 
responsible for an undetectable level of TRAPPC9 protein in patient skin 
fibroblasts. Moreover, TNF-alpha stimulation assays showed a defect in IkBalpha 
degradation, suggesting impaired NF-kappaB signaling in patient cells. This 
study provides evidence of an NF-kappaB signaling defect in isolated MR.
