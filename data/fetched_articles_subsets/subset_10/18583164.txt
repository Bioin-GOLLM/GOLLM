Three thrombophilic polymorphisms, FV G1691A, FII G20210A and MTHFR C677T were 
investigated in Israeli populations by FRET, (fluorescence resonance energy 
transfer) real-time PCR. We observe extensive variability in the frequencies of 
each of the polymorphisms, as has been observed in the study of other 
polymorphisms in these populations. Very high allele frequencies for FV G1691A 
(the highest 0.087 in Turkish and Greek Jews) and FII G20210A (the highest 0.061 
in Georgian Jews) in some of the Israeli populations justify a clinical 
investigation to assess their risk for venous thrombosis. Principal Coordinates 
Analysis demonstrates that the Jewish populations are interspersed among the 
non-Jewish populations. The resemblance of some Jewish populations to certain 
non-Jewish populations coincides with findings based on classical markers.
