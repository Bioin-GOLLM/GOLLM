We have amplified the cDNA for the transacylase (E2) subunit of the 
branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKAD) complex from a 
thiamine-responsive MSUD cell line (WG-34) by the polymerase chain reaction. 
Sequencing of the amplified WG-34 cDNA showed a 17-bp insertion 
(AAATACCTTGTTACCAG) apparently resulting from an aberrant splicing of the E2 
gene, and a missense (T----G) mutation that changes Phe215 to Cys in the E2 
subunit. The existence of these two mutations was confirmed by probing the 
amplified E2 cDNA or genomic DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotides. The 
above results support the thesis that the thiamine-responsive MSUD patient 
(WG-34) is a compound heterozygote at the E2 locus. The implication of the E2 
mutations for the thiamine-responsiveness observed in this patient is discussed.
