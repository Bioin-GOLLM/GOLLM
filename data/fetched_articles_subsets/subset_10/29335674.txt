The aim of this review is to cover advances in noble metal nanoparticle 
(MNP)-based biosensors and to outline the principles and main functions of MNPs 
in different classes of biosensors according to the transduction methods 
employed. The important biorecognition elements are enzymes, antibodies, 
aptamers, DNA sequences, and whole cells. The main readouts are electrochemical 
(amperometric and voltametric), optical (surface plasmon resonance, 
colorimetric, chemiluminescence, photoelectrochemical, etc.) and piezoelectric. 
MNPs have received attention for applications in biosensing due to their 
fascinating properties. These properties include a large surface area that 
enhances biorecognizers and receptor immobilization, good ability for reaction 
catalysis and electron transfer, and good biocompatibility. MNPs can be used 
alone and in combination with other classes of nanostructures. MNP-based sensors 
can lead to significant signal amplification, higher sensitivity, and great 
improvements in the detection and quantification of biomolecules and different 
ions. Some recent examples of biomolecular sensors using MNPs are given, and the 
effects of structure, shape, and other physical properties of noble MNPs and 
nanohybrids in biosensor performance are discussed.
