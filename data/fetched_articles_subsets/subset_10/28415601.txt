GATA3 polymorphisms were reported to be significantly associated with 
susceptibility of pediatric B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), by 
impacting on GATA3 expression. We noticed that ALL-related GATA3 polymorphism 
located around in the tissue-specific enhancer, and significantly associated 
with GATA3 expression. Although the regulatory network of GATA3 has been well 
reported in T cells, the functional status of GATA3 is poorly understood in 
B-ALL. We thus conducted genome-wide gene expression association analyses to 
reveal expression associated genes and pathways in nine independent B-ALL 
patient cohorts. In B-ALL patients, 173 candidates were identified to be 
significantly associated with GATA3 expression, including some reported 
GATA3-related genes (e.g., ITM2A) and well-known tumor-related genes (e.g., 
STAT4). Some of the candidates exhibit tissue-specific and subtype-specific 
association with GATA3. Through overexpression and down-regulation of GATA3 in 
leukemia cell lines, several reported and novel GATA3 regulated genes were 
validated. Moreover, association of GATA3 expression and its targets can be 
impacted by SNPs (e.g., rs4894953), which locate in the potential GATA3 binding 
motif. Our findings suggest that GATA3 may be involved in multiple tumor-related 
pathways (e.g., STAT/JAK pathway) in B-ALL to impact leukemogenesis through 
epigenetic regulation.
