BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been implemented in clinical 
oncology to analyze multiple genes and to guide targeted therapy; however, 
little is known about the performance of the Oncomine Dx Target Test compared 
with conventional single gene tests for detecting EGFR mutations. The objective 
of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Oncomine Dx Target Test 
compared with a PNA-LNA PCR clamp test to detect EGFR mutations.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) from whom FFPE samples were simultaneously submitted for the 
Oncomine Dx Target Test, and a PNA-LNA PCR clamp test using the same specimen. 
We subsequently compared the analysis success rates and detection rates between 
the two tests.
RESULTS: A total of 116 samples were identified. The success rates and detection 
rates of EGFR mutations in the total number of samples were 90% and 28%, 
respectively for the Oncomine Dx Target Test, and 100% and 35% for the PNA-LNA 
PCR clamp test. The Oncomine Dx Target Test was unable to analyze three samples 
(2%) due to the samples not passing the nucleic acid concentration threshold, 
and nine (8%) samples had invalid results. The exon 19 deletion was not detected 
by the Oncomine Dx Target Test in four cases (4%).
CONCLUSIONS: The analytical performance of the Oncomine Dx Target Test analysis 
for EGFR mutations may not be comparable with conventional single gene tests due 
to both invalid and false-negative results.
KEY POINTS: Significant findings of the study The success rate of the Oncomine 
Dx Target Test was significantly lower than the PNA-LNA PCR clamp test. Among 
the samples successfully analyzed, four exon 19 deletions were not detected by 
the Oncomine Dx Target Test. What this study adds The analytical performance of 
the Oncomine Dx Target Test may not be comparable with conventional single gene 
tests. We should revise the sampling procedures, and review the sample quality 
assessment methods, to improve the analytical performance.
