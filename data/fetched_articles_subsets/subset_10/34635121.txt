Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a stromal cell population with 
cell-of-origin, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity, are the most essential 
components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Through multiple pathways, 
activated CAFs can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, 
along with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and even chemoresistance. 
Numerous previous studies have confirmed the critical role of the interaction 
between CAFs and tumor cells in tumorigenesis and development. However, 
recently, the mutual effects of CAFs and the tumor immune microenvironment 
(TIME) have been identified as another key factor in promoting tumor 
progression. The TIME mainly consists of distinct immune cell populations in 
tumor islets and is highly associated with the antitumor immunological state in 
the TME. CAFs interact with tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as other 
immune components within the TIME via the secretion of various cytokines, growth 
factors, chemokines, exosomes and other effector molecules, consequently shaping 
an immunosuppressive TME that enables cancer cells to evade surveillance of the 
immune system. In-depth studies of CAFs and immune microenvironment 
interactions, particularly the complicated mechanisms connecting CAFs with 
immune cells, might provide novel strategies for subsequent targeted 
immunotherapies. Herein, we shed light on recent advances regarding the direct 
and indirect crosstalk between CAFs and infiltrating immune cells and further 
summarize the possible immunoinhibitory mechanisms induced by CAFs in the TME. 
In addition, we present current related CAF-targeting immunotherapies and 
briefly describe some future perspectives on CAF research in the end.
