BACKGROUND: The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene encodes the 
catalytic subunit of telomerase, which mediates pleiotropic effects, including 
the regulation of senescence and proliferation and plays an important role in 
carcinogenesis. This study attempts to clarify the genetic predisposition to 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focusing on the hTERT gene rs2736098 
polymorphism.
METHOD: Four hundred patients with HCC and 400 non-cancer controls were 
genotyped to elucidate the potential association between hTERT rs2736098 
polymorphism and HCC risks.
RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the patients with HCC had a lower frequency 
of G/G genotype (33.3% vs 44.3%, P=0.001) and a higher frequency of G/A (51.5% 
vs 39.5%, P=0.001). Allele genotypic frequencies in the patients differed from 
those of the controls (P=0.040). The data of this study rs2736098[A] allele 
contributed significantly to HCC risk in female patients (OR=1.78, 95% CI, 
1.17-2.72, P=0.007), patients with HCV infection (OR=2.89, 95% CI, 1.08-7.70, 
P=0.031), non-drinker patients (OR=1.32, 95% CI, 1.06-1.65, P=0.015), and 
patients not affected by HBV (OR=1.77, 95% CI, 1.30-2.40, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: rs2736098[A] may be an independent hereditary parameter in HCC, but 
some risk factors would cover up the association by more powerful 
hepatocarcinogenesis. These results are important guidance for further studies 
in detecting HCC-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms.
