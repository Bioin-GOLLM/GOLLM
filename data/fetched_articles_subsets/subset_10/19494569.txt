Gene therapy for the inner ear: challenges and promises.

Ryan AF, Dazert S.

Since the recognition of genes as the discrete units of heritability, and of DNA 
as their molecular substrate, the utilization of genes for therapeutic purposes 
has been recognized as a potential means of correcting genetic disorders. The 
tools of molecular biology, which allow the manipulation of DNA sequence, 
provided the means to put this concept into practice. However, progress in the 
implementation of these ideas has been slow. Here we review the history of the 
idea of gene therapy and the complexity of genetic disorders. We also discuss 
the requirements for sequence-based therapy to be accomplished for different 
types of inherited diseases, as well as the methods available for gene 
manipulation. The challenges that have limited the applications of gene therapy 
are reviewed, as are ethical concerns. Finally, we discuss the promise of gene 
therapy to address inherited and acquired disorders of the inner ear.
