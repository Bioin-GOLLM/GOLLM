Haemorrhagic smolt syndrome (HSS) is a disorder of unknown aetiology causing 
losses in the fresh water phase of Atlantic salmon farming. Normally, the 
mortality is limited and symptoms disappear upon seawater exposure. In this case 
study, classical HSS pathology with internal organ haemorrhages and 
nephrocalcinosis was diagnosed, and the losses were substantial. Microarray 
analyses of head kidney revealed association between HSS and enhanced expression 
of stress genes and proteins reducing bioavailability of iron, heme, and 
retinol. In parallel, suppression of multiple metabolic pathways was observed. 
Up-regulation of genes encoding acute phase proteins, complement, and lectins 
indicated mild inflammation but without characteristic features of viral or 
bacterial infections. Microarray analyses highlighted several members of tumor 
necrosis factor receptor superfamily that may control development of B-cell 
immunity. Examination of IgM at the mRNA and protein levels showed the impact of 
HSS on vaccine responses. In fish without HSS symptoms (non-HSS), titres of 
vaccine specific antibodies to A-layer of Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. 
salmonicida and Moritella viscosa and antibodies binding to DNP-keyhole limpet 
hemocyanin (DNP-KLH), which are presumably polyreactive, were respectively four- 
and 14-fold higher than in HSS-diseased fish. Parallel sequencing of variable 
regions of immunoglobulin Mrevealed a larger size of most abundant clonotypes 
shared by multiple individuals in the non-HSS group. The results of the current 
case study indicated that, in addition to direct damage, HSS suppresses humoral 
immune responses including the production of specific and polyreactive 
antibodies.
