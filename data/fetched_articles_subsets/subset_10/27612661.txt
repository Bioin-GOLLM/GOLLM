BACKGROUND: Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are a family of detoxification 
enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to electrophilic 
compounds.
METHODS: A library of alpha class GSTs was constructed by DNA shuffling using 
the DNA encoding the human glutathione transferase A1-1 (hGSTA1-1) and the rat 
glutathione transferase A1-1 (rGSTA1-1).
RESULTS: Activity screening of the library allowed the selection of a chimeric 
enzyme variant (GSTD4) that displayed high affinity towards GSH and 
GSH-Sepharose affinity adsorbent, higher kcat/Km and improved thermal stability, 
compared to the parent enzymes. The crystal structures of the GSTD4 enzyme in 
free form and in complex with GSH were determined to 1.6Å and 2.3Å resolution, 
respectively. Analysis of the GSTD4 structure showed subtle conformational 
changes in the GSH-binding site and in electron-sharing network that may 
contribute to the increased GSH affinity. The shuffled variant GSTD4 was further 
optimized for improved oxidative stability employing site-saturation 
mutagenesis. The Cys112Ser mutation confers optimal oxidative stability and 
kinetic properties in the GSTD4 enzyme.
CONCLUSIONS: DNA shuffling allowed the creation of a chimeric enzyme variant 
with improved properties, compared to the parent enzymes. X-ray crystallography 
shed light on how recombination of a specific segment from homologous GSTA1-1 
together with point mutations gives rise to a new functionally competent enzyme 
with improved binding, catalytic properties and stability.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Such an engineered GST would be useful in biotechnology as 
affinity tool in affinity chromatography as well as a biocatalytic matrix for 
the construction of biochips or enzyme biosensors.
