BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Two recent genome-wide association studies have 
identified a shared susceptibility variation PLCE1 rs2274223 for esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas (GCA). 
Subsequent case-control studies have reported this association in other 
populations. However, the findings were controversial and the effect remains 
undetermined. Our aim is to provide a precise quantification of the association 
between PLCE1 rs2274223 variation and the risk of ESCC and GCA.
METHODS: Studies were identified by a literature search in MEDLINE and EMBASE 
databases. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
used to assess the association in allele, dominant, recessive, homozygous, and 
heterozygous models.
RESULTS: Ten articles were identified, including 22156 ESCC cases and 28803 
controls, 5197 GCA cases and 17613 controls. Overall, PLCE1 rs2274223 G allele 
(G vs. A: OR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.15-1.39 for ESCC; OR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.35-1.69 for 
GCA) and its carrier (GG +AG vs. AA: OR = 1.23; 95% CI =1.02-1.49 for ESCC; OR 
=1.62; 95% CI =1.15-2.29 for GCA) were significantly associated with the risk of 
ESCC and GCA. In stratified analysis by ethnicity, significant association of 
PLCE1 rs2274223 G allele and the risk of ESCC (OR=1.33, 95% CI 1.21-1.45) and 
GCA (OR =1.56, 95% CI: 1.47-1.64) was observed in Chinese population.
CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis results indicated that PLCE1 rs2274223 G allele 
significantly contributed to the risk of ESCC and GCA, especially in Chinese 
population.
