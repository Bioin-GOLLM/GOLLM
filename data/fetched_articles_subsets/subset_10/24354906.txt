OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between angiotensin converting enzyme 
(ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and diabetic essential 
hypertension in elderly population.
METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used in 260 elderly 
normal control patients, 205 elderly hypertensive patients and 138 elderly 
diabetic hypertensive patients to detect the I/D polymorphism in ACE gene.
RESULTS: DD genotype frequency (0.352) and D allele frequency (0.543) in elderly 
hypertensive patients were higher than those in the normal control patients. DD 
genotype (0.421) and D allele frequency (0.579) in elderly diabetic hypertensive 
patients were significantly higher than those in the control patients (0.133 and 
0.250). The differences of DD genotype and D allele frequency between the 
elderly hypertensive patients and the elderly diabetic hypertensive patients 
were not significant (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: ACE gene deletion is a risk factor for hypertension but is not a 
risk factor for diabetes in elderly population.
