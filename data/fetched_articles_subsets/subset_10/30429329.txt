RNA polymerase is the only known protein partner of the transcriptional 
regulator DksA. Herein, we demonstrate that the chaperone DnaJ establishes 
direct, redox-based interactions with oxidized DksA. Cysteine residues in the 
zinc finger of DksA become oxidized in Salmonella exposed to low concentrations 
of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The resulting disulfide bonds unfold the globular 
domain of DksA, signaling high-affinity interaction of the C-terminal α-helix to 
DnaJ. Oxidoreductase and chaperone activities of DnaJ reduce the disulfide bonds 
of its client and promote productive interactions between DksA and RNA 
polymerase. Simultaneously, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which is 
synthesized by RelA in response to low concentrations of H2O2, binds at site 2 
formed at the interface of DksA and RNA polymerase and synergizes with the 
DksA/DnaJ redox couple, thus activating the transcription of genes involved in 
amino acid biosynthesis and transport. However, the high concentrations of ppGpp 
produced by Salmonella experiencing oxidative stress oppose DksA/DnaJ-dependent 
transcription. Cumulatively, the interplay of DksA, DnaJ, and ppGpp on RNA 
polymerase protects Salmonella from the antimicrobial activity of the NADPH 
phagocyte oxidase. Our research has identified redox-based signaling that 
activates the transcriptional activity of the RNA polymerase regulator DksA.
