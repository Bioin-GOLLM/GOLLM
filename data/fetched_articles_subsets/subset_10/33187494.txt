BACKGROUND: Germinomas (IG) account for up to 50% of all intracranial germ cell 
tumours. These tumours are reputed to be more prevalent in Oriental populations 
in comparison to Western cohorts. Biological characteristics of IG in other 
ethnic groups are unknown. Singapore is a multi-ethnic country with diverse 
cultures. Owing to inter-racial heterogeneity, the authors hypothesize there are 
molecular differences between paediatric IG patients in our local population. 
The aims of this study are exploratory: firstly, to identify molecular 
characteristics in this tumour type and circulating CSF unique to different 
racial cohorts; and next, to corroborate our findings with published literature.
METHODS: This is a single-institution, retrospective study of prospectively 
collected data. Inclusion criteria encompass all paediatric patients with 
histologically confirmed IG. Excess CSF and brain tumour tissues are collected 
for molecular analysis. Tumour tissues are subjected to a next generation 
sequencing (NGS) targeted panel for KIT and PDGRA. All CSF samples are profiled 
via a high-throughput miRNA multiplexed workflow. Results are then corroborated 
with existing literature and public databases.
RESULTS: In our cohort of 14 patients, there are KIT exon variants in the tumour 
tissues and CSF miRNAs corroborative with published studies. Separately, there 
are also KIT exon variants and miRNAs not previously highlighted in IG. A 
subgroup analysis demonstrates differential CSF miRNAs between Chinese and Malay 
IG patients.
CONCLUSION: This is the first in-depth molecular study of a mixed ethnic 
population of paediatric IGs from a Southeast Asian cohort. Validation studies 
are required to assess the relevance of novel findings in our study.
