The role of genetic abnormality of δ-sarcoglycan (δ-SG) gene in dilated (DCM) 
and hypertrophied (HCM) cardiomyopathy patients is still unfolding. In this 
study we first defined the promoter region and then searched for 
polymorphisms/mutations among the promoter, 5'-untranslated region, and the 
encoding exons in δ-SG gene in 104 Chinese patients with DCM, 145 with HCM, and 
790 normal controls. Two novel polymorphisms were found, an 11 base-pair (bp) 
deletion (c.-100~-110; -) in the promoter region and a missense polymorphism of 
A848G resulting in p.Q283R in the highly conserved C-terminus. The prevalence of 
homozygous genotype -/- of c.-100~-110 was slightly higher in DCM (14.42%) and 
HCM patients (14.48%), as compared with normal controls (11.01%). The prevalence 
of genotype of 848A/G was significantly higher in DCM (6.73%; OR = 9.43; p = 
0.0002), but not in HCM patients (1.38%; OR = 1.37; p = 0.62), as compared with 
controls (0.76%). Haplotype -_G consisting c.-100~-110 and A848G was associated 
with increased risk of DCM (OR = 17.27; 95%CI = 3.19-93.56; p = 0.001) but not 
associated with HCM (OR = 1.90; 95%CI = 0.38-9.55; p = 0.44). Co-occurrence of 
the genotypes -/- of c.-100~-110 and 848A/G was found in 5 patients with DCM 
(4.81%; OR = 39.85; p = 0.0001), none of HCM patients, and only 1 of the 
controls (0.13%). Both polymorphisms were also found in the Japanese population, 
but not in the Africans and Caucasians. C.-100~-110 resulted in a decrease of 
δ-SG promoter activity to 64±3% of the control level (p<0.01). Both 
co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro protein pull-down assays demonstrated that 
δ-SG-283R interacts normally to β- and γ-SG, but significantly decreased 
localization of β/δ/γ-SG on the plasma membrane. In conclusion, haplotype -_G 
composed of c.-100~-110 and A848G confers higher susceptibility to DCM in the 
Mongoloid population.
