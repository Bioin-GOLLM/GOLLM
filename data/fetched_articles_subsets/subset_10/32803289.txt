PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of diltiazem on tacrolimus sparing in pediatric 
primary nephrotic syndrome (PNS) and its relation to CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, and 
SLCO1B3 polymorphisms.
METHODS: The PNS children treated with tacrolimus and with steady-state trough 
concentration (C0) were retrospectively collected. The impacts of diltiazem on 
tacrolimus dose-adjusted C0 (C0/D), target concentration achievement, and 
required dose were evaluated. Meanwhile, the relationship between the 
polymorphisms (including CYP3A4*1G, CYP3A5*3, ABCB1-C3435T, and SCLO1B3) and 
dose-sparing effect were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 71 children with 535 concentrations, including 16 children 
with concomitant diltiazem, were involved. Significantly increased C0/D (94.0 vs 
83.8 ng/mL per mg/kg, p = 0.038) and lower required daily dose of tacrolimus 
(0.056 vs 0.064 mg/kg, p = 0.003) were observed in patients co-administered with 
diltiazem. Subpopulation carrying CYP3A4*1G, CYP3A5*1, ABCB1-3435TT, or 
SLCO1B3-699AA was presented with enhanced increment in tacrolimus C0/D by 
38.8-102.9%.
CONCLUSION: Moderate effect of diltiazem on tacrolimus sparing, which might 
relate to the polymorphisms of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, ABCB1, and SLCO1B3, was 
documented.
