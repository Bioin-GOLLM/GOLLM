Aspergillus fumigatus is a human fungal pathogen that can cause devastating 
pulmonary infections, termed "aspergilloses," in individuals suffering immune 
imbalances or underlying lung conditions. As rapid adaptation to stress is 
crucial for the outcome of the host-pathogen interplay, here we investigated the 
role of the versatile posttranslational modification (PTM) persulfidation for 
both fungal virulence and antifungal host defense. We show that an A. fumigatus 
mutant with low persulfidation levels is more susceptible to host-mediated 
killing and displays reduced virulence in murine models of infection. 
Additionally, we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human 
gene encoding cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH) causes a reduction in cellular 
persulfidation and correlates with a predisposition of hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant recipients to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), as correct 
levels of persulfidation are required for optimal antifungal activity of 
recipients' lung resident host cells. Importantly, the levels of host 
persulfidation determine the levels of fungal persulfidation, ultimately 
reflecting a host-pathogen functional correlation and highlighting a potential 
new therapeutic target for the treatment of aspergillosis.
