Aberrant gene expression underlies many human diseases. RNA polymerase II (Pol 
II) pausing is a key regulatory step in transcription. Here, we mapped the 
locations of RNA Pol II in normal human cells and found that RNA Pol II pauses 
in a consistent manner across individuals and cell types. At more than 1,000 
genes including MYO1E and SESN2, RNA Pol II pauses at precise nucleotide 
locations. Characterization of these sites shows that RNA Pol II pauses at 
GC-rich regions that are marked by a sequence motif. Sixty-five percent of the 
pause sites are cytosines. By differential allelic gene expression analysis, we 
showed in our samples and a population dataset from the Genotype-Tissue 
Expression (GTEx) consortium that genes with more paused polymerase have lower 
expression levels. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the pause sites led to a 
significant increase in promoter activities. Thus, our data uncover that RNA Pol 
II pauses precisely at sites with distinct sequence features that in turn 
regulate gene expression.
