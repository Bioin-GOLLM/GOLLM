Rumex L., a genus in Polygonaceae family with about 200 species, is growing 
widely around the world. Some Rumex species, called "sorrel" or "dock", have 
been used as food application and treatment of skin diseases and hemostasis 
after trauma by the local people of its growing areas for centuries. To date, 29 
Rumex species have been studied to contain about 268 substances, including 
anthraquinones, flavonoids, naphthalenes, stilbenes, diterpene alkaloids, 
terpenes, lignans, and tannins. Crude extract of Rumex spp. and the pure 
isolates displayed various bioactivities, such as antibacterial, 
anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, cardiovascular protection and 
antiaging activities. Rumex species have important potential to become a 
clinical medicinal source in future. This review covers research articles from 
1900 to 2022, fetched from SciFinder, Web of Science, ResearchGate, CNKI and 
Google Scholar, using "Rumex" as a search term ("all fields") with no specific 
time frame set for the search. Thirty-five Rumex species were selected and 
summarized on their geographical distribution, edible parts, traditional uses, 
chemical research and pharmacological properties.
