BACKGROUND: Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disease 
resulting from deficient alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) activity. Renal 
failure is a major debilitating complication in classically affected males. To 
determine if this disorder is underdiagnosed in patients with end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD), the frequency of unrecognized males with Fabry disease on 
chronic hemodialysis was determined.
METHODS: Plasma alpha-Gal A activity was measured in 514 consecutive males with 
ESRD on hemodialysis. Patients with low alpha-Gal A activity were evaluated 
clinically and their alpha-Gal A mutations were determined.
RESULTS: Six (1.2%) of 514 hemodialysis patients had low plasma alpha-Gal A 
activities and a previously identified (E66Q, A97V, M296I) or novel (G373D) 
missense mutation. At ages 30 to 68 years, five patients lacked the classic 
manifestations of angiokeratoma, acroparesthesias, hypohidrosis, and ocular 
opacities, while the sixth lacked angiokeratoma and ocular changes. Five had 
left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
CONCLUSION: The clinical spectrum of Fabry disease includes a "renal variant" 
phenotype in patients without classic symptoms who develop ESRD. Affected males 
undergoing hemodialysis or renal transplantation can be readily diagnosed by 
plasma alpha-Gal A assays. These patients and their family members may benefit 
from enzyme replacement therapy for the later, life-threatening cardiovascular 
and cerebrovascular complications of Fabry disease.
