BACKGROUND: The IL-33/ST2 immune axis plays crucial roles in infection and 
immunity. A dysregulated IL-33/ST2 axis can induce autoimmune reaction and 
inflammatory responses. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute peripheral 
neuropathy, mostly caused by post-infection autoimmunity. The role of IL-33/ST2 
axis is not known in GBS. This study aimed to explore the role of IL-33/ST2 axis 
in GBS.
METHODS: Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Il33 gene (rs16924159, 
rs7044343, rs1342336) and three SNPs of Il1rl1 gene (rs10192157, rs1041973, 
rs10206753) coding for suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) were genotyped in 
179 GBS patients and 186 healthy controls by TaqMan Allelic Discrimination 
Assay. Plasma levels of IL-33 and sST2 were measured in a subset of GBS patients 
(n = 80) and healthy controls (n = 80) by ELISA.
RESULTS: The frequencies of CC genotype of rs10192157 (p = 0.043) and TT 
genotype of rs10206753 (p = 0.036) SNPs of Il1rl1 gene differed significantly 
between GBS patients and healthy controls. Gene-gene interaction between Il33 
and Il1rl1 genes also conferred significant risk for GBS. In addition, the 
plasma sST2 levels were significantly elevated in GBS patients compared to 
healthy subjects (24,934.31 ± 1.81 pg/ml vs. 12,518.97 ± 1.51 pg/ml, p < 0.001). 
Plasma sST2 levels showed a significant correlation with the disability scores 
at the peak of neurological deficit in GBS patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The IL-33/ST2 axis is suggested to influence the immunopathogenesis 
of GBS. Genetic variants of Il1rl1 gene might serve as a risk determinant of GBS 
and plasma sST2 levels might emerge as a biomarker of severity of GBS, if 
replicated further by other studies.
