(1) Background: Resistance mechanisms represent a barrier to anti-cancer 
therapies. Liquid biopsies would allow obtaining additional information in order 
to develop targeted therapies to thwart the resistance phenomena but also to 
follow in time real response to treatment and be able to adapt it the most 
quickly possible way in case of resistance. (2) Methods: herein we summarize the 
different liquid biopsies which are currently under research; we then review the 
literature and focalize on one of their potential roles: the theranostic one and 
especially in the cases of colorectal cancers. (3) Results: few studies 
targeting liquid biopsy as a potential tool to adapt cancer treatments are 
present in the literature and encompass few patients. (4) Conclusions: further 
research is needed to prove the efficiency of LB. Indeed, it seems a promising 
tool to guide treatment by targeting actionable mutations with detection of 
resistant mutations.
