Currently marketed influenza vaccines only confer protection against matching 
influenza virus strains. The influenza A composition of these vaccines needs to 
be annually updated. Vaccines that target conserved epitopes of influenza 
viruses would in principle offer broad cross-protection against influenza A 
viruses. In our study, we investigated the specific immune responses and 
protective efficacy of protein nanoparticles based on fusion proteins of 
flagellin carrier linked to conserved influenza epitopes. We designed fusion 
proteins by replacing the hyperimmunogenic region of flagellin (FliC) with four 
tandem copies of the ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (f4M2e), H1 HA2 domain 
(fHApr8) or H3 HA2 domain (fHAaichi). Protein nanoparticles fabricated from 
these fusion proteins by using DTSSP crosslinking retained Toll-like receptor 5 
agonist activity of FliC. Intranasal immunization with f4M2e, f4M2e/fHApr8 or 
f4M2e/fHAaichi nanoparticles induced vaccine antigen-specific humoral immune 
responses. It was also found that the incorporation of the H1 HA2 domain into 
f4M2e/fHApr8 nanoparticles boosted M2e specific antibody responses. Immunized 
mice were fully protected against lethal doses of virus challenge.
