BACKGROUND: Choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) is a rare, malignant tumor occurring 
more commonly in children than adults. This case report describes the clinical 
course of a 3-year-old boy with a rare case of metastatic CPC with a novel TP53 
mutation.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 3-year-old boy presented with postconcussive symptoms after 
a fall. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed lesions in 
the suprasellar cistern, left lateral ventricle, and cauda equina. The tumor was 
diagnosed as choroid plexus carcinoma with a novel TP53 V216M somatic mutation. 
The patient underwent resection of the left lateral ventricle lesion.
CONCLUSION: We describe a case of CPC with highly metastatic characteristics and 
a novel TP53 mutation. Our report implicates TP53 in the pathogenesis of 
pediatric CPC, and we emphasize that CPC in children should prompt careful 
consideration of TP53 status to inform prognosis and clinical treatment.
