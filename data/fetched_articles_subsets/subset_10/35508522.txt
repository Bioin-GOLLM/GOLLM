The pandemic burden caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus constitutes a global 
public health emergency. Increasing understanding about predisposing factors to 
infection and severity is now a priority. Genetic, metabolic, and environmental 
factors can play a crucial role in the course and clinical outcome of COVID-19. 
We aimed to investigate the putative relationship between genetic factors 
associated to obesity, metabolism and lifestyle, and the presence and severity 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 249 volunteers (178 women and 71 men, with 
mean and ± SD age of 49 ± 11 years) characterized for dietary, lifestyle habits 
and anthropometry, were studied for presence and severity of COVID-19 infection, 
and genotyped for 26 genetic variants related to obesity, lipid profile, 
inflammation, and biorhythm patterns. A statistically significant association 
was found concerning a protective effect of APOE rs7412 against SARS-CoV-2 
infection (p = 0.039; OR 0.216; CI 0.084, 0.557) after correction for multiple 
comparisons. This protective effect was also ascribed to the APOɛ2 allele 
(p = 0.001; OR 0.207; CI 0.0796, 0.538). The genetic variant rs7412 resulting in 
ApoE2, genetic determinant of lipid and lipoprotein levels, could play a 
significant role protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
