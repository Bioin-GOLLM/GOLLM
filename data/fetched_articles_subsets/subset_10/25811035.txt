Recent studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms near the interleukin-28B 
(IL-28B) gene could predict the response to Peg-IFN-a/RBV combination therapy in 
HCV-infected patients. The aim of the study was to correlate the serum level of 
IL28B in HCV-infected patients with virus genotype/subgenotype and disease 
progression. IL28B serum level was detected and variations at five single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL28B gene region were genotyped and 
analyzed. The variation of IL28B genetic polymorphisms was found to be strongly 
associated with HCV infection when healthy control group was compared to 
HCV-infected patients with all P values <0.0001. Functional analysis revealed 
that subjects carrying rs8099917-GG genotype had higher serum level of IL28B 
than those with GT or TT genotypes (P = 0.04). Also, patients who were presented 
with cirrhosis (Cirr) only or with cirrhosis plus hepatocellular carcinoma 
(Cirr+HCC) had higher levels of serum IL28B when compared to chronic 
HCV-infected patients (P = 0.005 and 0.003, resp.). No significant association 
was found when serum levels of IL28B were compared to virus 
genotypes/subgenotypes. This study indicates that variation at SNP rs8099917 
could predict the serum levels of IL28B in HCV-infected patients. Furthermore, 
IL28B serum level may serve as a useful marker for the development of 
HCV-associated sequelae.
