Aims. To compare methylation profiles, protein expression, and microsatellite 
instability (MSI) of sporadic, HNPCC, and familial hyperplastic polyps (HPs). 
Methods. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and pyrosequencing assessed p16, MGMT, 
hMLH-1, MINT 1, and MINT 31 methylation. IHC (Immunohistochemistry) assessed 
Ki67, CK20, hMLH-1, hMSH-2, and hMSH-6 protein expression. MSI analysis was 
performed on those polyps with adequate DNA remaining. Results. 124 HPs were 
identified 78 sporadic, 21 HNPCC, 25 familial, and the HNPCC group demonstrated 
no significant differences in overall methylation (P = .186 Chi(2)). The 
familial group demonstrated significantly less over all methylation levels (P = 
.004 Chi(2)). Conclusions. HPs that occur in HNPCC have no more worrying 
features at a molecular level than those patients with HPs in a sporadic 
setting.
