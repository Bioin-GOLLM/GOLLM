BACKGORUND: Environmental stresses including abiotic stresses and biotic 
stresses limit yield of plants. Stress-tolerant breeding is an efficient way to 
improve plant yield under stress conditions. Genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 can 
be used in molecular breeding to improve agronomic traits in crops, but in most 
cases, with fitness costs. The plant hormone ABA regulates plant responses to 
abiotic stresses via signaling transduction. We previously identified AITRs as a 
family of novel transcription factors that play a role in regulating plant 
responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. We found that abiotic stress tolerance 
was increased in the single, double and triple aitr mutants. However, it is 
unclear if the increased abiotic stress tolerance in the mutants may have 
fitness costs.
RESULTS: We report here the characterization of AITRs as suitable candidate 
genes for CRISPR/Cas9 editing to improve plant stress tolerance. By using 
CRISPR/Cas9 to target AITR3 and AITR4 simultaneously in the aitr256 triple and 
aitr1256 quadruple mutants respectively, we generated Cas9-free aitr23456 
quintuple and aitr123456 sextuple mutants. We found that reduced sensitivities 
to ABA and enhanced tolerance to drought and salt were observed in these 
mutants. Most importantly, plant growth and development was not affected even in 
the aitr123456 sextuple mutants, in whom the entire AITR family genes have been 
knocked out, and the aitr123456 sextuple mutants alsoÂ showed a wild type 
response to the pathogen infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that knockout of the AITR family genes in 
Arabidopsis enhanced abiotic stress tolerance without fitness costs. Considering 
that knock-out a few AITRs will lead to enhanced abiotic stress tolerance, that 
AITRs are widely distributed in angiosperms with multiple encoding genes, AITRs 
may be targeted for molecular breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerance in 
plants including crops.
