Site-directed mutagenesis of the lamB gene was used to introduce individual 
cysteine substitutions at 20 sites in two regions (surface loops L7 and L8) of 
LamB protein significant in antibody recognition. Characterisation of cysteine 
mutants involved immunoblotting with three surface-specific monoclonal 
antibodies (mAb72, mAb302, mAb347) before and after incubation with 
thiol-specific reagents. In contrast to an earlier study that showed no amino 
acid changes affecting recognition by all three antibodies, changes at six amino 
acids were found to influence a common core epitope. These core sites included 
one residue (T336) in the predicted loop L7 containing amino acids 329-342 and 
four (Y379, N387, N389, K392, F398) in the large surface loop involving residues 
370-412. Individual antibodies made additional but distinct contacts within the 
two studied regions, with mAb347 binding the most different and affected by 
seven substitutions in the 328-338 regions. The lamB mutants were also tested 
for phage lambda receptor activity and starch binding before and after thiol 
modification and were useful in extending previous maps of these ligand binding 
sites.
