Targeted therapy with combined dabrafenib and trametinib has been proven to 
provide clinical benefits in patients with NSCLC with a BRAF V600E mutation. 
Nevertheless, the treatment strategy for patients with NSCLC with BRAF non-V600E 
mutations remains limited. Here, we present a patient with NSCLC with a BRAF 
K601E mutation, a class II BRAF mutation, who had a durable response to targeted 
therapy with combined dabrafenib and trametinib.
