OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate factors affecting the operating 
time for complete cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy in paediatric 
cases of congenital choledochal malformation (CCM).
DESIGN: A 3-year retrospective study was undertaken between January 2013 and 
December 2015 in four centres in China.
SETTING: This involved a retrospective chart review of paediatric patients with 
CCM in four large hospitals in Southeast China.
PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-five paediatric patients with CCM were included in this 
study. We derived all available information on patient demographics, clinical 
characteristics, preoperative complications and surgical methods from the charts 
of all these patients.
INTERVENTIONS: Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were 
used to evaluate factors significantly affecting the operating time for complete 
cyst excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy in paediatric cases of CCM.
RESULTS: Twenty-three of the 65 case surgeries were performed using laparoscopic 
technique, and 42 surgeries were performed by conventional open surgery. The 
median operating time was 215 min (range 120-430 min). The morphological subtype 
of CCM and the presence of cholecystitis or cholangitis were the only factors 
found to affect the operating time (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis 
confirmed cholangitis as an independent risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: The morphological subtype of CMM and the presence of cholecystitis 
or cholangitis are factors affecting the operating time for complete cyst 
excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy in paediatric cases of CCM, whereas 
cholangitis is an independent risk factor.
