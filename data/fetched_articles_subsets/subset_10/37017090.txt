BACKGROUND: A large proportion of genetic risk remains unexplained for 
structural heart disease involving the interventricular septum (IVS) including 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ventricular septal defects. This study sought to 
develop a reproducible proxy of IVS structure from standard medical imaging, 
discover novel genetic determinants of IVS structure, and relate these loci to 
diseases of the IVS, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and ventricular septal defect.
METHODS: We estimated the cross-sectional area of the IVS from the 4-chamber 
view of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in 32 219 individuals from the UK 
Biobank which was used as the basis of genome wide association studies and 
Mendelian randomization.
RESULTS: Measures of IVS cross-sectional area at diastole were a strong proxy 
for the 3-dimensional volume of the IVS (Pearson r=0.814, P=0.004), and 
correlated with anthropometric measures, blood pressure, and diagnostic codes 
related to cardiovascular physiology. Seven loci with clear genomic consequence 
and relevance to cardiovascular biology were uncovered by genome wide 
association studies, most notably a single nucleotide polymorphism in an intron 
of CDKN1A (rs2376620; β, 7.7 mm2 [95% CI, 5.8-11.0]; P=6.0×10-10), and a common 
inversion incorporating KANSL1 predicted to disrupt local chromatin structure 
(β, 8.4 mm2 [95% CI, 6.3-10.9]; P=4.2×10-14). Mendelian randomization suggested 
that inheritance of larger IVS cross-sectional area at diastole was strongly 
associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy risk (pIVW=4.6×10-10) while 
inheritance of smaller IVS cross-sectional area at diastole was associated with 
risk for ventricular septal defect (pIVW=0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Automated estimates of cross-sectional area of the IVS supports 
discovery of novel loci related to cardiac development and Mendelian disease. 
Inheritance of genetic liability for either small or large IVS, appears to 
confer risk for ventricular septal defect or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 
respectively. These data suggest that a proportion of risk for structural and 
congenital heart disease can be localized to the common genetic determinants of 
size and shape of cardiovascular anatomy.
