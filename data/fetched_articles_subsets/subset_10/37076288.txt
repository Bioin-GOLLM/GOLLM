While constitutional pathogenic variants in the APC gene cause familial 
adenomatous polyposis, APC c.3920T>A; p.Ile1307Lys (I1307K) has been associated 
with a moderate increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly in 
individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. However, published data include 
relatively small sample sizes, generating inconclusive results regarding cancer 
risk, particularly in non-Ashkenazi populations. This has led to different 
country/continental-specific guidelines regarding genetic testing, clinical 
management and surveillance recommendations for I1307K. A multidisciplinary 
international expert group endorsed by the International Society for 
Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT), has generated a position 
statement on the APC I1307K allele and its association with cancer 
predisposition. Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence 
published, the aim of this document is to summarise the prevalence of the APC 
I1307K allele and analysed the evidence of the associated cancer risk in 
different populations. Here we provide recommendations on the laboratory 
classification of the variant, define the role of predictive testing for I1307K, 
suggest recommendations for cancer screening in I1307K heterozygous and 
homozygous individuals and identify knowledge gaps to be addressed in future 
research studies. Briefly, I1307K, classified as pathogenic, low penetrance, is 
a risk factor for CRC in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish origin and should be 
tested in this population, offering carriers specific clinical surveillance. 
There is not enough evidence to support an increased risk of cancer in other 
populations/subpopulations. Therefore, until/unless future evidence indicates 
otherwise, individuals of non-Ashkenazi Jewish descent harbouring I1307K should 
be enrolled in national CRC screening programmes for average-risk individuals.
