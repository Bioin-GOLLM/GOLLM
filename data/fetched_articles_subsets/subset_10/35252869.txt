Rhabdoid tumors (RT) are rare and deadly pediatric cancers driven by loss of 
SMARCB1, which encodes the SNF5 component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler. 
Loss of SMARCB1 is associated with a complex set of phenotypic changes including 
vulnerability to inhibitors of protein synthesis and of the p53 ubiquitin-ligase 
HDM2. Recently, we discovered small molecule inhibitors of the 'WIN' site of 
WDR5, which in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells decrease the expression of a set of 
genes linked to protein synthesis, inducing a translational choke and causing 
p53-dependent inhibition of proliferation. Here, we characterize how WIN site 
inhibitors act in RT cells. As in leukemia cells, WIN site inhibition in RT 
cells causes the comprehensive displacement of WDR5 from chromatin, resulting in 
a decrease in protein synthesis gene expression. Unlike leukemia cells, however, 
the growth response of RT cells to WIN site blockade is independent of p53. 
Exploiting this observation, we demonstrate that WIN site inhibitor synergizes 
with an HDM2 antagonist to induce p53 and block RT cell proliferation in vitro. 
These data reveal a p53-independent action of WIN site inhibitors and forecast 
that future strategies to treat RT could be based on dual WDR5/HDM2 inhibition.
