We have carried out a study of breast cancer in Spanish families in which the 
entire coding region of the BRCA1 gene have been analyzed. To identify BRCA1 
mutations, PTT and CSGE methods were used followed by direct sequencing. We 
investigated 51 breast cancer women with a family history. Among these we have 
identified 7 frameshifts mutations (15%), 185delAG (4 times), 1623del5 and 
3450del4 (2 times), and 3 missense mutations, Ser1613Gly, Met1652Ile and 
Ala1708Glu, which are likely polymorphisms. These findings show that BRCA1 is 
implicated in a fraction of Spanish familial breast cancer similar to other 
countries. There was association between bilateral breast cancer and BRCA1 
mutations. The CSGE technique has been demonstrated to be a highly reliable 
method for mutation screening because of its sensitivity and high throughput.
