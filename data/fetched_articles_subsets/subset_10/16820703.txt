CD8+ CD25+-activated cytotoxic T cells and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) 
are independently involved in the severity of Hashimoto's disease (HD). 
Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) activates cytotoxic T cells. To evaluate the 
hypothesis that the functional +874A/T polymorphism in the gene encoding 
IFN-gamma is associated with the severity of HD, we examined the frequencies of 
this polymorphism in 34 HD patients who developed hypothyroidism (severe HD); 22 
untreated, euthyroid HD patients (mild HD); 49 patients with intractable Graves' 
disease (GD); 16 GD patients in remission; and 57 healthy volunteers. Frequency 
of the +874T allele, which is associated with high IFN-gamma production, was 
higher in patients with severe HD than in those with mild HD (odds ratio [OR], 
3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-12.4; p = 0.047), but there was no 
difference in the frequency between GD patients. The difference in the frequency 
of +874T was observed in the subset of patients with HD negative for TgAb (OR, 
8.4; 95% CI, 1.2-57.3; p = 0.029) but not in the subset of patients with HD 
positive for TgAb. Our data indicate that the +874A/T polymorphism in the 
IFN-gamma gene is associated with severity of HD.
