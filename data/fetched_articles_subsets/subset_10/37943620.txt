Transmembrane and tetratricopeptide repeat 4 (Tmtc4) is a deafness gene in mice. 
Tmtc4-KO mice have rapidly progressive postnatal hearing loss due to 
overactivation of the unfolded protein response (UPR); however, the cellular 
basis and human relevance of Tmtc4-associated hearing loss in the cochlea was 
not heretofore appreciated. We created a hair cell-specific conditional KO mouse 
that phenocopies the constitutive KO with postnatal onset deafness, 
demonstrating that Tmtc4 is a hair cell-specific deafness gene. Furthermore, we 
identified a human family in which Tmtc4 variants segregate with adult-onset 
progressive hearing loss. Lymphoblastoid cells derived from multiple affected 
and unaffected family members, as well as human embryonic kidney cells 
engineered to harbor each of the variants, demonstrated that the human Tmtc4 
variants confer hypersensitivity of the UPR toward apoptosis. These findings 
provide evidence that TMTC4 is a deafness gene in humans and further implicate 
the UPR in progressive hearing loss.
