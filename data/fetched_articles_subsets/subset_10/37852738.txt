Increased interleukin-6/C-reactive protein levels are associated with the 
upregulation of the adenosine pathway and serve as potential markers of 
therapeutic resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies in 
non-small cell lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Systemic immune activation, hallmarked by C-reactive protein (CRP) 
and interleukin-6 (IL-6), can modulate antitumor immune responses. In this 
study, we evaluated the role of IL-6 and CRP in the stratification of patients 
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs). We also interrogated the underlying immunosuppressive 
mechanisms driven by the IL-6/CRP axis.
METHODS: In cohort A (n=308), we estimated the association of baseline CRP with 
objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall 
survival (OS) in patients with NSCLC treated with ICIs alone or with 
chemo-immunotherapy (Chemo-ICI). Baseline tumor bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of 
lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) treated with pembrolizumab (cohort B, n=59) was 
used to evaluate differential expression of purine metabolism, as well as 
correlate IL-6 expression with PFS. CODEFACS approach was applied to deconvolve 
cohort B to characterize the tumor microenvironment by reconstructing the 
cell-type-specific transcriptome from bulk expression. Using the LUAD cohort 
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) we explored the correlation between IL-6 
expression and adenosine gene signatures. In a third cohort (cohort C, n=18), 
plasma concentrations of CRP, adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR), and IL-6 were 
measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: In cohort A, 67.2% of patients had a baseline CRP≥10 mg/L (CRP-H). 
Patients with CRP-H achieved shorter OS (8.6 vs 14.8 months; p=0.006), shorter 
PFS (3.3 vs 6.6 months; p=0.013), and lower ORR (24.7% vs 46.3%; p=0.015). After 
adjusting for relevant clinical variables, CRP-H was confirmed as an independent 
predictor of increased risk of death (HR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.11) and lower 
probability of achieving disease response (OR 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.89). In 
cohort B, RNA-seq analysis demonstrated higher IL-6 expression on tumor cells of 
non-responders, along with a shorter PFS (p<0.05) and enrichment of the 
purinergic pathway. Within the TCGA LUAD cohort, tumor IL-6 expression strongly 
correlated with the adenosine signature (R=0.65; p<2.2e-16). Plasma analysis in 
cohort C demonstrated that CRP-H patients had a greater median baseline level of 
A2aR (6.0 ng/mL vs 1.3 ng/mL; p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates CRP as a readily available blood-based 
prognostic biomarker in ICI-treated NSCLC. Additionally, we elucidate a 
potential link of the CRP/IL-6 axis with the immunosuppressive adenosine 
signature pathway that could drive inferior outcomes to ICIs in NSCLC and also 
offer novel therapeutic avenues.
