An approach for rapid HPLC-based profiling for new GABA (A) ligands of natural 
origin has been developed. Active extracts are separated by a single injection 
of 3-10 mg of extract onto a semi-preparative (150 x 10 mm i. d.) HPLC column 
with gradient elution and time-based fractionation. The microfractions are 
tested in an automated two-microelectrode voltage-clamp assay on Xenopus oocytes 
expressing recombinant GABA (A) channels composed of alpha (1), beta (2) and 
gamma (2S) subunits. The protocol has been validated by spiking experiments with 
inactive extract and the GABA (A) receptor ligand magnolol, and by profiling of 
active extracts such as valerian extract containing the known GABA (A) receptor 
ligand valerenic acid. For dereplication of GABA containing extracts, we 
established a rapid and simple procedure by which GABA is analyzed as OPA 
derivative by reversed-phase HPLC. This dereplication protocol was validated 
with plant and fungal extracts which had been previously tested active or 
inactive in the oocyte assay and with spiking experiments.
