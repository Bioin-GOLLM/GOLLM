The importance of IgG glycosylation has been known for many years not only by 
scientists in glycobiology but also by human pathogens that have evolved 
specific enzymes to modify these glycans with fundamental impact on IgG 
function. The rise of IgG as a major therapeutic scaffold for many cancer and 
immunological indications combined with the availability of unique enzymes 
acting specifically on IgG Fc-glycans have spurred a range of applications to 
study this important post-translational modification on IgG. This review article 
introduces why the IgG glycans are of distinguished interest, gives a background 
on the unique enzymatic tools available to study the IgG glycans and finally 
presents an overview of applications utilizing these enzymes for various 
modifications of the IgG glycans. The applications covered include site-specific 
glycan transglycosylation and conjugation, analytical workflows for monoclonal 
antibodies and serum diagnostics. Additionally, the review looks ahead and 
discusses the importance of O-glycosylation for IgG3, Fc-fusion proteins and 
other new formats of biopharmaceuticals.
