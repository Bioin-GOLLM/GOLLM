Relaxor-based ferroelectrics are prized for their giant electromechanical 
coupling and have revolutionized sensor and ultrasound applications. A 
long-standing challenge for piezoelectric materials has been to understand how 
these ultrahigh electromechanical responses occur when the polar atomic 
displacements underlying the response are partially broken into polar 
nanoregions (PNRs) in relaxor-based ferroelectrics. Given the complex 
inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed 
that this enhanced response must involve complicated interactions. By using 
neutron scattering measurements of lattice dynamics and local structure, we show 
that the vibrational modes of the PNRs enable giant coupling by softening the 
underlying macrodomain polarization rotations in relaxor-based ferroelectric 
PMN-xPT {(1 - x)[Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3] - xPbTiO3} (x = 30%). The mechanism involves 
the collective motion of the PNRs with transverse acoustic phonons and results 
in two hybrid modes, one softer and one stiffer than the bare acoustic phonon. 
The softer mode is the origin of macroscopic shear softening. Furthermore, a PNR 
mode and a component of the local structure align in an electric field; this 
further enhances shear softening, revealing a way to tune the ultrahigh 
piezoelectric response by engineering elastic shear softening.
