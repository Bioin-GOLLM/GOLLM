RATIONALE: Although metastases to the oral and maxillofacial region (OMR) are 
rare, the lung is the most common primary site metastasizing to the OMR.
PATIENT CONCERNS: An 83-year-old woman presented with reports of trismus, 
occlusal discomfort, swelling, and spontaneous pain in the right buccal region. 
Despite the absence of abnormal chest imaging findings, immunohistochemical 
analysis of biopsy specimens of the mandible and the thyroid indicated that the 
patient had multiple metastases from a lung poorly differentiated 
adenocarcinoma.
DIAGNOSES: Metastases to the OMR and the thyroid from an undiscovered lung 
adenocarcinoma.
INTERVENTIONS: Gefitinib was started as first-line chemotherapy, and zoledronic 
acid was administered for bone metastases.
OUTCOMES: Follow-up imaging examinations showed ossification and deformation of 
the right mandibular ramus and the condylar process. Although 2 years have 
passed since the first visit to our hospital, lung lesions have not been 
confirmed by imaging examinations.
LESSONS: Clinicians should consider the possibility that symptoms in the OMR may 
be the first clinical sign of an undiscovered distant primary tumor, and the 
primary tumors may not be detected by imaging examinations even when metastases 
to the OMR are revealed.
