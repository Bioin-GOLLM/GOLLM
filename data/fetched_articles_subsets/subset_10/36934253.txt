BACKGROUND: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVM) are a significant cause 
of intracranial hemorrhagic stroke and brain damage. The arteriovenous junctions 
in AVM nidus are known to have hemodynamic disturbances such as altered shear 
stress, which could lead to endothelial dysfunction. The molecular mechanisms 
coupling shear stress and endothelial dysfunction in cAVMs are poorly 
understood. We speculated that disturbed blood flow in artery-vein junctions 
activates Notch receptors and promotes endothelial mesenchymal plasticity during 
cAVM formation.
METHODS: We investigated the expression profile of endothelial mesenchymal 
transition (EndMT) and cell adhesion markers, as well as activated Notch 
receptors, in 18 human cAVM samples and 15 control brain tissues, by 
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical evaluation. 
Employing a combination of a microfluidic system, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, 
as well as invasion and inhibitor assays, the effects of various shear stress 
conditions on Notch-induced EndMT and invasive potential of human cerebral 
microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/d3) were analyzed.
RESULTS: We found evidence for EndMT and enhanced expression of activated Notch 
intracellular domain (NICD3 and NICD4) in human AVM nidus samples. The 
expression of transmembrane adhesion receptor integrin α9/β1 is significantly 
reduced in cAVM nidal vessels. Cell-cell adhesion proteins such as VE-cadherin 
and N-cadherin were differentially expressed in AVM nidus compared with control 
brain tissues. Using well-characterized hCMECs, we show that altered fluid shear 
stress steers Notch3 nuclear translocation and promotes SNAI1/2 expression and 
nuclear localization. Oscillatory flow downregulates integrin α9/β1 and 
VE-cadherin expression, while N-cadherin expression and endothelial cell 
invasiveness are augmented. Gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097, and to a lesser 
level DAPT, prevent the mesenchymal transition and invasiveness of cerebral 
microvascular endothelial cells exposed to oscillatory fluid flow.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides, for the first time, evidence for the role of 
oscillatory shear stress in mediating the EndMT process and dysregulated 
expression of cell adhesion molecules, especially multifunctional integrin α9/β1 
in human cAVM nidus. Concomitantly, our findings indicate the potential use of 
small-molecular inhibitors such as RO4929097 in the less-invasive therapeutic 
management of cAVMs.
