Albinism is a diverse group of hypopigmentary disorders caused by 
multiple-genetic defects. The genetic diagnosis of patients affected with 
albinism by Sanger sequencing is often complex, expensive, and time-consuming. 
In this study, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing to screen for 16 
genes in a patient with albinism, and identified 21 genetic variants, including 
19 known single nucleotide polymorphisms, one novel missense mutation (c.1456 
G>A), and one disease-causing mutation (c.478 G>C). The novel mutation was not 
observed in 100 controls, and was predicted to be a damaging mutation by SIFT 
and Polyphen. Thus, we identified a novel mutation in SLC45A2 in a Chinese 
family, expanding the mutational spectrum of albinism. Our results also 
demonstrate that targeted next-generation sequencing is an effective genetic 
test for albinism.
