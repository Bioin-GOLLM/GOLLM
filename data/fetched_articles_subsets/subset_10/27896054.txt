Adaptive evolution has provided us with a unique set of characteristics that 
define us as humans, including morphological, physiological and cellular 
changes. Yet, natural selection provides no assurances that adaptation is 
without human health consequences; advantageous mutations will increase in 
frequency so long as there is a net gain in fitness. As such, the current 
incidence of human disease can depend on previous adaptations. Here, I review 
genome-wide and gene-specific studies in which adaptive evolution has played a 
role in shaping human genetic disease. In addition to the disease consequences 
of adaptive phenotypes, such as bipedal locomotion and resistance to certain 
pathogens, I review evidence that adaptive mutations have influenced the 
frequency of linked disease alleles through genetic hitchhiking. Taken together, 
the links between human adaptation and disease highlight the importance of their 
combined influence on functional variation within the human genome and offer 
opportunities to discover and characterize such variation.
