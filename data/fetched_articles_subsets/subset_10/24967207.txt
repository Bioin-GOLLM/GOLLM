AIM: To study the associations between lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1) 
polymorphisms and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) remain inconsistent. In 
this study, we have performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association of 
LOXL1 polymorphisms with POAG risk.
METHODS: Published literature from PubMed and other databases were retrieved. 
All studies evaluating the association between LOXL1 polymorphisms (rs2165241, 
rs1048661, rs3825942) and POAG risk were included. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 
95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random- or fixed-effects 
model.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were identified as eligible articles, with thirteen 
(2098 cases and 16 473 controls), thirteen (1795 cases and 2916 controls) and 
sixteen population cohorts (2456 cases and 2846 controls) for the association of 
rs2165241, rs1048661 and rs3825942 with POAG risk respectively. Overall analyses 
showed no association between each LOXL1 polymorphism and POAG risk, and the 
negative associations were remained when the subjects were stratified as 
Caucasian and Asian. The heterozygote of rs2165241 was associated with reduced 
POAG risk in hospital-based populations (TC vs CC: OR, 0.79, 95%CI: 0.63-0.99), 
and rs1048661 was associated with increased POAG risk in hospital-based 
populations in a dominant model (TT vs CC+CT: OR, 1.23, 95%CI: 1.01-1.50); 
however, these associations were not found in population-based subjects.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that LOXL1 polymorphisms are not 
associated with POAG risk. Given the limited sample size, the associations of 
LOXL1 polymorphisms with POAG risk in hospital-based populations await further 
investigation.
