Teleost IgT/Z plays a principal role in the defense mechanisms against 
infectious agents in the mucosal compartments and in systemic immunity. 
Previously, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) IgT was discovered and 
characterized at transcription level. In this work, we generated a monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) that specifically recognized the Nile tilapia IgT. BALB/c mice 
were immunized with three synthetic peptides conjugated to KLH. The sequences of 
these peptides derived from the constant region of the Nile tilapia IgT heavy 
chain. ELISA and Western blotting confirmed the specificity of the polyclonal 
sera and the culture supernatant from a positive hybridoma clone. We observed 
immunoreactivity against a recombinant IgT fragment and native IgT in skin 
mucus. The anti-IgT mAb did not cross-react with purified tilapia IgM. Direct 
ELISA analysis allowed the quantification of skin mucus IgM and IgT 
concentrations. Flow cytometry analysis revealed differences in the percentage 
of IgT+ B cell populations between juveniles and adults in peripheral blood, 
head kidney and spleen lymphocytes and among the tissues analyzed. For further 
validation of the anti-IgT mAb utility, a recombinant vaccine candidate against 
sea lice (TT-P0 Ls) was injected into juvenile tilapia. Direct ELISA results 
revealed a differential secretion of skin mucus IgT and IgM after 
immunostimulation. In addition, the percentages of IgT+ B cells were determined 
at 7 days after booster and ex-vivo stimulation by flow cytometry. This mAb 
constitutes an important immunological tool to study the biological function and 
structural characteristics of tilapia IgT.
