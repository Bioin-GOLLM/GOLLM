BACKGROUND: Trigeminal neuralgia is accompanied by severe mechanical, thermal 
and chemical hypersensitivity of the orofacial area innervated by neurons of 
trigeminal ganglion (TG). We examined the role of the voltage-gated sodium 
channel subtype Nav1.9 in the development of trigeminal neuralgia.
RESULTS: We found that Nav1.9 is required for the development of both thermal 
and mechanical hypersensitivity induced by constriction of the infraorbital 
nerve (CION). The CION model does not induce change on Nav1.9 mRNA expression in 
the ipsilateral TG neurons when evaluated 9Â days after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that Nav1.9 channels play a critical role 
in the development of orofacial neuropathic pain. New routes for the treatment 
of orofacial neuropathic pain focussing on regulation of the voltage-gated 
Nav1.9 sodium channel activity should be investigated.
