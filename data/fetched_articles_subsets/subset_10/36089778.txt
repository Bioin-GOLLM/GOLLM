BACKGROUND: TLR3 polymorphisms affect the risk of HIV infection and modify the 
disease course. Consequently, we analyzed the association of TLR3 polymorphism 
(rs5743312, rs3775296, and rs3775291) with susceptilbity to HIV-1 acquisition 
and disease progression.
METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study. Genotyping of TLR3 polymorphisms were 
completed by the utilization of the PCR-RFLP technique in 153 HIV naive subjects 
and 158 healthy controls.
RESULT: A haplotype is a physical grouping of genomic variants that tend to be 
inherited together. The TCC haplotype was increased in HIV infected individuals 
compared with healthy controls (0.05% versus 0.03%). TLR3 rs3775291CT genotype 
was associated to the early stage of HIV infection (OR=2.19, P=0.04), with a 
higher occurrence in advance stage of HIV infection when contrasted with healthy 
controls (41.2% versus 32.3%). TLR3 rs3775296 CA genotype was likely to be 
associated with intermediate stage of HIV infection (19.5% versus 31.6%, 
OR=0.42, P=0.06). TLR3 rs5743312TT genotype was used to be greater prevalence in 
advanced stage of HIV infection compared with healthy controls (2.9% versus 
1.9%). TLR3 rs3775296CA genotype was less prevalent in HIV subjects devouring 
tobacco when contrasted with non-users (9.1% versus 34.9%, OR=0.25, P=0.09). 
TLR3 rs3775296AA and rs3775291CT and TT genotypes have been overrepresented in 
HIV subjects using alcohol when contrasted with non-users (5.6% versus 1.1%, 
OR=1.83, P=0.67; 50.0% versus 42.2%, OR=1.84, P=0.31; 5.6% versus 3.3%, OR=2.70, 
P=0.50). In multivariate examination, rs5743312TT genotype showed a greater risk 
for HIV infection (OR=1.86, P=0.50).
CONCLUSION: TLR3 rs3775291 C/T polymorphism may assist the risk of disease 
progression in alcohol consumers. TLR3 rs3775291 CT genotype may enhance the 
disease progression whereas the TLR3 rs3775296 CA genotype may protect for 
disease progression.
