High-throughput technologies have revolutionized medical research. The advent of 
genotyping arrays enabled large-scale genome-wide association studies and 
methods for examining global transcript levels, which gave rise to the field of 
"integrative genetics". Other omics technologies, such as proteomics and 
metabolomics, are now often incorporated into the everyday methodology of 
biological researchers. In this review, we provide an overview of such omics 
technologies and focus on methods for their integration across multiple omics 
layers. As compared to studies of a single omics type, multi-omics offers the 
opportunity to understand the flow of information that underlies disease.
