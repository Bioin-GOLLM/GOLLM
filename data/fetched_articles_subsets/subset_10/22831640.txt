Clathrin is considered the prototype vesicle coat protein whose self-assembly 
mediates sorting of membrane cargo and recruitment of lipid modifiers. Detailed 
knowledge of clathrin biochemistry, structure, and interacting proteins has 
accumulated since the first observation, almost 50 years ago, of its role in 
receptor-mediated endocytosis of yolk protein. This review summarizes that 
knowledge, and focuses on properties of the clathrin heavy and light chain 
subunits and interaction of the latter with Hip proteins, to address the 
diversity of clathrin function beyond conventional receptor-mediated 
endocytosis. The distinct functions of the two human clathrin isoforms (CHC17 
and CHC22) are discussed, highlighting CHC22's specialized involvement in 
traffic of the GLUT4 glucose transporter and consequent role in human glucose 
metabolism. Analysis of clathrin light chain function and interaction with the 
actin-binding Hip proteins during bacterial infection defines a novel 
actin-organizing function for CHC17 clathrin. By considering these diverse 
clathrin functions, along with intracellular sorting roles and influences on 
mitosis, further relevance of clathrin function to human health and disease is 
established.
