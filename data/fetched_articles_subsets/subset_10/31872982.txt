BACKGROUND: Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare dominantly inherited 
developmental disorder with an estimated prevalence of 0.5-10:100,000 and no 
racial disparity in prevalence. The aim of this study was to present two 
unrelated Chinese CdLS individuals with mutations in NIPBL and to perform a 
comprehensive analysis of a Chinese cohort with CdLS.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two unrelated Chinese patients complaining of short 
stature were referred to the outpatient department of Peking Union Medical 
College Hospital (PUMCH). Their clinical data at birth and at the most recent 
assessment were collected. Mutation analysis was carried out by whole exome 
sequencing. Twenty-four Chinese cases with CdLS were identified through a 
systematic review of the literature published between 1987 and 2017.
RESULTS: Two patients presented with typical phenotypes, characteristic 
complications of CdLS and mutations in the NIPBL gene. The average age at 
diagnosis of the 26 Chinese cases was higher than that of other cohorts. The 
frequencies of characteristic manifestations of CdLS were similar with those of 
other populations.
CONCLUSIONS: By investigating 26 Chinese cases of CdLS, we observed that the 
clinical data and gene variants in the Chinese cohort of CdLS patients were 
generally in accordance with those of other populations.
