BACKGROUND: Hepatic chemosaturation is a technique in which a high dose of the 
chemotherapeutic agent melphalan is administered directly into the liver while 
limiting systemic side effects. We reviewed our institutional experience 
regarding patient's X-ray exposure caused by the procedure.
METHODS: Fifty-five procedures, performed between 2016 and 2020 in 18 patients 
by three interventional radiologists (radiologist), were analyzed regarding the 
patient's exposure to radiation. Dose-area-product (DAP) and fluoroscopy time 
(FT) were correlated with the experience of the radiologist and whether the 
preprocedural evaluation (CS-EVA) and the procedure were performed by the same 
radiologist. Additionally, the impact of previous liver surgery on DAP/FT was 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Experienced radiologist require less DAP/FT 
(50 ± 18 Gy*cm2/13.2 ± 3.84 min vs. 69 ± 20 Gy*cm2/15.77 ± 7.82 min; p < 0.001). 
Chemosaturations performed by the same radiologist who performed CS-EVA required 
less DAP/FT (41 ± 12 Gy*cm2/11.46 ± 4.41 min vs. 
62 ± 11 Gy*cm2/15.55 ± 7.91 min; p < 0.001). Chemosaturations in patients with 
prior liver surgery with involvement of the inferior cava vein required 
significantly higher DAP/FT (153 ± 27 Gy*cm2/25.43 ± 4.57 min vs. 
56 ± 25 Gy*cm2/14.44 ± 7.55 min; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: There is a significant learning curve regarding the procedure of 
hepatic chemosaturation. Due to dose reduction the evaluation and 
chemosaturation therapy should be performed by the same radiologist. Procedures 
in patients with previous liver surgery require higher DAP/FT.
