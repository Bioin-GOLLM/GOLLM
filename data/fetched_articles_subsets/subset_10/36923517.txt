BACKGROUND: Weight loss and malnutrition are frequent findings in late-onset and 
sporadic presentations of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, less is known about 
nutritional status in Early-Onset Autosomal Dominant AD (EO-ADAD).
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between nutritional status and other 
clinical and sociodemographic characteristics in individuals with a genetic form 
of EO-ADAD.
DESIGN SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study with 75 
non-institutionalized participants from a cohort of Autosomal Dominant AD (13 
with mild cognitive impairment and 61 with dementia, ages from 38 to 67 years) 
underwent a structured clinical assessment with emphasis on nutritional status.
MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was nutritional status and it was measured using 
the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Patients were categorized according to 
MNA total score, as undernourished (MNA ≤23.5) and well-nourished (MNA ≥ 24). 
Sociodemographic and clinical variables identified as potential predictors or 
confounders of nutritional status were also collected.
RESULTS: Undernourishment by MNA was present in 57.3% of the sample. Forty-two 
percent of participants had abnormal BMI values considered lower than 18.5 or 
higher than 24.9 kg/m2. Total BMI values were similar in well and undernourished 
patients (median 24.2 IQR 3.59 and median 23.9 IQR 4.42, respectively, p=0.476). 
When comparing well and undernourished groups, we found statistically 
significant differences for variables: severity of dementia (p=0.034), frailty 
(p=0.001), multimorbidity (p=0.035) and, polymedication (p=0.045). Neither 
adjusted logistic regression nor the Poisson regression showed that any clinical 
or sociodemographic variables explained undernourishment.
CONCLUSIONS: Undernourishment was a frequent finding in our sample of EO-ADAD, 
especially in later stages of the disease. Patients with polymedication, 
multimorbidity, frailty and severe dementia show differences in their 
nutritional status with a tendency to be more frequently undernourished. Further 
studies with larger sample sizes are needed to establish this association.
