BACKGROUND: Several recent randomized clinical trials have preliminarily 
demonstrated that initial targeted therapy with combined BRAF and MEK inhibition 
is more effective in metastatic melanoma (MM) than single agent. To guide 
therapeutic decisions, we did a comprehensive network meta-analysis to identify 
evidence to robustly support whether combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is the 
best initial targeted therapeutic strategy for patients with MM.
METHODS: The databases of PubMed and trial registries were researched for 
randomized clinical trials of targeted therapy. Data of outcome were extracted 
on progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and overall 
survival (OS). Network meta-analysis using a Bayesian statistical model was 
performed to evaluate relative hazard ratio (HR) for PFS and OS, odds ratio (OR) 
for ORR.
RESULTS: Finally, 16 eligible trials comprising 5976 participants were included 
in this meta-analysis. PFS were significantly prolonged in patients who received 
combined BRAF-MEK inhibition compared with those who received BRAF inhibition 
(HR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.51-0.67, P < 0.0001) or MEK inhibition alone (HR: 0.29, 
95%CI: 0.22-0.37, P < 0.0001). Combined BRAF-MEK inhibition also improved the OS 
over BRAF inhibition (HR: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.56-0.81, P < 0.0001) or MEK inhibition 
alone (HR: 0.48, 95%CI: 0.36-0.65, P < 0.0001). The ORR was superior in combined 
BRAF and MEK inhibition comparing with BRAF inhibition (OR: 2.00, 95%CI: 
1.66-2.44, P < 0.0001) or MEK inhibition alone (OR: 20.66, 95%CI: 12.22-35.47, P 
< 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that concurrent inhibition of BRAF and MEK 
improved the most effective therapeutic modality as compared as single BRAF or 
MEK inhibition for patients with MM.
