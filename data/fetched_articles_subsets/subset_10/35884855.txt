Various genomic variants were linked to inherited peripheral neuropathies 
(IPNs), including large duplication/deletion and repeat expansion, making 
genetic diagnosis challenging. This large case series aimed to identify the 
genetic characteristics of Japanese patients with IPNs. We collected data on 
2695 IPN cases throughout Japan, in which PMP22 copy number variation (CNV) was 
pre-excluded. Genetic analyses were performed using DNA microarrays, 
next-generation sequencing-based gene panel sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, 
CNV analysis, and RFC1 repeat expansion analysis. The overall diagnostic rate 
and the genetic spectrum of patients were summarized. We identified 909 cases 
with suspected IPNs, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The most common 
causative genes were MFN2, GJB1, MPZ, and MME. MFN2 was the most common cause 
for early-onset patients, whereas GJB1 and MPZ were the leading causes of 
middle-onset and late-onset patients, respectively. Meanwhile, GJB1 and MFN2 
were leading causes for demyelinating and axonal subtypes, respectively. 
Additionally, we identified CNVs in MPZ and GJB1 genes and RFC1 repeat 
expansions. Comprehensive genetic analyses explicitly demonstrated the genetic 
basis of our IPN case series. A further understanding of the clinical 
characteristics of IPN and genetic spectrum would assist in developing efficient 
genetic testing strategies and facilitate early diagnosis.
