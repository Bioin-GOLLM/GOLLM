BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer is a urological carcinoma with high incidence, among 
which muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a malignant carcinoma with high 
mortality. There is an urgent need to develop new drugs with low toxicity and 
high efficiency for MIBC because existing medication has defects, such as high 
toxicity, poor efficacy, and side effects. Jorunnamycin A (JorA), a natural 
marine compound, has been found to have a high efficiency anticancer effect, but 
its anticancer function and mechanism on bladder cancer have not been studied.
METHODS: To examine the anticancer effect of JorA on MIBC, Cell Counting Kit 8, 
EdU staining, and colony formation analyses were performed. Moreover, a 
xenograft mouse model was used to verify the anticancer effect in vivo. To 
investigate the pharmacological mechanism of JorA, high-throughput quantitative 
proteomics, transcriptomics, RT-qPCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence 
staining, flow cytometry, pulldown assays, and molecular docking were performed.
RESULTS: JorA inhibited the proliferation of MIBC cells, and the IC50 of T24 and 
UM-UC-3 was 0.054 and 0.084 μM, respectively. JorA-induced significantly changed 
proteins were enriched in "cancer-related pathways" and "EGFR-related signaling 
pathways", which mainly manifested by inhibiting cell proliferation and 
promoting cell apoptosis. Specifically, JorA dampened the DNA synthesis rate, 
induced phosphatidylserine eversion, and inhibited cell migration. Furthermore, 
it was discovered that fatty acid synthase (FASN) and topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) are 
the JorA interaction proteins. Using DockThor software, the 3D docking 
structures of JorA binding to FASN and TOP1 were obtained (the binding 
affinities were - 8.153 and - 7.264 kcal/mol, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The marine compound JorA was discovered to have a specific 
inhibitory effect on MIBC, and its potential pharmacological mechanism was 
revealed for the first time. This discovery makes an important contribution to 
the development of new high efficiency and low toxicity drugs for bladder cancer 
therapy.
