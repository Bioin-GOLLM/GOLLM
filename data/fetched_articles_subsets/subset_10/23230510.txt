Gene targeting in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has become the principal 
technology for generating knockout models. Although numerous studies have 
predicted that the disruption of p53 leads to increased developmental anomalies 
and malignancies, most p53 knockout mice develop normally. Therefore, the role 
of p53 in animal development was examined using rat knockout models. 
Conventionally generated homozygous KO males developed normally, whereas females 
rarely survived due to neural tube defects. Mutant chimeras generated via 
blastocyst injection with p53-null ESCs exhibited high rates of embryonic 
lethality in both sexes. This phenotype could be observed in one month by the 
use of zinc-finger nucleases. The p53-null ESCs were resistant to apoptosis and 
differentiation, and exhibited severe chromosome instabilities in the 
chimera-contributed cells, suggesting an essential role for p53 in maintaining 
ESC quality and genomic integrity. These results demonstrate that p53 functions 
as a guardian of embryogenesis in the rats.
