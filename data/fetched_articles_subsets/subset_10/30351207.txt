AIMS: To validate a laboratory-developed test for the nucleoside transporter, 
SLC28A3, which has been associated with an increased risk of 
anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy.
METHODS: We used Taqman® allele discrimination to test for two variants of the 
SLC28A3 gene: rs7853758 (c.1381C>T) and rs885004 (c.862-360C>T).
RESULTS: During the validation process, we noted that several DNA samples 
obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ) were positive for both 
the c.1381 C > T and c.862-360C>T variants and another variant allele for either 
c.1381 C > T or c.862-360C>T (e.g., c.1381C>T homozygous/c.862-360C>T 
heterozygous, c.1381C>T homozygous/c.862-360C>T homozygous). We used 
de-identified DNA samples from trios of family members (mother, father, and 
child) to establish that the c.1381 C > T and c.862-360C>T variant alleles could 
be inherited in cis on the same chromosome.
CONCLUSIONS: Samples containing three variant alleles suggest that the c.1381 
C > T and c.862-360C>T are in cis on the chromosome in some individuals and may 
have implications when calculating anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy risk. In 
this study, we confirm a novel haplotype of SLC28A3 using familial studies.
