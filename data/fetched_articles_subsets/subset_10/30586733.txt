BACKGROUND: The relative prevalence and clinical importance of monogenic 
mutations related to familial hypercholesterolemia and of high polygenic score 
(cumulative impact of many common variants) pathways for early-onset myocardial 
infarction remain uncertain. Whole-genome sequencing enables simultaneous 
ascertainment of both monogenic mutations and polygenic score for each 
individual.
METHODS: We performed deep-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 2081 patients 
from 4 racial subgroups hospitalized in the United States with early-onset 
myocardial infarction (age â‰¤55 years) recruited with a 2:1 female-to-male 
enrollment design. We compared these genomes with those of 3761 population-based 
control subjects. We first identified individuals with a rare, monogenic 
mutation related to familial hypercholesterolemia. Second, we calculated a 
recently developed polygenic score of 6.6 million common DNA variants to 
quantify the cumulative susceptibility conferred by common variants. We defined 
high polygenic score as the top 5% of the control distribution because this 
cutoff has previously been shown to confer similar risk to that of familial 
hypercholesterolemia mutations.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 2081 patients presenting with early-onset 
myocardial infarction was 48 years, and 66% were female. A familial 
hypercholesterolemia mutation was present in 36 of these patients (1.7%) and was 
associated with a 3.8-fold (95% CI, 2.1-6.8; P<0.001) increased odds of 
myocardial infarction. Of the patients with early-onset myocardial infarction, 
359 (17.3%) carried a high polygenic score, associated with a 3.7-fold (95% CI, 
3.1-4.6; P<0.001) increased odds. Mean estimated untreated low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol was 206 mg/dL in those with a familial 
hypercholesterolemia mutation, 132 mg/dL in those with high polygenic score, and 
122 mg/dL in those in the remainder of the population. Although associated with 
increased risk in all racial groups, high polygenic score demonstrated the 
strongest association in white participants ( P for heterogeneity=0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Both familial hypercholesterolemia mutations and high polygenic 
score are associated with a >3-fold increased odds of early-onset myocardial 
infarction. However, high polygenic score has a 10-fold higher prevalence among 
patients presents with early-onset myocardial infarction.
