The PD-1 pathway regulates dysfunctional T cells in chronic infection and 
cancer, but the role of this pathway during acute infection remains less clear. 
Here, we demonstrate that PD-1 signals are needed for optimal memory. Mice 
deficient in the PD-1 pathway exhibit impaired CD8+ T cell memory following 
acute influenza infection, including reduced virus-specific CD8+ T cell numbers 
and compromised recall responses. PD-1 blockade during priming leads to similar 
differences early post-infection but without the defect in memory formation, 
suggesting that timing and/or duration of PD-1 blockade could be tailored to 
modulate host responses. Our studies reveal a role for PD-1 as an integrator of 
CD8+ T cell signals that promotes CD8+ T cell memory formation and suggest PD-1 
continues to fine-tune CD8+ T cells after they migrate into non-lymphoid 
tissues. These findings have important implications for PD-1-based 
immunotherapy, in which PD-1 inhibition may influence memory responses in 
patients.
