Activating B-Raf mutations that deregulate the MAPK pathway commonly occur in 
cancer. Whether additional proteins modulate the enzymatic activity of oncogenic 
B-Raf is unknown. Here we show that the proto-oncogene C-Raf paradoxically 
inhibits B-Raf(V600E) kinase activity through the formation of 
B-Raf(V600E)-C-Raf complexes. Although all Raf family members associate with 
oncogenic B-Raf, this inhibitory effect is specific to C-Raf. Indeed, a 
B-Raf(V600E) isoform with impaired ability to interact with C-Raf exhibits 
elevated oncogenic potential. Human melanoma cells expressing B-Raf(V600E) 
display a reduced C-Raf:B-Raf ratio, and further suppression of C-Raf increases 
MAPK activation and proliferation. Conversely, ectopic C-Raf expression lowers 
ERK phosphorylation and proliferation. Moreover, both oncogenic Ras and 
Sorafenib stabilize B-Raf(V600E)-C-Raf complexes, thereby impairing MAPK 
activation. This inhibitory function of C-Raf on B-Raf(V600E)-mediated MAPK 
activation may explain the lack of co-occurrence of B-Raf(V600E) and oncogenic 
Ras mutations, and influence the successful clinical development of small 
molecule inhibitors for B-Raf(V600E)-driven cancers.
