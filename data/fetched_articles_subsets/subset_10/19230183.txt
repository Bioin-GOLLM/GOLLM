The authors studied drug sensitivity, mutations in the katG, in-hA, alpC, rpoB 
genes, virulence via the cytotoxicity test on THP-1 cells, and the viability and 
genetic affiliation of 53 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates versus data on the 
form and dynamics of a process. Sensitive and resistant strains did not 
significantly differ in viability and cytotoxicity. The highest death of 
infected macrophages was observed was seen with infection of M. tuberculosis of 
the Beijing B0 genotype, the least one seen with that of LAM with the similar 
rate of multiple drug resistance. There was a correlation of the changes in the 
count of lymphocytes in patients with the genetic affiliation of a causative 
agent. The severest course of the tuberculous process was observed in baseline 
lymphopenia (before treatment) in combination with multidrug resistance of 
mycobacteria, high and moderate cytotoxicity and high viability. Ser-Leu 531 
mutation resulted in cross resistance to rifampicin and mycobutin in most cases.
