We describe a family with QARS deficiency due to compound heterozygous QARS 
mutations, including c.1387G > A (p.R463*) in the catalytic core domain and 
c.2226C > G (p.Q742H) in the anticodon domain, both previously unreported and 
predicted damaging. The phenotype of the male index further confirms this 
specific aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase disorder as a novel genetic 
cause of progressive microcephaly with diffuse cerebral atrophy, severely 
deficient myelination, intractable seizures, and developmental arrest. However, 
in contrast to the two hitherto published families, the cerebellum and its 
myelination are not affected. An awareness that QARS mutations may cause 
isolated supratentorial changes is crucial for properly directing genetic 
analysis.
