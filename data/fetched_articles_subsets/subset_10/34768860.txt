Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune dermatosis of which the pathogenesis remains 
scarcely known. A wide variety of clinical studies have been proposed to 
investigate the immune mediators which have shown the most recurrency. However, 
such trials have produced controversial results. The aim of this review is to 
summarize the main factors involved in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, the latest 
findings regarding the cytokines involved and to evaluate the treatments based 
on the use of biological drugs in order to stop disease progression and achieve 
repigmentation. According to the results, the most recurrent studies dealt with 
inhibitors of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. It is possible that, given the great deal 
of cytokines involved in the lesion formation process of vitiligo, other 
biologics could be developed in the future to be used as adjuvants and/or to 
entirely replace the treatments that have proven to be unsatisfactory so far.
