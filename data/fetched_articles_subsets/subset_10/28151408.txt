Human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified 
thousands of susceptibility loci for common diseases with complex genetic 
etiologies. Although the susceptibility variants identified by GWAS usually have 
only modest effects on individual disease risk, they contribute to a substantial 
burden of trait variation in the overall population. GWAS also offer valuable 
clues to disease mechanisms that have long proven to be elusive. These insights 
could lead the way to breakthrough treatments; however, several challenges 
hinder progress, making innovative approaches to accelerate the follow-up of 
results from GWAS an urgent priority. Here, we discuss the largely untapped 
potential of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, for functional 
investigation of findings from human GWAS. We highlight selected examples where 
strong genomic conservation with humans along with the rapid and powerful 
genetic tools available for flies have already facilitated fine mapping of 
association signals, elucidated gene mechanisms, and revealed novel 
disease-relevant biology. We emphasize current research opportunities in this 
rapidly advancing field, and present bioinformatic analyses that systematically 
explore the applicability of Drosophila for interrogation of susceptibility 
signals implicated in more than 1000 human traits, based on all GWAS completed 
to date. Thus, our discussion is targeted at both human geneticists seeking 
innovative strategies for experimental validation of findings from GWAS, as well 
as the Drosophila research community, by whom ongoing investigations of the 
implicated genes will powerfully inform our understanding of human disease.
