Wnt signaling is ubiquitously activated in colorectal tumors and driver 
mutations are identified in genes such as APC, CTNNB1, RNF43 and R-spondin 
(RSPO2/3). Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and CTNNB1 mutations lead to 
downstream constitutive activation (ligand-independent), while RNF43 and RSPO 
mutations require exogenous Wnt ligand to activate signaling (ligand-dependent). 
Here, we present evidence that these mutations are not equivalent and that 
ligand-dependent and ligand-independent tumors differ in terms of underlying Wnt 
biology, molecular pathogenesis, morphology and prognosis. These non-overlapping 
characteristics can be harnessed to develop biomarkers and targeted treatments 
for ligand-dependent tumors, including porcupine inhibitors, anti-RSPO3 
antibodies and asparaginase. There is emerging evidence that these therapies may 
synergize with immunotherapy in ligand-dependent tumors. In summary, we propose 
that ligand-dependent tumors are an underappreciated separate disease entity in 
colorectal cancer.
