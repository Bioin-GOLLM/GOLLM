In order to explore the clinical efficacy of DOTATATE imaging combined with CGA 
and BSP in the diagnosis of bone metastasis in patients with NENs, a total of 
100 NEN patients treated in our hospital from January 2021 to January 2022 were 
analyzed. All patients are divided into bone metastasis group and nonmetastasis 
group according to pathological examination results. The differences of DOTATATE 
imaging, CGA, and BSP are compared, and ROC curves are obtained to analyze the 
clinical efficacy of the three indicators in single application and combined 
diagnosis. The results show that AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of DOTATATE, 
BSP, and CGA combined diagnosis are higher than those of single diagnosis (P < 
0.05). It is clearly evident that DOTATATE test, BSP, and CGA can obtain 
accurate results in the diagnosis of bone metastasis in NEN patients, and those 
combined diagnosis can improve the diagnostic efficiency.
