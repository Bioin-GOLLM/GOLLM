PURPOSE: Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare cancer entity, with mutations in 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes accounting for ~ 10% of patients. Multiple-gene sequencing 
has already entered clinical practice for female breast cancer, whereas the 
performance of panel testing in MBC has not been studied extensively. Therefore, 
the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of panel testing for 
MBC, by the largest gene panel used so far, through investigation of patients 
deriving from a population with known founder effects.
METHODS: Genomic DNA from one hundred and two Greek MBC patients, unselected for 
age and family history, was used to prepare libraries which capture the entire 
coding regions of 94 cancer genes.
RESULTS: Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations were found in 12.7% of the cases, 
distributed in six genes: BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, CHEK2, PMS2, and FANCL. BRCA2 
mutations were the most frequent, followed by ATM mutations, accounting for 6.9 
and 2%, respectively, while mutations in other genes were detected in single 
cases. Age at diagnosis or family history was not predictive of mutation status. 
Beyond mutations in established breast cancer predisposing genes, LoF mutations 
in PMS2 and FANCL among MBC patients are reported here for the first time.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, using the largest gene panel for MBC patients so far, 
indicate that BRCA testing should be the primary concern for MBC patients. Until 
sufficient evidence arises from larger studies, multiple-gene panels may be of 
limited benefit for MBC and their families, at least for MBC patients of 
specific descent.
