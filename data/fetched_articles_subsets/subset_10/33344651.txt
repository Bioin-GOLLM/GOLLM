BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Radix Rehmanniae and Corni Fructus (RC) have been widely 
applied to treat diabetic nephropathy (DN) for centuries. But the mechanism of 
how RC plays the therapeutic role against DN is unclear as yet.
METHODS: The information about RC was obtained from a public database. The 
active compounds of RC were screened by oral bioavailability (OB) and 
drug-likeness (DL). Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed to realize the key 
targets of RC, and an active compound-potential target network was created. The 
therapeutic effects of RC active compounds and their key signal pathways were 
preliminarily probed via network pharmacology analysis and animal experiments.
RESULTS: In this study, 29 active compounds from RC and 64 key targets related 
to DN were collected using the network pharmacology method. The pathway 
enrichment analysis showed that RC regulated advanced glycosylation end product 
(AGE-) RAGE and IL-17 signaling pathways to treat DN. The animal experiments 
revealed that RC significantly improved metabolic parameters, inflammation renal 
structure, and function to protect the kidney against DN.
CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed the relationship between multicomponents and 
multitargets of RC. The administratiom of RC might remit the DM-induced renal 
damage through the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway to improve metabolic parameters 
and protect renal structure and function.
