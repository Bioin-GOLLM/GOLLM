BACKGROUND: Hyperparathyroidism-Jaw Tumor (HPT-JT) is caused by inactivating 
germline mutations of CDC73. This hereditary disease can present with a range of 
symptoms. Jaw ossifying fibroma (OF) is one of the most important clinical 
presentations, affecting 30% of HPT-JT patients. However, OF is easily confused 
with other fibro-osseous lesions (FOLs) of the jaw. The correct diagnosis of 
HPT-JT is a real challenge and must be confirmed by genetic testing.
CASE PRESENTATION: A female proband and her father suffered from multiple and 
recurrent FOLs in the jaw. Considering well demarcated margin and heterogeneous 
calcified substance lying in a variable density of fibrous stroma, we reached 
the diagnosis of jaw OF through radiologic and microscopic analyses. 
Additionally, the proband presented with chronic anemia resulting from 
menorrhagia, as well as renal mixed epithelial and stromal tumor (MEST). Two 
patients both presented with no evidence of Hyperparathyroidism (HPT). A 
germline start codon mutation (c.1A > G) of CDC73 was identified in them. Copy 
number loss at the CDC73 gene locus was verified in the jaw tumor sample of the 
proband.
CONCLUSION: Regardless of whether HPT manifestations are present, patients with 
heritable jaw OF may be at risk for HPT-JT. Genetic testing should be adopted to 
confirm the diagnosis. Early recognition of HPT-JT helps to better develop 
tailored treatment plans and surveillance programs.
