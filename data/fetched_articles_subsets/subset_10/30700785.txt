SANT domains are found in a number of chromatin regulators. They contain 
approximately 50 amino acids and have high similarity to the DNA binding domain 
of Myb related proteins. Though some SANT domains associate with DNA others have 
been found to bind unmodified histone tails. There are two SANT domains in 
Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2), the catalytic subunit of the Polycomb Repressive 
Complex 2 (PRC2), of unknown function. Here we show that the first SANT domain 
(SANT1) of EZH2 is a histone binding domain with specificity for the histone H4 
N-terminal tail. Using NMR spectroscopy, mutagenesis, and molecular modeling we 
structurally characterize the SANT1 domain and determine the molecular mechanism 
of binding to the H4 tail. Though not important for histone binding, we find 
that the adjacent stimulation response motif (SRM) stabilizes SANT1 and 
transiently samples its active form in solution. Acetylation of H4K16 (H4K16ac) 
or acetylation or methylation of H4K20 (H4K20ac and H4K20me3) are seen to 
abrogate binding of SANT1 to H4, which is consistent with these modifications 
being anti-correlated with H3K27me3 in-vivo. Our results provide significant 
insight into this important regulatory region of EZH2 and the first 
characterization of the molecular mechanism of SANT domain histone binding.
