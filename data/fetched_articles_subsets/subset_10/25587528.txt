Gilbert syndrome is the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin 
glucuronidation. It is characterized by intermittent episodes of jaundice in the 
absence of hepatocellular disease or hemolysis. Hereditary spherocytosis is the 
most common inherited hemolytic anemia and is characterized by spherical, 
osmotically fragile erythrocytes that are selectively trapped by the spleen. The 
patients have variable degrees of anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. Hereditary 
spherocytosis usually leads to mild-to-moderate elevation of serum bilirubin 
levels. Severe hyperbilirubinemia compared with the degree of hemolysis should 
be lead to suspicion of additional clinical conditions such as Gilbert syndrome 
or thalassemia. We present the case of a 12-year-old boy with extreme jaundice 
and nausea. The diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis was confirmed by osmotic 
fragility test results and that of Gilbert syndrome by genetic analysis 
findings.
