OBJECTIVES: The soluble epoxide hydrolase (gene name EPHX2) is responsible for 
metabolism of 8,9 11,12 and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, vasodilator and 
anti-inflammatory substances. There are several functional polymorphisms in the 
EPHX2 gene: two of them, the K55R and R287Q, showing an altered metabolic 
activity in vitro, were associated with coronary heart disease and ischemic 
stroke in previous studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
four polymorphisms in the EPHX2 gene on blood pressure levels, hypertension 
prevalence, and risk of incident cardiovascular events in a large sample of 
middle-aged Swedes.
METHODS: The incidence of cardiovascular events (coronary events, n = 274; 
ischemic stroke, n = 197) was monitored over 10 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: In the whole population, all polymorphisms had no effect on the studied 
parameters but a positive interaction between male sex and three SNPs including 
the K55R was evident: male, but not female, EPHX2 R55R homozygotes had 
significantly higher crude and adjusted systolic blood pressure and higher 
hypertension prevalence with respect to K-carriers. Kaplan-Meier curves showed 
higher incidence of ischemic strokes in male R55R homozygotes with respect to 
K-carriers (P = 0.015 by log-rank test). After adjustment for major 
cardiovascular risk factors, the hazard ratio for incident ischemic stroke in 
male R55R homozygotes remained significantly higher (hazard ratio: 4.8; 95% 
confidence interval: 1.2-19.9).
CONCLUSION: The functional K55R polymorphism of the EPHX2 gene confers a higher 
risk of hypertension prevalence and increases the risk of incident ischemic 
stroke in male homozygotes. Additional studies are needed to confirm these data 
and to elucidate the interaction between sex and the EPHX2 K55R polymorphism.
