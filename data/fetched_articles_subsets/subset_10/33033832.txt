BACKGROUND: Rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix [RV1]) has reduced diarrhea-associated 
hospitalizations and deaths in Malawi. We examined the trends in circulating 
rotavirus genotypes in Malawi over a 22-year period to assess the impact of RV1 
introduction on strain distribution.
METHODS: Data on rotavirus-positive stool specimens among children aged <5 years 
hospitalized with diarrhea in Blantyre, Malawi before (July 1997-October 2012, n 
= 1765) and after (November 2012-October 2019, n = 934) RV1 introduction were 
analyzed. Rotavirus G and P genotypes were assigned using reverse-transcription 
polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: A rich rotavirus strain diversity circulated throughout the 22-year 
period; Shannon (H') and Simpson diversity (D') indices did not differ between 
the pre- and postvaccine periods (H' P < .149; D' P < .287). Overall, G1 (n = 
268/924 [28.7%]), G2 (n = 308/924 [33.0%]), G3 (n = 72/924 [7.7%]), and G12 (n = 
109/924 [11.8%]) were the most prevalent genotypes identified following RV1 
introduction. The prevalence of G1P[8] and G2P[4] genotypes declined each 
successive year following RV1 introduction, and were not detected after 2018. 
Genotype G3 reemerged and became the predominant genotype from 2017 onward. No 
evidence of genotype selection was observed 7 years post-RV1 introduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus strain diversity and genotype variation in Malawi are 
likely driven by natural mechanisms rather than vaccine pressure.
