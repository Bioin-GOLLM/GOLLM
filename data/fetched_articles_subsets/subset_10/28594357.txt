This study presents pioneering data concerning the human pregnancy-associated 
glycoprotein-Like family, identified in the genome, of the term placental 
transcriptome and proteome. RNA-seq allowed the identification of 1364 bp 
hPAG-L/pep cDNA with at least 56.5% homology with other aspartic proteinases 
(APs). In silico analyses revealed 388 amino acids (aa) of full-length hPAG-L 
polypeptide precursor, with 15 aa-signal peptide, 47 aa-blocking peptide and 326 
aa-mature protein, and two Asp residues (D), specific for a catalytic cleft of 
the APs (VVFDTGSSNLWV91-102 and AIVDTGTSLLTG274-285). Capillary sequencing 
identified 9330 bp of the hPAG-L gene (Gen Bank Acc. No. KX533473), composed of 
nine exons and eight introns. Heterologous Western blotting revealed the 
presence of one dominant 60 kDa isoform of the hPAG-L amongst cellular placental 
proteins. Detection with anti-pPAG-P and anti-Rec pPAG2 polyclonals allowed 
identification of the hPAG-L proteins located within regions of chorionic villi, 
especially within the syncytiotrophoblast of term singleton placentas. Our novel 
data extend the present knowledge about the human genome, as well as placental 
transcriptome and proteome during term pregnancy. Presumably, this may 
contribute to establishing a new diagnostic tool for examination of some 
disturbances during human pregnancy, as well as growing interest from both 
scientific and clinical perspectives.
