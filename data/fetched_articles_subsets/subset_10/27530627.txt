Two different forms of clinical paratuberculosis in sheep are recognised, 
related to the level of bacterial colonization. Paucibacillary lesions are 
largely composed of lymphocytes with few bacteria, and multibacillary pathology 
is characterized by heavily-infected macrophages. Analysis of cytokine 
transcripts has shown that inflammatory Th1/Th17 T cells are associated with 
development of paucibacillary pathology and Th2 cytokines are correlated with 
multibacillary disease. The master regulator T cell transcription factors TBX21, 
GATA3, RORC2 and RORA are critical for the development of these T cell subsets. 
Sequence variations of the transcription factors have also been implicated in 
the distinct disease forms of human mycobacterial and gastrointestinal 
inflammatory diseases. Relative RT-qPCR was used to compare expression levels of 
each transcript variant of the master regulators in the ileo-caecal lymph nodes 
of uninfected controls and sheep with defined paucibacillary and multibacillary 
pathology. Low levels of GATA3 in multibacillary sheep failed to confirm that 
multibacillary paratuberculosis is caused simply by a Th2 immune response. 
However, high levels of TBX21, RORC2 and RORC2v1 highlights the role of Th1 and 
Th17 activation in paucibacillary disease. Increased RORAv1 levels in 
paucibacillary tissue suggests a role for RORα in Th17 development in sheep; 
while elevated levels of RORAv4 hints that this variant might inhibit RORα 
function and depress Th17 development in multibacillary sheep.
