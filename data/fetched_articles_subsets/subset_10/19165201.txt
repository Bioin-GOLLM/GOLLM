LKB1/STK11 is a multitasking tumour suppressor kinase. Germline inactivating 
mutations of the gene are responsible for the Peutz-Jeghers hereditary cancer 
syndrome. It is also somatically inactivated in approximately 30% of 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we report that LKB1/KRAS mutant NSCLC 
cell lines are sensitive to the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 shown by a dose-dependent 
reduction in proliferation rate, whereas LKB1 and KRAS mutations alone do not 
confer similar sensitivity. We show that this subset of NSCLC is also sensitised 
to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Importantly, the data suggest that LKB1/KRAS 
mutant NSCLCs are a genetically and functionally distinct subset and further 
suggest that this subset of lung cancers might afford an opportunity for 
exploitation of anti-MAPK/mTOR-targeted therapies.
