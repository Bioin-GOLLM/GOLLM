In this study we report the number and location of the glycans on PST. Urea PAGE 
and SDS-PAGE have been used to follow the enzymatic removal of sialic acids and 
of glycans from PST and the masses of native and deglycosylated PST have been 
determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. The results are consistent with 
the presence of a single biantennary glycan chain. As amino acid sequence 
analysis demonstrated the absence of a glycosylated asparagine at position 25, 
the glycosylation site is restricted to Asp-497.
