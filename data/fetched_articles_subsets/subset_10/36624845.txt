Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) can originate from either fallopian tube 
epithelial (FTE) or ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells, but with different 
latencies and disease outcomes. To address the basis of these differences, we 
performed single cell RNA-sequencing of mouse cells isolated from the distal 
half of fallopian tube (FT) and surface layer of ovary. We find at the molecular 
level, FTE secretory stem/progenitor cells and OSE cells resemble mammary 
luminal progenitors and basal cells, respectively. An FT stromal subpopulation, 
enriched with Pdgfra + and Esr1 + cells, expresses multiple secreted factor 
(e.g., IGF1) and Hedgehog pathway genes and may serve as a niche for FTE cells. 
In contrast, Lgr5 + OSE cells express similar genes largely by themselves, 
raising a possibility that they serve as their own niche. The differences in 
intrinsic expression programs and niche organizations of FTE and OSE cells may 
contribute to their different courses toward the development of EOCs.
