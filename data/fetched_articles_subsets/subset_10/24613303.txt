Mature human adenovirus particles contain four minor capsid proteins, in 
addition to the three major capsid proteins (penton base, hexon and fiber) and 
several proteins associated with the genomic core of the virion. Of the minor 
capsid proteins, VI plays several crucial roles in the infection cycle of the 
virus, including hexon nuclear targeting during assembly, activation of the 
adenovirus proteinase (AVP) during maturation and endosome escape following cell 
entry. VI is translated as a precursor (pVI) that is cleaved at both N- and 
C-termini by AVP. Whereas the role of the C-terminal fragment of pVI, pVIc, is 
well established as an important co-factor of AVP, the role of the N-terminal 
fragment, pVIn, is currently elusive. In fact, the fate of pVIn following 
proteolytic cleavage is completely unknown. Here, we use a combination of 
proteomics-based peptide identification, native mass spectrometry and 
hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to show that pVIn is associated 
with mature human adenovirus, where it binds at the base of peripentonal hexons 
in a pH-dependent manner. Our findings suggest a possible role for pVIn in 
targeting pVI to hexons for proper assembly of the virion and timely release of 
the membrane lytic mature VI molecule.
