Integrin α1β1 binding to collagen IV, which is mediated by the α1-inserted (I) 
domain, down-regulates collagen synthesis. When unligated, a salt bridge between 
Arg(287) and Glu(317) is thought to keep this domain in a low affinity 
conformation. Ligand binding opens the salt bridge leading to a high-affinity 
conformation. How modulating integrin α1β1 affinity alters collagen homeostasis 
is unknown. To address this question, we utilized a thermolysin-derived product 
of the α1α2α1 network of collagen IV (α1α2α1(IV) truncated protomer) that 
selectively binds integrin α1β1. We show that an E317A substitution enhanced 
binding to the truncated protomer, consistent with a previous finding that this 
substitution eliminates the salt bridge. Surprisingly, we show that an R287A 
substitution did not alter binding, whereas R287E/E317R substitutions enhanced 
binding to the truncated protomer. NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling 
suggested that eliminating the Glu(317) negative charge is sufficient to induce 
a conformational change toward the open state. Thus, the role played by Glu(317) 
is largely independent of the salt bridge. We further show that cells expressing 
E317A or R287E/E317R substitutions have enhanced down-regulation of collagen IV 
synthesis, which is mediated by the ERK/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, we have 
demonstrated that modulating the affinity of the extracellular α1 I domain to 
collagen IV enhances outside-in signaling by potentiating ERK activation and 
enhancing the down-regulation of collagen synthesis.
