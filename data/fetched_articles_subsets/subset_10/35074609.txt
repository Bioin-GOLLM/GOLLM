OBJECTIVES: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common health problem, causing 
considerable morbidity and mortality. The incidence of VTE is higher in pregnant 
women than in those who are not pregnant. However, genetic factors for VTE in 
pregnant women are largely unknown.
METHODS: We performed a large-scale prospective cohort study of 65,138 
pregnancies. 24 pregnant patients diagnosed with VTE and 24 matched pregnant 
women without VTE were enrolled and sequenced by whole exome sequencing. We 
investigated the occurrence of known VTE risk variants, damaging variants found 
in thrombophilia genes and rare damaging variants possibly related to VTE in 
pregnancies. An exome-wide association study was also performed using a 
case-control design.
RESULTS: Our findings suggest that VTE in pregnancies may be mainly related to 
(i) the presence of known pathogenic variants in affected individual like F2, 
(ii) possibly damaging variants found in major thrombophilia gene GCKR, and 
(iii) 1 pathogenic and 13 likely pathogenic rare damaging variants associated 
with genetic errors. In exome-wide association stage, 42 variants at 34 genes 
may show suggestive associations with VTE in pregnancies (the lowest 
P = 3.5 × 10-7). ZFP41 (rs6558339, P = 8.85 × 10-5) in 24 patients were the only 
exonic missense variant.
CONCLUSION: The combined findings suggest that some genes may be involved in the 
mechanism of basement membranes, sterol accumulation and atherosclerosis, lipid 
metabolism and coagulation deficiency. These identified risk variants may 
improve the understanding of VTE pathogenesis in pregnancies and provide 
potential biomarker for development of clinical diagnosis.
