Endobiotic fungi are considered as a reservoir of numerous active metabolites. 
Asparaginase is used as an antileukemic drug specially to treat acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia. The presented study aims to optimize the media 
conditions, purify, characterize, and test the antileukemic activity of the 
asparaginase induced from Lasiodiplodia theobromae. The culture medium was 
optimized using an experiment designed by The Taguchi model with an activity 
ranging from 10 to 175 IU/mL. Asparaginase was induced with an activity of 315 
IU/mL. Asparaginase was purified with a specific activity of 468.03 U/mg and 
total activity of 84.4 IU/mL. The purified asparaginase showed an approximate 
size of 70 kDa. The purified asparaginase showed an optimum temperature of 37 °C 
and an optimum pH of 6. SDS reduced the activity of asparaginase to 0.65 U/mL 
while the used ionic surfactants enhanced the enzyme activity up to 151.92 
IU/mL. The purified asparaginase showed a Km of 9.37 µM and Vmax of 127.00 
µM/mL/min. The purified asparaginase showed an IC50 of 35.2 ± 0.7 IU/mL with 
leukemic M-NFS-60 cell lines and CC50 of 79.4 ± 1.9 IU/mL with the normal WI-38 
cell line. The presented study suggests the use of endophytic fungi as a 
sustainable source for metabolites such as asparaginase, provides an opportunity 
to develop a facile, eco-friendly, cost-effective, and rapid synthesis of 
antileukemic drugs, which have the potential to be used as alternative and 
reliable sources for potent anticancer agents.
