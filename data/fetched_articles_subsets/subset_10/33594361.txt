Coronaviruses have caused several epidemics and pandemics including the ongoing 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Some prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic 
antibodies have already showed striking effectiveness against COVID-19. 
Nevertheless, concerns remain about antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 as well as 
threats from other sarbecoviruses. Cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-related 
viruses provide opportunities to address such concerns. Here, we report on 
crystal structures of a cross-neutralizing antibody CV38-142 in complex with the 
receptor binding domains from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our structural findings 
provide mechanistic insights into how this antibody can accommodate antigenic 
variation in these viruses. CV38-142 synergizes with other cross-neutralizing 
antibodies, in particular COVA1-16, to enhance neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and 
SARS-CoV. Overall, this study provides valuable information for vaccine and 
therapeutic design to address current and future antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 
and to protect against zoonotic coronaviruses.
