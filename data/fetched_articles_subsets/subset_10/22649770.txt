RASSF1A is one of the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressors yet 
identified in human cancer. It is pro-apoptotic and appears to function as a 
scaffolding protein that interacts with a variety of other tumor suppressors to 
modulate their function. It can also complex with the Ras oncoprotein and may 
serve to integrate pro-growth and pro-death signaling pathways. A SNP has been 
identified that is present in approximately 29% of European populations 
[rs2073498, A(133)S]. Several studies have now presented evidence that this SNP 
is associated with an enhanced risk of developing breast cancer. We have used a 
proteomics based approach to identify multiple differences in the pattern of 
protein/protein interactions mediated by the wild type compared to the SNP 
variant protein. We have also identified a significant difference in biological 
activity between wild type and SNP variant protein. However, we have found only 
a very modest association of the SNP with breast cancer predisposition.
