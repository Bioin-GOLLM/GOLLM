Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) detoxifies or bioactivates many low 
molecular-weight compounds. Most knowledge about CYP2E1 activity relies on 
studies of the enzyme localized to endoplasmic reticulum (erCYP2E1); however, 
CYP2E1 undergoes transport to mitochondria (mtCYP2E1) and becomes metabolically 
active. We report the first comparison of in vitro steady-state kinetic profiles 
for erCYP2E1 and mtCYP2E1 oxidation of probe substrate 4-nitrophenol and 
pollutants styrene and aniline using subcellular fractions from rat liver. For 
all substrates, metabolic efficiency changed with substrate concentration for 
erCYP2E1 reflected in non-hyperbolic kinetic profiles but not for mtCYP2E1. 
Hyperbolic kinetic profiles for the mitochondrial enzyme were consistent with 
Michaelis-Menten mechanism in which metabolic efficiency was constant. By 
contrast, erCYP2E1 metabolism of 4-nitrophenol led to a loss of enzyme 
efficiency at high substrate concentrations when substrate inhibited the 
reaction. Similarly, aniline metabolism by erCYP2E1 demonstrated negative 
cooperativity as metabolic efficiency decreased with increasing substrate 
concentration. The opposite was observed for erCYP2E1 oxidation of styrene; the 
sigmoidal kinetic profile indicated increased efficiency at higher substrate 
concentrations. These mechanisms and CYP2E1 levels in mitochondria and 
endoplasmic reticulum were used to estimate the impact of CYP2E1 subcellular 
localization on metabolic flux of pollutants. Those models showed that erCYP2E1 
mainly carries out aniline metabolism at all aniline concentrations. Conversely, 
mtCYP2E1 dominates styrene oxidation at low styrene concentrations and erCYP2E1 
at higher concentrations. Taken together, subcellular localization of CYP2E1 
results in distinctly different enzyme activities that could impact overall 
metabolic clearance and/or activation of substrates and thus impact the 
interpretation and prediction of toxicological outcomes.
