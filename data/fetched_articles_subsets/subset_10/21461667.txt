This study examined a possible association between the mutations related to 
Factor V Leiden and Factor II (prothrombin) and stroke in Saudi neonates. A 
multiplex PCR was established to detect Factor V Leiden G1691A and prothrombin 
G20210A mutations in 72 neonatal stroke subjects and 70 healthy adult controls 
with no family history of thromboembolic diseases. The frequency of the 
homozygous normal genotype (GG) of both genes was found to be significantly 
lower in the stroke subjects than in the controls (P < 0.0001). The stroke cases 
also had higher frequencies of the combined Factor II heterozygous mutant form 
(GA) and the homozygous normal Factor V (GG) (P < 0.0001) and of the combined 
heterozygous Factor V and the homozygous normal Factor II genotypes (GG) (P = 
0.0) than controls. The study concluded that prothrombin and Factor V Leiden may 
be important risk factors for neonatal stroke in Saudi children.
