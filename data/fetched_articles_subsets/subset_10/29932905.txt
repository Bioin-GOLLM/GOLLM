Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) maintains gene silencing by catalyzing 
methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me2/3) within chromatin. By 
designing a system whereby PRC2-mediated repressive domains were collapsed and 
then reconstructed in an inducible fashion in vivo, a two-step mechanism of 
H3K27me2/3 domain formation became evident. First, PRC2 is stably recruited by 
the actions of JARID2 and MTF2 to a limited number of spatially interacting 
"nucleation sites," creating H3K27me3-forming Polycomb foci within the nucleus. 
Second, PRC2 is allosterically activated via its binding to H3K27me3 and rapidly 
spreads H3K27me2/3 both in cis and in far-cis via long-range contacts. As PRC2 
proceeds further from the nucleation sites, its stability on chromatin decreases 
such that domains of H3K27me3 remain proximal, and those of H3K27me2 distal, to 
the nucleation sites. This study demonstrates the principles of de novo 
establishment of PRC2-mediated repressive domains across the genome.
