LIMD1 is a tumour suppressor gene (TSG) down regulated in ∼80% of lung cancers 
with loss also demonstrated in breast and head and neck squamous cell 
carcinomas. LIMD1 is also a candidate TSG in childhood acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia. Mechanistically, LIMD1 interacts with pRB, repressing E2F-driven 
transcription as well as being a critical component of microRNA-mediated gene 
silencing. In this study we show a CpG island within the LIMD1 promoter contains 
a conserved binding motif for the transcription factor PU.1. Mutation of the 
PU.1 consensus reduced promoter driven transcription by 90%. ChIP and EMSA 
analysis demonstrated that PU.1 specifically binds to the LIMD1 promoter. siRNA 
depletion of PU.1 significantly reduced endogenous LIMD1 expression, 
demonstrating that PU.1 is a major transcriptional activator of LIMD1.
