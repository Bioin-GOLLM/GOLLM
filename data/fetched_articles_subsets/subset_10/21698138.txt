Vertebrate genes often play functionally distinct roles in different subsets of 
cells; however, tools to study the cell-specific function of gene products are 
poorly developed. Therefore, we have established a novel mouse model that 
enables the visualization and manipulation of defined subpopulations of neurons. 
To demonstrate the power of our system, we dissected genetic cascades in which 
Pax6 is central to control tangentially migrating neurons of the mouse 
brainstem. Several Pax6 downstream genes were identified and their function was 
analyzed by over-expression and knock-down experiments. One of these, Pou4f2, 
induces a prolonged midline arrest of growth cones to influence the proportion 
of ipsilaterally versus contralaterally settling neurons. These results 
demonstrate that our approach serves as a versatile tool to study the function 
of genes involved in cell migration, axonal pathfinding, and patterning 
processes. Our model will also serve as a general tool to specifically 
over-express any gene in a defined subpopulation of neurons and should easily be 
adapted to a wide range of applications.
