OBJECTIVE: Severe drinking can cause serious morbidity and death. Because the 
serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is an important regulator of neuronal 5-HT 
function, allelic differences at that gene may modulate the severity of alcohol 
consumption and predict therapeutic response to the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, 
ondansetron.
METHOD: The authors randomized 283 alcoholics by genotype in the 5'-regulatory 
region of the 5-HTT gene (LL/LS/SS), with additional genotyping for another 
functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (T/G), rs1042173, in the 
3'-untranslated region, in a double-blind controlled trial. Participants 
received either ondansetron (4 Î¼g/kg twice daily) or placebo for 11 weeks, plus 
standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy.
RESULTS: Individuals with the LL genotype who received ondansetron had a lower 
mean number of drinks per drinking day (-1.62) and a higher percentage of days 
abstinent (11.27%) than those who received placebo. Among ondansetron 
recipients, the number of drinks per drinking day was lower (-1.53) and the 
percentage of days abstinent higher (9.73%) in LL compared with LS/SS 
individuals. LL individuals in the ondansetron group also had a lower number of 
drinks per drinking day (-1.45) and a higher percentage of days abstinent 
(9.65%) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined. For both number 
of drinks per drinking day and percentage of days abstinent, 5'-HTTLPR and 
rs1042173 variants interacted significantly. LL/TT individuals in the 
ondansetron group had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-2.63) and a 
higher percentage of days abstinent (16.99%) than all other genotype and 
treatment groups combined.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose a new pharmacogenetic approach using 
ondansetron to treat severe drinking and improve abstinence in alcoholics.
