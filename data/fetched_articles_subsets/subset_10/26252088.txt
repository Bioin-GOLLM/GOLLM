OBJECTIVE: To identify potential mutation of TRAPPC2 gene in a Chinese family 
affected with X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (X-SEDL), and explore 
its underlying molecular mechanism.
METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 32 members of the family 
and 50 healthy adults to extract genomic DNA. DNA sequences of exons 3 to 6 and 
their exon/intron boundaries were amplified with PCR amplification. Direct 
bi-directional sequencing analysis was performed on the PCR products. The 
sequences were aligned to the reference sequences from the GenBank to determine 
mutation site and type.
RESULTS: A nucleotide substitution of the splice-donor in TRAPPC2 intron 3, 
c.93+5G>A, was detected in the proband, but no sequence change was detected in 
TRAPPC2 exons 3 to 6. All of the 6 male patients and 8 female carriers from the 
family were detected to have carried this mutation. The same mutation was not 
found in the remaining 18 family members with a normal phenotype and 50 healthy 
controls.
CONCLUSION: We have detected a c.93+5G>A mutation in the TRAPPC2 gene in a 
Chinese family affected with X-SEDL. Our results have expanded the spectrum of 
TRAPPC2 mutations and is helpful for presymptomatic and prenatal diagnoses of 
this disease.
