The association between the glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) Ile105Val 
polymorphism and gynecological cancer susceptibility has been evaluated in many 
studies. However, the results remain controversial. Thus, this meta-analysis, 
based on 10 published case-control studies, was designed to clarify the 
association of the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism with gynecological cancer risk. 
Our results suggested that there was no significant association between the 
GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism and the risk of gynecological cancer in all genetic 
models (GG vs. AA: odds ratio [OR] = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
0.75-2.26; AG vs. AA: OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.74-1.73; AG/GG vs. AA: OR = 1.17, 
95% CI = 0.75-1.81; GG vs.
AA/AG: OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.79-2.42). Similarly, in the subgroup analyses by 
cancer type, ethnicity, and smoking status, no significant association with any 
genetic model was observed. In conclusion, the results of our meta-analysis 
suggest that the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism is not associated with the 
development of gynecological cancer.
