This study was performed to investigate the antioxidant activities of Nymphaea 
nouchali flower (NNF) extract and the underlying mechanism using RAW 264.7 
cells. The presence of gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, 
epicatechin gallate, caffeic acid, quercetin, and apigenin in the NNF was 
confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The extract had a 
very potent capacity to scavenge numerous free radicals. NNF extract was also 
able to prevent DNA damage and quench cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
generation induced by tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) with no signs of 
toxicity. The NNF extract was able to augment the expression of both primary and 
phase II detoxifying enzyme, resulting in combat the oxidative stress. This is 
accomplished by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) 
(p38 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) followed by 
enhancing the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 
factor 2 (Nrf2). This attenuates cellular ROS generation and confers protection 
from cell death. Altogether, the results of current study revealed that Nymphaea 
nouchali flower could be a source of natural phytochemicals that could lead to 
the development of new therapeutic agents for preventing oxidative stress 
associated diseases and attenuating disease progression.
