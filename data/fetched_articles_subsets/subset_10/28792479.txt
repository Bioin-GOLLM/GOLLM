Synthetic nucleic acid ligands (aptamers) have emerged as effective delivery 
tools for many therapeutic oligonucleotide-based drugs, including small 
interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In this review, we summarize recent progress in the 
aptamer selection technology that has made possible the identification of 
cell-specific, cell-internalizing aptamers for the cell-targeted delivery of 
therapeutic oligonucleotides. In addition, we review the original, 
proof-of-concept aptamer-siRNA delivery studies and discuss recent advances in 
aptamer-siRNA conjugate designs for applications ranging from cancer therapy to 
the development of targeted antivirals. Challenges and prospects of 
aptamer-targeted siRNA drugs for clinical development are further highlighted.
