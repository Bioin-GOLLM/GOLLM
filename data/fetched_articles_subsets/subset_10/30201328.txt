Systematic epistasis analyses in multifactorial disorders are an important step 
to better characterize complex genetic risk structures. We conducted a 
hypothesis-free sex-stratified genome-wide screening for epistasis contributing 
to Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility. We identified a statistical 
epistasis signal between the single nucleotide polymorphisms rs3733980 and 
rs7175766 that was associated with AD in males (genome-wide significant 
pBonferroni-corrected=0.0165). This signal pointed toward the genes WW and C2 
domain containing 1, aka KIBRA; 5q34 and TLN2 (talin 2; 15q22.2). Gene-based 
meta-analysis in 3 independent consortium data sets confirmed the identified 
interaction: the most significant (pmeta-Bonferroni-corrected=9.02*10-3) was for 
the single nucleotide polymorphism pair rs1477307 and rs4077746. In functional 
studies, WW and C2 domain containing 1, aka KIBRA and TLN2 coexpressed in the 
temporal cortex brain tissue of AD subjects (β=0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.30, 
p=0.01); modulated Tau toxicity in Drosophila eye experiments; colocalized in 
brain tissue cells, N2a neuroblastoma, and HeLa cell lines; and 
coimmunoprecipitated both in brain tissue and HEK293 cells. Our finding points 
toward new AD-related pathways and provides clues toward novel medical targets 
for the cure of AD.
