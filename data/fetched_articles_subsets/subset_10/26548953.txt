Diverse repertoires of antigen-receptor genes that result from combinatorial 
splicing of coding segments by V(D)J recombination are hallmarks of vertebrate 
immunity. The (RAG1-RAG2)2 recombinase (RAG) recognizes recombination signal 
sequences (RSSs) containing a heptamer, a spacer of 12 or 23 base pairs, and a 
nonamer (12-RSS or 23-RSS) and introduces precise breaks at RSS-coding segment 
junctions. RAG forms synaptic complexes only with one 12-RSS and one 23-RSS, a 
dogma known as the 12/23 rule that governs the recombination fidelity. We report 
cryo-electron microscopy structures of synaptic RAG complexes at up to 3.4 Å 
resolution, which reveal a closed conformation with base flipping and 
base-specific recognition of RSSs. Distortion at RSS-coding segment junctions 
and base flipping in coding segments uncover the two-metal-ion catalytic 
mechanism. Induced asymmetry involving tilting of the nonamer-binding domain 
dimer of RAG1 upon binding of HMGB1-bent 12-RSS or 23-RSS underlies the 
molecular mechanism for the 12/23 rule.
