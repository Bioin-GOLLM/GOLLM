Atrial septal defect is one of the most common CHD. The pathogenesis of atrial 
septal defect still remains unknown. Cx43 is the most prevalent connexin in the 
mammalian heart during development. Its genetic variants can cause several CHD. 
The aim of our study was to investigate the association of genetic variations of 
the Cx43 with sporadic atrial septal defect. A total of 450 paediatric patients 
were recruited, including 150 cases with atrial septal defect and 300 healthy 
controls. The promoter region of Cx43 was analysed by sequencing after 
polymerase chain reaction. All data were analysed by using the Statistic Package 
for Social Science 19.0 software. The frequency of the single nucleotide 
polymorphism rs2071166 was significantly higher in atrial septal defect cases 
than in healthy controls. The CC genotype at rs2071166 site in Cx43 was 
correlated with an increased risk for atrial septal defect (p<0.0001, odds 
ratio=3.891, 95% confidence interval 1.948-7.772) and the C allele was 
positively correlated with atrial septal defect (p=0.007, odds ratio=1.567, 95% 
confidence interval 1.129-2.175). In conclusion, our results confirmed that 
rs2071166 in Cx43 may be relevant with an increased atrial septal defect risk.
