MTHFR Gene Mutations: A Potential Marker of Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease?

Rom√°n GC.

Recent epigenome-wide association studies have confirmed the importance of 
epigenetic effects mediated by DNA methylation in late-onset Alzheimer's disease 
(LOAD). Metabolic folate pathways and methyl donor reactions facilitated by 
B-group vitamins may be critical in the pathogenesis of LOAD. 
Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations were studied in 
consecutive Alzheimer's Disease & Memory Clinic patients up to December 2014. 
DNA analyses of MTHFR-C667T and - A1298C homozygous and heterozygous 
polymorphisms in 93 consecutive elderly patients revealed high prevalence of 
MTHFR mutations (92.5%). Findings require confirmation in a larger series, but 
MTHFR mutations may become a LOAD marker, opening novel possibilities for 
prevention and treatment.
