Neuroblastoma is a malignancy arising from the developing sympathetic nervous 
system and the most common and deadly cancer of infancy. New therapies are 
needed to improve the prognosis for high-risk patients and to reduce toxicity 
and late effects. Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has previously been identified as 
a promising drug target in various inflammatory diseases and cancers but has so 
far not been extensively studied as a potential therapeutic target in 
neuroblastoma. In this study, we observed elevated SYK gene expression in 
neuroblastoma compared to neural crest and benign neurofibroma. While SYK 
protein was detected in the majority of examined neuroblastoma tissues it was 
less frequently observed in neuroblastoma cell lines. Depletion of SYK by siRNA 
and the use of small molecule SYK inhibitors significantly reduced the cell 
viability of neuroblastoma cell lines expressing SYK protein. Moreover, SYK 
inhibition decreased ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. The SYK inhibitor BAY 
613606 enhanced the effect of different chemotherapeutic drugs. Transient 
expression of a constitutive active SYK variant increased the viability of 
neuroblastoma cells independent of endogenous SYK levels. Collectively, our 
findings suggest that targeting SYK in combination with conventional 
chemotherapy should be further evaluated as a treatment option in neuroblastoma.
