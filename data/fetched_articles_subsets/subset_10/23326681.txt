Myelinating glia, oligodendrocytes in central nervous system and Schwann cells 
in peripheral nervous system, form myelin sheath, a multilayered membrane system 
around axons enabling salutatory nerve impulse conduction and maintaining axonal 
integrity. Myelin sheath is a polarized structure localized in the axonal side 
and therefore is supposed to be formed based on the preceding polarization of 
myelinating glia. Thus, myelination process is closely associated with 
polarization of myelinating glia. However, cell polarization has been less 
extensively studied in myelinating glia than other cell types such as epithelial 
cells. The ultimate goal of this paper is to provide insights for the field of 
myelination research by applying the information obtained in polarity study in 
other cell types, especially epithelial cells, to cell polarization of 
myelinating glia. Thus, in this paper, the main aspects of cell polarization 
study in general are summarized. Then, they will be compared with polarization 
in oligodendrocytes. Finally, the achievements obtained in polarization study 
for epithelial cells, oligodendrocytes, and other types of cells will be 
translated into polarization/myelination process by Schwann cells. Then, based 
on this model, the perspectives in the study of Schwann cell 
polarization/myelination will be discussed.
