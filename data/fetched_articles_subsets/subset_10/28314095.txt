Eukaryotic protein kinases typically phosphorylate substrates in the context of 
specific sequence motifs, contributing to specificity essential for accurate 
signal transmission. Protein kinases recognize their target sequences through 
complementary interactions within the active site cleft. As a step toward the 
construction of orthogonal kinase signaling systems, we have re-engineered the 
protein kinase Pim1 to alter its phosphorylation consensus sequence. Residues in 
the Pim1 catalytic domain interacting directly with a critical arginine residue 
in the substrate were substituted to produce a kinase mutant that instead 
accommodates a hydrophobic residue. We then introduced a compensating mutation 
into a Pim1 substrate, the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, to reconstitute 
phosphorylation both in vitro and in living cells. Coexpression of the 
redesigned kinase with its substrate in cells protected them from apoptosis. 
Such orthogonal kinase-substrate pairs provide tools to probe the functional 
consequences of specific phosphorylation events in living cells and to design 
synthetic signaling pathways.
