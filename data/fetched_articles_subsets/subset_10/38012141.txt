Mitochondria have been identified to be involved in oxidative phosphorylation, 
lipid metabolism, cell death, and cell proliferation. Previous studies have 
demonstrated that mitoguardin (Miga), a mitochondrial protein that governs 
mitochondrial fusion, mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contacts, lipid 
formation, and autophagy, is crucial for ovarian endocrine and follicular 
development. Nevertheless, whether mammalian MIGA1 or MIGA2 (MIGA1,-2) regulates 
ovarian granulosa cell proliferation remains unclear. This study revealed that 
mammalian MIGA1,-2 promotes cell proliferation and regulates the phosphorylation 
and localization of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in ovarian granulosa cells. 
MIGA2 upregulation resulted in reduced YAP1 activity, while MIGA2 removal led to 
increased YAP1 activity. Further analysis indicated that MIGA1,-2 regulated YAP1 
via the Hippo signaling pathway and regulated protein kinase B (AKT) activity in 
collaboration with YAP1. In addition, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) regulated 
MIGA2 expression and AKT activity by activating YAP1. Briefly, we demonstrated 
that the mitochondrial MIGA1 and MIGA2, especially MIGA2, promoted cellular 
proliferation by activating AKT and regulating the Hippo/YAP1 signaling pathway 
in ovarian granulosa cells, which may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis 
of reproductive endocrine diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
