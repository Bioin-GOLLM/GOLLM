OBJECTIVE: Mutations of the selenoprotein N gene (SEPN1) cause SEPN1-related 
myopathy (SEPN1-RM), a novel early-onset muscle disorder formerly divided into 
four different nosological categories. Selenoprotein N (SelN) is the only 
selenoprotein involved in a genetic disease; its function being unknown, no 
treatment is available for this potentially lethal disorder. Our objective was 
to clarify the role of SelN and the pathophysiology of SEPN1-RM to identify 
therapeutic targets.
METHODS: We established and analyzed an ex vivo model of SelN deficiency using 
fibroblast and myoblast primary cultures from patients with null SEPN1 
mutations. DCFH assay, OxyBlot, Western blot, Fura-2, and cell survival studies 
were performed to measure intracellular oxidant activity, oxidative stress 
markers, calcium handling, and response to exogenous treatments.
RESULTS: SelN-depleted cells showed oxidative/nitrosative stress manifested by 
increased intracellular oxidant activity (reactive oxygen species and nitric 
oxide) and/or excessive oxidation of proteins, including the contractile 
proteins actin and myosin heavy chain II in myotubes. SelN-devoid myotubes 
showed also Ca(2+) homeostasis abnormalities suggesting dysfunction of the 
redox-sensor Ca(2+) channel ryanodine receptor type 1. Furthermore, absence of 
SelN was associated with abnormal susceptibility to H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative 
stress, demonstrated by increased cell death. This cell phenotype was restored 
by pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine.
INTERPRETATION: SelN plays a key role in redox homeostasis and human cell 
protection against oxidative stress. Oxidative/nitrosative stress is a primary 
pathogenic mechanism in SEPN1-RM, which can be effectively targeted ex vivo by 
antioxidants. These findings pave the way to SEPN1-RM treatment, which would 
represent a first specific pharmacological treatment for a congenital myopathy.
