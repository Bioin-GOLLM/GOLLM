PURPOSES: The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between 
endoplasmic reticulum amino peptidase 1 (ERAP1) gene polymorphisms and 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in Han population of Shaanxi province.
METHODS: 100 AS patients and 100 healthy people were enrolled in present study 
as case and control groups respectively, and the control group was matched with 
the case group by age and gender. ERAP1 gene rs27434 and rs7711564 polymorphisms 
were test by TaqMan probe genotyping method. SHEsis software was used to operate 
linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis between the two single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Ï‡(2) test was employed to compare the 
differences of the genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies between the case 
and control groups. Relative risk of AS was represented by odds ratios (ORs) and 
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
RESULTS: In ERAP1 rs27434 and rs7711564 polymorphisms, the frequencies of AA and 
CC genotypes in case group were significantly higher compared to those in 
control group (P=0.036; P=0.039), and so were the frequencies of A and C alleles 
(OR=1.589, 95% CI=1.070-2.359, P=0.028; OR=1.535, 95% CI=1.021-2.308, P=0.050). 
Linkage disequilibrium test and haplotype analysis of the alleles of the two 
SNPs showed that the frequency of A-C haplotype was higher in case group than 
that in control group (P=0.005), which indicated that A-C might be the 
susceptible haplotype to AS.
CONCLUSIONS: ERAP1 gene rs27434 and rs7711564 polymorphisms may increase the 
risk of AS.
