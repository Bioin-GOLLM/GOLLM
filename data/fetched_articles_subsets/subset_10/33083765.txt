A major hurdle in the treatment of cancer is chemoresistance induced under 
hypoxia that is characteristic of tumor microenvironment. Triptolide, a potent 
inhibitor of eukaryotic transcription, possesses potent antitumor activity. 
However, its clinical potential has been limited by toxicity and water 
solubility. To address those limitations of triptolide, we designed and 
synthesized glucose-triptolide conjugates (glutriptolides) and demonstrated 
their antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we identified a lead, 
glutriptolide-2 with an altered linker structure. Glutriptolide-2 possessed 
improved stability in human serum, greater selectivity toward cancer over normal 
cells, and increased potency against cancer cells. Glutriptolide-2 exhibits 
sustained antitumor activity, prolonging survival in a prostate cancer 
metastasis animal model. Importantly, we found that glutriptolide-2 was more 
potent against cancer cells under hypoxia than normoxia. Together, this work 
provides an attractive glutriptolide drug lead and suggests a viable strategy to 
overcome chemoresistance through conjugation of cytotoxic agents to glucose.
