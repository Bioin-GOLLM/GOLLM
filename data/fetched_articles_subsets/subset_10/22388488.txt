Biodegradable cationic micelles show promise for applications in gene delivery. 
In this article, we used DOTAP to modify monomethoxy poly(ethylene 
glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL, MP) micelles in one step, creating novel 
cationic self-assembled DOTAP and MPEG-PCL hybrid micelles (DMP). These micelles 
had a mean particle size of 46 ± 5.6 nm and a zeta potential of 41.8 ± 0.5 mV, 
and had the capacity to bind DNA. Compared with PEI25K (the gold standard), DMP 
micelles had higher transfection efficiency and lower cytotoxicity. Moreover, we 
used DMP to deliver the Survivin-T34A gene (S-T34A, a suicide gene) to treat 
colon cancer. DMP delivered the Survivin-T34A gene (DMP/S-T34A) and could induce 
apoptosis in cancer cells, resulting in inhibition of the growth of C-26 colon 
cancer cells in vitro. An in vivo study indicated that intraperitoneal 
administration of DMP micelles delivered the Survivin-T34A gene and efficiently 
inhibited the growth of abdominal metastatic C-26 colon cancer and the malignant 
ascites. These data suggest that DMP may be a novel gene carrier, and its 
delivery of the S-T34A gene may have promising applications in the treatment of 
colon cancer.
