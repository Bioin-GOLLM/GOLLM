PURPOSE: The expanding number of targeted therapeutics for non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) necessitates real-time tumor genotyping, yet tissue biopsies are 
difficult to perform serially and often yield inadequate DNA for next-generation 
sequencing (NGS). We evaluated the feasibility of using cell-free circulating 
tumor DNA (ctDNA) NGS as a complement or alternative to tissue NGS.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 112 plasma samples obtained from a consecutive 
study of 102 prospectively enrolled patients with advanced NSCLC were subjected 
to ultra-deep sequencing of up to 70 genes and matched with tissue samples, when 
possible.
RESULTS: We detected 275 alterations in 45 genes, and at least one alteration in 
the ctDNA for 86 of 102 patients (84%), with EGFR variants being most common. 
ctDNA NGS detected 50 driver and 12 resistance mutations, and mutations in 22 
additional genes for which experimental therapies, including clinical trials, 
are available. Although ctDNA NGS was completed for 102 consecutive patients, 
tissue sequencing was only successful for 50 patients (49%). Actionable EGFR 
mutations were detected in 24 tissue and 19 ctDNA samples, yielding concordance 
of 79%, with a shorter time interval between tissue and blood collection 
associated with increased concordance (P = 0.038). ctDNA sequencing identified 
eight patients harboring a resistance mutation who developed progressive disease 
while on targeted therapy, and for whom tissue sequencing was not possible.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutically targetable driver and resistance mutations can be 
detected by ctDNA NGS, even when tissue is unavailable, thus allowing more 
accurate diagnosis, improved patient management, and serial sampling to monitor 
disease progression and clonal evolution. Clin Cancer Res; 22(23); 5772-82.
