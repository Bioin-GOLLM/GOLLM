BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that the polymorphism M129V in 
the PRNP gene modifies the phenotype in all the subtypes of prion diseases in 
humans. All cases diagnosed to date as suffering the human variant of mad cow 
disease (vCJD) carry the allele 129M. In the last five years five cases of vCJD 
have been reported in Spain, three of them in Castilla y León (in western 
Spain). Observation of differences in the genotypic frequency of this 
polymorphism in different populations prompted us to analyze the distribution of 
genotypes of the V129M polymorphism in a population from Castilla y León to 
determine if there is an increased risk to develop vCJD in this region of Spain.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied the coding region of the PRNP gene containing 
codon 129 in 110 healthy individuals from Castilla y León. We amplified the DNA 
by PCR and allelic discrimination was performed after digestion with restriction 
enzyme NspI. Comparison between groups was performed by X(2) test.
RESULTS: Our results show a distribution of genotypes of the V129M polymorphism 
in the population from Castilla y León which is similar to other Spanish and 
European populations.
CONCLUSIONS: From the genetic point of view, the risk of people from Castilla y 
León to suffer vCJD should be similar to that of the other Spanish regions.
