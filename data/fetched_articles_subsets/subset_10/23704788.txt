Synthetic Biology is the 'Engineering of Biology' - it aims to use a 
forward-engineering design cycle based on specifications, modelling, analysis, 
experimental implementation, testing and validation to modify natural or design 
new, synthetic biology systems so that they behave in a predictable fashion. 
Motivated by the need for truly plug-and-play synthetic biological components, 
we present a comprehensive review of ways in which the various parts of a 
biological system can be modified systematically. In particular, we review the 
list of 'dials' that are available to the designer and discuss how they can be 
modelled, tuned and implemented. The dials are categorized according to whether 
they operate at the global, transcriptional, translational or post-translational 
level and the resolution that they operate at. We end this review with a 
discussion on the relative advantages and disadvantages of some dials over 
others.
