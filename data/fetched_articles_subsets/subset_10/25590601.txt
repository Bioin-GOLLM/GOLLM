The Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase that 
forms 2 distinct protein complexes referred to as TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and 2 
(TORC2). Recent extensive studies have demonstrated that TORC1 is under the 
control of the small GTPases Rheb and Rag that funnel multiple input signals 
including those derived from nutritional sources; however, information is scarce 
as to the regulation of TORC2. A previous study using the model system provided 
by the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe identified Ryh1, a Rab-family 
GTPase, as an activator of TORC2. Here, we show that the nucleotide-binding 
state of Ryh1 is regulated in response to glucose, mediating this major nutrient 
signal to TORC2. In glucose-rich growth media, the GTP-bound form of Ryh1 
induces TORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Gad8, a downstream target of TORC2 in 
fission yeast. Upon glucose deprivation, Ryh1 becomes inactive, which turns off 
the TORC2-Gad8 pathway. During glucose starvation, however, Gad8 phosphorylation 
by TORC2 gradually recovers independently of Ryh1, implying an additional TORC2 
activator that is regulated negatively by glucose. The paired positive and 
negative regulatory mechanisms may allow fine-tuning of the TORC2-Gad8 pathway, 
which is essential for growth under glucose-limited environment.
