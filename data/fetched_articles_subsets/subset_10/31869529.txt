OBJECTIVE: The TLR3/cGAS-STING-IFN signaling has recently been reported to be 
disturbed in colorectal cancer due to deregulated expression of the genes 
involved. Our study aimed to investigate the influence of potential regulatory 
variants in these genes on the risk of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) in a 
Czech cohort of 1424 CRC patients and 1114 healthy controls.
METHODS: The variants in the TLR3, CGAS, TMEM173, IKBKE, and TBK1 genes were 
selected using various online bioinformatic tools, such as UCSC browser, 
HaploReg, Regulome DB, Gtex Portal, SIFT, PolyPhen2, and miRNA prediction tools.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and sex detected a 
nominal association between CRC risk and three variants, CGAS rs72960018 (OR: 
1.68, 95% CI: 1.11-2.53, P-value = .01), CGAS rs9352000 (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 
1.07-3.84, P-value = .03) and TMEM173 rs13153461 (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.03-2.27, 
P-value = .03). Their cumulative effect revealed a threefold increased CRC risk 
in carriers of 5-6 risk alleles compared to those with 0-2 risk alleles. 
Epistatic interactions between these genes and the previously genotyped IFNAR1, 
IFNAR2, IFNA, IFNB, IFNK, IFNW, IRF3, and IRF7 genes, were computed to test 
their effect on CRC risk. Overall, we obtained nine pair-wise interactions 
within and between the CGAS, TMEM173, IKBKE, and TBK1 genes. Two of them 
remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. Additional 52 
interactions were observed when IFN variants were added to the analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that epistatic interactions and a high number of 
risk alleles may play an important role in CRC carcinogenesis, offering novel 
biological understanding for the CRC management.
