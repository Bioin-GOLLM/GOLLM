Having pets in the house during the first years of life has been shown to 
protect against allergies. However, the result of different studies is 
heterogeneous. The aim of this study was to evaluate the methylation pattern in 
cord blood in relation to pet ownership during pregnancy.We investigated the 
methylation patterns of 96 cord blood samples, participants of the Epigenetic 
Hallmark of Maternal Atopy and Diet-ELMA project, born to mothers who either 
owned pets (n = 32) or did not own pets (n = 64) during their pregnancy. DNA 
from cord blood was analysed using the Infinium methylation EPIC. For 
statistical analysis, RnBeads software was applied.We found 113 differentially 
methylated sites (DMs) in the covariate-adjusted analysis (FDR p < 0.05), with 
small methylation differences. The top DMs were associated with genes: UBA7, 
THRAP3, GTDC1, PDE8A and SBK2. In the regional analysis, two promoter regions 
presented with significance: RN7SL621P and RNU6-211P. Cis-regulatory element 
analysis revealed significant associations with several immune-related pathways, 
such as regulation of IL18, Toll signalling, IL6 and complement.We conclude that 
pet exposure during pregnancy causes subtle but significant changes in 
methylation patterns in cord blood, which are reflected in the biological 
processes governing both innate and adaptive immune responses.
