Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been associated with slower rates of 
cognitive decline. We investigated the association between omega-3 PUFAs and 
cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) receiving 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). This was a prospective cohort study 
using registered data. Patients with AD receiving AChEIs were recruited from 1 
May 2016 to 30 April 2019 and were followed up for two years. Their daily diet 
record and blood concentration of omega-3 PUFAs were analyzed. Multiple linear 
and binary logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with 
cognitive decline (continuous and dichotomized cognitive change). In the 
research, 129 patients with AD were identified with a mean age of 76.5 Â± 6.6. 
Patients with AD with lower baseline omega-3 PUFAs levels were associated with a 
higher risk of cognitive decline than those with higher levels (odds ratio [OR] 
= 1.067, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.012, 1.125; p = 0.016) after 
adjustment. Patients with AD with a lower baseline DHA (OR = 1.131, 95% CI: 
1.020, 1.254; p = 0.020), but not EPA, were associated with a higher risk of 
cognitive decline. We found that higher Mini-Nutritional Assessment scores (beta 
= -0.383, 95% CI = -0.182--0.048, p = 0.001) and total fat (beta = -0.248, 95% 
CI = -0.067--0.003, p = 0.031) were independently associated with slow cognitive 
decline in patients with AD receiving AChEIs. The baseline blood levels of 
omega-3 PUFAs were associated with cognitive decline in patients with AD 
receiving AChEIs. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify 
whether this association is causal.
