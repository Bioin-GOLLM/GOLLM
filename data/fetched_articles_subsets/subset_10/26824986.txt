Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), a rare malignancy with a poor prognosis, 
is mainly caused by exposure to asbestos or other organic fibers, but the 
underlying genetic mechanism is not fully understood. Genetic alterations and 
causes for multiple primary cancer development including MPM are unknown. We 
used whole exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in a patient with MPM 
and two additional primary cancers who had no evidence of venous, arterial, 
lymphovascular, or perineural invasion indicating dissemination of a primary 
lung cancer to the pleura. We found that the MPM had R282W, a key TP53 mutation, 
and genome-wide allelic loss or loss of heterozygosity, a distinct genomic 
alteration not previously described in MPM. We identified frequent inactivating 
SETDB1 mutations in this patient and in 68 additional MPM patients (mutation 
frequency: 10%, 7/69) by targeted deep sequencing. Our observations suggest the 
possibility of a new genetic mechanism in the development of either MPM or 
multiple primary cancers. The frequent SETDB1 inactivating mutations suggest 
there could be new diagnostic or therapeutic options for MPM.
