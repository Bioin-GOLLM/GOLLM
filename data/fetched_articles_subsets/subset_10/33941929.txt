Identification and quantification of low-frequency mutations remain challenging 
despite improvements in the baseline error rate of next-generation sequencing 
technologies. Here, we describe a method, termed SaferSeqS, that addresses these 
challenges by (1) efficiently introducing identical molecular barcodes in the 
Watson and Crick strands of template molecules and (2) enriching target 
sequences with strand-specific PCR. The method achieves high sensitivity and 
specificity and detects variants at frequencies below 1 in 100,000 DNA template 
molecules with a background mutation rate of <5 × 10-7 mutants per base pair 
(bp). We demonstrate that it can evaluate mutations in a single amplicon or 
simultaneously in multiple amplicons, assess limited quantities of cell-free DNA 
with high recovery of both strands and reduce the error rate of existing 
PCR-based molecular barcoding approaches by >100-fold.
