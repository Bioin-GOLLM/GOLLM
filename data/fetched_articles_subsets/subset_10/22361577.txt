AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: A new pathomechanism of Parkinson's disease (PD) involving 
regulation of mitochondrial functions was recently proposed. Parkin complexed 
with mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) binds mtDNA and promotes 
mitochondrial biogenesis, which is abolished by PARK2 gene mutations. We have 
previously shown that mitochondrial haplogroups/clusters and TFAM common 
variation influenced PD risk. We investigate the role of PARK2 polymorphisms on 
PD risk and their interactions with mitochondrial haplogroups/clusters as well 
as with TFAM variability.
METHODS: 104 early-onset PD patients (EOPD, age at onset ≤ 50 years) were 
screened for PARK2 coding sequence changes including gene dosage alterations. 
Three selected PARK2 polymorphisms (S167N, V380L, D394N) were genotyped in 326 
PD patients and 315 controls using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay.
RESULTS: PARK2 screen revealed two heterozygous changes in two EOPD patients: 
exon 2 deletion and one novel synonymous variation (c.999C > A, P333P). In 
association study no differences in genotype/allele frequencies of S167N, V380L, 
D394N were found between analyzed groups. Stratification by mitochondrial 
clusters revealed higher frequency of V380L G/G genotype and allele G in PD 
patients, within HV cluster (p = 0.040; p = 0.022, respectively). Moreover, 
interaction between genotypes G/G V380L of PARK2 and G/G rs2306604 of TFAM, 
within HV cluster was significant (OR 2.05; CI 1.04-4.04; p = 0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that co-occurrence of G/G V380L PARK2 and G/G 
rs2306604 TFAM on the prooxidative HV cluster background can contribute to PD 
risk. We confirm low PARK2 mutation frequency in Polish EOPD patients.
