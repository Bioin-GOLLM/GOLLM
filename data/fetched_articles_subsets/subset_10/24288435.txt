Internet use and video-game playing are experiencing rapid growth among both 
youth and adult populations. Research suggests that a minority of users 
experience symptoms traditionally associated with substance-related addictions. 
Mental health professionals, policy makers and the general public continue to 
debate the issue of Internet addiction (IA) and problematic video-game playing 
(PVG). This review identifies existing studies into the clinical and biological 
characteristics of these disorders that may help guide decisions as to whether 
or not IA and PVG should be grouped together with substance use disorders 
(SUDs).
