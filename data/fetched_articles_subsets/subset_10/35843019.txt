Skin fibroblasts obtained from a 20-year-old woman with clinically manifested 
and genetically proven (F508del/CFTRdele2.3) cystic fibrosis were successfully 
transformed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by using Sendai 
virus-based reprogramming vectors including the four Yamanaka factors, OCT3/4, 
SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC. The iPSCs showed a normal karyotype, expressed 
pluripotency markers and exhibited the potential to differentiate into three 
germ layers in spontaneous differentiation assay. This iPSC line may be used for 
development of a personalized treatment including genome editing, disease 
modelling, cell differentiation and organoid formation, pharmacological 
investigations and drug screening.
