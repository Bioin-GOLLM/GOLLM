Enlarged fontanelles and smaller frontal bones result in a mechanically 
compromised skull. Both phenotypes could develop from defective migration and 
differentiation of osteoblasts in the skull bone primordia. The Wnt/Planar cell 
polarity (Wnt/PCP) signaling pathway regulates cell migration and movement in 
other tissues and led us to test the role of Prickle1, a core component of the 
Wnt/PCP pathway, in the skull. For these studies, we used the missense allele of 
Prickle1 named Prickle1Beetlejuice (Prickle1Bj). The Prickle1Bj/Bj mutants are 
microcephalic and develop enlarged fontanelles between insufficient frontal 
bones, while the parietal bones are normal. Prickle1Bj/Bj mutants have several 
other craniofacial defects including a midline cleft lip, incompletely penetrant 
cleft palate, and decreased proximal-distal growth of the head. We observed 
decreased Wnt/Î²-catenin and Hedgehog signaling in the frontal bone condensations 
of the Prickle1Bj/Bj mutants. Surprisingly, the smaller frontal bones do not 
result from defects in cell proliferation or death, but rather significantly 
delayed differentiation and decreased expression of migratory markers in the 
frontal bone osteoblast precursors. Our data suggests that Prickle1 protein 
function contributes to both the migration and differentiation of osteoblast 
precursors in the frontal bone.
