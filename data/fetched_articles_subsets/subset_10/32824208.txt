Macrophages are the front soldiers of the innate immune system and are vital for 
immune defense, tumor surveillance, and tissue homeostasis. In chronic diseases, 
including cancer and liver fibrosis, macrophages can be forced into an 
immunosuppressive and profibrotic M2 phenotype. M2-type macrophages overexpress 
the mannose receptor CD206. Targeting these cells via CD206 and macrophage 
repolarization towards an immune stimulating and antifibrotic M1 phenotype 
through RNA interference represents an appealing therapeutic approach. We 
designed nanohydrogel particles equipped with mannose residues on the surface 
(ManNP) that delivered siRNA more efficiently to M2 polarized macrophages 
compared to their untargeted counterparts (NonNP) in vitro. The ManNP were then 
assessed for their in vivo targeting potential in mice with experimental liver 
fibrosis that is characterized by increased profibrotic (and immunosuppressive) 
M2-type macrophages. Double-labelled siRNA-loaded ManNP carrying two different 
near infrared labels for siRNA and ManNP showed good biocompatibility and robust 
uptake in fibrotic livers as assessed by in vivo near infrared imaging. 
siRNA-ManNP were highly colocalized with CD206+ M2-type macrophages on a 
cellular level, while untargeted NP (NonNP) showed little colocalization and 
were non-specifically taken up by other liver cells. ManNP did not induce 
hepatic inflammation or kidney dysfunction, as demonstrated by serological 
analysis. In conclusion, α-mannosyl-functionalized ManNP direct NP towards 
M2-type macrophages in diseased livers and prevent unspecific uptake in 
non-target cells. ManNP are promising vehicles for siRNA and other drugs for 
immunomodulatory treatment of liver fibrosis and liver cancer.
