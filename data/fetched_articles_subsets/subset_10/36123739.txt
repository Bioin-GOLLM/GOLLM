BACKGROUND: Due to the detrimental effects of chemical preservatives, there has 
been an increasing demand for safer, healthier and natural bio-preservatives. 
Bacteriocins have attracted increasing interest because of their potential as 
natural bio-preservatives.
RESULTS: We screened a large number of Bacillus thuringiensis strains and 
isolated one strain (B. thuringiensis P86) with antimicrobial activity against 
several foodborne pathogens. Three novel leaderless bacteriocins, including 
thucin A1, thucin A2 and thucin A3, were purified and identified from the 
culture supernatant of B. thuringiensis P86, whose molecular masses were 
5552.02, 5578.07 and 5609.06 Da, respectively. Thucin A1 was then selected as a 
representative to be tested, and it exhibited potent inhibitory activity against 
all tested gram-positive bacteria. More importantly, thucin A1 showed stronger 
antimicrobial activity than nisin A against two important foodborne pathogens 
Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. In addition, thucin A1 exhibited 
strong acid-base adaptability (pH 2-11), high endurance to heat, good stability 
to trypsin and pepsin, no hemolysis activity and cytotoxicity, and could 
effectively inhibit or eliminate Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes in 
skim milk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that these novel leaderless bacteriocins are 
potentially promising food biopreservatives.
