The type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is localized to specific subcellular 
environments through the binding of the regulatory subunit (RII) dimer to 
RII-anchoring proteins. Computer-aided analysis of secondary structure, 
performed on four RII-anchoring protein sequences (the microtubule-associated 
protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins Ht 21 and Ht 31), has identified 
common regions of approximately 14 residues which display high probabilities of 
forming amphipathic helices. The potential amphipathic helix region of Ht 31 
(Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ala-Val-Ile) lies between residues 
494 and 507. A bacterially expressed 318-amino acid fragment, Ht 31 (418-736), 
containing the amphipathic helix region, was able to bind RII alpha. 
Site-directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt the secondary structure in the 
putative binding helix reduced binding dramatically. Specifically, substitution 
of proline for Ala-498 significantly diminished RII alpha binding, and similar 
mutation of Ile-502 or Ile-507 abolished interaction. Mutation of Ala-522 to 
proline, which is located outside the predicted amphipathic helix region, had no 
effect on RII alpha binding. These data suggest that anchoring proteins interact 
with RII alpha via an amphipathic helix binding motif.
