It was reported that DNA repair can confer cancer cell resistance to therapeutic 
treatments by activating antiapoptotic cellular defense. We hypothesized that 
genetic variants of DNA repair genes may be associated with lung cancer 
prognosis. Seventeen tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (tagSNPs) selected 
from 12 DNA repair genes were genotyped in 280 advanced non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) patients by TaqMan assay. The associations of these SNPs and 
overall survival of advanced NSCLC patients were investigated. Advanced NSCLC 
patients carrying ERCC2 rs50872 CT+TT genotypes had significantly longer median 
survival time (MST) and decreased death risk than patients with rs50872 CC 
genotype [log-rank P = 0.031; adjusted HR(95% CI) = 0.73 (0.55-0.98), 
P = 0.033]. These effects were mainly seen among younger patients (≤65 years 
old) [HR(95% CI) = 0.57 (0.37-0.87), P = 0.010], patients without surgery 
[HR(95% CI) = 0.68 (0.47-0.98), P = 0.036] but with chemotherapy [HR(95% 
CI) = 0.64 (0.46-0.91), P = 0.012] or radiotherapy [HR(95% CI) = 0.58 
(0.38-0.89), P = 0.013]. Meanwhile, compared to advanced NSCLC patients with 
rs25487 GG genotype, patients carrying XRCC1 rs25487 GA+AA genotypes had 
significantly shorter MST (MST = 11.7 vs. 16.7, log-rank P = 0.048). In 
addition, advanced NSCLC patients carrying the ERCC2 rs50872 CC in combination 
with XRCC1 rs25487 GA+AA genotype had the shortest MST (11.2 month) and highest 
death risk [HR(95% CI) = 1.70 (1.15-2.52), P = 0.008] when compared with those 
carrying rs50872 CT+TT and rs25487 GG genotype (MST = 22.0 month). The ERCC2 
rs50872 T allele was associated with favorable but XRCC1 rs25487 A allele with 
bad survival for advanced NSCLC in Chinese population, which may offer novel 
biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes.
