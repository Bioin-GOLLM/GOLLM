Nuclear DNA wraps around core histones to form nucleosomes, which restricts the 
binding of transcription factors to gene regulatory sequences. Pioneer 
transcription factors can bind DNA sites on nucleosomes and initiate gene 
regulatory events, often leading to the local opening of chromatin. However, the 
nucleosomal configuration of open chromatin and the basis for its regulation is 
unclear. We combined low and high levels of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) 
digestion along with core histone mapping to assess the nucleosomal 
configuration at enhancers and promoters in mouse liver. We find that 
MNase-accessible nucleosomes, bound by transcription factors, are retained more 
at liver-specific enhancers than at promoters and ubiquitous enhancers. The 
pioneer factor FoxA displaces linker histone H1, thereby keeping enhancer 
nucleosomes accessible in chromatin and allowing other liver-specific 
transcription factors to bind and stimulate transcription. Thus, nucleosomes are 
not exclusively repressive to gene regulation when they are retained with, and 
exposed by, pioneer factors.
