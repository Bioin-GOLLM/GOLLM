Transcriptome profiling can broadly characterize drug effects and risk for 
addiction in the absence of drug exposure. Modern large-scale molecular methods, 
including RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), have been extensively applied to 
alcohol-related disease traits, but rarely to risk for methamphetamine (MA) 
addiction. We used RNA-Seq data from selectively bred mice with high or low risk 
for voluntary MA intake to construct coexpression and cosplicing networks for 
differential risk. Three brain reward circuitry regions were explored, the 
nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and ventral midbrain (VMB). 
With respect to differential gene expression and wiring, the VMB was more 
strongly affected than either the PFC or NAc. Coexpression network connectivity 
was higher in the low MA drinking line than in the high MA drinking line in the 
VMB, oppositely affected in the NAc, and little impacted in the PFC. Gene 
modules protected from the effects of selection may help to eliminate certain 
mechanisms from significant involvement in risk for MA intake. One such module 
was enriched in genes with dopamine-associated annotations. Overall, the data 
suggest that mitochondrial function and glutamate-mediated synaptic plasticity 
have key roles in the outcomes of selective breeding for high versus low levels 
of MA intake.
