Mammals have two insulin-like growth factors (IGF) that are key mediators of 
somatic growth, tissue differentiation, and cellular responses to stress. Thus, 
the mechanisms that regulate the bioavailability of IGFs are important in both 
normal and aberrant development. IGF-I levels are primarily controlled via the 
growth hormone-IGF axis, in response to nutritional status, and also reflect 
metabolic diseases and cancer. One mechanism that controls IGF bioavailablity is 
the binding of circulating IGF to a number of binding proteins that keep IGF in 
a stable, but receptor non-binding state. However, even before IGF is released 
from the cells that produce it, it undergoes an obligatory association with a 
ubiquitous chaperone protein, GRP94. This binding is required for secretion of a 
properly folded, mature IGF. This chapter reviews the known aspects of the 
interaction and highlights the specificity issues yet to be determined. The 
IGF-GRP94 interaction provides a potential novel mechanism of idiopathic short 
stature, involving the obligatory chaperone and not just IGF gene expression. It 
also provides a novel target for cancer treatment, as GRP94 activity can be 
either inhibited or enhanced.
