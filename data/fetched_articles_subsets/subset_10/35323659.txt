A variety of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) phenotypes are 
tightly linked to changes in the cardiac energy metabolism that can lead to a 
loss of metabolic flexibility and to unfavorable clinical outcomes. We conducted 
an association analysis of 31 ASCVD phenotypes and 97 whole blood amino acids, 
acylcarnitines and derived ratios in the LIFE-Adult (n = 9646) and LIFE-Heart (n 
= 5860) studies, respectively. In addition to hundreds of significant 
associations, a total of 62 associations of six phenotypes were found in both 
studies. Positive associations of various amino acids and a range of 
acylcarnitines with decreasing cardiovascular health indicate disruptions in 
mitochondrial, as well as peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. We complemented our 
metabolite association analyses with whole blood and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene-expression analyses of fatty acid oxidation and 
ketone-body metabolism related genes. This revealed several differential 
expressions for the heart failure biomarker N-terminal prohormone of brain 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene 
expression. Finally, we constructed and compared three prediction models of 
significant stenosis in the LIFE-Heart study using (1) traditional risk factors 
only, (2) the metabolite panel only and (3) a combined model. Area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) comparison of these three models 
shows an improved prediction accuracy for the combined metabolite and classical 
risk factor model (AUC = 0.78, 95%-CI: 0.76-0.80). In conclusion, we improved 
our understanding of metabolic implications of ASCVD phenotypes by observing 
associations with metabolite concentrations and gene expression of the 
mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, we 
demonstrated the predictive potential of the metabolite profile to improve 
classification of patients with significant stenosis.
