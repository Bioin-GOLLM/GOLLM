Although insulitis is the characteristic main feature of type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (T1DM), many aspects of β cell loss still remain elusive. Immune 
dysregulation and alterations in the dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-incretin system 
might have a role in disease development, but their connection is poorly 
understood. We assessed the associations of a few selected, immunologically 
relevant single nucleotide gene variants with the DPP-4-incretin system in 
individuals with T1DM and in healthy controls. Prandial plasma (total, active) 
GLP-1 levels, serum DPP-4 activity, CD25 and CTLA-4 expression of T cells and 
DPP4 rs6741949, CTLA4 rs3087243, CD25 rs61839660 and PTPN2 rs2476601 SNPs were 
assessed in 33 T1DM patients and 34 age-, gender-, BMI-matched non-diabetic 
controls without a family history of T1DM. CTLA-4 expression was lower in the 
Foxp3+CD25+ regulatory T cells from individuals homozygous for the CTLA4 
rs3087243-G variant compared to those who carry an A allele. Prandial plasma 
total GLP-1 levels 45 min after a standardized meal were reduced in individuals 
homozygous for the CTLA4 rs3087243 G major allele compared to A allele carriers 
both in the entire study population (with statistical power over 90%) and within 
the T1DM group. Here we report for the first time a reduced total prandial GLP-1 
plasma concentration in individuals with the CTLA4 rs3087243 G/G genotype. One 
may speculate that immune response-related L cell damage might possibly explain 
this novel association.
