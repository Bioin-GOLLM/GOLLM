Extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve as trafficking vehicles and intercellular 
communication tools. Their cargo molecules directly reflect characteristics of 
their parental cell. This includes information on cell identity and specific 
cellular conditions, ranging from normal to pathological states. In cancer, the 
content of EVs derived from tumor cells is altered and can induce oncogenic 
reprogramming of target cells. As a result, tumor-derived EVs compromise 
antitumor immunity and promote cancer progression and spreading. However, this 
pro-oncogenic phenotype is constantly being challenged by EVs derived from the 
local tumor microenvironment and from remote sources. Here, we summarize the 
role of EVs in the tumor-immune cross-talk that includes, but is not limited to, 
immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. We discuss the potential of remotely 
released EVs from the microbiome and during physical activity to shape the 
tumor-immune cross-talk, directly or indirectly, and confer antitumor activity. 
We further discuss the role of proinflammatory EVs in the temporal development 
of the tumor-immune interactions and their potential use for cancer diagnostics.
