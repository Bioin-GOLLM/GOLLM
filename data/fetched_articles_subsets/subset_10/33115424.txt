BACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has been shown to result in 
rapid reductions in both suicidal ideation (SI) and depressive symptoms in 
clinical trials. There is a practical need for identification of pre-treatment 
predictors of ketamine response. Previous studies indicate links between 
treatment response and body mass index (BMI), depression symptoms and previous 
suicide attempts. Our aim was to explore the use of clinical and demographic 
factors to predict response to serial doses of oral ketamine for chronic 
suicidal ideation.
METHODS: Thirty-two participants completed the Oral Ketamine Trial on 
Suicidality (OKTOS). Data for the current study were drawn from pre-treatment 
and follow-up time-points of OKTOS. Only clinical and sociodemographic variables 
were included in this analysis. Data were used to create a proof of concept 
Bayesian network (BN) model of variables predicting prolonged response to oral 
ketamine, as defined by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS).
RESULTS: The network of potential predictors of response was evaluated using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. A combination of nine 
demographic and clinical variables predicted prolonged ketamine response, with 
strong contributions from BMI, Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment 
Scale (SOFAS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), number of 
suicide attempts, employment status and age. We evaluated and optimised the 
proposed network to increase the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The performance 
evaluation demonstrated that the BN predicted prolonged ketamine response with 
97% accuracy, and AUC = 0.87.
CONCLUSIONS: At present, validated tools to facilitate risk assessment are 
infrequently used in psychiatric practice. Pre-treatment assessment of 
individuals' likelihood of response to oral ketamine for chronic suicidal 
ideation could be beneficial in making more informed decisions about likelihood 
of success for this treatment course. Clinical trials registration number
