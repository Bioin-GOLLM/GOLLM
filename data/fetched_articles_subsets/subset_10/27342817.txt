The use of mouse genetic tools to track and manipulate fibroblasts has provided 
invaluable in vivo information regarding the activities of these cells. 
Recently, many new mouse strains have been described for the specific purpose of 
studying fibroblast behavior. Colorimetric reporter mice and lines expressing 
Cre are available for the study of fibroblasts in the organs prone to fibrosis, 
including heart, kidney, liver, lung, and skeletal muscle. In this review we 
summarize the current state of the models that have been used to define tissue 
resident fibroblast populations. While these complex genetic reagents provide 
unique insights into the process of fibrosis, they also require a thorough 
understanding of the caveats and limitations. Here, we discuss the specificity 
and efficiency of the available genetic models and briefly describe how they 
have been used to document the mechanisms of fibrosis.
