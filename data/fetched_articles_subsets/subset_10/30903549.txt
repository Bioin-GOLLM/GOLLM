Apolipoprotein (APOE) e4 genotype is an accepted risk factor for accelerated 
cognitive aging and dementia, though its neurostructural substrates are unclear. 
The deleterious effects of this genotype on brain structure may increase in 
magnitude into older age. This study aimed to investigate in UK Biobank the 
association between APOE e4 allele presence vs. absence and brain imaging 
variables that have been associated with worse cognitive abilities; and whether 
this association varies by cross-sectional age. We used brain magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and genetic data from a general-population cohort: the UK Biobank 
(N = 8395 after exclusions). We adjusted for the covariates of age in years, 
sex, Townsend social deprivation scores, smoking history and cardiometabolic 
diseases. There was a statistically significant association between APOE e4 
genotype and increased (i.e. worse) white matter (WM) hyperintensity volumes 
(standardised beta = 0.088, 95% confidence intervals = 0.036 to 0.139, 
P = 0.001), a marker of poorer cerebrovascular health. There were no 
associations with left or right hippocampal, total grey matter (GM) or WM 
volumes, or WM tract integrity indexed by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean 
diffusivity (MD). There were no statistically significant interactions with age. 
Future research in UK Biobank utilising intermediate phenotypes and longitudinal 
imaging hold significant promise for this area, particularly pertaining to APOE 
e4's potential link with cerebrovascular contributions to cognitive aging.
