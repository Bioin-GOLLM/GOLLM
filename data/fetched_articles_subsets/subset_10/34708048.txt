Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of transcripts with fundamental roles 
in the carcinogenesis. DSCAM Antisense RNA 1 (DSCAM-AS1) is an example of this 
group of transcripts which has been firstly identified in an attempt to find 
differentially expressed transcripts between breast tumor cells and benign 
breast samples. The pathogenic roles of DSCAM-AS1 have been vastly assessed in 
breast cancer, yet its roles are not restricted to this type of cancer. 
Independent studies in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, 
osteosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma and cervical cancer have 
validated participation of DSCAM-AS1 in the carcinogenic processes. miR-577, 
miR-122-5p, miR-204-5p, miR-136, miR-137, miR-382, miR-183, miR-99, miR-3173-5p, 
miR-874-3p, miR-874-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-2467-3p, miR-216b, miR-384, miR-186-5p, 
miR-338-3p, miR-877-5p and miR-101 are among miRNAs which interact with 
DSCAM-AS1. Moreover, this lncRNA has interactions with Wnt/β-catenin pathway. 
The current study aims at summarization of the results of studies which focused 
on the assessment of oncogenic role of DSCAM-AS1.
