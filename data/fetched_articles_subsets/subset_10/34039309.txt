BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
remains a major public health problem and its pathogenesis remains unresolved. A 
recent proteomics study discovered a lipid enzyme Sterol O-acyltransferase 
(SOAT1) involvement in the progression of HCC. We aimed to explore the 
association between SOAT1 genetic variation and HCC.
METHODS: We genotyped three exonic SOAT1 variants (rs10753191, V323V; rs3753526, 
L475L; rs13306731, Q526R) tagging most variations in the gene, in 221 HCC 
patients and 229 healthy individuals, to assess the impact of SOAT1 gene 
variation on risk of HCC occurrence. We further conducted immunohistochemistry 
to compare SOAT1 protein expression levels in 42 paired tumor and adjacent 
non-tumor tissues.
RESULTS: We found that rs10753191 (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.58, P = 0.04) and a 
haplotype TGA (OR = 0.40, P = 0.01) were associated with reduced HCC risk after 
adjusting for lipid levels. In the immunohistochemistry experiment, we found 
that the protein expression of SOAT1 was significantly increased in the tumor 
compared with adjacent tissue (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed for the first time SOAT1 genetic variation that 
associates with host susceptibility to HCC occurrence. Our results suggest a 
role of SOAT1 in the HCC development, which warrants further elucidation.
