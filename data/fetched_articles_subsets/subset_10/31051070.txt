Fungal highly reducing polyketide synthases (HRPKSs) biosynthesize polyketides 
using a single set of domains iteratively. Product release is a critical step in 
HRPKS function to ensure timely termination and enzyme turnover. Nearly all of 
the HRPKSs characterized to date employ a separate thioesterase (TE) or 
acyltransferase enzyme for product release. In this study, we characterized two 
fungal HRPKSs that have fused C-terminal TE domains, a new domain architecture 
for fungal HRPKSs. We showed that both HRPKS-TEs synthesize aminoacylated 
polyketides in an ATP-independent fashion. The KU42 TE domain selects cysteine 
and homocysteine and catalyzes transthioesterification using the side-chain 
thiol group as the nucleophile. In contrast, the KU43 TE domain selects leucine 
methyl ester and performs a direct amidation of the polyketide, a reaction 
typically catalyzed by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains. The 
characterization of these HRPKS-TE enzymes showcases the functional diversity of 
HRPKS enzymes and provides potential TE domains as biocatalytic tools to 
diversify HRPKS structures.
