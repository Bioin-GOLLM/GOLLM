OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic β-cell mass and function are critical in glucose 
homeostasis. Their regulatory mechanisms have been studied principally under 
experimental conditions of reduced β-cell numbers, such as β-cell ablation and 
partial pancreatectomy. In the present study, we generated an opposite mouse 
model with an excessive amount of ectopic β-cells, and analyzed its consequence 
on β-cell mass and survival.
METHODS: Mice underwent sub-renal transplantation (SRT) of pseudo-islets 
generated from a pancreatic β-cell line MIN6 or intra-pancreatic transplantation 
(IPT) of MIN6 cells, and morphological and functional changes of their endocrine 
pancreata were analyzed. Cellular fate of pancreatic β-cells after 
transplantation was traced using RipCre:Rosa26-tdTomato mice. By using MIN6 
cells, we evaluated the roles of extracellular glucose, membrane potential, and 
insulin signaling on β-cell survival.
RESULTS: SRT mice developed severe, progressive hypoglycemia associated with 
marked reduction in insulin-positive (Ins+) cell mass and apparent increase in 
apoptotic Ins+ cells. In in vitro experiments of MIN6 cells, insulin signaling 
blockade potently induced cell death, suggesting that local insulin action is 
required for β-cell survival. In fact, IPT (i.e. transplantation close to 
endogenous β-cells) resulted in fewer apoptotic Ins+ cells compared with those 
induced by SRT. On the other hand, β-cell mass was decreased in proportion to 
the decrease in blood glucose levels in both SRT and IPT mice, suggesting a 
contribution of hypoglycemia induced by systemic hyperinsulinemia.
CONCLUSION: Insulin plays distinct roles in β-cell survival and β-cell mass 
regulation through its local and systemic actions on β-cells, respectively.
