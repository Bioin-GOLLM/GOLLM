AIM: There is evidence that interaction between angiotensin II type 1 receptor 
A1166C gene polymorphism and angiotensin I-converting enzyme Insertion/Deletion 
gene variation might have an effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. The 
study was carried out in a population of 2244 male Caucasians, whose coronary 
anatomy was defined by means of coronary angiography. We analysed the 
relationship, on the risk of ischaemic heart disease, of angiotensin II type 1 
receptor A1166C gene variation, not only to myocardial infarction but also to 
coronary artery disease, and its potential interaction with angiotensin 
I-converting enzyme Insertion/Deletion gene polymorphism.
METHODS AND RESULTS: No association was detected between angiotensin II type 1 
receptor A1166C gene polymorphism and coronary artery disease. Similarly, there 
was no link to myocardial infarction, either in the total population or in low 
risk groups. In addition, most importantly, we found no interaction between 
angiotensin II type 1 receptor A1166C gene variation and angiotensin 
I-converting Insertion/Deletion polymorphism, either in connection with the risk 
of coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSION: This angiotensin II type 1 receptor A1166C gene variation is not 
associated with any detectable increase in risk of ischaemic heart disease. The 
findings of the present study do not suggest that, as regards risk of coronary 
artery disease and myocardial infarction, there is interaction between gene 
polymorphism and angiotensin I-converting enzyme Insertion/Deletion gene 
variation.
