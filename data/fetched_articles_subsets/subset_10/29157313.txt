OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize CAPN5 gene expression in the mouse 
central nervous system. Mouse brain and eye sections were probed with two 
high-affinity RNA oligonucleotide analogs designed to bind CAPN5 RNA and one 
scramble, control oligonucleotide. Images were captured in brightfield.
RESULTS: CAPN5 RNA probes were validated on mouse breast cancer tumor tissue. In 
the eye, CAPN5 was expressed in the ganglion cell, inner nuclear and outer 
nuclear layers of the retina. Signal could not be detected in the ciliary body 
or the iris because of the high density of melanin. In the brain, CAPN5 was 
expressed in the granule cell layers of the hippocampus and cerebellum. There 
was scattered expression in pons. The visual cortex showed faint signal. Most 
signal in the brain was in a punctate pattern.
