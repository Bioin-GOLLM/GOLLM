Telaprevir (TVR) is an orally available protease inhibitor of the hepatitis C 
virus that in association with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR) was shown 
to improve the rates of sustained virological response and potentially reduce 
treatment duration in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype. Despite 
its robust activity in both treatment-naïve and experienced patients, the 
addition of TVR to PR is counterbalanced by increased costs and adverse events; 
moreover, there are still areas of uncertainty that regard treatment of patients 
with advanced liver disease, the role of patient stratification by genetic 
predictors, and the use/need for a lead-in phase with PR. Since TVR regimens 
have been associated with the risk of viral mutants that may cause treatment 
failure and jeopardize future therapeutic strategies with direct-acting 
antiviral agents, early stopping rules have been designed to protect patients 
with a poor virological response to TVR regimens against such a risk.
