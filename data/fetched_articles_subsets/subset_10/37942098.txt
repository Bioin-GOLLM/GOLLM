Hallux valgus is one of the most common forefoot deformities faced by foot and 
ankle surgeons. Symptomatic deformity usually needs surgical correction. 
Endoscopic techniques of hallux valgus correction have been reported that are 
based on the same principle of the classic distal soft tissue procedure. 
Recently, the technique has been modified to include reconstruction of the 
medial metatarsosesamoid ligament and augmentation of the intermetatarsal 
ligament. In severe deformity or the presence of hypermobility or painful 
degeneration of the first tarsometatarsal joint, Lapidus arthrodesis of the 
joint is indicated. Arthroscopic Lapidus arthrodesis has been reported to reduce 
the complications associated with open procedure, including first metatarsal 
shortening, metatarsal elevatus, and nonunion. In this technical note, the 
technical details of a combined modified endoscopic distal soft tissue procedure 
and arthroscopic Lapidus arthrodesis is described. This is a minimally invasive 
approach for correction of severe hallux valgus deformity, especially that 
associated with ligamentous laxity.
