Spiders of the genus Clubiona Latreille, 1804 from Xishuangbanna, Yunnan 
Province, China are studied. A total of 47 species is reported and illustrated, 
including 14 new species and two new synonyms. Twelve of the new species belong 
to four species groups: C. dengpao Yu & Li, sp. nov., C. subdidentata Yu & Li, 
sp. nov., C. tixing Yu & Li, sp. nov., C. xiaoci Yu & Li, sp. nov., C. xiaokong 
Yu & Li, sp. nov., C. yejiei Yu & Li, sp. nov., C. zhaoi Yu & Li, sp. nov. and 
C. zhigangi Yu & Li, sp. nov. from the C. corticalis group; C. mii Yu & Li, sp. 
nov. and C. subtongi Yu & Li, sp. nov. from the C. ternatensis group; C. banna 
Yu & Li, sp. nov. from the C. filicata group; and C. menglun Yu & Li, sp. nov. 
from the C. trivialis group. The remaining two new species, C. shuangsi Yu & Li, 
sp. nov. and C. wangchengi Yu & Li, sp. nov., are not readily assignable to any 
of the existing species groups. The female of C. cochlearis Yu & Li, 2019, the 
female of C. tiane Yu & Li, 2019, the female of C. bicornis Yu & Li, 2019, the 
male of C. lala Jäger & Dankittipakul, 2010 and the true female of C. suthepica 
Dankittipakul, 2008 are described for the first time. Two new synonyms are: C. 
vukomi Jäger & Dankittipakul, 2010 syn. nov. = C. circulata Zhang & Yin, 1998; 
C. melanothele Thorell, 1895 syn. nov. = Clubiona melanosticta Thorell, 1890. A 
checklist of Clubiona species from Xishuangbanna is provided. The DNA barcodes 
of almost all of the species were obtained for species delimitation, matching of 
sexes and future use.
