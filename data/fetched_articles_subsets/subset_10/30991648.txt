Protein SUMOylation is a dynamic post-translational modification which is 
involved in a diverse set of physiologic processes throughout the cell. Of note, 
SUMOylation also plays a role in the pathobiology of a myriad of cancers, one of 
which is glioblastoma (GBM). Accordingly, herein, we review core aspects of 
SUMOylation as it relates to GBM and in so doing highlight putative 
methods/modalities capable of therapeutically engaging the pathway for treatment 
of this deadly neoplasm.
