Rhabdomyolysis is one of the main causes of community-acquired acute kidney 
injury (AKI). Although inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of 
rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI (RIAKI), little is known about the mechanism that 
triggers inflammation during RIAKI. Recent evidence has indicated that sterile 
inflammation triggered by tissue injury can be mediated through multiprotein 
complexes called the inflammasomes. Therefore, we investigated the role of NLRP3 
inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of RIAKI using a glycerol-induced murine 
rhabdomyolysis model. Inflammasome-related molecules were upregulated in the 
kidney of RIAKI. Renal tubular injury and dysfunction preceded leukocyte 
infiltration into the kidney during the early phase of RIAKI, and they were 
markedly attenuated in mice deficient in NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and interleukin 
(IL)-1Î² compared with those in wild-type mice. No difference in leukocyte 
infiltration was observed between wild-type and NLRP3-deficient mice. 
Furthermore, NLRP3 deficiency strikingly suppressed the expression of renal 
injury markers and inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of renal tubular cells. 
These results demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasomes contribute to inflammation, 
apoptosis, and tissue injury during the early phase of RIAKI and provide new 
insights into the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of RIAKI.
