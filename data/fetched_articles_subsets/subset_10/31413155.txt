Phosphoinositides (PIPs) are a ubiquitous group of seven low-abundance 
phospholipids that play a crucial role in defining localized membrane properties 
and that regulate myriad cellular processes, including cytoskeletal remodeling, 
cell signaling cascades, ion channel activity and membrane traffic. PIP 
homeostasis is tightly regulated by numerous inositol kinases and phosphatases, 
which phosphorylate and dephosphorylate distinct PIP species. The importance of 
these phospholipids, and of the enzymes that regulate them, is increasingly 
being recognized, with the identification of human neurological disorders that 
are caused by mutations in PIP-modulating enzymes. Genetic disorders of PIP 
metabolism include forms of epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, brain 
malformation syndromes, peripheral neuropathy and congenital myopathy. In this 
Review, we provide an overview of PIP function and regulation, delineate the 
disorders associated with mutations in genes that modulate or utilize PIPs, and 
discuss what is understood about gene function and disease pathogenesis as 
established through animal models of these diseases.
