OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether epistasis between single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) within ACVR2B (activin A receptor, type IIB) and ADAMTS19 
(ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 19) genes is associated 
with premature ovarian failure (POF).
METHODS: One hundred twenty women with POF and 152 controls were recruited for 
stage I, and 1,641 additional female controls participated in stage II. 
GoldenGate assay with VeraCode technology was used for genotyping ACVR2B and 
ADAMTS19 SNPs in stage I. In stage II, we obtained genotype data for SNPs using 
Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 and imputed data using IMPUTE program 
from the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study.
RESULTS: In stage I, five combinations showed significant synergistic 
interactions after Bonferroni correction. One SNP (rs1468077 within 5' flanking 
region) and two intronic SNPs (rs2268753 and rs2268757) in ACVR2B and three 
intronic SNPs within ADAMTS19 (rs13158524, rs1476083, and rs1972624) were 
involved in synergistic interactions in a recessive manner. In stage II and 
combined analyses, we could not find any significant interactions between the 
SNPs. However, diplotypes within ACVR2B and ADAMTS19 that consist of risk 
genotypes or alleles in the results of significant synergistic interactions 
between SNPs showed significant interactions after Bonferroni correction. 
Thirteen and nine significant synergistic interactions were found in a dominant 
model in stage II and combined analyses, respectively (strongest association in 
combined analysis: odds ratio, 5.93; 95% CI, 2.47-14.20; P = 6.65 Ã— 10(-5)).
CONCLUSIONS: Epistasis between polymorphisms within ACVR2B and ADAMTS19 is 
significantly associated with susceptibility to POF.
