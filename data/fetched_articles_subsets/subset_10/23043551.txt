Epigenetic regulation is involved in numerous physiological and pathogenic 
processes. Among the key regulators that orchestrate epigenetic signaling are 
over 50 human protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs). Interrogation of the 
functions of individual PKMTs can be facilitated by target-specific PKMT 
inhibitors. Given the emerging need for such small molecules, we envisioned an 
approach to identify target-specific methyltransferase inhibitors by screening 
privileged small-molecule scaffolds against diverse methyltransferases. In this 
work, we demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach by identifying the 
inhibitors of SETD2. N-propyl sinefungin (Pr-SNF) was shown to interact 
preferentially with SETD2 by matching the distinct transition-state features of 
SETD2's catalytically active conformer. With Pr-SNF as a structure probe, we 
further revealed the dual roles of SETD2's post-SET loop in regulating substrate 
access through a distinct topological reconfiguration. Privileged sinefungin 
scaffolds are expected to have broad use as structure and chemical probes of 
methyltransferases.
