We report aqueous, site-selective modification of proteins using a reactive 
peptide interface comprising a nine-residue sequence. This interface is the 
fastest (second-order rate constant of 152 M-1 s-1) catalyst-free, 
cysteine-based method for modifying proteins available to date, and enables 
near-quantitative labeling of antibodies in cell lysate.
