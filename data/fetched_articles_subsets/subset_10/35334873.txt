Cystic fibrosis has historically been characterized by malnutrition, and 
nutrition strategies have placed emphasis on weight gain due to its association 
with better pulmonary outcomes. As treatment for this disease has significantly 
improved, longevity has increased and overweight and obesity have emerged issues 
in this population. The effect of excess weight and adiposity on CF clinical 
outcomes is unknown but may produce similar health consequences and 
obesity-related diseases as those observed in the general population. This 
review examines the prevalence of overweight and obesity in CF, the medical and 
psychological impact, as well as the existing evidence for treatment in the 
general population and how this may be applied to people with CF. Clinicians 
should partner with individuals with CF and their families to provide a 
personalized, interdisciplinary approach that includes dietary modification, 
physical activity, and behavioral intervention. Additional research is needed to 
identify the optimal strategies for preventing and addressing overweight and 
obesity in CF.
