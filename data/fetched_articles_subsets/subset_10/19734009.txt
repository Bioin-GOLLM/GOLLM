BACKGROUND: Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) or Dravet syndrome (DS) 
is a distinctive epilepsy syndrome often associated with de novo mutations in 
the SCN1A gene. However, 25-30% patients with SMEI/DS are negative for SCN1A 
mutation screening, suggesting that other molecular mechanisms may account for 
these disorders. Given the overlapping and heterogeneous clinical features of 
CDKL5- and ARX-related epilepsies and SMEI/DS, we postulated that CDKL5 
mutations in females and ARX mutations gene in males may be associated with 
early onset seizures forms of SMEI/DS.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with early onset SMEI/DS before 6 months negative 
for SCN1A mutational screening were selected and screened for mutations in the 
ARX gene in males (n=14) or the CDKL5 gene in females (n=14).
RESULTS: No mutations in either gene were found except one intronic variation of 
uncertain pathogenicity in the CDKL5 gene. All patients started seizures at mean 
age of 3.48 months. Thirteen patients had familial history of epilepsy or 
febrile seizures. Patients evolved toward refractory epilepsy with generalized 
tonic clonic seizures (18/28) and myoclonia (23/28) and severe neurological 
impairment with autistic features (13/28), ataxia (14/28) and spasticity (5/28). 
No patient ever exhibited infantile spasms, dystonia, or Rett-like features.
INTERPRETATIONS: Our results illustrate that mutation screening of ARX and CDKL5 
is not effective in patients selected on the basis of clinical signs associated 
to early onset SMEI/DS. In addition, they might reflect that other phenotypic 
features associated with CDKL5 mutations (Rett-like features, infantile spasm) 
or ARX mutations (dystonia, spasticity) are more distinctive.
