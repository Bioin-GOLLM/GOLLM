Persistent non-infectious uveitis has a significant morbidity, but the extent to 
which this is accompanied by inflammation driven remodelling of the tissue is 
unclear. To address this question, we studied a series of samples selected from 
two ocular tissue repositories and identified 15 samples with focal 
infiltration. Eleven of fifteen contained lymphocytes, both B cells (CD20 
positive) and T cells (CD3 positive). In 20% of the samples there was evidence 
of ectopic lymphoid like structures with focal aggregations of B cells and T 
cells, segregated into anatomically different adjacent zones. To investigate 
inflammation in the tissue, an analysis of 520 immune relevant transcripts was 
carried out and 24 genes were differentially upregulated, compared with control 
tissue. Two of these (CD14 and fibronectin) were increased in ocular 
inflammation compared to control immune tissue (tonsil). We demonstrate that in 
a significant minority of patients, chronic persistent uveitis leads to 
dysregulation of ocular immune surveillance, characterized by the development of 
areas of local ectopic lymphoid like structures, which may be a target for 
therapeutic intervention directed at antibody producing cells.
