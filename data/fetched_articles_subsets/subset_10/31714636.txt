OBJECTIVE: To examine whether genetic variation affecting the expression or 
function of lipid-lowering drug targets is associated with Alzheimer disease 
(AD) risk, to evaluate the potential impact of long-term exposure to 
corresponding therapeutics.
METHODS: We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses using variants in genes 
that encode the protein targets of several approved lipid-lowering drug classes: 
HMGCR (encoding the target for statins), PCSK9 (encoding the target for PCSK9 
inhibitors, eg, evolocumab and alirocumab), NPC1L1 (encoding the target for 
ezetimibe), and APOB (encoding the target of mipomersen). Variants were weighted 
by associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using data from 
lipid genetics consortia (n up to 295,826). We meta-analyzed Mendelian 
randomization estimates for regional variants weighted by LDL-C on AD risk from 
2 large samples (total n = 24,718 cases, 56,685 controls).
RESULTS: Models for HMGCR, APOB, and NPC1L1 did not suggest that the use of 
related lipid-lowering drug classes would affect AD risk. In contrast, 
genetically instrumented exposure to PCSK9 inhibitors was predicted to increase 
AD risk in both of the AD samples (combined odds ratio per standard deviation 
lower LDL-C inducible by the drug target = 1.45, 95% confidence interval = 
1.23-1.69). This risk increase was opposite to, although more modest than, the 
degree of protection from coronary artery disease predicted by these same 
methods for PCSK9 inhibition.
INTERPRETATION: We did not identify genetic support for the repurposing of 
statins, ezetimibe, or mipomersen for AD prevention. Notwithstanding caveats to 
this genetic evidence, pharmacovigilance for AD risk among users of PCSK9 
inhibitors may be warranted. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:30-39.
