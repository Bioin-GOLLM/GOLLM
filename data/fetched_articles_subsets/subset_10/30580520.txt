Bacteriorhodopsin represents the simplest, and possibly most abundant, 
phototropic system requiring only a retinal-bound transmembrane protein to 
convert photons of light to an energy-generating proton gradient. The creation 
and interrogation of a microbial rhodopsin mimic, based on an orthogonal protein 
system, would illuminate the design elements required to generate new 
photoactive proteins with novel function. We describe a microbial rhodopsin 
mimic, created using a small soluble protein as a template, that specifically 
photoisomerizes all- trans to 13- cis retinal followed by thermal relaxation to 
the all- trans isomer, mimicking the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle, in a single 
crystal. The key element for selective isomerization is a tuned steric 
interaction between the chromophore and protein, similar to that seen in the 
microbial rhodopsins. It is further demonstrated that a single mutation converts 
the system to a protein photoswitch without chromophore photoisomerization or 
conformational change.
