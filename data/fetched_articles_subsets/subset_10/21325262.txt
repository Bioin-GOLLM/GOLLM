We describe a case of heparin binding site Arg79Cys mutation in the gene 
encoding antithrombin, SERPINC1, in a Korean patient with hereditary 
antithrombin (AT) deficiency. The patient was a 34-year-old Korean man who 
presented with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right leg without precipitating 
factors. On outpatient evaluation, coagulation tests without anticoagulation 
revealed a decreased AT III activity level at 48%, but normal AT III antigen 
level at 103%, indicating type II AT deficiency. Family studies revealed that 
his father (62 years of age) had decreased AT activity (48%) but had normal AT 
antigen levels (116%), indicating that the proband had a paternally inherited 
type II AT deficiency. Direct sequencing of the SERPINC1 gene in the patient and 
his father revealed a heterozygotic missense mutation, a cytosine to thymine 
substitution at nucleotide position 235 in exon 2 of the SERPINC1 gene 
(p.Arg79Cys). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Arg79Cys 
heterozygote mutation in family members with venous thromboembolism.
