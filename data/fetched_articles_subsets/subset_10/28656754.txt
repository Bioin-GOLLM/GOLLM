P34 probable thiol protease (P34) and Gly m Bd 30K (30K) show high relationship 
with the protease of 24 kDa oleosin of soybean oil bodies. In this study, 9 day 
germinated soybean was used to separate bioprocessed P34 (P32) from bioprocessed 
30K (28K). Interestingly, P32 existed as dimer, whereas 28K existed as monomer; 
a P32-rich sample had proteolytic activity and high cleavage site specificity 
(Lys-Thr of 24 kDa oleosin), whereas a 28K-rich sample showed low proteolytic 
activity; the P32-rich sample contained one thiol protease. After mixing with 
purified oil bodies, all P32 dimers were dissociated and bound to 24 kDa 
oleosins to form P32-24 kDa oleosin complexes. By incubation, 24 kDa oleosin was 
preferentially hydrolyzed, and two hydrolyzed products (HPs; 17 and 7 kDa) were 
confirmed. After most of 24 kDa oleosin was hydrolyzed, some P32 existed as 
dimer, and the other as P32-17 kDa HP. It was suggested that P32 was the 
protease.
