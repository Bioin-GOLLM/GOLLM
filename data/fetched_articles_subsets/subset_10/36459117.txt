One-third of newly synthesized proteins in mammals are translocated into the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Sec61 translocon. How protein 
translocation coordinates with chaperone availability in the ER to promote 
protein folding remains unclear. We find that marginally hydrophobic signal 
sequences and transmembrane domains cause transient retention at the Sec61 
translocon and require the luminal BiP chaperone for efficient protein 
translocation. Using a substrate-trapping proteomic approach, we identify that 
nascent proteins bearing marginally hydrophobic signal sequences accumulate on 
the cytosolic side of the Sec61 translocon. Sec63 is co-translationally 
recruited to the translocation site and mediates BiP binding to incoming 
polypeptides. BiP binding not only releases translocationally paused nascent 
chains but also ensures protein folding in the ER. Increasing hydrophobicity of 
signal sequences bypasses Sec63/BiP-dependent translocation, but translocated 
proteins are prone to misfold and aggregate in the ER under limited BiP 
availability. Thus, the signal sequence-guided protein folding may explain why 
signal sequences are diverse and use multiple protein translocation pathways.
