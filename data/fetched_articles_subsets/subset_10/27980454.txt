BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are related to different biological 
processes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the possible molecular 
mechanisms underlying the effects of the long noncoding RNA HOXA11-AS (HOXA11 
antisense RNA) in NSCLC are unknown.
METHODS: HOXA11-AS was knocked down in the NSCLC A549 cell line and a high 
throughput microarray assay was applied to detect changes in the gene profiles 
of the A549 cells. Bioinformatics analyses (gene ontology (GO), pathway, Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and network analyses) were performed 
to investigate the potential pathways and networks of the differentially 
expressed genes. The molecular signatures database (MSigDB) was used to display 
the expression profiles of these differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, 
the relationships between the HOXA11-AS, de-regulated genes and clinical NSCLC 
parameters were verified by using NSCLC patient information from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In addition, the relationship between HOXA11-AS 
expression and clinical diagnostic value was analyzed by receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: Among the differentially expressed genes, 277 and 80 genes were 
upregulated and downregulated in NSCLC, respectively (fold change ≥2.0, P < 0.05 
and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). According to the degree of the fold 
change, six upregulated and three downregulated genes were selected for further 
investigation. Only four genes (RSPO3, ADAMTS8, DMBT1, and DOCK8) were reported 
to be related with the development or progression of NSCLC based on a PubMed 
search. Among all possible pathways, three pathways (the PI3K-Akt, TGF-beta and 
Hippo signaling pathways) were the most likely to be involved in NSCLC 
development and progression. Furthermore, we found that HOXA11-AS was highly 
expressed in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma based on TCGA 
database. The ROC curve showed that the area under curve (AUC) of HOXA11-AS was 
0.727 (95% CI 0.663-0.790) for lung adenocarcinoma and 0.933 (95% CI 
0.906-0.960) for squamous cell carcinoma patients. Additionally, the original 
data from TCGA verified that ADAMTS8, DMBT1 and DOCK8 were downregulated in both 
lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, whereas RSPO3 expression was 
upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and downregulated in lung squamous cell 
carcinoma. For the other five genes (STMN2, SPINK6, TUSC3, LOC100128054, and 
C8orf22), we found that STMN2, TUSC3 and C8orf22 were upregulated in squamous 
cell carcinoma and that STMN2 and USC3 were upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma. 
Furthermore, we compared the correlation between HOXA11-AS and de-regulated 
genes in NSCLC based on TCGA. The results showed that the HOXA11-AS expression 
was negatively correlated with DOCK8 in squamous cell carcinoma (r = -0.124, 
P = 0.048) and lung adenocarcinoma (r = -0.176, P = 0.005). In addition, RSPO3, 
ADAMTS8 and DOCK8 were related to overall survival and disease-free survival 
(all P < 0.05) of lung adenocarcinoma patients in TCGA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the gene profiles were significantly 
changed after HOXA11-AS knock-down in NSCLC cells. We speculated that HOXA11-AS 
may play an important role in NSCLC development and progression by regulating 
the expression of various pathways and genes, especially DOCK8 and TGF-beta 
pathway. However, the exact mechanism should be verified by functional 
experiments.
