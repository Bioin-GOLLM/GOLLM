Cleft palate only is a common birth defect with high heritability. Only a small 
fraction of this heritability is explained by the genetic variants identified so 
far, underscoring the need to investigate other disease mechanisms, such as 
gene-environment (GxE) interactions and parent-of-origin (PoO) effects. 
Furthermore, PoO effects may vary across exposure levels (PoOxE effects). Such 
variation is the focus of this study. We upgraded the R-package Haplin to enable 
direct tests of PoOxE effects at the genome-wide level. From a previous GWAS, we 
had genotypes for 550 case-parent trios, of mainly European and Asian ancestry, 
and data on three maternal exposures (smoking, alcohol, and vitamins). Data were 
analyzed for Europeans and Asians separately, and also for all ethnicities 
combined. To account for multiple testing, a false discovery rate method was 
used, where q-values were generated from the p-values. In the Europeans-only 
analyses, interactions with maternal smoking yielded the lowest q-values. Two 
SNPs in the 'Interactor of little elongation complex ELL subunit 1' (ICE1) gene 
had a q-value of 0.14, and five of the 20 most significant SNPs were in the 
'N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase-like 2' (NAALADL2) gene. No 
evidence of PoOxE effects was found in the other analyses. The connections to 
ICE1 and NAALADL2 are novel and warrant further investigation. More generally, 
the new methodology presented here is easily applicable to other traits and 
exposures in which a family-based study design has been implemented.
