Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of death from cancer in men. 
The mechanism underlying tumorigenesis and development of PCa is largely 
unknown. Here, we identified Kinesin family member 14 (KIF14) as a novel 
candidate oncogene in PCa. We found that KIF14 was overexpressed in multiple PCa 
cell lines and primary PCa tissues. Knockdown of KIF14 in DU145 and PC3 prostate 
cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and 
apoptosis. Transcriptome analysis by RNA-sequencing demonstrated that KIF4 
suppression led to transcriptional changes of genes involved in p53 and TGF-beta 
signaling pathway. In addition, upregulated expression of GADD45A, GADD45B, p21, 
PIDD and Shisa5, which contribute to growth arrest and apoptosis induction, and 
downregulated CCNB1 that promotes cell cycle progression were confirmed by 
quantitative real-time PCR after KIF4 knockdown. We further found that KIF14 
protein level was positively correlated with T stage and Gleason Score. Patients 
with higher KIF14 expression had shorter overall survival time than those with 
lower KIF14 expression. Thus, our data indicate that KIF14 could act as a 
potential oncogene that contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis in 
PCa, which may represent a novel and useful prognostic biomarker for PCa.
