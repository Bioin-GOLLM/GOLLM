Methylation of DNA, protein, and even RNA species are integral processes in 
epigenesis. Enzymes that catalyze these reactions using the donor 
S-adenosylmethionine fall into several structurally distinct classes. The 
members in each class share sequence similarity that can be used to identify 
additional methyltransferases. Here, we characterize these classes and in silico 
approaches to infer protein function. Computational methods such as hidden 
Markov model profiling and the Multiple Motif Scanning program can be used to 
analyze known methyltransferases and relay information into the prediction of 
new ones. In some cases, the substrate of methylation can be inferred from 
hidden Markov model sequence similarity networks. Functional identification of 
these candidate species is much more difficult; we discuss one biochemical 
approach.
