Despite the enormous population benefits of routine vaccination, vaccine adverse 
events (AEs) and reactions, whether real or perceived, have posed one of the 
greatest barriers to vaccine acceptance--and thus to infectious disease 
prevention--worldwide. A truly integrated clinical, translational, and basic 
science approach is required to understand the mechanisms behind vaccine AEs, 
predict them, and then apply this knowledge to new vaccine design approaches 
that decrease, or avoid, these events. The term 'adversomics' was first 
introduced in 2009 and refers to the study of vaccine adverse reactions using 
immunogenomics and systems biology approaches. In this review, we present the 
current state of adversomics research, review known associations and mechanisms 
of vaccine AEs/reactions, and outline a plan for the further development of this 
emerging research field.
