The steady increase of inhalant abuse is a great challenge for analytical 
toxicologists. This review describes an overview of inhalant abuse including the 
extent of the problem, types of products abused, modes of administration, 
pharmacology and effects of inhalants, the role of laboratory, interpretation of 
laboratory results and clinical considerations. Regular laboratory screening for 
inhalant abuse as well as other substance abuse and health risk behaviors must 
be a part of standard clinical care.
