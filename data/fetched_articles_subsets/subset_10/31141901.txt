A UHPLC-QQQ-MS/MS method was developed to quantify the significant constituents 
in Wen-Dan Decoction (WDD), a traditional Chinese medicine. Analysis of 19 
compounds was conducted on an ACQUITY UPLC® BEH C18 Column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) 
using elution with a gradient elution of acetonitrile and 0.05% (v/v) formic 
acid in water. A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in negative 
ionization mode and positive ionization mode by multiple reaction monitoring 
(MRM), respectively. All calibration curves showed acceptable linearity (r ≥ 
0.9950). The RSDs of intra- and inter-day precisions of low, mid and high 
concentrations were ≤ 8.88%. The repeatabilities (RSDs ≤ 7.17%) and stabilities 
(RSD ≤ 4.79%) of the samples were qualified. The recoveries were found in the 
range of 93.07 ± 3.86 to 103.98 ± 2.98% with the RSD varying between 1.30 and 
7.86%. The final rapid, sensitive, precise, accurate and reliable 
UHPLC-QQQ-MS/MS method was used for the simultaneous quantification of 19 
constituents in WDD and its commercial preparations. The strategy of combining 
the contents of the 19 chemicals in a daily dose of the WDD preparations with 
the hierarchical cluster analysis and the 3D principal component analysis was 
employed to effectively distinguish the WDD preparations provided by the 
different suppliers, which represents a contribution to the evaluation and 
control of the quality of WDD (or other decoctions consisting of the same herbs) 
and the preparations of WDD in other dosage forms such as tablets and granules.
