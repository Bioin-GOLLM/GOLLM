We explored the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
ACYP2 and liver cancer risk. Thirteen SNPs were genotyped in 473 cases and 564 
controls. Genetic model, linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analyses were 
performed to evaluate the association between ACPY2 SNPs and liver cancer risk. 
We found that rs6713088 (G allele: odds ratio [OR] = 1.27, 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.07-1.52, P = 0.007; GG vs. CC: OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.02-2.1, P = 
0.038), rs843711 (T allele: OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.09-1.54, P = 0.004; TT vs. CC: 
OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.13-2.31, P = 0.008), rs843706 (A allele: OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 
1.09-1.55, P = 0.003; AA vs. CC: OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.13-2.31, P = 0.008), and 
rs843645 (GG vs. AG: OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.07-1.82, P = 0.014) were associated 
with an increased risk of liver cancer. In contrast, rs1682111 (A allele: OR = 
0.77, 95% CI: 0.640-0.94, P = 0.007; AT vs. TT: OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.91, P 
= 0.007), rs843720 (additive model: OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-1.00, P = 0.049), 
ATATCGCC and CG haplotypes (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.62-0.92, P = 0.006; OR = 0.78, 
95% CI: 0.65-0.93, P = 0.006, respectively) were significantly decreased liver 
cancer risk. Our results confirmed that rs6713088, rs843645, rs843711 and 
rs843706 were significantly increased liver cancer risk, but rs1682111, rs843720 
and haplotypes (ATATCGCC and CG) were significantly decreased liver cancer risk 
in a Han Chinese population.
