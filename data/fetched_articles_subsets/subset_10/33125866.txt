Mucus is a densely populated ecological niche that coats all non-keratinized 
epithelia, and plays a critical role in protecting the human body from 
infections. Although traditionally viewed as a physical barrier, emerging 
evidence suggests that mucus can directly suppress virulence-associated traits 
in opportunistic pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the 
molecular mechanisms by which mucus affords this protection are unclear. Here, 
we show that mucins, and particularly their associated glycans, signal through 
the Dismed2 domain of the sensor kinase RetS in P. aeruginosa. We find that this 
RetS-dependent signaling leads to the direct inhibition of the GacS-GacA 
two-component system, the activity of which is associated with a chronic 
infection state. This signaling includes downregulation of the type VI secretion 
system (T6SS), and prevents T6SS-dependent bacterial killing by P. aeruginosa. 
Overall, these results shed light on how mucus impacts P. aeruginosa behavior, 
and may inspire novel approaches for controlling P. aeruginosa infections.
