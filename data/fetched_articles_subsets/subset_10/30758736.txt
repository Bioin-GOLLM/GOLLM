Eculizumab is the first drug approved for the treatment of complement-mediated 
diseases, and current dosage schedules result in large interindividual drug 
concentrations. This review provides insight into the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic properties of eculizumab, both for reported on-label (paroxysmal 
nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, generalized 
myasthenia gravis) and off-label (hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy) indications. Furthermore, 
we discuss the potential of therapeutic drug monitoring to individualize 
treatment and reduce costs.
