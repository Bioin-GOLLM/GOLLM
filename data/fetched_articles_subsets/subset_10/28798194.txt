Metabolism is of central importance for T cell survival and differentiation. It 
is well known that T cells cannot function in the absence of glucose, but it is 
less clear how they respond to excessive levels of glucose. In the present 
study, we investigated how increasing levels of glucose affect T-cell-mediated 
immune responses. We examined the effects of increased levels of glucose on CD8+ 
T-cell behaviour in vitro by assessing activation and cytokine production, as 
well as oxygen consumption rate (OCR), extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) 
and intracellular signalling. In addition, we assessed in vivo proliferation, 
cytokine production and cytolytic activity of cells in chemically induced 
diabetic C57BL/6 mice. Elevated levels of glucose in in vitro cultures had 
modest effects on proliferation and cytokine production, while in vivo 
hyperglycaemia had no effect on CD8+ T-cell proliferation, interferon γ (IFNγ) 
production or cytolytic killing.
