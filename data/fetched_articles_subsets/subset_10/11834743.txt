The STAT1 transcription factor is organized into several highly conserved 
domains, each of which has been assigned a function with the exception of the 
linker domain. We previously characterized a mutant in the linker domain of 
STAT1 that gave normal DNA binding using a standard probe in an electrophoretic 
mobility assay but failed to activate transcription in response to interferon 
gamma. We now report the mechanistic basis for the inactivity of this 
STAT1(K544A/E545A) mutant. Rather than failing to attract transcriptional 
coactivators, the STAT1(K544A/E545A) mutant has a subtle biophysical defect, 
which prevents accumulation of the activated protein on chromatin in vivo: the 
mutant has comparable K(d) with greatly increased k(off) for DNA binding. The 
increase in both on-rate and off-rate of DNA binding results in a substantially 
reduced residence time of STAT1(K544A/E545A) on STAT binding sites. We find a 
similar correlation between off-rate and transcriptional potency for 
STAT1(N460A), which bears a mutation in the DNA binding domain. These results 
yield insight into the rate of complex assembly involving STAT1 that leads to 
transcriptional stimulation.
