Activators of bacterial sigma54-RNA polymerase holoenzyme are mechanochemical 
proteins that use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to activate 
transcription. We have determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) a 
20 angstrom resolution structure of an activator, phage shock protein F 
[PspF(1-275)], which is bound to an ATP transition state analog in complex with 
its basal factor, sigma54. By fitting the crystal structure of PspF(1-275) at 
1.75 angstroms into the EM map, we identified two loops involved in binding 
sigma54. Comparing enhancer-binding structures in different nucleotide states 
and mutational analysis led us to propose nucleotide-dependent conformational 
changes that free the loops for association with sigma54.
