Thymidylate synthase (TSase) catalyzes the intracellular de novo formation of 
thymidylate (a DNA building block) in most living organisms, making it a common 
target for chemotherapeutic and antibiotic drugs. Two mechanisms have been 
proposed for the rate-limiting hydride transfer step in TSase catalysis: a 
stepwise mechanism in which the hydride transfer precedes the cleavage of the 
covalent bond between the enzymatic cysteine and the product and a mechanism 
where both happen concertedly. Striking similarities between the enzyme-bound 
enolate intermediates formed in the initial and final step of the reaction 
supported the first mechanism, while QM/MM calculations favored the concerted 
mechanism. Here, we experimentally test these two possibilities using secondary 
kinetic isotope effect (KIE), mutagenesis study, and primary KIEs. The findings 
support the concerted mechanism and demonstrate the critical role of an active 
site arginine in substrate binding, activation of enzymatic nucleophile, and the 
hydride transfer studied here. The elucidation of this reduction/substitution 
sheds light on the critical catalytic step in TSase and may aid future drug or 
biomimetic catalyst design.
