BRCA1 mutations have been identified that increase the risk of developing 
hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Genetic screening is now offered to 
patients with a family history of cancer, to adapt their treatment and the 
management of their relatives. However, a large number of BRCA1 variants of 
uncertain significance (VUS) are detected. To better understand the significance 
of these variants, a high-throughput structural and functional analysis was 
performed on a large set of BRCA1 VUS. Information on both cellular localization 
and homology-directed DNA repair (HR) capacity was obtained for 78 BRCT missense 
variants in the UMD-BRCA1 database and measurement of the structural stability 
and phosphopeptide-binding capacities was performed for 42 mutated BRCT domains. 
This extensive and systematic analysis revealed that most characterized causal 
variants affect BRCT-domain solubility in bacteria and all impair BRCA1 HR 
activity in cells. Furthermore, binding to a set of 5 different phosphopeptides 
was tested: all causal variants showed phosphopeptide-binding defects and no 
neutral variant showed such defects. A classification is presented on the basis 
of mutated BRCT domain solubility, phosphopeptide-binding properties, and VUS HR 
capacity. These data suggest that HR-defective variants, which present, in 
addition, BRCT domains either insoluble in bacteria or defective for 
phosphopeptide binding, lead to an increased cancer risk. Furthermore, the data 
suggest that variants with a WT HR activity and whose BRCT domains bind with a 
WT affinity to the 5 phosphopeptides are neutral. The case of variants with WT 
HR activity and defective phosphopeptide binding should be further 
characterized, as this last functional defect might be sufficient per se to lead 
to tumorigenesis. IMPLICATIONS: The analysis of the current study on BRCA1 
structural and functional defects on cancer risk and classification presented 
may improve clinical interpretation and therapeutic selection.
