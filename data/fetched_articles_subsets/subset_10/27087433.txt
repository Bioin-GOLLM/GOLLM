RATIONALE: Experimental data informs that not only do the dose and time duration 
of dependent drugs affect the severity of withdrawal episodes. Previous 
withdrawal experiences may intensify this process, which is referred as 
sensitization to withdrawal signs. Adenosine and dopamine (DA) receptors may be 
involved in this sensitization.
OBJECTIVES: Rats were continuously and sporadically treated with increasing 
doses of morphine for 8 days. In rats, sporadically treated with morphine, 
morphine administration was modified by adding three morphine-free periods. 
Adenosine agonists were given during each of the morphine-free periods (six 
injections in total). On the 9th day, morphine was injected. One hour later, 
naloxone was administered to induce morphine withdrawal signs. Then, the animals 
were placed into cylinders and the number of jumpings was recorded. Next, the 
rats were decapitated and brain and brain structures (striatum, hippocampus, and 
prefrontal cortex) were dissected for neurochemical, molecular, and 
immunohistochemical experiments within DAergic pathways.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that previous experiences of opioid withdrawal 
intensified subsequent withdrawal signs. Adenosine ligands attenuated the 
sensitization to withdrawal signs. In a neurochemical study, the release of DA 
and its metabolites was impaired in all structures. Significant alterations were 
also observed in mRNA and protein expression of DA receptors.
CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that intermittent treatment with morphine 
induces alterations in the DAergic system which may be responsible for 
sensitization to morphine withdrawal signs. Although adenosine ligands attenuate 
this type of sensitization, they are not able to fully restore the physiological 
brain status.
