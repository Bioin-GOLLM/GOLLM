Sclerostin, a secreted glycoprotein, regulates osteoblast function. Using yeast 
two-hybrid and direct protein interaction analyses, we demonstrate that 
sclerostin binds the Wnt-modulating and Wnt-modulated, extracellular matrix 
protein, cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61, CCN1), which regulates mesenchymal 
stem cell proliferation and differentiation, osteoblast and osteoclast function, 
and angiogenesis. Sclerostin was shown to inhibit Cyr61-mediated fibroblast 
attachment, and Cyr61 together with sclerostin increases vascular endothelial 
cell migration and increases osteoblast cell division. The data show that 
sclerostin binds to and influences the activity of Cyr61.
