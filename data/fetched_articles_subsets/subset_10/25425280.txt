BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is implicated in a variety 
of clinically important diseases, notably rheumatoid arthritis and 
atherosclerosis. Consequently, antagonists of CXCR3 are of therapeutic interest. 
In this study, we set out to characterize binding sites of the specific low MW 
CXCR3 antagonist VUF10085 and the broad spectrum antagonist TAK-779 which blocks 
CXCR3 along with CCR2 and CCR5.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Molecular modelling of CXCR3, followed by virtual ligand 
docking, highlighted several CXCR3 residues likely to contact either antagonist, 
notably a conserved aspartate in helix 2 (Asp-112(2:63) ), which was postulated 
to interact with the quaternary nitrogen of TAK-779. Validation of modelling was 
carried out by site-directed mutagenesis of CXCR3, followed by assays of cell 
surface expression, ligand binding and receptor activation.
KEY RESULTS: Mutation of Asn-132(3.33) , Phe-207 and Tyr-271(6.51) within CXCR3 
severely impaired both ligand binding and chemotactic responses, suggesting that 
these residues are critical for maintenance of a functional CXCR3 conformation. 
Contrary to our hypothesis, mutation of Asp-112(2:63) had no observable effects 
on TAK-779 activity, but clearly decreased the antagonist potency of VUF 10085. 
Likewise, mutations of Phe-131(3.32) , Ile-279(6.59) and Tyr-308(7.43) were well 
tolerated and were critical for the antagonist activity of VUF 10085 but not for 
that of TAK-779.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This more detailed definition of a binding pocket 
within CXCR3 for low MW antagonists should facilitate the rational design of 
newer CXCR3 antagonists, with obvious clinical potential.
