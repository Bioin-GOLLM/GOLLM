Mutagenesis of a fungus Mucor pusillus, a producer of an aspartic proteinase 
named Mucor pusillus rennin (MPR), was performed to obtain the mutated enzymes 
with decreased thermostability, which is desirable for practical use of the 
enzyme as a milk coagulant for cheese manufacturing. A fungal mutant strain 
which produced the mutant enzyme with distinctly reduced thermostability was 
isolated. Two different mutant alleles of the mpr gene, one with a single amino 
acid exchange of Ala101 for Thr and the other of Gly186 for Asp, were cloned out 
of this mutant strain. The mutated mpr genes were expressed in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae under the control of the yeast GAL7 promoter to produce the active 
enzymes in extracellular medium. Both of the mutations, especially Gly186Asp, 
were confirmed to cause a marked decrease in thermostability of the enzyme. All 
mutants possessing exchanges of Gly186 for various amino acids by site-directed 
mutagenesis showed a decrease in thermostability, indicating involvement of this 
residue to maintain a conformation of the enzyme. A double mutant having the 
both exchanges, Ala101Thr and Gly186Asp, in a single molecule showed the lowest 
thermostability without decrease in the enzymatic activity as well as the 
relative ratio of clotting to proteolytic activity.
