BACKGROUND: Drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis prevention and care is a 
major challenge in Ethiopia. The World health organization has designated 
Ethiopia as one of the 30 high burden multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) 
countries. There is limited information regarding genetic diversity and 
transmission dynamics of MDR-TB in Ethiopia.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular epidemiology and transmission dynamics 
of MDR-TB strains using whole genome sequence (WGS) in the Amhara region.
METHODS: Forty-five MDR-TB clinical isolates from Amhara region were collected 
between 2016 and 2018, and characterized using WGS and 24-loci Mycobacterium 
Interspersed Repetitive Units Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) 
typing. Clusters were defined based on the maximum distance of 12 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or alleles as the upper threshold of genomic 
relatedness. Five or less SNPs or alleles distance or identical 24-loci VNTR 
typing is denoted as surrogate marker for recent transmission.
RESULTS: Forty-one of the 45 isolates were analyzed by WGS and 44% (18/41) of 
the isolates were distributed into 4 clusters. Of the 41 MDR-TB isolates, 58.5% 
were classified as lineage 4, 36.5% lineage 3 and 5% lineage 1. Overall, TUR 
genotype (54%) was the predominant in MDR-TB strains. 41% (17/41) of the 
isolates were clustered into four WGS groups and the remaining isolates were 
unique strains. The predominant cluster (Cluster 1) was composed of nine 
isolates belonging to lineage 4 and of these, four isolates were in the recent 
transmission links.
CONCLUSIONS: Majority of MDR-TB strain cluster and predominance of TUR lineage 
in the Amhara region give rise to concerns for possible ongoing transmission. 
Efforts to strengthen TB laboratory to advance diagnosis, intensified active 
case finding, and expanded contact tracing activities are needed in order to 
improve rapid diagnosis and initiate early treatment. This would lead to the 
interruption of the transmission chain and stop the spread of MDR-TB in the 
Amhara region.
