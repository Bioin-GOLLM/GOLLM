OBJECTIVE: Renalase, a novel secretory flavoprotein with amine oxidase activity, 
is secreted into the blood by the kidneys and is hypothesized to participate in 
blood pressure (BP) regulation. We investigated the associations of renalase 
with BP and the risk of hypertension by examining renalase single nucleopeptide 
polymorphism (SNPs), serum renalase levels, and renal expression of renalase in 
humans.
METHODS: ① Subjects (n = 514) from the original Baoji Salt-Sensitive Study 
cohort were genotyped to investigate the association of renalase SNPs with 
longitudinal BP changes and the risk of hypertension during 14 years of 
follow-up. ② Two thousand three hundred and ninety two participants from the 
Hanzhong Adolescent Hypertension Study cohort were used to examine the 
association of serum renalase levels with hypertension. Renalase expression in 
renal biopsy specimens from 193 patients were measured by immunohistochemistry. 
③ Renalase expression was compared in hypertensive vs. normotensive patients.
RESULTS: ① SNP rs7922058 was associated with 14-year change in systolic BP, and 
rs10887800, rs796945, rs1935582, rs2296545, and rs2576178 were significantly 
associated with 14-year change in diastolic BP while rs1935582 and rs2576178 
were associated with mean arterial pressure change over 14 years. In addition, 
SNPs rs796945, rs1935582, and rs2576178 were significantly associated with 
hypertension incidence. Gene-based analysis found that renalase gene was 
significantly associated with hypertension incidence over 14-year follow-up 
after adjustment for multiple measurements. ② Hypertensive subjects had higher 
serum renalase levels than normotensive subjects (27.2 ± 0.4 vs. 25.1 ± 0.2 
μg/mL). Serum renalase levels and BPs showed a linear correlation. In addition, 
serum renalase was significantly associated with the risk of hypertension [OR = 
1.018 (1.006-1.030)]. ③ The expression of renalase in human renal biopsy 
specimens significantly decreased in hypertensive patients compared to 
non-hypertensive patients (0.030 ± 0.001 vs. 0.038 ± 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that renalase may play an important role in 
BP progression and development of hypertension.
