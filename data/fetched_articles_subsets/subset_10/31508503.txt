The core diagnostic criteria for autism comprise two symptom domains - social 
and communication difficulties, and unusually repetitive and restricted 
behaviour, interests and activities. There is some evidence to suggest that 
these two domains are dissociable, though this hypothesis has not yet been 
tested using molecular genetics. We test this using a genome-wide association 
study (N = 51,564) of a non-social trait related to autism, systemising, defined 
as the drive to analyse and build systems. We demonstrate that systemising is 
heritable and genetically correlated with autism. In contrast, we do not 
identify significant genetic correlations between social autistic traits and 
systemising. Supporting this, polygenic scores for systemising are significantly 
and positively associated with restricted and repetitive behaviour but not with 
social difficulties in autistic individuals. These findings strongly suggest 
that the two core domains of autism are genetically dissociable, and point at 
how to fractionate the genetics of autism.
