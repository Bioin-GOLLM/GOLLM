An increasing number of studies suggest that subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is 
associated with complications of gestation, including spontaneous abortion (SA). 
However, the underlying mechanism is not clear. MicroRNA (miRNA) has been 
demonstrated to be closely related to gynecological reproductive diseases. We 
determined miRNA expression in patients with SCH, SCH with SA (SCH + SA), and in 
those with SA as well as healthy controls (HCs), and analyzed whether 
dysregulation in several miRNAs was specific to these cohorts. An Agilent Human 
miRNA array was used to explore miRNA levels in pooled serum samples as a pilot 
study, followed by a validation of selected miRNAs by real-time polymerase chain 
reaction in SCH (N = 24), SA (N = 19), SCH + SA (N = 21), and HC cohorts 
(N = 18). The relative expression of miR-940 was elevated in the SCH + SA group 
compared with SCH, SA, and HC groups. In addition, miR-486-5p was upregulated in 
the SCH + SA group compared with SA and HC groups, without a difference noted 
between SCH + SA and SCH groups. Further analysis suggested that miR-940 or 
miR-486-5p may be potential predictive biomarkers for the early diagnosis of SA 
in patients with SCH.
