OBJECTIVES: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a standard care option in 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) mutation. TKI-based combination treatment modes show encouraging 
outcomes. However, it remains unknown which is the optimal treatment as the 
first-line regimen for these patients on overall survival (OS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trials and meeting abstracts that 
investigated EGFR-TKIs alone or in combination as front-line care for patients 
with NSCLC were systematically searched in relevant databases and reviewed. 
Fixed and random effects network meta-analysis models were used to estimate 
progression-free survival (PFS), OS, overall response rate, and grade three and 
higher adverse events (AEs). Surface under the cumulative ranking curves 
(SUCRAs) were used to rank treatment effects.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies covering six treatments and involving a total of 4389 
patients were included in this network meta-analysis. On OS, the top three 
treatment were first-generation EGFR-TKIs (1G EGFR-TKIs) plus chemotherapy 
(SUCRA, 88.1%), osimertinib (SUCRA, 65.8%) and second-generation EGFR-TKIs 
(2GEGFR-TKIs) (SUCRA, 63.3%). On PFS, the top three treatments were osimertinib 
(SUCRA, 96.0%), 1G EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy (SUCRA, 67.1%), and 1G EGFR-TKIs 
plus antiangiogenesis (SUCRA, 48.2%). Two types of TKI-based combination therapy 
have significantly higher risk of grade three and higher AEs than TKI alone.
CONCLUSION: 1G EGFR-TKIs plus chemotherapy and osimertinib seem to be the two 
better options as first-line care in advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR-mutation. 
Osimertinib caused the lowest incidence of AEs. However, TKIs-based combination 
therapy significantly increased AEs.
