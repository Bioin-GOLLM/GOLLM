Microsomal cytochrome b5 plays a key role in the oxidation of a variety of 
exogenous and endogenous compounds, including drugs, fatty acids, cholesterol 
and steroid hormones. To better understand its functional properties in a 
membrane mimic environment, we carried out high-resolution solution NMR studies. 
Here we report resonance assignments for full-length rabbit cytochrome b5 
embedded in dodecylphosphocholine micelles.
