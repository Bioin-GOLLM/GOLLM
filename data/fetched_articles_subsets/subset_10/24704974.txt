The bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pathovar musacearum (Xcm) is the causal 
agent of banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW). This disease has devastated economies 
based on banana and plantain crops (Musa species) in East Africa. Here we use 
genome-wide sequencing to discover a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) among East African isolates of Xcm. These SNPs have potential as 
molecular markers for phylogeographic studies of the epidemiology and spread of 
the pathogen. Our analysis reveals two major sub-lineages of the pathogen, 
suggesting that the current outbreaks of BXW on Musa species in the region may 
have more than one introductory event, perhaps from Ethiopia. Also, based on 
comparisons of genome-wide sequence data from multiple isolates of Xcm and 
multiple strains of X. vasicola pathovar vasculorum, we identify genes specific 
to Xcm that could be used to specifically detect Xcm by PCR-based methods.
