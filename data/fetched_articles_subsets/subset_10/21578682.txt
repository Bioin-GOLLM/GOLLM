In the binuclear title complex, 
[Ag(2)(C(31)H(22)N(4)O)(2)](ClO(4))(2)·2C(3)H(7)NO, the Ag(I) atom is 
penta-coordinated by three N atoms from the tridentate chelating terpyridyl 
group and by one N atom and one O atom from the quinolin-8-yl-oxy group in a 
distorted square-pyramidal geometry with the O atom at the apical position. The 
centrosymmetric complex cation involves intra-molecular π-π stacking 
inter-actions [centroid-centroid distance = 3.862 (4) Å] between the central 
pyridine and benzene rings. In the crystal structure, inter-molecular C-H⋯O 
hydrogen bonds result in the formation of a supra-molecular network.
