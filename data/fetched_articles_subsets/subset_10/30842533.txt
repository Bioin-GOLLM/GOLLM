Masking is a direct behavioral response to environmental changes and plays an 
important role in the temporal distribution of activity. However, the mechanisms 
responsible for masking remain unclear. Here we identify thermosensors and a 
possible neural circuit regulating temperature-dependent masking behavior in 
mice. Analysis of mice lacking thermosensitive transient receptor potential 
(TRP) channels (Trpv1/3/4 and Trpm2/8) reveals that temperature-dependent 
masking is impaired in Trpm2- and Trpm8-null mice. Several brain regions are 
activated during temperature-dependent masking, including the preoptic area 
(POA), known as the thermoregulatory center, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), 
which is the primary circadian pacemaker, the paraventricular nucleus of the 
thalamus (PVT), and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The POA, SCN, PVT are 
interconnected, and the PVT sends dense projections to the NAc, a key brain 
region involved in wheel-running activity. Partial chemical lesion of the PVT 
attenuates masking, suggesting the involvement of the PVT in 
temperature-dependent masking behavior.
