A gene involved in psoriasis susceptibility was localized to the distal region 
of human chromosome 17q as a result of a genome-wide linkage analysis with 
polymorphic microsatellites and eight multiply affected psoriasis kindreds. In 
the family which showed the strongest evidence for linkage, the recombination 
fraction between a psoriasis susceptibility locus and D17S784 was 0.04 with a 
maximum two-point lod score of 5.33. There was also evidence for genetic 
heterogeneity and although none of the linked families showed any association 
with HLA-Cw6, two unlinked families showed weak levels of association. This 
study demonstrates that in some families, psoriasis susceptibility is due to 
variation at a single major genetic locus other than the human lymphocyte 
antigen locus.
