Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the 
presence of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The impaired synaptic 
plasticity and dendritic loss at the synaptic level is an early event associated 
with the AD pathogenesis. The abnormal accumulation of soluble oligomeric 
amyloid-β (Aβ), the major toxic component in amyloid plaques, is viewed to 
trigger synaptic dysfunctions through binding to several presynaptic and 
postsynaptic partners and thus to disrupt synaptic transmission. Over time, the 
abnormalities in neural transmission will result in cognitive deficits, which 
are commonly manifested as memory loss in AD patients. Synaptic plasticity is 
regulated through glutamate transmission, which is mediated by various glutamate 
receptors. Here we review recent progresses in the study of metabotropic 
glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in AD cognition. We will discuss the role of mGluRs 
in synaptic plasticity and their modulation as a possible strategy for AD 
cognitive improvement.
