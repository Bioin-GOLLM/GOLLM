Activation of glutaminase by phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate and its interference 
with the assay of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase.

Hahn R, Oberrauch W, Mecke D.

Phosphate-dependent glutaminase (L-glutamine amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.2) from 
rat liver was found to be strongly activated by phosphoribosylpyrophosphate 
(P-rib-PP), the substrate of amidophosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.14). Since 
the assay of the latter is based on the P-rib-PP-dependent conversion of 
glutamine to glutamate, the amidotransferase activities determined in crude 
tissue preparations were found to be too high. The interference of glutaminase, 
however, could be completely eliminated by its inactivation at 50 degrees C. 
Amidotransferase was not affected by the heat treatment. Because of the 
increased rate of the glutamate formation at this temperature, the incubation 
time of the assay could be significantly reduced.
