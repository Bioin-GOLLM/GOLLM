While the advent of GWAS more than a decade ago has ushered in remarkable 
advances in our understanding of complex traits, the limitations of single-SNP 
analysis have also led to the development of several other approaches. 
Simulation studies have shown that the regional heritability mapping (RHM) 
method, which makes use of multiple adjacent SNPs jointly to estimate the 
genetic effect of a given region of the genome, generally has higher detection 
power than single-SNP GWAS. However, thus far its use has been mostly limited to 
agricultural settings, and its potential for the discovery of new genes in human 
diseases is yet to be fully exploited. In this study, by applying the RHM method 
to primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in the Japanese population, we identified 
three novel loci (STAT4, ULK4, and KCNH5) at the genome-wide significance level, 
two of which (ULK4 and KCNH5) have not been found associated with PBC in any 
population previously. Notably, these genes could not be detected by using 
conventional single-SNP GWAS, highlighting the potential of the RHM method for 
the detection of new susceptibility loci in human diseases. These findings 
thereby provide strong empirical evidence that RHM is an effective and practical 
complementary approach to GWAS in this context. Also, liver tissue mRNA 
microarray analysis revealed higher gene expression levels in ULK4 in PBC 
patients (P < 0.01). Lastly, we estimated the common SNP heritability of PBC in 
the Japanese population (0.210 ± 0.026).
