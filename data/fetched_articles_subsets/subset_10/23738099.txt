Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) has been associated with syndromes grouped by 
the term porcine circovirus associated diseases (PCVAD). The PCV-2 isolates have 
been grouped into two major groups or genotypes according to their nucleotide 
sequence of whole genomes and/or ORF-2: PCV-2b, which have, in turn, been 
subdivided into three clusters (1A-1C), and PCV-2a, which has been subdivided 
into five clusters (2A-2E). In the present study, we obtained 16 sequences of 
PCV-2 from different farms from 2003 to 2008, from animals with confirmatory 
diagnosis of PCVAD. Since results showed an identity of 99.8% among them, they 
were grouped within a common cluster 1A-B. This preliminary study suggests a 
stable circulation of PCV-2b among the Argentinean pig population.
