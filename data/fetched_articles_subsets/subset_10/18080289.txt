BACKGROUND: Anticoagulant resistance in Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus (Berk.), 
has been suggested to be conferred by mutations in the VKORC1 gene, encoding the 
target protein of anticoagulant rodenticides. Other factors, e.g. 
pharmacokinetics, may also contribute to resistance, however. To examine the 
involvement of pharmacokinetics in bromadiolone resistance in male and female 
rats, liver expression profiles of seven cytochrome P450 genes from a Danish 
bromadiolone-resistant rat strain (with an Y139C-VKORC1 mutation) were compared 
with profiles from an anticoagulant-susceptible strain.
RESULTS: In the presence of bromadiolone, the Cyp2e1, Cyp2c13, Cyp3a2 and Cyp3a3 
genes were significantly overexpressed, while Cyp2c12 expression was suppressed 
in resistant female rats compared with susceptible females. Relative to 
susceptible males, resistant males showed significant overexpression of the 
Cyp2a1, Cyp2e1, Cyp3a2 and Cyp3a3 genes. On exposure to bromadiolone, females 
had higher Cyp2e1 expression than males, which possibly explains why female rats 
are generally more tolerant to anticoagulants than male rats.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that bromadiolone resistance in a Danish strain of 
Norway rats involves enhanced anticoagulant metabolism catalysed by cytochrome 
P450-2e1, -3a2 and -3a3. This pharmacokinetically based bromadiolone resistance 
is to some extent sex differentiated, as female resistance furthermore seems to 
involve overexpression of cytochrome P450-2c13 and suppression of P450-2c12, 
whereas male resistance appears to involve P450-2a1 overexpression.
