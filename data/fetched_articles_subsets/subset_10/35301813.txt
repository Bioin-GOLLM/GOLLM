BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is the 
current focus in cancer immunotherapy. However, issues are raised in the area, 
as the recent studies showed that such therapeutic modality suffers from low 
durability and low or no efficacy for patients with some tumor types including 
cases with non-inflamed or cold cancers. Therefore, efforts have been made to 
solve the issue using immune combination therapy, such as the use of 
immunocytokines. The combination of ICI with interleukins (ILs) and IL-targeting 
agents is now under consideration in the area of therapy, and the primary 
results are promising.
PURPOSE: The focus of this review is to discuss the possibility of using ILs and 
IL-targeting drugs in combination with ICI in cancer immunotherapy and 
describing recent advances in the field using PEGylated ILs and fusion proteins. 
The key focus in this area is to reduce adverse events and to increase the 
efficacy and durability of such combination therapy.
