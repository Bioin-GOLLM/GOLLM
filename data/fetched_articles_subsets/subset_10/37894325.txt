Despite recent advances in treatment, melanoma remains the deadliest form of 
skin cancer due to its highly metastatic nature. Melanomas harboring oncogenic 
BRAFV600E mutations combined with PTEN loss exhibit unrestrained PI3K/AKT 
signaling and increased invasiveness. However, the contribution of different AKT 
isoforms to melanoma initiation, progression, and metastasis has not been 
comprehensively explored, and questions remain about whether individual isoforms 
play distinct or redundant roles in each step. We investigate the contribution 
of individual AKT isoforms to melanoma initiation using a novel mouse model of 
AKT isoform-specific loss in a murine melanoma model, and we investigate tumor 
progression, maintenance, and metastasis among a panel of human metastatic 
melanoma cell lines using AKT isoform-specific knockdown studies. We elucidate 
that AKT2 is dispensable for primary tumor formation but promotes migration and 
invasion in vitro and metastatic seeding in vivo, whereas AKT1 is uniquely 
important for melanoma initiation and cell proliferation. We propose a mechanism 
whereby the inhibition of AKT2 impairs glycolysis and reduces an EMT-related 
gene expression signature in PTEN-null BRAF-mutant human melanoma cells to limit 
metastatic spread. Our data suggest that the elucidation of AKT2-specific 
functions in metastasis might inform therapeutic strategies to improve treatment 
options for melanoma patients.
