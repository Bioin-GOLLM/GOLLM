Biological therapies, such as TNF inhibitors (TNFi), are increasing remission 
(REM) rates in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, although these are still 
limited. The aim of our study was to analyze changes in the profile of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with RA treated with TNFi 
in relation to the clinical response. This is a prospective and observational 
study including 78 RA patients starting the first TNFi. PBMC were analyzed by 
flow cytometry both at baseline and at 6 months. Disease activity at the same 
time points was assessed by DAS28, establishing DAS28 ≤ 2.6 as the criteria for 
REM. Logistic regression models were employed to analyze the association between 
the changes in PBMC and REM. After 6 months of TNFi treatment, 37% patients 
achieved REM by DAS28. Patients who achieved REM showed a reduction in the 
percentage of naive B cells, but only when patients had received concomitant 
methotrexate (MTX) (OR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39-0.91). However, no association was 
found for patients who did not receive concomitant MTX (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 
0.63-1.16). In conclusion, PBMC, mainly the B-cell subsets, are modified in RA 
patients with TNFi who achieve clinical REM. A significant decrease in naive 
B-cell percentage is associated with achieving REM after 6 months of TNFi 
treatment in patients who received concomitant therapy with MTX.
