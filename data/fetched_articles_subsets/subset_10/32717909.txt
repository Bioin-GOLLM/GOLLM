Src, originally identified as an oncogene, is a membrane-anchored tyrosine 
kinase and the Src family kinase (SFK) prototype. SFKs regulate the signalling 
induced by a wide range of cell surface receptors leading to epithelial cell 
growth and adhesion. In the intestine, the SFK members Src, Fyn and Yes regulate 
epithelial cell proliferation and migration during tissue regeneration and 
transformation, thus implicating conserved and specific functions. In patients 
with colon cancer, SFK activity is a marker of poor clinical prognosis and a 
potent driver of metastasis formation. These tumorigenic activities are linked 
to SFK capacity to promote the dissemination and tumour-initiating capacities of 
epithelial tumour cells. However, it is unclear how SFKs promote colon tumour 
formation and metastatic progression because SFK-encoding genes are unfrequently 
mutated in human cancer. Here, we review recent findings on SFK signalling 
during intestinal homeostasis, regeneration and tumorigenesis. We also describe 
the key nongenetic mechanisms underlying SFK tumour activities in colorectal 
cancer, and discuss how these mechanisms could be exploited in therapeutic 
strategies to target SFK signalling in metastatic colon cancer.
