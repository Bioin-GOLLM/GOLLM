Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with cure and 
durable remission of late-onset primary isolated central nervous system 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Primary isolated CNS presentation of HLH is exceedingly rare and typically 
associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We describe an adolescent 
patient with late-onset, primary isolated CNS HLH and a compound heterozygous 
PRF1 mutation (c50delT (p.L17 fs); c.1229G>C (p.R410P)), not previously reported 
with this phenotype. He was successfully treated with allogeneic HSCT following 
a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, despite a high pre-HSCT comorbidity 
index. Two years after transplant, he is alive and in disease remission. While 
patients with systemic HLH and active CNS disease have relatively poorer 
outcomes, a high index of suspicion may aid with early diagnosis of primary 
isolated CNS HLH; prompt treatment with HSCT may be associated with improved 
cure and durable remission of this rare disease.
