Skin epidermis is an active site of lipid synthesis. The intercellular lipids of 
human stratum corneum (SC) are unique in composition and quite different from 
the lipids found in most biological membranes. The three major lipids in the SC 
are free fatty acids, cholesterol and ceramides. Fatty acids can be synthesized 
by keratinocytes de novo and, in addition, need to be taken up from the 
circulation. The latter process has been shown to be protein mediated, and 
several fatty acid transporters are expressed in skin. Recent studies of 
transgenic and knockout animal models for fatty acid transporters and the 
identification of fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4 or SLC27A4) mutations as 
causative for Ichthyosis Prematurity Syndrome highlight the vital roles of fatty 
acid transport and metabolism in skin homeostasis. This review provides an 
overview of our current understanding of the role of fatty acids and their 
transporters in cutaneous biology, including their involvement in epidermal 
barrier generation and skin inflammation.
