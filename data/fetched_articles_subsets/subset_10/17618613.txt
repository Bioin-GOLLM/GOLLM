BACKGROUND: Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the key enzyme responsible 
for endothelin-1 generation, has been linked to coronary artery disease (CAD). 
Recently, a genetic polymorphism (ECE-1b C-338A) located in ECE-1 gene promoter 
was identified. However, it is unclear whether this polymorphism is associated 
with the risk of CAD.
METHODS: We conducted a study with CAD patients and controls matched by age and 
sex to examine the prevalence of ECE-1b C-338A polymorphism in CAD.
RESULTS: The frequencies of ECE-1b-338CC, CA, and AA genotypes in cases (40.1%, 
42.2%, and 17.7%) were significantly different from those of controls (50.6%, 
40.5%, and 8.9%, chi2=9.989, P=0.007). Subjects with the variant genotypes (CA+ 
AA) had a 58% increased risk of CAD relative to CC carriers (adjusted OR=1.58, 
95% CI=1.07-2.32). Furthermore, the adjusted OR of AA genotype for CAD was 2.33 
(95% CI=1.25-4.35). In stratified analyses, the A allele was significantly 
associated with increased risk of CAD in female (adjusted OR=2.86, 95% 
CI=1.40-5.84) and subjects with age >or= 64 y (adjusted OR=2.96, 95% 
CI=1.73-5.08). Moreover, the frequency of patients with variant genotypes 
increased gradually from single- to triple-vessel disease although without 
statistical significance (P=0.069 for trend).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that ECE-1b-338C to A variant might be 
associated with increased risk of CAD in Chinese population.
