This study explores genomic alterations in cholangiocarcinoma (CCC) tissues in 
Thai patients. We identified and reviewed the records of patients who had been 
diagnosed with CCC and for whom sufficient tumor samples for DNA and RNA 
extraction were available in our database. The specimens were explored for EGFR, 
KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations and ROS1 translocation in 81 samples. 
Immunohistochemistry staining for HER2, ALK, and Ki-67 expression was tested in 
74 samples. Prevalence of EGFR, KRAS, and PIK3CA mutations in this study was 
21%, 12%, and 16%, respectively. No BRAF V600 mutation or ROS1 translocation was 
found. Patients with T790M mutation had a significantly longer overall survival 
(18.84 months) than those with the other types of EGFR mutations (4.08 months; 
hazard ratio [HR]: 0.26, P=0.038) and also had a significantly lower median 
Ki-67 (22.5% vs 80%, P=0.025). Furthermore, patients with PIK3CA mutations had a 
significantly longer median progression-free survival (15.87 vs 7.01 months; HR: 
0.46, P=0.043). Strongly positive HER2 expression was found in only 1 patient, 
whereas ALK expression was not found. The presence of EGFR and/or PIK3CA 
mutations implies that targeted drugs may provide a feasible CCC treatment in 
the future.
