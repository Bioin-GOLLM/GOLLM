According to current models of retrovirus infection, receptor binding to the 
surface subunit (SU) of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) triggers a 
conformational change in the transmembrane subunit (TM) that mediates virus 
fusion to cell membranes. To understand how this occurs, we investigated the 
role of the receptor Tva in avian leukosis virus-A (ALV-A) infection. We find 
that Tva binding induced the formation of a reactive thiolate on Cys38 (Cys38-S- 
in SU. Both chemical and genetic inactivation of Cys38-S- completely abrogated 
ALV fusion and infection. Remarkably, Cys38-S- does not mediate isomerization of 
the SU-TM disulfide bond and is not required for Tva-induced activation of TM, 
including pre-hairpin association with membranes and low pH assembly of helical 
bundles. These findings indicate that, contrary to current models, receptor 
activation of TM is not sufficient for ALV fusion and infection and that 
formation of a reactive thiolate is an additional receptor-dependent step.
