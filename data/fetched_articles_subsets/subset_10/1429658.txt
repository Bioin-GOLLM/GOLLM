We report the expression cloning of pMev, a cDNA that facilitates cellular 
uptake of mevalonate. pMev was isolated from the met-18b-2 clone of Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which were selected for growth in low concentrations 
of mevalonate when synthesis is blocked by compactin (Faust, J. R., and Krieger, 
M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1996-2004). pMev encodes a 494-residue protein, 
Mev, that is predicted to have 12 membrane-spanning regions, consistent with a 
membrane transporter. Surprisingly, levels of Mev mRNA and protein are similar 
in CHO and met-18b-2 cells. The Mev gene differs from the wild-type gene by a 
single base change that substitutes a cysteine for phenylalanine in the 10th 
membrane-spanning region. met-18b-2 cells are heterozygous for this dominant 
gain-of-function mutation. Transfection of a cDNA encoding pMev, but not the 
wild-type cDNA, elicited a marked increase in [3H]mevalonate uptake and 
incorporation into cellular lipids in stably and transiently transfected cells. 
The availability of pMev will facilitate studies of [3H]mevalonate incorporation 
into trace products, including p21ras and other prenylated proteins.
