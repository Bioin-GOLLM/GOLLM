Receptor tyrosine kinases have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for a 
diverse set of tumors. Overactivation of the tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) has been reported in several types of malignancies such as 
anaplastic large cell lymphoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, 
neuroblastoma, and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Further characterization of 
the molecular role of ALK has revealed an oncogenic signaling signature that 
results in tumor dependence on ALK. ALK-positive tumors display a different 
behavior than their ALK-negative counterparts; however, the specific role of ALK 
in some of these tumors remains to be elucidated. Although more studies are 
required to establish selective targeting of ALK as a definitive therapeutic 
option, initial trials have shown extraordinary results in the majority of 
cases.
