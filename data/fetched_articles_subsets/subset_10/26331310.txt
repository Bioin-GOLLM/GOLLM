Austronesian speaking peoples left Southeast Asia and entered the Western 
Pacific c.4000-3000 years ago, continuing on to colonise Remote Oceania for the 
first time, where they became the ancestral populations of Polynesians. 
Understanding the impact of these peoples on the mainland of New Guinea before 
they entered Remote Oceania has eluded archaeologists. New research from the 
archaeological site of Wañelek in the New Guinea Highlands has broken this 
silence. Petrographic and geochemical data from pottery and new radiocarbon 
dating demonstrates that Austronesian influences penetrated into the highland 
interior by 3000 years ago. One potsherd was manufactured along the northeast 
coast of New Guinea, whereas others were manufactured from inland materials. 
These findings represent the oldest securely dated pottery from an 
archaeological context on the island of New Guinea. Additionally, the pottery 
comes from the interior, suggesting the movements of people and technological 
practices, as well as objects at this time. The antiquity of the Wañelek pottery 
is coincident with the expansion of Lapita pottery in the Western Pacific. Such 
occupation also occurs at the same time that changes have been identified in 
subsistence strategies in the archaeological record at Kuk Swamp suggesting a 
possible link between the two.
