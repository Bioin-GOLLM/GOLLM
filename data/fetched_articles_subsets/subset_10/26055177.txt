Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most intractable cancers, with a dismal 
prognosis reflected by a 5-year survival of ~6%. Since early disease symptoms 
are undefined and specific biomarkers are lacking, about 80% of patients present 
with advanced, inoperable tumors that represent a daunting challenge. Despite 
many clinical trials, no single chemotherapy agent has been reliably associated 
with objective response rates above 10% or median survival longer than 5 to 7 
months. Although combination chemotherapy regimens have in recent years provided 
some improvement, overall survival (8-11 months) remains very poor. There is 
therefore a critical need for novel therapies that can improve outcomes for 
pancreatic cancer patients. Here, we present a summary of the current therapies 
used in the management of advanced pancreatic cancer and review novel 
therapeutic strategies that target tumor biomarkers. We also describe our recent 
research using phosphatidylserine-targeted saposin C-coupled 
dioleoylphosphatidylserine nanovesicles for imaging and therapy of pancreatic 
cancer.
