Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) are medicines for human use based on 
genes, cells or tissue engineering. After clear successes in adults, the nascent 
technology now sees increasing pediatric application. For many still untreatable 
disorders with pre- or perinatal onset, timely intervention is simply 
indispensable; thus, prenatal and pediatric applications of ATMPs hold great 
promise for curative treatments. Moreover, for most inherited disorders, early 
ATMP application may substantially improve efficiency, economy and accessibility 
compared with application in adults. Vindicating this notion, initial data for 
cell-based ATMPs show better cell yields, success rates and corrections of 
disease parameters for younger patients, in addition to reduced overall cell and 
vector requirements, illustrating that early application may resolve key 
obstacles to the widespread application of ATMPs for inherited disorders. Here, 
we provide a selective review of the latest ATMP developments for prenatal, 
perinatal and pediatric use, with special emphasis on its comparison with ATMPs 
for adults. Taken together, we provide a perspective on the enormous potential 
and key framework parameters of clinical prenatal and pediatric ATMP 
application.
