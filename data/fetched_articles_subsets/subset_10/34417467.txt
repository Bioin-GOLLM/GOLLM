The contents of numerous membrane lipids change upon ageing. However, it is 
unknown whether and how any of these changes are causally linked to lifespan 
regulation. Acyl chains contribute to the functional specificity of membrane 
lipids. In this study, working with C. elegans, we identified an acyl 
chain-specific sphingolipid, C22 glucosylceramide, as a longevity metabolite. 
Germline deficiency, a conserved lifespan-extending paradigm, induces somatic 
expression of the fatty acid elongase ELO-3, and behenic acid (22:0) generated 
by ELO-3 is incorporated into glucosylceramide for lifespan regulation. 
Mechanistically, C22 glucosylceramide is required for the membrane localization 
of clathrin, a protein that regulates membrane budding. The reduction in C22 
glucosylceramide impairs the clathrin-dependent autophagic lysosome reformation, 
which subsequently leads to TOR activation and longevity suppression. These 
findings reveal a mechanistic link between membrane lipids and ageing and 
suggest a model of lifespan regulation by fatty acid-mediated membrane 
configuration.
