BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is crucial in stroke pathogenesis. Many 
cohort-based studies suggested that the intake of exogenous antioxidants 
originated from food may prevent stroke. However, the corresponding randomized 
controlled trials did not show diet-derived antioxidants have a protective 
effect on stroke.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of genetically proxied diet-derived 
antioxidants with stroke risk using Mendelian randomization.
METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to 
evaluate the causal effect of diet-derived antioxidants on stroke risk. For 
exposure data, we extracted genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) 
that are strongly associated with frequently used diet-derived antioxidants, 
including vitamin C, vitamin E (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol), carotene, retinol, 
zinc, and selenium, from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS). We 
obtained IVs' corresponding effect estimates on the risk of total stroke and 
ischemic stroke from a GWAS meta-analysis with 40,585 cases and 406,111 
controls. Finally, we applied five types of Mendelian randomization analysis to 
obtain preliminary MR results and performed four three kinds of sensitivity 
analysis to verify them.
RESULTS: According to the primary MR estimations and further sensitivity 
analyses, we established two robust associations after Bonferroni correction: 
genetically proxied circulating γ-tocopherol was causally associated with total 
stroke [odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.52-0.88), p = 
3.78E - 03] and ischemic stroke [OR = 0.66, 95% CI (0.51-0.86), p = 2.34E - 03]. 
There was no evidence to support the causal effect of other diet-derived 
antioxidants on the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a protective impact of genetic susceptibility to 
high circulating γ-tocopherol levels on stroke risk, providing new information 
on the potential therapeutic targets for primary stroke prevention.
