Children and adults can have recurrent infection with invasive encapsulated 
bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae as a result of a selective 
inability to respond to polysaccharide antigens. We have identified a mutation 
in the gene encoding Bruton's tyrosine kinase in a male patient with selective 
anti-polysaccharide antibody deficiency.
