PURPOSE: To identify the genetic variants associated with breast cancer 
survival, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted of Korean breast 
cancer patients.
METHODS: From the Seoul Breast Cancer Study (SEBCS), 3,226 patients with breast 
cancer (1,732 in the discovery and 1,494 in the replication set) were included 
in a two-stage GWAS on disease-free survival (DFS) by tumor subtypes based on 
hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The 
associations of the re-classified combined prognostic markers through recursive 
partitioning analysis (RPA) of DFS for breast cancer were assessed with the Cox 
proportional hazard model. The prognostic predictive values of the clinical and 
genetic models were evaluated by Harrell's C.
RESULTS: In the two-stage GWAS stratified by tumor subtypes, rs166870 and 
rs10825036 were consistently associated with DFS in the HR+ HER2- and HR- HER2- 
breast cancer subtypes, respectively (Prs166870 = 2.88 × 10(-7) and Prs10825036 
= 3.54 × 10(-7) in the combined set). When patients were classified by the RPA 
in each subtype, genetic factors contributed significantly to differentiating 
the high risk group associated with DFS inbreast cancer, specifically the HR+ 
HER2- (P discovery=1.18 × 10(-8) and P replication = 2.08 × 10(-5)) and HR- 
HRE2- subtypes (P discovery = 2.35 × 10(-4) and P replication = 2.60 × 10(-2)). 
The inclusion of the SNPs tended to improve the performance of the prognostic 
models consisting of age, TNM stage and tumor subtypes based on ER, PR, and HER2 
status.
CONCLUSION: Combined prognostic markers that include clinical and genetic 
factors by tumor subtypes could improve the prediction of survival in breast 
cancer.
