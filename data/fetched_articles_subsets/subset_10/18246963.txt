BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common non-melanoma skin 
cancer in the Western world. The objective of this study was to examine together 
germline mutations in the TP53, PTCH, and XPD genes as risk factors for 
developing BCC at a young age. We hypothesized that mutations in these genes 
significantly increase the risk of early-onset BCC (< or = 35 years).
METHODS: The PCR, DNA sequencing and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms 
methods were utilized to study eight Puerto Rican patients with a confirmed 
diagnosis of BCC before age 35.
RESULTS: A novel germline mutation (T:A transversion) was identified at the exon 
4, codon 50 of the TP53 gene of one BCC patient. No other mutations were found 
at the TP53 or PTCH genes. The presence of the XPD mutant allele is associated 
with a seven-fold increase in risk (OR = 7.0, p = 0.03) for developing BCC prior 
to age 35. In addition, the DNA Repair Capacity (DRC) of these BCC patients 
showed a 47% reduction that was significant in relation to age-matched controls 
(p = 0.021). However, the XPD mutant allele was not associated with the decrease 
in DRC observed in BCC participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated population presented BCC before age 35, a phenomenon 
that is so rare as to make very difficult the study of this subpopulation with a 
larger sample size. The results of this study, suggest that the XPD Lys751Gln 
polymorphism may have a significant role in the development of early-onset BCC 
in the Puerto Rican population.
