Long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) is a family of gene transcripts, the 
functions of which are largely unknown. Although cigarette smoking is the main 
cause for lung cancer, lung cancer in non-smokers is a separate entity and its 
underlying cause is little known. Growing evidence suggests lincRNAs play a 
significant role in cancer development and progression; however, such data is 
lacking for lung cancer in non-smokers, or those who have never smoked. This 
study conducted comprehensive profiling of lincRNAs from RNA sequencing 
(RNA-seq) data of non-smoker patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Both known and 
novel lincRNAs distinctly segregated tumors from normal tissues. Approximately 
one third of lincRNAs were differentially expressed between tumors and normal 
samples and most of them were coordinated with their putative protein gene 
targets. More importantly, lincRNAs defined two clusters of tumors that were 
associated with tumor aggressiveness and patient survival. We identified a 
subset of lincRNAs that were differentially expressed and also associated with 
patient survival. Very high concordance (RÂ² = 0.9) was observed for the 
differentially expressed lincRNAs in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) validation 
set of 85 transcriptomes and the lincRNAs associated with survival from the 
discovery set were similarly predictive in the validation set. These lincRNAs 
warrant further investigation as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers.
