The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway is thought to play an important 
role in brain development. Altered levels of IGFs and their signaling regulators 
have been shown in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. In this study, we 
investigated whether coding region single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) of 
the insulin receptor substrates (IRS1 and IRS2), key mediators of the IGF 
pathway, were associated with ASD in Korean males. Two cSNPs (rs1801123 of IRS1, 
and rs4773092 of IRS2) were genotyped using direct sequencing in 180 male ASD 
patients and 147 male control subjects. A significant association between 
rs1801123 of IRS1 and ASD was shown in additive (p = 0.022, odds ratio (OR) = 
0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.46-0.95) and dominant models (p = 0.013, 
OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.37-0.89). Allele frequency analysis also showed an 
association between rs1801123 and ASD (p = 0.022, OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 
0.46-0.94). These results suggest that IRS1 may contribute to the susceptibility 
of ASD in Korean males.
