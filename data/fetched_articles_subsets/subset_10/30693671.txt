BACKGROUND: Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 
(TRPV4) is an ion channel permeable to Ca2+ that is sensitive to physical, 
hormonal, and chemical stimuli. This protein is expressed in many cell types, 
including osteoclasts, chondrocytes, and sensory neurons. As such, pathogenic 
variants of this gene are associated with skeletal dysplasias and neuromuscular 
disorders. Pathogenesis of these phenotypes is not yet completely understood, 
but it is known that genotype-phenotype correlations for TRPV4 pathogenic 
variants often are not present.
METHODS: Newly characterized, suspected pathogenic variant in TRPV4 was analyzed 
using protein informatics and personalized protein-level molecular studies, 
genomic exome analysis, and clinical study.
RESULTS: This statement is demonstrated in the family of our proband, a 
47-year-old female having the novel c.2401A>G (p.K801E) variant of TRPV4. We 
discuss the common symptoms between the proband, her father, and her daughter, 
and compare her phenotype to known TRPV4-associated skeletal dysplasias.
CONCLUSIONS: Protein informatics and molecular modeling are used to confirm the 
pathogenicity of the unique TRPV4 variant found in this family. Multiple data 
were combined in a comprehensive manner to give complete overall perspective on 
the patient disease and prognosis.
