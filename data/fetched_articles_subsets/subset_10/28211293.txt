BACKGROUND: Hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations have a role in iron 
overload in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. We aimed to 
evaluate the genotype frequency and allelic distribution of the two HFE gene 
mutations (C282Y and H63D) in a sample of Egyptian pediatric ALL survivors and 
to detect the impact of these two mutations on their iron profile.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was performed on 35 ALL survivors during their 
follow-up visits to the Hematology and Oncology Unit, Pediatric Department, 
Menoufia University Hospitals. Thirty-five healthy children of matched age and 
sex were chosen as controls. After completing treatment course, ALL survivors 
were screened for the prevalence of these two mutations by polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Serum ferritin levels were 
measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique (ELISA).
RESULTS: C282Y mutation cannot be detected in any of the 35 survivors or the 35 
controls. The H63D heterozygous state (CG) was detected in 28.6% of the 
survivors group and in 20% of controls, while the H63D homozygous (GG) state was 
detected in 17.1% of survivors. No compound heterozygosity (C282Y/H63D) was 
detected at both groups with high G allele frequency (31.4%) in survivors more 
than controls (10%). There were significant higher levels of iron parameters in 
homozygote survivors than heterozygotes and the controls.
CONCLUSION: H63D mutation aggravates the iron overload status in pediatric ALL 
survivors.
