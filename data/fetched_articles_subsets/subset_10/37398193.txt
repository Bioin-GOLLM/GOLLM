Transcription factors (TFs) can define distinct cellular identities despite 
nearly identical DNA-binding specificities. One mechanism for achieving 
regulatory specificity is DNA-guided TF cooperativity. Although in vitro studies 
suggest it may be common, examples of such cooperativity remain scarce in 
cellular contexts. Here, we demonstrate how 'Coordinator', a long DNA motif 
comprised of common motifs bound by many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and 
homeodomain (HD) TFs, uniquely defines regulatory regions of embryonic face and 
limb mesenchyme. Coordinator guides cooperative and selective binding between 
the bHLH family mesenchymal regulator TWIST1 and a collective of HD factors 
associated with regional identities in the face and limb. TWIST1 is required for 
HD binding and open chromatin at Coordinator sites, while HD factors stabilize 
TWIST1 occupancy at Coordinator and titrate it away from HD-independent sites. 
This cooperativity results in shared regulation of genes involved in cell-type 
and positional identities, and ultimately shapes facial morphology and 
evolution.
