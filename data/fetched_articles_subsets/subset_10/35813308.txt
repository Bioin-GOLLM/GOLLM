This study presents a multi-layer fuzzy-based decision-making approach to 
enhance the hospital Circular Supply Chain (CSC) performance by focusing on 
intensive care units (ICU) via key performance indicators analysis. In this 
regard, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and Institution Fuzzy Delphi (IFD) 
are employed to extract the relevant and prominent KPIs. After, a hybrid Fuzzy 
Cognitive Mapping (FCM) and Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation 
Laboratory (FDEMATEL) have been applied to illustrate a conceptual framework for 
the CSC performance management of the healthcare sector in the emerging economy 
of Iran. As a result, eight critical indicators emanated from the SLR-IFD 
approach. Furthermore, sixteen relationships amongst the performance indicators 
were identified via hybrid FCM-FDEMATEL. Inventory availability, information 
availability, innovation, and technology were selected as the most influential 
indicators. Besides, changing the information technology category, including 
information availability and Innovation and technology, had the most impact on 
the performance of the entire CSC. This study attempts to evaluate hospitals' 
circular supply chain performance, by designing the circular evaluation 
framework. Hospital managers can use the results of this research to improve 
their internal circular supply chain performances in the intensive care units by 
understanding the different scenarios.
