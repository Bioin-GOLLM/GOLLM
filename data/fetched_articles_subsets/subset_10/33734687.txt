Recent advances in genome engineering have expanded our capabilities to study 
proteins in their natural states. In particular, the ease and scalability of 
knocking-in small peptide tags has enabled high throughput tagging and analysis 
of endogenous proteins. To improve enrichment capacities and expand the 
functionality of knock-ins using short tags, we developed the tag-assisted split 
enzyme complementation (TASEC) approach, which uses two orthogonal small peptide 
tags and their cognate binders to conditionally drive complementation of a split 
enzyme upon labeled protein expression. Using this approach, we have engineered 
and optimized the tag-assisted split HaloTag complementation system 
(TA-splitHalo) and demonstrated its versatile applications in improving the 
efficiency of knock-in cell enrichment, detection of protein-protein 
interaction, and isolation of biallelic gene edited cells through multiplexing.
