Enzyme immobilization is a technology that enables (bio-)catalysts to be applied 
in continuous-flow systems. However, there is a plethora of immobilization 
methods available with individual advantages and disadvantages. Here, we 
assessed the influence of simple and readily available methods with respect to 
the performance of 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) in 
continuous-flow conditions. The investigated immobilization strategies cover the 
unspecific attachment to carriers via epoxides, affinity-based attachment via 
metal ion affinity, StrepTag™-StrepTactin™ interaction as well as the covalent 
affinity attachment of an enzyme to a matrix tethered by the HaloTag®. The 
metal-ion-affinity-based approach outperformed the other methods in terms of 
immobilized activity and stability under applied conditions. As most enzymes 
examined today already have a HisTag for purification purposes, effective 
immobilization may be applied, as simple as a standard purification, if needed.
