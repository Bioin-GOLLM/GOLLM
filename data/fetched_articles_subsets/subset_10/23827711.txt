MicroRNAs are frequently deregulated in cancer. Here we show that miR-22 is 
upregulated in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia and its aberrant 
expression correlates with poor survival. To explore its role in hematopoietic 
stem cell function and malignancy, we generated transgenic mice conditionally 
expressing miR-22 in the hematopoietic compartment. These mice displayed reduced 
levels of global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and increased hematopoietic 
stem cell self-renewal accompanied by defective differentiation. Conversely, 
miR-22 inhibition blocked proliferation in both mouse and human leukemic cells. 
Over time, miR-22 transgenic mice developed MDS and hematological malignancies. 
We also identify TET2 as a key target of miR-22 in this context. Ectopic 
expression of TET2 suppressed the miR-22-induced phenotypes. Downregulation of 
TET2 protein also correlated with poor clinical outcomes and miR-22 
overexpression in MDS patients. Our results therefore identify miR-22 as a 
potent proto-oncogene and suggest that aberrations in the miR-22/TET2 regulatory 
network are common in hematopoietic malignancies.
