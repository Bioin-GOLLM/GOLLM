Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who exhibit elevated 
blood eosinophil levels often experience worsened lung function and more severe 
emphysema. This implies the potential involvement of eosinophils in the 
development of emphysema. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the 
development of eosinophil-mediated emphysema remain unclear. In this study, we 
employed single-cell RNA sequencing to identify eosinophil subgroups in mouse 
models of asthma and emphysema, followed by functional analyses of these 
subgroups. Assessment of accumulated eosinophils unveiled distinct 
transcriptomes in the lungs of mice with elastase-induced emphysema and 
ovalbumin-induced asthma. Depletion of eosinophils through the use of 
anti-interleukin-5 antibodies ameliorated elastase-induced emphysema. A 
particularly noteworthy discovery is that eosinophil-derived cathepsin L 
contributed to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, thereby leading to 
emphysema in pulmonary tissue. Inhibition of cathepsin L resulted in a reduction 
of elastase-induced emphysema in a mouse model. Importantly, eosinophil levels 
correlated positively with serum cathepsin L levels, which were higher in 
emphysema patients than those without emphysema. Expression of cathepsin L in 
eosinophils demonstrated a direct association with lung emphysema in COPD 
patients. Collectively, these findings underscore the significant role of 
eosinophil-derived cathepsin L in extracellular matrix degradation and 
remodeling, and its relevance to emphysema in COPD patients. Consequently, 
targeting eosinophil-derived cathepsin L could potentially offer a therapeutic 
avenue for emphysema patients. Further investigations are warranted to explore 
therapeutic strategies targeting cathepsin L in emphysema patients.
