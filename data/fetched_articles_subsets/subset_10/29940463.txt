A series of novel selective BRAFV600E inhibitory agents (Compound 1-16) 
5-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxane-6-yl)-N,3-diaryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamides 
have been designed and synthesized. Their anti-proliferation and BRAF inhibitory 
activities were evaluated. Though 15, 4 and 12 all displayed comparable activity 
with the positive control Vemurafenib, only 12 indicated fine selectivity on 
BRAFV600E (IC50 = 0.06 μM for BRAFV600E; GI50 = 0.52 μM for A375) over BRAFWT at 
both kinase and cell levels. This result satisfied the designing concept of 
improving activity and introducing selectivity. Flow cytometry analysis and 
western blot convinced the apoptosis induction and kinase inhibitory activity. 
Docking simulation inferred the differences in binding patterns of BRAFV600E and 
BRAFWT, pointing out that the future orientation might be seeking for outer 
space binding of BRAFV600E and avoiding interactions with HIS573 of BRAFWT. 
These results brought potent BRAF inhibitors one step further to selective 
agents, enhancing the potential for safe medication.
