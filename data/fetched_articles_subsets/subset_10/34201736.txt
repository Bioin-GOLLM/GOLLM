Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most frequent hereditary peripheral 
neuropathies. It is subdivided in two main groups, demyelinating (CMT1) and 
axonal (CMT2). CMT1 forms are the most frequent. The goal of this review is to 
present published data on 1-cellular and animal models having opened new 
potential therapeutic approaches. 2-exploration of these tracks, including 
clinical trials. The first conclusion is the great increase of publications on 
CMT1 subtypes since 2000. We discussed two points that should be considered in 
the therapeutic development toward a regulatory-approved therapy to be proposed 
to patients. The first point concerns long term safety if treatments will be a 
long-term process. The second point relates to the evaluation of treatment 
efficiency. Degradation of CMT clinical phenotype is not linear and progressive.
