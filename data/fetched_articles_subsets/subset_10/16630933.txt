BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been suggested to be a 
key mediator in the development of atopy and T(H)2 inflammation.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the effects of variations in the gene coding 
VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 2 on intermediate phenotypes of asthma in the Korean 
population.
METHODS: A cohort of 2055 children and adolescents responded to a questionnaire 
concerning asthma symptoms and risk factors and underwent methacholine bronchial 
challenge and skin tests. The VEGFR2 gene, including the promoter area, was 
sequenced on 24 healthy subjects to discover informative single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs; minor allele frequency >2%). After haplotype 
reconstruction, 4 tagging SNPs (IVS6+54A>G, +889G>A, +1416T>A, and IVS25-92G>A) 
were scored. These SNPs were also scored in 480 adult asthmatic patients to 
verify the above genetic association study.
RESULTS: The prevalence of atopy was associated with a single SNP (+889G>A) of 
VEGFR2 with borderline significance (P = .048; relative risk, 1.13; 95% CI, 
1.00-1.28). However, haplotype analysis showed that the atopy prevalence was 
strongly associated with a haplotype (AGAG) of VEGFR2 (P = .002; relative risk, 
1.25; 95% CI, 1.09-1.42). As for airway hyperresponsiveness, neither individual 
SNPs nor haplotypes were found to be associated. Interestingly, the significant 
association was also found between atopy and the AGAG haplotype among adult 
asthmatic patients (P = .008; odds ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.14-2.44).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that genetic variations of VEGFR2 
are significantly associated with atopy in the Korean population.
