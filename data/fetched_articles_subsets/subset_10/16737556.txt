Serpins are a broadly distributed family of protease inhibitors that use a 
conformational change to inhibit target enzymes. They are central in controlling 
many important proteolytic cascades, including the mammalian coagulation 
pathways. Serpins are conformationally labile and many of the disease-linked 
mutations of serpins result in misfolding or in pathogenic, inactive polymers.
