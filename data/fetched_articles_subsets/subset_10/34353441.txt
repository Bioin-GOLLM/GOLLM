Cisplatin has been a mainstay of cancer chemotherapy since the 1970s. Despite 
its broad anticancer potential, its clinical use has regularly been constrained 
by kidney toxicities. This review details those biochemical pathways and 
metabolic conversions that underlie the kidney toxicities. A wide range of redox 
events contribute to the eventual physiological consequences of drug activities.
