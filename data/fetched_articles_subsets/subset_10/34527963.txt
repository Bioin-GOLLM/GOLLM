Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are pleomorphic regulators of eukaryotic 
cellular responses to extracellular signals that function by modulating the 
phosphotyrosine of specific proteins. A handful of PTPs have been implicated in 
germline and somatic human disease. Using exome sequencing, we identified 
missense and truncating variants in PTPN4 in six unrelated individuals with 
varying degrees of intellectual disability or developmental delay. The variants 
occurred de novo in all five subjects in whom segregation analysis was possible. 
Recurring features include postnatal growth deficiency or excess, seizures, and, 
less commonly, structural CNS, heart, or skeletal anomalies. PTPN4 is a widely 
expressed protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates neuronal cell homeostasis 
by protecting neurons against apoptosis. We suggest that pathogenic variants in 
PTPN4 confer risk for growth and cognitive abnormalities in humans.
