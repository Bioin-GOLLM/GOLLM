BACKGROUND: A universal coverage campaign (UCC) with long-lasting insecticidal 
nets (LLINs) was implemented in four districts in Midwestern Uganda in 
2009-2010. Entomological surveys were carried out to monitor changes in vector 
density, behaviour and malaria transmission following this intervention.
METHODS: Anopheles mosquitoes were collected using CDC light traps quarterly and 
human landing catch twice a year in four sites. Collections were done at 
baseline before the campaign and over a three-year period following the 
campaign. Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays were performed. A subset of anophelines were molecularly identified to 
species, and kdr L1014S frequencies were determined.
RESULTS: The prevailing malaria vector in three sites was Anopheles gambiae s.l. 
(>97 %), with An. funestus s.l. being present in low numbers only. An. gambiae 
s.s. dominated (> 95 %) over An. arabiensis within A. gambiae s.l. In the 
remaining site, all three vector species were observed, although their relative 
densities varied among seasons and years. Vector densities were low in the year 
following the UCC but increased over time. Vector infectivity was 3.2 % at 
baseline and 1.8 % three years post-distribution (p = 0.001). The daily 
entomological inoculation rate (EIR) in 2012 varied between 0.0-0.98 for the 
different sites compared to a baseline EIR that was between 0.0-5.8 in 2009. 
There was no indication of a change in indoor feeding times, and both An. 
gambiae s.l. and An. funestus s.l. continued to feed primarily after midnight 
with vectors being active until the early morning. Kdr L1014S frequencies were 
already high at baseline (53-85 %) but increased significantly in all sites over 
time.
CONCLUSIONS: The entomological surveys indicate that there was a reduction in 
transmission intensity coinciding with an increase in use of LLINs and other 
antimalarial interventions in areas of high malaria transmission. There was no 
change in feeding behaviour, and human-vector contact occurred indoors and 
primarily after midnight constantly throughout the study. Although the study was 
not designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention compared to areas 
with no such intervention, the reduction in transmission occurred in an area 
with previously stable malaria, which seems to indicate a substantial 
contribution of the increased LLIN coverage.
