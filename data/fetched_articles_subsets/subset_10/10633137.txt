Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disorder limited almost 
exclusively to women of reproductive age. LAM affects about 5% of women with 
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). LAM also occurs in women who do not have TSC 
(sporadic LAM). TSC is a tumour suppressor gene syndrome characterised by 
seizures, mental retardation, and tumours in the brain, heart, and kidney. 
Angiomyolipomas, which are benign tumours with smooth muscle, fat, and 
dysplastic vascular components, are the most common renal tumour in TSC. Renal 
angiomyolipomas also occur in 63% of sporadic LAM patients. We recently found 
that 54% of these angiomyolipomas have TSC2 loss of heterozygosity, leading to 
the hypothesis that sporadic LAM is genetically related to TSC. In this study, 
we screened DNA from 21 women with sporadic LAM for mutations in all 41 exons of 
TSC2. Twelve of the patients had known renal angiomyolipomas. No TSC2 mutations 
were detected. We did find three silent TSC2 polymorphisms. We conclude that 
patients with sporadic LAM, including those with renal angiomyolipomas, do not 
have a high frequency of germline mutations in the coding region of TSC2.
