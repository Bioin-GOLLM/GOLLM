We describe a case of a 22-year-old man who presented with clinical features of 
atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome and in whom genetic analysis of complement 
regulatory proteins demonstrated a CD46 mutation. He was treated with plasma 
exchange, intermittent haemodialysis and blood transfusions. At 6-month 
follow-up his haematological parameters and renal function showed complete 
resolution, and he experienced no further disease recurrence in the subsequent 
year.
