Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a complex neuromuscular disease caused by an 
unstable cardiotocography (CTG) repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. This disease 
is characterized by high clinical and genetic variability, leading to some 
difficulties in the diagnosis and prognosis of DM1. Better understanding the 
origin of this variability is important for developing new challenging therapies 
and, in particular, for progressing on the path of personalized treatments. 
Here, we reviewed CTG triplet repeat instability and its modifiers as an 
important source of phenotypic variability in patients with DM1.
