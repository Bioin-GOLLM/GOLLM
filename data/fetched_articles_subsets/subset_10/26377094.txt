BACKGROUND: Multiple studies in various parts of the world have analysed the 
association of nutritional status on malaria using anthropometric measures, but 
results differ due to the heterogeneity of the study population, species of the 
parasite, and other factors involved in the host and parasite relationship. The 
aim of this study was to perform a systematic review on the inter-relationship 
of nutritional status based on anthropometry and malarial infection.
METHODS: Two independent reviewers accessed the MEDLINE and LILACS databases 
using the same search terms related to malaria and anthropometry. Prospective 
studies associating anthropometry and malaria (incidence or severity) were 
selected. References from the included studies and reviews were used to increase 
the review sensitivity. Data were extracted using a standardized form and the 
quality of the prospective studies was assessed. Selected articles were grouped 
based on exposures and outcomes.
RESULTS: The search identified a total of 1688 studies: 1629 from MEDLINE and 59 
from LILACS. A total of 23 met the inclusion criteria. Five additional studies 
were detected by reading the references of the 23 included studies and reviews, 
totaling 28 studies included. The mean sample size was 662.1 people, ranging 
from 57 to 5620. The mean follow-up was 365.8 days, ranging from 14 days to 
1 year and 9 months, and nine studies did not report the follow-up period. 
Prospective studies assessing the relationship between malaria and malnutrition 
were mostly carried out in Africa. Of the 20 studies with malarial outcomes, 
fifteen had high and five had average quality, with an average score of 80.5 %. 
Most anthropometric parameters had no association with malaria incidence (47/52; 
90.4 %) or parasite density (20/25; 80 %). However, the impact of malnutrition 
was noted in malaria mortality and severity (7/17; 41.2 %). Regarding the 
effects of malaria on malnutrition, malaria was associated with very few 
anthropometric parameters (8/39; 20.6 %).
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found that most of the evidence associating 
malaria and malnutrition comes from P. falciparum endemic areas, with a 
significant heterogeneity in studies' design. Apparently malnutrition has not a 
great impact on malaria morbidity, but could have a negative impact on malaria 
mortality and severity. Most studies show no association between malaria and 
subsequent malnutrition in P. falciparum areas. In Plasmodium vivax endemic 
areas, malaria was associated with malnutrition in children. A discussion among 
experts in the field is needed to standardize future studies to increase 
external validity and accuracy.
