Generalized vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder characterized by patchy loss of 
pigmentation due to autoimmune destruction of melanocytes in the involved areas. 
Vitiligo is a polygenic, multifactorial disorder involving multiple genes and 
unknown environmental triggers. Recently, genetic variation in NALP1 (also 
called NLRP1), encoding a key regulator of the innate immune response, has been 
associated with generalized vitiligo in Caucasians of northern European origin. 
Here, we have investigated whether NALP1 is also associated with generalized 
vitiligo in Jordanian Arab patients. We genotyped 8 NALP1 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in 26 generalized vitiligo patients and 61 matched controls 
unaffected by vitiligo or any other autoimmune disorder. We found that two SNPs 
in the NALP1 extended promoter region, rs1008588 and rs2670660 were 
significantly associated with generalized vitiligo in our cohort of Arab 
vitiligo patients, and several other SNPs in the NALP1 region were at the margin 
of significant association. These results indicate that NALP1 is associated with 
susceptibility to generalized vitiligo in Arabs, as in Caucasians. Whether the 
casual variants are the same of not is yet to be identified by functional 
analysis.
