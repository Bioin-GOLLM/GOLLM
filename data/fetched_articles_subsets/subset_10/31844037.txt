BACKGROUND Because of the supply shortage for homologous vein allografts, we 
previously used ringed Gore-Tex vascular grafts for middle hepatic vein (MHV) 
reconstruction in living donor liver transplantation. However, owing to the 
subsequent unavailability of ringed Gore-Tex grafts, we replaced them with 
Hemashield vascular grafts. This study aimed to compare the patency of 
Hemashield grafts with that of ringed Gore-Tex grafts. MATERIAL AND METHODS This 
was a retrospective double-arm study between the study group that used 
Hemashield grafts (n=63) and the historical control group that used ringed 
Gore-Tex grafts (n=126). RESULTS In the Gore-Tex and Hemashield groups, mean age 
was 53.1±6.2 and 54.3±10.4 years; model for end-stage liver disease score was 
16.5±8.3 and 17.5±9.9; and graft-recipient weight ratio was 1.11±0.23 and 
1.12±0.25, respectively. In the Gore-Tex graft group, V5 reconstruction was done 
in single (n=107, 84.9%), double (n=17, 13.5%), and none (n=2, 1.6%). V8 
reconstruction was done in single (n=95, 75.4%), double (n=1, 0.8%), and none 
(n=30, 23.8%). In the Hemashield group, V5 reconstruction was done in single 
(n=43, 68.3%), double (n=19, 30.2%), and triple (n=1, 1.6%). V8 reconstruction 
was done in single (n=45, 71.4%), double (n=9, 14.3%), and none (n=9, 14.3%). 
One-year conduit patency rates in the Gore-Tex and Hemashield groups were 54.8% 
and 71.6%, respectively (p=0.048). CONCLUSIONS MHV reconstruction using 
Hemashield vascular grafts demonstrated higher short-term patency rates than 
those associated with ringed Gore-Tex vascular grafts. We suggest that the 
Hemashield vascular graft is one of the best prosthetic materials for MHV 
reconstruction.
