BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones are indispensable for organ development and 
maintaining homeostasis. Thyroid diseases, including thyroiditis and thyroid 
cancer, affect the normal secretion of hormones and result in thyroid 
dysfunction.
OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on therapeutic applications of stem cells for 
thyroid diseases.
METHODS: A literature search of Medline and PubMed was conducted (January 
2000-July 2021) to identify recent reports on stem cell therapy for thyroid 
diseases.
RESULTS: Stem cells are partially developed cell types. They have the capacity 
to form specialized cells. Besides embryonic stem cells and mesenchymal stem 
cells, organ resident stem cells and cancer stem cells are recently reported to 
have important roles in forming organ specific cells and cancers. Stem cells, 
especially mesenchymal stem cells, have anti-inflammatory and anticancer 
functions as well.
CONCLUSIONS: This review outlines the therapeutic potency of embryonic stem 
cells, mesenchymal stem cells, thyroid resident stem cells, and thyroid cancer 
stem cells in thyroid cells' regeneration, thyroid function modulation, 
thyroiditis suppression, and antithyroid cancers. Stem cells represent a 
promising form of treatment for thyroid disorders.
