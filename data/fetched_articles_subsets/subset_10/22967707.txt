The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of G870A gene 
polymorphism of CCND1 on the formation and behavioral features of prolactinomas. 
One hundred and thirteen patients with prolactinoma and 108 age and gender 
matched control were included in the study. The patients were divided into two 
groups as noninvasive and invasive tumors. CCND1 G870A gene polymorphism was 
compared in patients/control and invasive/noninvasive groups. A and G allele 
frequencies were found as 41.7% and 58.3% in the controls, and 61.1% and 38.9% 
in the patients (p<0.01). Rates of G/G, G/A and A/A genotypes were found as 
11.8%, 55.9% and 32.4% in the noninvasive group, and 15.6%, 44.4% and 40.0% in 
the invasive group, respectively. Differences between patient and control groups 
were significant but were not between invasive and noninvasive groups in terms 
of the allele frequencies and genotype distribution. Mean tumor size and serum 
levels of prolactin at the time of diagnosis and change in these values after 
the treatment were not found statistically significant in genotype subgroups. 
CCND1 G870A gene polymorphism may be an important factor in the early stages of 
the tumor formation. However, it did not affect the features of the tumor.
