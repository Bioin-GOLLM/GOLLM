The molecular basis for ultraviolet (UV) light-induced nonmelanoma and melanoma 
skin cancers centers on cumulative genomic instability caused by inefficient DNA 
repair of dipyrimidine photoproducts. Inefficient DNA repair and subsequent 
translesion replication past these DNA lesions generate distinct molecular 
signatures of tandem CC to TT and C to T transitions at dipyrimidine sites. 
Since previous efforts to develop experimental strategies to enhance the repair 
capacity of basal keratinocytes have been limited, we have engineered the 
N-terminally truncated form (Î”228) UV endonuclease (UVDE) from 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe to include a TAT cell-penetrating peptide sequence 
with or without a nuclear localization signal (NLS): UVDE-TAT and UVDE-NLS-TAT. 
Further, a NLS was engineered onto a pyrimidine dimer glycosylase from 
Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1 (cv-pdg-NLS). Purified enzymes were 
encapsulated into liposomes and topically delivered to the dorsal surface of 
SKH1 hairless mice in a UVB-induced carcinogenesis study. Total tumor burden was 
significantly reduced in mice receiving either UVDE-TAT or UVDE-NLS-TAT versus 
control empty liposomes and time to death was significantly reduced with the 
UVDE-NLS-TAT. These data suggest that efficient delivery of exogenous enzymes 
for the initiation of repair of UVB-induced DNA damage may protect from UVB 
induction of squamous and basal cell carcinomas.
