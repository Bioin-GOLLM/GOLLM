CLC secondary active transporters exchange Cl(-) for H(+). Crystal structures 
have suggested that the conformational change from occluded to outward-facing 
states is unusually simple, involving only the rotation of a conserved glutamate 
(Gluex) upon its protonation. Using (19)F NMR, we show that as [H(+)] is 
increased to protonate Gluex and enrich the outward-facing state, a residue ~20 
Ã… away from Gluex, near the subunit interface, moves from buried to 
solvent-exposed. Consistent with functional relevance of this motion, 
constriction via inter-subunit cross-linking reduces transport. Molecular 
dynamics simulations indicate that the cross-link dampens extracellular 
gate-opening motions. In support of this model, mutations that decrease steric 
contact between Helix N (part of the extracellular gate) and Helix P (at the 
subunit interface) remove the inhibitory effect of the cross-link. Together, 
these results demonstrate the formation of a previously uncharacterized 
'outward-facing open' state, and highlight the relevance of global structural 
changes in CLC function.
