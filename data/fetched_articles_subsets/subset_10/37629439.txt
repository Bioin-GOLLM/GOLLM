Krukenberg tumors are metastatic tumors of the ovaries, associated with poor 
outcomes. Most commonly, these tumors are of gastric origin. The diagnosis of 
Krukenberg tumors in pregnant patients is extremely rare and poses specific 
difficulties for clinicians. We report a case of a pregnant woman presenting 
with an unknown abdominal tumor. Through the use of magnetic resonance imaging, 
multiple differential diagnoses were proposed, including a malignant ovarian 
tumor. A cesarean section and explorative laparotomy were conducted, revealing 
Krukenberg metastases of a gastric tumor, discovered during intraoperative 
gastroscopy. Tumor resection with concomitant chemotherapy was conducted. The 
main aim of this paper was to evaluate whether earlier diagnosis seems possible 
in such cases. A thorough literature review was conducted, unfortunately 
revealing no reliable method for early detection. Furthermore, no consensus 
regarding diagnostics or therapy exists to date. Thus, more research should be 
conducted regarding this rare condition to offer recommendations regarding early 
detection, diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches.
