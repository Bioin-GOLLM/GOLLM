The plasminogen (Plg) protein is the inactive proenzyme form of plasmin that 
dissolves fibrin thrombi by a process called fibrinolysis. It has been shown 
that homozygous or compound-heterozygous deficiency of this protein is a major 
cause of a rare inflammatory disease affecting mainly mucous membranes found in 
different body sites. In this study, five individual Turkish patients and nine 
Turkish families with type 1 Plg deficiency were investigated for PLG gene 
mutations. All of the coding regions of the PLG gene mutations were screened for 
mutations using denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Samples 
showing a different DHPLC profile were subjected to DNA sequencing analysis. 
Here, we described five novel mutations namely, Cys49Ter, +1 IVS6 G>A, 
Gly218Val, Tyr283Cys, and Gly703Asp. Previously identified five nonsynonymous 
(Lys38Glu, Glu180Lys, Gly420Asp, Asp453Asn, Pro763Ser), five synonymous (330 
C>T, 582 C>T, 771 T>C, 1083 A>G, 2286 T>G), and a 3' untranslated region (3' 
UTR) mutation (c.*45 A>G) were also reported in this present study. In this 
study, we have identified a total of eight mutations, five of which are novel. 
The mutations/polymorphisms identified in eight of the patients do not explain 
the disease phenotype. These cases probably carry other pathological mutations 
(homozygous or compound heterozygous) that cannot be detected by DHPLC.
