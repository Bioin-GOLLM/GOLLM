ABSTRACTPURPOSE: Systemic, immune, and target therapies are growing in use in 
the management of metastatic cancers. The aim of this review was to describe 
up-to-date published data on the safety and tolerability of metastasis-directed 
hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT) when combined with newer systemic, 
immune, and targeted therapies and to provide suggested strategies to mitigate 
potential toxicities in the clinical setting.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comprehensive search was performed for the time period 
between 1946 and August 2021 using predetermined keywords describing the use of 
noncentral nervous system palliative RT with commonly used targeted systemic 
therapies on PubMed and Medline databases. A total of 1022 articles were 
screened, and 130 met prespecified criteria to be included in this review.
RESULTS: BRAF and MEK inhibitors are reported to be toxic when given 
concurrently with RT; suspension 3 days and 1 to 2 days, respectively, prior and 
post-RT is suggested. Cetuximab, erlotinib/gefitinib, and osimertinib were 
generally safe to use concomitantly with conventional radiation. But in a 
palliative/hypofractionated RT setting, suspending cetuximab during radiation 
week, erlotinib/gefitinib 1 to 2 days, and osimertinib ≥2 days pre- and post-RT 
is suggested. Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors such as bevacizumab 
reported substantial toxicities, and the suggestion is to suspend 4 weeks before 
and after radiation. Less data exist on sorafenib and sunitinib; 5 to 10 days 
suspension before and after RT should be considered. As a precaution, until 
further data are available, for cyclin-dependent kinase 4-6 inhibitors, 
consideration of suspending treatment 1 to 2 days before and after RT should be 
given. Ipilimumab should be suspended 2 days before and after RT, and 
insufficient data exist for other immunotherapy agents. Trastuzumab and 
pertuzumab are generally safe to use in combination with RT, but insufficient 
data exist for other HER2 target therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Suggested approaches are described, using up-to-date literature, to 
aid clinicians in navigating the integration of newer targeted agents with 
hypofractionated palliative and/or ablative metastatic RT. Further prospective 
studies are required.
