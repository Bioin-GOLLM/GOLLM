Genome association studies in human and genetic studies in mouse implicated 
members of the transmembrane protein 132 (TMEM132) family in multiple conditions 
including panic disorder, hearing loss, limb and kidney malformation. However, 
the presence of five TMEM132 paralogs in mammalian genomes makes it extremely 
challenging to reveal the full requirement for these proteins in vivo. In 
contrast, there is only one TMEM132 homolog, detonator (dtn), in the genome of 
fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, enabling straightforward research into its in 
vivo function. In the current study, we generate multiple loss-of-function dtn 
mutant fly strains through a polycistronic tRNA-gRNA approach, and show that 
most embryos lacking both maternal and paternal dtn fail to hatch into larvae, 
indicating an essential role of dtn in Drosophila reproduction.
