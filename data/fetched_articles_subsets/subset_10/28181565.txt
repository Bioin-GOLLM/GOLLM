Many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with lung 
cancer but lack confirmation and functional characterization. We retested the 
association of 56 candidate SNPs with lung adenocarcinoma risk and overall 
survival in a cohort of 823 Italian patients and 779 healthy controls, and 
assessed their function as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). In the 
replication study, eight SNPs (rs401681, rs3019885, rs732765, rs2568494, 
rs16969968, rs6495309, rs11634351, and rs4105144) associated with lung 
adenocarcinoma risk and three (rs9557635, rs4105144, and rs735482) associated 
with survival. Five of these SNPs acted as cis-eQTLs, being associated with the 
transcription of IREB2 (rs2568494, rs16969968, rs11634351, rs6495309), PSMA4 
(rs6495309) and ERCC1 (rs735482), out of 10,821 genes analyzed in lung. For 
these three genes, we obtained experimental evidence of differential allelic 
expression in lung tissue, pointing to the existence of in-cis genomic variants 
that regulate their transcription. These results suggest that these SNPs exert 
their effects on cancer risk/outcome through the modulation of mRNA levels of 
their target genes.
