YKL-40, a secreted glycoprotein, may serve as an autoantigen, which mediates 
multiple inflammatory diseases and cancers. A high YKL-40 serum level is 
correlated with metastasis and poor survival in a variety of human cancers. 
However, the role of YKL-40 in dogs is still under evaluation. Herein, we 
examined the associations between plasma YKL-40 level and YKL-40 autoantibody 
(YAA) titers with malignancy and prognosis in canine cancer. Plasma levels of 
YKL-40 in healthy dogs (n = 20) and in dogs (n = 82) with cancer were evaluated 
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results indicated that plasma 
YKL-40 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in dogs with cancer than in 
healthy dogs. A significant decrease in the YAA titers was detected in the dogs 
with cancer when compared with those of the healthy dogs (p < 0.05), although 
the change was not correlated with the YKL-40 levels. Among the dogs with 
cancer, plasma YKL-40 levels in the dogs that later relapsed or had metastasis 
were significantly higher than in the dogs with no signs of relapse (p < 0.01) 
or metastasis (p < 0.05). The relapse and metastasis rates were significantly 
higher in the high YKL-40 group (> 180 pg/mL) than in the low YKL-40 group (< 
180 pg/mL). The results imply that plasma YKL-40 levels might have the potential 
to be developed as a marker of malignancy progression and prognosis in canine 
cancers.
