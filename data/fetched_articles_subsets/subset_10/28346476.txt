The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS; velo-cardio-facial syndrome; DiGeorge 
syndrome) is a congenital anomaly disorder in which haploinsufficiency of TBX1, 
encoding a T-box transcription factor, is the major candidate for cardiac 
outflow tract (OFT) malformations. Inactivation of Tbx1 in the anterior heart 
field (AHF) mesoderm in the mouse results in premature expression of 
pro-differentiation genes and a persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) in which 
septation does not form between the aorta and pulmonary trunk. Canonical 
Wnt/β-catenin has major roles in cardiac OFT development that may act upstream 
of Tbx1. Consistent with an antagonistic relationship, we found the opposite 
gene expression changes occurred in the AHF in β-catenin loss of function 
embryos compared to Tbx1 loss of function embryos, providing an opportunity to 
test for genetic rescue. When both alleles of Tbx1 and one allele of β-catenin 
were inactivated in the Mef2c-AHF-Cre domain, 61% of them (n = 34) showed 
partial or complete rescue of the PTA defect. Upregulated genes that were 
oppositely changed in expression in individual mutant embryos were normalized in 
significantly rescued embryos. Further, β-catenin was increased in expression 
when Tbx1 was inactivated, suggesting that there may be a negative feedback loop 
between canonical Wnt and Tbx1 in the AHF to allow the formation of the OFT. We 
suggest that alteration of this balance may contribute to variable expressivity 
in 22q11.2DS.
