Although very different in etiology and symptoms, numerous neurodegenerative 
diseases can be classified as proteinopathies. More so, evidence indicates that 
the key misfolded proteins at the basis of different neuropathies might share 
common mechanisms of propagation. As such, the prion-like spreading of protein 
aggregates through the neural network is subject of intensive research focus and 
requires adequate models. Here, we made use of the well-defined architecture and 
large accessibility of the visual system, of which the retinotopic connections 
represent a simple route of anterograde signaling and an elegant model to 
investigate transsynaptic, prion-like spreading. In two independent studies, 
uptake and seeding of alpha-synuclein and tau were examined after intravitreal 
injection of preformed fibrils. However, extracellular matrix components in the 
vitreous space and at the vitreoretinal surface appeared to act as a barrier for 
the entry of both fibrils into the retina. These results show that further 
experimental refinement is needed to fully realize the potential of the visual 
system as a model for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of 
anterograde, transsynaptic spreading of prion-like proteins.
