The allele and genotype frequency distributions of polymorphic markers of genes 
coding for antioxidant enzymes were compared for type 1 diabetes mellitus 
patients with or without diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). The groups (total 180 
patients) had nonoverlapping (polar) phenotypes. Group DPN+ included 86 patients 
with DPN and diabetic record no more than 5 years. Control group DPN- included 
patients without DPN and diabetic record of at least 10 years. Comparative 
analysis with Fisher's exact test revealed a significant difference in allele 
and genotype frequency distributions of the T(-262)C polymorphic marker of the 
CAT gene. Polymorphic markers C1167T of the CAT gene, Pro/Leu of the GPX1 gene, 
0/+ of the GSTT1 gene, and 0/+ of the GSTM1 gene showed no significant 
difference in allele or genotype frequency distribution. On this evidence, these 
markers were not associated with DPN in the sample examined.
