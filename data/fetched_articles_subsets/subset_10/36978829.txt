Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in GRN gene, which encodes progranulin (PGRN), 
cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP). 
FTLD-TDP is one of the most common forms of early onset dementia, but its 
pathogenesis is not fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been 
associated with several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we 
have investigated whether mitochondrial alterations could also contribute to the 
pathogenesis of PGRN deficiency-associated FTLD-TDP. Our results showed that 
PGRN deficiency induced mitochondrial depolarization, increased ROS production 
and lowered ATP levels in GRN KD SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Interestingly, 
lymphoblasts from FTLD-TDP patients carrying a LOF mutation in the GRN gene 
(c.709-1G > A) also demonstrated mitochondrial depolarization and lower ATP 
levels. Such mitochondrial damage increased mitochondrial fission to remove 
dysfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy. Interestingly, PGRN-deficient cells 
showed elevated mitochondrial mass together with autophagy dysfunction, implying 
that PGRN deficiency induced the accumulation of damaged mitochondria by 
blocking its degradation in the lysosomes. Importantly, the treatment with two 
brain-penetrant CK-1δ inhibitors (IGS-2.7 and IGS-3.27), known for preventing 
the phosphorylation and cytosolic accumulation of TDP-43, rescued mitochondrial 
function in PGRN-deficient cells. Taken together, these results suggest that 
mitochondrial function is impaired in FTLD-TDP associated with LOF GRN mutations 
and that the TDP-43 pathology linked to PGRN deficiency might be a key mechanism 
contributing to such mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, our results point 
to the use of drugs targeting TDP-43 pathology as a promising therapeutic 
strategy for restoring mitochondrial function in FTLD-TDP and other 
TDP-43-related diseases.
