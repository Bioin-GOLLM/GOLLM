BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the influence of the 
polymorphisms G1784C (rs4822063) and A2386G (rs12487736) of SREBP-2 and SCAP 
genes, respectively, on the response to atorvastatin treatment in a cohort of 
Chilean subjects with Amerindian background.
METHODS: A total of 142 hypercholesterolemic individuals underwent atorvastatin 
therapy (10 mg/day/1 month). Serum lipids levels before and after treatment were 
measured. Genotyping of the studied polymorphisms and ethnic characterization 
through Amerindian haplogroups (A, B, C, and D) of mitochondrial DNA was 
achieved by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP), respectively.
RESULTS: Of all individuals, 85 % turned out to be Amerindian. C allele carriers 
for polymorphism G1784C, had a lower total cholesterol reduction (p = 0.015) and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p = 0.013). No differences were 
found for the A2386G variant. However, those who carried both polymorphisms had 
a lower LDL-C reduction than carriers of just one of the variants (p = 0.030).
CONCLUSION: The G1784C polymorphism of SREBP-2 gene affects atorvastatin 
response in Chilean subjects with Amerindian background, and may be an important 
marker for predicting efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy.
