Luminal breast cancers are typically estrogen receptor-positive and generally 
have the best prognosis. However, a subset of luminal tumors, namely luminal B 
cancers, frequently metastasize and recur. Unfortunately, the causal events that 
drive their progression are unknown, and therefore it is difficult to identify 
individuals who are likely to relapse and should receive escalated treatment. 
Here, we identify a bifunctional RasGAP tumor suppressor whose expression is 
lost in almost 50% of luminal B tumors. Moreover, we show that two RasGAP genes 
are concomitantly suppressed in the most aggressive luminal malignancies. 
Importantly, these genes cooperatively regulate two major oncogenic pathways, 
RAS and NF-κB, through distinct domains, and when inactivated drive the 
metastasis of luminal tumors in vivo Finally, although the cooperative effects 
on RAS drive invasion, NF-κB activation triggers epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition and is required for metastasis. Collectively, these studies reveal 
important mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of luminal B tumors and 
provide functionally relevant prognostic biomarkers that may guide treatment 
decisions.
SIGNIFICANCE: The lack of insight into mechanisms that underlie the aggressive 
behavior of luminal B breast cancers impairs treatment decisions and therapeutic 
advances. Here, we show that two RasGAP tumor suppressors are concomitantly 
suppressed in aggressive luminal B tumors and demonstrate that they drive 
metastasis by activating RAS and NF-κB. Cancer Discov; 7(2); 202-17. ©2016
