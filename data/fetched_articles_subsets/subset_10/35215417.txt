Metabolic detoxification (detox)-or biotransformation-is a physiological 
function that removes toxic substances from our body. Genetic variability and 
dietary factors may affect the function of detox enzymes, thus impacting the 
body's sensitivity to toxic substances of endogenous and exogenous origin. From 
a genetic perspective, most of the current knowledge relies on observational 
studies in humans or experimental models in vivo and in vitro, with very limited 
proof of causality and clinical value. This review provides health practitioners 
with a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within genes 
involved in Phase I and Phase II detoxification reactions, for which evidence of 
clinical utility does exist. We have selected these SNPs based on their 
association with interindividual variability of detox metabolism in response to 
certain nutrients in the context of human clinical trials. In order to 
facilitate clinical interpretation and usage of these SNPs, we provide, for each 
of them, a strength of evidence score based on recent guidelines for 
genotype-based dietary advice. We also present the association of these SNPs 
with functional biomarkers of detox metabolism in a pragmatic clinical trial, 
the LIFEHOUSE study.
