Disease relapse remains a major cause of death in patients with BCR-ABL-positive 
leukemia despite advances in treatment with kinase inhibitors. Significant 
efforts are underway to target pathways that maintain leukemia stem cells. 
Targeting these pathways holds promise for definitive leukemia eradication or 
improvement of the effectiveness of currently available therapies.
