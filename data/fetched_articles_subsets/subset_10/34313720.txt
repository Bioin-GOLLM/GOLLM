PURPOSE: We aim to characterize the pathways required for autofluorescent 
granule (AFG) formation by RPE cells using cultured monolayers.
METHODS: We fed RPE monolayers in culture with a single pulse of photoreceptor 
outer segments (POS). After 24 hours the cells started accumulating AFGs that 
were comparable to lipofuscin in vivo. Using this model, we used a variety of 
light and electron microscopical techniques, flow cytometry and Western blot to 
analyze the formation of AFGs. We also generated a mutant RPE line lacking 
cathepsin D by gene editing.
RESULTS: AFGs seem to derive from incompletely digested POS-containing 
phagosomes and after 3 days are surrounded by a single membrane positive for 
lysosome markers. We show by various methods that lysosome-phagosome fusion is 
required for AFG formation, and that impairment of lysosomal pH or catalytic 
activity, particularly cathepsin D activity, enhances AF accumulation.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that lysosomal dysfunction results in incomplete POS 
degradation and enhanced AFG accumulation.
