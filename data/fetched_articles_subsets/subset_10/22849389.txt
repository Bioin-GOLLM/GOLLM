BACKGROUND: Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that results 
from a deficiency of the enzyme Î±-galactosidase A. Fabry disease is present in 
4-5% of men with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy or cryptogenic stroke. 
As enzyme replacement therapy is now more widely available, it is important to 
recognise the signs and symptoms of the disease and establish the diagnosis so 
that early treatment can be started before irreversible organ damage occurs.
CASE PRESENTATION: A previously fit and well 32-year-old Caucasian male 
presented with multisystem dysfunction including renal impairment. Although he 
had no suggestive symptoms, a diagnosis of Fabry disease was first established 
on a native renal biopsy. This was confirmed by enzymatic testing and subsequent 
genetic analysis that revealed a potentially new pathogenic variant.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance both of Fabry disease as a 
differential diagnosis in patients with renal impairment in the context of 
multi-system disease and also of adequate tissue sampling for electron 
microscopy when performing native renal biopsies.
