Hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) is caused by mutations in the 
vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. Arg274 located in the ligand binding domain (LBD) 
of VDR is responsible for anchoring 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3) by 
forming a hydrogen bond with the 1α-hydroxyl group of 1α,25(OH)2D3. The 
Arg274Leu (R274L) mutation identified in patients with HVDRR causes a 1000-fold 
decrease in the affinity for 1α,25(OH)2D3, and dramatically reduces vitamin D- 
related gene expression. Recently, we successfully constructed fusion proteins 
consisting of split-luciferase and LBD of the VDR. The chimeric protein 
LucC-LBD-LucN, which displays the C-terminal domain of luciferase (LucC) at its 
N-terminus, can detect and discriminate between VDR agonists and antagonists. 
The LucC-LBD (R274L)-LucN was constructed to screen high-affinity ligands for 
the mutant VDR (R274L). Of the 33 vitamin D analogs, 5 showed much higher 
affinities for the mutant VDR (R274L) than 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 
2α-[2-(tetrazol-2-yl)ethyl]-1α,25-(OH)2D3 showed the highest affinity. These 
compounds might be potential therapeutics for HVDRR caused by the mutant VDR 
(R274L).
