This review article is focused on the research progress made utilizing the 
wobbler mouse as animal model for human motor neuron diseases, especially the 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The wobbler mouse develops progressive 
degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons and shows striking similarities to 
ALS. The cellular effects of the wobbler mutation, cellular transport defects, 
neurofilament aggregation, neuronal hyperexcitability and neuroinflammation 
closely resemble human ALS. Now, 57 years after the first report on the wobbler 
mouse we summarize the progress made in understanding the disease mechanism and 
testing various therapeutic approaches and discuss the relevance of these 
advances for human ALS. The identification of the causative mutation linking the 
wobbler mutation to a vesicle transport factor and the research focussed on the 
cellular basis and the therapeutic treatment of the wobbler motor neuron 
degeneration has shed new light on the molecular pathology of the disease and 
might contribute to the understanding the complexity of ALS.
