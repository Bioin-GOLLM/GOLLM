The broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) VRC01 is being evaluated for its 
efficacy to prevent HIV-1 infection in the Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) 
trials. A secondary objective of AMP utilizes sieve analysis to investigate how 
VRC01 prevention efficacy (PE) varies with HIV-1 envelope (Env) amino acid (AA) 
sequence features. An exhaustive analysis that tests how PE depends on every AA 
feature with sufficient variation would have low statistical power. To design an 
adequately powered primary sieve analysis for AMP, we modeled VRC01 
neutralization as a function of Env AA sequence features of 611 HIV-1 gp160 
pseudoviruses from the CATNAP database, with objectives: (1) to develop models 
that best predict the neutralization readouts; and (2) to rank AA features by 
their predictive importance with classification and regression methods. The 
dataset was split in half, and machine learning algorithms were applied to each 
half, each analyzed separately using cross-validation and hold-out validation. 
We selected Super Learner, a nonparametric ensemble-based cross-validated 
learning method, for advancement to the primary sieve analysis. This method 
predicted the dichotomous resistance outcome of whether the IC50 neutralization 
titer of VRC01 for a given Env pseudovirus is right-censored (indicating 
resistance) with an average validated AUC of 0.868 across the two hold-out 
datasets. Quantitative log IC50 was predicted with an average validated R2 of 
0.355. Features predicting neutralization sensitivity or resistance included 26 
surface-accessible residues in the VRC01 and CD4 binding footprints, the length 
of gp120, the length of Env, the number of cysteines in gp120, the number of 
cysteines in Env, and 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites; the top features 
will be advanced to the primary sieve analysis. This modeling framework may also 
inform the study of VRC01 in the treatment of HIV-infected persons.
