Previous studies have demonstrated both energy restriction (ER) and higher 
protein (HP), lower carbohydrate (LC) diets downregulate hepatic de novo 
lipogenesis. Little is known about the independent and combined impact of ER and 
HP/LC diets on tissue-specific lipid kinetics in leptin receptor-deficient, 
obese rodents. This study investigated the effects of ER and dietary 
macronutrient content on body composition; hepatic, subcutaneous adipose tissue 
(SAT), and visceral AT (VAT) lipid metabolic flux (2 H2 O-labeling); and blood 
and liver measures of cardiometabolic health in six-week-old female obese Zucker 
rats (Leprfa+/fa+ ). Animals were randomized to a 10-week feeding intervention: 
ad libitum (AL)-HC/LP (76% carbohydrate/15% protein), AL-HP/LC (35% protein/56% 
carbohydrate), ER-HC/LP, or ER-HP/LC. ER groups consumed 60% of the feed 
consumed by AL. AL gained more fat mass than ER (P-energy = 0.012) and HP/LC 
gained more fat mass than HC/LP (P-diet = 0.025). Hepatic triglyceride (TG) 
concentrations (P-interaction = 0.0091) and absolute hepatic TG synthesis 
(P-interaction = 0.012) were lower in ER-HP/LC versus ER-HC/LP. ER had increased 
hepatic, SAT, and VAT de novo cholesterol fractional synthesis, absolute hepatic 
cholesterol synthesis, and serum cholesterol (P-energy≤0.0035). A HP/LC diet, 
independent of energy intake, led to greater gains in fat mass. A HP/LC diet, in 
the context of ER, led to reductions in absolute hepatic TG synthesis and TG 
content. However, ER worsened cholesterol metabolism. Increased adipose tissue 
TG retention with the HP/LC diet may reflect improved lipid storage capacity and 
be beneficial in this genetic model of obesity.
