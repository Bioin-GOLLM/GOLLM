Ageing is intimately connected to the induction of cell senescence1,2, but why 
this is so remains poorly understood. A key challenge is the identification of 
pathways that normally suppress senescence, are lost during ageing and 
are functionally relevant to oppose ageing3. Here we connected the structural 
and functional decline of ageing tissues to attenuated function of the master 
effectors of cellular mechanosignalling YAP and TAZ. YAP/TAZ activity declines 
during physiological ageing in stromal cells, and mimicking such decline through 
genetic inactivation of YAP/TAZ in these cells leads to accelerated ageing. 
Conversely, sustaining YAP function rejuvenates old cells and opposes the 
emergence of ageing-related traits associated with either physiological ageing 
or accelerated ageing triggered by a mechano-defective extracellular matrix. 
Ageing traits induced by inactivation of YAP/TAZ are preceded by induction of 
tissue senescence. This occurs because YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction suppresses 
cGAS-STING signalling, to the extent that inhibition of STING prevents tissue 
senescence and premature ageing-related tissue degeneration after YAP/TAZ 
inactivation. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ-mediated control of cGAS-STING 
signalling relies on the unexpected role of YAP/TAZ in preserving nuclear 
envelope integrity, at least in part through direct transcriptional regulation 
of lamin B1 and ACTR2, the latter of which is involved in building the 
peri-nuclear actin cap. The findings demonstrate that declining YAP/TAZ 
mechanotransduction drives ageing by unleashing cGAS-STING signalling, a pillar 
of innate immunity. Thus, sustaining YAP/TAZ mechanosignalling or inhibiting 
STING may represent promising approaches for limiting senescence-associated 
inflammation and improving healthy ageing.
