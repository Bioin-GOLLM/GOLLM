BACKGROUND: Exercise is postulated to be a promising non-pharmacological 
intervention for the improvement of neurodegenerative disease pathology. 
However, the mechanism of beneficial effects of exercise on the brain remains to 
be further explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of an 
exercise-induced metabolite, lactate, on the microglia phenotype and its 
association with learning and memory.
RESULTS: Microglia were hyperactivated in the brains of AlCl3/D-gal-treated 
mice, which was associated with cognitive decline. Running exercise ameliorated 
the hyperactivation and increased the anti-inflammatory/reparative phenotype of 
microglia and improved cognition. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 
sodium lactate (NaLA) had similar beneficial effects as that of exercise 
training. Exogenous NaLA addition to cultured BV2 cells promoted their 
transition from a pro-inflammatory to a reparative phenotype.
CONCLUSION: The elevated lactate acted as an "accelerator" of the endogenous 
"lactate timer" in microglia promoting this transition of microglia polarization 
balance through lactylation. These findings demonstrate that exercise-induced 
lactate accelerates the phenotypic transition of microglia, which plays a key 
role in reducing neuroinflammation and improving cognitive function.
