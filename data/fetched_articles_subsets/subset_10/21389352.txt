The Werner syndrome protein (WRN) is a member of the human RecQ family DNA 
helicases implicated in the maintenance of genome stability. Loss of WRN gives 
rise to the Werner syndrome, a genetic disease characterised by premature aging 
and cancer predisposition. WRN plays a crucial role in the response to 
replication stress and significantly contributes to the recovery of stalled 
replication forks, although how this function is regulated is not fully 
appreciated. There is a growing body of evidence that WRN accomplishes its task 
in close connection with the replication checkpoint. In eukaryotic cells, the 
replication checkpoint response, which involves both the ATR and ATM kinase 
activities, is deputed to the maintenance of fork integrity and re-establishment 
of fork progression. Our recent findings indicate that ATR and ATM modulate WRN 
function at defined steps of the response to replication fork arrest. This 
review focuses on the novel evidence of a functional relationship between WRN 
and the replication checkpoint and how this cross-talk might contribute to 
prevent genome instability, a common feature of senescent and cancer cells.
