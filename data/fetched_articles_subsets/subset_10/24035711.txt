We describe an improved method for comparative modeling, RosettaCM, which 
optimizes a physically realistic all-atom energy function over the 
conformational space defined by homologous structures. Given a set of sequence 
alignments, RosettaCM assembles topologies by recombining aligned segments in 
Cartesian space and building unaligned regions de novo in torsion space. The 
junctions between segments are regularized using a loop closure method combining 
fragment superposition with gradient-based minimization. The energies of the 
resulting models are optimized by all-atom refinement, and the most 
representative low-energy model is selected. The CASP10 experiment suggests that 
RosettaCM yields models with more accurate side-chain and backbone conformations 
than other methods when the sequence identity to the templates is greater than 
∼15%.
