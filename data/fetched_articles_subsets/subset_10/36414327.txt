BACKGROUND: To study whether there is genetic overlap underlying the risk for 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) and low intelligence quotient (IQ), we 
reviewed and summarized the evidence on genetic variants associated with both 
traits.
METHODS: We performed this review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and preregistered it in 
PROSPERO. We searched the Medline databases via PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science 
and Scopus. We included studies in adults with a diagnosis of SSD that explored 
genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], copy number variants 
[CNVs], genomic insertions or genomic deletions), estimated IQ and studied the 
relationship between genetic variability and both traits (SSD and IQ). We 
synthesized the results and assessed risk of bias using the Quality of Genetic 
Association Studies (Q-Genie) tool.
RESULTS: Fifty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (45 case-control, 9 
cross-sectional, 1 cohort), of which 55% reported significant associations for 
genetic variants involved in IQ and SSD. The SNPs more frequently explored 
through candidate gene studies were in COMT, DTNBP1, BDNF and TCF4. Through 
genome-wide association studies, 2 SNPs in CHD7 and GATAD2A were associated with 
IQ in patients with SSD. The studies on CNVs suggested significant associations 
between structural variants and low IQ in patients with SSD.
LIMITATIONS: Overall, primary studies used heterogeneous IQ measurement tools 
and had small samples. Grey literature was not screened.
CONCLUSION: Genetic overlap between SSD and IQ supports the neurodevelopmental 
hypothesis of schizophrenia. Most of the risk polymorphisms identified were in 
genes relevant to brain development, neural proliferation and differentiation, 
and synaptic plasticity.
