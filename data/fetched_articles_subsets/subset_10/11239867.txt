PURPOSE: To report a novel missense mutation and DNA polymorphism of the 
CYP1B1gene in Japanese patients with primary congenital glaucoma.
METHODS: A series of 11 unrelated patients with primary congenital glaucoma was 
examined. Patients were followed in the Kagoshima University Hospital between 
1979 and 1998. DNA was extracted from leukocytes of the patients, their 
families, and unrelated healthy individuals. Amplicons spanning the coding 
regions of the CYP1B1 gene were examined by direct sequencing and 
enzyme-restriction detection.
RESULTS: In the 11 unrelated patients, besides the previously reported 
insertional mutation (1620 ins G), a novel missense mutation was identified at 
codons 444 to replace arginine with glutamine (R444Q) in one patient. The novel 
missense mutation cosegregated in the relevant family as an autosomal recessive 
pattern and was not found in other patients or control individuals. In addition, 
five polymorphic sites were found at codons 48, 119, 330, 432, and 449. These 
polymorphic alleles did not cosegregate with the disease, and they were found in 
healthy individuals as well.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 20% of Japanese patients with primary congenital 
glaucoma may be affected by mutations in the CYP1B1 gene. Further studies are 
justified to explore whether a relationship exists between the phenotypic 
expressivity of the disease and the type of mutation.
