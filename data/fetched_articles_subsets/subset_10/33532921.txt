BACKGROUND: Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs), also known as visual pathway gliomas, 
are debilitating tumors that account for 3-5% of all pediatric brain tumors. 
They are most commonly WHO grade 1 pilocytic astrocytomas and frequently occur 
in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. The location of these tumors results 
in visual loss and blindness, endocrine and hypothalamic dysfunction, 
hydrocephalus, and premature death. Their involvement of the visual pathways and 
proximity to other eloquent brain structures typically precludes complete 
resection or optimal radiation dosing without incurring significant neurological 
injury. There are various surgical interventions that can be performed in 
relation to these lesions including biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid diversion, and 
partial or radical resection, but their role is a source of debate. This study 
catalogues our surgical experience and patient outcomes in order to support 
decision-making in this challenging pathology.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all cases of OPGs treated in a single center 
from July 1990 to July 2020. Data was collected on patient demographics, 
radiographic findings, pathology, and management including surgical 
interventions. Outcome data included survival, visual function, endocrine, and 
hypothalamic dysfunction.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one patients with OPG were identified, and 50 of 
these patients underwent a total of 104 surgical procedures. These included 
biopsy (31), subtotal or gross total resection (20 operations in 17 patients), 
cyst drainage (17), Ommaya reservoir insertion (9), or cerebrospinal fluid 
diversion (27). During the study period, there was 6% overall mortality, 18% 
hypothalamic dysfunction, 20% endocrine dysfunction, and 42% had some cognitive 
dysfunction. At diagnosis 75% of patients had good or moderate visual function 
in at least one eye, and overall, this improved to 83% at the end of the study 
period. In comparison the worst eye had good or moderate visual function in 56%, 
and this reduced to 53%. Baseline and final visual function were poorer in 
patients who had a surgical resection, but improvements in vision were still 
found-particularly in the best eye.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: OPG are debilitating childhood tumor that have lifelong 
consequences in terms of visual function and endocrinopathies/hypothalamic 
dysfunction; this can result in substantial patient morbidity. Decisions 
regarding management and the role of surgery in this condition are challenging 
and include cerebrospinal fluid diversion, biopsy, and in highly select cases 
cystic decompression or surgical resection. In this paper, we review our own 
experience, outcomes, and surgical philosophy.
