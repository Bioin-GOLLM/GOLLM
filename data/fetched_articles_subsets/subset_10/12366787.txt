In this report, we describe the identification of HLA-A*1112, a novel HLA-A*11 
allele found in two Italian families. The new allele was detected during routine 
HLA typing by a polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer and was 
confirmed by high-resolution sequencing-based typing. The nucleotide sequences 
of HLA-A*1112 exons 2 and 3 are identical to HLA-A*11011 except for a single 
nucleotide substitution in codon 90 (GAC-->GCC).
