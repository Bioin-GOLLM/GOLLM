BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in endothelial 
homeostasis. Asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA), L-N monomethyl arginine 
(L-NMMA) and symmetric dimethyl arginine (SDMA), which are derivatives of 
methylarginine, directly or indirectly reduce NO production. Therefore, these 
metabolites are an important risk factor for various diseases, including 
cardiovascular diseases. Numerous methods have been developed for the 
measurement of methylarginine derivatives, but various difficulties have been 
encountered. This study aimed to develop a reliable, fast and cost-effective 
method for the analysis and measurement of methylarginine derivatives (ADMA, 
SDMA, L-NMMA) and related metabolites (arginine, citrulline, homoarginine, 
ornithine), and to validate this method according to Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute (CLSI) protocols.
METHODS: For the analysis of ADMA, SDMA, L-NMMA, arginine, homoarginine, 
citrulline, ornithine, 200 Âµl of serum were precipitated with methanol, and 
subsequently derivatized with a butanol solution containing 5% acetyl chloride. 
Butyl derivatives were separated using a C18 reverse phase column with a 5 min 
run time. Detection of analytes was achieved by utilising the specific 
fragmentation patterns identified through tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: The method was linear for ADMA, SDMA, L-NMMA, ornithine, arginine, 
homoarginine and citrulline in the ranges of 0.023-6.0, 0.021-5.5, 0.019-5.0, 
0.015-250, 0.015-250, 0.019-5 and 0.015-250 µM, respectively. The inter-assay 
CV% values for all analytes was less than 9.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained from method validation studies shows that the 
developed method is highly sensitive, precise and accurate. Short analysis time, 
cost-effectiveness, and multiplexed analysis of these metabolites, with the same 
pretreatment steps, are the main advantages of the method.
