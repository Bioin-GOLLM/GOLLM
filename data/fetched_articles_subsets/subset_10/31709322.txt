Hyperlipidemia is a major causal risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary 
heart disease (CHD). Angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) has emerged as a promising 
molecular target to reduce CHD risk due to its regulation of all 3 major lipid 
traits: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, and triglycerides. Here, the authors review the discovery of 
ANGPTL3, the role of ANGPTL3 in lipoprotein metabolism, and the genetic 
association between naturally occurring ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations and 
CHD. In light of the favorable consequences of ANGPTL3 deficiency, various 
therapeutic strategies to target ANGPTL3 are currently in development, including 
a monoclonal antibody, an antisense oligonucleotide, and gene editing.
