Both poly(A) enrichment and ribosomal RNA depletion are commonly used for RNA 
sequencing. Either has its advantages and disadvantages that may lead to biases 
in the downstream analyses. To better access these effects, we carried out both 
ribosomal RNA-depleted and poly(A)-selected RNA-seq for CD4+ T naive cells 
isolated from 40 healthy individuals from the Blueprint Project. For these 40 
individuals, the genomic and epigenetic data were also available. This dataset 
offers a unique opportunity to understand how library construction influences 
differential gene expression, alternative splicing and molecular QTL 
(quantitative loci) analyses for human primary cells.
