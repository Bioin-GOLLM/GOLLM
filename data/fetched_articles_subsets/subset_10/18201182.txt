AIM: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) e antigen (HBeAg) is translated from precore mRNA 
as a precore/core protein, which is post-translationally modified to give rise 
to the protein that is secreted into the serum. The G1862T mutation in HBV 
occurs in the bulge of the encapsidation signal within the pregenomic RNA. When 
the precore mRNA is translated, this mutation results in a valine to 
phenylalanine substitution at the -3 position to the signal peptide cleavage 
site at the amino end of the precursor protein. The aim of this study was to 
determine whether this mutation could affect HBV replication and/or HBeAg 
expression.
METHODS: Following transfection of Huh 7 cells, HBV replication was followed 
using real time polymerase reaction (PCR) and expression of HBeAg expression was 
monitored using confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: HBV replication was reduced when this mutation was introduced into 
genotype D but not into genotype A replication-competent constructs. Using 
mutant HBeAg-expressing plasmids, we demonstrated a 54% reduction in HBeAg 
secretion relative to the wild type. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the 
mutant HBeAg accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum, endoplasmic reticulum 
intermediate compartment and Golgi. These aggregates of mutant protein increased 
in size following treatment of the cells with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and 
had the hallmark features of aggresomes. They attracted ubiquitin, heat shock 
proteins and proteasomes and were isolated from the cytosol by the intermediate 
filaments, vimentin and cytokeratin.
CONCLUSION: The formation of aggresomes, as a result of the G1862T mutation, may 
play a contributory role in HBV-induced liver disease.
