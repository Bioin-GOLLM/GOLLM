BACKGROUND: Oncogenic mutations in the KRAS gene are very common in human 
cancers, resulting in cells with well-characterized selective advantages. For 
more than three decades, the development of effective therapeutics to 
inhibit KRAS-driven tumorigenesis has proved a formidable challenge and KRAS was 
considered 'undruggable'. Therefore, multi-targeted therapy may provide a 
reasonable strategy for the effective treatment of KRAS-driven cancers. Here, we 
assess the efficacy and mechanistic rationale for combining HASPIN and mTOR 
inhibition as a potential therapy for cancers carrying KRAS mutations.
METHODS: We investigated the synergistic effect of a combination of mTOR and 
HASPIN inhibitors on cell viability, cell cycle, cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and 
mitotic catastrophe using a panel of human KRAS-mutant and wild-type tumor cell 
lines. Subsequently, the human transplant models were used to test the 
therapeutic efficacy and pharmacodynamic effects of the dual therapy.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that the combination of mTOR and HASPIN inhibitors 
induced potent synergistic cytotoxic effects in KRAS-mutant cell lines and 
delayed the growth of human tumor xenograft. Mechanistically, we showed that 
inhibiting of mTOR potentiates HASPIN inhibition by preventing the 
phosphorylation of H3 histones, exacerbating mitotic catastrophe and DNA damage 
in tumor cell lines with KRAS mutations, and this effect is due in part to a 
reduction in VRK1.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that increased DNA damage and mitotic 
catastrophe are the basis for the effective synergistic effect observed with 
mTOR and HASPIN inhibition, and support the clinical evaluation of this dual 
therapy in patients with KRAS-mutant tumors.
