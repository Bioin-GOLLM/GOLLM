Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an efficiently transmitted, fatal, and 
progressive prion disease of cervids with an as yet to be fully clarified host 
range. While outbred domestic cats (Felis catus) have recently been shown to be 
susceptible to experimental CWD infection, the neuropathologic features of the 
infection are lacking. Such information is vital to provide diagnostic power in 
the event of natural interspecies transmission and insights into host and strain 
interactions in interspecies prion infection. Using light microscopy and 
immunohistochemistry, we detail the topographic pattern of neural spongiosis 
(the "lesion profile") and the distribution of misfolded prion protein in the 
primary and secondary passage of feline CWD (Fel(CWD)). We also evaluated 
cellular and subcellular associations between misfolded prion protein (PrP(D)) 
and central nervous system neurons and glial cell populations. From these 
studies, we (1) describe the novel neuropathologic profile of Fel(CWD), which is 
distinct from either cervid CWD or feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE), and 
(2) provide evidence of serial passage-associated interspecies prion adaptation. 
In addition, we demonstrate through confocal analysis the successful 
co-localization of PrP(D) with neurons, astrocytes, microglia, lysosomes, and 
synaptophysin, which, in part, implicates each of these in the neuropathology of 
Fel(CWD). In conclusion, this work illustrates the simultaneous role of both 
host and strain in the development of a unique Fel(CWD) neuropathologic profile 
and that such a profile can be used to discriminate between Fel(CWD) and FSE.
