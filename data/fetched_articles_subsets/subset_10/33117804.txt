Genetic mutations and abnormal gene regulation are key mechanisms underlying 
tumorigenesis. Nucleosomes, which consist of DNA wrapped around histone cores, 
represent the basic units of chromatin. The fifth amino group (Nε) of histone 
lysine residues is a common site for post-translational modifications (PTMs), 
and of these, acetylation is the second most common. Histone acetylation is 
modulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), 
and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. Over the past two decades, 
numerous studies characterizing HDACs and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have provided 
novel and exciting insights concerning their underlying biological mechanisms 
and potential anti-cancer treatments. In this review, we detail the diverse 
structures of HDACs and their underlying biological functions, including 
transcriptional regulation, metabolism, angiogenesis, DNA damage response, cell 
cycle, apoptosis, protein degradation, immunity and other several physiological 
processes. We also highlight potential avenues to use HDACi as novel, precision 
cancer treatments.
