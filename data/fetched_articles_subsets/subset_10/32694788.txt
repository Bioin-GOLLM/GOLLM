Catecholamines stimulate the mobilization of stored triglycerides in adipocytes 
to provide fatty acids (FAs) for other tissues. However, a large proportion is 
taken back up and either oxidized or re-esterified. What controls the 
disposition of these FAs in adipocytes remains unknown. Here, we report that 
catecholamines redirect FAs for oxidation through the phosphorylation of signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Adipocyte STAT3 is 
phosphorylated upon activation of Î²-adrenergic receptors, and in turn suppresses 
FA re-esterification to promote FA oxidation. Adipocyte-specific Stat3 KO mice 
exhibit normal rates of lipolysis, but exhibit defective lipolysis-driven 
oxidative metabolism, resulting in reduced energy expenditure and increased 
adiposity when they are on a high-fat diet. This previously unappreciated, 
non-genomic role of STAT3 explains how sympathetic activation can increase both 
lipolysis and FA oxidation in adipocytes, revealing a new regulatory axis in 
metabolism.
