The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) mediate diverse 
membrane remodeling events. These typically require ESCRT-III proteins to 
stabilize negatively curved membranes; however, recent work has indicated that 
certain ESCRT-IIIs also participate in positive-curvature membrane-shaping 
reactions. ESCRT-IIIs polymerize into membrane-binding filaments, but the 
structural basis for negative versus positive membrane remodeling by these 
proteins remains poorly understood. To learn how certain ESCRT-IIIs shape 
positively curved membranes, we determined structures of human membrane-bound 
CHMP1B-only, membrane-bound CHMP1B + IST1, and IST1-only filaments by cryo-EM. 
Our structures show how CHMP1B first polymerizes into a single-stranded helical 
filament, shaping membranes into moderate-curvature tubules. Subsequently, IST1 
assembles a second strand on CHMP1B, further constricting the membrane tube and 
reducing its diameter nearly to the fission point. Each step of constriction 
thins the underlying bilayer, lowering the barrier to membrane fission. Our 
structures reveal how a two-component, sequential polymerization mechanism 
drives membrane tubulation, constriction and bilayer thinning.
