The focus of this review is to examine the role of ITK signaling in multiple 
diseases and investigate the clinical potential of ITK inhibition. The diseases 
and potential interventions reviewed include T cell-derived malignancies as well 
as other neoplastic diseases, allergic diseases such as asthma and atopic 
dermatitis, certain infectious diseases, several autoimmune disorders such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and finally the use of ITK inhibition in 
both solid organ and bone marrow transplantation recipients.
