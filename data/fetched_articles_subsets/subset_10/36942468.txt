BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma. The expression of CD56 in DLBCL is highly unusual. Little is known 
about its incidence and clinical importance. So far, no genetic profiling was 
performed in CD56 positive DLBCL.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tissue microarrays have been constructed, sectioned, and 
stained by H&E and immunohistochemistry for 229 patients with DLBCL diagnosed 
2008-2017. For CD56 positive cases, clinical data was collected including age at 
diagnosis, stage of the disease, International Prognostic Index (IPI) score, 
treatment scheme and number of chemotherapy cycles, radiation therapy, treatment 
outcome, and possible relapse of the disease. Overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated. For four patients, RNA was 
extracted and targeted RNA (cDNA) sequencing of 125 genes was performed with the 
Archer FusionPlex Lymphoma kit.
RESULTS: CD56 expression was found in 7 cases (3%). The intensity of expression 
varied from weak to moderate focal, to very intensive and diffuse. All patients 
had de novo DLBCL. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 54.5 years. Five 
of them were women and 2 males. According to the Hans algorithm, 6 patients had 
the germinal centre B cells (GBC) type and one non-GBC (activated B-cell [ABC]) 
type, double expressor. Genetic profiling of four patients according to 
Schmitz's classification showed that 1 case was of the BN2 subtype, 1 of EZB 
subtype, 2 were unclassified. The six treated patients reached a complete 
response and did not experience progression of the disease during the median 
follow-up period of 80.5 months.
CONCLUSIONS: We report on one of the largest series of CD56+DLBCL with detailed 
clinicopathological data and for the first time described genetical findings in 
a limited number of patients. Our results show that CD56 expression is rare, but 
seems to be present in prognostic favourable subtypes of DLBCL not otherwise 
specified (NOS) as tested by immunohistochemical or genetic profiling.
