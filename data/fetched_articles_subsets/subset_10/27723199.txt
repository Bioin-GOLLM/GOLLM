Research and therapeutic targeting of the phosphoserine/threonine phosphatases 
PP1 and PP2A is hindered by the lack of selective inhibitors. The microcystin 
(MC) natural toxins target both phosphatases with equal potency, and their 
complex synthesis has complicated structure-activity relationship studies in the 
past. We report herein the synthesis and biochemical evaluation of 11 MC 
analogues, which was accomplished through an efficient strategy combining solid- 
and solution-phase approaches. Our approach led to the first MC analogue with 
submicromolar inhibitory potency that is strongly selective for PP2A over PP1 
and does not require the complex lipophilic Adda group. Through mutational and 
structural analyses, we identified a new key element for binding, as well as 
reasons for the selectivity. This work gives unprecedented insight into how 
selectivity between these phosphatases can be achieved with MC analogues.
