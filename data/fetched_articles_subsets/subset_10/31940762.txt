Urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) is one of the lethal causes of cancer mortality 
of the genitourinary tract. Carcinogenic epidemiological risk factors exposure 
and age over 65 years old are associated with UCC risk. Matrix metalloproteinase 
11 (MMP11) was suggested as a tumor marker of metastasis and predictor of poor 
survival in urothelial carcinomas. In this study, we focused on the associations 
of MMP11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to UCC susceptibility, 
clinicopathological characteristics, and prognosis. In this study, real-time 
polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze five SNPs of MMP11 rs738791, 
rs2267029, rs738792, rs28382575, and rs131451 in 431 patients with UCC and 650 
cancer-free controls. The MMP11 rs28382575 polymorphic "CT" genotype were 
susceptible to UCC (AOR = 2.045, 95% CI = 1.088 - 3.843; p = 0.026). For MMP11 
rs131451, a significant association was found in 166 UCC patients among age â‰¤ 65 
years old who carried MMP11 rs131451 polymorphic "CC" genotype, which is 
associated with lower risk to develop later tumor T status (T1-T4) (OR = 0.375, 
95% CI = 0.159 - 0.887; p = 0.026) compared with the (CT + TT) genotype. 
Furthermore, patients of UCC with rs738792 polymorphic "CC" genotype were 
observed to have higher free of relapse (FS) (p = 0.035), disease specific 
survival rate (p = 0.037), and overall survival rate (p = 0.009) compared with 
the rs738792 (CT + CC) genotype. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that 
the MMP11 SNPs are associated with UCC susceptibility, clinical status, and 
disease survival. The MMP11 polymorphisms may have potential to predict UCC 
susceptibility and prognosis.
