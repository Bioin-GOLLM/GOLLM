We recently reported a positive relationship between occlusal disharmony and 
cardiovascular disease via activation of β-adrenergic signaling in mice. 
Furthermore, inhibition of type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5), a major cardiac 
subtype in adults, protects the heart against oxidative stress. Here, we 
examined the role of AC5 in the development of occlusal-disharmony-induced 
cardiovascular disease in bite-opening (BO) mice, prepared by cementing a 
suitable appliance onto the mandibular incisor. We first examined the effects of 
BO treatment on cardiac function in mice treated or not treated for 2 weeks with 
vidarabine, which we previously identified as an inhibitor of cardiac AC. 
Cardiac function was significantly decreased in the BO group compared to the 
control group, but vidarabine ameliorated the dysfunction. Cardiac fibrosis, 
myocyte apoptosis and myocyte oxidative DNA damage were significantly increased 
in the BO group, but vidarabine blocked these changes. The BO-induced cardiac 
dysfunction was associated with increased phospholamban phosphorylation at 
threonine-17 and serine-16, as well as increased activation of the 
Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II/receptor-interacting protein 3 
signaling pathway. These data suggest that AC5 inhibition with vidarabine might 
be a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
associated with occlusal disharmony.
