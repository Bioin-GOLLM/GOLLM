Next-generation sequencing has led to an explosion of genetic findings for many 
rare diseases. However, most of the variants identified are very rare and were 
also identified in small pedigrees, which creates challenges in terms of 
penetrance estimation and translation into genetic counselling in the setting of 
cascade testing. We use simulations to show that for a rare (dominant) disorder 
where a variant is identified in a small number of small pedigrees, the 
penetrance estimate can both have large uncertainty and be drastically inflated, 
due to underlying ascertainment bias. We have developed PenEst, an app that 
allows users to investigate the phenomenon across ranges of parameter settings. 
We also illustrate robust ascertainment corrections via the LOD (logarithm of 
the odds) score, and recommend a LOD-based approach to assessing pathogenicity 
of rare variants in the presence of reduced penetrance.
