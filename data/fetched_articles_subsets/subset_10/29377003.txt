Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells targeting surface-bound tumor 
antigens have yielded promising clinical outcomes, with two CD19 CAR-T cell 
therapies recently receiving FDA approval for the treatment of B-cell 
malignancies. The adoption of CARs for the recognition of soluble ligands, a 
distinct class of biomarkers in physiology and disease, could considerably 
broaden the utility of CARs in disease treatment. In this study, we demonstrate 
that CAR-T cells can be engineered to respond robustly to diverse soluble 
ligands, including the CD19 ectodomain, GFP variants, and transforming growth 
factor beta (TGF-Î²). We additionally show that CAR signaling in response to 
soluble ligands relies on ligand-mediated CAR dimerization and that CAR 
responsiveness to soluble ligands can be fine-tuned by adjusting the mechanical 
coupling between the CAR's ligand-binding and signaling domains. Our results 
support a role for mechanotransduction in CAR signaling and demonstrate an 
approach for systematically engineering immune-cell responses to soluble, 
extracellular ligands.
