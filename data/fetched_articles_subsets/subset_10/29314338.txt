BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus-induced wheezing in young children has been associated 
with increased asthma risk at school age. Recently, the transmembrane protein 
cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) was identified as the RV-C receptor and 
the genetic variant rs6967330 (p.Cys529Tyr) was reported to be associated with 
enhanced RV-C binding and increased replication in vitro. The aim of this study 
was to examine rs6967330 genotypes and mRNA expression of CDHR3 in relation to 
presence of rhinovirus and clinical symptoms in children with acute wheezing and 
compare to a group of age-matched healthy children.
METHODS: rs6967330;G>A was genotyped (n = 216), and CDHR3 mRNA expression was 
measured in peripheral blood leukocytes (n = 69) from a subgroup of children 
wheezing with RV infection acute and at a follow-up visit 2-3 months later, and 
in healthy controls. Standardized TaqMan assays were used.
RESULTS: The risk allele rs6967330-A was over-represented in the wheezing group 
(P < .001). Reduced mRNA levels of CDHR3 were found in children with acute 
wheezing as compared to the control group (P = .001). Children with the 
rs6967330 genotypes AA/AG showed the largest differences in CDHR3 expression 
between acute and follow-up visit (P < .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Preschool children with RV-induced wheezing were shown to have 
reduced CDHR3 mRNA levels, which might result in an increased permeability of 
the epithelial layers of the airways and thereby an increased vulnerability. 
Thus, measuring CDHR3 mRNA levels might help to identify a more severe phenotype 
of wheezing preschool children.
