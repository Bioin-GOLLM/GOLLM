Disseminated cryptococcosis has a nearly 70% mortality, mostly attributed to CNS 
infection, with lesser-known effects on other organs. Immune protection against 
Cryptococcus relies on Th1 immunity with M1 polarization, rendering macrophages 
fungicidal. The importance of M1-upregulated inducible NO synthase (iNOS) has 
been documented in pulmonary anticryptococcal defenses, whereas its role in 
disseminated cryptococcosis remains controversial. Here we examined the effect 
of iNOS deletion in disseminated (i.v.) C. deneoformans 52D infection, comparing 
wild-type (C57BL/6J) and iNOS-/- mice. iNOS-/- mice had significantly reduced 
survival and nearly 100-fold increase of the kidney fungal burden, without 
increases in the lungs, spleen, or brain. Histology revealed extensive lesions 
and almost complete destruction of the kidney cortical area with a loss of 
kidney function. The lack of fungal control was not due to a failure to recruit 
immune cells because iNOS-/- mice had increased kidney leukocytes. iNOS-/- mice 
also showed no defect in T cell polarization. We conclude that iNOS is 
critically required for local anticryptococcal defenses in the kidneys, whereas 
it appears to be dispensable in other organs during disseminated infection. This 
study exemplifies a unique phenotype of local immune defenses in the kidneys and 
the organ-specific importance of a single fungicidal pathway.
