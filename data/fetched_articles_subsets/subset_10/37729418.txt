Whether the plant vasculature has the capacity to sense touch is unknown. We 
developed a quantitative assay to investigate touch-response electrical signals 
in the leaves and veins of Arabidopsis thaliana. Mechanostimulated electrical 
signaling in leaves displayed strong diel regulation. Signals of full amplitude 
could be generated by repeated stimulation at the same site after approximately 
90 minutes. However, the signals showed intermediate amplitudes when repeatedly 
stimulated in shorter timeframes. Using intracellular electrodes, we detected 
touch-response membrane depolarizations in the phloem. On the basis of this, we 
mutated multiple Arabidopsis H+-ATPase (AHA) genes expressed in companion cells. 
We found that aha1 aha3 double mutants attenuated touch-responses, and this was 
coupled to growth rate reduction. Moreover, propagating membrane depolarizations 
could be triggered by mechanostimulating the exposed primary vasculature of 
wild-type plants but not of aha1 aha3 mutants. Primary veins have autonomous 
mechanosensory properties which depend on P-type proton pumps.
