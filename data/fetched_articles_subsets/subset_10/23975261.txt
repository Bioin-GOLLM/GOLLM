Whole exome sequencing in two-generational kindred from Bangladesh with early 
onset spasticity, mild intellectual disability, distal amyotrophy, and 
cerebellar atrophy transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait identified the 
following two missense mutations in the EXOSC3 gene: a novel p.V80F mutation and 
a known p.D132A change previously associated with mild variants of 
pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1. This study confirms the involvement of RNA 
processing proteins in disorders with motor neuron and cerebellar degeneration 
overlapping with spinocerebellar ataxia 36 and rare forms of hereditary spastic 
paraplegia with cerebellar features.
