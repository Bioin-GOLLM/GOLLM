BACKGROUND: Drug transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes have been linked to 
drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Solute carrier organic anion transporter family 
member 1B1 (SLCO1B1), cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), and UDP 
glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) were selected as candidate genes to explore 
their association with susceptibility to anti-tuberculosis drug-induced 
hepatotoxicity (ATDH).
METHODS: Thirty-four tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in SLCO1B1, 
CYP2E1, and UGT1A1 with 10-kb expansion up- and down-stream were genotyped in 
461 patients with ATDH and 466 patients without ATDH in a prospective 1:1 
matched case-control study. The frequencies and distributions of genotypes and 
haplotypes were compared between the groups using three genetic models 
(dominant, recessive, and additive) to identify associations with susceptibility 
to ATDH.
RESULTS: Patients with the rs4149034 G/A, rs1564370 G/C, and rs2900478 T/A 
genotypes of SLCO1B1 had a significantly lower risk of ATDH, while those 
carrying the rs2417957 T/T and rs4149063 T/T genotypes had an increased risk. 
The rs4148323 A/A genotype of UGT1A1 was found to significantly reduce the risk 
of ATDH. Haplotype analysis showed the TGTG, TTTC, and GTTC haplotypes of 
SLCO1B1 were associated with an increased ATDH risk, whereas the GACC haplotype 
was related to a reduced risk. The ATG haplotype of UGT1A1 reduced the risk of 
ATDH. Moreover, treatment outcomes in tuberculosis patients were further 
affected by genetic variants of SLCO1B1.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms of SLCO1B1 and UGT1A1 were found to be 
associated with susceptibility to ATDH. Molecular identification of 
susceptibility genes provides a theoretical foundation for predicting the 
likelihood of ATDH and predicting treatment outcomes in tuberculosis patients.
