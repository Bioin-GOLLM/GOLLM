RAC3 is a transcription coactivator, usually overexpressed in several tumors and 
required to maintain the pluripotency in normal stem cells. In this work we 
studied the association between RAC3 overexpression on cancer cell stemness and 
the capacity of this protein to induce cancer stem properties in non tumoral 
cells. We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments using two strategies: by 
overexpressing RAC3 in the non tumoral cell line HEK293 and by silencing RAC3 in 
the human colorectal epithelial cell line HCT116 by transfection. Furthermore, 
we analysed public repository microarrays data from human colorectal tumors in 
different developmental stages. We found that RAC3 overexpression was mainly 
associated to CD133+ side-population of colon cancer cells and also to early and 
advanced stages of colon cancer, involving increased expression of mesenchymal 
and stem markers. In turn, RAC3 silencing induced diminished tumoral properties 
and cancer stem cells as determined by Hoechst efflux, tumorspheres and 
clonogenic growth, which correlated with decreased Nanog and OCT4 expression. In 
non tumoral cells, RAC3 overexpression induced tumoral transformation; 
mesenchymal phenotype and stem markers expression. Moreover, these transformed 
cells generated tumors in vivo. Our results demonstrate that RAC3 is required 
for maintaining and induction of cancer cell stemness.
