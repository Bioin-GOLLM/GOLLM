MOTIVATION: Building reliable phylogenies from very large collections of 
sequences with a limited number of phylogenetically informative sites is 
challenging because sequencing errors and recurrent/backward mutations interfere 
with the phylogenetic signal, confounding true evolutionary relationships. 
Massive global efforts of sequencing genomes and reconstructing the phylogeny of 
SARS-CoV-2 strains exemplify these difficulties since there are only hundreds of 
phylogenetically informative sites and millions of genomes. For such datasets, 
we set out to develop a method for building the phylogenetic tree of genomic 
haplotypes consisting of positions harboring common variants to improve the 
signal-to-noise ratio for more accurate phylogenetic inference of resolvable 
phylogenetic features.
RESULTS: We present the TopHap approach that determines spatiotemporally common 
haplotypes of common variants and builds their phylogeny at a fraction of the 
computational time of traditional methods. To assess topological robustness, we 
develop a bootstrap resampling strategy that resamples genomes spatiotemporally. 
The application of TopHap to build a phylogeny of 68,057 genomes (68KG) produced 
an evolutionary tree of major SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes. This phylogeny is 
concordant with the mutation tree inferred using the co-occurrence pattern of 
mutations and recovers key phylogenetic relationships from more traditional 
analyses. We also evaluated alternative roots of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and 
found that the earliest sampled genomes in 2019 likely evolved by four mutations 
of the most recent common ancestor of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes. An application of 
TopHap to more than 1 million genomes reconstructed the most comprehensive 
evolutionary relationships of major variants, which confirmed the 68KG phylogeny 
and provided evolutionary origins of major variants of concern.
