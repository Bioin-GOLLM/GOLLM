CD8 T cells play essential roles in anti-tumor immune responses. Here, we 
performed genome-scale CRISPR screens in CD8 T cells directly under cancer 
immunotherapy settings and identified regulators of tumor infiltration and 
degranulation. The in vivo screen robustly re-identified canonical immunotherapy 
targets such as PD-1 and Tim-3, along with genes that have not been 
characterized in T cells. The infiltration and degranulation screens converged 
on an RNA helicase Dhx37. Dhx37 knockout enhanced the efficacy of 
antigen-specific CD8 T cells against triple-negative breast cancer in vivo. 
Immunological characterization in mouse and human CD8 T cells revealed that 
DHX37 suppresses effector functions, cytokine production, and T cell activation. 
Transcriptomic profiling and biochemical interrogation revealed a role for DHX37 
in modulating NF-κB. These data demonstrate high-throughput in vivo genetic 
screens for immunotherapy target discovery and establishes DHX37 as a functional 
regulator of CD8 T cells.
