X-linked hydrocephalus is due to mutations in the L1 neuronal cell adhesion 
molecule (L1CAM) gene. L1 protein plays a key role in neurite outgrowth, axonal 
guidance, and pathfinding during the development of the nervous system. We 
report on a familial case diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonographic examination, 
with cerebellar hypoplasia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and the bilateral 
overlapping of the second and third fingers of the hand. Sequencing of the L1CAM 
gene showed a novel missense mutation in exon 14: transition of a guanine to 
cytosine at position 1777 (c.1777G>C), which led to an amino acid change of 
alanine to proline at position 593 (Ala593Pro) in the sixth immunoglobulin 
domain of the L1 protein. The L1CAM mutation testing should be considered in 
fetuses with ultrasonographic signs of hydrocephalus and a positive family 
history compatible with X-linked inheritance. We agree with previous reports 
that suggest also considering limb abnormalities other than adducted thumbs in 
addition to classical neurological disgenesis, as characteristic for L1-disease.
