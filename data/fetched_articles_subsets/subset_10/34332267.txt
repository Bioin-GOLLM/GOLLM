INTRODUCTION: Point mutations in the Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) gene 
comprise less than 5% of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type 1 cases, and 
individualize either the CMT 1E subtype, or Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability 
to Pressure Palsy. The phenotype of CMT 1E presents with a severe early-onset 
polyneuropathy associated with deafness, although the clinical spectrum is 
broad.
CASE REPORT: We describe a novel PMP22 gene point mutation 
(c.84G>T;p.(Trp28Cys)) in three patients of a Portuguese family with variable 
phenotypes, ranging from asymptomatic to mild complaints of distal limb numbness 
and gait difficulties, with the age of onset of symptoms ranging from 
mid-twenties to late-sixties, and no associated disability. In all affected 
patients, there was evidence of diffuse demyelinating sensorimotor 
polyneuropathy. Hearing loss does not seem to be associated with this variant, 
albeit neuropathic pain was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that this particular point mutation in the 
PMP22 gene is associated with a mild phenotype, further emphasizing that there 
are still unknown mechanisms (genetic and/or epigenetic) that may play a role in 
the clinical spectrum of CMT1E patients. Next generation sequencing panels 
including commonly mutated genes in CMT should be considered in CMT1 cases 
negative for PMP22 gene duplication.
