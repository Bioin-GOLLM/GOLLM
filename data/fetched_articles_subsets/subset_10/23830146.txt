BACKGROUND: Combined immunodeficiency with multiple intestinal atresias 
(CID-MIA) is a rare hereditary disease characterized by intestinal obstructions 
and profound immune defects.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the underlying genetic causes of CID-MIA by 
analyzing the exomic sequences of 5 patients and their healthy direct relatives 
from 5 unrelated families.
METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing on 5 patients with CID-MIA and 10 
healthy direct family members belonging to 5 unrelated families with CID-MIA. We 
also performed targeted Sanger sequencing for the candidate gene 
tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A (TTC7A) on 3 additional patients with 
CID-MIA.
RESULTS: Through analysis and comparison of the exomic sequence of the subjects 
from these 5 families, we identified biallelic damaging mutations in the TTC7A 
gene, for a total of 7 distinct mutations. Targeted TTC7A gene sequencing in 3 
additional unrelated patients with CID-MIA revealed biallelic deleterious 
mutations in 2 of them, as well as an aberrant splice product in the third 
patient. Staining of normal thymus showed that the TTC7A protein is expressed in 
thymic epithelial cells, as well as in thymocytes. Moreover, severe lymphoid 
depletion was observed in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid tissues from 2 
patients with CID-MIA.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified deleterious mutations of the TTC7A gene in 8 
unrelated patients with CID-MIA and demonstrated that the TTC7A protein is 
expressed in the thymus. Our results strongly suggest that TTC7A gene defects 
cause CID-MIA.
