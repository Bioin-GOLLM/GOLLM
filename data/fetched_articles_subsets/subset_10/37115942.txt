Despite the wide use of immune checkpoint inhibition for the treatment of 
melanoma, the mechanisms leading to long-term stable disease are incompletely 
understood. Patients with metastatic melanoma who had received ipilimumab alone 
or ipilimumab plus nivolumab 2+years prior and attained at least 6 months of 
stable disease were identified. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography 
(PET/CT) was performed. Pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies of areas of 
stable disease were assessed for tumor, fibrosis, and inflammation. Seven 
patients underwent PET/CT and tissue biopsy. Fluorodeoxyglucose avid lesions on 
PET/CT ranged from no activity to an SUV of 22. In 6 patients, the residual 
stable lesions were composed of necrosis and fibrosis with a prominent pigment 
containing macrophages and no residual melanoma. In 1 patient, a nodal lesion 
demonstrated melanoma with active inflammation. In most patients with durable 
stable disease after treatment with ipilimumab or ipilimumab/nivolumab, residual 
lesions demonstrated predominantly necrosis and fibrosis consistent with 
resolving lesions. The presence of melanophages in these samples may suggest 
ongoing immune surveillance. One patient did demonstrate residual melanoma, 
indicating the need for ongoing monitoring of this patient population.
