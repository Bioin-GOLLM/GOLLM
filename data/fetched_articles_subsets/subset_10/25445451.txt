Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-derived hormone, participates in the 
hormonal bone-parathyroid-kidney axis, which is modulated by PTH, 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, plasma phosphate (Pi), and diet. Inappropriately high 
serum FGF23, seen in certain genetic and acquired disorders, results in urinary 
phosphate wasting and impaired bone mineralization. This study investigated the 
impact of FGF23 gene variation on phosphate homeostasis and bone health. The 
study included 183 children and adolescents (110 girls) aged 7-19 years (median 
13.2years). Urine and blood parameters of calcium and phosphate homeostasis were 
analyzed. Bone characteristics were quantified by DXA and peripheral 
quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Genetic FGF23 variation was assessed by 
direct sequencing of coding exons and flanking intronic regions. Nine FGF23 
polymorphisms were detected; three of them were common: rs3832879 
(c.212-37insC), rs7955866 (c.716C>T, p.T239M) and rs11063112 (c.2185A>T). Four 
different haplotypes and six different diplotypes were observed among these 
three polymorphisms. The variations in FGF23 significantly associated with 
plasma PTH and urinary Pi excretion, even after adjusting for relevant 
covariates. FGF23 variations independently associated with total hip BMD 
Z-score, but not with other bone outcomes. In instrument analysis, genetic 
variance in FGF23 was considered a weak instrument as it only induced small 
variations in circulating FGF23, PTH and Pi concentrations (F statistic less 
than 10). The observed associations between FGF23 variations and circulating 
PTH, and Pi excretion and total hip BMD Z-scores suggest that FGF23 
polymorphisms may play a role in mineral homeostasis and bone metabolism.
