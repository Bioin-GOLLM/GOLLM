BACKGROUND: To assess initial efficacy and feasibility of a structured 
behavioural group training (DELFIN) for parents of children with diabetes type 
1, in order to reduce parenting stress and to improve parenting skills.
METHODS: A randomized controlled study was conducted between July 2008 and 
September 2010, at a children's hospital in Hannover with parents of children 
with type 1 diabetes (2-10 yrs) (intervention group n = 37; control group n = 
28). Parenting skills, parents' psychological burden, children's behavioural 
difficulties and quality of metabolic control were assessed before, 3 months 
after and 12 months after participating in the training program.
RESULTS: In the intervention group parenting behaviour in conflict situations 
improved significantly after 3 months (Z = -3.28; p ≤ 0.001). It remained stable 
over 12 months (Z = -2.94; p ≤ 0.01). Depression and anxiety scores of parents 
decreased (Z = -1.93; p ≤ .05; Z = -2.02; p ≤ .05). Even though the outcome in 
the intervention group was more positive, the differences between both study 
arms failed to reach statistical significance. Unexpectedly parenting behaviour 
in the control group improved also (Z = -2.45; p ≤ .05). Anxiety as well as 
stress scores decreased in this group (Z = -2.02; p ≤ .05 and Z = -2.11; p ≤ 
.05). In both groups the initial metabolic control was good and without 
significant differences (A1c 7.2 ± 0.8% vs. 7.1 ± 0.4%; p > 0.5). It remained 
stable in the DELFIN group (A1c 7.1 ± 0.8%; p > 0.5), but it increased slightly 
in controls (A1c 7.3 ± 0.5%; Z = -2.79; p = .005).
CONCLUSIONS: This study has brought first evidence for the efficacy and 
feasibility of the program. A multicentre study with a larger sample is 
necessary to confirm these first results.
