Fragments of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) are major components of 
intracellular aggregates associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
frontotemporal dementia. A variety of C-terminal fragments (CTFs) exist, with 
distinct N termini; however, little is known regarding their differences in 
metabolism and aggregation dynamics. Previously, we found that specific CTFs 
accumulate in the absence of the Arg/N-end rule pathway of the ubiquitin 
proteasome system (UPS) and that their degradation requires arginyl-tRNA protein 
transferase 1 (ATE1). Here, we examined two specific CTFs of TDP43 (TDP43219 and 
TDP43247), which are ∼85% identical and differ at their N termini by 28 amino 
acids. We found that TDP43247 is degraded primarily by the Arg/N-end rule 
pathway, whereas degradation of TDP43219 continues in the absence of ATE1. These 
fragments also differ in their aggregation propensities and form morphologically 
distinct aggregates. This work reveals that the N termini of otherwise similar 
CTFs have profound effects on fragment behavior and may influence clinical 
outcomes in neurodegeneration associated with aggregation.
