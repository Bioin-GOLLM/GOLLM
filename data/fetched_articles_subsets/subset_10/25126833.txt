Antagonist and partial agonist modulators of the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) have 
emerged as promising therapeutics for the treatment of substance abuse and 
neuropsychiatric disorders. However, development of druglike lead compounds with 
selectivity for the D3 receptor has been challenging because of the high 
sequence homology between the D3R and the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). In this 
effort, we synthesized a series of acylaminobutylpiperazines incorporating 
aza-aromatic units and evaluated their binding and functional activities at the 
D3 and D2 receptors. Docking studies and results from evaluations against a set 
of chimeric and mutant receptors suggest that interactions at the extracellular 
end of TM7 contribute to the D3R versus D2R selectivity of these ligands. 
Molecular insights from this study could potentially enable rational design of 
potent and selective D3R ligands.
