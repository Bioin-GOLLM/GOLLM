Intense ultraviolet (UV) exposure can cause phototoxic reactions, such as skin 
inflammation, resulting in injury. UV is a direct cause of DNA damage, but the 
mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation within cells after DNA damage 
are unclear. The bioinformatics analysis of transcriptome sequencing data from 
UV-irradiated and non-UV-irradiated skin showed that transcription-related 
proteins, such as HSF4 and COIL, mediate cellular response to UV irradiation. 
HSF4 and COIL can form a complex under UV irradiation, and the preference for 
binding target genes changed because of the presence of a large number of 
R-loops in cells under UV irradiation and the ability of COIL to recognize 
R-loops. The regulation of target genes was altered by the HSF4-COIL complex, 
and the expression of inflammation and ageing-related genes, such as Atg7, Tfpi, 
and Lims1, was enhanced. A drug screen was performed for the recognition sites 
of COIL and R-loop. N6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-adenosine can competitively bind COIL 
and inhibit the binding of COIL to the R-loop. Thus, the activation of 
downstream inflammation-related genes and inflammatory skin injury was 
inhibited.
