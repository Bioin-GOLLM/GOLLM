Crossover recombination is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during 
meiosis. The MutSγ complex, Msh4-Msh5, facilitates crossing over by binding and 
stabilizing nascent recombination intermediates. We show that these activities 
are governed by regulated proteolysis. MutSγ is initially inactive for crossing 
over due to an N-terminal degron on Msh4 that renders it unstable by directly 
targeting proteasomal degradation. Activation of MutSγ requires the 
Dbf4-dependent kinase Cdc7 (DDK), which directly phosphorylates and thereby 
neutralizes the Msh4 degron. Genetic requirements for Msh4 phosphorylation 
indicate that DDK targets MutSγ only after it has bound to nascent joint 
molecules (JMs) in the context of synapsing chromosomes. Overexpression studies 
confirm that the steady-state level of Msh4, not phosphorylation per se, is the 
critical determinant for crossing over. At the DNA level, Msh4 phosphorylation 
enables the formation and crossover-biased resolution of double-Holliday 
Junction intermediates. Our study establishes regulated protein degradation as a 
fundamental mechanism underlying meiotic crossing over.
