In humans, large conductance voltage- and calcium-dependent potassium (BK) 
channels are regulated allosterically by transmembrane voltage and intracellular 
Ca2+. Divalent cation binding sites reside within the gating ring formed by two 
Regulator of Conductance of Potassium (RCK) domains per subunit. Using 
patch-clamp fluorometry, we show that Ca2+ binding to the RCK1 domain triggers 
gating ring rearrangements that depend on transmembrane voltage. Because the 
gating ring is outside the electric field, this voltage sensitivity must 
originate from coupling to the voltage-dependent channel opening, the voltage 
sensor or both. Here we demonstrate that alterations of the voltage sensor, 
either by mutagenesis or regulation by auxiliary subunits, are paralleled by 
changes in the voltage dependence of the gating ring movements, whereas 
modifications of the relative open probability are not. These results strongly 
suggest that conformational changes of RCK1 domains are specifically coupled to 
the voltage sensor function during allosteric modulation of BK channels.
