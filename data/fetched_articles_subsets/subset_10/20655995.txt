Comparison of paralogous vitellogenins in 10 insect species representing six 
orders showed a remarkable degree of conservation of amino acid composition in 
spite of sequence differences. For example, the correlation between the 
percentages of the 20 amino acids in two vitellogenins from the beetle Tribolium 
castaneum was 0.975, even though the two amino acid sequences differed from each 
other at 49.4% of sites. There was a positive correlation between the frequency 
of occurrence of reciprocal pairs of amino acids in more distantly related 
paralogs, and this correlation was generally strongest when both of the amino 
acids in the pair were nutritionally essential. These results imply that 
conservation of amino acid composition occurs through amino acid replacements 
that result in a balanced loss and gain of each amino acid residue. Thus insect 
vitellogenins seem to be subject to an unusual kind of purifying selection, 
where the amino acid content is conserved rather than the sequence per se, 
selection apparently arising from the nutritional needs of the developing embryo 
appears to be responsible for maintaining the balance of amino acids.
