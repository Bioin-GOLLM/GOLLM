Prenatal organophosphate pesticide (OP) exposure was reported to negatively 
affect childhood neurodevelopment. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a key enzyme in the 
metabolism of OPs and may affect an individual's susceptibility to OP exposure. 
However, little is known about its role in the associations of prenatal OP 
exposure and childhood neurodevelopment. We measured dimethylphosphate (DM), 
diethylphosphate (DE), and total dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites in maternal 
urine (n = 436) as well as PON1-108C/T and PON1192Q/R genotypes in maternal 
blood (n = 244). We assessed the modifying effects of maternal PON1-108C/T and 
PON1192Q/R genotypes on relationships between prenatal OP exposure and 
developmental quotients (DQs) in 24-month-old children in Shandong, China (n = 
172). Among children of mothers carrying PON1-108CC, a tenfold increase in 
prenatal DMs was associated with a 5.72-point decrease in social domain DQ 
scores. Among children of mothers carrying PON1192QQ, a tenfold increase in 
prenatal DMs and DAPs were associated with a 7.68- and 7.67-point decrease in 
gross motor domain DQ scores, respectively. Among children of mothers carrying 
PON1192QQ, a tenfold increase in prenatal DMs, DEs, and DAPs were associated 
with a 7.52-, 9.07-, and 9.60-point decrease in social domain DQ scores, 
respectively. Maternal PON1 genotype might modify the associations between 
prenatal OP exposure and children's neurodevelopment at 24 months of age.
