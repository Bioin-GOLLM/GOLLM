Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can undergo post-translational 
modifications, including phosphorylation, glycosylation and ubiquitylation, 
leading to diverse physiological consequences and modulation of its biological 
activity. There is increasing evidence that methylation may parallel other 
post-translational modifications in the regulation of various biological 
processes. It is still not known, however, whether EGFR is regulated by this 
post-translational event. Here, we show that EGFR Arg 1175 is methylated by an 
arginine methyltransferase, PRMT5. Arg 1175 methylation positively modulates 
EGF-induced EGFR trans-autophosphorylation at Tyr 1173, which governs ERK 
activation. Abolishment of Arg 1175 methylation enhances EGF-stimulated ERK 
activation by reducing SHP1 recruitment to EGFR, resulting in augmented cell 
proliferation, migration and invasion of EGFR-expressing cells. Therefore, we 
propose a model in which the regulatory crosstalk between PRMT5-mediated 
Arg 1175 methylation and EGF-induced Tyr 1173 phosphorylation attenuates 
EGFR-mediated ERK activation.
