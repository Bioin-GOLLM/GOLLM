OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a complex disorder and is linked to chronic diseases such 
as type 2 diabetes. Major intrinsically disordered NOTCH2-associated receptor2 
(MINAR2) is an understudied protein with an unknown role in obesity and 
metabolism. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of Minar2 on 
adipose tissues and obesity.
METHOD: We generated Minar2 knockout (KO) mice and used various molecular, 
proteomic, biochemical, histopathology, and cell culture studies to determine 
the pathophysiological role of Minar2 in adipocytes.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that the inactivation of Minar2 results in increased 
body fat with hypertrophic adipocytes. Minar2 KO mice on a high-fat diet develop 
obesity and impaired glucose tolerance and metabolism. Mechanistically, Minar2 
interacts with Raptor, a specific and essential component of mammalian TOR 
complex 1 (mTORC1) and inhibits mTOR activation. mTOR is hyperactivated in the 
adipocytes deficient for Minar2 and over-expression of Minar2 in HEK-293 cells 
inhibited mTOR activation and phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates, including S6 
kinase, and 4E-BP1.
CONCLUSION: Our findings identified Minar2 as a novel physiological negative 
regulator of mTORC1 with a key role in obesity and metabolic disorders. Impaired 
expression or activation of MINAR2 could lead to obesity and obesity-associated 
diseases.
