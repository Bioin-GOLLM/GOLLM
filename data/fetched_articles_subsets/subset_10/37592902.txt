BACKGROUND: Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) composed of more than 20 carbon 
atoms are essential in the biosynthesis of cell membranes in the brain, skin, 
and retina. VLCFAs are elongated beyond 28 carbon atoms by ELOVL4 enzyme. 
Variants in ELOVL4 are associated with three Mendelian disorders: autosomal 
dominant (AD) Stargardt-like macular dystrophy type 3, AD spinocerebellar 
ataxia, and autosomal recessive disorder congenital ichthyosis, spastic 
quadriplegia and impaired intellectual development (ISQMR). Only seven subjects 
from five unrelated families with ISQMR have been described, all of which have 
biallelic single-nucleotide variants.
METHODS: We performed clinical exome sequencing on probands from four unrelated 
families with neuro-ichthyosis.
RESULTS: We identified three novel homozygous ELOVL4 variants. Two of the 
families originated from the same Saudi tribe and had the exact homozygous 
exonic deletion in ELOVL4, while the third and fourth probands had two different 
novel homozygous missense variants. Seven out of the eight affected subjects had 
profound developmental delay, epilepsy, axial hypotonia, peripheral hypertonia, 
and ichthyosis. Delayed myelination and corpus callosum hypoplasia were seen in 
two of five subjects with brain magnetic rosonance imaging and cerebral atrophy 
in three.
CONCLUSION: Our study expands the allelic spectrum of ELOVL4-related ISQMR. The 
detection of the same exonic deletion in two unrelated Saudi family from same 
tribe suggests a tribal founder mutation.
