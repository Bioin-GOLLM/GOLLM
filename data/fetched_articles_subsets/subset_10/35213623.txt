BACKGROUND: Serum fructosamine is a routine test used for clinical monitoring of 
diabetes mellitus (DM) but the usefulness of HbA1c for this purpose has not been 
extensively studied.
HYPOTHESIS: The study aimed to compare the ability of blood HbA1c and serum 
fructosamine tests to correctly classify DM control determined using a 
clinically-based assessment.
ANIMALS: 28 client-owned dogs with naturally-occurring diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study. Ability of fructosamine and HbA1c 
tests to classify diabetes control in dogs was determined.
RESULTS: Clinical assessment classified 50% of dogs as having good diabetic 
control and 82% as having acceptable diabetic control. Analysis using Cohen's 
kappa test showed that agreements between fructosamine and HbA1c results and the 
clinical assessment ranged from poor to fair. Fructosamine and HbA1c results 
from each dog showed a moderate correlation. Overall, the HbA1c test showed the 
best agreement with the clinical assessment when diabetes control was considered 
either acceptable or unacceptable, although the strength of agreement was 
considered fair (kappa = 0.27).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The HbA1c concentration was found to be 
more consistent with clinical evaluation of diabetes control than was the serum 
fructosamine concentration. The HbA1c level is a useful tool for assessment of 
glycemic status in diabetic dogs but should be used alongside other tests for 
outpatient monitoring of clinically stable diabetic dogs.
