Primary prostate cancer can have extensive microheterogeneity, but its 
contribution to the later emergence of metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (mCRPC) remains unclear. In this study, we microdissected residual 
prostate cancer foci in radical prostatectomies from 18 men treated with 
neoadjuvant-intensive androgen deprivation therapy (leuprolide, abiraterone 
acetate, and prednisone) and analyzed them for resistance mechanisms. 
Transcriptome profiling showed reduced but persistent androgen receptor (AR) 
activity in residual tumors, with no increase in neuroendocrine differentiation. 
Proliferation correlated negatively with AR activity but positively with 
decreased RB1 expression, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) further showed 
enrichment for RB1 genomic loss. In 15 cases where 2 or 3 tumor foci were 
microdissected, WES confirmed a common clonal origin but identified multiple 
oncogenic alterations unique to each focus. These findings show that subclones 
with oncogenic alterations found in mCRPC are present in primary prostate cancer 
and are selected for by neoadjuvant-intense androgen deprivation therapy. In 
particular, this study indicates that subclonal RB1 loss may be more common than 
previously appreciated in intermediate- to high-risk primary prostate cancer and 
may be an early event, independent of neuroendocrine differentiation, in the 
development of mCRPC. Comprehensive molecular analyses of primary prostate 
cancer may detect aggressive subclones and possibly inform adjuvant strategies 
to prevent recurrence.Significance: Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for 
prostate cancer selects for tumor foci with subclonal genomic alterations, which 
may comprise the origin of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
