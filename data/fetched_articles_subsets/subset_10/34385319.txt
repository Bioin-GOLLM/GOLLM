The protein kinase Akt is one of the primary effectors of growth factor 
signaling in the cell. Akt responds specifically to the lipid second messengers 
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] and 
phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2] via its PH domain, leading to 
phosphorylation of its activation loop and the hydrophobic motif of its kinase 
domain, which are critical for activity. We have now determined the crystal 
structure of Akt1, revealing an autoinhibitory interface between the PH and 
kinase domains that is often mutated in cancer and overgrowth disorders. This 
interface persists even after stoichiometric phosphorylation, thereby 
restricting maximum Akt activity to PI(3,4,5)P3- or PI(3,4)P2-containing 
membranes. Our work helps to resolve the roles of lipids and phosphorylation in 
the activation of Akt and has wide implications for the spatiotemporal control 
of Akt and potentially lipid-activated kinase signaling in general.
