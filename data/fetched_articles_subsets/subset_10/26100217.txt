INTRODUCTION: The deletion in the CCR5 gene (CCR5Δ32), the HLA-B*27:05, and 
polymorphisms rs2395029 and rs9264942 have been associated with slower 
progression of HIV-1.
METHODS: An analysis was performed on 408 patients on follow-up. The analysis of 
viral load, CD4+ Tlymphocytes and other clinical variables since the diagnosis 
of the infection were collected.
RESULTS: The prevalence of the genetic markers rs9264942, CCR5wt/Δ32, rs2395029, 
HLA-B*27:05 was 17.9%, 11.5%, 7.6%, and 6.4%, respectively. Of all the patients, 
354 were classified as progressors and 46 as long-term non-progressors (LTNPs). 
Except for the HLA-B*27:05 allele, other genetic markers were associated with 
slower progression: CCR5wt/Δ32 (P=.011) and SNPs rs2395029 and rs9264942 
(P<.0001), as well as their association (P<.0001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of the HLA-B*57:01 allele was higher than described 
nationally. No association could be found between the HLA-B*27:05 allele and the 
presence of slower disease progression.
