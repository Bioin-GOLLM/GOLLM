OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of APOE polymorphisms on cognitive performance 
in patients newly diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or 
relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).
METHODS: This multicenter cohort study included 552 untreated patients recently 
diagnosed with CIS or RRMS according to the 2005 revised McDonald criteria. The 
single nucleotide polymorphisms rs429358 (ε4) and rs7412 (ε2) of the APOE 
haplotype were assessed by allelic discrimination assays. Cognitive performance 
was evaluated using the 3-second paced auditory serial addition test and the 
Multiple Sclerosis Inventory Cognition (MUSIC). Sum scores were calculated to 
approximate the overall cognitive performance and memory-centered cognitive 
functions. The impact of the APOE carrier status on cognitive performance was 
assessed using multiple linear regression models, also including demographic, 
clinical, MRI, and lifestyle factors.
RESULTS: APOE ε4 homozygosity was associated with lower overall cognitive 
performance, whereas no relevant association was observed for APOE ε4 
heterozygosity or APOE ε2 carrier status. Furthermore, higher disability levels, 
MRI lesion load, and depressive symptoms were associated with lower cognitive 
performance. Patients consuming alcohol had higher test scores than patients not 
consuming alcohol. Female sex, lower disability, and alcohol consumption were 
associated with better performance in the memory-centered subtests of MUSIC, 
whereas no relevant association was observed for APOE carrier status.
CONCLUSION: Along with parameters of a higher disease burden, APOE ε4 
homozygosity was identified as a potential predictor of cognitive performance in 
this large cohort of patients with CIS and early RRMS.
