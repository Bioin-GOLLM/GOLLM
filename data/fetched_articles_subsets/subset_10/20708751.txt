BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial diseases due to mitochondrial tRNA genes mutations are 
usually multisystem disorders with infantile or adult onset.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the molecular defect underlying a mitochondrial 
encephalomyopathy.
METHODS/PATIENTS: Case report of a 51year-old woman presenting with late-onset 
myoclonic epilepsy plus additional features. Proband's mother presented 
hypothyroidism and diabetes.
RESULTS: Muscle biopsy showed mitochondrial changes. Respiratory chain 
activities were reduced. The novel G5538A mutation was identified in different 
tissues DNAs from the proband and from her mother.
CONCLUSION: We were able to identify a novel mtDNA tRNA((Trp)) gene pathogenic 
mutation.
