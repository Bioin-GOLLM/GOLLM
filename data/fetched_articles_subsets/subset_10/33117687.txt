Receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a multiligand binding and 
single-pass transmembrane protein taken in diverse chronic inflammatory 
conditions. RAGE behaves as a pattern recognition receptor, which binds and is 
engaged in the cellular response to a variety of damage-associated molecular 
pattern molecules, as well as HMGB1, S100 proteins, and AGEs (advanced glycation 
end-products). The RAGE activation turns out to a formation of numerous 
intracellular signaling mechanisms, resulting in the progression and 
prolongation of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The RAGE expression correlates well 
with the survival of colon cancer cells. RAGE is involved in the tumorigenesis, 
which increases and develops well in the stressed tumor microenvironment. In 
this review, we summarized downstream signaling cascade activated by the 
multiligand activation of RAGE, as well as RAGE ligands and their sources, 
clinical studies, and tumor markers related to RAGE particularly in the 
inflammatory tumor microenvironment in CRC. Furthermore, the role of RAGE 
signaling pathway in CRC patients with diabetic mellitus is investigated. RAGE 
has been reported to drive assorted signaling pathways, including activator 
protein 1, nuclear factor-κB, signal transducer and activator of transcription 
3, SMAD family member 4 (Smad4), mitogen-activated protein kinases, mammalian 
target of rapamycin, phosphoinositide 3-kinases, reticular activating system, 
Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and Glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and even microRNAs.
