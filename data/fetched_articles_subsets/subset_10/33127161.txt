INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE: Indoleamine 2, 3- dioxygenase (IDO) plays an 
importantrole in immunosuppressive pathway, as inhibits responsesof T cells and 
promotes immune tolerance. Host responsetoHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is 
involved in the infection persistenceand it is also associatedwith different 
clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of IDO in 
H. pylori-infected patients with gastritis diseases and peptic ulcer diseases 
(PUD) through the assessment of the relationship among IDO protein expression 
and the numbers of T helper (Th)-1, Th17, Th22, and T regulator (Treg) cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antrum biopsy was obtained from H. pylori-negative 
patients (n = 48) and H. pylori-positive subjects (55 patients with gastritis 
and 47 patients with PUD), for performing H. pylori status and histopathological 
assessments. IDO protein expression was evaluated by Western blotting.
RESULTS: IDO protein expression was significantly higher in gastric biopsies 
from H. pylori-positive subjects compared to the H. pylori-negative subjects, 
and also in H. pylori-positive subjects with gastritis disease compared to H. 
pylori-positive subjects with PUD. Moreover, in H. pylori-positive subjects, a 
positive correlation was observed between IDO protein expression and the 
frequency of Treg cells. In addition, a negative correlation was observed 
between IDO protein expression and the number of Th1, Th17, and Th22.
CONCLUSION: Increased IDO protein expression is able to change the number of 
Th1, Th17, Th22, and Treg cells and these changes are possibly associated with 
an increase in the risk of PUD development in H. pylori-infected patients.
