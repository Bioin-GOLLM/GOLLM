BACKGROUND: The early identification of individuals at high risk for adverse 
outcomes by a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) in resource-limited 
primary care settings enables tailored treatments, however, the evidence 
concerning its benefits are still controversial. The main objective of this 
study was to examine the validity and reliability of the "Multidimensional 
Assessment of Older People in Primary Care (AMPI-AB)", a CGA for primary care in 
resource-limited settings.
METHODS: Longitudinal study, with median follow-up time of 16 months. Older 
adults from a public primary care unit in São Paulo, Brazil, were consecutively 
admitted. Reliability was tested in a sample from a public geriatric outpatient 
clinic. Participants were classified by the AMPI-AB score as requiring a low, 
intermediate or high complexity of care. The Physical Frailty Phenotype was used 
to explore the AMPI-AB's concurrent validity. Predictive validity was assessed 
with mortality, worsening of the functional status, hospitalizations, emergency 
room (ER) visits and falls. The area under the ROC curve and logistic regression 
were calculated for binary outcomes, and a Cox proportional hazards model was 
used for survival analysis.
RESULTS: Older adults (n = 317) with a median age of 80 (74-86) years, 67% 
female, were consecutively admitted. At the follow-up, 7.1% of participants had 
died, and increased dependency on basic and instrumental activities of daily 
living was detected in 8.9 and 41.1% of the participants, respectively. The 
AMPI-AB score was accurate in detecting frailty (area under the ROC 
curve = 0.851), predicted mortality (HR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.13-1.39) and increased 
dependency on basic (OR = 1.26, 95%CI = 1.10-1.46) and instrumental (OR = 1.22, 
95%CI = 1.12-1.34) activities of daily living, hospitalizations (OR = 2.05, 
95%CI = 1.04-1.26), ER visits (OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.10-1.31) and falls 
(OR = 1.10, 95%CI = 1.01-1.20), all models adjusted for sex and years of 
schooling. Reliability was tested in a sample of 52 older adults with a median 
age of 72 (85-64) years, 63.5% female. The AMPI-AB also had good interrater 
(ICC = 0.87, 95%CI = 0.78-0.92), test-retest (ICC = 0.86, 95%CI = 0.76-0.93) and 
proxy reliability (ICC = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.67-0.93). The Cronbach's alpha was 
0.69, and the mean AMPI-AB administration time was 05:44 ± 02:42 min.
CONCLUSION: The AMPI-AB is a valid and reliable tool for managing older adults 
in resource-limited primary care settings.
