Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is believed to be crucial for primary 
tumors to escape their original residence and invade and metastasize. To 
properly define EMT, there is a need for ligands that can identify this 
phenomenon in tumor tissue and invivo. A phage-display selection screening was 
performed to select novel binding phage peptides for identification of EMT in 
breast cancer. Epithelial breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 was transformed to 
mesenchymal phenotype by TGF-β treatment and was used for selection. Breast 
fibroblasts were used for subtractive depletion and breast cancer metastatic 
cell lines MDA-MB-231, T47D-shNMI were used for specificity assay. The binding 
peptides were identified, and their binding capacities were confirmed by phage 
capture assay, phage-based ELISA, immunofluorescence microscopy. The phage 
peptide bearing the 7-amino acid sequence, LGLRGSL, demonstrated selective 
binding to EMT phenotypic cells (MCF-7/TGF-β and MDA-MB-231) as compared to 
epithelial subtype, MCF-7, T47D and breast fibroblasts (Hs578T). The selected 
phage was also able to identify metastatic breast cancer tumor in breast cancer 
tissue microarray (TMA). These studies suggest that the selected phage peptide 
LGLRGSL identified by phage-display library, showed significant ability to bind 
to mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells/ tissues and can serve as a novel 
probe/ligand for metastatic breast cancer diagnostic and imaging.
