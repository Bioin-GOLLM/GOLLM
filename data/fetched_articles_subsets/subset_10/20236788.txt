OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether smoking cessation 
improves flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery.
BACKGROUND: The long-term effects of continued smoking and smoking cessation on 
endothelial function have not been described previously.
METHODS: This was a 1-year, prospective, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled clinical trial of the effects of 5 smoking cessation 
pharmacotherapies. FMD was measured by B-mode ultrasonography before and 1 year 
after the target smoking cessation date. Cessation was verified by exhaled 
carbon monoxide levels. DeltaFMD was compared among study arms and between 
subjects who successfully quit smoking and those who continued to smoke. 
Predictors of baseline FMD and DeltaFMD were identified by multivariable 
regression.
RESULTS: The 1,504 current smokers (58% female, 84% white) were 44.7 +/- 11.1 
years of age and smoked 21.4 +/- 8.9 cigarettes/day. Baseline FMD was similar in 
each treatment arm (p = 0.499) and was predicted by BA diameter (p < 0.001), 
reactive hyperemia blood flow (p < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(p = 0.001), and carbon monoxide (p = 0.012) levels. After 1 year, 36.2% quit 
smoking. FMD increased by 1% (6.2 +/- 4.4% to 7.2 +/- 4.2%) after 1 year (p = 
0.005) in those who quit, but did not change (p = 0.643) in those who continued 
to smoke. Improved FMD among quitters remained significant (p = 0.010) after 
controlling for changes in brachial artery diameter, reactive hyperemia, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the presence of a home smoking ban.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite weight gain, smoking cessation leads to prolonged 
improvements in endothelial function, which may mediate part of the reduced 
cardiovascular disease risk observed after smoking cessation. (Smoking Cessation
