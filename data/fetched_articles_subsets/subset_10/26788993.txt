Protein phosphorylation on tyrosine (Tyr) residues has evolved as an important 
mechanism to coordinate cell communication in multicellular organisms. The 
importance of this process has been revealed by the discovery of the prominent 
oncogenic properties of tyrosine kinases (TK) upon deregulation of their 
physiological activities, often due to protein overexpression and/or somatic 
mutation. Recent reports suggest that TK oncogenic signaling is also under the 
control of small adaptor proteins. These cytosolic proteins lack intrinsic 
catalytic activity and signal by linking two functional members of a catalytic 
pathway. While most adaptors display positive regulatory functions, a small 
group of this family exerts negative regulatory functions by targeting several 
components of the TK signaling cascade. Here, we review how these less studied 
adaptor proteins negatively control TK activities and how their loss of function 
induces abnormal TK signaling, promoting tumor formation. We also discuss the 
therapeutic consequences of this novel regulatory mechanism in human oncology.
