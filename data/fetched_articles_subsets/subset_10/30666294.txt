Pheochromocytomas have been shown to impair glucose tolerance and, rarely, to 
precipitate overt diabetes mellitus. We report here a case of a large 
pheochromocytoma in a woman with a recent diagnosis of diabetes mellitus that 
proved difficult to control despite high-dose insulin therapy who had complete 
resolution of her hyperglycemia following adrenalectomy. Her dramatic 
presentation demonstrates the need to consider this etiology in patients with 
new-onset insulin resistance and hypertension.
