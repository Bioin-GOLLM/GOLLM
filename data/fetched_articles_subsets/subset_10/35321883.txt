The BCR comprises a membrane-bound Ig that is noncovalently associated with a 
heterodimer of CD79A and CD79B. While the BCR Ig component functions to sense 
extracellular Ag, CD79 subunits contain cytoplasmic ITAMs that mediate 
intracellular propagation of BCR signals critical for B cell development, 
survival, and Ag-induced activation. CD79 is therefore an attractive target for 
Ab and chimeric Ag receptor T cell therapies for autoimmunity and B cell 
neoplasia. Although the mouse is an attractive model for preclinical testing, 
due to its well-defined immune system, an obstacle is the lack of 
cross-reactivity of candidate therapeutic anti-human mAbs with mouse CD79. To 
overcome this problem, we generated knockin mice in which the extracellular 
Ig-like domains of CD79A and CD79B were replaced with human equivalents. In this 
study, we describe the generation and characterization of mice expressing 
chimeric CD79 and report studies that demonstrate their utility in preclinical 
analysis of anti-human CD79 therapy. We demonstrate that human and mouse CD79 
extracellular domains are functionally interchangeable, and that anti-human CD79 
lacking Fc region effector function does not cause significant B cell depletion, 
but induces 1) decreased expression of plasma membrane-associated IgM and IgD, 
2) uncoupling of BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium mobilization, 
and 3) increased expression of PTEN, consistent with the levels observed in 
anergic B cells. Finally, anti-human CD79 treatment prevents disease development 
in two mouse models of autoimmunity. We also present evidence that anti-human 
CD79 treatment may inhibit Ab secretion by terminally differentiated 
plasmablasts and plasma cells in vitro.
