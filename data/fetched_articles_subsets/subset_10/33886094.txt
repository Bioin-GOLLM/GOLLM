N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on chromosome-associated regulatory RNAs (carRNAs), 
including repeat RNAs, plays important roles in tuning the chromatin state and 
transcription, but the intrinsic mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that 
YTHDC1 plays indispensable roles in the self-renewal and differentiation potency 
of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which highly depends on the m6A-binding 
ability. Ythdc1 is required for sufficient rRNA synthesis and repression of the 
2-cell (2C) transcriptional program in ESCs, which recapitulates the 
transcriptome regulation by the LINE1 scaffold. Detailed analyses revealed that 
YTHDC1 recognizes m6A on LINE1 RNAs in the nucleus and regulates the formation 
of the LINE1-NCL partnership and the chromatin recruitment of KAP1. Moreover, 
the establishment of H3K9me3 on 2C-related retrotransposons is interrupted in 
Ythdc1-depleted ESCs and inner cell mass (ICM) cells, which consequently 
increases the transcriptional activities. Our study reveals a role of m6A in 
regulating the RNA scaffold, providing a new model for the RNA-chromatin 
cross-talk.
