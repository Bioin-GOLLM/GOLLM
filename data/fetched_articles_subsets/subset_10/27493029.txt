COQ2 (p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyl transferase) encodes the enzyme required for 
the second step of the final reaction sequence of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) 
biosynthesis. Its mutations represent a frequent cause of primary CoQ deficiency 
and have been associated with the widest clinical spectrum, ranging from fatal 
neonatal multisystemic disease to late-onset encephalopathy. However, the 
reasons of this variability are still unknown.We have characterized the 
structure of human COQ2, defined its subcellular localization and developed a 
yeast model to validate all the mutant alleles reported so far.Our findings show 
that the main functional transcript of COQ2 is shorter than what was previously 
reported and that its protein product localizes to mitochondria with the 
C-terminus facing the intermembrane space. Complementation experiments in yeast 
showed that the residual activity of the mutant proteins correlates with the 
clinical phenotypes observed in patients.We defined the structure of COQ2 with 
relevant implications for mutation screening in patients and demonstrated that, 
contrary to other COQ gene defects such as ADCK3, there is a correlation between 
COQ2 genotype and patient's phenotype.
