The midbrain dopamine system via the dorsal and ventral striatum regulates a 
wide range of behaviors. To dissect the role of dopaminergic projections to the 
dorsal striatum (nigrostriatal projection) and ventral striatum (mesolimbic 
projection) in sleep-wake behavior, we selectively chemogenetically stimulated 
nigrostriatal or mesolimbic projections and examined the resulting effects on 
sleep in rats. Stimulation of nigrostriatal pathways increased sleep and EEG 
delta power, while stimulation of mesolimbic pathways decreased sleep and 
reduced cortical EEG power. These results indicate that midbrain dopamine 
signaling in the dorsal or ventral striatum promotes sleep or wake, 
respectively.
