The evolutionary conservation of T lymphocyte subsets bearing αβ TCRs using 
invariant α-chains is indicative of unique and important functions. Among these 
T lymphocytes, NKT cells that express an invariant TCRα-chain and recognize 
lipid Ags presented by the nonclassical MHC class I molecule CD1d are probably 
the most studied. However, a new population of evolutionarily conserved T cells 
with another invariant TCRα rearrangement was recently characterized. These 
cells, which are very abundant in humans, tend to reside in mucosal tissues and, 
therefore, were named mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Until 
recently, little was known about MAIT cells; however, several recent advances in 
our understanding of MAIT cell characteristics and functions secure their 
upcoming rise to fame in the immunology field and in clinical practice.
