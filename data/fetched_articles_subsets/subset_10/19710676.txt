OBJECTIVE: To describe prostanoid DP receptor (PTGDR) variants in women with 
preterm births who admitted to coital activity (CA) within 24 h of labor.
STUDY DESIGN: To achieve >80% statistical power, a pilot case-control study 
compared 24 premature births from mothers with CA (Group 1), 30 mothers of 
premature infants who did not have CA (Group 2 non-coital activity) and 95 
non-coital activity mothers with term births (Group 3 controls). Four functional 
PTDGR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated: T-549C, C-441/T, 
T-197C and G+1044A. PHASE 2.0.2 and SAS 9.2 were used for analysis.
RESULT: All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls. The C-441/T 
genotype frequency was significantly increased among Group 1 women relative to 
Group 2 and 3 women (odds ratio (OR): 30.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.9-191 
and 25.7 95%CI 25.7-not computible, respectively). Of the possible haplotypes 
among the groups, the TCTG haplotype (T-549C, C-441/T, T-197C and G+1044A) was 
significantly more frequent in Group 1 women compared with the control groups 
(OR 53.4, 95%CI 10.3-554.8).
CONCLUSIONS: A differential genomic pattern of PTGDR polymorphisms was 
identified in a sub-set of mothers which was associated with an increased risk 
of post-coital preterm birth.
