OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of aquagenic wrinkling of the palms (AWP) 
in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared with control patients, and 
evaluate for genotype-phenotype correlations. Since its first description over 
30 years ago, AWP has frequently been anecdotally associated with CF, but this 
association has not been confirmed in a rigorous prospective case-control study.
DESIGN: Blinded comparison.
SETTING: The CF and dermatology clinics at St Louis Children's Hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-four individuals with CF from a CF clinic and 26 controls 
from a dermatology clinic. Intervention Participants were tested for AWP using 3 
minutes of water immersion with room-temperature tap water. Main Outcome Measure 
The degree of AWP was scored from 0 (no wrinkling) to 4 (severe wrinkling) by 3 
blinded physicians. For genotype-phenotype correlations, patients with CF were 
divided into those homozygous for the DeltaF508 mutation and those with other 
genotypes.
RESULTS: The mean AWP score of the CF group was significantly higher than the 
mean score of the control group (1.5 vs 0.6; P < .001). Patients with CF who 
were homozygous for the DeltaF508 mutation (n = 27) had significantly higher 
scores than patients with CF who were not homozygous for the DeltaF508 mutation 
(n = 17) (1.7 vs 1.1; P = .02). The 17 patients with CF who were not homozygous 
for the DeltaF508 mutation still had higher scores than the control group (1.1 
vs 0.6; P = .03). There was no correlation between sweat chloride concentrations 
measured at the time of diagnosis and AWP score.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the association between AWP and CF. Among 
patients with CF, greater AWP occurs in those who are homozygous for the 
DeltaF508 mutation.
