PURPOSE: There is no effective therapy for patients with advanced medullary 
thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Vandetanib, a once-daily oral inhibitor of RET kinase, 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor 
receptor signaling, has previously shown antitumor activity in a phase II study 
of patients with advanced hereditary MTC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced MTC were randomly assigned in a 2:1 
ratio to receive vandetanib 300 mg/d or placebo. On objective disease 
progression, patients could elect to receive open-label vandetanib. The primary 
end point was progression-free survival (PFS), determined by independent central 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) assessments.
RESULTS: Between December 2006 and November 2007, 331 patients (mean age, 52 
years; 90% sporadic; 95% metastatic) were randomly assigned to receive 
vandetanib (231) or placebo (100). At data cutoff (July 2009; median follow-up, 
24 months), 37% of patients had progressed and 15% had died. The study met its 
primary objective of PFS prolongation with vandetanib versus placebo (hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.69; P < .001). Statistically significant 
advantages for vandetanib were also seen for objective response rate (P < .001), 
disease control rate (P = .001), and biochemical response (P < .001). Overall 
survival data were immature at data cutoff (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.65). A 
final survival analysis will take place when 50% of the patients have died. 
Common adverse events (any grade) occurred more frequently with vandetanib 
compared with placebo, including diarrhea (56% v 26%), rash (45% v 11%), nausea 
(33% v 16%), hypertension (32% v 5%), and headache (26% v 9%).
CONCLUSION: Vandetanib demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a phase III trial of 
patients with advanced MTC (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00410761).
