Multiomics technologies improve the biological understanding of health status in 
people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (PWH). Still, a systematic and 
in-depth characterization of metabolic risk profile during successful long-term 
treatment is lacking. Here, we used multi-omics (plasma lipidomic, metabolomic, 
and fecal 16 S microbiome) data-driven stratification and characterization to 
identify the metabolic at-risk profile within PWH. Through network analysis and 
similarity network fusion (SNF), we identified three groups of PWH (SNF-1-3): 
healthy (HC)-like (SNF-1), mild at-risk (SNF-3), and severe at-risk (SNF-2). The 
PWH in the SNF-2 (45%) had a severe at-risk metabolic profile with increased 
visceral adipose tissue, BMI, higher incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), and 
increased di- and triglycerides despite having higher CD4+ T-cell counts than 
the other two clusters. However, the HC-like and the severe at-risk group had a 
similar metabolic profile differing from HIV-negative controls (HNC), with 
dysregulation of amino acid metabolism. At the microbiome profile, the HC-like 
group had a lower α-diversity, a lower proportion of men having sex with men 
(MSM) and was enriched in Bacteroides. In contrast, in at-risk groups, there was 
an increase in Prevotella, with a high proportion of MSM, which could 
potentially lead to higher systemic inflammation and increased cardiometabolic 
risk profile. The multi-omics integrative analysis also revealed a complex 
microbial interplay of the microbiome-associated metabolites in PWH. Those 
severely at-risk clusters may benefit from personalized medicine and lifestyle 
intervention to improve their dysregulated metabolic traits, aiming to achieve 
healthier aging.
