OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of BRCA2 gene mutations among familial 
and/or early-onset breast cancer patients in eastern Shandong of China.
METHODS: Fifty-two familial and/or early-onset breast cancer patients from 
unrelated family were analyzed. Genomic DNA was collected from the peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells, the coding sequences and exon-intron boundaries of 
BRCA2 gene were screened using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography 
(DHPLC), and the abnormal fragments were confirmed with direct DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Three mutations (5.8%) in BRCA2 gene were identified. They were 2001del 
TTAT, 4099C to T and 5873C to A. To our knowledge, all of them were firstly 
found in Chinese population. Furthermore, all the three mutations (12%) were 
identified in familial breast cancer patients, and none was in the early-onset 
patients.
CONCLUSION: BRCA2 may play an important role in the familial breast cancer in 
eastern Shandong Chinese population, but not in the early-onset breast cancer. 
It is necessary to give genetic test to familial breast cancer patients in this 
population.
