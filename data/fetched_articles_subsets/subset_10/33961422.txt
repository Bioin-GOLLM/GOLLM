The relevance of MRI as a diagnostic methodology has been expanding 
significantly with the development of molecular imaging. Partially, the credit 
for this advancement is due to the increasing potential and performance of 
targeted MRI contrast agents, which are able to specifically bind distinct 
receptors or biomarkers. Consequently, these allow for the identification of 
tissues undergoing a disease, resulting in the over- or underexpression of the 
particular molecular targets. Here we report a multimeric molecular probe, which 
combines the established targeting properties of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide 
sequence toward the integrins with three calcium-responsive, Gd-based 
paramagnetic moieties. The bifunctional probe showed excellent 1H MRI contrast 
enhancement upon Ca2+ coordination and demonstrated a longer retention time in 
the tissue due to the presence of the RGD moiety. The obtained results testify 
to the potential of combining bioresponsive contrast agents with targeting 
vectors to develop novel functional molecular imaging methods.
