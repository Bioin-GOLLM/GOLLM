With the rapid growth of synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA)-based therapeutics and 
vaccines, the development of analytical tools for characterization of long, 
complex RNAs has become essential. Tandem liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) permits direct assessment of the mRNA primary sequence 
and modifications thereof without conversion to cDNA or amplification. It relies 
upon digestion of mRNA with site-specific endoribonucleases to generate pools of 
short oligonucleotides that are then amenable to MS-based sequence analysis. 
Here, we showed that the uridine-specific human endoribonuclease hRNase 4 
improves mRNA sequence coverage, in comparison with the benchmark enzyme RNase 
T1, by producing a larger population of uniquely mappable cleavage products. We 
deployed hRNase 4 to characterize mRNAs fully substituted with 
1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ) or 5-methoxyuridine (mo5U), as well as mRNAs 
selectively depleted of uridine-two key strategies to reduce synthetic mRNA 
immunogenicity. Lastly, we demonstrated that hRNase 4 enables direct assessment 
of the 5' cap incorporation into in vitro transcribed mRNA. Collectively, this 
study highlights the power of hRNase 4 to interrogate mRNA sequence, identity, 
and modifications by LC-MS/MS.
