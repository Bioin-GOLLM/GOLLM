Bispecific antibodies, while showing great therapeutic potential, pose 
formidable challenges with respect to their assembly, stability, immunogenicity, 
and pharmacodynamics. Here we describe a novel class of bispecific antibodies 
with native human immunoglobulin format. The design exploits differences in the 
affinities of the immunoglobulin isotypes for Protein A, allowing efficient 
large-scale purification. Using this format, we generated a bispecific antibody, 
REGN1979, targeting the B cell marker, CD20, and the CD3 component of the T cell 
receptor, which triggers redirected killing of B cells. In mice, this antibody 
prevented growth of B cell tumors and also caused regression of large 
established tumors. In cynomolgus monkeys, low doses of REGN1979 caused 
prolonged depletion of B cells in peripheral blood with a serum half-life of 
approximately 14 days. Further, the antibody induced a deeper depletion of B 
cells in lymphoid organs than rituximab. This format has broad applicability for 
development of clinical bispecific antibodies.
