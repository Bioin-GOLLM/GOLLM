Accumulated hard tissue debris (AHTD) is an inevitable by-product during 
endodontic treatment and is difficult to remove completely using traditional 
syringe and needle irrigation (SNI). Adjunctive irrigation is proposed to assist 
the clean-up of AHTD. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate 
the AHTD removal efficacy of different root canal irrigation devices using 
micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT). A literature search was carried out within 
the main scientific databases until 20 June 2022. All results were screened with 
detailed eligibility criteria. Eleven studies were included for analysis. SNI, 
passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), negative pressure systems, sonically 
activated irrigation (SAI), mechanical-activated system and laser-activated 
irrigation (LAI) were assessed. PUI is superior to SNI for debris removal and 
LAI has better AHTD removal performance than PUI. The negative pressure system 
and mechanical-activated system were proved to be less effective. Registration: 
PROSPERO (CRD42021273892).
