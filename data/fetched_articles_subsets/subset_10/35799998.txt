INTRODUCTION: An imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and 
the defence mechanisms underlying the activity of antioxidant enzymes has been 
demonstrated as the leading pathology in diabetes mellitus (DM)-related 
microvascular complications.
PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the association between polymorphisms in 
antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes: catalase (CAT); manganese superoxide 
dismutase (Mn-SOD); glutathione S transferase M1 (GSTM1); and GSTT1 glutathione 
S transferase T1 (GSTT1), and the risk of type II diabetic nephropathy (DN) in 
the Saudi population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study involved 64 type II DM patients with 
nephropathy and 64 type II diabetes patients without nephropathy from the King 
Abdulaziz University (KAU) Hospital. They underwent real-time PCR genotyping for 
the Mn-SOD and CAT genes. Multiplex PCR was used to detect GSTM1- and GSTT1-null 
polymorphisms.
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was observed between the case 
and control groups with regard to polymorphisms in the CAT gene (P = 0.037), but 
not for polymorphisms in the Mn-SOD (P = 0.64) gene. In addition, a 
statistically significant association was observed between null polymorphisms of 
the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes and DN in the case and control groups (P = 0.046 and P 
= 0.035, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the genetic ability to combat oxidative 
stress may play a major role in DN pathogenesis in Saudi type II DM patients. 
These polymorphisms in antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes could be used as 
independent genetic markers for the construction of risk prediction models for 
kidney-related complications in type II DM patients.
