RNA polymerase (Pol) III has a noncanonical role of viral DNA sensing in the 
innate immune system. This polymerase transcribes viral genomes to produce RNAs 
that lead to induction of type I interferons (IFNs). However, the genetic and 
functional links of Pol III to innate immunity in humans remain largely unknown. 
Here, we describe a rare homozygous mutation (D40H) in the POLR3E gene, coding 
for a protein subunit of Pol III, in a child with recurrent and systemic viral 
infections and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Fibroblasts derived from the 
patient exhibit impaired induction of type I IFN and increased susceptibility to 
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Cultured cell lines infected with HCMV 
show induction of POLR3E expression. However, induction is not restricted to DNA 
virus, as sindbis virus, an RNA virus, enhances the expression of this protein. 
Likewise, foreign nonviral DNA elevates the steady-state level of POLR3E and 
elicits promoter-dependent and -independent transcription by Pol III. 
Remarkably, the molecular mechanism underlying the D40H mutation of POLR3E 
involves the assembly of defective initiation complexes of Pol III. Our study 
links mutated POLR3E and Pol III to an innate immune deficiency state in humans.
