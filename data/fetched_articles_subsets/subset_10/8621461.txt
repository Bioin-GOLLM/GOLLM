The full-length cDNA of (S)-hydroxynitrile lyase (Hnl) from leaves of Hevea 
brasiliensis (tropical rubber tree) was cloned by an immunoscreening and 
sequenced. Hnl from H. brasiliensis is involved in the biodegradation of 
cyanogenic glycosides and also catalyzes the stereospecific synthesis of 
aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic cyanohydrins, which are important as 
precursors for pharmaceutical compounds. The open reading frame identified in a 
1. 1-kilobase cDNA fragment codes for a protein of 257 amino acids with a 
predicted molecular mass of 29.2 kDa. The derived protein sequence is closely 
related to the (S)-hydroxynitrile lyase from Manihot esculenta (Cassava) and 
also shows significant homology to two proteins of Oryza sativa with as yet 
unknown enzymatic function. The H. brasiliensis protein was expressed in 
Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and isolated in an active form 
from the respective soluble fractions. Replacement of cysteine 81 by serine 
drastically reduced activity of the heterologous enzyme, suggesting a role for 
this amino acid residue in the catalytic action of Hnl.
