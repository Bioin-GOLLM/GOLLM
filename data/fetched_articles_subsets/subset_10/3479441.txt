A Japanese family with atypical type I familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) 
in Iiyama, Japan was studied. Most of the family members have dysfunctions in 
the central nervous system, in addition to typical symptoms of type I FAP. The 
transthyretin (TTR, also called prealbumin) gene of the atypical FAP(FAP-IY) was 
analyzed with recombinant DNA techniques and a RIA method. FAP-IY was found to 
have the mutation responsible for the methionine-for-valine substitution at 
position 30 of TTR, as in the case of typical type I FAP. However, analysis of 
DNA polymorphisms in the TTR locus showed that FAP-IY has a genetic background 
differing from that of the typical type I FAP. These observations lead to the 
consideration that a genetic factor(s) involved in the dysfunction of the 
central nervous system may locate in a chromosome region in close proximity to 
the TTR gene.
