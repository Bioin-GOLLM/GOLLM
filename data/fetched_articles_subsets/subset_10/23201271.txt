Little is known about molecular recognition of acetylated N termini, despite 
prevalence of this modification among eukaryotic cytosolic proteins. We report 
that the family of human DCN-like (DCNL) co-E3s, which promote ligation of the 
ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to cullin targets, recognizes acetylated N termini 
of the E2 enzymes UBC12 and UBE2F. Systematic biochemical and biophysical 
analyses reveal 40- and 10-fold variations in affinities among different 
DCNL-cullin and DCNL-E2 complexes, contributing to varying efficiencies of 
different NEDD8 ligation cascades. Structures of DCNL2 and DCNL3 complexes with 
N-terminally acetylated peptides from UBC12 and UBE2F illuminate a common 
mechanism by which DCNL proteins recognize N-terminally acetylated E2s and how 
selectivity for interactions dependent on N-acetyl-methionine are established 
through side chains recognizing distal residues. Distinct preferences of UBC12 
and UBE2F peptides for inhibiting different DCNLs, including the oncogenic DCNL1 
protein, suggest it may be possible to develop small molecules blocking specific 
N-acetyl-methionine-dependent protein interactions.
