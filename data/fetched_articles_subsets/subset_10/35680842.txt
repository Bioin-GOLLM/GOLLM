FOXM1 is a potent oncogenic transcription factor essential for cancer 
initiation, progression, and drug resistance. FOXM1 regulatory network is a 
major predictor of adverse outcomes in various human cancers. Inhibition of 
FOXM1 transcription factor function is a potential strategy in cancer treatment. 
In this study, we performed structure-based in silico screening to discover 
small molecules targeting the FOXM1 DNA-binding domain (DBD). Compound XST-20 
was identified to effectively suppress FOXM1 transcriptional activities and 
inhibit ovarian cancer cell proliferation. XST-20 directly interacts with the 
FOXM1 DNA-binding domain determined by SPR assay. Furthermore, XST-20 was found 
to significantly reduce the colony-forming efficiency and induce cell cycle 
arrest and apoptosis. Our study provides a lead compound of FOXM1 inhibitor 
which may serve as a potential targeted therapy agent for ovarian cancer.
