Complement overactivation mediates microglial synapse elimination in 
neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD), but how complement activity is regulated in the brain remains 
largely unknown. We identified that the secreted neuronal pentraxin Nptx2 binds 
complement C1q and thereby regulates its activity in the brain. Nptx2-deficient 
mice show increased complement activity, C1q-dependent microglial synapse 
engulfment, and loss of excitatory synapses. In a neuroinflammation culture 
model and in aged TauP301S mice, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated neuronal 
overexpression of Nptx2 was sufficient to restrain complement activity and 
ameliorate microglia-mediated synapse loss. Analysis of human cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) samples from a genetic FTD cohort revealed reduced concentrations of 
Nptx2 and Nptx2-C1q protein complexes in symptomatic patients, which correlated 
with elevated C1q and activated C3. Together, these results show that Nptx2 
regulates complement activity and microglial synapse elimination in the brain 
and that diminished Nptx2 concentrations might exacerbate complement-mediated 
neurodegeneration in patients with FTD.
