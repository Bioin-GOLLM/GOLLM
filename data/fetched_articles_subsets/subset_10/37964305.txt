OBJECTIVES: A SNV is a single nucleotide change that can occur at any point in 
the genome. SNVs are the most common genetic variants that occur in the human 
genome, and a number of SNVs have been found to be associated with human traits 
and disease. Researchers genotype SNVs using TaqMan technology, DNA microarray, 
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and automated sequencing, which are expensive and 
time-consuming. The OPRM1 gene rs1799971 (A118G) has been identified for its 
association with Opioid use disorder (OUD). The present study focused on 
developing a single step identification test using Tetra-Primer Amplification 
Refractory Mutation System-PCR (T-ARMS-PCR) to detect the presence of SNV OPRM1 
rs1799971 (A118G). This study was performed to optimize the protocol for the 
designed four primers and validate it using a total of 52 buccal samples from 
volunteers who are currently under rehabilitation for the drug abuse disorder.
RESULTS: Utilizing 52 DNA samples, a novel T-ARMS-PCR assay was successfully 
developed, tested, and validated. The products of the T-ARMS PCR for rs1799971 
contained 395 bp as the control band, 186 bp as G allele (variant) and 257 bp as 
A allele (wild type), which were observed in the gel image. The genotype 
frequencies for the OPRM1 gene rs1799971 (A118G) were 44% (22/52) of homozygous 
variant type (GG), 28.9% (15/52) of homozygous wild type (AA) and 28.9% (15/22) 
of heterozygous (AG). The G allele frequency was 56.7% and A allele frequency 
was 43.3%.
