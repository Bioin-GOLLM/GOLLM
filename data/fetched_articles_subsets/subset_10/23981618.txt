BACKGROUND: The congenital Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a hereditary cardiac 
channelopathy that is characterized by a prolonged QT interval, syncope, 
ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. The chromosome 7-linked type 2 
congenital LQTS (LQT2) is caused by gene mutations in the human 
ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG).
METHODS: A Chinese family diagnosed with LQTS were screened for KCNQ1, HERG and 
SCN5A, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct sequencing, and clong 
sequencing. We also investigated the mRNA expression of the HERG gene.
RESULTS: We identified a novel I414fs + 98X mutation in the HERG gene. The 
deletion mutation of 14-bp in the first transmembrane segment (S1) introduced 
premature termination codons (PTCs) at the end of exon 6. This mutation would 
result in a serious phenotype if the truncated proteins co-assembled with normal 
subunit to form the defective channels. But only the proband was symptomatic.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the mRNA level of the HERG gene was significantly 
lower in I414fs + 98X carriers than in noncarriers. We found a novel I414fs + 
98X mutation. The mRNA level supports that NMD mechanism might regulate the 
novel mutation.
