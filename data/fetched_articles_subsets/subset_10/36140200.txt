Extensive progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of cancer growth 
and proliferation has led to the remarkable development of drugs that target 
cancer-driving molecules. Most target molecules are proteins such as kinases and 
kinase-associated receptors, which have enzymatic activities needed for the 
signaling cascades of cells. The small molecule inhibitors for these target 
molecules greatly improved therapeutic efficacy and lowered the systemic 
toxicity in cancer therapies. However, long-term and high-dosage treatment of 
small inhibitors for cancer has produced other obstacles, such as resistance to 
inhibitors. Among recent approaches to overcoming drug resistance to cancers, 
targeted protein degradation (TPD) such as proteolysis-targeting chimera 
(PROTAC) technology adopts a distinct mechanism of action by which a target 
protein is destroyed through the cellular proteolytic system, such as the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system or autophagy. Here, we review the currently 
developed PROTACs as the representative TPD molecules for cancer therapy and the 
N-degrons of the N-degron pathways as the potential TPD ligands.
