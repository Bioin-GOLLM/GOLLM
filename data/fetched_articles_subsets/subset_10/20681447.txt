BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent studies indicated that Non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) patients with mutant K-RAS failed to benefit from adjuvant 
chemotherapy, and the cancer did not respond to epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). These findings indicated that K-RAS 
gene status can be a biomarker to predict the sensitivity of EGFR TKIs. The aim 
of this study is to analyze K-RAS gene mutations with NSCLC patients in Cancer 
Center of Sun Yet-sen University.
METHODS: 52 fresh frozen tumor tissues were collected and K-RAS genes were 
amplified by PCR. Then PCR amplification fragments were sequenced and analyzed.
RESULTS: Somatic mutations in the codon 12 of K-RAS gene in tumors were 
identified from 2 of 52 (3.8%) patients. There were no relationships among K-RAS 
gene mutations and gender, pathology, smoking, differentiation and stage.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of K-RAS gene mutations with NSCLC in our center is 
very low and is similar to that in Asia patients, and is lower than that in 
Caucasian population.

背景与目的: 最近研究显示存在K-RAS基因突变的非小细胞肺癌患者难以从辅助化疗中获益，并且对表皮生长因子受体（epidermal growth factor 
receptor, EGFR）酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（tyrosine kinase Inhibitors, 
TKIs）耐药。这些发现提示K-RAS基因突变情况可作为EGFR 
TKIs疗效的预测指标。本研究中分析了中山大学肿瘤防治中心非小细胞肺癌患者肺癌组织中K-RAS基因突变情况。
方法: 收集52例非小细胞肺癌患者的新鲜组织标本，采用PCR技术扩增K-RAS基因，然后进行DNA测序并进行相应分析。
结果: 在52例患者中，2例患者肿瘤组织中的K-RAS基因的12号密码子存在突变（2/52, 
3.8%）。统计学分析未发现K-RAS基因突变与性别、病理类型、吸烟情况以及肿瘤分化程度和分期间存在相互关系。
结论: 非小细胞肺癌患者K-RAS基因突变率较低，与亚裔患者相近，而低于白种人患者。
