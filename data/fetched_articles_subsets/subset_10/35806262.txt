Methuosis is a type of programmed cell death in which the cytoplasm is occupied 
by fluid-filled vacuoles that originate from macropinosomes (cytoplasmic 
vacuolation). A few molecules have been reported to behave as methuosis inducers 
in cancer cell lines. Jaspine B (JB) is a natural anhydrous sphingolipid (SL) 
derivative reported to induce cytoplasmic vacuolation and cytotoxicity in 
several cancer cell lines. Here, we have investigated the mechanism and 
signalling pathways involved in the cytotoxicity induced by the natural 
sphingolipid Jaspine B (JB) in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, which harbor the 
G12S K-Ras mutant. The effect of JB on inducing cytoplasmic vacuolation and 
modifying cell viability was determined in A549 cells, as well as in mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) lacking either the autophagy-related gene ATG5 or 
BAX/BAK genes. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry after annexin 
V/propidium iodide staining, in the presence and absence of z-VAD. Autophagy was 
monitored by LC3-II/GFP-LC3-II analysis, and autophagic flux experiments using 
protease inhibitors. Phase contrast, confocal, and transmission electron 
microscopy were used to monitor cytoplasmic vacuolation and the uptake of 
Lucifer yellow to assess macropinocyosis. We present evidence that cytoplasmic 
vacuolation and methuosis are involved in Jaspine B cytotoxicity over A549 cells 
and that activation of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) could be involved 
in Jaspine-B-induced vacuolation, independently of the phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase/protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 
(PI3K/Akt/mTORC1) axis.
