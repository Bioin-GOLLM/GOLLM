BACKGROUND: In the mammalian zygote, epigenetic reprogramming is a tightly 
controlled process of coordinated alterations of histone and DNA modifications. 
The parental genomes of the zygote show distinct patterns of histone H3 variants 
and distinct patterns of DNA and histone modifications. The molecular mechanisms 
linking histone variant-specific modifications and DNA methylation reprogramming 
during the first cell cycle remain to be clarified.
RESULTS: Here, we show that the degree and distribution of H3K9me2 and of DNA 
modifications (5mC/5hmC) are influenced by the phosphorylation status of H3S10 
and H3T11. The overexpression of the mutated histone variants H3.1 and 3.2 at 
either serine 10 or threonine 11 causes a decrease in H3K9me2 and 5mC and a 
concomitant increase in 5hmC in the maternal genome. Bisulphite sequencing 
results indicate an increase in hemimethylated CpG positions following H3.1T10A 
overexpression suggesting an impact of H3S10 and H3T11 phosphorylation on DNA 
methylation maintenance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a crosstalk between the cell-cycle-dependent 
control of S10 and T11 phosphorylation of histone variants H3.1 and H3.2 and the 
maintenance of the heterochromatic mark H3K9me2. This histone H3 
"phospho-methylation switch" also influences the oxidative control of DNA 
methylation in the mouse zygote.
