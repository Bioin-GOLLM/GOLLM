Axonal degeneration is an early and prominent feature of many neurological 
disorders. SARM1 is the central executioner of the axonal degeneration pathway 
that culminates in depletion of axonal NAD+, yet the identity of the underlying 
NAD+-depleting enzyme(s) is unknown. Here, in a series of experiments using 
purified proteins from mammalian cells, bacteria, and a cell-free protein 
translation system, we show that the SARM1-TIR domain itself has intrinsic 
NADase activity-cleaving NAD+ into ADP-ribose (ADPR), cyclic ADPR, and 
nicotinamide, with nicotinamide serving as a feedback inhibitor of the enzyme. 
Using traumatic and vincristine-induced injury models in neurons, we demonstrate 
that the NADase activity of full-length SARM1 is required in axons to promote 
axonal NAD+ depletion and axonal degeneration after injury. Hence, the SARM1 
enzyme represents a novel therapeutic target for axonopathies. Moreover, the 
widely utilized TIR domain is a protein motif that can possess enzymatic 
activity.
