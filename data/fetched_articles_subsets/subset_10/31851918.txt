While comorbid pain in depression (CP) occurs at a high rate worldwide, the 
neural connections underlying the core symptoms of CP have yet to be elucidated. 
Here, we define a pathway whereby GABAergic neurons from the central nucleus of 
the amygdala (GABACeA) project to glutamatergic neurons in the parafascicular 
nucleus (GluPF). These GluPF neurons relay directly to neurons in the second 
somatosensory cortex (S2), a well-known area involved in pain signal processing. 
Enhanced inhibition of the GABACeA→GluPF→S2 pathway is found in mice exhibiting 
CP symptoms. Reversing this pathway using chemogenetic or optogenetic approaches 
alleviates CP symptoms. Together, the current study demonstrates the putative 
importance of the GABACeA→GluPF→S2 pathway in controlling at least some aspects 
of CP.
