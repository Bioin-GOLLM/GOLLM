RATIONALE: Uncommon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are 
increasingly being identified in non-small cell lung cancer. Insertion and 
deletion mutations have been detected in exons 18, 19, and 20, but not in exon 
21. In patients with uncommon mutations, the second-generation EGFR tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor afatinib has shown good efficacy, whereas that of dacomitinib, 
another second-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, remains unknown. Here, 
we reported a patient with a novel EGFR21 exon insertion-deletion (indel) 
mutation and demonstrated the efficacy of dacomitinib.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old nonsmoking Chinese male was admitted to the 
hospital with lung cancer after a chest computed tomography for coughing and 
sputum. The patient's condition progressed after multiple treatments including 
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.
DIAGNOSIS: The patient had clinical manifestations of cough and sputum and was 
pathologically confirmed to have T2bN1M0 (stage IIB) lung adenocarcinoma 
according to the seventh edition of tumor-node-metastasis staging. The patient 
underwent a second operation after detection of recurrence, and postoperative 
pathology confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lung. The patient progressed again 
after surgery, and the tumor-node-metastasis stage was changed to T4N0M1a (stage 
IVA) before treatment with dacomitinib.
INTERVENTIONS: After detection of the EGFR exon 21 indel mutation, the patient 
began treatment with dacomitinib (45 mg once a day) on March 12, 2021.
OUTCOMES: After 1 month of targeted therapy, the patient showed a partial 
response to dacomitinib. As of March 19, 2022, his condition remained stable and 
he continued to receive dacomitinib. Progression-free survival reached 12.4 
months. The patient experienced mild adverse reactions of pruritus during the 
use of dacomitinib, but recovered after drug treatment.
LESSON: We reported a novel EGFR exon 21 indel mutation in a lung adenocarcinoma 
patient. Dacomitinib showed efficacy in the treatment of a patient with this 
mutation, suggesting that its efficacy in patients with uncommon mutations 
should be explored further. The next-generation sequencing is recommended as a 
guiding tool for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
