Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibitors have been reported as 
treatment options for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in preclinical models and are 
currently being evaluated in clinical trials. This work presents a novel potent 
and selective BET inhibitor (BI 894999), which has recently entered clinical 
trials (NCT02516553). In preclinical studies, this compound is highly active in 
AML cell lines, primary patient samples, and xenografts. HEXIM1 is described as 
an excellent pharmacodynamic biomarker for target engagement in tumors as well 
as in blood. Mechanistic studies show that BI 894999 targets 
super-enhancer-regulated oncogenes and other lineage-specific factors, which are 
involved in the maintenance of the disease state. BI 894999 is active as 
monotherapy in AML xenografts, and in addition leads to strongly enhanced 
antitumor effects in combination with CDK9 inhibitors. This treatment 
combination results in a marked decrease of global p-Ser2 RNA polymerase II 
levels and leads to rapid induction of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Together, 
these data provide a strong rationale for the clinical evaluation of BI 894999 
in AML.
