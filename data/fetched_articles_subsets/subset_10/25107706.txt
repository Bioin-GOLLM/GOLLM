Small molecule kinase inhibitors have proven enormously successful at delivering 
impressive responses in patients with cancers as diverse as chronic 
myeloid-leukemia, melanoma, breast cancer and small cell lung cancer. Despite 
this, resistance is commonplace and most patients ultimately fail therapy. One 
emerging observation is the rapid rewiring of signaling that occurs across 
multiple cancer types when driver oncogene function is inhibited. These adaptive 
signaling changes seem critical in delivering some of the earliest survival 
signals that allow small numbers of cells to evade therapy. In this commentary 
we review the mechanisms that contribute to the robustness of signaling networks 
within cancer cells and suggest new therapeutic strategies to limit treatment 
failure.
