BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 
1b infection have nonresponse to the most current treatment, pegylated 
interferon with ribavirin. Mutations in the HCV core region were recently 
proposed to be associated with nonresponse. Our aim was to evaluate the viral 
factors associated with treatment failure.
METHODS: HCV variants were determined directly and after cloning in 66 
HCV-1b-infected Japanese patients and in 5 urokinase-type plasminogen activator 
transgenic severe combined immunodeficiency mice with human hepatocytes 
(chimeric mice), at baseline, during treatment, and after treatment.
RESULTS: At baseline, glutamine at position 70 of the HCV core protein (70Q) was 
detected by direct sequencing in 20% of patients with virologic response and in 
43.8% of patients with nonresponse. Among patients with nonresponse, who were 
examined during and after treatment, the prevalence of the 70Q substitution 
increased to 56.3%, which indicates that treatment-induced selection occurred in 
all patients with nonresponse who had 70Q quasispecies detectable by cloning. 
This observation was reinforced by the results from experimentally infected 
chimeric mice. Logistic regression analysis indicated that detection of 70Q 
quasispecies was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of 
nonresponse (odds ratio, 15.1; P = .004) in the studied cohort.
CONCLUSION: Presence of the 70Q quasispecies at baseline was associated with an 
increased risk of treatment failure, as indicated by the positive selection of 
the 70Q clones induced by treatment with pegylated interferon with ribavirin. 
These results urge further investigation of the mechanisms of this association.
