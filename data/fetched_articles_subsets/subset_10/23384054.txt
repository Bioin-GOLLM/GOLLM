Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, (NAIT) is caused by maternal antibodies 
raised against alloantigens carried on fetal platelets. Although many cases are 
mild, NAIT is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns and is 
the most common cause of intracranial haemorrhage in full-term infants. In this 
report, we review the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory diagnosis 
and prenatal and post-natal management of NAIT and highlight areas of 
controversy that deserve the attention of clinical and laboratory investigators.
