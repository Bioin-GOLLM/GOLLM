The solute carrier, human organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2, 
OATP-A, OATP1 and OATP) is highly expressed in the intestine, kidney, 
cholangiocytes and the blood-brain barrier. This localization suggests that 
OATP1A2 may be vitally important in the absorption, distribution and excretion 
of a broad array of clinically important drugs. Several nonsynonymous 
polymorphisms have been identified in the gene encoding OATP1A2, SLCO1A2 
(SLC21A3), with some of these variants demonstrating functional changes in the 
transport of OATP1A2 substrates.
