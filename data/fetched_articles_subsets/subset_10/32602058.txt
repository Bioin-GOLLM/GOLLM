PURPOSE: The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) provided millions of people with 
health insurance coverage and facilitated routine cancer screening by requiring 
insurers to cover preventive services without cost-sharing. Despite greater 
access to affordable cancer screening, Pap testing has declined over time. The 
aim of this study is to assess participation in Pap test and HPV vaccination, 
and adherence to guidelines as outlined by the American Cancer Society (ACS) 
from the 2010 ACA provision eliminating cost-sharing for preventive services.
METHODS: Using multi-year responses from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System, we examined the association between the ACA and participation in and 
adherence to Pap testing and HPV vaccination behaviors as set by the ACS. The 
sample included women aged 21-29 who completed the survey between 2008 and 2018 
(every other year) and who live in 24 US States (N = 37,893).
RESULTS: Results showed significant decreases in Pap testing rates but increases 
in the uptake of the HPV vaccine series for all age groups and across all 
demographics. Post-ACA year significantly predicted increases in HPV + Pap 
co-testing participation and adherence. Women with health insurance coverage 
were more likely to engage in both behaviors.
CONCLUSION: Findings raise concerns around declines in the proportion of women 
receiving and adhering to Pap testing guidelines. A need exists for research to 
examine the role of increases in HPV vaccination uptake on decreases in Pap 
testing. Moreover, effective strategies should target increases in cervical 
cancer screening uptake among women vaccinated against HPV.
