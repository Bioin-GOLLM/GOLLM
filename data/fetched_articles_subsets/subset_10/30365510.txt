Mutations in interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) genes are one cause of very 
early-onset inflammatory bowel disease with perianal lesions, which can be cured 
by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Using a functional test, which 
assesses responsiveness of peripheral monocytes to IL-10, we identified three 
unrelated Portuguese patients carrying two novel IL-10RB mutations. In the three 
patients, sequencing of genomic DNA identified the same large deletion of exon 3 
which precluded protein expression. This mutation was homozygous in two patients 
born from consanguineous families and heterozygous in the third patient born 
from unrelated parents. Microsatellite analysis of the IL10RB genomic region 
revealed a common haplotype in the three Portuguese families pointing to a 
founder deletion inherited from a common ancestor 400 years ago. In the third 
patient, surface expression of IL-10R was normal but signaling in response to 
IL-10 was impaired. Complementary DNA sequencing and next-generation sequencing 
of IL10RB locus with custom-made probes revealed a ≈ 6 Kb duplication 
encompassing the exon 6 which leads to a frameshift mutation and a loss of the 
TYK2-interacting Box 2 motif. Altogether, we describe two novel copy number 
variations in IL10RB, one with founder effect and one preserving cell surface 
expression but abolishing signaling.
