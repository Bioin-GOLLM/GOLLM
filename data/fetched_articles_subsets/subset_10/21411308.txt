Protein engineering of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) has been very 
successful in generating valuable non-natural activities and properties, 
allowing these powerful catalysts to be used for the synthesis of drug 
metabolites and in biosynthetic pathways for the production of precursors of 
artemisinin and paclitaxel. Collected experience indicates that the P450s are 
highly 'evolvable' - they are particularly robust to mutation in their active 
sites and readily accept new substrates and exhibit new selectivities. Their 
ability to adapt to new challenges upon mutation may reflect the nonpolar nature 
of their active sites as well as their high degree of conformational 
variability.
