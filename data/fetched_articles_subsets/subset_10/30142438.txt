The CACNA1A gene encodes a calcium-dependent voltage channel, localized in 
neuronal cells. Pathogenic variants in this gene are known to lead to a broad 
clinical spectrum including episodic ataxia type 2, spinocerebellar ataxia type 
6, familial hemiplegic migraine, and more recently epileptic encephalopathy. We 
report a large family revealing a wide variability of neurological 
manifestations associated with a CACNA1A missense pathogenic variant. The index 
case had early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with progressive cerebellar 
atrophy, although his mother and his great-grandmother suffered from paroxystic 
episodic ataxia. His grandfather and great grand-aunt reported no symptoms, but 
two of her sons displayed early-onset ataxia with intellectual disability. Two 
of her little daughters suffered from gait disorders, and also from epilepsy for 
one of them. All these relatives were carriers of the previously described 
heterozygous variant in CACNA1A gene. We report here the first family leading to 
major clinical variability and incomplete penetrance. Our family highlights the 
difficulties to provide accurate genetic counselling concerning prenatal 
diagnosis regarding highly variable severity of the clinical presentation.
