The discovery of activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations 
spurred the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib, as 
the first-line treatment of lung cancers. We previously reported that 
differential degradation of TKI-sensitive (e.g. L858R) and resistant (T790M) 
EGFR mutants upon erlotinib treatment correlates with drug sensitivity. We also 
reported that SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2) ligase activity 
is important in stabilizing EGFR. However, the molecular mechanisms involved 
remain unclear. Here, using in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays, MS, and 
superresolution microscopy, we show SMURF2-EGFR functional interaction is 
important for EGFR stability and response to TKI. We demonstrate that 
L858R/T790M EGFR is preferentially stabilized by SMURF2-UBCH5 (an 
E3-E2)-mediated polyubiquitination. We identified four lysine residues as the 
sites of ubiquitination and showed that replacement of one of them with 
acetylation-mimicking glutamine increases the sensitivity of mutant EGFR to 
erlotinib-induced degradation. We show that SMURF2 extends membrane retention of 
EGF-bound EGFR, whereas SMURF2 knockdown increases receptor sorting to 
lysosomes. In lung cancer cell lines, SMURF2 overexpression increased EGFR 
levels, improving TKI tolerance, whereas SMURF2 knockdown decreased EGFR 
steady-state levels and sensitized lung cancer cells. Overall, we propose that 
SMURF2-mediated polyubiquitination of L858R/T790M EGFR competes with 
acetylation-mediated receptor internalization that correlates with enhanced 
receptor stability; therefore, disruption of the E3-E2 complex may be an 
attractive target to overcome TKI resistance.
