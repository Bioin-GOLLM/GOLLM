WDR62 mutations that result in protein loss, truncation or single amino-acid 
substitutions are causative for human microcephaly, indicating critical roles in 
cell expansion required for brain development. WDR62 missense mutations that 
retain protein expression represent partial loss-of-function mutants that may 
therefore provide specific insights into radial glial cell processes critical 
for brain growth. Here we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to generate three 
strains of WDR62 mutant mice; WDR62 V66M/V66M and WDR62R439H/R439H mice 
recapitulate conserved missense mutations found in humans with microcephaly, 
with the third strain being a null allele (WDR62stop/stop). Each of these 
mutations resulted in embryonic lethality to varying degrees and gross 
morphological defects consistent with ciliopathies (dwarfism, anophthalmia and 
microcephaly). We find that WDR62 mutant proteins (V66M and R439H) localize to 
the basal body but fail to recruit CPAP. As a consequence, we observe deficient 
recruitment of IFT88, a protein that is required for cilia formation. This 
underpins the maintenance of radial glia as WDR62 mutations caused premature 
differentiation of radial glia resulting in reduced generation of neurons and 
cortical thinning. These findings highlight the important role of the primary 
cilium in neocortical expansion and implicate ciliary dysfunction as underlying 
the pathology of MCPH2 patients.
