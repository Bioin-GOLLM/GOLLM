INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer (BC) is the first leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality in females worldwide. We have investigated the 
correlation between circ-ITCH gene polymorphisms, circ-ITCH expression, and 
their effect on β-catenin levels and BC development.
METHODS: Participants included 62 BC and 62 controls matched in terms of age. 
The circ-ITCH polymorphisms rs10485505 and rs4911154 were genotyped using whole 
blood samples. In addition, mRNA expression analysis of circ-ITCH was performed 
on BC tissues. The β-catenin levels in serum samples were measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: The qRT-PCR results demonstrated that circ-ITCH was significantly 
downregulated in BC compared to normal healthy tissues. The genotype 
distribution of rs10485505 and rs4911154 were significantly associated with BC 
risk. For rs10485505, genotype CT and TT were significantly associated with an 
increased BC risk. In contrast, there was a significant association between 
rs4911154, genotypes GA and AA, and an increased BC risk. Regarding the 
rs10485505 genotype, carriers of the T allele frequently have a poor prognosis 
compared to carriers of the CC genotype. Serum β-catenin in the BC patients' 
group was significantly higher than in the control group. The relative 
expression levels of circ-ITCH were remarkably decreased in the BC samples of 
patients carrying the A allele at rs4911154 compared to patients with a GG 
genotype. Conversely, β-catenin protein levels were increased in patients 
carrying the A allele, while rs10485505 genotype carriers of the CT and TT 
genotypes showed downregulation of circ-ITCH expression fold compared to the CC 
genotype. Contrarily, β-catenin levels markedly increased in TT and CT genotypes 
compared with the CC genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research showed that the rs10485505 polymorphism (T allele) and 
the rs4911154 polymorphism (A allele) are associated with the risk and prognosis 
of BC. This finding may be due to the effect on the level of circ-ITCH mRNA 
expression in BC tissues as well as the level of β-catenin in BC patients.
