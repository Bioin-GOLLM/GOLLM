Immunotherapy has transformed lung cancer care in recent years. In addition to 
providing durable responses and prolonged survival outcomes for a subset of 
patients with heavily pretreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)- either as monotherapy or in combination with other 
ICIs or chemotherapy-have demonstrated benefits in first-line therapy for 
advanced disease, the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, as well as in 
additional thoracic malignancies such as small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 
mesothelioma. Challenging questions remain, however, on topics including therapy 
selection, appropriate biomarker-based identification of patients who may derive 
benefit, the use of immunotherapy in special populations such as people with 
autoimmune disorders, and toxicity management. Patient and caregiver education 
and support for quality of life (QOL) is also important to attain maximal 
benefit with immunotherapy. To provide guidance to the oncology community on 
these and other important concerns, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 
(SITC) convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a clinical 
practice guideline (CPG). This CPG represents an update to SITC's 2018 
publication on immunotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, and is expanded to 
include recommendations on SCLC and mesothelioma. The Expert Panel drew on the 
published literature as well as their clinical experience to develop 
recommendations for healthcare professionals on these important aspects of 
immunotherapeutic treatment for lung cancer and mesothelioma, including 
diagnostic testing, treatment planning, immune-related adverse events, and 
patient QOL considerations. The evidence- and consensus-based recommendations in 
this CPG are intended to give guidance to cancer care providers using 
immunotherapy to treat patients with lung cancer or mesothelioma.
