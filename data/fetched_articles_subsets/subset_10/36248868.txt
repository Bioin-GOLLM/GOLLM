BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) is a homodimeric, extracellular enzyme 
and putative growth factor that is produced by cells of the myeloid lineage and, 
catalytically, deaminates extracellular adenosine to inosine. 
Loss-of-(catalytic)-function variants in the ADA2 gene are associated with 
Deficiency of ADA2 (DADA2), an autosomal recessive disease associated with an 
unusually broad range of inflammatory manifestations including vasculitis, 
hematological defects and cytopenia. Previous work by our group led to the 
identification of ADA2 variants of novel association with DADA2, among which was 
a unique c.1052T>A (p.Leu351Gln; herein referred to as L351Q) variant located in 
the catalytic domain of the protein.
METHODS: Mammalian (Flp-IN CHO) cells were engineered to stably express 
wild-type ADA2 and ADA2 protein variants, including the pathogenic L351Q variant 
identified in DADA2 patients. An enzyme assay and immunoblotting were used to 
assess ADA2 catalytic activity and secretion, respectively, and the outcome of 
experimentally induced inhibition of protein processing (Golgi transport and 
N-linked glycosylation) was assessed. Reverse transcription quantitative 
real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was applied to determine the relative expression of Type 
I Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), IFIT3 and IRF7.
RESULTS: In addition to abrogating catalytic activity, the L351Q variant 
impaired secretion of L351Q ADA2 resulting in an intracellular accumulation of 
L351Q ADA2 protein that was not observed in cells expressing wild-type ADA2 or 
other ADA2 protein variants. Retention of L351Q ADA2 was not attributable to 
impaired glycosylation on neighboring asparagine residues and did not impact 
cell growth or integrity. Constitutive expression of Type I ISGs IFIT3 and IRF7 
was observed in cells expressing L351Q ADA2.
CONCLUSIONS: The impaired secretion of L351Q ADA2 may be an important factor 
leading to the severe phenotype observed in patients with this variant further 
emphasizing the importance of assessing impacts beyond catalytic activity when 
evaluating genotype-phenotype relationships in DADA2.
