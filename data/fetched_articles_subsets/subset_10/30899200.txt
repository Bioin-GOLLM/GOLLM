BACKGROUND: Emergence of resistance to molecular targeted therapy constitutes a 
limitation to clinical benefits in cancer treatment. Cross-resistance commonly 
happens with chemotherapeutic agents but might not with targeted agents.
METHODS: In the current study, TP53 wild-type cell lines with druggable MAPK 
pathway mutations [BRAF V600E (WM35) or NRAS Q61K (SJSA-1)] were compared with 
their TP53 mutant sublines (WM35-R, SN40R2) derived by selection for resistance 
to MDM2/p53 binding antagonists.
RESULTS: The continued presence of the druggable MAPK pathway targets in the 
TP53 mutant (TP53 MUT) WM35-R and SN40R2 cells was confirmed. Trametinib and 
vemurafenib were tested on the paired WM35/WM35-R and SJSA-1/SN40R2 cells and 
similar growth inhibitory effects on the paired cell lines was observed. 
However, apoptotic responses to trametinib and vemurafenib were greater in WM35 
than WM35-R, evidenced by FACS analysis and caspase 3/7 activity, indicating 
that these MAPK inhibitors acted on the cells partially through p53-regulated 
pathways. SiRNA mediated p53 knockdown in WM35 replicated the same pattern of 
response to trametinib and vemurafenib as seen in WM35-R, confirming that p53 
plays a role in trametinib and vemurafenib induced apoptosis. In contrast, these 
differences in apoptotic response between WM35 and WM35-R were not seen with the 
SJSA-1/SN40R2 cell line pair. This is likely due to p53 suppression by 
overexpressed MDM2 in SJSA-1.
CONCLUSION: The TP53MUT cells selected by resistance to MDM2 inhibitors 
nevertheless retained growth inhibitory but not apoptotic response to MAPK 
pathway inhibitors.
