Adenylate kinases (AKs) are phosphotransferases that regulate the cellular 
adenine nucleotide composition and play a critical role in the energy 
homeostasis of all tissues. The AK2 isoenzyme is expressed in the mitochondrial 
intermembrane space and is mutated in reticular dysgenesis (RD), a rare form of 
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in humans. RD is characterized by a 
maturation arrest in the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, leading to early onset, 
recurrent, and overwhelming infections. To gain insight into the pathophysiology 
of RD, we studied the effects of AK2 deficiency using the zebrafish model and 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from fibroblasts of an RD 
patient. In zebrafish, Ak2 deficiency affected hematopoietic stem and progenitor 
cell (HSPC) development with increased oxidative stress and apoptosis. 
AK2-deficient iPSCs recapitulated the characteristic myeloid maturation arrest 
at the promyelocyte stage and demonstrated an increased AMP/ADP ratio, 
indicative of an energy-depleted adenine nucleotide profile. Antioxidant 
treatment rescued the hematopoietic phenotypes in vivo in ak2 mutant zebrafish 
and restored differentiation of AK2-deficient iPSCs into mature granulocytes. 
Our results link hematopoietic cell fate in AK2 deficiency to cellular energy 
depletion and increased oxidative stress. This points to the potential use of 
antioxidants as a supportive therapeutic modality for patients with RD.
