OBJECTIVE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) dysregulation is widely 
related with various psychiatric and neurological disorders, including 
schizophrenia, depression, Rett syndrome, and addiction, and the available 
evidence suggests that BDNF is also highly correlated with Parkinson's and 
Alzheimer's diseases.
METHODS: The BDNF target sequence was detected on a capture probe attached on 
aluminum microcomb electrodes on the silicon wafer surface. A 
capture-target-reporter sandwich-type assay was performed to enhance the 
detection of the BDNF target.
RESULTS: The limit of detection was noticed to be 100 aM. Input of a reporter 
sequence at concentrations >10 aM improved the detection of the target sequence 
by enhancing changes in the generated currents. Control experiments with 
noncomplementary and single- and triple-mismatches of target and reporter 
sequences did not elicit changes in current levels, indicating the selective 
detection of the BDNF gene sequence.
CONCLUSION: The above detection strategy will be useful for the detection and 
quantification of BDNF, thereby aiding in the provision of suitable treatments 
for BDNF-related disorders.
