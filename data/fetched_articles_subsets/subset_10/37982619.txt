An overexpression screen of 228 zinc cluster transcription factor encoding genes 
of A. fumigatus revealed 11 genes conferring increased tolerance to antifungal 
drugs. Out of these, four oxidative stress and drug tolerance transcription 
factor encoding odr genes increased tolerance to oxidative stress and antifungal 
drugs when overexpressed. This supports a correlation between oxidative stress 
response and antifungal drug tolerance in A. fumigatus. OdrA/Mdu2 is required 
for the cross-tolerance between azoles, polyenes, and oxidative stress and 
activates genes for detoxification. Under oxidative stress conditions or when 
overexpressed, OdrA/Mdu2 accumulates in the nucleus and activates detoxifying 
genes by direct binding at their promoters, as we describe with the mdr1 gene 
encoding an itraconazole specific efflux pump. Finally, this work gives new 
insights about drug and stress resistance in the opportunistic pathogenic fungus 
A. fumigatus.
