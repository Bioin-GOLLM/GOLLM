BACKGROUND: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is characterized by an 
autosomal dominant mode of inheritance; a primary defect in insulin secretion 
with non-ketotic hyperglycemia, age of onset under 25 yr; and lack of 
autoantibodies. Heterozygous mutations in glucokinase (GCK) are associated with 
mild fasting hyperglycemia and gestational diabetes mellitus while homozygous or 
compound heterozygous GCK mutations result in permanent neonatal diabetes 
mellitus. Given that both the Israeli-Arabic and the various Israeli-Jewish 
communities tend to maintain ethnic seclusion, we speculated that it would be 
possible to identify a relatively narrow spectrum of mutations in the Israeli 
population.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the genetic basis of GCK-MODY in the different ethnic 
groups of the Israeli population.
SUBJECTS: Patients with clinically identified GCK-MODY and their first degree 
family members.
METHODS: Molecular analysis of GCK was performed on genomic DNA using polymerase 
chain reaction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and sequencing. 
Bioinformatic model was preformed using the NEST program.
RESULTS: Mutations in GCK were identified in 25 families and were all 
family-specific, except c.616A>C. p.T206P. This mutation was identified in six 
unrelated families, all patients from a Jewish-Ashkenazi descent, thus 
indicating an ethno-genetic correlation. A simple, fast, and relatively cheap 
DGGE/restriction-digestion assay was developed.
CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of the mutant allele in GCK-MODY patients of 
Jewish-Ashkenazi descent suggests a founder effect. We propose that clinically 
identified GCK-MODY patients of Jewish-Ashkenazi origin be first tested for this 
mutation.
