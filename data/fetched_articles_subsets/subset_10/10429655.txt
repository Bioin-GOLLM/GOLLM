Germline mutations of the STK11 gene lead to emergence of hamartomas in the 
gastrointestinal tract of patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, who bear an 
increased risk of malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, genital tract, and 
other organs. We analyzed 80 sporadic colorectal cancers, six small-intestinal 
cancers, and 40 gastric cancers for somatic mutations of STK11 by SSCP methods. 
Among them only one colorectal cancer, which showed a phenotype of 
microsatellite instability, was found to possess a deleterious mutation in this 
gene, a frameshift involving deletion of one base at codons 279-281. This region 
of the gene contains a mononucleotide-repeat sequence, CCCCCC. The other allele 
of STK11 had been lost in this tumor. If the STK11 gene is one of the mutational 
targets of microsatellite instability, its inactivation may be associated with 
tumor development in a small proportion of colorectal cancers.
