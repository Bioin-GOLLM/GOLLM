AIMS/INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to examine the associations 
of rs2241766 (+45T>G), rs1501299 (+276G>T), rs17300539 (-11391G>A) and rs182052 
(-10069G>A) in the adiponectin (Ad) gene with adiponectin concentrations, and 
concomitantly the association of these variants with cardiometabolic risk in 
type 2 diabetic patients of African ancestry.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 200 patients was carried out. 
Concentrations of total, high (HMW), middle (MMW) and low (LMW) molecular weight 
adiponectin isoforms were measured. The four polymorphisms were genotyped.
RESULTS: Decreased values were noted for total Ad in overweight, dyslipidemia 
and coronary artery disease (CAD), for HMW in overweight and dyslipidemia, for 
MMW in CAD, for LMW in dyslipidemia and CAD, for the percentage HMW/total in 
overweight, and for MMW:HMW ratio in patients without hypertriglyceridemic waist 
(HTGW). Significant associations were noted between total Ad, HMW, and HMW/total 
Ad and rs182052 under a dominant model (P = 0.04, P = 0.03 and P = 0.04, 
respectively), and between MMW and rs17300539 (P = 0.006). No significant 
difference in adiponectin concentrations was noted according to rs2241766 and 
rs1501299 genotypes. Patients carrying the rs2241766 G allele (TG+GG) had an 
increased risk of HTGW (odds ratio [OR] 3.1; P = 0.04) and of CAD (OR 3.3; 
P = 0.01). The odds of having low total adiponectin concentrations (<25th 
percentile: 3.49 ng/mL) for carrying the rs182052A allele (AA+GA) was: OR 0.40; 
P = 0.009. The single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with adiponectin levels 
was not concomitantly associated with cardiometabolic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin concentrations and ADIPOQ variants are implicated in 
the pathophysiological process leading to cardiovascular diseases, but the 
genetic effects seem to be independent of adiponectin concentrations in our 
Afro-Caribbean diabetic patients.
