INTRODUCTION: Overexpression of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) 
receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, can propel the growth of cancer cells and 
portends poor prognoses for patients with lung cancer. Evaluation of MET by 
immunohistochemistry is challenging, with MET protein overexpression varying 
from 20% to 80% between lung cancer cohorts. Clinical trials using MET protein 
expression to select patients have also reported a wide range of positivity 
rates and outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To overcome this variability, the Lung Cancer Mutation 
Consortium Pathologist Panel endeavored to standardize the evaluation of MET 
protein expression with "Round Robin" conferences. This panel used randomly 
selected Aperio-scanned formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung cancer specimens 
stained by MET immunohistochemistry for the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium 2.0 
study (N=838). Seven pathologists in separate laboratories scored images of 5 
initial cases and 2 subsequent rounds of 39 cases. The pathologists' scores were 
compared for consistency using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Issues 
affecting reproducibility were discussed in Round Robin conferences between 
rounds, and steps were taken to improve scoring consistency, such as sharing 
reference materials and example images.
RESULTS: The overall group intraclass correlation coefficient comparing the 
consistency of scoring improved from 0.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.64) 
for the first scoring round to 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.83) for the 
second round.
DISCUSSION: We found that the consistency of MET immunohistochemistry scoring is 
improved by continuous training and communication between pathologists.
