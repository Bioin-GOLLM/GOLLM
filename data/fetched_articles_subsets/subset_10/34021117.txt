Depression is the most prevalent mental disorder with substantial morbidity and 
mortality. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified 
multiple risk variants for depression, due to the complicated gene regulatory 
mechanisms and complexity of linkage disequilibrium (LD), the biological 
mechanisms by which the risk variants exert their effects on depression remain 
largely unknown. Here, we perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) 
of depression by integrating GWAS summary statistics from 807,553 individuals 
(246,363 depression cases and 561,190 controls) and summary-level 
gene-expression data (from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 1003 
individuals). We identified 53 transcriptome-wide significant (TWS) risk genes 
for depression, of which 23 genes were not implicated in risk loci of the 
original GWAS. Seven out of 53 risk genes (B3GALTL, FADS1, TCTEX1D1, XPNPEP3, 
ZMAT2, ZNF501 and ZNF502) showed TWS associations with depression in two 
independent brain expression quantitative loci (eQTL) datasets, suggesting that 
these genes may represent promising candidates. We further conducted conditional 
analyses and identified the potential risk genes that driven the TWAS 
association signal in each locus. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis revealed 
biologically pathways relevant to depression. Our study identified new 
depression risk genes whose expression dysregulation may play a role in 
depression. More importantly, we translated the GWAS associations into risk 
genes and relevant pathways. Further mechanistic study and functional 
characterization of the TWS depression risk genes will facilitate the 
diagnostics and therapeutics for depression.
