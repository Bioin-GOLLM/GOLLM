BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), rapidly increasing to epidemic 
proportions, globally escalates cardiovascular disease risk. Although intensive 
interventions and comprehensive management of environmental risks factors for 
T2D are associated with reduced cardiovascular disease, such approaches are 
limited for individuals with high genetic T2D risk. In this study we 
investigated possible associations of ACE2 polymorphisms and cardiovascular 
risks in Uygur patients with T2D.
METHODS: 275 Uygur T2D patients and 272 non-diabetic Uygur individuals were 
enrolled as study participants. 14 ACE2 polymorphisms were genotyped by 
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: ACE2 SNP rs1978124, rs2048683, rs2074192, rs233575, rs4240157, 
rs4646156, rs4646188 and rs879922 were associated with T2D (all P < 0.05). The 8 
diabetic risk related ACE2 SNPs were further associated with diabetic related 
cardiovascular complications or events but exhibited heterogeneity as fellows: 
firstly, almost all diabetic risk related ACE2 SNPs (all P < 0.05) were 
associated with increased SBP except rs1978124 and rs2074192, while rs2074192, 
rs4646188 and rs879922 were associated elevated DBP (all P < 0.05). Secondly, 
SNP rs4646188 was not correlated with any type of dyslipidemia (TRIG, HDL-C, 
LDL-C or CHOL), and the other 7 diabetic risk related loci were at least 
correlated with one type of dyslipidemia (all P < 0.05). In particular, rs879922 
were simultaneously correlated with four type of dyslipidemia (all P < 0.05). 
Thirdly, ACE2 SNP rs2074192 and rs879922 were associated with carotid 
arteriosclerosis stenosis (CAS) ≥ 50% (both P < 0.05). Fourthly, ACE2 SNP 
rs2074192, rs4240157, rs4646188 and 879922 were associated with increased MAU 
(all P < 0.05). In addition, ACE2 SNP rs2048683, rs4240157, rs4646156, rs4646188 
and rs879922 were linked to heavier LVMI (all P < 0.05), but only rs4240157, 
rs4646156 and rs4646188 were associated with lower LVEF (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: ACE2 SNP rs879922 may be a common genetic loci and optimal genetic 
susceptibility marker for T2D and T2D related cardiovascular risks in Uygurs.
