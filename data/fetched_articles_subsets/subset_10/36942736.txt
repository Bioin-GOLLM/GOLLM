The etiology of biliary atresia (BA) is unknown, but recent studies suggest a 
role for rare protein-altering variants (PAVs). Exome sequencing data from the 
National Birth Defects Prevention Study on 54 child-parent trios, one 
child-mother duo, and 1513 parents of children with other birth defects were 
analyzed. Most (91%) cases were isolated BA. We performed (1) a trio-based 
analysis to identify rare de novo, homozygous, and compound heterozygous PAVs 
and (2) a case-control analysis using a sequence kernel-based association test 
to identify genes enriched with rare PAVs. While we replicated previous findings 
on PKD1L1, our results do not suggest that recurrent de novo PAVs play important 
roles in BA susceptibility. In fact, our finding in NOTCH2, a disease gene 
associated with Alagille syndrome, highlights the difficulty in BA diagnosis. 
Notably, IFRD2 has been implicated in other gastrointestinal conditions and 
warrants additional study. Overall, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that 
the etiology of BA is complex.
