Alphaviruses, members of the positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus family 
Togaviridae, represent a re-emerging public health concern worldwide as mosquito 
vectors expand into new geographic ranges. Members of the alphavirus genus tend 
to induce clinical disease characterized by rash, arthralgia, and arthritis 
(chikungunya virus, Ross River virus, and Semliki Forest virus) or 
encephalomyelitis (eastern equine encephalitis virus, western equine 
encephalitis virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), though some 
patients who recover from the initial acute illness may develop long-term 
sequelae, regardless of the specific infecting virus. Studies examining the 
natural disease course in humans and experimental infection in cell culture and 
animal models reveal that host genetics play a major role in influencing 
susceptibility to infection and severity of clinical disease. Genome-wide 
genetic screens, including loss of function screens, microarrays, 
RNA-sequencing, and candidate gene studies, have further elucidated the role 
host genetics play in the response to virus infection, with the immune response 
being found in particular to majorly influence the outcome. This review 
describes the current knowledge of the mechanisms by which host genetic factors 
influence alphavirus pathogenesis and discusses emerging technologies that are 
poised to increase our understanding of the complex interplay between viral and 
host genetics on disease susceptibility and clinical outcome.
