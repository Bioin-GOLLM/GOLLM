BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus, the commonest metabolic disorder, leads to 
cardiovascular diseases, neurological problems, kidney injury, and visual 
disturbances. Such complications can be prevented by maintaining plasma glucose 
level in the normal range, including ophthalmic complications. Hence, this study 
intended to pinpoint predictors of poor plasma glucose maintenance in type II DM 
people with ophthalmic complication.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using simple random sampling 
approach to recruit participants. An interviewer-based questionnaire was used 
and ophthalmic complication was determined by visual acuity test. We used 
statistical package for social sciences version 23 to analyze the data and 
descriptive statistics were calculated. Predictors were ascertained using 
multivariable logistic regression at p≤0.05. Besides, AOR with 95% CI was also 
estimated to show extent of association.
RESULTS: The prevalence of poor plasma glucose maintenance was 65.1% 
(56.6-73.6). Poor plasma maintenance was predicted by the absence of formal 
education (OR: 0.67; 0.20-2.23), DM history of family members (OR=4.29; 
1.33-13.83), longer duration of diabetes (OR: 3.02; 1.09-8.63), insulin use 
(OR=10.05; 2.72-52.35), and less physical exercise (OR=2.91; 1.47-5.76).
CONCLUSION: Study subjects with no education, DM history of family members, 
prolonged DM, insulin medication, and inadequate exercise had higher rate of 
poor plasma glucose maintenance. Health professionals should educate patients on 
the importance of self-adherence to plasma glucose monitoring, and encourage 
them to practice recommended physical activity.
