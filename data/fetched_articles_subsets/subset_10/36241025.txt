BACKGROUND: Vagal reflexes regulate homeostasis in visceral organs and systems 
through afferent and efferent neurons and nerve fibers. Small, unmyelinated, 
C-type afferents comprise over 80% of fibers in the vagus and form the sensory 
arc of autonomic reflexes of the gut, lungs, heart and vessels and the immune 
system. Selective bioelectronic activation of C-afferents could be used to 
mechanistically study and treat diseases of peripheral organs in which vagal 
reflexes are involved, but it has not been achieved.
METHODS: We stimulated the vagus in rats and mice using trains of kHz-frequency 
stimuli. Stimulation effects were assessed using neuronal c-Fos expression, 
physiological and nerve fiber responses, optogenetic and computational methods.
RESULTS: Intermittent kHz stimulation for 30 min activates specific motor and, 
preferentially, sensory vagus neurons in the brainstem. At sufficiently high 
frequencies (>5 kHz) and at intensities within a specific range (7-10 times 
activation threshold, T, in rats; 15-25 × T in mice), C-afferents are activated, 
whereas larger, A- and B-fibers, are blocked. This was determined by measuring 
fiber-specific acute physiological responses to kHz stimulus trains, and by 
assessing fiber excitability around kHz stimulus trains through compound action 
potentials evoked by probing pulses. Aspects of selective activation of 
C-afferents are explained in computational models of nerve fibers by how fiber 
size and myelin shape the response of sodium channels to kHz-frequency stimuli.
CONCLUSION: kHz stimulation is a neuromodulation strategy to robustly and 
selectively activate vagal C-afferents implicated in physiological homeostasis 
and disease, over larger vagal fibers.
