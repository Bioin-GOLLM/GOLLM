The pathogenesis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is strongly linked 
to dysregulation of the alternative pathway of the complement system. Mutations 
in complement genes have been identified in about two-thirds of cases, with 5% 
to 15% being in C3. In this study, 23 aHUS-associated genetic changes in C3 were 
characterized relative to their interaction with the control proteins factor H 
(FH), membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46), and complement receptor 1 (CR1; 
CD35). In surface plasmon resonance experiments, 17 mutant recombinant proteins 
demonstrated a defect in binding to FH and/or MCP, whereas 2 demonstrated 
reduced binding to CR1. In the majority of cases, decreased binding affinity 
translated to a decrease in proteolytic inactivation (known as cofactor 
activity) of C3b via FH and MCP. These results were used to map the putative 
binding regions of C3b involved in the interaction with MCP and CR1 and 
interrogated relative to known FH binding sites. Seventy-six percent of patients 
with C3 mutations had low C3 levels that correlated with disease severity. This 
study expands our knowledge of the functional consequences of aHUS-associated C3 
mutations relative to the interaction of C3 with complement regulatory proteins 
mediating cofactor activity.
