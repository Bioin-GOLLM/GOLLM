BACKGROUND: Labor epidural analgesia has been suggested to be associated with 
intrapartum fever. We designed this study to investigate the effects of epidural 
analgesia and combined spinal-epidural analgesia on maternal intrapartum 
temperature.
METHODS: Four hundred healthy nullipara patients were randomly assigned to 
receive either epidural analgesia (EA group) or combined spinal-epidural 
analgesia (CSEA group). Maternal temperature was measured hourly after analgesia 
administration. The primary outcome was the incidence of maternal fever, and the 
secondary outcomes were the duration of analgesia, analgesia to full cervical 
dilation and analgesia to delivery. Neonatal outcomes and other basic labor 
events were also recorded.
RESULTS: Maternal temperature gradually increased with time in both analgesia 
groups during labor. However, the CSEA group had a lower incidence of maternal 
fever, and a lower mean maternal temperature at 5 h, 6 h, and 9 h after 
analgesia. In addtion, the CSEA group also had a shorter time of analgesia 
duration, analgesia to full cervical dilation, analgesia to delivery, and less 
dose of epidural local anesthetic than the EA group.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that combined spinal-epidural analgesia is 
associated with a lower risk of intrapartum fever than epidural analgesia.
