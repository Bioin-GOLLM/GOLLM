BACKGROUND: The guanine to adenine transition at position -308 nucleotides in 
the tumour necrosis factor promoter region (TNF -308A) is a putative genetic 
risk factor for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (PE/E). However, association studies 
have reported conflicting findings and have generally been underpowered to 
exclude modest effect sizes.
AIM: To assess and synthesise the available evidence for the association of the 
TNF (-308A) polymorphism with PE/E.
METHODS: Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of genetic 
association studies.
RESULTS: Sixteen eligible case-control studies in which a total of 1919 patients 
with PE/E and 2374 controls participated were identified. The studies were 
generally small but of reasonable methodological quality. Random effects 
meta-analysis improved the precision of the estimate of effect size but did not 
detect a statistically significant association: pooled relative risk 1.02 (95% 
confidence interval 0.86 to 1.20).
CONCLUSIONS: The available data are not consistent with more than a very modest 
association between the TNF (-308A) allele and PE/E. Screening pregnant women 
for this allele in order to guide antenatal surveillance or treatment is 
unwarranted. Future research efforts should focus on alternative candidate 
genes.
