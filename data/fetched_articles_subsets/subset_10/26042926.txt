AIMS: To analyse blood glucose control according to continuous glucose 
monitoring use in data from the CareLink database, and to identify factors 
associated with continuation of sensor use during sensor-augmented pump therapy.
METHODS: The analysis used data from 10 501 people with Type 1 and 2 diabetes 
mellitus, of whom 7916 (61.7%) had used glucose sensors for ≥ 15 days during any 
6-month period over a 2-year observation period. Data were analysed according to 
the extent of sensor use ( < 25%, 25-49%, 50-74% and ≥ 75% of the time). Time to 
discontinuation of sensor use was also analysed in new users of glucose sensors.
RESULTS: Compared with patients in the lowest sensor usage group and non-users, 
the highest glucose sensor usage group had significantly (P < 0.0001) lower mean 
blood glucose and blood glucose sd, were more likely to achieve a mean blood 
glucose concentration < 8.6 mmol/l, (odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7; P < 
0.0001), and had 50% fewer hypoglycaemic (blood glucose concentration < 2.8 
mmol/l) episodes. Among new users, sensor use during the first month of therapy 
was an important predictor of subsequent discontinuation. Lack of full 
reimbursement was also significantly associated with early discontinuation, 
whereas measures of glycaemic control were predictive of discontinuation during 
long-term treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of continuous glucose monitoring was significantly 
associated with reductions in hypoglycaemia and improved metabolic control 
during insulin pump therapy. Sensor use during the first month was strongly 
associated with long-term adherence; patient education and training may be 
helpful in achieving this.
