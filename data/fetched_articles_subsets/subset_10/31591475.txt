Differentiating between inherited renal hypouricemia and transient hypouricemic 
status is challenging. Here, we aimed to describe the genetic background of 
hypouricemia patients using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and assess the 
feasibility for genetic diagnosis using two founder variants in primary 
screening. We selected all cases (N = 31) with extreme hypouricemia (<1.3 mg/dl) 
from a Korean urban cohort of 179,381 subjects without underlying conditions. 
WES and corresponding downstream analyses were performed for the discovery of 
rare causal variants for hypouricemia. Two known recessive variants within 
SLC22A12 (p.Trp258*, pArg90His) were identified in 24 out of 31 subjects 
(77.4%). In an independent cohort, we identified 50 individuals with 
hypouricemia and genotyped the p.Trp258* and p.Arg90His variants; 47 of the 50 
(94%) hypouricemia cases were explained by only two mutations. Four novel coding 
variants in SLC22A12, p.Asn136Lys, p.Thr225Lys, p.Arg284Gln, and p.Glu429Lys, 
were additionally identified. In silico studies predict these as pathogenic 
variants. This is the first study to show the value of genetic diagnostic 
screening for hypouricemia in the clinical setting. Screening of just two 
ethnic-specific variants (p.Trp258* and p.Arg90His) identified 87.7% (71/81) of 
Korean patients with monogenic hypouricemia. Early genetic identification of 
constitutive hypouricemia may prevent acute kidney injury by avoidance of 
dehydration and excessive exercise.
