OBJECTIVES: The aim of this phase 1/2 study was to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of olmutinib in patients 
with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) who had failed ≥ 1 previous line of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) 
therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phase 1 consisted of dose-escalation and four 
dose-expansion parts (1: olmutinib 300 mg once daily; 2A: 800 mg once daily 
[EGFR T790 M mutation-positive patients]; 2B: 500 mg twice daily [EGFR T790 M 
mutation-positive]; 3: 800 mg once daily [EGFR T790 M mutation-negative]). In 
phase 2, EGFR T790 M mutation-positive patients received olmutinib 800 mg once 
daily. Data from expansion part 2A and phase 2 were integrated (`pooled phase 
2'). Each olmutinib cycle was 21 days. Outcomes included: tumor response, 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), pharmacokinetic parameters.
RESULTS: Overall, 272 patients received at least one olmutinib dose: 
dose-escalation (n = 66), expansion parts (n = 165), phase 2 (n = 41). In pooled 
phase 2, the overall objective response rate, confirmed by independent review, 
was 55.1% (38/69 evaluable patients; 95% CI, 42.6-67.1). All responses were 
partial responses; 23 patients had stable disease. Estimated median 
progression-free survival was 6.9 (95% CI, 5.6-9.7) months; estimated median 
overall survival was not reached. The most frequent treatment-related AEs were 
diarrhea (59.2% of patients), pruritus (42.1%), rash (40.8%), and nausea 
(39.5%).
CONCLUSION: Olmutinib showed effective clinical activity with a manageable 
safety profile, indicating therapeutic potential for T790M-positive NSCLC 
patients who have failed ≥ 1 previous line of EGFR-TKI therapy.
