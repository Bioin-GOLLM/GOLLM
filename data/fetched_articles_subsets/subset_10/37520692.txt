Millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) exist in the human genome; 
however, it remains challenging to identify functional SNVs associated with 
diseases. We propose a non-encoding SNVs analysis tool bpb3, BayesPI-BAR version 
3, aiming to identify the functional mutation blocks (FMBs) by integrating 
genome sequencing and transcriptome data. The identified FMBs display high 
frequency SNVs, significant changes in transcription factors (TFs) binding 
affinity and are nearby the regulatory regions of differentially expressed 
genes. A two-level Bayesian approach with a biophysical model for protein-DNA 
interactions is implemented, to compute TF-DNA binding affinity changes based on 
clustered position weight matrices (PWMs) from over 1700 TF-motifs. The 
epigenetic data, such as the DNA methylome can also be integrated to scan FMBs. 
By testing the datasets from follicular lymphoma and melanoma, bpb3 
automatically and robustly identifies FMBs, demonstrating that bpb3 can provide 
insight into patho-mechanisms, and therapeutic targets from transcriptomic and 
genomic data.
