The βC1 protein of tomato yellow leaf curl China β-satellite functions as a 
pathogenicity determinant. To better understand the molecular basis of βC1 in 
pathogenicity, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cDNA 
library was carried out using βC1 as bait. βC1 interacted with a tomato 
SUCROSE-NONFERMENTING1-related kinase designated as SlSnRK1. Their interaction 
was confirmed using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay in 
Nicotiana benthamiana cells. Plants overexpressing SnRK1 were delayed for 
symptom appearance and contained lower levels of viral and satellite DNA, while 
plants silenced for SnRK1 expression developed symptoms earlier and accumulated 
higher levels of viral DNA. In vitro kinase assays showed that βC1 is 
phosphorylated by SlSnRK1 mainly on serine at position 33 and threonine at 
position 78. Plants infected with βC1 mutants containing phosphorylation-mimic 
aspartate residues in place of serine-33 and/or threonine-78 displayed delayed 
and attenuated symptoms and accumulated lower levels of viral DNA, while plants 
infected with phosphorylation-negative alanine mutants contained higher levels 
of viral DNA. These results suggested that the SlSnRK1 protein attenuates 
geminivirus infection by interacting with and phosphorylating the βC1 protein.
