BRCA-ness phenotype, a signature of many breast and ovarian cancers, manifests 
as deficiency in homologous recombination, and as defects in protection and 
repair of damaged DNA replication forks. A dependence of such cancers on DNA 
repair factors less important for survival of BRCA-proficient cells, offers 
opportunities for development of novel chemotherapeutic interventions. The first 
drugs targeting BRCA-deficient cancers, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) 
inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of advanced, chemotherapy 
resistant cancers in patients with BRCA1/2 germline mutations. Nine additional 
proteins that can be targeted to selectively kill BRCA-deficient cancer cells 
have been identified. Among them, a DNA repair protein RAD52 is an especially 
attractive target due to general tolerance of the RAD52 loss of function, and 
protective role of an inactivating mutation. Yet, the effective pharmacological 
inhibitors of RAD52 have not been forthcoming. In this review, we discuss 
advances in the state of our knowledge of the RAD52 structure, activities and 
cellular functions, with a specific focus on the features that make RAD52 an 
attractive, but difficult drug target.
