Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) shows progressive loss of photoreceptors involved with 
heterogeneous genetic background. Here, by exome sequencing and linkage analysis 
on a Chinese family with autosomal dominant RP, we identified a putative 
pathogenic variant, p.Gly97Arg, in the gene SPP2, of which expression was 
detected in multiple tissues including retina. The p.Gly97Arg was absent in 800 
ethnically matched chromosomes and 1400 in-house exome dataset, and was located 
in the first of the two highly conserved disulfide bonded loop of secreted 
phosphoprotein 2 (Spp-24) encoded by SPP2. Overexpression of p.Gly97Arg and 
another signal peptide mutation, p.Gly29Asp, caused cellular retention of both 
endogenous wild type and exogenous mutants in vitro, and primarily affected rod 
photoreceptors in zebrafish mimicking cardinal feature of RP. Taken together, 
our data indicate that the two mutations of SPP2 have dominant negative effects 
and cellular accumulation of Spp-24 might be particularly toxic to 
photoreceptors and/or retinal pigment epithelium. SPP2 has a new role in retinal 
degeneration.
