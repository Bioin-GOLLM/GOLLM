To identify the genetic basis of interindividual variability in montelukast 
exposure, we determined its pharmacokinetics and sequenced 379 pharmacokinetic 
genes in 191 healthy volunteers. An intronic single nucleotide variation (SNV), 
strongly linked with UGT1A3*2, associated with reduced area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞ ) of montelukast (by 18% per copy of the minor 
allele; P = 1.83 × 10-10 ). UGT1A3*2 was associated with increased AUC0-∞ of 
montelukast acyl-glucuronide M1 and decreased AUC0-∞ of hydroxymetabolites M5R, 
M5S, and M6 (P < 10-9 ). Furthermore, SNVs in SLCO1B1 and ABCC9 were associated 
with the AUC0-∞ of M1 and M5R, respectively. In addition, a candidate gene 
analysis suggested that CYP2C8 and ABCC9 SNVs also affect the AUC0-∞ of 
montelukast. The found UGT1A3 and ABCC9 variants associated with increased 
expression of the respective genes in human liver samples. Montelukast and its 
hydroxymetabolites were glucuronidated by UGT1A3 in vitro. These results 
indicate that UGT1A3 plays an important role in montelukast pharmacokinetics, 
especially in UGT1A3*2 carriers.
