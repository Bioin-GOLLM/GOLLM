BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate whether the detection of methylation 
in the promoter of the Ras association domain family 10 gene (RASSF10) in the 
serum of patients with gastric cancer (GC) by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) can 
be used as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator of GC.
METHODS: We used MSP to examine RASSF10 methylation levels in the serum and/or 
tumor samples from 100 GC patients, 50 patients with chronic atrophic gastritis 
(CAG), and 45 healthy controls (HC). We also analyzed clinicopathological and 
follow-up data.
RESULTS: Our results showed that the rate of serum RASFF10 promoter methylation 
among patients with GC (49/100) was higher than in those with CAG (1/50) or HC 
(0/45). Moreover, the RASSF10 methylation status was consistent between serum 
and tumor tissues. GC patients with serum RASSF10 promoter methylation had 
significantly shorter overall survival and disease-free survival times than GC 
patients without serum RASSF10 promoter methylation. Multivariable Cox 
regression analysis showed that serum RASSF10 promoter methylation and lymph 
node metastasis both correlated with reduced survival in GC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Detection of the serum RASSF10 methylation status by MSP is 
feasible as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator of GC.
