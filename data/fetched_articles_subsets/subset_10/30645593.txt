Salmonella Typhimurium sequence type (ST) 313 causes invasive nontyphoidal 
Salmonella (iNTS) disease in sub-Saharan Africa, targeting susceptible HIV+, 
malarial, or malnourished individuals. An in-depth genomic comparison between 
the ST313 isolate D23580 and the well-characterized ST19 isolate 4/74 that 
causes gastroenteritis across the globe revealed extensive synteny. To 
understand how the 856 nucleotide variations generated phenotypic differences, 
we devised a large-scale experimental approach that involved the global gene 
expression analysis of strains D23580 and 4/74 grown in 16 infection-relevant 
growth conditions. Comparison of transcriptional patterns identified virulence 
and metabolic genes that were differentially expressed between D23580 versus 
4/74, many of which were validated by proteomics. We also uncovered the S. 
Typhimurium D23580 and 4/74 genes that showed expression differences during 
infection of murine macrophages. Our comparative transcriptomic data are 
presented in a new enhanced version of the Salmonella expression compendium, 
SalComD23580: http://bioinf.gen.tcd.ie/cgi-bin/salcom_v2.pl. We discovered that 
the ablation of melibiose utilization was caused by three independent SNP 
mutations in D23580 that are shared across ST313 lineage 2, suggesting that the 
ability to catabolize this carbon source has been negatively selected during 
ST313 evolution. The data revealed a novel, to our knowledge, plasmid 
maintenance system involving a plasmid-encoded CysS cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, 
highlighting the power of large-scale comparative multicondition analyses to 
pinpoint key phenotypic differences between bacterial pathovariants.
