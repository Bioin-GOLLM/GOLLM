BACKGROUND: Aberrant calcium signaling is considered one of the key mechanisms 
contributing to arrhythmias, especially in the context of heart failure. In 
human heart failure, there is significant down-regulation of the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum (SR) protein junctin, and junctin deficiency in mice is associated 
with stress-induced arrhythmias.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the increased SR 
Ca(2+) leak and arrhythmias associated with junctin ablation may be associated 
with increased calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity 
and phosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and whether 
pharmacologic inhibition of CaMKII activity may prevent these arrhythmias.
METHODS: Using a combination of biochemical, cellular, and in vivo approaches, 
we tested the ability of KN-93 to reverse aberrant CaMKII phosphorylation of 
RyR2. Specifically, we performed protein phosphorylation analysis, in vitro 
cardiomyocyte contractility and Ca(2+) kinetics, and in vivo ECG analysis in 
junctin-deficient mice.
RESULTS: In the absence of junctin, RyR2 channels displayed CaMKII-dependent 
hyperphosphorylation. Notably, CaMKII inhibition by KN-93 reduced the in vivo 
incidence of stress-induced ventricular tachycardia by 65% in junctin null mice. 
At the cardiomyocyte level, KN-93 reduced the percentage of junctin null cells 
exhibiting spontaneous Ca(2+) aftertransients and aftercontractions under stress 
conditions by 35% and 37%, respectively. At the molecular level, KN-93 blunted 
the CaMKII-mediated hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 and phospholamban under stress 
conditions.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that CaMKII inhibition is effective in preventing 
arrhythmogenesis in the setting of junctin ablation through modulation of both 
SR Ca(2+) release and uptake. Thus, it merits further investigation as promising 
molecular therapy.
