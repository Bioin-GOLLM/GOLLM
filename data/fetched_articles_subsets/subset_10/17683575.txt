BACKGROUND: Pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes is required for 
normal chromosome segregation and the exchange of genetic material via 
recombination during meiosis. Synapsis is complete at pachytene following the 
formation of a tri-partite proteinaceous structure known as the synaptonemal 
complex (SC). In yeast, HOP1 is essential for formation of the SC, and localises 
along chromosome axes during prophase I. Homologues in Arabidopsis (AtASY1), 
Brassica (BoASY1) and rice (OsPAIR2) have been isolated through analysis of 
mutants that display decreased fertility due to severely reduced synapsis of 
homologous chromosomes. Analysis of these genes has indicated that they play a 
similar role to HOP1 in pairing and formation of the SC through localisation to 
axial/lateral elements of the SC.
RESULTS: The full length wheat cDNA and genomic clone, TaASY1, has been 
isolated, sequenced and characterised. TaASY1 is located on chromosome Group 5 
and the open reading frame displays significant nucleotide sequence identity to 
OsPAIR2 (84%) and AtASY1 (63%). Transcript and protein analysis showed that 
expression is largely restricted to meiotic tissue, with elevated levels during 
the stages of prophase I when pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes 
occur. Immunolocalisation using transmission electron microscopy showed TaASY1 
interacts with chromatin that is associated with both axial elements before SC 
formation as well as lateral elements of formed SCs.
CONCLUSION: TaASY1 is a homologue of ScHOP1, AtASY1 and OsPAIR2 and is the first 
gene to be isolated from bread wheat that is involved in pairing and synapsis of 
homologous chromosomes.
