Emerging resistance against well-established anti-malaria drugs warrants the 
introduction of new therapeutic agents with original mechanisms of action. 
Inhibition of membrane-based phospholipid biosynthesis, which is crucial for the 
parasite, has thus been proposed as a novel and promising therapeutic strategy. 
This review compiles literature concerning the design and study of choline 
analogues and related cation derivatives as potential anti-malarials. It covers 
advances achieved over the last two decades and describes: the concept 
validation, the design and selection of a clinical candidate (Albitiazolium), 
back-up derivatives while also providing insight into the development of prodrug 
approaches.
