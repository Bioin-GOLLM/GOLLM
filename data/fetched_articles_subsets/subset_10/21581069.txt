4-Chloro-2-((1R)-1-{[(R)-(2-chloro-phen-yl)(cyclo-pent-yl)meth-yl]amino}eth-yl)phenol.

The title compound, C(20)H(23)Cl(2)NO, was prepared by condensation of 
(R)-1-(2-chloro-phen-yl)-1-cyclo-pentyl-methanamine with 
1-(5-chloro-2-hydroxy-phen-yl)ethanone, resulting in the formation of a new 
chiral center. The structural analysis confirms the absolute configuration of 
the title compound and the formation of the (R,R) diastereoisomer. There is an 
intra-molecular O-H⋯N hydrogen bond which stabilizes the conformation of the 
mol-ecule. The mol-ecules are linked to each other through weak C-H⋯π 
inter-actions.
