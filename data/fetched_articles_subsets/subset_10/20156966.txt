Mutations in the gene coding for DJ-1 protein lead to early-onset recessive 
forms of Parkinson's disease. It is believed that loss of DJ-1 function is 
causative for disease, although the function of DJ-1 still remains a matter of 
controversy. We show that DJ-1 is localized in the cytosol and is associated 
with membranes and organelles in the form of homodimers. The disease-related 
mutation L166P shifts its subcellular distribution to the nucleus and decreases 
its ability to dimerize, impairing cell survival. Using an intracellular foldase 
biosensor, we found that wild-type DJ-1 possesses chaperone activity, which is 
abolished by the L166P mutation. We observed that this aberrant phenotype can be 
reversed by the expression of the cochaperone BAG1 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene 
1), restoring DJ-1 subcellular distribution, dimer formation, and chaperone 
activity and ameliorating cell survival.
