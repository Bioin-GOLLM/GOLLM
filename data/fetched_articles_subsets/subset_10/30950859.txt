OBJECTIVE: There is no standard care for advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in the 
third line. Our study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of gefitinib as a 
third-line re-challenge treatment for advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR 
mutation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II 
study. Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 19del/L858R mutation, who had 
benefited from first-line gefitinib treatment followed by second-line 
chemotherapy, received gefitinib 250 mg/d. The primary objective was disease 
control rate (DCR) at week 8.
RESULTS: Predefined DCR was achieved in 69.8% (95% confidence interval, 
49.87-74.91) patients and objective response rate was reported in 4.7% (95% 
confidence interval, 0.78-13.06) patients. Median progression-free survival 
(PFS) was 4.4 months and overall survival (OS) was 10.3 months. Baseline 
T790M-negative patients achieved favorable DCR compared with T790M-positive 
patients (78.1% vs. 45.5%, P=0.0418), significantly longer median PFS (4.7 vs. 
2.0 mo, P=0.0009) and median OS (15.2 vs. 7.7 mo, P=0.0132). We observed a 
negative correlation of PFS (r=-0.4396, P=0.0032), and OS (r=-0.3630, P=0.0167) 
with mutation abundance of exon 19del/L858R at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Re-challenge with gefitinib is effective and could be a choice for 
third-line patients after the first-line EGFR-TKI treatment and second-line 
chemotherapy, especially for the T790M-negative patients.
