The ability to detect, respond and adapt to mitochondrial stress ensures the 
development and survival of organisms. Caenorhabditis elegans responds to 
mitochondrial stress by activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response 
(UPRmt) to buffer the mitochondrial folding environment, rewire the metabolic 
state, and promote innate immunity and lifespan extension. Here we show that 
HDA-1, the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian histone deacetylase (HDAC) is 
required for mitochondrial stress-mediated activation of UPRmt. HDA-1 interacts 
and coordinates with the genome organizer DVE-1 to induce the transcription of a 
broad spectrum of UPRmt, innate immune response and metabolic reprogramming 
genes. In rhesus monkey and human tissues, HDAC1/2 transcript levels correlate 
with the expression of UPRmt genes. Knocking down or pharmacological inhibition 
of HDAC1/2 disrupts the activation of the UPRmt and the mitochondrial network in 
mammalian cells. Our results underscore an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of 
HDAC1/2 in modulating mitochondrial homeostasis and regulating longevity.
