The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant of concern (VOC) was often associated with serious 
clinical course of the COVID-19 disease. Herein, we investigated the selective 
pressure, gene flow and evaluation on the frequencies of mutations causing amino 
acid substitutions in the Delta variant in three Italian regions. A total of 
1500 SARS-CoV-2 Delta genomes, collected in Italy from April to October 2021 
were investigated, including a subset of 596 from three Italian regions. The 
selective pressure and the frequency of amino acid substitutions and the 
prediction of their possible impact on the stability of the proteins were 
investigated. Delta variant dataset, in this study, identified 68 sites under 
positive selection: 16 in the spike (23.5%), 11 in nsp2 (16.2%) and 10 in nsp12 
(14.7%) genes. Three of the positive sites in the spike were located in the 
receptor-binding domain (RBD). In Delta genomes from the three regions, 6 
changes were identified as very common (>83.7%), 4 as common (>64.0%), 21 at low 
frequency (2.1%-25.0%) and 29 rare (≤2.0%). The detection of positive selection 
on key mutations may represent a model to identify recurrent signature mutations 
of the virus.
