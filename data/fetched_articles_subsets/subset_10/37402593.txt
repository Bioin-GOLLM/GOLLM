In Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), onset of programmed cell death is marked 
with the activation of CED-3, a process that requires assembly of the CED-4 
apoptosome. Activated CED-3 forms a holoenzyme with the CED-4 apoptosome to 
cleave a wide range of substrates, leading to irreversible cell death. Despite 
decades of investigations, the underlying mechanism of CED-4-facilitated CED-3 
activation remains elusive. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the CED-4 
apoptosome and three distinct CED-4/CED-3 complexes that mimic different 
activation stages for CED-3. In addition to the previously reported octamer in 
crystal structures, CED-4, alone or in complex with CED-3, exists in multiple 
oligomeric states. Supported by biochemical analyses, we show that the conserved 
CARD-CARD interaction promotes CED-3 activation, and initiation of programmed 
cell death is regulated by the dynamic organization of the CED-4 apoptosome.
