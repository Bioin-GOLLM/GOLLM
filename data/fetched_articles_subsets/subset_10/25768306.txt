Hypofunction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) has 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Here, we investigated the 
significance of a common human genetic variation of the NMDAR NR3B subunit that 
inserts 4 bases within the coding region (insCGTT) in the pathogenesis of 
schizophrenia. The cDNA carrying this polymorphism generates a truncated 
protein, which is electrophysiologically non-functional in heterologous 
expression systems. Among 586 schizophrenia patients and 754 healthy controls, 
insCGTT was significantly overrepresented in patients compared to controls (odds 
ratio = 1.37, p = 0.035). Among 121 schizophrenia patients and 372 healthy 
controls, genetic analyses of normal individuals revealed that those carrying 
insCGTT have a predisposition to schizotypal personality traits (F1,356 = 4.69, 
p = 0.031). Furthermore, pre-pulse inhibition, a neurobiological trait disturbed 
in patients with schizophrenia, was significantly impaired in patients carrying 
insCGTT compared with those with the major allele (F1,116 = 5.72, p = 0.018, 
F1,238 = 4.46, p = 0.036, respectively). These results indicate that a naturally 
occurring null variant in NR3B could be a risk factor of schizophrenia.
