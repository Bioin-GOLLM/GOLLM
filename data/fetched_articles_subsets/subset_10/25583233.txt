BACKGROUND: Pig aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1) belongs to AKR 
superfamily which catalyzes the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of various 
substrates including steroid hormones. Previously we have reported two 
paralogous pig AKR1C1s, wild-type AKR1C1 (C-type) and C-terminal-truncated 
AKR1C1 (T-type). Also, the C-terminal region significantly contributes to the 
NADPH-dependent reductase activity for 5α-DHT reduction. Molecular modeling 
studies combined with kinetic experiments were performed to investigate 
structural and enzymatic differences between wild-type AKR1C1 C-type and T-type.
RESULTS: The results of the enzyme kinetics revealed that Vmax and kcat values 
of the T-type were 2.9 and 1.6 folds higher than those of the C-type. Moreover, 
catalytic efficiency was also 1.9 fold higher in T-type compared to C-type. 
Since x-ray crystal structures of pig AKR1C1 were not available, three 
dimensional structures of the both types of the protein were predicted using 
homology modeling methodology and they were used for molecular dynamics 
simulations. The structural comparisons between C-type and T-type showed that 
5α-DHT formed strong hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues such as Tyr55 and 
His117 in T-type. In particular, C3 ketone group of the substrate was close to 
Tyr55 and NADPH in T-type.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that 5α-DHT binding in T-type was more favorable 
for catalytic reaction to facilitate hydride transfer from the cofactor, and 
were consistent with experimental results. We believe that our study provides 
valuable information to understand important role of C-terminal region that 
affects enzymatic properties for 5α-DHT, and further molecular mechanism for the 
enzyme kinetics of AKR1C1 proteins.
