For cardiac transplant (CTx) recipients, the recommended everolimus (EVL) dose 
is 0.75 mg bid or 1.5 mg bid and the target trough blood level is 3-8 μg/L. We 
studied a cohort of 56 CTx patients with chronic kidney disease receiving 
0.75 mg bid EVL to maintain blood levels of 5-8 ug/L (designated RD group) and a 
cohort of 51 CTx patients with chronic kidney disease receiving 0.5 mg bid to 
maintain blood levels of 3-5 ug/L (designated LD group). The primary endpoint 
was a composite of death, rejection and premature EVL discontinuation up to 1 
year after introduction of EVL. The primary endpoint was reached by 32% of 
patients in the LD group and by 41.1% of patients in the RD group (P = 0.361). 
Biochemical safety parameters were comparable in both groups. Our results 
indicate that low-dose EVL may be as effective and safe as regular dose EVL.
