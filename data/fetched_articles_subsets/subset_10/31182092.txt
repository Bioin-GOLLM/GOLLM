Sarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by the development of 
granulomas in various organs, especially in the lungs and lymph nodes. Clinics 
of the disease largely depends on the organ involved and may range from mild 
symptoms to life threatening manifestations. Over the last two decades, 
significant advances in the diagnosis, clinical assessment and treatment of 
sarcoidosis have been achieved, however, the precise etiology of this disease 
remains unknown. Current evidence suggests that, in genetically predisposed 
individuals, an excessive immune response to unknown antigen/s is crucial for 
the development of sarcoidosis. Epidemiological and microbiological studies 
suggest that, at least in a fraction of patients, microbes or their products may 
trigger the immune response leading to sarcoid granuloma formation. In this 
article, we discuss the scientific evidence on the interaction of microbes with 
immune cells that may be implicated in the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis, 
and highlight recent studies exploring potential implications of human 
microbiota in the pathogenesis and the clinical course of sarcoidosis.
