Chromosomal NUP98-PHF23 translocation is associated with an aggressive form of 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and poor survival rate. Here, we report the 
molecular mechanisms by which NUP98-PHF23 recognizes the histone mark H3K4me3 
and is inhibited by small molecule compounds, including disulfiram that directly 
targets the PHD finger of PHF23 (PHF23PHD). Our data support a critical role for 
the PHD fingers of NUP98-PHF23, and related NUP98-KDM5A and NUP98-BPTF fusions 
in driving leukemogenesis, and demonstrate that blocking this interaction in 
NUP98-PHF23 expressing AML cells leads to cell death through necrotic and late 
apoptosis pathways. An overlap of NUP98-KDM5A oncoprotein binding sites and 
H3K4me3-positive loci at the Hoxa/b gene clusters and Meis1 in ChIP-seq, 
together with NMR analysis of the H3K4me3-binding sites of the PHD fingers from 
PHF23, KDM5A and BPTF, suggests a common PHD finger-dependent mechanism that 
promotes leukemogenesis by this type of NUP98 fusions. Our findings highlight 
the direct correlation between the abilities of NUP98-PHD finger fusion chimeras 
to associate with H3K4me3-enriched chromatin and leukemic transformation.
