WAVES is a large, single-center dataset comprising 9 years of high-frequency 
physiological waveform data from patients in intensive and acute care units at a 
large academic, pediatric medical center. The data comprise approximately 10.6 
million hours of 1 to 20 concurrent waveforms over approximately 50,364 distinct 
patient encounters. The data have been de-identified, cleaned, and organized to 
facilitate research. Initial analyses demonstrate the potential of the data for 
clinical applications such as non-invasive blood pressure monitoring and 
methodological applications such as waveform-agnostic data imputation. WAVES is 
the largest pediatric-focused and second largest physiological waveform dataset 
available for research.
