INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a complex multifactorial disease 
in which both genetic and environmental factors influence the onset, development 
and progression of disease. The genetic variations in the vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) can influence levels of VEGF protein expression, and thus, 
susceptibility to progression of kidney diseases. The aim of the present study 
was to evaluate the association of VEGF-2549 I/D and VEGF +936 C/T polymorphisms 
in CKD stage V patients from North-West India.
METHODS: In this case-control study, 166 patients and 166 controls were 
analyzed. DNA samples were screened for VEGF -2549I/D and VEGF +936 C/T 
polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction-based (PCR) methods.
RESULTS: The genotype frequency of VEGF -2549 I/D was significantly different 
between patients and controls (P < 0.05). ID genotype of VEGF -2549 I/D 
polymorphism was significantly associated with decreased risk of CKD (P = 
0.009). Genetic model analysis of VEGF -2549 I/D polymorphism revealed a 
significantly decreased risk of CKD in co-dominant (P = 0.009), dominant (P = 
0.021), and over-dominant (P = 0.012) models. Genotype and allele frequency of 
VEGF +936 C/T polymorphism was not significantly different between the patient 
and control groups. Genotype combination analysis revealed that ID-CT genotype 
combination of VEGF -2549 I/D and VEGF +936 C/T polymorphisms was associated 
with decreased CKD risk (P = 0.047).
CONCLUSION: VEGF -2549 ID genotype and ID-CT genotype combination of VEGF -2549 
I/D and VEGF +936 C/T polymorphisms was significantly associated with reduced 
CKD risk in North-West Indians.
