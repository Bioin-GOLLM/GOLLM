BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common 
primary cancer originating from thyroid follicular cells. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the positive predictors of micrometastasis in central lymph 
nodes in patients with papillary thyroid cancer.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. The study population was all known 
PTC patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection of the 
central neck nodes based on the current indications. Confirmation of central 
lymph node involvement was performed by permanent smear after surgery. Data were 
analyzed using SPSS software version 22. A P-value below 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: There was no significant relationship between age, gender, family 
history of PTC, family history of thyroid disease, multinodularity, history of 
other thyroid diseases, involvement of two thyroid lobes, and tumor grade with 
central lymph node involvement (P>0.05). There was a significant relationship 
between the tumor pathology and size with central lymph node involvement 
(P<0.05). Moreover, logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that female 
gender, multinodularity, and tumor size had a significant relationship with the 
incidence of central lymph node involvement (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Female gender, multinodularity, and larger tumor size may be 
predictors of micrometastasis in central lymph nodes in patients with papillary 
thyroid cancer.
