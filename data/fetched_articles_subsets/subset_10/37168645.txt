Juvenile hemochromatosis is a rare inherited disorder of iron regulation leading 
to iron overload, which usually presents before the age of 30. One of the most 
serious clinical characteristics associated with early-onset iron overload is 
liver disease with eventual cirrhosis, often associated with a reduced life 
expectancy even after treatment. This case report summarizes an asymptomatic 
pediatric patient with persistently elevated transaminase levels, which led to a 
diagnosis of juvenile hemochromatosis relatively early in the course of his 
disease. The aim of this case report is to increase awareness and stress the 
importance of early diagnosis and treatment, as it is vital to prevent 
life-threatening complications and optimize patient outcomes. Consideration 
should be taken to recognize potential manifestations despite the rarity of the 
condition. Patients with signs of hepatocellular injury without explanation 
should prompt evaluation including consideration for iron overload after other 
common causes are ruled out.
