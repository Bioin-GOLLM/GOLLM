Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals 
may have unique characteristics that alter susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. 
However, identifying truly exposed HESN is challenging. We utilized stored data 
and biospecimens from HIV-1 serodifferent couple cohorts, in which couples' 
HIV-1 exposures were quantified based on unprotected sex frequency and viral 
load of the partner with HIV-1. We compared peripheral blood gene expression 
between 15 HESN and 18 seroconverters prior to infection. We found PTPRC 
(encoding CD45 antigen) and interferon-response pathways had significantly 
higher expression among individuals who went on to become seropositive and thus 
may be a signature for increased acquisition risk.
