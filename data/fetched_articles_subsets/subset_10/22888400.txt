To better understand the recognition mechanism of RISC and the repertoire of 
guide-target interactions we introduced G:U wobbles and mismatches at various 
positions of the microRNA (miRNA) 'seed' region and performed all-atom molecular 
dynamics simulations of the resulting Ago-miRNA:mRNA ternary complexes. Our 
simulations reveal that many modifications, including combinations of multiple 
G:U wobbles and mismatches in the seed region, are admissible and result in only 
minor structural fluctuations that do not affect overall complex stability. 
These results are further supported by analyses of HITS-CLIP data. Lastly, 
introduction of disruptive mutations revealed a bending motion of the PAZ domain 
along the L1/L2 'hinge' and a subsequent opening of the nucleic-acid-binding 
channel. Our findings suggest that the spectrum of a miRNA's admissible targets 
is different from what is currently anticipated by the canonical seed-model. 
Moreover, they provide a likely explanation for the previously reported 
sequence-dependent regulation of unintended targeting by siRNAs.
