Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global 
pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since December 2019 that has led 
to more than 160 million confirmed cases, including 3.3 million deaths. To 
understand the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 invades human cells and reveal 
organ-specific susceptible cell types for COVID-19, we conducted comprehensive 
bioinformatic analysis using public single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. 
Utilizing the expression information of six confirmed COVID-19 receptors (ACE2, 
TMPRSS2, NRP1, AXL, FURIN and CTSL), we demonstrated that macrophages are the 
most likely cells that may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in lung. 
Besides the widely reported 'chemokine storm', we identified ribosome related 
pathways that may also be potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 lung 
infection patients. Moreover, cell-cell communication analysis and trajectory 
analysis revealed that M1-like macrophages showed the highest relation to severe 
COVID-19 patients. And we also demonstrated that up-regulation of chemokine 
pathways generally lead to severe symptoms, while down-regulation of ribosome 
and RNA activity related pathways are more likely to be mild. Other 
organ-specific susceptible cell type analyses could also provide potential 
targets for COVID-19 therapy. This work can provide clues for understanding the 
pathogenesis of COVID-19 and contribute to understanding the mechanism by which 
SARS-CoV-2 invades human cells.
