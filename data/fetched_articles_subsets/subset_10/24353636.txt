OBJECTIVE: We conducted a case-control study by genotyping three potential 
functional SNPs to assess the association of Xeroderma pigmentosum 
complementation group F (XPF) polymorphisms with gastric cancer susceptibility, 
and role of XPF polymorphisms in combination with H.pylori infection in the risk 
of gastric cancer.
METHODOLOGY: A hospital case-control study was conducted. A total of 331 
patients with gastric cancer and 355 controls were collected. Three SNPs of XPF, 
XPF rs180067, rs1799801 and rs2276466, were genotyped by Taqman real-time PCR 
method with a 7900 HT sequence detector system.
RESULTS: The gastric cancer patients were more likely to have smoking habit, a 
family history of cancer and H.pylori infection. We did not find the significant 
difference in the genotype distributions of XPF rs180067, rs1799801 and 
rs2276466 between cases and controls. Multivariate logistic analysis showed a 
non-significant decreased risk in patients carrying rs180067 G allele, rs1799801 
T allele or rs2276466 T allele genotypes. The stratification by H.pylori 
infection was not significantly different in polymorphisms of XPF rs180067, 
rs1799801 and rs2276466.
CONCLUSION: There was no evidence that polymorphisms in rs180067, rs1799801 and 
rs2276466 significantly affect the risk of gastric cancer. Further large sample 
size studies are strongly needed to validate their association.
