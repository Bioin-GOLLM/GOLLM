BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) with variable clinical 
presentations and heterogeneity is the common cause of sudden cardiac death. 
Genetic diagnosis is challenging in these complex diseases but exome sequencing 
as a genetic diagnostic tool provides explainable results.
METHODS: In a familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy with multigenerational 
inheritance with apparent phenotype, had a history of sudden death and severe 
arrhythmia followed by implantation of Implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
(ICD). Exome sequencing (100×) trailed by effective filtering steps for exome 
variants on the basis of different parameters, segregated variants are 
prioritized for the disease and further clinical relevance are evaluated for the 
variants.
RESULTS: A rare causal variant in troponin-T gene (TNNT2, 
NM_000364.3;c.274C > T;p.Arg92Trp) is identified, shared by only affected 
members, absent in unaffected members and also in 200 unrelated control 
chromosomes. TNNT2 mutation act as a driver mutation but mutations in other 
disease-related genes, KCNMB1, LPL, APOE and other biochemical factors provides 
risk stratification within affected family members.
CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the role of "rare variants" in complex 
disease phenotypes and heterogeneity within family and the necessity of whole 
exome targeted approaches in complex cardiomyopathy, which are known to harbor 
private mutations.
