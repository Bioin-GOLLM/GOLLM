Triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) conjugated compounds selectively target cancer cells 
by exploiting their hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential. To date, 
studies have focused on modifying either the linker or the cargo of 
TPP+-conjugated compounds. Here, we investigated the biological effects 
of direct modification to TPP+ to improve the efficacy and detection of 
mito-metformin (MMe), a TPP+-conjugated probe we have shown to have promising 
preclinical efficacy against solid cancer cells. We designed, synthesized, and 
tested trifluoromethyl and methoxy MMe analogs (pCF3-MMe, mCF3-MMe, and 
pMeO-MMe) against multiple distinct human cancer cells. pCF3-MMe showed enhanced 
selectivity toward cancer cells compared to MMe, while retaining the same 
signaling mechanism. Importantly, pCF3-MMe allowed quantitative monitoring of 
cellular accumulation via 19F-NMR in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, adding 
trifluoromethyl groups to TPP+ reduced toxicity in vivo while retaining 
anti-tumor efficacy, opening an avenue to de-risk these next-generation 
TPP+-conjugated compounds.
