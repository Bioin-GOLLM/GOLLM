To compare the effects of two nap opportunities (20 and 90 min) to 
countermeasure the transient naturally occurring increased sleepiness and 
decreased performances during the post-lunch dip (PLD). Fourteen highly trained 
judokas completed in a counterbalanced and randomized order three test sessions 
(control (No-nap), 20- (N20) and 90-min (N90) nap opportunities). Test sessions 
consisted of the running-based anaerobic sprint test (RAST), simple and 
multiple-choice reaction times (MCRT) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). 
From the RAST, the maximum (Pmax), mean (Pmean) and minimum (Pmin) powers were 
calculated. Blood samples were taken before and after the RAST to measure the 
effect of pre-exercise napping on energetic and muscle damage biomarkers and 
antioxidant defense. N20 increased Pmax and Pmean compared to No-nap (p < 0.001, 
d = 0.59; d = 0.66) and N90 (p < 0.001, d = 0.98; d = 0.72), respectively. 
Besides, plasma lactate and creatinine increased only when the exercise was 
performed after N20. Both N20 (p < 0.001, d = 1.18) and N90 (p < 0.01, d = 0.78) 
enhanced post-exercise superoxide dismutase activity compared to No-nap. 
However, only N20 enhanced post-exercise glutathione peroxidase activity (p < 
0.001, d = 1.01) compared to pre-nap. Further, MCRT performance was higher after 
N20 compared to No-nap and N90 (p < 0.001, d = 1.15; d = 0.81, respectively). 
Subjective sleepiness was lower after N20 compared to No-nap (p < 0.05, d = 
0.92) and N90 (p < 0.01, d = 0.89). The opportunity to nap for 20 min in the PLD 
enhanced RAST, MCRT performances, and antioxidant defense, and decreased 
sleepiness. However, the opportunity of 90 min nap was associated with decreased 
repeated sprint performances and increased sleepiness, probably because of the 
sleep inertia.
