Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) gene variants are involved in different 
neuropsychiatric disorders and cognitive impairments, associated with altered 
dopamine function. This study investigated the genotypic and haplotypic 
association of COMT rs4680 and rs4618 polymorphisms with the severity of 
cognitive and other clinical symptoms in 544 male and 385 female subjects with 
schizophrenia. COMT rs4818 G carriers were more frequent in male patients with 
mild abstract thinking difficulties, compared to CC homozygotes or C allele 
carriers. Male carriers of COMT rs4680 A allele had worse abstract thinking (N5) 
scores than GG carriers, whereas AA homozygotes were more frequent in male 
subjects with lower scores on the intensity of the somatic concern (G1) item, 
compared to G carriers. Male carriers of COMT rs4818-rs4680 GA haplotype had the 
highest scores on the G1 item (somatic concern), whereas GG haplotype carriers 
had the lowest scores on G2 (anxiety) and G6 (depression) items. COMT GG 
haplotype was less frequent in female patients with severe disturbance of 
volition (G13 item) compared to the group with mild symptoms, while CG haplotype 
was more frequent in female patients with severe then mild symptoms. These 
findings suggest the sex-specific genotypic and haplotypic association of COMT 
variants with a severity of cognitive and other clinical symptoms of 
schizophrenia.
