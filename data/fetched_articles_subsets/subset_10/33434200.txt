OBJECTIVES: To describe and analyse studies aiming at quantitatively assessing 
the impact of interventions on patient-reported burden of treatment as an 
outcome (primary or secondary).
METHODS: The aim of the search strategy was to identify all publications 
describing a medical intervention intended to reduce patient-reported burden of 
treatment in adult patients with long-term conditions, from January 1, 2008 to 
July 15, 2019. Four databases (Medline, PsycINFO, the "Trials" section of the 
Cochrane-Library, and OpenGrey) were searched in English, French, Spanish, 
Italian and Portuguese. Each identified article was reviewed and the risk of 
bias was assessed using a tool adapted from the Cochrane Collaboration 
recommendations.
RESULTS: Of 641 articles retrieved, 11 were included in this review. There were 
nine randomized controlled trials, one non-randomized controlled trial, and one 
before-and-after study. The sample sizes ranged from 55 to 1,546 patients. Eight 
out of the eleven studies reported significant positive outcomes of the studied 
interventions. Reducing dosing frequency, improving background therapy, offering 
home care or providing easier-to-use medical devices were associated with 
positive outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Only a few studies have specifically focused on decreasing the 
subjective burden of treatment. Small trials conducted in patients with a single 
specific disorder have reported positive outcomes. However, a large, 
high-quality study assessing the impact of a change in care process in patients 
with multiple morbidities did not show such results. Further studies are needed 
to implement this aspect of patient-centred care.
