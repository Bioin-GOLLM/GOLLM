Assembly of the long helical filament of the bacterial flagellum requires 
polymerisation of ca 20,000 flagellin (FliC) monomeric subunits into the growing 
structure extending from the cell surface. Here, we show that export of 
Salmonella flagellin is facilitated specifically by a cytosolic protein, FliS, 
and that FliS binds to the FliC C-terminal helical domain, which contributes to 
stabilisation of flagellin subunit interactions during polymerisation. Stable 
complexes of FliS with flagellin were assembled efficiently in vitro, apparently 
by FliS homodimers binding to FliC monomers. The data suggest that FliS acts as 
a substrate-specific chaperone, preventing premature interaction of newly 
synthesised flagellin subunits in the cytosol. Compatible with this view, FliS 
was able to prevent in vitro polymerisation of FliC into filaments.
