STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Studies on the efficacy of erbium laser for 
enhancement of enamel resistance to acid attacks and its effects on fluoride 
uptake by the enamel are limited.
PURPOSE: This study sought to assess and compare the effects of erbium-doped 
yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) laser irradiation and application of acidulated 
phosphate fluoride (APF) gel (alone and in combination) on remineralization of 
artificial white spot lesions (WSLs).
MATERIALS AND METHOD: This in vitro, experimental study evaluated 90 buccal and 
lingual slabs of extracted human premolars. The specimens underwent pH cycling 
to induce WSLs. They were then randomly divided into 6 groups of caries-free 
positive control (c+), negative control with WSLs (ws), 1.23% APF gel applied on 
the enamel (F), Er:YAG laser irradiation (80 mJ, 10 Hz, and 8 J/cm2) of enamel 
(L), APF gel application followed by laser irradiation (FL), and laser 
irradiation followed by fluoride gel application (LF). The fluoride ion content 
of specimens was measured before and after the intervention using a 
potentiometer. Data were analyzed by ANOVA (p< 0.05).
RESULTS: APF gel application before/after laser irradiation maximally increased 
the fluoride uptake by the enamel (p= 0.000). Application of APF gel in group F 
and laser irradiation in group L increased fluoride uptake by the enamel, 
compared with groups 1 and 2 (p= 0.000). Laser- treated (L) and APF-treated (F) 
groups had no significant difference in this respect (p= 0.945). Maximum 
fluoride concentration was noted in combined laser and fluoride groups 
(FL=332.07ppm and LF=341.27ppm) with no significant difference between the two 
(p= 1.000).
CONCLUSION: Er:YAG laser irradiation changes the chemical composition of enamel 
and probably promote its remineralization, especially when combined with APF gel 
application, which highlights its cariostatic potential.
