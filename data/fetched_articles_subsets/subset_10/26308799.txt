Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer whose pathogenesis is causally 
linked to occupational exposure to asbestos. Familial clusters of mesotheliomas 
have been observed in settings of genetic predisposition. Mesothelioma incidence 
is anticipated to increase worldwide in the next two decades. Novel treatments 
are needed, as current treatment modalities may improve the quality of life, but 
have shown modest effects in improving overall survival. Increasing knowledge on 
the molecular characteristics of mesothelioma has led to the development of 
novel potential therapeutic strategies, including: molecular targeted 
approaches, that is the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor with 
bevacizumab; immunotherapy with chimeric monoclonal antibody, immunotoxin, 
antibody drug conjugate, vaccine and viruses; inhibition of asbestos-induced 
inflammation, that is aspirin inhibition of HMGB1 activity may decrease or delay 
mesothelioma onset and/or growth. We elaborate on the rationale behind new 
therapeutic strategies, and summarize available preclinical and clinical 
results, as well as efforts still ongoing.
