BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of autosomal dominantly 
inherited degenerative diseases. As the pathological process probably commences 
years before the first appearance of clinical symptoms, preclinical carriers of 
a SCA mutation offer the opportunity to study the earliest stages of cerebellar 
dysfunction and degeneration. Eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC) is a motor 
learning paradigm, crucially dependent on the integrity of the olivocerebellar 
circuit, and has been shown to be able to detect subtle alterations of 
cerebellar function, which might already be present in preclinical carriers.
METHODS: In order to acquire conditioned responses, we performed EBCC, delay 
paradigm, in 18 preclinical carriers of a SCA3 mutation and 16 healthy, 
age-matched controls by presenting repeated pairings of an auditory tone with a 
supraorbital nerve stimulus with a delay interval of 400Â ms.
RESULTS: Preclinical carriers acquired significantly less conditioned eyeblink 
responses than controls and learning rates were significantly reduced. This 
motor learning defect was, however, not associated with the predicted time to 
onset.
CONCLUSIONS: EBCC is impaired in preclinical carriers of a SCA3 mutation, as a 
result of impaired motor learning capacities of the cerebellum and is thus 
suggestive of cerebellar dysfunction. EBCC can be used to detect but probably 
not monitor preclinical cerebellar dysfunction in genetic ataxias, such as SCA3.
