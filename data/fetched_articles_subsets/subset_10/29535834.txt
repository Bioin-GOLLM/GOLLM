The identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers from early lesions, 
measurable in liquid biopsies remains a major challenge, particularly in 
oncology. Fresh human material of high quality is required for biomarker 
discovery but is often not available when it is totally required for clinical 
pathology investigation. Hence, all OMICs studies are done on residual and less 
clinically relevant biological samples. Here after, we present an innovative, 
simple, and non-destructive, procedure named EXPEL that uses rapid, 
pressure-assisted, interstitial fluid extrusion, preserving the specimen for 
full routine clinical pathology investigation. In the meantime, the technique 
allows a comprehensive OMICs analysis (proteins, metabolites, miRNAs and DNA). 
As proof of concept, we have applied EXPEL on freshly collected human colorectal 
cancer and liver metastases tissues. We demonstrate that the procedure 
efficiently allows the extraction, within a few minutes, of a wide variety of 
biomolecules holding diagnostic and prognostic potential while keeping both 
tissue morphology and antigenicity unaltered. Our method enables, for the first 
time, both clinicians and scientists to explore identical clinical material 
regardless of its origin and size, which has a major positive impact on 
translation to the clinic.
