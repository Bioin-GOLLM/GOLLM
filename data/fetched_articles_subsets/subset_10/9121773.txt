Recently, constitutively active mutants of MEK (MAP/ERK kinase) were shown to be 
capable of transforming cells to tumorigenicity suggesting that MEK can function 
as a dominant oncogene and potentially play a role in human carcinogenesis. 
Human lung cancer cells exhibit mutations in other components of the MAP kinase 
signaling pathway such as the Her-2/neu and ras oncogenes. Thus, the coding 
sequences of both MEK-1 and MEK-2 cDNAs from human lung cancer cell lines were 
screened by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing 
for alterations in these two genes. In 37 lung cancer cell lines we found: an 
allelic variant in MEK-1 cDNA, nt 783 G-->A, (no amino acid change); a MEK-2 
cDNA change (nt 977 C-->T mutation leading to 298 Pro-->Leu change); a MEK-2 
cDNA change nt 537 C-->T (no amino acid change); and a frequent MEK-2 cDNA 
germline polymorphism nt 744, A-->C (no amino acid change) with an allele 
frequency of 0.5 for each form. These results suggest that mutations in the 
MEK-1 and MEK-2 gene occur at a very low frequency in human lung cancer.
