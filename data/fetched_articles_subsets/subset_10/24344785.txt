The association between angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T gene polymorphism and IgA 
nephropathy (IgAN) risk remains elusive. Our aim was to evaluate the association 
between AGT M235T gene polymorphism and IgAN susceptibility by performing a 
meta-analysis. Eligible studies were searched according to predefined criteria 
using electronic databases. Eight studies were identified for the analysis of 
the association between AGT M235T gene polymorphism and IgAN risk. M allele/MM 
genotype were not associated with IgAN risk in overall populations, Caucasians 
and Asians (overall populations: p = 0.448 and 0.861, Caucasians: p = 0.618 and 
0.886, Asians: p = 0.566 and 0.652). TT/MT genotype were not associated with 
IgAN risk in overall populations, Caucasians and Asians (overall populations: 
p = 0.703 and 0.454, Caucasians: p = 0.975 and 0.946, Asians: p = 0.697 and 
0.353). No evidence of publication bias was observed. In conclusion, AGT M235T 
gene polymorphism may not be correlated with IgAN susceptibility in overall 
populations, Caucasians and Asians. However, more studies should be performed in 
the future.
