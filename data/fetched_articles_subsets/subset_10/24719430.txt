Neutralizing antibodies that target the hemagglutinin of influenza virus either 
inhibit binding of hemagglutinin to cellular receptors or prevent the 
low-pH-induced conformational change in hemagglutinin required for membrane 
fusion. In general, the former type of antibody binds to the globular head 
formed by HA1 and has narrow strain specificity, while the latter type binds to 
the stem mainly formed by HA2 and has broad strain specificity. In the present 
study, we analyzed the epitope and function of a broadly neutralizing human 
antibody against H3N2 viruses, F005-126. The crystal structure of F005-126 Fab 
in complex with hemagglutinin revealed that the antibody binds to the globular 
head, spans a cleft formed by two hemagglutinin monomers in a hemagglutinin 
trimer, and cross-links them. It recognizes two peptide portions (sites L and R) 
and a glycan linked to asparagine at residue 285 using three 
complementarity-determining regions and framework 3 in the heavy chain. Binding 
of the antibody to sites L (residues 171 to 173, 239, and 240) and R (residues 
91, 92, 270 to 273, 284, and 285) is mediated mainly by van der Waals contacts 
with the main chains of the peptides in these sites and secondarily by hydrogen 
bonds with a few side chains of conserved sequences in HA1. Furthermore, the 
glycan recognized by F005-126 is conserved among H3N2 viruses. F005-126 has the 
ability to prevent low-pH-induced conformational changes in hemagglutinin. The 
newly identified conserved epitope, including the glycan, should be immunogenic 
in humans and may induce production of broadly neutralizing antibodies against 
H3 viruses.
IMPORTANCE: Antibodies play an important role in protection against influenza 
virus, and hemagglutinin is the major target for virus neutralizing antibodies. 
It has long been believed that all effective neutralizing antibodies bind to the 
surrounding regions of the sialic acid-binding pocket and inhibit the binding of 
hemagglutinin to the cellular receptor. Since mutations are readily introduced 
into such epitopes, this type of antibody shows narrow strain specificity. 
Recently, however, broadly neutralizing antibodies have been isolated. Most of 
these bind either to conserved sites in the stem region or to the sialic 
acid-binding pocket itself. In the present study, we identified a new 
neutralizing epitope in the head region recognized by a broadly neutralizing 
human antibody against H3N2. This epitope may be useful for design of vaccines.
