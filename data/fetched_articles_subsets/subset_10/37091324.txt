Ophiocordyceps xuefengensis is an ethnopharmacological fungus with broad 
pharmacological properties. Light is a critical environmental factor for the 
stromata formation and development of many fungi. In this study, 
photomorphogenesis and blue light receptor genes were studied using a strain of 
O. xuefengensis. Light represses vegetative growth, but conidia linked to 
stromata can be observed under both light and dark conditions. Light and dark 
conditions had little effect on the accumulation of polysaccharides and 
adenosine. The genes Oxwc-1 and Oxwc-2 encoding photoreceptors of O. 
xuefengensis were cloned and predicted to possess polypeptides of 937 and 525 
amino acids, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis based on fungal WC-1/2 
supported OxWC-1 and OxWC-2 were photoreceptor. The expression of both the 
Oxwc-1 and Oxwc-2 genes reached a maximum after receiving light stimulation for 
15 min, which might relate to the inhibition of stromata growth.
