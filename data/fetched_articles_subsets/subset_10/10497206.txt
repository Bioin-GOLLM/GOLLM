The three-dimensional crystal structure of hen apo-ovotransferrin has been 
solved by molecular replacement and refined by simulated annealing and 
restrained least squares to a 3.0-A resolution. The final model, which comprises 
5312 protein atoms (residues 1 to 686) and 28 carbohydrate atoms (from two 
monosaccharides attached to Asn(473)), gives an R-factor of 0.231 for the 11,989 
observed reflections between 20.0- and 3.0-A resolution. In the structure, both 
empty iron binding clefts are in the open conformation, lending weight to the 
theory that Fe(3+) binding or release in transferrin proceeds via a mechanism 
that involves domain opening and closure. Upon opening, the domains rotate 
essentially as rigid bodies. The two domains of the N-lobe rotate away from one 
another by 53 degrees, whereas the C-lobe domains rotate away each another by 35 
degrees. These rotations take place about an axis that passes through the two 
beta-strands, linking the domains. The domains of each lobe make different 
contacts with one another in the open and closed forms. These contacts form two 
interdomain interfaces on either side of the rotation axis, and domain opening 
or closing produces a see-saw motion between these two alternative close-packed 
interfaces. The interdomain disulfide bridge (Cys(478)-Cys(671)), found only in 
the C-lobe, may restrict domain opening but does not completely prevent it.
