Chiral pool α-amino acids have been used as powerful tools for the total 
synthesis of structurally diverse natural products. Some common naturally 
occurring α-amino acids are readily available in both enantiomerically pure 
forms. The applications of the chiral pool in asymmetric synthesis can be 
categorized prudently as chiral sources, devices, and inducers. This review 
specifically examines recent advances in substrate-controlled asymmetric 
reactions induced by the chirality of α-amino acid templates in natural product 
synthesis research and related areas.
