Antifungal resistance in pathogenic fungi is a growing global health concern. 
Nonpathogenic laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are an important 
model for studying mechanisms of antifungal resistance that are relevant to 
understanding the same processes in pathogenic fungi. We have developed a series 
of laboratory modules in which high school students used experimental evolution 
to study antifungal resistance by isolating azole-resistant S. cerevisiae 
mutants and examining the genetic basis of resistance. We have sequenced 99 
clones from these experiments and found that all possessed mutations previously 
shown to impact azole resistance, validating our approach. We additionally found 
recurrent mutations in an mRNA degradation pathway and an uncharacterized 
mitochondrial protein (Csf1) that have possible mechanistic connections to azole 
resistance. The scale of replication in this initiative allowed us to identify 
candidate epistatic interactions, as evidenced by pairs of mutations that occur 
in the same clone more frequently than expected by chance (positive epistasis) 
or less frequently (negative epistasis). We validated one of these pairs, a 
negative epistatic interaction between gain-of-function mutations in the 
multidrug resistance transcription factors Pdr1 and Pdr3. This high 
school-university collaboration can serve as a model for involving members of 
the broader public in the scientific process to make meaningful discoveries in 
biomedical research.
