In tropical areas, there are a variety of parasitic and nonparasitic causes of 
high-grade splenomegaly. An adolescent male patient with haemoglobin 
E/β-thalassaemia came with high-grade splenomegaly and severe anaemia, requiring 
blood transfusions on a regular basis. Treatment with folic acid and antioxidant 
vitamins reduced the requirement for blood transfusions, brought haemoglobin 
levels back to near normal, and reduced splenic enlargement.  Haemoglobin 
E/β-thalassaemia is a haematological condition that causes anaemia and 
high-grade splenomegaly in the tropics. Initially, the disease was only seen in 
Southeast Asia, but it has since spread around the world due to migration from 
that region.
