BACKGROUND: In 1997, it was reported that a PTEN gene deletion, a common genetic 
mutation in Cowden's disease (CD), was identified in a patient with 
Bannayan-Riley-Ruvacalba (BRR), suggesting that the two diseases were allelic. 
However, the clinical overlap between the two diseases has largely remained 
unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To confirm the genetic and clinical association in a family 
segregating both CD and BRR.
METHODS: Clinical evaluation and genetic analysis using a denaturing gradient 
gel electrophoresis (DGGE), temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis 
(TTGE), and DNA sequencing techniques.
RESULTS: Our patient presents with typical BRR clinical manifestations, 
including multiple lentigines on his penis, while his mother presents with 
typical manifestations of CD, including multiple malignancies. Genetic analyses 
of leukocytes from the patient and his mother showed mutations in exon 8 that 
was identified as the presumably truncating mutation R335X.
CONCLUSION: This report provides clinical evidence that both BRR and CD are 
closely related and confirms the PTEN gene mutation in BRR and CD patients 
segregating in the same family, thus confirming the genetic linkage between the 
two genodermatoses.
