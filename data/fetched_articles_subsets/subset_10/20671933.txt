Negative phototaxis in Natronomonas pharaonis is initiated by transient 
interaction changes between photoreceptor and transducer. pharaonis 
phoborhodopsin (ppR; also called pharaonis sensory rhodopsin II, psR-II) and the 
cognate transducer protein, pHtrII, form a tight 2 : 2 complex in the 
unphotolyzed state, and the interaction is somehow altered during the photocycle 
of ppR. We have studied the signal transduction mechanism in the ppR/pHtrII 
system by means of low-temperature Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) 
spectroscopy. In the paper, spectral comparison in the absence and presence of 
pHtrII provided fruitful information in atomic details, where vibrational bands 
were identified by the use of isotope-labeling and site-directed mutagenesis. 
From these studies, we established the two pathways of light-signal conversion 
from the receptor to the transducer; (i) from Lys205 (retinal) of ppR to Asn74 
of pHtrII through Thr204 and Tyr199, and (ii) from Lys205 of ppR to the 
cytoplasmic loop region of pHtrII that links Gly83.
