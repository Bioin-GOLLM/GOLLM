AIM/HYPOTHESIS: This study aimed to investigate if variability in the peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) gene is associated 
with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: The PGC-1 gene was examined in 53 Type II diabetic patients applying 
single strand conformational polymorphism analysis followed by nucleotide 
sequencing. Identified variants were genotyped in an association study 
comprising 483 Type II diabetic patients and 216 glucose-tolerant control 
subjects. A replication study was done in an additional 201 Type II diabetic 
patients and 293 glucose-tolerant subjects. Furthermore, a potential interaction 
between the Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPAR-gamma2 and the PGC-1 Gly482Ser variant 
on risk of Type II diabetes was investigated.
RESULTS: A total of seven variants (Ser74Leu, IVS2 + 52C-->A, Thr394Thr, 
Asp475Asp, Gly482Ser, Thr528Thr, and Thr612Met) were identified and investigated 
in an association study. Six of the variants showed no association with Type II 
diabetes in the initial study. However, the Gly482Ser polymorphism, was more 
frequent among Type II diabetic patients (37.0 %) than among glucose-tolerant 
subjects (30.8 %) (p = 0.032). In a replication study the difference in allele 
frequencies of the Gly482Ser variant remained significant (p = 0.0135). The 
combined study yielded an allele frequency of 37.3 % (34.7-39.9) for Type II 
diabetic patients and 30.5 % (27.7-33.4) for glucose-tolerant subjects (p = 
0.0007). No interaction between this variant and the Pro12Ala polymorphism of 
PPAR-gamma2 was observed.
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: A widespread Gly482Ser polymorphism of PGC-1 is 
associated with a 1.34 genotype relative risk of Type II diabetes.
