Two new thio-compounds named aspergerthinol A and B (1 and 2) and two new 
monoterpenes named aspergerthinacids A and B (3 and 4) were isolated from the 
fungus Aspergillus sp. CYH26 from the rhizosphere soil of Cynanchum bungei 
Decne. The structures of compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic data and 
quantum NMR and ECD calculations. Compounds 1 and 2 represented a new family of 
sulfur containing natural products with a 
3-methyl-4H-cyclopenta[b]thiophen-4-one skeleton. Compounds 1-4 showed 
inhibitory activities against nitric oxide (NO) with IC50 values of 38.0, 19.8, 
46.3, and 56.6 μM, respectively.
