PURPOSE: The roles of T (brachyury) isoforms in chordomas remain unclear. This 
study aimed to investigate the different roles and mechanisms of them in 
chordomas.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of T isoforms mRNAs in 57 chordomas was 
assessed, and a prognosis analysis was conducted. Cell apoptosis, proliferation 
and cell cycle assays were performed after specific T isoform mRNA knockdown. 
Whole-transcriptome sequencing, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene Ontology 
analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis and competing 
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: As revealed in this study, the T-long isoform was a significant risk 
factor (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; P=0.018) and the T-short isoform was a 
protective factor (HR, 0.24; P=0.012) associated with tumor recurrence. After 
T-long isoform knockdown, the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase and cell 
proliferation was significantly inhibited. A bioinformatic analysis revealed 
that the upregulation of H19, P21 and GADD45B; downregulation of SKP2 and CDK2; 
and accompanying changes in the P53 signaling pathway consistently contributed 
to G0/G1 arrest. After T-short isoform knockdown, the cell cycle was arrested at 
G2/M phase and cell apoptosis tended to increase slightly (P=0.067). The 
upregulation of YWHAZ and downregulation of E2F1 and its target genes might 
contribute to cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and apoptosis. In addition, the 
ceRNA network, consisting of long noncoding RNAs, mRNAs and microRNAs, was 
established.
CONCLUSION: The T-long isoform was a risk factor and the T-short isoform was a 
protective factor for chordoma recurrence. In addition, the cell cycle was the 
main target of T isoforms knockdown, and the changes in the downstream 
transcriptome may contribute to the different effects of specific T isoform 
knockdown on the changes in the cell cycle distributions and apoptosis and 
proliferation of chordoma cells.
