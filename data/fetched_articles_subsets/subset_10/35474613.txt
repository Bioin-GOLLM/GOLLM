BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a complex physiological and pathological process. 
Although many types of inflammation are well characterized, their physiological 
functions are largely unknown. tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1 (TRDMT1) 
has been implicated as a stress-related protein, but its intrinsic biological 
role is unclear.
METHODS: We constructed a Trdmt1 knockout rat and adopted the LPS-induced sepsis 
model. Survival curve, histopathological examination, expression of inflammatory 
factors, and protein level of TLR4 pathway were analyzed.
RESULTS: Trdmt1 deletion had no obvious impact on development and growth. Trdmt1 
deletion slightly increased the mortality during aging. Our data showed that 
Trdmt1 strongly responded in LPS-treated rats, and Trdmt1 knockout rats were 
vulnerable to LPS treatment with declined survival rate. We also observed more 
aggravated tissue damage and more cumulative functional cell degeneration in 
LPS-treated knockout rats compared with control rats. Further studies showed 
upregulated TNF-α level in liver, spleen, lung, and serum tissues, which may be 
explained by enhanced p65 and p38 phosphorylation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that Trdmt1 plays a protective role in 
inflammation by regulating the TLR4-NF-κB/MAPK-TNF-α pathway. This work provides 
useful information to understand the TRDMT1 function in inflammation.
