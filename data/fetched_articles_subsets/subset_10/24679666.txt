NOD2/CARD15 and IL23R gene variants play an important role in the susceptibility 
to Crohn's disease (CD). Studies of genotype-phenotype relationship suggest that 
these variants are associated with the development of the disease and specific 
phenotype. Preliminary reports analyzing the association between these variants 
have never been made on Algerian CD's. In a case-control design, 204 Algerian 
with CD diagnosed for at least 5years and 201 controls were included were 
genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the NOD2/CARD15 gene 
R702W (SNP8, rs2066844), G908R (SNP12, rs2066845) and IL23R R381Q (rs11209026) 
gene variants were determined using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. 
NOD2/CARD15 908R was carried by 3% of the patients and none in control subjects 
(χ(2)=8.6, Pc=0.003, OR=13.20). NOD2/CARD15 702W was associated to CD outcome 
(χ(2)=17.2, Pc=0.00003, OR=12.5) and early onset of disease (group A1, 
χ(2)=19.3, Pc=1.10(-5), OR=14.05, PM-H=2.10(-6)). IL23R 381Q variants was more 
frequent in CD's patients than controls (χ(2)=8, Pc=0.005, OR=3.48), it was 
associated to earlier onset (group A1, χ(2)=7.1, Pc=0.007, OR=1.04, PM-H=0.002), 
extra-intestinal manifestations (EIM) outcome (χ(2)=10.6, Pc=0.001, OR=1.05, 
PM-H=0.002) and ileocolonic location (χ(2)=6.8, Pc=0.009, OR=1.05, PM-H=0.001). 
In this Algerian cohort, NOD2/CARD15 and IL23R variants were associated with 
CD's outcomes and linked to a particular clinical phenotype.
