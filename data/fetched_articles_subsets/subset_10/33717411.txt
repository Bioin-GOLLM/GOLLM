Accurate chromosome segregation is required for cell survival and organismal 
development. During mitosis, the spindle assembly checkpoint acts as a safeguard 
to maintain the high fidelity of mitotic chromosome segregation by monitoring 
the attachment of kinetochores to the mitotic spindle. Bub1 is a conserved 
kinase critical for the spindle assembly checkpoint. Bub1 also facilitates 
chromosome alignment and contributes to the regulation of mitotic duration. 
Here, focusing on the spindle assembly checkpoint and on chromosome alignment, 
we summarize the primary literature on Bub1, discussing its structure and 
functional domains, as well its regulation and roles in mitosis. In addition, we 
discuss recent evidence for roles of Bub1 beyond mitosis regulation in TGFβ 
signaling and telomere replication. Finally, we discuss the involvement of Bub1 
in human diseases, especially in cancer, and the potential of using Bub1 as a 
drug target for therapeutic applications.
