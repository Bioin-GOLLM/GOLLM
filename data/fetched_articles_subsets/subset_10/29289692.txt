Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) has reached pandemic proportions and effective 
prevention strategies are wanted. Its onset is accompanied by cellular distress, 
the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor 
boosting cytoprotective responses, and many phytochemicals activate Nrf2 
signaling. Thus, Nrf2 activation by natural products could presumably alleviate 
DM. We summarize function, regulation and exogenous activation of Nrf2, as well 
as diabetes-linked and Nrf2-susceptible forms of cellular stress. The reported 
amelioration of insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction and diabetic 
complications by activated Nrf2 as well as the status quo of Nrf2 in precision 
medicine for DM are reviewed.
