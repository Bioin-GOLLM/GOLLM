Purification and some properties of L-glutamate decarboxylase from human brain.

Blindermann JM, Maitre M, Ossola L, Mandel P.

Glutamate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15) from human brain has been purified 
8000-fold with respect to the initial homogenate. The molecular weight of the 
native enzyme was found to be 140000 by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide 
gradient gel slab. The presence of a single protein band (Mr 67000) on sodium 
dodecylsulphate/polyacrylamide gel and the existence of only one N-terminal 
amino acid suggest that the enzyme consists of two similar if not identical 
polypeptide chains. The Km of the enzyme at the optimum pH of 6.8 is about 1.3 x 
10(-3) M for glutamate and 0.13 x 10(-6) M for pyridoxal phosphate. The analysis 
of the effects of various inhibitors of mouse brain glutamate decarboxylase on 
the human enzyme confirms the strong competitive inhibition caused by 
3-mercaptopropionic acid (Ki = 2.7 x 10(-6) M) while the Ki values for 
allylglycine and chloride ion are 1.8 x 10(-2) M and 2.2 x 10(-2) M, 
respectively.
