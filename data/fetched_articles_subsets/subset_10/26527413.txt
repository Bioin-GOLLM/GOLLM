BACKGROUND: Canagliflozin, an oral agent that inhibits sodium glucose 
co-transporter 2, improves glycemic control, body weight, and blood pressure and 
is generally well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
This study extends the scope of previous analyses by evaluating outcomes 
associated with the use of canagliflozin over a 6-month period in a real-world 
setting.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data obtained from a large health 
plan database for patients (≥18 years) with a diagnosis of T2DM who filled at 
least one canagliflozin prescription between April 1, 2013 and October 30, 2013 
(first 7 months canagliflozin was commercially available in the USA) and were 
continuously enrolled in the health plan for 6 months prior to (baseline) and 
6 months following the first canagliflozin prescription claim (follow-up). 
Changes in glycemic control were evaluated, along with characteristics of 
enrolled patients and changes in treatment patterns.
RESULTS: 4017 patients (mean age 56 years, 43 % female) met the study inclusion 
criteria. Of these, at the time of first canagliflozin claim, 21 % used 
canagliflozin concomitantly with three or more other antihyperglycemic agents 
(AHAs), 29 % with two other AHAs, 30 % with one other AHA, and 20 % without 
other AHAs. During follow-up, patients received 3.4 (average) canagliflozin 
prescription fills and a mean of 148 total days of supply; median adherence 
(interquartile range [IQR]) was 86 % (66-98 %) for patients with ≥2 fills. Among 
patients with available glycated hemoglobin (A1C) measurements at baseline and 
follow-up (n = 826, baseline A1C 8.59 %), mean A1C reduction was 0.81 % 
(P < 0.001). Mean A1C reduction during the follow-up period was greatest in 
patients with the highest baseline A1C levels. Of the patients who used 
canagliflozin concomitantly with other AHAs, 20 % were observed to discontinue 
one or more other AHAs during follow-up. The most commonly discontinued baseline 
AHAs were: glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (16 %), dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitors (15 %), insulin (13 %), sulfonylureas (13 %), and 
metformin (11 %).
CONCLUSIONS: This real-world study on canagliflozin use in a range of patients 
with T2DM demonstrated significant improvements in mean A1C from baseline 
following the first canagliflozin prescription. In patients concomitantly using 
one or more additional AHAs at baseline, there appears to be a trend toward 
lower other AHA use after canagliflozin initiation.
