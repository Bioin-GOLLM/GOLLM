The title copper(II) complex of a pyridine-containing macrocycle (PyMAC), 
[Cu(C16H28N4)](ClO4)2, has been prepared. The crystal structure reveals the 
Cu(II) atom to be octahedrally coordinated by a tetradentate aminopyridine 
macrocyclic ligand surrounding the metal cation in a square-planar geometry. Two 
weakly bound perchlorate counter-ions occupy the axial sites above and below the 
macrocyclic plane. The crystal studied was refined as a two-component 
pseudo-merohedral twin; the refined fractional contribution of the minor 
component is 38.77 (8).
