CYP119, a cytochrome P450 from a thermophilic organism for which a crystal 
structure is available, is shown here to hydroxylate lauric acid in a reaction 
supported by putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase. This fatty acid 
hydroxylation activity is increased 15-fold by T214V and D77R mutations. The 
T214V mutation increases the rate by facilitating substrate binding and 
enhancing the associated spin state change, whereas the D77R mutation improves 
binding of the heterologous redox partner putidaredoxin to CYP119 and the rate 
of electron transfer from it to the heme group. A sequence alignment with 
P450(cam) can, therefore, be used to identify a part of the binding site for 
putidaredoxin on an unrelated P450 enzyme. This information can be used to 
engineer by mutagenesis an improved complementarity of the protein-protein 
interface that results in improved electron transfer from putidaredoxin to the 
P450 enzyme. As a result, the catalytic activity of the thermo- and barostable 
CYP119 has been incorporated into a catalytic system that hydroxylates fatty 
acids.
