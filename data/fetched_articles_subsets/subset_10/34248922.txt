In addition to humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) can transmit to animals that include hamsters, cats, dogs, mink, 
ferrets, tigers, lions, cynomolgus macaques, rhesus macaques, and treeshrew. 
Among these, mink are particularly susceptible. Indeed, 10 countries in Europe 
and North America reported SARS-CoV-2 infection among mink on fur farms. In 
Denmark, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly among mink farms and spilled-over back into 
humans, acquiring mutations/deletions with unknown consequences for virulence 
and antigenicity. Here we describe a mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 variant (Cluster 
5) characterized by 11 amino acid substitutions and four amino acid deletions 
relative to Wuhan-Hu-1. Temporal virus titration, together with genomic and 
subgenomic viral RNA quantitation, demonstrated a modest in vitro fitness 
attenuation of the Cluster 5 virus in the Vero-E6 cell line. Potential 
alterations in antigenicity conferred by amino acid changes in the spike protein 
that include three substitutions (Y453F, I692V, and M1229I) and a loss of two 
amino acid residues 69 and 70 (ΔH69/V70), were evaluated in a virus 
microneutralization assay. Compared to a reference strain, the Cluster 5 variant 
showed reduced neutralization in a proportion of convalescent human COVID-19 
samples. The findings underscore the need for active surveillance SARS-CoV-2 
infection and virus evolution in susceptible animal hosts.
