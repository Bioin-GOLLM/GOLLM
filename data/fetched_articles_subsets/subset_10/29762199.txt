OBJECTIVE: We conducted a gene-environment interaction study to evaluate whether 
the association of body mass index (BMI) associated meta genome-wide association 
study single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (as a genetic risk score) and BMI 
is modified by physical activity and age.
METHODS: In 8,206 women of European ancestry from the Women's Health Initiative 
(WHI), we used linear regression to examine main effects of the 95 SNP BMI 
genetic risk score (GRS) and physical activity on BMI, and evaluated whether 
genetic associations are modified by physical activity (two-way interaction) and 
age (three-way interaction).
RESULTS: We found evidence for modification of the BMI GRS-BMI association 
according to both physical activity and age. We observed a significant two-way 
interaction of BMI GRS × physical activity in the crude model (P 
interaction = 0.05), where a smaller effect of the BMI GRS on BMI with 
increasing physical activity. The beta coefficient was 0.05 (standard error 
[SE] = 0.02, P = 0.01) for the high-activity group compared with beta = 0.13 
(SE = 0.02, P = 4.8 × 10) for the sedentary group. The three-way interaction was 
statistically significant (adjusted P interaction = 0.01). Notably, in the 70+ 
age group, the BMI GRS-BMI association was attenuated and no longer significant 
in the high-activity group; the beta coefficient for the 70+ high-activity group 
was relatively small and nonsignificant (beta = 0.02, SE = 0.03, P = 0.58) 
compared with 70+ sedentary group (beta = 0.17, SE = 0.03, P = 2.5 × 10).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that physical activity attenuates the influence 
of genetic predisposition to obesity, and this effect is more profound in the 
oldest age group.
