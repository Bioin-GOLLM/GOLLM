Newly generated neurons pass through a series of well-defined developmental 
stages, which allow them to integrate into existing neuronal circuits. After 
exit from the cell cycle, postmitotic neurons undergo neuronal migration, axonal 
elongation, axon pruning, dendrite morphogenesis and synaptic maturation and 
plasticity. Lack of a global metabolic analysis during early cortical neuronal 
development led us to explore the role of cellular metabolism and mitochondrial 
biology during ex vivo differentiation of primary cortical neurons. 
Unexpectedly, we observed a huge increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. Changes 
in mitochondrial mass, morphology and function were correlated with the 
upregulation of the master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, TFAM and 
PGC-1α. Concomitant with mitochondrial biogenesis, we observed an increase in 
glucose metabolism during neuronal differentiation, which was linked to an 
increase in glucose uptake and enhanced GLUT3 mRNA expression and platelet 
isoform of phosphofructokinase 1 (PFKp) protein expression. In addition, 
glutamate-glutamine metabolism was also increased during the differentiation of 
cortical neurons. We identified PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling as a critical regulator 
role of energy metabolism in neurons. Selective pharmacological inhibition of 
these metabolic pathways indicate existence of metabolic checkpoint that need to 
be satisfied in order to allow neuronal differentiation.
