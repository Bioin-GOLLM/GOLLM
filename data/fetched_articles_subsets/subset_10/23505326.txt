Deprotonation of carbon and decarboxylation at enzyme active sites proceed 
through the same carbanion intermediates as for the uncatalyzed reactions in 
water. The mechanism for the enzymatic reactions can be studied at the same 
level of detail as for nonenzymatic reactions, using the mechanistic tools 
developed by physical organic chemists. Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) 
catalyzed interconversion of D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone 
phosphate is being studied as a prototype for enzyme catalyzed proton transfer, 
and orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC) catalyzed decarboxylation of 
orotidine 5'-monophosphate is being studied as a prototype for enzyme-catalyzed 
decarboxylation. 1H NMR spectroscopy is an excellent analytical method to 
monitor proton transfer to and from carbon catalyzed by these enzymes in D2O. 
Studies of these partial enzyme-catalyzed exchange reactions provide novel 
insight into the stability of carbanion reaction intermediates, that is not 
accessible in studies of the full enzymatic reaction. The importance of flexible 
enzyme loops and the contribution of interactions between these loops and the 
substrate phosphodianion to the enzymatic rate acceleration are discussed. The 
similarity in the interactions of OMPDC and TIM with the phosphodianion of bound 
substrate is emphasized.
