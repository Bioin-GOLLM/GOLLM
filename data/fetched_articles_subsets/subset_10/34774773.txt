The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is currently a global pandemic. 
Extensive investigations have been performed to study the clinical and cellular 
effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies have 
revealed the cellular changes due to the infection and identified a plethora of 
interactors for all SARS-CoV-2 components, except for the longest non-structural 
protein 3 (NSP3). Here, we expressed the full-length NSP3 proteins of SARS-CoV 
and SARS-CoV-2 to investigate their unique and shared functions using 
multi-omics methods. We conducted interactome, phosphoproteome, ubiquitylome, 
transcriptome, and proteome analyses of NSP3-expressing cells. We found that 
NSP3 plays essential roles in cellular functions such as RNA metabolism and 
immune response (e.g., NF-κB signal transduction). Interestingly, we showed that 
SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 has both endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial localizations. 
In addition, SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 is more closely related to mitochondrial ribosomal 
proteins, whereas SARS-CoV NSP3 is related to the cytosolic ribosomal proteins. 
In summary, our integrative multi-omics study of NSP3 improves the understanding 
of the functions of NSP3 and offers potential targets for the development of 
anti-SARS strategies.
