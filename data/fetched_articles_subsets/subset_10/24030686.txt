IMPORTANCE: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common endocrine 
neoplasm. B-type raf kinase (BRAF) V600E mutation has been proposed as a 
negative prognostic indicator in PTC, and patients harboring it should receive 
more aggressive initial therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the significance of BRAF V600E mutation in PTC in the 
largest US sample to date.
DESIGN: We identified patients from our institution's pathology archives 
diagnosed as having PTC and meeting criteria for BRAF mutation testing. Medical 
records were analyzed for BRAF status (positive or negative) and a list of 
standardized clinicopathologic features.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 429 patients with PTC at an academic medical center.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinicopathologic features in patients with PTC with 
and without BRAF mutation.
RESULTS: Of 429 cases with PTC, 314 (73.2%) were positive for the BRAF mutation 
and 115 (26.8%) tested negative. BRAF mutation was significantly associated with 
tumor margin positivity (P = .03) and lymph node metastasis (P = .002) on 
univariate analysis but not on multivariate study. BRAF mutation was a predictor 
of male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.2), total thyroidectomy (OR, 
2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-6.2), and a negative predictor of follicular variant PTC (OR, 
0.1; 95% CI, 0.1-0.4). There was no significant association between BRAF 
positivity and tumor multicentricity, lymphovascular invasion, extranodal 
extension, central neck involvement, advanced stage (stage III or IV), and 
distant metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: BRAF V600E mutation has been extensively studied in 
relation to negative prognostic indicators in PTC, with no consistent 
relationship emerging. Two recent meta-analyses showed an overall association 
between BRAF status and aggressive disease features and called for tailoring 
treatment plans in patients accordingly. In this, the largest US study to date, 
BRAF status was not significantly associated with most clinicopathologic 
features suggestive of more aggressive disease.
