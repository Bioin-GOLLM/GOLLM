Homeobox gene Msx2 is widely expressed during both embryogenesis and postnatal 
development and plays important roles during organogenesis. We developed an 
Msx2-rtTA BAC transgenic line which can activate TetO-Cre expression in 
Msx2-expressing cells upon doxycycline (Dox) treatment. Using the Rosa26-LacZ 
(R26R) reporter line, we show that rtTA is activated in Msx2-expressing organs 
including the limb, heart, external genitalia, urogenital system, hair follicles 
and craniofacial regions. Moreover, we show that in body appendages, the 
transgene can be activated in different domains depending on the timing of Dox 
treatment. In addition, the transgene can also be effectively activated in adult 
tissues such as the hair follicle and the urogenital system. Taken together, 
this Msx2-rtTA;TetO-Cre system is a valuable tool for studying gene function in 
the development of the aforementioned organs in a temporal and 
spatially-restricted manner, as well as for tissue lineage tracing of 
Msx2-expressing cells. When induced postnatally, this system can also be used to 
study gene function in adult tissues without compromising normal development and 
patterning.
