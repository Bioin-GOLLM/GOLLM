Tectorial membrane, an extracellular matrix of the cochlea, plays a crucial role 
in the transmission of sound to the sensory hair cells. Alpha-tectorin is the 
most important noncollagenous component of the tectorial membrane and the 
otolith membrane in the maculae of the vestibular system. Defects in TECTA, the 
gene encodes alpha-tectorin, are cause of both dominant (DFNA8/12) and recessive 
(DFNB21) forms of deafness. Here, we report a three-generation Chinese family 
characterized by prelingual progressive sensorineural hearing impairment. We 
mapped the disease locus to chromosome 11q23-24 region, overlapping with the 
DFNA8/12 locus. Sequencing of candidate gene TECTA revealed a heterozygous 
c.5945C>A substitution in exon 19, causing amino acid substitution of Ala to Asp 
at a conservative position 1982. The A1982D substitution is consistent with 
hearing loss in this Chinese family and has not been found in 200 random control 
chromosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first TECTA mutation identified in 
Chinese population. Our data provides additional molecular and clinical 
information for establishing a better genotype-phenotype understanding of 
DFNA8/12.
