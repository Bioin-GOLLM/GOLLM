BACKGROUND: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated drug efflux across the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) is an important mechanism underlying poor brain penetration of 
certain antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Nanomaterials, as drug carriers, can 
overcome P-gp activity and improve the targeted delivery of AEDs. However, their 
applications in the delivery of AEDs have not been adequately investigated. The 
objective of this study was to develop a nano-scale delivery system to improve 
the solubility and brain penetration of the antiepileptic drug lamotrigine 
(LTG).
METHODS: LTG-loaded Pluronic(®) P123 (P123) polymeric micelles (P123/LTG) were 
prepared by thin-film hydration, and brain penetration capability of the 
nanocarrier was evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean encapsulating efficiency for the optimized formulation was 
98.07%; drug-loading was 5.63%, and particle size was 18.73 nm. The solubility 
of LTG in P123/LTG can increase to 2.17 mg/mL, making it available as a 
solution. The in vitro release of LTG from P123LTG presented a sustained-release 
property. Compared with free LTG, the LTG-incorporated micelles accumulated more 
in the brain at 0.5, 1, and 4 hours after intravenous administration in rats. 
Pretreatment with systemic verapamil increased the rapid brain penetration of 
free LTG but not P123/LTG. Incorporating another P-gp substrate (Rhodamine 123) 
into P123 micelles also showed higher efficiency in penetrating the BBB in vitro 
and in vivo.
CONCLUSION: These results indicated that P123 micelles have the potential to 
overcome the activity of P-gp expressed on the BBB and therefore show potential 
for the targeted delivery of AEDs. Future studies are necessary to further 
evaluate the appropriateness of the nanocarrier to enhance the efficacy of AEDs.
