Increased vascular permeability is a hallmark of several cardiovascular 
anomalies, including ischaemia/reperfusion injury and inflammation. During both 
ischaemia/reperfusion and inflammation, massive amounts of various nucleotides, 
particularly adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine, are released that 
can induce a plethora of signalling pathways via activation of several 
purinergic receptors and may affect endothelial barrier properties. The nature 
of the effects on endothelial barrier function may depend on the prevalence and 
type of purinergic receptors activated in a particular tissue. In this review, 
we discuss the influence of the activation of various purinergic receptors and 
downstream signalling pathways on vascular permeability during pathological 
conditions.
