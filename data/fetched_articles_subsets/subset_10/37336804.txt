BACKGROUND: The TAS2R38 gene carries markers for phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) 
sensitivity. Various studies have investigated the genotype-phenotype 
association pattern for bitter tasting ability and other factors in different 
populations. However, a paucity of such information for endogamous Indian 
populations is the reason behind this study.
OBJECTIVE: To study the association of phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) sensitivity 
with TAS2R38 gene variations in Koṅkaṇī Sārasvata Brahmin population.
METHODS: We studied the association of the alleles rs714598, rs1726866, 
rs10246939 with PTC sensitivity and other factors in the Koṅkaṇī Sārasvata 
Brahmin population. DNA was extracted from 114 individuals belonging to the 
Koṅkaṇī Sārasvata Brahmin community. The TAS2R38 gene was sequenced to find the 
genotype distribution pattern. The association between genotype and phenotype 
was checked using the Chi-Square test and multifactorial logistical regression.
RESULTS: We observed a 58.8% frequency of the AVI haplotype, which is the most 
prevalent in European populations. A higher number of non-taster haplotypes and 
diplotypes were observed in Koṅkaṇī Sārasvata Brahmins, with the allele 
rs10246939 showing a significant association with PTC bitter taste sensitivity 
in both allelic (p = 8.6 × 10-4; Allele-G, OR = 3.57 [95% CI = 1.66-7.69]) and 
genotype-based (p = 6.9 × 10-4; genotype-AG, OR = 3.11 [95% CI = 0.73-13.20]; 
genotype-GG, OR = 40 [95% CI = 3.58-447.03]) tests.
CONCLUSION: Our results are in line with earlier studies, which report an 
association between PTC sensitivity and the TAS2R38 gene in different 
populations. In the global context, Koṅkaṇī Sārasvata Brahmins, who are mostly 
distributed along the southwestern coast of India, show a PTC sensitivity 
pattern slightly similar to that of West Eurasian populations. Our findings 
suggest ancestry specific selection in TAS2R38 gene variations for taste 
sensitivity at global level.
