The interplay of translation and mRNA turnover has helped unveil how the 
regulation of gene expression is a continuum in which events that occur during 
the birth of a transcript in the nucleus can have profound effects on subsequent 
steps in the cytoplasm. Exemplifying this continuum is nonsense-mediated mRNA 
decay (NMD), the process wherein a premature stop codon affects both translation 
and mRNA decay. Studies of NMD helped lead us to the therapeutic concept of 
treating a subset of patients suffering from multiple genetic disorders due to 
nonsense mutations with a single small-molecule drug that modulates the 
translation termination process at a premature nonsense codon. Here we review 
both translation termination and NMD, and our subsequent efforts over the past 
15 years that led to the identification, characterization, and clinical testing 
of ataluren, a new therapeutic with the potential to treat a broad range of 
genetic disorders due to nonsense mutations.
