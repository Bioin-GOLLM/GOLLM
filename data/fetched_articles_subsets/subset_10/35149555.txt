SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that evades antiviral immunity by 
interfering with host protein synthesis, mRNA stability, and protein 
trafficking. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) uses its C-terminal 
domain to block the messenger RNA (mRNA) entry channel of the 40S ribosome to 
inhibit host protein synthesis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents 
Nsp1-mediated suppression for viral protein synthesis and if the mechanism can 
be targeted therapeutically remain unclear. Here, we show that N- and C-terminal 
domains of Nsp1 coordinate to drive a tuned ratio of viral to host translation, 
likely to maintain a certain level of host fitness while maximizing replication. 
We reveal that the stem-loop 1 (SL1) region of the SARS-CoV-2 5' untranslated 
region (5' UTR) is necessary and sufficient to evade Nsp1-mediated translational 
suppression. Targeting SL1 with locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides 
inhibits viral translation and makes SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR vulnerable to Nsp1 
suppression, hindering viral replication in vitro at a nanomolar concentration, 
as well as providing protection against SARS-CoV-2-induced lethality in 
transgenic mice expressing human ACE2. Thus, SL1 allows Nsp1 to switch infected 
cells from host to SARS-CoV-2 translation, presenting a therapeutic target 
against COVID-19 that is conserved among immune-evasive variants. This unique 
strategy of unleashing a virus' own virulence mechanism against itself could 
force a critical trade-off between drug resistance and pathogenicity.
