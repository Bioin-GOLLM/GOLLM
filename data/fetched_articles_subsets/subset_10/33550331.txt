OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between the abnormal root morphology and 
bone metabolism or root development related gene polymorphism in patients with 
generalized aggressive periodontitis.
METHODS: In the study, 179 patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis 
were enrolled, with an average age of (27.23±5.19) years, male / female = 
67/112. The average number of teeth remaining in the mouth was (26.80±1.84). 
Thirteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of nine genes which related to 
bone metabolism and root development were detected by matrix assisted laser 
desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Root 
abnormalities were identified using periapical radiographs. The abnormal root 
morphology included cone-rooted teeth, slender-root teeth, short-rooted teeth, 
curved-rooted teeth, syncretic-rooted molars, and molar root abnormalities. The 
number of teeth and incidence of abnormal root morphology in different genotypes 
of 13 SNPs were analyzed.
RESULTS: The constituent ratio of root with root abnormality in GAgP patients 
was 14.49%(695/4 798). The average number of teeth with abnormal root morphology 
in GAgP was (3.88±3.84). The average number of teeth with abnormal root 
morphology in CC, CT and TT genotypes in vitamin D receptor (VDR) rs2228570 was 
(4.66±4.10), (3.71±3.93) and (2.68±2.68). There was significant difference 
between TT genotype and CC genotype (t = 2.62, P =0.01). The average number of 
root morphological abnormalities in CC, CT and TT genotypes of Calcitotin 
Receptor (CTR) gene rs2283002 was (5.02±3.70), (3.43±3.95), and (3.05±3.12). The 
incidence of root morphological abnormalities in CC genotype was higher than 
that in the patients with CT and TT, and the difference was statistically 
significant(87.86% vs. 65.26% & 63.64%, P=0.006, adjusted OR =3.71, 95%CI: 
1.45-9.50). There was no significant difference in the incidence of abnormal 
root morphology between CT and TT genotypes.
CONCLUSION: VDR rs2228570 and CTR rs2283002 may be associated with the 
occurrence of abnormal root morphology in patients with generalized aggressive 
periodontitis, which is worthy of further research.

目的: 探索广泛型侵袭性牙周炎(generalized aggressive 
periodontitis，GAgP)患者牙根形态异常与骨代谢或牙根发育相关基因多态性的关联。
方法: 纳入179例GAgP患者，平均(27.23±5.19)岁，男:女=67 : 
112，平均存留牙数(26.80±1.84)颗。采用基于基质辅助激光解吸电离飞行时间质谱技术进行9个与骨代谢和牙根发育相关基因的13个单核苷酸多态性位点(single 
nucleotide 
polymorphisms，SNPs)的基因型检测。采用全口根尖片评判牙根形态异常，包括锥根、细长根、冠根比例失调、弯曲根、融合根、后牙根形态异常，分析13个SNPs位点不同基因型根形态异常牙的数量及发生率。
结果: GAgP患者根形态异常牙构成比为14.49%(695/4 798颗)，平均(3.88±3.84)颗。维生素D受体(vitamin D 
receptor，VDR)基因rs2228570位点的CC、CT、TT基因型患者根形态异常牙数量分别为(4.66±4.10)、(3.71±3.93)和(2.68±2.68)颗，CC基因型和TT基因型之间差异有统计学意义(t=2.62，P=0.01)。降钙素受体(calcitotin 
receptor，CTR)基因rs2283002位点CC、CT、TT基因型患者根形态异常数分别为(5.02±3.70)、(3.43±3.95)、(3.05±3.12)颗，CC基因型的根形态异常发病率高于CT和TT基因型(87.86% 
vs. 65.26%和63.64%，P=0.006，adjusted OR=3.71，95%CI:1.45~9.50)。
结论: VDR rs2228570及CTR rs2283002位点可能与广泛型侵袭性牙周炎患者牙根形态异常的发生有关，值得进一步研究。
