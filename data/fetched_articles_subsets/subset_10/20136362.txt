Similar to other common chronic diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple disease subtypes. Candidate 
gene studies have found genetic associations for COPD-related phenotypes that 
may be relevant for pharmacogenetics studies, including lung function decline 
and COPD exacerbations. However, few COPD pharmacogenetics studies have been 
completed. Most studies have focused on the role of variants in the 
beta(2)-adrenergic receptor gene on bronchodilator response, but the findings 
have been inconclusive. Candidate gene studies highlight the concept that genes 
for COPD susceptibility may also be relevant in COPD pharmacogenetics. 
Currently, there are no clinical applications of pharmacogenetics to COPD 
therapy, but the use of pharmacogenetics to determine initial smoking cessation 
therapy may be closer to clinical application.
