Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication occurs in the cytosol of infected cells 
within a specialised membranous compartment. How the viral non-structural (NS) 
proteins are associated and organised within these structures remains poorly 
defined. We employed a super-resolution microscopy approach to visualise NS3 and 
NS5A in HCV infected cells. Using single molecule localisation microscopy, both 
NS proteins were resolved as clusters of localisations smaller than the 
diffraction-limited volume observed by wide-field. Analysis of the protein 
clusters identified a significant difference in size between the NS proteins. We 
also observed a reduction in NS5A cluster size following inhibition of RNA 
replication using daclatasvir, a phenotype which was maintained in the presence 
of the Y93H resistance associated substitution and not observed for NS3 
clusters. These results provide insight into the NS protein organisation within 
hepatitis C virus RNA replication complexes and the mode of action of NS5A 
inhibitors.
