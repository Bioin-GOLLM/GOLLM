GBM (Glioblastoma) is the most lethal CNS (Central nervous system) tumor in 
adults, which inevitably develops resistance to standard treatments leading to 
recurrence and mortality. TRIB1 is a serine/threonine pseudokinase which 
functions as a scaffold platform that initiates degradation of its substrates 
like C/EBPα through the ubiquitin proteasome system and also activates MEK and 
Akt signaling. We found that increased TRIB1 gene expression associated with 
worse overall survival of GBM patients across multiple cohorts. Importantly, 
overexpression of TRIB1 decreased RT/TMZ (radiation 
therapy/temozolomide)-induced apoptosis in patient derived GBM cell lines in 
vitro. TRIB1 directly bound to MEK and Akt and increased ERK and Akt 
phosphorylation/activation. We also found that TRIB1 protein expression was 
maximal during G2/M transition of cell cycle in GBM cells. Furthermore, TRIB1 
bound directly to HDAC1 and p53. Importantly, mice bearing TRIB1 overexpressing 
tumors had worse overall survival. Collectively, these data suggest that TRIB1 
induces resistance of GBM cells to RT/TMZ treatments by activating the cell 
proliferation and survival pathways thus providing an opportunity for developing 
new targeted therapeutics.
