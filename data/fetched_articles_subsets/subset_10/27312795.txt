Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) is an entity of B-cell lymphoma 
distinct from the other molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL). We investigated the prevalence, specificity, and clinical relevance of 
mutations of XPO1, which encodes a member of the karyopherin-β nuclear 
transporters, in a large cohort of PMBL. PMBL cases defined histologically or by 
gene expression profiling (GEP) were sequenced and the XPO1 mutational status 
was correlated to genetic and clinical characteristics. The XPO1 mutational 
status was also assessed in DLBCL, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and mediastinal 
gray-zone lymphoma (MGZL).The biological impact of the mutation on Selective 
Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds (KPT-185/330) sensitivity was 
investigated in vitro. XPO1 mutations were present in 28/117 (24%) PMBL cases 
and in 5/19 (26%) HL cases but absent/rare in MGZL (0/20) or DLBCL (3/197). A 
higher prevalence (50%) of the recurrent codon 571 variant (p.E571K) was 
observed in GEP-defined PMBL and was associated with shorter PFS. Age, 
International Prognostic Index and bulky mass were similar in XPO1 mutant and 
wild-type cases. KPT-185 induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation 
and increased cell-death in PMBL cell lines harboring wild type or XPO1 E571K 
mutant alleles. Experiments in transfected U2OS cells further confirmed that the 
XPO1 E571K mutation does not have a drastic impact on KPT-330 binding. To 
conclude the XPO1 E571K mutation represents a genetic hallmark of the PMBL 
subtype and serves as a new relevant PMBL biomarker. SINE compounds appear 
active for both mutated and wild-type protein. Am. J. Hematol. 91:923-930, 2016.
