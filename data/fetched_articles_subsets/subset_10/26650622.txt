SIGNIFICANCE: 8-Hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is generated after the repair 
of ROS-mediated DNA damages and, thus, is one of the most widely recognized 
biomarkers of oxidative damage of DNA because guanosine is the most oxidized 
among the DNA nucleobases. In several pathological conditions, high urinary 
levels of oxidized DNA-derived metabolites have been reported (e.g., cancer, 
atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes).
RECENT ADVANCES: Even if published studies have shown that DNA damage is 
significantly associated with the development of atherosclerosis, the exact role 
of this damage in the onset and progression of this pathology is not fully 
understood, and the association of oxidative damage to DNA with cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) still needs to be more extensively investigated. We performed a 
meta-analysis of the literature to investigate the association among 8-OHdG 
levels and CVD.
CRITICAL ISSUES: Fourteen studies (810 CVD patients and 1106 controls) were 
included in the analysis. We found that CVD patients showed higher 8-OHdG levels 
than controls (SMD: 1.04, 95%CI: 0.61, 1.47, p < 0.001, I(2) = 94%, p < 0.001). 
The difference was confirmed both in studies in which 8-OHdG levels were 
assessed in urine (MD: 4.43, 95%CI: 1.71, 7.15, p = 0.001) and in blood samples 
(MD: 1.42, 95%CI: 0.64, 2.21, p = 0.0004). Meta-regression models showed that 
age, hypertension, and male gender significantly impacted on the difference in 
8-OHdG levels among CVD patients and controls.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: 8-OHdG levels are higher in patients with CVD than in 
controls. However, larger prospective studies are needed to test 8-OHdG as a 
predictor of CVD.
