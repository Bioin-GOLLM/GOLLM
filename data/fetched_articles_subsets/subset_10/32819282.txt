BACKGROUND: The investigation of transcriptome profiles using short reads in 
non-model organisms, which lack of well-annotated genomes, is limited by partial 
gene reconstruction and isoform detection. In contrast, long-reads sequencing 
techniques revealed their potential to generate complete transcript assemblies 
even when a reference genome is lacking. Cynara cardunculus var. altilis (DC) 
(cultivated cardoon) is a perennial hardy crop adapted to dry environments with 
many industrial and nutraceutical applications due to the richness of secondary 
metabolites mostly produced in flower heads. The investigation of this species 
benefited from the recent release of a draft genome, but the transcriptome 
profile during the capitula formation still remains unexplored. In the present 
study we show a transcriptome analysis of vegetative and inflorescence organs of 
cultivated cardoon through a novel hybrid RNA-seq assembly approach utilizing 
both long and short RNA-seq reads.
RESULTS: The inclusion of a single Nanopore flow-cell output in a hybrid 
sequencing approach determined an increase of 15% complete assembled genes and 
18% transcript isoforms respect to short reads alone. Among 25,463 assembled 
unigenes, we identified 578 new genes and updated 13,039 gene models, 11,169 of 
which were alternatively spliced isoforms. During capitulum development, 3424 
genes were differentially expressed and approximately two-thirds were identified 
as transcription factors including bHLH, MYB, NAC, C2H2 and MADS-box which were 
highly expressed especially after capitulum opening. We also show the expression 
dynamics of key genes involved in the production of valuable secondary 
metabolites of which capitulum is rich such as phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and 
sesquiterpene lactones. Most of their biosynthetic genes were strongly 
transcribed in the flower heads with alternative isoforms exhibiting 
differentially expression levels across the tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel hybrid sequencing approach allowed to improve the 
transcriptome assembly, to update more than half of annotated genes and to 
identify many novel genes and different alternatively spliced isoforms. This 
study provides new insights on the flowering cycle in an Asteraceae plant, a 
valuable resource for plant biology and breeding in Cynara and an effective 
method for improving gene annotation.
