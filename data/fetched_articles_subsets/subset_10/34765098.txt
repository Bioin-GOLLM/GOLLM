The accurate annotation of protein localization is crucial in understanding 
protein function in tandem with a broad range of applications such as 
pathological analysis and drug design. Since most proteins do not have 
experimentally-determined localization information, the computational prediction 
of protein localization has been an active research area for more than two 
decades. In particular, recent machine-learning advancements have fueled the 
development of new methods in protein localization prediction. In this review 
paper, we first categorize the main features and algorithms used for protein 
localization prediction. Then, we summarize a list of protein localization 
prediction tools in terms of their coverage, characteristics, and accessibility 
to help users find suitable tools based on their needs. Next, we evaluate some 
of these tools on a benchmark dataset. Finally, we provide an outlook on the 
future exploration of protein localization methods.
