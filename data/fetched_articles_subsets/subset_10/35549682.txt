BACKGROUND: Dent disease is an X-linked disorder characterized by low molecular 
weight proteinuria (LMWP), hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis and chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). It is caused by mutations in the chloride voltage-gated channel 5 
(CLCN5) gene (Dent disease-1), or in the OCRL gene (Dent disease-2). It is 
associated with chronic metabolic acidosis; however metabolic alkalosis has 
rarely been reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a family with Dent-2 disease and a Bartter-like 
phenotype. The main clinical problems observed in the proband included a) 
primary phosphaturia leading to osteomalacia and stunted growth; b) elevated 
serum calcitriol levels, leading to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, 
nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis; c) severe salt wasting causing 
hypotension, hyperaldosteronism, hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis; d) partial 
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus attributed to hypercalcemia, hypokalemia and 
nephrocalcinosis; e) albuminuria, LMWP. Phosphorous repletion resulted in abrupt 
cessation of hypercalciuria and significant improvement of hypophosphatemia, 
physical stamina and bone histology. Years later, he presented progressive CKD 
with nephrotic range proteinuria attributed to focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Targeted genetic analysis for several phosphaturic 
diseases was unsuccessful. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) revealed a c.1893C > A 
variant (Asp631Glu) in the OCRL gene which was co-segregated with the disease in 
male family members.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the clinical characteristics of the Asp631Glu mutation 
in the OCRL gene, presenting as Dent-2 disease with Bartter-like features. 
Phosphorous repletion resulted in significant improvement of all clinical 
features except for progressive CKD. Angiotensin blockade improved proteinuria 
and stabilized kidney function for several years.
