Complex insertions and deletions (indels) are formed by simultaneously deleting 
and inserting DNA fragments of different sizes at a common genomic location. 
Here we present a systematic analysis of somatic complex indels in the coding 
sequences of samples from over 8,000 cancer cases using Pindel-C. We discovered 
285 complex indels in cancer-associated genes (such as PIK3R1, TP53, ARID1A, 
GATA3 and KMT2D) in approximately 3.5% of cases analyzed; nearly all instances 
of complex indels were overlooked (81.1%) or misannotated (17.6%) in previous 
reports of 2,199 samples. In-frame complex indels are enriched in PIK3R1 and 
EGFR, whereas frameshifts are prevalent in VHL, GATA3, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN and 
ATRX. Furthermore, complex indels display strong tissue specificity (such as VHL 
in kidney cancer samples and GATA3 in breast cancer samples). Finally, 
structural analyses support findings of previously missed, but potentially 
druggable, mutations in the EGFR, MET and KIT oncogenes. This study indicates 
the critical importance of improving complex indel discovery and interpretation 
in medical research.
