Posttranslational modifications of histone tails regulate numerous biological 
processes including transcription, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Although recent 
studies suggest that structural alterations in chromatin are critical for 
triggering the DNA damage response, very little is known about the nature of DNA 
damage-induced chromatin perturbations. Here we show that the serine 14 residue 
in the NH(2)-terminal tail of histone H2B is rapidly phosphorylated at sites of 
DNA double-strand breaks. At late time points after irradiation, the 
phosphorylated form of H2B, H2B-(Ser14P), accumulates into irradiation-induced 
foci. H2B-(Ser14P) foci formation is not associated with the apoptotic 
phosphorylation of H2B but is strictly dependent on the phosphorylated isoform 
of H2AX. Our results broaden the spectrum of histone modifications that 
constitute the DNA damage "histone code" and suggest a model for the underlying 
chromatin structure within damage-induced foci.
