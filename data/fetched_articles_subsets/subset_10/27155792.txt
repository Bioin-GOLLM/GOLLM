BACKGROUND: The toll-like receptors-(TLR)-2 and -4 play a role in the innate 
immune system and drive the autoimmune T cell cascade in psoriasis. But little 
is known about the association of the polymorphisms of TLR2/TLR4 and psoriasis 
vulgaris (PsV).
METHODS: We performed a hospital-based association study involved in355 PsV 
patients and 213 controls. Genotyping of 11 SNPs rs4696480(-16934A/T), 
rs121917864 (2029C/T;Arg677Trp), rs5743708 (2408G/A;Arg753Gln), rs3804099 
(+597T/C), rs5743699(+1349T/C) of TLR2 on chromosome 4q32; and rs1927914 
(-6143A/G), rs10759932(-5724T/C), rs4986790 (896A/G; Asp299Gly), rs4986791 
(1196C/T; Thr399lle); rs11536889(+7263G/C), rs11536891(+8469T/C) of TLR4 on 
chromosome 9q33.1 were determined using SNaPshot Multiplex Kit (Applied 
Biosystems Co., USA).
RESULTS: We did not detect the presence of any of the five rare SNPs (rs5743708, 
rs121917864, rs5743699, rs4986790, rs4986791). The comparison of allele 
distributions revealed that only one SNP (rs3804099) of 6 common 
SNPs(rs10759932, rs11536889, rs11536891, rs1927914, rs3804099, rs4696480) was 
significant associated with the risk of PsV (P<0.01; FDR p-Value). However, 
there were no significant differences found in other subphenotypes of family 
history or PASI between patients positive and those negative for a particular 
phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: The SNP rs3804099 of TLR2 may have significant effects on 
heritability of PsV in our Chinese population. TLR2 and its pathway might take 
part in the pathogenesis of PsV.
