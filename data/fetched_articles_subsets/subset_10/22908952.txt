Inherited mutations of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) 
give rise to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) or variants (LNV). We report molecular 
insights from real-time RT-PCR for HPRT mRNA quantification into the mechanism 
by which a single mutation located in exon 7 of the HPRT gene: c.500G>T, 
p.R167M, led to different clinical phenotypes from three male LNV-affected 
patients in the same family manifesting parallel differences in enzymatic 
activities. This approach can be applied for understanding genotype-phenotype 
correlations for other human genetic diseases.
