BACKGROUND: The forkhead box F2 gene (FOXF2) located in chromosome 6p25.3 has 
been shown to play a crucial role in palatal development in mouse and rat 
models. To date, no evidence of linkage or association has been reported for 
this gene in humans with oral clefts.
METHODS: Allelic transmission disequilibrium tests were used to robustly assess 
evidence of linkage and association with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without 
cleft palate for nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and around FOXF2 
in both Asian and European trios using PLINK.
RESULTS: Statistically significant evidence of linkage and association was shown 
for two SNPs (rs1711968 and rs732835) in 216 Asian trios where the empiric P 
values with permutation tests were 0.0016 and 0.005, respectively. The 
corresponding estimated odds ratios for carrying the minor allele at these SNPs 
were 2.05 (95% confidence interval = 1.41, 2.98) and 1.77 (95% confidence 
interval = 1.26, 2.49), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results provided statistical evidence of linkage and association 
between FOXF2 and nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate.
