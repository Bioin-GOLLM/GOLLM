RecA plays a key role in homologous recombination, the induction of the DNA 
damage response through LexA cleavage and the activity of error-prone polymerase 
in Escherichia coli. RecA interacts with multiple partners to achieve this 
pleiotropic role, but the structural location and sequence determinants involved 
in these multiple interactions remain mostly unknown. Here, in a first 
application to prokaryotes, Evolutionary Trace (ET) analysis identifies clusters 
of evolutionarily important surface amino acids involved in RecA functions. Some 
of these clusters match the known ATP binding, DNA binding, and RecA-RecA 
homo-dimerization sites, but others are novel. Mutation analysis at these sites 
disrupted either recombination or LexA cleavage. This highlights distinct 
functional sites specific for recombination and DNA damage response induction. 
Finally, our analysis reveals a composite site for LexA binding and cleavage, 
which is formed only on the active RecA filament. These new sites can provide 
new drug targets to modulate one or more RecA functions, with the potential to 
address the problem of evolution of antibiotic resistance at its root.
