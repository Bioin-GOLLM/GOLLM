Organisms have evolved elaborate physiological pathways that regulate growth, 
proliferation, metabolism, and stress response. These pathways must be properly 
coordinated to elicit the appropriate response to an ever-changing environment. 
While individual pathways have been well studied in a variety of model systems, 
there remains much to uncover about how pathways are integrated to produce 
systemic changes in a cell, especially in dynamic conditions. We previously 
showed that deletion of Protein Kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit BCY1 can 
decouple growth and metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae engineered for 
anaerobic xylose fermentation, allowing for robust fermentation in the absence 
of division. This provides an opportunity to understand how PKA signaling 
normally coordinates these processes. Here, we integrated transcriptomic, 
lipidomic, and phospho-proteomic responses upon a glucose to xylose shift across 
a series of strains with different genetic mutations promoting either coupled or 
decoupled xylose-dependent growth and metabolism. Together, results suggested 
that defects in lipid homeostasis limit growth in the bcy1Δ strain despite 
robust metabolism. To further understand this mechanism, we performed adaptive 
laboratory evolutions to re-evolve coupled growth and metabolism in the bcy1Δ 
parental strain. The evolved strain harbored mutations in PKA subunit TPK1 and 
lipid regulator OPI1, among other genes, and evolved changes in lipid profiles 
and gene expression. Deletion of the evolved opi1 gene partially reverted the 
strain's phenotype to the bcy1Δ parent, with reduced growth and robust xylose 
fermentation. We suggest several models for how cells coordinate growth, 
metabolism, and other responses in budding yeast and how restructuring these 
processes enables anaerobic xylose utilization.
