Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) constitute a heterogeneous group of lysosomal 
storage disorders characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Although lysosomal dysfunction is mainly affected, 
several cellular organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi 
apparatus, and their related process are also impaired, leading to the 
activation of pathophysiological cascades. While supplying missing enzymes is 
the mainstream for the treatment of MPS, including enzyme replacement therapy 
(ERT), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), or gene therapy (GT), the 
use of modulators available to restore affected organelles for recovering cell 
homeostasis may be a simultaneous approach. This review summarizes the current 
knowledge about the cellular consequences of the lysosomal GAGs accumulation and 
discusses the use of potential modulators that can reestablish normal cell 
function beyond ERT-, HSCT-, or GT-based alternatives.
