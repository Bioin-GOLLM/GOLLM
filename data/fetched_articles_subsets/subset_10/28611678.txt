"Amelogenesis imperfecta" (AI) describes a group of genetic conditions that 
result in defects in tooth enamel formation. Mutations in many genes are known 
to cause AI, including the gene encoding the serine protease, kallikrein related 
peptidase 4 (KLK4), expressed during the maturation stage of amelogenesis. In 
this study we report the fourth KLK4 mutation to be identified in autosomal 
recessively-inherited hypomaturation type AI, c.632delT, p.(L211Rfs*37) 
(NM_004917.4, NP_004908.4). This homozygous variant was identified in five 
Pakistani AI families and is predicted to result in a transcript with a 
premature stop codon that escapes nonsense mediated decay. However, the protein 
may misfold, as three of six disulphide bonds would be disrupted, and may be 
degraded or non-functional as a result. Primary teeth were obtained from one 
affected individual. The enamel phenotype was characterized using 
high-resolution computerized X-ray tomography (CT), scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and microhardness testing 
(MH). Enamel from the affected individual (referred to as KLK4 enamel) was 
hypomineralised in comparison with matched control enamel. Furthermore, KLK4 
inner enamel was hypomineralised compared with KLK4 outer enamel. SEM showed a 
clear structural demarcation between KLK4 inner and outer enamel, although 
enamel structure was similar to control tissue overall. EDX showed that KLK4 
inner enamel contained less calcium and phosphorus and more nitrogen than 
control inner enamel and KLK4 outer enamel. MH testing showed that KLK4 inner 
enamel was significantly softer than KLK4 outer enamel (p < 0.001). However, the 
hardness of control inner enamel was not significantly different to that of 
control outer enamel. Overall, these findings suggest that the KLK4 c.632delT 
mutation may be a common cause of autosomal recessive AI in the Pakistani 
population. The phenotype data obtained mirror findings in the Klk4-/- mouse and 
suggest that KLK4 is required for the hardening and mineralization of the inner 
enamel layer but is less essential for hardening and mineralization of the outer 
enamel layer.
