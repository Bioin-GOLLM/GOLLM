Advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with imatinib often 
relapse due to point mutations in the Abl kinase domain. We herein examine the 
in vitro and in vivo effects of a Bcr-Abl/Lyn dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 
NS-187, on seven mutated Bcr-Abl proteins. NS-187 inhibited both 
Tyr393-phosphorylated and Tyr393-unphosphorylated Abl, resulting in significant 
in vitro growth inhibition of cells expressing six of seven mutated Bcr-Abl 
kinases, though not T315I. Furthermore, NS-187 prolonged the survival of mice 
injected with leukemic cells expressing all mutated Bcr-Abl tested except T315I, 
and its efficacy correlated well with its in vitro effects.
