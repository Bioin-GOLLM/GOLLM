Multiple cellular functions are controlled by the interaction of RNAs and 
proteins. Together with the RNAs they control, RNA interacting proteins form RNA 
protein complexes, which are considered to serve as the true regulatory units 
for post-transcriptional gene expression. To understand how RNAs are modified, 
transported, and regulated therefore requires specific knowledge of their 
interaction partners. To this end, multiple techniques have been developed to 
characterize the interaction between RNAs and proteins. In this review, we 
briefly summarize the common methods to study RNA-protein interaction including 
crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), and aptamer- or antisense 
oligonucleotide-based RNA affinity purification. Following this, we focus on in 
vivo proximity labeling to study RNA-protein interactions. In proximity 
labeling, a labeling enzyme like ascorbate peroxidase or biotin ligase is 
targeted to specific RNAs, RNA-binding proteins, or even cellular compartments 
and uses biotin to label the proteins and RNAs in its vicinity. The tagged 
molecules are then enriched and analyzed by mass spectrometry or RNA-Seq. We 
highlight the latest studies that exemplify the strength of this approach for 
the characterization of RNA protein complexes and distribution of RNAs in vivo.
