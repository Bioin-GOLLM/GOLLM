Reptiles are the most morphologically and physiologically diverse tetrapods, and 
have undergone 300 million years of adaptive evolution. Within the reptilian 
tetrapods, geckos possess several interesting features, including the ability to 
regenerate autotomized tails and to climb on smooth surfaces. Here we sequence 
the genome of Gekko japonicus (Schlegel's Japanese Gecko) and investigate 
genetic elements related to its physiology. We obtain a draft G. japonicus 
genome sequence of 2.55â€‰Gb and annotated 22,487 genes. Comparative genomic 
analysis reveals specific gene family expansions or reductions that are 
associated with the formation of adhesive setae, nocturnal vision and tail 
regeneration, as well as the diversification of olfactory sensation. The 
obtained genomic data provide robust genetic evidence of adaptive evolution in 
reptiles.
