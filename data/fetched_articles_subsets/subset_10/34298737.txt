Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal soft 
tissue sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract. The management of locally advanced 
or metastatic unresectable GIST involves detecting KIT, PDGFR, or other 
molecular alterations targeted by imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
The role of immunotherapy in soft tissue sarcomas is growing fast due to 
multiple clinical and pre-clinical studies with no current standard of care. The 
potential therapies include cytokine-based therapy, immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, anti-KIT monoclonal antibodies, bi-specific monoclonal antibodies, 
and cell-based therapies. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the 
immunotherapeutic strategies for GIST.
