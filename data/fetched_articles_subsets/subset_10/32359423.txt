Cells sense elevated temperatures and mount an adaptive heat shock response that 
involves changes in gene expression, but the underlying mechanisms, particularly 
on the level of translation, remain unknown. Here we report that, in budding 
yeast, the essential translation initiation factor Ded1p undergoes heat-induced 
phase separation into gel-like condensates. Using ribosome profiling and an 
in vitro translation assay, we reveal that condensate formation inactivates 
Ded1p and represses translation of housekeeping mRNAs while promoting 
translation of stress mRNAs. Testing a variant of Ded1p with altered phase 
behavior as well as Ded1p homologs from diverse species, we demonstrate that 
Ded1p condensation is adaptive and fine-tuned to the maximum growth temperature 
of the respective organism. We conclude that Ded1p condensation is an integral 
part of an extended heat shock response that selectively represses translation 
of housekeeping mRNAs to promote survival under conditions of severe heat 
stress.
