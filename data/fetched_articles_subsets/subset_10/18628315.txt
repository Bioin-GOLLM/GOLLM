BACKGROUND: The chromosome 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome is a novel genomic 
disorder that has originally been identified using high resolution genome 
analyses in patients with unexplained mental retardation.
AIM: We report the molecular and/or clinical characterisation of 22 individuals 
with the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome.
RESULTS: We estimate the prevalence of the syndrome to be 1 in 16,000 and show 
that it is highly underdiagnosed. Extensive clinical examination reveals that 
developmental delay, hypotonia, facial dysmorphisms including a long face, a 
tubular or pear-shaped nose and a bulbous nasal tip, and a friendly/amiable 
behaviour are the most characteristic features. Other clinically important 
features include epilepsy, heart defects and kidney/urologic anomalies. Using 
high resolution oligonucleotide arrays we narrow the 17q21.31 critical region to 
a 424 kb genomic segment (chr17: 41046729-41470954, hg17) encompassing at least 
six genes, among which is the gene encoding microtubule associated protein tau 
(MAPT). Mutation screening of MAPT in 122 individuals with a phenotype 
suggestive of 17q21.31 deletion carriers, but who do not carry the recurrent 
deletion, failed to identify any disease associated variants. In five deletion 
carriers we identify a <500 bp rearrangement hotspot at the proximal breakpoint 
contained within an L2 LINE motif and show that in every case examined the 
parent originating the deletion carries a common 900 kb 17q21.31 inversion 
polymorphism, indicating that this inversion is a necessary factor for deletion 
to occur (p<10(-5)).
CONCLUSION: Our data establish the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome as a 
clinically and molecularly well recognisable genomic disorder.
