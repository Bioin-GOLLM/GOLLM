INTRODUCTION: Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are common in cirrhosis with 
antibiotics frequently used to prevent infections, but their efficacy for this 
role is unknown. To investigate this, we used Albumin to Prevent Infection in 
Chronic Liver Failure (ATTIRE) data to evaluate whether antibiotic use in 
patients without infection prevented HAI.
METHODS: In ATTIRE patients without infection at baseline grouped by antibiotic 
prescription or not, we studied HAI during trial treatment period and mortality, 
with propensity score matching to account for differences in disease severity.
RESULTS: Two hundred three of 408 patients prescribed antibiotics at enrollment 
did not have infection and they were more unwell than noninfected patients not 
given antibiotics. There were no differences in subsequent HAI comparing 
antibiotic treated (39/203, 19.2%) to nonantibiotic treated (73/360, 20.3%; P = 
0.83). Twenty-eight-day mortality was higher in antibiotic-treated patients ( P 
= 0.004) likely reflecting increased disease severity. Matching groups using 
propensity scoring revealed no differences in HAI or mortality. In noninfected 
patients at enrollment treated with/without rifaximin, there were no differences 
in HAI ( P = 0.16) or mortality, confirmed with propensity matching. Patients 
given long-term antibiotic prophylaxis at discharge had no differences in 
6-month mortality compared with nonantibiotic patients, although 
antibiotic-treated patients had more infections at trial entry, with numbers too 
small for matching.
DISCUSSION: Half of antibiotics at study entry were given to patients without an 
infection diagnosis which did not reduce the overall risk of HAI or improve 
mortality. This supports prompt de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotics 
guided by culture sensitivities at 24-48 hours after commencement if no 
infection and the patient is improving.
