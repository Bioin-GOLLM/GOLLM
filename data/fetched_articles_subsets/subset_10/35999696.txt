The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has exacerbated the COVID-19 global health 
crisis. Thus far, all variants carry mutations in the spike glycoprotein, which 
is a critical determinant of viral transmission being responsible for 
attachment, receptor engagement and membrane fusion, and an important target of 
immunity. Variants frequently bear truncations of flexible loops in the 
N-terminal domain (NTD) of spike; the functional importance of these 
modifications has remained poorly characterised. We demonstrate that NTD 
deletions are important for efficient entry by the Alpha and Omicron variants 
and that this correlates with spike stability. Phylogenetic analysis reveals 
extensive NTD loop length polymorphisms across the sarbecoviruses, setting an 
evolutionary precedent for loop remodelling. Guided by these analyses, we 
demonstrate that variations in NTD loop length, alone, are sufficient to 
modulate virus entry. We propose that variations in NTD loop length act to 
fine-tune spike; this may provide a mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 to navigate a 
complex selection landscape encompassing optimisation of essential 
functionality, immune-driven antigenic variation and ongoing adaptation to a new 
host.
