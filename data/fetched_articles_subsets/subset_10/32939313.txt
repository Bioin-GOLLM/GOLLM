The hydrated and anhydrous 1:2 cocrystals of oxyresveratrol 
(4-[(E)-2-(3,5-di-hydroxy-phen-yl)ethen-yl]benzene-1,3-diol; OXY; C14H12O4) and 
proline [(S)-pyrrolidine-2-carb-oxy-lic acid; PRO; C5H9NO2], namely, 
4-[(E)-2-(3,5-di-hydroxy-phen-yl)ethen-yl]benzene-1,3-diol 
bis-[(S)-pyrrolidin-1-ium-2-carboxyl-ate] monohydrate, C14H12O4·2C5H9NO2·H2O, 
and the anhydrous form, C14H12O4·2C5H9NO2, were obtained by crystallization at 
different temperatures. Both of them crystallize with ortho-rhom-bic (P212121) 
symmetry. The structures display N-H⋯O and O-H⋯O hydrogen-bonding inter-actions 
between PRO and PRO, OXY and OXY, and OXY and PRO. In the hydrated cocrystal, 
these types of contacts are also observed between the OXY, PRO and water 
mol-ecules. A combination of these inter-actions leads to a three-dimensional 
supra-molecular assembly in each case. Hirshfeld surfaces were used to gain 
further insight into the inter-molecular inter-actions in the packing, including 
the relative percentage contributions of the significant inter-molecular H⋯H and 
H⋯O/O⋯H contacts.
