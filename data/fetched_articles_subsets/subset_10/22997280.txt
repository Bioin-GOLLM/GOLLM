BACKGROUND: Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a stress-responsive 
cytokine produced in cardiovascular cells under conditions of inflammation and 
oxidative stress, is emerging as an important prognostic marker in individuals 
with and without existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). We therefore examined 
the clinical and genetic correlates of circulating GDF15 concentrations, which 
have not been investigated collectively.
METHODS: Plasma GDF15 concentrations were measured in 2991 participants in the 
Framingham Offspring Study who were free of clinically overt CVD (mean age, 59 
years; 56% women). Clinical correlates of GDF15 were examined in multivariable 
analyses. We then conducted a genomewide association study of the GDF15 
concentration that included participants in the Framingham Offspring Study and 
participants in the PIVUS (Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in 
Uppsala Seniors) study.
RESULTS: GDF15 was positively associated with age, smoking, antihypertensive 
treatment, diabetes, worse kidney function, and use of nonsteroidal 
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but it was negatively associated with total 
cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Clinical correlates accounted for 38% of 
interindividual variation in the circulating GDF15 concentration, whereas 
genetic factors accounted for up to 38% of the residual variability (h(2) = 
0.38; P = 2.5 × 10(-11)). We identified 1 locus of genomewide significance. This 
locus, which is on chromosome 19p13.11 and includes the GDF15 gene, is 
associated with GDF15 concentration (smallest P = 2.74 × 10(-32) for rs888663). 
Conditional analyses revealed 2 independent association signals at this locus 
(rs888663 and rs1054564), which were associated with altered cis gene expression 
in blood cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: In ambulatory individuals, both cardiometabolic risk factors and 
genetic factors play important roles in determining circulating GDF15 
concentrations and contribute similarly to the overall variation.
