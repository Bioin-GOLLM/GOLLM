Recent clinical trials using antibodies with low toxicity and high efficiency 
have raised expectations for the development of next-generation protein 
therapeutics. However, the process of obtaining therapeutic antibodies remains 
time consuming and empirical. This review summarizes recent progresses in the 
field of computer-aided antibody development mainly focusing on antibody 
modeling, which is divided essentially into two parts: (i) modeling the 
antigen-binding site, also called the complementarity determining regions 
(CDRs), and (ii) predicting the relative orientations of the variable heavy 
(V(H)) and light (V(L)) chains. Among the six CDR loops, the greatest challenge 
is predicting the conformation of CDR-H3, which is the most important in antigen 
recognition. Further computational methods could be used in drug development 
based on crystal structures or homology models, including antibody-antigen 
dockings and energy calculations with approximate potential functions. These 
methods should guide experimental studies to improve the affinities and 
physicochemical properties of antibodies. Finally, several successful examples 
of in silico structure-based antibody designs are reviewed. We also briefly 
review structure-based antigen or immunogen design, with application to rational 
vaccine development.
