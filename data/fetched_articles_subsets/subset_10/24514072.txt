The TET (transient electro-thermal) technique is an effective approach developed 
to measure the thermal diffusivity of solid materials, including conductive, 
semi-conductive or nonconductive one-dimensional structures. This technique 
broadens the measurement scope of materials (conductive and nonconductive) and 
improves the accuracy and stability. If the sample (especially biomaterials, 
such as human head hair, spider silk, and silkworm silk) is not conductive, it 
will be coated with a gold layer to make it electronically conductive. The 
effect of parasitic conduction and radiative losses on the thermal diffusivity 
can be subtracted during data processing. Then the real thermal conductivity can 
be calculated with the given value of volume-based specific heat (œÅcp), which 
can be obtained from calibration, noncontact photo-thermal technique or 
measuring the density and specific heat separately. In this work, human head 
hair samples are used to show how to set up the experiment, process the 
experimental data, and subtract the effect of parasitic conduction and radiative 
losses.
