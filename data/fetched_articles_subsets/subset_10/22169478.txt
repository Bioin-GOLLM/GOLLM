A limited set of phosphoinositide membrane lipids regulate diverse cellular 
functions including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. We developed 
two techniques based on rapamycin-induced protein dimerization to rapidly change 
the concentration of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
[PI(4,5)P(2)]. First, using a membrane-recruitable form of PI(4)P 5-kinase, we 
increased PI(4,5)P(2) synthesis from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] 
and found that COS-7, HeLa, and human embryonic kidney 293 cells formed bundles 
of motile actin filaments known as actin comets. In contrast, a second technique 
that increased the concentration of PI(4,5)P(2) without consuming PI(4)P induced 
membrane ruffles. These distinct phenotypes were mediated by dynamin-mediated 
vesicular trafficking and mutually inhibitory crosstalk between the small 
guanosine triphosphatases Rac and RhoA. Our results indicate that the effect of 
PI(4,5)P(2) on actin reorganization depends on the abundance of other 
phosphoinositides, such as PI(4)P. Thus, combinatorial regulation of 
phosphoinositide concentrations may contribute to the diversity of 
phosphoinositide functions.
