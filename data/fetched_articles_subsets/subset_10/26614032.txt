Improved understanding of renal carcinoma disease biology has led to the 
discovery and approval of five novel therapies targeting specific molecules in 
the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) biochemical pathway. Biomarker 
studies attempting to predict response to VEGF-targeted therapies have largely 
focused on circulating proteins, tissue-based molecules, and germline 
polymorphisms. Thus far studies have yielded conflicting results that require 
prospective validation; therefore no definitive biomarker has yet been 
integrated into the clinician's armamentarium. However, early analyses featuring 
genomic biomarkers have generated promising findings. This article provides an 
overview of available biomarkers evaluated with respect to VEGF-targeted 
therapies in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
