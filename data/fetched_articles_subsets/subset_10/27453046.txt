Mammalian cells harbor more than a thousand RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), with 
half of these employing unknown modes of RNA binding. We developed RBDmap to 
determine the RNA-binding sites of native RBPs on a proteome-wide scale. We 
identified 1,174 binding sites within 529 HeLa cell RBPs, discovering numerous 
RNA-binding domains (RBDs). Catalytic centers or protein-protein interaction 
domains are in close relationship with RNA-binding sites, invoking possible 
effector roles of RNA in the control of protein function. Nearly half of the 
RNA-binding sites map to intrinsically disordered regions, uncovering 
unstructured domains as prevalent partners in protein-RNA interactions. 
RNA-binding sites represent hot spots for defined posttranslational 
modifications such as lysine acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation, 
suggesting metabolic and signal-dependent regulation of RBP function. RBDs 
display a high degree of evolutionary conservation and incidence of Mendelian 
mutations, suggestive of important functional roles. RBDmap thus yields profound 
insights into native protein-RNA interactions in living cells.
