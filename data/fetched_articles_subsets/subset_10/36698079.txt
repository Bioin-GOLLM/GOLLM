BACKGROUND: The way how technology addiction relates to psychosis remains 
inconclusive and uncertain. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis of a 
mediating role of depression, anxiety and stress in the association between 
three technology (behavioral) addictions (i.e., Addiction to the Internet, 
smartphones and Facebook) and psychosis proneness as estimated through 
schizotypal traits in emerging adults.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed among non-clinical Tunisian 
university students (67.6% females, mean age of 21.5 ± 2.5 years) using a 
paper-and-pencil self-administered questionnaire.
RESULTS: Results for the Pearson correlation revealed that higher smartphone, 
Internet, and Facebook addictions' scores were significantly and positively 
correlated with each of the depression, anxiety and stress subscores; whereas 
depression (r = 0.474), anxiety (r = 0.499) and stress (r = 0.461) scores were 
positively correlated with higher schizotypal traits. The results of the 
mediation analysis found a significant mediating effect for depressive, anxiety 
and stress symptoms on the cross-sectional relationship between each facet of 
the TA and schizotypal traits.
CONCLUSION: Our findings preliminarily suggest that an addictive use of 
smartphones, Internet and Facebook may act as a stressor that exacerbates 
psychosis proneness directly or indirectly through distress. Although future 
longitudinal research is needed to determine causality, we draw attention to the 
possibility that treating psychological distress may constitute an effective 
target of interventions to prevent psychosis in adolescents with technology 
addictions.
