Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a mild dwarfism caused by missense mutations in 
fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), with the majority of cases 
resulting from a heterozygous p.Asn540Lys gain-of-function mutation. Here, we 
report the generation and characterization of the first mouse model 
(Fgfr3Asn534Lys/+) of HCH to our knowledge. Fgfr3Asn534Lys/+ mice exhibited 
progressive dwarfism and impairment of the synchondroses of the cranial base, 
resulting in defective formation of the foramen magnum. The appendicular and 
axial skeletons were both severely affected and we demonstrated an important 
role of FGFR3 in regulation of cortical and trabecular bone structure. 
Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) of long bones and vertebral bodies was 
decreased, but cortical BMD increased with age in both tibiae and femurs. These 
results demonstrate that bones in Fgfr3Asn534Lys/+ mice, due to FGFR3 
activation, exhibit some characteristics of osteoporosis. The present findings 
emphasize the detrimental effect of gain-of-function mutations in the Fgfr3 gene 
on long bone modeling during both developmental and aging processes, with 
potential implications for the management of elderly patients with 
hypochondroplasia and osteoporosis.
