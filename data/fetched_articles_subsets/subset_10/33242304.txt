Dementia is associated with severe spatial memory deficits which arise from 
dysfunction in hippocampal and parahippocampal circuits. For spatially sensitive 
neurons, such as grid cells, to faithfully represent the environment these 
circuits require precise encoding of direction and velocity information. Here, 
we have probed the firing rate coding properties of neurons in medial entorhinal 
cortex (MEC) in a mouse model of tauopathy. We find that grid cell firing 
patterns are largely absent in rTg4510 mice, while head-direction tuning remains 
largely intact. Conversely, neural representation of running speed information 
was significantly disturbed, with smaller proportions of MEC cells having firing 
rates correlated with locomotion in rTg4510 mice. Additionally, the power of 
local field potential oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency bands, which 
in wild-type mice are tightly linked to running speed, was invariant in rTg4510 
mice during locomotion. These deficits in locomotor speed encoding likely 
severely impact path integration systems in dementia.
