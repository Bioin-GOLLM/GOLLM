One of the greatest challenges of terrestrial vegetation is to acquire water 
through soil-grown roots. Owing to the scarcity of high-quality water in the 
soil and the environment's spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability, 
ranging from extreme flooding to drought, roots have evolutionarily acquired 
tremendous plasticity regarding their geometric arrangement of individual roots 
and their three-dimensional organization within the soil. Water deficiency has 
also become an increasing threat to agriculture and dryland ecosystems due to 
climate change. As a result, roots have become important targets for genetic 
selection and modification in an effort to improve crop resilience under 
water-limiting conditions. This review addresses root plasticity from different 
angles: Their structures and geometry in response to the environment, potential 
genetic control of root traits suitable for water-limiting conditions, and 
contemporary and future studies of the principles underlying root plasticity 
post-Darwin's 'root-brain' hypothesis. Our increasing knowledge of different 
disciplines of plant sciences and agriculture should contribute to a sustainable 
management of natural and agricultural ecosystems for the future of mankind.
