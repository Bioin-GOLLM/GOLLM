OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of MPZ mutations that cause Charcot Marie 
Tooth neuropathy type 1B (CMT1B) and activate the unfolded protein Response 
(UPR).
BACKGROUND: CMT1B is caused by >200 heterozygous mutations in MPZ, the major 
protein in peripheral nerve myelin. Mutations Ser63del MPZ and Arg98Cys MPZ 
cause the mutant protein to be retained in the ER and activate the generally 
adaptive UPR. Treatments that modulate UPR activation have improved cellular and 
rodent models of CMT1B raising the possibility that other MPZ mutations that 
activate the UPR would also respond favorably to similar treatment. The 
prevalence of MPZ mutations that activate the UPR is unknown.
METHODS: We developed a dual luciferase reporter assay of Xbp1 splicing using 
stably transfected RT4 Schwann cells to assay the ability of cDNA constructs 
bearing 46 distinct MPZ mutations to activate the UPR. Constructs also carried 
an HA tag to permit detection of ER retention of mutant proteins. UPR activation 
and ER retention were correlated with clinical phenotypes.
RESULTS: Eighteen mutations demonstrated ER retention and UPR activation to a 
similar degree as Ser63del and Arg98Cys MPZ. Thirty-five of the mutations 
activated the UPR > 1.5 fold compared to that of wild-type MPZ. Correlation was 
high between firefly and Nano-luciferase reporters and between both reporters 
and ER localization. UPR activity did not correlate with clinical onset or 
severity.
CONCLUSION: Many CMT1B causing mutations activate the UPR and may be susceptible 
to therapeutic efforts to facilitate UPR function.
