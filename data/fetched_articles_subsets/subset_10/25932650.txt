Over the past decades, studies have reported that the combinatorial regulation 
of transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) is essential for the 
appropriate execution of biological events and developmental processes. 
Dysregulations of these regulators often cause diseases. However, there are no 
available resources on the regulatory cascades of TFs and miRNAs in the context 
of human diseases. To fulfill this vacancy, we established the TMREC database in 
this study. First, we integrated curated transcriptional and 
post-transcriptional regulations to construct the TF and miRNA regulatory 
network. Next, we identified all linear paths using the Breadth First Search 
traversal method. Finally, we used known disease-related genes and miRNAs to 
measure the strength of association between cascades and diseases. Currently, 
TMREC consists of 74,248 cascades and 25,194 cascade clusters, involving in 412 
TFs, 266 miRNAs and 545 diseases. With the expanding of experimental support 
regulation data, we will regularly update the database. TMREC aims to help 
experimental biologists to comprehensively analyse gene expression regulation, 
to understand the aetiology and to predict novel therapeutic targets. TMREC is
