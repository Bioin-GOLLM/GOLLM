Condensates are biomolecular assemblies that concentrate biomolecules without 
the help of membranes. They are morphologically highly versatile and may emerge 
via distinct mechanisms. Nucleic acids-DNA, RNA and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) play 
special roles in the process of condensate organization. These polymeric 
scaffolds provide multiple specific and nonspecific interactions during 
nucleation and 'development' of macromolecular assemblages. In this review, we 
focus on condensates formed with PAR. We discuss to what extent the literature 
supports the phase separation origin of these structures. Special attention is 
paid to similarities and differences between PAR and RNA in the process of 
dynamic restructuring of condensates during their functioning.
