BACKGROUND: The Advanced Lung Disease Service is a unique, new model of 
integrated respiratory and palliative care, which aims to address the unmet 
needs of patients with advanced, non-malignant, respiratory diseases. This study 
aimed to explore patients' and carers' experiences of integrated palliative care 
and identify valued aspects of care.
METHODS: All current patients of the integrated service and their carers were 
invited to complete a confidential questionnaire by post or with an independent 
researcher.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight responses were received from 64 (80.0%) eligible patients 
and from 24 (60%) eligible carers. Most participants (84, 95.5%) believed the 
integrated service helped them to manage breathlessness and nearly all 
participants (87, 98.9%) reported increased confidence managing symptoms. One 
third of patients (34.4%) had received a nurse-led domiciliary visit, with 
nearly all regarding this as helpful. Most participants believed the integrated 
respiratory and palliative care team listened to them carefully (87, 98.9%) with 
opportunities to express their views (88, 100%). Highly valued aspects of the 
service were continuity of care (82, 93.2%) and long-term care (77, 87.5%). 
Three quarters of participants (66, 75.0%) rated their care as excellent, with 
20.5% rating it as very good. Nearly all (87, 98.9%) participants reported that 
they would recommend the service to others.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients and carers expressed high levels of satisfaction with this 
model of integrated respiratory and palliative care. Continuity of care, high 
quality communication and feeling cared for were greatly valued and highlight 
simple but important aspects of care for all patients.
