BACKGROUND: MAP2K4 is a putative tumor and metastasis suppressor gene frequently 
found to be deleted in various cancer types. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive 
analysis of this gene to assess its involvement in ovarian cancer.
METHODS: We screened for mutations in MAP2K4 using High Resolution Melt analysis 
of 149 primary ovarian tumors and methylation at the promoter using 
Methylation-Specific Single-Stranded Conformation Polymorphism analysis of 39 
tumors. We also considered the clinical impact of changes in MAP2K4 using 
publicly available expression and copy number array data. Finally, we used siRNA 
to measure the effect of reducing MAP2K4 expression in cell lines.
RESULTS: In addition to 4 previously detected homozygous deletions, we 
identified a homozygous 16 bp truncating deletion and a heterozygous 4 bp 
deletion, each in one ovarian tumor. No promoter methylation was detected. The 
frequency of MAP2K4 homozygous inactivation was 5.6% overall, and 9.8% in 
high-grade serous cases. Hemizygous deletion of MAP2K4 was observed in 38% of 
samples. There were significant correlations of copy number and expression in 
three microarray data sets. There was a significant correlation between MAP2K4 
expression and overall survival in one expression array data set, but this was 
not confirmed in an independent set. Treatment of JAM and HOSE6.3 cell lines 
with MAP2K4 siRNA showed some reduction in proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: MAP2K4 is targeted by genetic inactivation in ovarian cancer and 
restricted to high grade serous and endometrioid carcinomas in our cohort.
