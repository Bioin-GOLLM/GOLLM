To efficiently transcribe genes, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) must overcome 
barriers imposed by nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin structure. Many 
genes, including Drosophila melanogaster Hsp70, undergo changes in chromatin 
structure upon activation. To characterize these changes, we mapped the 
nucleosome landscape of Hsp70 after an instantaneous heat shock at high spatial 
and temporal resolution. Surprisingly, we find an initial disruption of 
nucleosomes across the entire gene within 30 s after activation, faster than the 
rate of Pol II transcription, followed by a second further disruption within 2 
min. This initial change occurs independently of Pol II transcription. 
Furthermore, the rapid loss of nucleosomes extends beyond Hsp70 and halts at the 
scs and scs' insulating elements. An RNAi screen of 28 transcription and 
chromatin-related factors reveals that depletion of heat shock factor, GAGA 
Factor, or Poly(ADP)-Ribose Polymerase or its activity abolishes the loss of 
nucleosomes upon Hsp70 activation.
