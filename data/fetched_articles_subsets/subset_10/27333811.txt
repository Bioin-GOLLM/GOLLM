Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILR) are expressed mostly on 
myelomonocytic cells where they are mediators of immunological tolerance. Two 
LILR genes, LILRA3 and LILRA6, exhibit marked copy number variation. We assessed 
the contribution of these genes to atopic dermatitis (AD) by analysing 
transmission in 378 AD families. The data indicated that copies of LILRA6 were 
over-transmitted to affected patients. They are consistent with a contribution 
of LILR genes to AD. They could affect the equilibrium between activating and 
inhibitory signals in the immune response.
