Tandem white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) are promising for the 
lighting and displays field since their current efficiency, external quantum 
efficiency and lifetime can be strikingly enhanced compared with single-unit 
devices. In this invited review, we have firstly described fundamental concepts 
of tandem device architectures and their use in WOLEDs. Then, we have summarized 
the state-of-the-art strategies to achieve high-performance tandem WOLEDs in 
recent years. Specifically, we have highlighted the developments in the four 
types of tandem WOLEDs (i.e., tandem fluorescent WOLEDs, tandem phosphorescent 
WOLEDs, tandem thermally activated delayed fluorescent WOLEDs, and tandem hybrid 
WOLEDs). Furthermore, we have introduced doping-free tandem WOLEDs. In the end, 
we have given an outlook for the future development of tandem WOLEDs.
