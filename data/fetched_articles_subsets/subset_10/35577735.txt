COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for at-risk populations, but the vaccine 
effectiveness in people living with HIV (PLWH) remains incompletely understood. 
Here we demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination was clinically effective among 
PLWH during the outbreak setting with a low endemicity of COVID-19 where 
non-pharmaceutical interventions were strictly implemented.
