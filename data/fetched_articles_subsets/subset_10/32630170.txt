Cellular health is reliant on proteostasis-the maintenance of protein levels 
regulated through multiple pathways modulating protein synthesis, degradation 
and clearance. Loss of proteostasis results in serious disease and is associated 
with aging. One proteinaceous structure underlying the nuclear envelope-the 
nuclear lamina-coordinates essential processes including DNA repair, genome 
organization and epigenetic and transcriptional regulation. Loss of proteostasis 
within the nuclear lamina results in the accumulation of proteins, disrupting 
these essential functions, either via direct interactions of protein aggregates 
within the lamina or by altering systems that maintain lamina structure. Here we 
discuss the links between proteostasis and disease of the nuclear lamina, as 
well as how manipulating specific proteostatic pathways involved in protein 
clearance could improve cellular health and prevent/reverse disease.
