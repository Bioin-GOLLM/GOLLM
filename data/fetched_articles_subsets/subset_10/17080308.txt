A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP309T>G) in the intronic promoter of MDM2 
was recently found to accelerate carcinogenesis in early-onset cancer cases. 
This cancer acceleration presumably was due to increased SP1 binding, resulting 
in enhanced MDM2 transcriptional activation by estrogens. We evaluated MDM2 
SNP309 in 343 familial breast cancer cases with known mutation status for CHEK2 
1100delC, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Cancer acceleration was indeed observed in 
early-onset familial breast cancer cases (diagnosed <or= 51 years), with 16% of 
cases carrying the MDM2 SNP309 GG genotype as compared to 4% of late-onset cases 
(P = 0.029). The cancer acceleration was even more pronounced in the non-mutant 
familial breast cancer cases, with 17% of early-onset cases carrying MDM2 SNP309 
GG as compared to 2% of late-onset cases (n = 214; P = 0.015). There was no 
evidence for an influence of estrogen signaling in the cancer acceleration by 
MDM2 SNP309, as there were no differences in the prevalence of MDM2 SNP309 GG 
among CHEK2 1100delC and BRCA2 mutant cases (with 90% ER-positive cancers) or 
BRCA1 mutant cases (10% ER-positive cancers). Nor did we observe differences in 
MDM2 SNP309 frequencies among 75 familial breast cancer cases of our cohort with 
known ER status. Overall, our data suggest that MDM2 SNP309 accelerates familial 
breast carcinogenesis, but that this acceleration is not influenced by estrogen 
signaling.
