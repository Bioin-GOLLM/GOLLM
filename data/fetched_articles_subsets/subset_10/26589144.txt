BACKGROUND: Morphogenesis is a developmental process in which cells organize 
into shapes and patterns. Complex, non-linear and multi-factorial models with 
images as output are commonly used to study morphogenesis. It is difficult to 
understand the relation between the uncertainty in the input and the output of 
such 'black-box' models, giving rise to the need for sensitivity analysis tools. 
In this paper, we introduce a workflow for a global sensitivity analysis 
approach to study the impact of single parameters and the interactions between 
them on the output of morphogenesis models.
RESULTS: To demonstrate the workflow, we used a published, well-studied model of 
vascular morphogenesis. The parameters of this cellular Potts model (CPM) 
represent cell properties and behaviors that drive the mechanisms of angiogenic 
sprouting. The global sensitivity analysis correctly identified the dominant 
parameters in the model, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, the 
analysis provided information on the relative impact of single parameters and of 
interactions between them. This is very relevant because interactions of 
parameters impede the experimental verification of the predicted effect of 
single parameters. The parameter interactions, although of low impact, provided 
also new insights in the mechanisms of in silico sprouting. Finally, the 
analysis indicated that the model could be reduced by one parameter.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose global sensitivity analysis as an alternative approach 
to study the mechanisms of morphogenesis. Comparison of the ranking of the 
impact of the model parameters to knowledge derived from experimental data and 
from manipulation experiments can help to falsify models and to find the operand 
mechanisms in morphogenesis. The workflow is applicable to all 'black-box' 
models, including high-throughput in vitro models in which output measures are 
affected by a set of experimental perturbations.
