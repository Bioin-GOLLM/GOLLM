Phospholipase C-beta, the principal effector protein regulated by Galphaq, has 
been shown to increase the agonist-stimulated, steady-state GTPase activity of 
Gq in proteoliposomes that contain both heterotrimeric Gq and m1 muscarinic 
receptor. We now use a moderately stable complex of R183C Galphaq bound to GTP 
to show that PLC-beta1 acts directly as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for 
isolated Galphaq in a membrane-free system. PLC-beta1 accelerated the hydrolysis 
of GalphaqR183C.GTP up to 20-fold. The Km was 1.5 nM, which is similar both to 
the EC50 with which R183C and wild type Galphaq activate PLC-beta1 and to the 
EC50 with which PLC-beta1 acts as a Gq GAP in the vesicle-based assay. The 
Galphaq GAP activity of RGS4 can also be quantitated by this assay; it 
accelerated hydrolysis of bound GTP about 100-fold. The Gq GAP activities of 
both PLC-beta1 and RGS4 are blocked by Gbeta gamma subunits, probably by a 
competitive mechanism. These data suggest either that the Gbeta gamma subunits 
are not continuously required for receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange during 
steady-state GTP hydrolysis or that GAPs, either PLC-beta or RGS proteins, can 
substitute for Gbeta gamma in this set of reactions.
