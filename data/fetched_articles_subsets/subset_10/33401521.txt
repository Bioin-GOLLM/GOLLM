In synucleinopathies, while motor symptoms are thought to be attributed to the 
accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein (αSyn) in nigral dopaminergic neurons, it 
remains to be elucidated how cognitive decline arises. Here, we investigated the 
effects of distinct αSyn strains on cognition and the related neuropathology in 
the medial septum/diagonal band (MS/DB), a key region for cognitive processing. 
Bilateral injection of αSyn fibrils into the dorsal striatum potently impaired 
cognition in mice. The cognitive decline was accompanied by accumulation of 
phosphorylated αSyn at Ser129 and reduction of gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA)-ergic but not cholinergic neurons in the MS/DB. Since we have 
demonstrated that fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) is critical for αSyn 
neurotoxicity in nigral dopaminergic neurons, we investigated whether FABP3 also 
participates in αSyn pathology in the MS/DB and cognitive decline. FABP3 was 
highly expressed in GABAergic but rarely in cholinergic neurons in the MS/DB. 
Notably, Fabp3 deletion antagonized the accumulation of phosphorylated αSyn, 
decrease in GABAergic neurons, and cognitive impairment caused by αSyn fibrils. 
Overall, the present study indicates that FABP3 mediates αSyn neurotoxicity in 
septal GABAergic neurons and the resultant cognitive impairment, and that FABP3 
in this subpopulation could be a therapeutic target for dementia in 
synucleinopathies.
