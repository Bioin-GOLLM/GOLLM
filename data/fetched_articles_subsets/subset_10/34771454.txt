Cancer therapy resistance is a persistent clinical challenge. Recently, 
inhibition of the mutagenic translesion synthesis (TLS) protein REV1 was shown 
to enhance tumor cell response to chemotherapy by triggering senescence 
hallmarks. These observations suggest REV1's important role in determining 
cancer cell response to chemotherapy. Whether REV1 inhibition would similarly 
sensitize cancer cells to radiation treatment is unknown. This study reports a 
lack of radiosensitization in response to REV1 inhibition by small molecule 
inhibitors in ionizing radiation-exposed cancer cells. Instead, REV1 inhibition 
unexpectedly triggers autophagy, which is a known biomarker of radioresistance. 
We report a possible role of the REV1 TLS protein in determining cancer 
treatment outcomes depending upon the type of DNA damage inflicted. Furthermore, 
we discover that REV1 inhibition directly triggers autophagy, an uncharacterized 
REV1 phenotype, with a significant bearing on cancer treatment regimens.
