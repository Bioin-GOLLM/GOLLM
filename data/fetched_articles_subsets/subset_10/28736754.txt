PURPOSE: Although aspirin therapy is used widely in older adults for prevention 
of cardiovascular disease, its impact on the incidence, progression and severity 
of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is uncertain. The effect of low-dose 
aspirin on the course of AMD will be evaluated in this clinical trial.
DESIGN: A sub-study of the 'ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly' (ASPREE) 
trial, ASPREE-AMD is a 5-year follow-up double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomized trial of the effect of 100 mg daily aspirin on the course of AMD in 
5000 subjects aged 70 years or older, with normal cognitive function and without 
cardiovascular disease at baseline. Non-mydriatic fundus photography will be 
performed at baseline, 3-year and 5-year follow-up to determine AMD status.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence and progression of AMD. Exploratory 
analyses will determine whether aspirin affects the risk of retinal hemorrhage 
in late AMD, and whether other factors, such as genotype, systemic disease, 
inflammatory biomarkers, influence the effect of aspirin on AMD.
CONCLUSION: The study findings will be of significant clinical and public 
interest due to a potential to identify a possible low cost therapy for 
preventing AMD worldwide and to determine risk/benefit balance of the aspirin 
usage by the AMD-affected elderly. The ASPREE-AMD study provides a unique 
opportunity to determine the effect of aspirin on AMD incidence and progression, 
by adding retinal imaging to an ongoing, large-scale primary prevention 
randomized clinical trial.
