BACKGROUND: Genetics plays an important role in progressive supranuclear palsy 
(PSP) and remains poorly understood. A detailed literature search identified 19 
PSP-associated genes: MAPT, LRRK2, LRP10, DCTN1, GRN, NPC1, PARK, TARDBP, TBK1, 
BSN, GBA, STX6, EIF2AK3, MOBP, DUSP10, SLCO1A2, RUNX2, CXCR4, and APOE. To date, 
genetic studies on PSP have focused on Caucasian population. The gaps in PSP 
genetic study on East Asian populations need to be filled.
METHODS: Exon and flanking regions of the PSP-associated genes were sequenced in 
104 patients with PSP and 488 healthy controls. Common variant-based association 
analysis and gene-based association tests of rare variants were performed using 
PLINK 1.9 and the sequence kernel association test-optimal, respectively. 
Additionally, the association of APOE and MAPT genotypes with PSP was evaluated. 
The above association analyses were repeated among probable PSP patients. 
Finally, PLINK 1.9 was used to test variants associated with the onset age of 
PSP.
RESULTS: A rare non-pathogenic variant of MAPT (c.425C > T,p.A142V) was detected 
in a PSP patient. No common variants were significantly associated with PSP. In 
both the rare-variant and the rare-damaging-variant groups, the combined effect 
for GBA reached statistical significance (p = 1.43 × 10-3, p = 4.98 × 10-4). The 
result between APOE, MAPT genotypes and PSP risk were inconsistent across all 
PSP group and probably PSP group.
CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenic variant in MAPT were uncommon in PSP patients. 
Moreover, GBA gene was likely to increase the risk of PSP, and GBA-associated 
diseases were beyond α-synucleinopathies. The association between APOE, MAPT and 
PSP is still unclear among the non-Caucasian population.
