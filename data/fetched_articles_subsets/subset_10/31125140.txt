OBJECTIVE: Thymidine kinase 2, encoded by the nuclear gene TK2, is required for 
mitochondrial DNA maintenance. Autosomal recessive TK2 mutations cause depletion 
and multiple deletions of mtDNA that manifest predominantly as a myopathy 
usually beginning in childhood and progressing relentlessly. We investigated the 
safety and efficacy of deoxynucleoside monophosphate and deoxynucleoside 
therapies.
METHODS: We administered deoxynucleoside monophosphates and deoxynucleoside to 
16 TK2-deficient patients under a compassionate use program.
RESULTS: In 5 patients with early onset and severe disease, survival and motor 
functions were better than historically untreated patients. In 11 childhood and 
adult onset patients, clinical measures stabilized or improved. Three of 8 
patients who were nonambulatory at baseline gained the ability to walk on 
therapy; 4 of 5 patients who required enteric nutrition were able to discontinue 
feeding tube use; and 1 of 9 patients who required mechanical ventilation became 
able to breathe independently. In motor functional scales, improvements were 
observed in the 6-minute walk test performance in 7 of 8 subjects, Egen 
Klassifikation in 2 of 3, and North Star Ambulatory Assessment in all 5 tested. 
Baseline elevated serum growth differentiation factor 15 levels decreased with 
treatment in all 7 patients tested. A side effect observed in 8 of the 16 
patients was dose-dependent diarrhea, which did not require withdrawal of 
treatment. Among 12 other TK2 patients treated with deoxynucleoside, 2 adults 
developed elevated liver enzymes that normalized following discontinuation of 
therapy.
INTERPRETATION: This open-label study indicates favorable side effect profiles 
and clinical efficacy of deoxynucleoside monophosphate and deoxynucleoside 
therapies for TK2 deficiency. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:293-303.
