High-efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is leading the 
third-generation technology of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). TADF 
emitters are designed and synthesized using inexpensive organic donor and 
acceptor derivatives. TADF emitters are a potential candidate for 
next-generation display technology when compared with metal-complex-based 
phosphorescent dopants. Many studies are being conducted to enhance the external 
quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and photoluminescent quantum yield of green TADF 
devices. Blue TADF reached an EQE of over 35% with the support of suitable donor 
and acceptor moieties based on a suitable molecular design. The efficiencies of 
green TADF emitters can be improved when an appropriate molecular design is 
applied with an efficient device structure. The triazine acceptor has been 
identified as a worthy building block for green TADF emitters. Hence, we present 
here a review of triazine with various donor molecules and their device 
performances. This will help to design more suitable and efficient green TADF 
emitters for OLEDs.
