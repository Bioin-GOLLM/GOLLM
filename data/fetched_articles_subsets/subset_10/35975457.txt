Frizzled (Fzd) proteins are Wnt receptors and play essential roles in 
development, homeostasis, and oncogenesis. How Wnt/Fzd signaling is coupled to 
physiological regulation remains unknown. Cholesterol is reported as a signaling 
molecule regulating morphogen such as Hedgehog signaling. Despite the 
elusiveness of the in-depth mechanism, it is well-established that pancreatic 
cancer specially requires abnormal cholesterol metabolism levels for growth. In 
this study, it is unexpectedly found that among ten Fzds, Fzd5 has a unique 
capacity to bind cholesterol specifically through its conserved extracellular 
linker region. Cholesterol-binding enables Fzd5 palmitoylation, which is 
indispensable for receptor maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane. In 
Wnt-addicted pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), cholesterol stimulates 
tumor growth via Fzd5-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. A natural oxysterol, 
25-hydroxylsterol competes with cholesterol and inhibits Fzd5 maturation and Wnt 
signaling, thereby alleviating PDAC growth. This cholesterol-receptor 
interaction and ensuing receptor lipidation uncover a novel mechanism by which 
Fzd5 acts as a cholesterol sensor and pivotal connection coupling lipid 
metabolism to morphogen signaling. These findings further suggest that 
cholesterol-targeting may provide new therapeutic opportunities for treating 
Wnt-dependent cancers.
