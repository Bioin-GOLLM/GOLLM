BACKGROUND: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the biochemical interactions between 
PPAR-γ, TGF-β1 and ET-1 in vitro.
METHODS: A549 cells were pre-treated with S2505 (10 μM), S2871 (10 μM) 
with/without SB203580 (10 μM) for 60 min following 2 h treatment with 10 ng/mL 
TGF-β1. A549 cells were also transfected with positive or negative PPAR-γ 
plasmids for comparison. RT-PCR, ELISA, western blotting and confocal laser 
scanning microscopy (CLSM) were used to measure the relevant expression of mRNA, 
protein, mediators of pathways and nuclear factor translocation.
RESULTS: SB203580 inhibited TGF-β1 induced ET-1 expression in A549 cells. S2871 
decreased PPAR-γ mRNA and increase TGF-β1-induced ET-1 expression. S2871 
increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Smad2. Cells transfected with PPAR-γ 
negative plasmid increased TGF-β1 induced ET-1 expression, and increased the 
expression of phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-Smad2. S2505 increased PPAR-γ mRNA 
expression, suppressed the increased TGF-β1-induced expression of ET-1. S2505 
inhibited TGF-β1 induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Smad2, also the nuclear 
translocation of Smad2. Cells transfected with PPAR-γ positive plasmid reduced 
TGF-β1-induced ET-1 expression, and inhibited the expression of phospho-p38 MAPK 
and phospho-Smad2.
CONCLUSIONS: TGF-β1 induced release of endothelin-1 is PPAR-γ dependent in 
cultured A549 cells.
