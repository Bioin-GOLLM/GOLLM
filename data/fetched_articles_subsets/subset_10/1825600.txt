The high affinity laminin receptor is differentially expressed in metastasis. We 
now report that there are multiple copies (6 +/- 1) of the laminin receptor gene 
in the murine genome of normal diploid cells as well as in cell lines derived 
from cancer cells. We have analyzed three distinct cDNA clones isolated from an 
Okayama-Berg cDNA library of transformed mouse fibroblasts that may represent 
transcripts of three different laminin receptor genes. Polymorphic changes 
include insertion of bases at the 5' terminus, a base substitution within the 
coding region resulting in an amino acid change from phenylalanine to leucine, a 
base substitution obliterating a polyadenylation signal, as well as changes in 
the length of the 3' untranslated domains. The discovery of multiple transcripts 
of laminin receptor genes suggests that there is a strong selective pressure to 
maintain laminin receptor expression in murine cells.
