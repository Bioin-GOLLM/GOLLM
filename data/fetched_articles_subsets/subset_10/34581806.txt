New enzymes often evolve by duplication and divergence of genes encoding enzymes 
with promiscuous activities that have become important in the face of 
environmental opportunities or challenges. Amplifications that increase the copy 
number of the gene under selection commonly amplify many surrounding genes. 
Extra copies of these coamplified genes must be removed, either during or after 
evolution of a new enzyme. Here we report that amplicon remodeling can begin 
even before mutations occur in the gene under selection. Amplicon remodeling and 
mutations elsewhere in the genome that indirectly increase fitness result in 
complex population dynamics, leading to emergence of clones that have improved 
fitness by different mechanisms. In this work, one of the two most successful 
clones had undergone two episodes of amplicon remodeling, leaving only four 
coamplified genes surrounding the gene under selection. Amplicon remodeling in 
the other clone resulted in removal of 111 genes from the genome, an acceptable 
solution under these selection conditions, but one that would certainly impair 
fitness under other environmental conditions.
