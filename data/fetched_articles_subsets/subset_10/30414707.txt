BACKGROUND: Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS) is a rare genetic disorder 
characterized by cardiovascular anomalies, dysmorphic faces, ectodermal 
abnormalities and developmental delays. Mutations in BRAF and other RAS-MAPK 
pathway-associated genes are commonly identified in patients with CFCS. While 
this molecular pathway is known to be associated with neuro-inflammatory 
conditions, only one case with CFCS has been reported thus far to develop acute 
encephalopathy in childhood.
CASE REPORT: A 3-year-old boy with dysmorphic features and mild psychomotor 
delay developed acute encephalopathy. After a 45-min long, generalized seizure, 
the magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the restricted diffusion signals 
spread to the bilateral subcortical white matters on day 1 of illness. Despite 
the 14 days of intensive care, the acute symptoms of encephalopathy left him 
intractable epilepsy and severe neurocognitive impairments. The whole-exome 
sequencing analysis identified a de novo heterozygous mutation of BRAF 
(NM_004333:p.Thr241Met) in this case.
CONCLUSION: The present case suggests that the hyperactive condition of ERK 
signals might augment the development of acute encephalopathy and 
post-encephalopathic epilepsy in childhood.
