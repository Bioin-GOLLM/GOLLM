OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether the CYP11B2 -344T/C polymorphism is 
correlated with transient ischemic attack (TIA) susceptibility.
METHODS: We recruited 100 TIA patients and 100 control subjects and analyzed the 
CYP11B2 -344T/C polymorphism using restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(PCR-RFLP).
RESULTS: The frequency in TIA patients and controls was 42% compared with 48% 
for TT genotypes, 51% compared with 45% for TC genotypes, and 7% compared with 
7% for CC genotype, respectively. Allele frequencies in TIA patients and 
controls were 67.5% compared with 70.5% for T-allele and 32.5% compared with 
29.5% for C-allele, respectively. No association between the CYP11B2 -344T/C 
polymorphism and TIA was observed in all comparisons.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that there was no association between the CYP11B2 
-344T/C polymorphism and TIA in a Chinese population.
