Methylation of the SKA2 (spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 2) 
gene has recently been identified as a promising biomarker of suicide risk. 
Based on this finding, we examined associations between SKA2 methylation, 
cortical thickness and psychiatric phenotypes linked to suicide in 
trauma-exposed veterans. About 200 trauma-exposed white non-Hispanic veterans of 
the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (91% male) underwent clinical 
assessment and had blood drawn for genotyping and methylation analysis. Of all, 
145 participants also had neuroimaging data available. Based on previous 
research, we examined DNA methylation at the cytosine-guanine locus cg13989295 
as well as DNA methylation adjusted for genotype at the methylation-associated 
single nucleotide polymorphism (rs7208505) in relationship to whole-brain 
cortical thickness, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD) and depression 
symptoms. Whole-brain vertex-wise analyses identified three clusters in 
prefrontal cortex that were associated with genotype-adjusted SKA2 DNA 
methylation (methylation(adj)). Specifically, DNA methylation(adj) was 
associated with bilateral reductions of cortical thickness in frontal pole and 
superior frontal gyrus, and similar effects were found in the right 
orbitofrontal cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus. PTSD symptom severity was 
positively correlated with SKA2 DNA methylation(adj) and negatively correlated 
with cortical thickness in these regions. Mediation analyses showed a 
significant indirect effect of PTSD on cortical thickness via SKA2 methylation 
status. Results suggest that DNA methylation(adj) of SKA2 in blood indexes 
stress-related psychiatric phenotypes and neurobiology, pointing to its 
potential value as a biomarker of stress exposure and susceptibility.
