BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus is a key drug in kidney transplantation with a narrow 
therapeutic index. However, whether tacrolimus exposure variability affects 
clinical outcomes and adverse reactions remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated the factors that influence tacrolimus exposure 
in kidney transplantation recipients and the relationship between tacrolimus 
concentration and clinical outcomes and adverse reactions.
SETTINGS AND METHODS: We examined the effect of tacrolimus concentration on 
clinical outcomes and adverse reactions in 201 kidney transplantation 
recipients, and identified clinical and pharmacogenetic factors that explain 
tacrolimus exposure.
RESULTS: The CYP3A5 genotype was clearly associated with dose-adjusted trough 
blood tacrolimus concentrations (C0/D), whereas no significant difference was 
observed in patients with the CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A4*22, ABCB1, ABCC2, POR*28 or PXR 
alleles. Clinical factors such as red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and albumin 
were the most useful influence factors affecting tacrolimus C0/D. Besides, Wuzhi 
capsule increased tacrolimus C0/D in kidney transplantation recipients. 
Furthermore, higher tacrolimus concentrations were associated with higher 
diarrhea and post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) risk but not with acute 
rejection and chronic allograft kidney dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: Clinical factors, medication, and CYP-enzyme polymorphisms accounted 
for tacrolimus concentration variability in kidney transplantation recipients. 
Furthermore, higher tacrolimus concentrations were associated with higher 
diarrhea and PTDM risk.
