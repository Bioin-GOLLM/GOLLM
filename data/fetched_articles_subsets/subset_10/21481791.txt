Glioblastomas display cellular hierarchies containing tumor-propagating 
glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). STAT3 is a critical signaling node in GSC 
maintenance but molecular mechanisms underlying STAT3 activation in GSCs are 
poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that the bone marrow X-linked (BMX) 
nonreceptor tyrosine kinase activates STAT3 signaling to maintain self-renewal 
and tumorigenic potential of GSCs. BMX is differentially expressed in GSCs 
relative to nonstem cancer cells and neural progenitors. BMX knockdown potently 
inhibited STAT3 activation, expression of GSC transcription factors, and growth 
of GSC-derived intracranial tumors. Constitutively active STAT3 rescued the 
effects of BMX downregulation, supporting that BMX signals through STAT3 in 
GSCs. These data demonstrate that BMX represents a GSC therapeutic target and 
reinforces the importance of STAT3 signaling in stem-like cancer phenotypes.
