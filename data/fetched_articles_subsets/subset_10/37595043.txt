Pseudouridine is enriched in ribosomal, spliceosomal, transfer, and messenger 
RNA and thus integral to the central dogma. The chemical basis for how 
pseudouridine affects the molecular apparatus such as ribosome, however, remains 
elusive owing to the lack of structures without this natural modification. Here, 
we studied the translation of a hypopseudouridylated ribosome initiated by the 
internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements. We analyzed eight cryo-electron 
microscopy structures of the ribosome bound with the Taura syndrome virus IRES 
in multiple functional states. We found widespread loss of 
pseudouridine-mediated interactions through water and long-range base pairings. 
In the presence of the translocase, eukaryotic elongation factor 2, and 
guanosine 5'-triphosphate hydrolysis, the hypopseudouridylated ribosome favors a 
rare unconducive conformation for decoding that is partially recouped in the 
ribosome population that remains modified at the P-site uridine. The structural 
principles learned establish the link between functional defects and 
modification loss and are likely applicable to other pseudouridine-associated 
processes.
