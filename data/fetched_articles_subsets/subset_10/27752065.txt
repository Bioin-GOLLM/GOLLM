The ability to directly enhance electrical excitability of human cells is 
hampered by the lack of methods to efficiently overexpress large mammalian 
voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC). Here we describe the use of small 
prokaryotic sodium channels (BacNav) to create de novo excitable human tissues 
and augment impaired action potential conduction in vitro. Lentiviral 
co-expression of specific BacNav orthologues, an inward-rectifying potassium 
channel, and connexin-43 in primary human fibroblasts from the heart, skin or 
brain yields actively conducting cells with customizable electrophysiological 
phenotypes. Engineered fibroblasts ('E-Fibs') retain stable functional 
properties following extensive subculture or differentiation into myofibroblasts 
and rescue conduction slowing in an in vitro model of cardiac interstitial 
fibrosis. Co-expression of engineered BacNav with endogenous mammalian VGSCs 
enhances action potential conduction and prevents conduction failure during 
depolarization by elevated extracellular K+, decoupling or ischaemia. These 
studies establish the utility of engineered BacNav channels for induction, 
control and recovery of mammalian tissue excitability.
