Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells of the bone marrow. Although 
the prognosis is variable, no curative therapy has been defined. Vaccinia virus 
infects cancer cells and kills such cells in a variety of ways. These include 
direct infection, triggering of immunomediated cell death, and vascular 
collapse. The potential of the vaccinia virus as an anti-tumor therapy has 
attracted the attention of oncologists. Interestingly, our preliminary 
experiments revealed that myeloma cells were particularly susceptible to 
vaccinia virus. To exploit this susceptibility and to render vaccinia more 
myeloma specific, we generated thymidine-kinase-deleted microRNA 
(miRNA)-regulated vaccinia viruses in which the essential viral gene B5R was 
regulated by miRNAs of normal human cells. Of the miRNAs examined, let-7a was 
found to be the most reliable in terms of regulating viral transmission. 
Exposure to unregulated vaccinia virus killed myeloma-transplanted severe 
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice; the animals succumbed to viral toxicity. 
In contrast, the thymidine-kinase-deleted let-7a-regulated virus remained 
localized within myeloma cells, triggering tumor regression and improving 
overall survival. In conclusion, a thymidine-kinase-deleted let-7a-regulated 
vaccinia virus was safe and effective for mice, warranting clinical trials in 
humans.
