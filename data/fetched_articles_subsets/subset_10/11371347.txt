Andersen's syndrome is characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, 
and dysmorphic features. We have mapped an Andersen's locus to chromosome 17q23 
near the inward rectifying potassium channel gene KCNJ2. A missense mutation in 
KCNJ2 (encoding D71V) was identified in the linked family. Eight additional 
mutations were identified in unrelated patients. Expression of two of these 
mutations in Xenopus oocytes revealed loss of function and a dominant negative 
effect in Kir2.1 current as assayed by voltage-clamp. We conclude that mutations 
in Kir2.1 cause Andersen's syndrome. These findings suggest that Kir2.1 plays an 
important role in developmental signaling in addition to its previously 
recognized function in controlling cell excitability in skeletal muscle and 
heart.
