BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have evaluated haptoglobin (Hp) polymers from 
pooled human plasma as a therapeutic protein to attenuate toxic effects of 
cell-free hemoglobin (Hb). Proof of concept studies have demonstrated efficacy 
of Hp in hemolysis associated with transfusion and sickle cell anemia. However, 
phenotype-specific Hp products might be desirable to exploit phenotype specific 
activities of Hp 1-1 versus Hp 2-2, offering opportunities for recombinant 
therapeutics. Prohaptoglobin (proHp) is the primary translation product of the 
Hp mRNA. ProHp is proteolytically cleaved by complement C1r subcomponent-like 
protein (C1r-LP) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Two main allelic Hp variants, HP1 
and HP2 exist. The larger HP2 is considered to be the ancestor variant of all 
human Hp alleles and is characterized by an α2-chain, which contains an extra 
cysteine residue that pairs with additional α-chains generating multimers with 
molecular weights of 200-900 kDa. The two human HP1 alleles (HP1F and HP1S) 
differ by a two-amino-acid substitution polymorphism within the α-chain and are 
derived from HP2 by recurring exon deletions.
RESULTS: In the present study, we describe a process for the production of 
recombinant phenotype specific Hp polymers in mammalian FS293F cells. This 
approach demonstrates that efficient expression of mature and fully functional 
protein products requires co-expression of active C1r-LP. The functional 
characterization of our proteins, which included monomer/polymer distribution, 
binding affinities as well as NO-sparing and antioxidant functions, demonstrated 
that C1r-LP-processed recombinant Hp demonstrates equal protective functions as 
plasma derived Hp in vitro as well as in animal studies.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a recombinant production process for fully functional 
phenotype-specific Hp therapeutics. The proposed process could accelerate the 
development of Hb scavengers to treat patients with cell-free Hb associated 
disease states, such as sickle cell disease and other hemolytic conditions.
