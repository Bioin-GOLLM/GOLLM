The structure of cerium(IV) bis-(phosphite), Ce(HPO3)2, has been solved by 
single-crystal X-ray diffraction and has trigonal (P-3m1) symmetry. The 
cerium(IV) cation exhibits site symmetry -3m. and is octa-hedrally coordinated 
by O atoms of the phosphite ligands (point group symmetry 3m.). The highly 
symmetrical compound has a layered structure parallel to the ab plane, and is 
closely related to zirconium(IV) bis-(phosphite) solved via powder X-ray 
diffraction with trigonal (P-3 symmetry. Structural details of the two compounds 
are comparatively discussed.
