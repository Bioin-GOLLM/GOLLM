BACKGROUND: Due to its excellent physicochemical properties and wide 
applications in consumer goods, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) have 
been increasingly exposed to the environment and the public. However, the health 
effects of oral exposure of TiO2 NPs are still controversial. This study aimed 
to illustrate the hepatotoxicity induced by TiO2 NPs and the underlying 
mechanisms. Rats were administered with TiO2 NPs (29 nm) orally at exposure 
doses of 0, 2, 10, 50 mg/kg daily for 90 days. Changes in the gut microbiota and 
hepatic metabolomics were analyzed to explore the role of the gut-liver axis in 
the hepatotoxicity induced by TiO2 NPs.
RESULTS: TiO2 NPs caused slight hepatotoxicity, including clear mitochondrial 
swelling, after subchronic oral exposure at 50 mg/kg. Liver metabolomics 
analysis showed that 29 metabolites and two metabolic pathways changed 
significantly in exposed rats. Glutamate, glutamine, and glutathione were the 
key metabolites leading the generation of energy-related metabolic disorders and 
imbalance of oxidation/antioxidation. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis showed that 
the diversity of gut microbiota in rats increased in a dose-dependent manner. 
The abundance of Lactobacillus_reuteri increased and the abundance of Romboutsia 
decreased significantly in feces of TiO2 NPs-exposed rats, leading to changes of 
metabolic function of gut microbiota. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) produced by gut 
microbiota increased significantly, which may be a key factor in the subsequent 
liver effects.
CONCLUSIONS: TiO2 NPs could induce slight hepatotoxicity at dose of 50 mg/kg 
after long-term oral exposure. The indirect pathway of the gut-liver axis, 
linking liver metabolism and gut microbiota, played an important role in the 
underlying mechanisms.
