The interactions between programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands hamper 
tumor-specific CD8+ T cell (TCD8) responses, and PD-1-based "checkpoint 
inhibitors" have shown promise in certain cancers, thus revitalizing interest in 
immunotherapy. PD-1-targeted therapies reverse TCD8 exhaustion/anergy. However, 
whether they alter the epitope breadth of TCD8 responses remains unclear. This 
is an important question because subdominant TCD8 are more likely than 
immunodominant clones to escape tolerance mechanisms and may contribute to 
protective anticancer immunity. We have addressed this question in an in vivo 
model of TCD8 responses to well-defined epitopes of a clinically relevant 
oncoprotein, large T Ag. We found that unlike other coinhibitory molecules 
(CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3), PD-1 was highly expressed by subdominant TCD8, which 
correlated with their propensity to favorably respond to PD-1/PD-1 ligand-1 
(PD-L1)-blocking Abs. PD-1 blockade increased the size of subdominant TCD8 
clones at the peak of their primary response, and it also sustained their 
presence, thus giving rise to an enlarged memory pool. The expanded population 
was fully functional as judged by IFN-γ production and MHC class I-restricted 
cytotoxicity. The selective increase in subdominant TCD8 clonal size was due to 
their enhanced survival, not proliferation. Further mechanistic studies 
utilizing peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding 
full-length T Ag or epitope mingenes, and tumor cells expressing T Ag variants 
revealed that anti-PD-1 invigorates subdominant TCD8 responses by relieving 
their lysis-dependent suppression by immunodominant TCD8 To our knowledge, our 
work constitutes the first report that interfering with PD-1 signaling 
potentiates epitope spreading in tumor-specific responses, a finding with clear 
implications for cancer immunotherapy and vaccination.
