PURPOSE: We used a clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) hotspot mutation 
panel to investigate clonal evolution in paired primary and metastatic tumors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 265 primary and metastatic tumor pairs were 
sequenced using a 46-gene cancer mutation panel capable of detecting one or more 
single-nucleotide variants as well as small insertions/deletions. Mutations were 
tabulated together with tumor type and percentage, mutational variant frequency, 
time interval between onset of primary tumor and metastasis, and neoadjuvant 
therapy status.
RESULTS: Of note, 227 of 265 (85.7%) tumor metastasis pairs showed identical 
mutation calls. Of the tumor pairs with identical mutation calls, 160 (60.4%) 
possessed defining somatic mutation signatures and 67 (25.3%) did not exhibit 
any somatic mutations. There were 38 (14.3%) cases that showed at least one 
novel mutation call between the primary and metastasis. Metastases were almost 
two times more likely to show novel mutations (n = 20, 7.5%) than primary tumors 
(n = 12, 4.5%). TP53 was the most common additionally mutated gene in metastatic 
lesions, followed by PIK3CA and SMAD4. PIK3CA mutations were more often 
associated with metastasis in colon carcinoma samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical NGS hotspot panels can be useful in analyzing clonal 
evolution within tumors as well as in determining subclonal mutations that can 
expand in future metastases. PIK3CA, SMAD4, and TP53 are most often involved in 
clonal divergence, providing potential targets that may help guide the clinical 
management of tumor progression or metastases.
