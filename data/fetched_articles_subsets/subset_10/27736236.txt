Depressive symptoms are prevalent and rise during adolescence. The present study 
is a prospective investigation of environmental and genetic factors that 
contribute to the growth in depressive symptoms and the frequency of heightened 
symptoms during adolescence. Participants included 206 mother-father-adolescent 
triads (M age at Time 1 = 13.06 years, SD = .51, 52% female). Harsh parenting 
was observationally assessed during a family conflict paradigm. DNA was 
extracted from saliva samples and genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR and BDNF Val66Met 
polymorphisms. Adolescents provide self-reports of depressive symptoms annually 
across early adolescence. The results reveal Gene × Environment interactions as 
predictors of adolescent depressive symptom trajectories in the context of harsh 
parenting as an environmental risk factor. A BDNF Val66Met × Harsh Parenting 
interaction predicted the rise in depressive symptoms across a 3-year period, 
whereas a 5-HTTLPR × Harsh Parenting interaction predicted greater frequency in 
elevated depressive symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of unique 
genetic and environmental influences in the development and course of heightened 
depressive symptoms during adolescence.
