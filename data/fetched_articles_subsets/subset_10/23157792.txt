Lipoid proteinosis (LP) is a rare disorder characterized by extensive 
hyaline-like deposits on the skin, mucous membranes and various internal organs 
with varying clinical manifestations. The disorder has been recently shown to 
result from loss-of-function mutations in the extracellular matrix protein 1 
gene (ECM1) on 1Q21. The two cases reported here had typical clinical and 
histological features consistent with LP. Direct sequencing of amplified DNA 
from the second patient showed a single nucleotide substitution (C > T) at 
nucleotide 94 within exon 2 of the ECM1 gene, nonsense mutation Q32X. This is 
the second case reported of LP with involvement of exon 2 of ECM1.
