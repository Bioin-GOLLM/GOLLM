RATIONALE: Combined treatment with dabrafenib, a B-RAF inhibitor, and 
trametinib, a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, is an effective option 
for patients with metastatic melanoma. A few cases of acute kidney injury 
associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis and 1 case of nephrotic syndrome 
have been reported in patients on this drug combination; however, progressive 
renal injury has not been reported. In this case study, we report a patient with 
metastatic melanoma who developed glomerular capillary endothelial toxicity and 
progressive glomerular sclerosis during combination therapy.
PATIENT CONCERN: Our patient was an 80-year-old woman with a history of type 2 
diabetes and chronic kidney disease.
DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTION: She was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma and 
commenced combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib.
OUTCOMES: Her renal function progressively deteriorated; by month 20 after 
treatment commencement, her serum creatinine level had increased from 1.59 to 
3.74 mg/dL. The first kidney biopsy revealed marked glomerular and endothelial 
cell damage. Her medication was stopped, but no improvement was evident. At 
5 months after the first biopsy, her serum creatinine level had increased to 
5.46 mg/dL; a second kidney biopsy revealed focal segmental glomerular sclerosis 
and marked tubulointerstitial fibrosis. She was started on hemodialysis.
LESSONS: We describe a patient with a metastatic melanoma who developed 
progressive kidney failure during treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib. The 
most prominent microscopy findings were glomerular endothelial damage in the 
initial kidney biopsy and accelerated glomerular sclerosis and 
tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the follow-up biopsy. We hypothesize that a 
decreased renal reserve and impairment of kidney repair capacity caused by 
inhibition of B-RAF, a downstream mediator of vascular endothelial growth 
factor, may explain the progressive kidney injury.
