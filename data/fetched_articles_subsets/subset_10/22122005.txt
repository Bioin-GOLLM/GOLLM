OBJECTIVE: The present study explored whether d-amino acid oxidase activator 
(DAOA) variants were associated with schizophrenia and whether they could 
predict the clinical outcomes of patients treated with various antipsychotics.
METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-one (221) patients with schizophrenia and 170 
psychiatrically healthy controls were genotyped for seven DAOA single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3916966, rs3916967, rs2391191, rs3916968, rs7139958, 
rs9558571 and rs778293). We also administered baseline and final clinical 
measures, including the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), to 
patients with schizophrenia.
RESULTS: None of the SNPs under investigation was associated with the 
development of schizophrenia. However, the rs7139958 AA and rs9558571 TT as well 
as the rs7139958 A and rs9558571 T genotypes were associated with higher scores 
on the PANSS positive subscale among patients with schizophrenia, possibly 
reflecting their greater susceptibility to the development of more severe 
positive symptoms. No other allele, genotype, or haplotype under investigation 
was significantly associated with any of the clinical parameters, including 
clinical improvement, in patients with schizophrenia.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that rs7139958 and rs9558571 SNPs may be 
associated with more severe baseline positive symptoms in patients with 
schizophrenia. However, further research is needed to draw more definitive 
conclusions given the limitations of our study.
