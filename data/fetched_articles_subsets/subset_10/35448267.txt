In this study, we proposed a genosensor that can qualitatively and 
quantitatively detect genetically modified soybeans using a simple electrode 
with evenly distributed single layer gold nanoparticles. The DNA sensing 
electrode is made by sputtering a gold film on the substrate, and then 
sequentially depositing 1,6-hexanedithiol and gold nanoparticles with sulfur 
groups on the substrate. Then, the complementary to the CaMV 35S promoter (P35S) 
was used as the capture probe. The target DNA directly extracted from the 
genetically modified soybeans rather than the synthesized DNA segments was used 
to construct the detection standard curve. The experimental results showed that 
our genosensor could directly detect genetically modified genes extracted from 
soybeans. We obtained two percentage calibration curves. The calibration curve 
corresponding to the lower percentage range (1-6%) exhibits a sensitivity of 
2.36 Ω/% with R2 = 0.9983, while the calibration curve corresponding to the 
higher percentage range (6-40%) possesses a sensitivity of 0.1 Ω/% with R2 = 
0.9928. The limit of detection would be 1%. The recovery rates for the 4% and 
5.7% GMS DNA were measured to be 104.1% and 102.49% with RSD at 6.24% and 2.54%. 
The gold nanoparticle sensing electrode developed in this research is suitable 
for qualitative and quantitative detection of genetically modified soybeans and 
can be further applied to the detection of other genetically modified crops in 
the future.
