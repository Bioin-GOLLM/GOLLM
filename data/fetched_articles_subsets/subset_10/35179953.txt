Effectiveness of checkpoint immunotherapy in cancer can be undermined by 
immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with an M2 phenotype. 
Reprogramming TAMs toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype is a novel approach to 
induce antitumor immunity. The M2 phenotype is controlled by key transcription 
factors such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), 
which have been "undruggable" selectively in TAMs. We describe an engineered 
exosome therapeutic candidate delivering an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) 
targeting STAT6 (exoASO-STAT6), which selectively silences STAT6 expression in 
TAMs. In syngeneic models of colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, 
exoASO-STAT6 monotherapy results in >90% tumor growth inhibition and 50 to 80% 
complete remissions. Administration of exoASO-STAT6 leads to induction of nitric 
oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), an M1 macrophage marker, resulting in remodeling of the 
tumor microenvironment and generation of a CD8 T cell-mediated adaptive immune 
response. Collectively, exoASO-STAT6 represents the first platform targeting 
transcription factors in TAMs in a highly selective manner.
