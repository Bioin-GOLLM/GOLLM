Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is a risk factor for various cardiovascular 
diseases. However, the mechanism underlying HHcy-aggravated vascular injury 
remains unclear. Here we show that the aggravation of abdominal aortic aneurysm 
by HHcy is abolished in mice with genetic deletion of the angiotensin II type 1 
(AT1) receptor and in mice treated with an AT1 blocker. We find that 
homocysteine directly activates AT1 receptor signalling. Homocysteine displaces 
angiotensin II and limits its binding to AT1 receptor. Bioluminescence resonance 
energy transfer analysis reveals distinct conformational changes of AT1 receptor 
upon binding to angiotensin II and homocysteine. Molecular dynamics and 
site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that homocysteine regulates the 
conformation of the AT1 receptor both orthosterically and allosterically by 
forming a salt bridge and a disulfide bond with its Arg167 and Cys289 residues, 
respectively. Together, these findings suggest that strategies aimed at blocking 
the AT1 receptor may mitigate HHcy-associated aneurysmal vascular injuries.
