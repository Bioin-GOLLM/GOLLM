Invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) causes extraintestinal infections with 
~15% case fatality in many countries. However, the mechanism by which iNTS 
emerged in China remains unaddressed. We conducted clinical investigations of 
iNTS infection with recurrent treatment failure, caused by underreported 
Salmonella enterica serovar Livingstone (SL). Genomic epidemiology demonstrated 
five clades in the SL population and suggested that the international animal 
feed trade was a likely vehicle for their introduction into China, as evidenced 
by multiple independent transmission incidents. Importantly, isolates from 
Clade-5-I-a/b, predominant in China, showed an invasive nature in mice, chicken 
and zebrafish infection models. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
revealed most isolates (> 96%) in China are multidrug-resistant (MDR). Overall, 
we offer exploiting genomics in uncovering international transmission led by the 
animal feed trade and highlight an emerging hypervirulent clade with increased 
resistance to frontline antibiotics.
