OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the role of the tyrosine phosphatase 
PTPN14-which in cancer cells modulates the Hippo pathway by retaining YAP in the 
cytosol-in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Gene/protein expression levels were measured by quantitative PCR and/or 
Western blotting. Gene knockdown in RA FLS was achieved using antisense 
oligonucleotides. The interaction between PTPN14 and YAP was assessed by 
immunoprecipitation. The cellular localisation of YAP and SMAD3 was examined via 
immunofluorescence. SMAD reporter studies were carried out in HEK293T cells. The 
RA FLS/cartilage coimplantation and passive K/BxN models were used to examine 
the role of YAP in arthritis.
RESULTS: RA FLS displayed overexpression of PTPN14 when compared with FLS from 
patients with osteoarthritis (OA). PTPN14 knockdown in RA FLS impaired 
TGFβ-dependent expression of MMP13 and potentiation of TNF signalling. In RA 
FLS, PTPN14 formed a complex with YAP. Expression of PTPN14 or nuclear YAP-but 
not of a non-YAP-interacting PTPN14 mutant-enhanced SMAD reporter activity. YAP 
promoted TGFβ-dependent SMAD3 nuclear localisation in RA FLS. Differences in 
epigenetic marks within Hippo pathway genes, including YAP, were found between 
RA FLS and OA FLS. Inhibition of YAP reduced RA FLS pathogenic behaviour and 
ameliorated arthritis severity.
CONCLUSION: In RA FLS, PTPN14 and YAP promote nuclear localisation of SMAD3. YAP 
enhances a range of RA FLS pathogenic behaviours which, together with epigenetic 
evidence, points to the Hippo pathway as an important regulator of RA FLS 
behaviour.
