BACKGROUND: The rapid advancement of sequencing technologies has made it 
possible to regularly produce millions of high-quality reads from the DNA 
samples in the sequencing laboratories. To this end, the de Bruijn graph is a 
popular data structure in the genome assembly literature for efficient 
representation and processing of data. Due to the number of nodes in a de Bruijn 
graph, the main barrier here is the memory and runtime. Therefore, this area has 
received significant attention in contemporary literature.
RESULTS: In this paper, we present an approach called HaVec that attempts to 
achieve a balance between the memory consumption and the running time. HaVec 
uses a hash table along with an auxiliary vector data structure to store the de 
Bruijn graph thereby improving the total memory usage and the running time. A 
critical and noteworthy feature of HaVec is that it exhibits no false positive 
error.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, the graph construction procedure takes the major share 
of the time involved in an assembly process. HaVec can be seen as a significant 
advancement in this aspect. We anticipate that HaVec will be extremely useful in 
the de Bruijn graph-based genome assembly.
