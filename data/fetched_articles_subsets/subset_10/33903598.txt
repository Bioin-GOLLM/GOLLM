Mass vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine YF-17D is the current way to 
prevent infection with Yellow fever virus (YFV). However, 0.000012-0.00002% of 
vaccinated patients develop post-vaccination neurological syndrome (YEL-AND). 
Understanding the factors responsible for neuroinvasion, neurotropism, and 
neurovirulence of the vaccine is critical for improving its biosafety. The 
YF-FNV vaccine strain, known to be associated with a higher frequency of YEL-AND 
(0.3-0.4%) than YF-17D, is an excellent model to study vaccine 
neuroinvasiveness. We determined that neuroinvasiveness of YF-FNV occured both 
via infection and passage through human brain endothelial cells. Plaque 
purification and next generation sequencing (NGS) identified several 
neuroinvasive variants. Their neuroinvasiveness was not higher than that of 
YF-FNV. However, rebuilding the YF-FNV population diversity from a set of 
isolated YF-FNV-N variants restored the original neuroinvasive phenotype of 
YF-FNV. Therefore, we conclude that viral population diversity is a critical 
factor for YFV vaccine neuroinvasiveness.
