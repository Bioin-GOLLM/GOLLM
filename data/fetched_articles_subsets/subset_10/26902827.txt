Two mutations (C228T and C250T) in the promoter region of the telomerase reverse 
transcriptase (TERT) have recently been described in different types of cancer 
including follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer (TC). In this paper, we 
reviewed the rates of these mutations in different types and subtypes of TC, 
their association with a number of clinical and histopathological features and 
outcome of TC, and their potential diagnostic and prognostic roles in TC. The 
overall rate of these mutations in TC is about 14 % with least prevalence in the 
well-differentiated subtypes of papillary thyroid cancer (10-13 %). Their rates 
increase significantly with increasing aggressiveness of TC reaching about 40 % 
in the undifferentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers. There is also clear 
association with increasing age of patients at the time of diagnosis of TC. The 
evidence is compelling but with some conflicting results for associations 
between TERT promoter mutations and tumor size, extrathyroidal invasion, distant 
metastases, high tumor TNM stage, BRAF (V600E) mutation, recurrence, and 
mortality. A couple of studies reported a potential diagnostic role for TERT 
promoter mutations in thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology of fine needle 
aspiration biopsy. These studies showed 100 % specificity but very low 
sensitivity of 7-10 %. The sensitivity increases significantly when TERT 
promoter mutation testing is combined with other gene mutations, particularly 
BRAF (V600E) and RAS mutations. Although TERT promoter mutations seem to play 
significant roles in the pathogenesis of TC, the mechanisms by which they 
contribute to carcinogenesis remain elusive and future work is needed to fully 
assess the roles, interactions, and impact of these mutations on the 
pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics of TC.
