BYON4228 is a pan-allelic antagonistic SIRPα antibody that potentiates 
destruction of antibody-opsonized tumor cells and lacks binding to SIRPγ on T 
cells.

BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have firmly established the 
CD47-signal-regulatory protein (SIRP)α axis as a myeloid immune checkpoint in 
cancer, and this is corroborated by available evidence from the first clinical 
studies with CD47 blockers. However, CD47 is ubiquitously expressed and mediates 
functional interactions with other ligands as well, and therefore targeting of 
the primarily myeloid cell-restricted inhibitory immunoreceptor SIRPα may 
represent a better strategy.
METHOD: We generated BYON4228, a novel SIRPα-directed antibody. An extensive 
preclinical characterization was performed, including direct comparisons to 
previously reported anti-SIRPα antibodies.
RESULTS: BYON4228 is an antibody directed against SIRPα that recognizes both 
allelic variants of SIRPα in the human population, thereby maximizing its 
potential clinical applicability. Notably, BYON4228 does not recognize the 
closely related T-cell expressed SIRPγ that mediates interactions with CD47 as 
well, which are known to be instrumental in T-cell extravasation and activation. 
BYON4228 binds to the N-terminal Ig-like domain of SIRPα and its epitope largely 
overlaps with the CD47-binding site. BYON4228 blocks binding of CD47 to SIRPα 
and inhibits signaling through the CD47-SIRPα axis. Functional studies show that 
BYON4228 potentiates macrophage-mediated and neutrophil-mediated killing of 
hematologic and solid cancer cells in vitro in the presence of a variety of 
tumor-targeting antibodies, including trastuzumab, rituximab, daratumumab and 
cetuximab. The silenced Fc region of BYON4228 precludes immune cell-mediated 
elimination of SIRPα-positive myeloid cells, implying anticipated preservation 
of myeloid immune effector cells in patients. The unique profile of BYON4228 
clearly distinguishes it from previously reported antibodies representative of 
agents in clinical development, which either lack recognition of one of the two 
SIRPα polymorphic variants (HEFLB), or cross-react with SIRPγ and inhibit 
CD47-SIRPγ interactions (SIRPAB-11-K322A, 1H9), and/or have functional Fc 
regions thereby displaying myeloid cell depletion activity (SIRPAB-11-K322A). In 
vivo, BYON4228 increases the antitumor activity of rituximab in a B-cell Raji 
xenograft model in human SIRPαBIT transgenic mice. Finally, BYON4228 shows a 
favorable safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this defines BYON4228 as a preclinically highly 
differentiating pan-allelic SIRPα antibody without T-cell SIRPγ recognition that 
promotes the destruction of antibody-opsonized cancer cells. Clinical studies 
are planned to start in 2023.
