Broiler ascites syndrome (AS), also called pulmonary artery hypertension, is a 
metabolic disorder that has been observed worldwide in fast-growing broilers. 
Pulmonary arterial remodeling is a key step in the development of AS. The 
precise relationship between mRNA and SNP of the pulmonary artery in regulating 
AS progression remains unclear. In this study, we obtained pulmonary artery 
tissues from broilers with AS to perform pathologic section and pathologic 
anatomic observation. SNP, InDel, and mRNA data analysis were carried out using 
GATK and ANNOVAR software to study the SNP loci of 985 previously reported genes 
(437 upregulated and 458 downregulated). The pathology results showed that there 
was a lot of yellow fluid in the abdominal cavity and pericardium, that the 
ascites cardiac index and hematocrit changed significantly, and that the 
pulmonary artery had remodeled and become thicker in the disease group. 
Myocardial sections showed vacuolar degeneration of myocytes and rupture of 
muscle fibers. In addition, ALDH7A1, IRG1, GGT5, IGSF1, DHX58, USP36, TREML2, 
SPAG1, CD34, and PLEKHA7 were found to be closely associated with the 
pathogenesis of pulmonary artery remodeling in AS progression. Taken together, 
our present study further illuminates the molecular mechanism of pulmonary 
artery remodeling underlying AS progression.
