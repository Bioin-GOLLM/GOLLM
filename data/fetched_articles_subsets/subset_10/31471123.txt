In pursuit of food, hungry animals mobilize significant energy resources and 
overcome exhaustion and fear. How need and motivation control the decision to 
continue or change behavior is not understood. Using a single fly treadmill, we 
show that hungry flies persistently track a food odor and increase their effort 
over repeated trials in the absence of reward suggesting that need dominates 
negative experience. We further show that odor tracking is regulated by two 
mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) connecting the MB to the lateral horn. 
These MBONs, together with dopaminergic neurons and Dop1R2 signaling, control 
behavioral persistence. Conversely, an octopaminergic neuron, VPM4, which 
directly innervates one of the MBONs, acts as a brake on odor tracking by 
connecting feeding and olfaction. Together, our data suggest a function for 
the MB in internal state-dependent expression of behavior that can be suppressed 
by external inputs conveying a competing behavioral drive.
