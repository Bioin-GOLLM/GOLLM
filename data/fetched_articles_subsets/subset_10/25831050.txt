Zipper-interacting protein kinase promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, 
invasion and metastasis through AKT and NF-kB signaling and is associated with 
metastasis and poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients.

Zipper-interacting Protein Kinase (ZIPK) belongs to the death-associated protein 
kinase family. ZIPK has been characterized as a tumor suppressor in various 
tumors, including gastric cancer. On the other hand, ZIPK also promotes cell 
survival. In this study, both in vitro and in vivo assays indicated that ZIPK 
promoted cell growth, proliferation, migration, invasion, tumor formation and 
metastasis in nude mice. ZIPK induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
with increasing expression of β-catenin, mesenchymal markers, Snail and Slug, 
and with decreasing expression of E-cadherin. Furthermore, ZIPK activated the 
AKT/IκB/NF-κB pathway, which can promote EMT and metastasis. Additionally, ZIPK 
expression was detected in human primary gastric cancer and their matched 
metastatic lymph node samples by immunohistochemistry. Increased expression of 
ZIPK in lymph node metastases was significantly associated with stage VI and 
abdominal organ invasion. Survival analysis revealed that patients with 
increased ZIPK expression in metastatic lymph nodes had poor disease-specific 
survival. Taken together, our study reveals that ZIPK is a pro-oncogenic factor, 
which promotes cancer metastasis.
