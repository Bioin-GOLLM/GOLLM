PURPOSE: This study investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with 
PROM1-related inherited retinal diseases (IRDs).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with IRDs who had mutations in PROM1 were identified 
at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital 
in Taiwan. Information on clinical characteristics and best-corrected visual 
acuity was recorded. Color fundus (CF) images, fundus autofluorescence 
photography (FAF), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and 
electroretinograms (ERGs) were analyzed to examine patient phenotypes. PROM1 
variants were detected using whole exome sequencing and verified by Sanger 
sequencing.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients from nine families with PROM1-related IRDs were 
analyzed. Most patients exhibited chorioretinal atrophy in the macular area, 
with or without extramacular involvement on CF. Similarly, hypo-autofluorescence 
confined to the macular area, with or without extramacular involvement, was 
present for most patients on FAF. Furthermore, SD-OCT revealed outer retinal 
tubulations and focal or diffuse retinal thinning. ERGs showed variable 
findings, including maculopathy with normal ERG, subnormal cone response, and 
extinguished rod and cone responses. We detected five variants of the PROM1 
gene, including c.139del, c.794del, c.1238T>A, c.2110C>T, and c.1117C>T.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we evaluated 14 Taiwanese patients with five PROM1 
variants. Additionally, incomplete penetrance of heterozygous PROM1 variants was 
observed. Furthermore, patients with autosomal dominant PROM1 variants had 
lesions in the macular area and the peripheral region of the retina. SD-OCT 
serves as a useful tool for early detection of PROM1-related IRDs, as it 
captures certain signs of such diseases.
