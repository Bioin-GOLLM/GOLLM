Quantum dots (QDs) have attracted increasing interest in bioimaging and sensing. 
Here, we report a biosensor of complex I using ubiquinone-terminated disulphides 
with different alkyl spacers (QnNS, n = 2, 5 and 10) as surface-capping ligands 
to functionalise CdSe/ZnS QDs. The enhancement or quenching of the QD 
bioconjugates fluorescence changes as a function of the redox state of QnNS, 
since QDs are highly sensitive to the electron-transfer processes. The 
bioconjugated QnNS-QDs emission could be modulated by complex I in the presence 
of NADH, which simulates an electron-transfer system part of the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain, providing an in vitro and intracellular complex I sensor. 
Epidemiological studies suggest that Parkinson's patients have the impaired 
activity of complex I in the electron-transfer chain of mitochondria. We have 
demonstrated that the QnNS-QDs system could aid in early stage Parkinson's 
disease diagnosis and progression monitoring by following different complex I 
levels in SH-SY5Y cells.
