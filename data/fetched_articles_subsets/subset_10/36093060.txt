Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy has entered most biological 
laboratories worldwide and its benefit is undisputable. Its application to brain 
imaging, for example in living mice, enables the study of sub-cellular 
structural plasticity and brain function directly in a living mammal. The 
demands of brain imaging on the different super-resolution microscopy techniques 
(STED, RESOLFT, SIM, ISM) and labeling strategies are discussed here as well as 
the challenges of the required cranial window preparation. Applications of 
super-resolution in the anesthetized mouse brain enlighten the stability and 
plasticity of synaptic nanostructures. These studies show the potential of 
in vivo super-resolution imaging and justify its application more widely in vivo 
to investigate the role of nanostructures in memory and learning.
