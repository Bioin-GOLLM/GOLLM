Systemic pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) is a rare, salt-wasting syndrome that is 
caused by inactivating variants in genes encoding epithelial sodium channel 
subunits. Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, increased aldosterone 
and renin levels are expected findings in PHA. Clinical management is 
challenging due to high dose oral replacement therapy. Furthermore, patients 
with systemic PHA require life-long therapy. Here we report a patient with 
systemic PHA due to SCNN1B variant whose hyponatremia and hyperkalemia was 
detected at the 24th hour of life. Hyperkalemia did not improve with 
conventional treatments and dialysis was required. He also developed myocarditis 
and hypertension in follow-up. Challenges for diagnosis and treatment in this 
patient are discussed herein. In addition, published evidence concerning common 
features of patients with SCNN1B variant are reviewed.
