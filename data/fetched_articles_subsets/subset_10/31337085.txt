A high recombination rate and low charge collection are the main limiting 
factors of copper oxides (cupric and cuprous oxide) for the photocatalytic 
degradation of organic pollutants. In this paper, a high performance copper 
oxide photocatalyst was developed by integrating cupric oxide (CuO) and cuprous 
oxide (Cu2O) thin films, which showed superior performance for the 
photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) compared to the control CuO 
and Cu2O photocatalyst. Our results show that a heterojunction photocatalyst of 
CuO-Cu2O thin films could significantly increase the charge collection, reduce 
the recombination rate, and improve the photocatalytic activity.
