Rare hereditary anemias (RHA) represent a group of disorders characterized by 
either impaired production of erythrocytes or decreased survival (i.e., 
hemolysis). In RHA, the regulation of iron metabolism and erythropoiesis is 
often disturbed, leading to iron overload or worsening of chronic anemia due to 
unavailability of iron for erythropoiesis. Whereas iron overload generally is a 
well-recognized complication in patients requiring regular blood transfusions, 
it is also a significant problem in a large proportion of patients with RHA that 
are not transfusion dependent. This indicates that RHA share disease-specific 
defects in erythroid development that are linked to intrinsic defects in iron 
metabolism. In this review, we discuss the key regulators involved in the 
interplay between iron and erythropoiesis and their importance in the spectrum 
of RHA.
