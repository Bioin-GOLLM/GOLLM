Over 40% of proteins in any eukaryotic genome encode intrinsically disordered 
regions (IDRs) that do not adopt defined tertiary structures. Certain IDRs 
perform critical functions, but discovering them is non-trivial as the 
biological context determines their function. We present IDR-Screen, a framework 
to discover functional IDRs in a high-throughput manner by simultaneously 
assaying large numbers of DNA sequences that code for short disordered 
sequences. Functionality-conferring patterns in their protein sequence are 
inferred through statistical learning. Using yeast HSF1 transcription 
factor-based assay, we discovered IDRs that function as transactivation domains 
(TADs) by screening a random sequence library and a designed library consisting 
of variants of 13 diverse TADs. Using machine learning, we find that segments 
devoid of positively charged residues but with redundant short sequence patterns 
of negatively charged and aromatic residues are a generic feature for TAD 
functionality. We anticipate that investigating defined sequence libraries using 
IDR-Screen for specific functions can facilitate discovering novel and 
functional regions of the disordered proteome as well as understand the impact 
of natural and disease variants in disordered segments.
