Despite being in the same pathway, mutations of KRAS and BRAF in colorectal 
carcinomas (CRCs) determine distinct progression courses. ZEB1 induces an 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is associated with worse 
progression in most carcinomas. Using samples from patients with CRC, mouse 
models of KrasG12D and BrafV600E CRC, and a Zeb1-deficient mouse, we show that 
ZEB1 had opposite functions in KRAS- and BRAF-mutant CRCs. In KrasG12D CRCs, 
ZEB1 was correlated with a worse prognosis and a higher number of larger and 
undifferentiated (mesenchymal or EMT-like) tumors. Surprisingly, in BrafV600E 
CRC, ZEB1 was associated with better prognosis; fewer, smaller, and more 
differentiated (reduced EMT) primary tumors; and fewer metastases. ZEB1 was 
positively correlated in KRAS-mutant CRC cells and negatively in BRAF-mutant CRC 
cells with gene signatures for EMT, cell proliferation and survival, and ERK 
signaling. On a mechanistic level, ZEB1 knockdown in KRAS-mutant CRC cells 
increased apoptosis and reduced clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth; 
the reverse occurred in BRAFV600E CRC cells. ZEB1 is associated with better 
prognosis and reduced EMT signature in patients harboring BRAF CRCs. These data 
suggest that ZEB1 can function as a tumor suppressor in BRAF-mutant CRCs, 
highlighting the importance of considering the KRAS/BRAF mutational background 
of CRCs in therapeutic strategies targeting ZEB1/EMT.
