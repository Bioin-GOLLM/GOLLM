BACKGROUND: There is confusion in the literature concerning disorders caused by 
EBP (emopamil-binding protein) mutations in males.
OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical and genetic differences in males affected 
either with Conradi-Hünermann-Happle (CHH) syndrome (X-linked dominant 
chondrodysplasia punctata, CDPX2) or with a nonmosaic, X-linked recessive 
disorder for which we propose the acronymic term MEND syndrome (male EBP 
disorder with neurological defects).
METHODS: We report a 7-year-old boy with a history of transient scaly 
erythematous lesions on his limbs, trunk and scalp soon after birth. DNA was 
isolated from ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid-blood samples of the patient and 
the four coding exons of the EBP gene were amplified by polymerase chain 
reaction. We review all published cases of CHH syndrome in males in the 
literature and elaborate the clinical and genetic differences between CHH 
syndrome in males and MEND syndrome.
RESULTS: We found at position 33 of the EBP gene the variant c.33C>A leading to 
the same nonsense mutation p.Y11X that had previously occurred de novo in a 
female with typical manifestations of CHH syndrome. When the known male cases 
with EBP mutations were reviewed, a striking nosological difference between the 
mosaic and nonmosaic phenotypes was evident. Clear-cut clinical criteria are 
elaborated to distinguish between CHH syndrome in males and MEND syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: Because the clinical outcome and prognosis are different it is 
important to distinguish between males with CHH syndrome that represents a 
mosaic phenotype, and those with MEND syndrome that is a nonmosaic trait.
