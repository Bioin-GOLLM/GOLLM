Fibronectin (FN) is an essential glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix; binds 
integrins, syndecans, collagens, and growth factors; and is assembled by cells 
into complex fibrillar networks. The RGD motif in FN facilitates cell binding- 
and fibrillogenesis through binding to α5β1 and αv-class integrins. However, 
whether RGD is the sole binding site for αv-class integrins is unclear. Most 
notably, substituting aspartate with glutamate (RGE) was shown to eliminate 
integrin binding in vitro, while mouse genetics revealed that FNRGE preserves 
αv-class integrin binding and fibrillogenesis. To address this conflict, we 
employed single-cell force spectroscopy, engineered cells, and RGD 
motif-deficient mice (Fn1ΔRGD/ΔRGD) to search for additional αv-class 
integrin-binding sites. Our results demonstrate that α5β1 and αv-class integrins 
solely recognize the FN-RGD motif and that αv-class, but not α5β1, integrins 
retain FN-RGE binding. Furthermore, Fn1ΔRGD/ΔRGD tissues and cells assemble 
abnormal and dysfunctional FNΔRGD fibrils in a syndecan-dependent manner. Our 
data highlight the central role of FN-RGD and the functionality of FN-RGE for 
αv-class integrins.
