Proper orientation of the mitotic spindle is critical for successful cell 
division in budding yeast. To investigate the mechanism of spindle orientation, 
we used a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tubulin fusion protein to observe 
microtubules in living yeast cells. GFP-tubulin is incorporated into 
microtubules, allowing visualization of both cytoplasmic and spindle 
microtubules, and does not interfere with normal microtubule function. 
Microtubules in yeast cells exhibit dynamic instability, although they grow and 
shrink more slowly than microtubules in animal cells. The dynamic properties of 
yeast microtubules are modulated during the cell cycle. The behavior of 
cytoplasmic microtubules revealed distinct interactions with the cell cortex 
that result in associated spindle movement and orientation. Dynein-mutant cells 
had defects in these cortical interactions, resulting in misoriented spindles. 
In addition, microtubule dynamics were altered in the absence of dynein. These 
results indicate that microtubules and dynein interact to produce dynamic 
cortical interactions, and that these interactions result in the force driving 
spindle orientation.
