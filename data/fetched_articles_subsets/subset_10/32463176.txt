BACKGROUND: About 50 different CALR frameshift mutations have been identified in 
BCR-ABL1 negative MPN, all leading to the development of common new protein C 
terminus. Antibody targeting this terminal epitope can be useful to identify 
this driver mutation using immunohistochemistry.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CALR mutation analysis was carried out in 51 JAK2V617F 
negative cases, PMF (n = 22) and ET (n = 29). PCR followed by fragment analysis 
was performed for molecular detection of CALR mutation. Bone marrow biopsy 
specimens of corresponding patients were subjected to IHC using mutation 
specific antibody CAL2. Staining pattern and intensity were observed. Staining 
of <2% of background nonmegakaryocytic (non- MK) cells were regarded as Pattern 
A, while staining of more than 2% of background nonmegakaryocytic (non-MK) was 
regarded as pattern B.
RESULTS: CALR mutation was noted in 40.9% (9/22) and 41.4% (12/29) of JAK2V617F 
negative PMF and ET, respectively. All CALR mutated cases, irrespective of the 
mutation type, showed a positive IHC staining in the megakaryocytes with 
moderate to bright intensity. All CALR wild-type cases were negative on IHC. 
(Concordance rate- 100%). Pattern A was noted in 40% cases, while pattern B was 
noted in 60% cases. Pattern A staining had significantly higher chances of 
having type 1 mutation as compared to pattern B. In contrast, pattern B had a 
nonsignificant trend toward higher bone marrow cellularity and marrow fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: CAL2 IHC detects all types of CALR mutation. This can act as a 
sensitive, specific, rapid, and cost-effective screening test for CALR mutation 
analysis.
