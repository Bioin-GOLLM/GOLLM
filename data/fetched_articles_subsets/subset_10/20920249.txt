Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is a unique member of the Polo-like family of kinases 
that shares little homology with its siblings and has an essential role in 
centriole duplication. The turn-over of this kinase must be strictly controlled 
to prevent centriole amplification. This is achieved, in part, by an 
autoregulatory mechanism, whereby PLK4 autophosphorylates residues in a PEST 
sequence located carboxy-terminal to its catalytic domain. Phosphorylated PLK4 
is subsequently recognized by the SCF complex, ubiquitinylated and targeted to 
the proteasome for degradation. Recent data have also shown that active PLK4 is 
restricted to the centrosome, a mechanism that could serve to prevent aberrant 
centriole assembly elsewhere in the cell. While significant advances have been 
made in understanding how PLK4 is regulated it is certain that additional 
regulatory mechanisms exist to safeguard the fidelity of centriole duplication. 
Here, we overview past and present data discussing the regulation and functions 
of PLK4.
