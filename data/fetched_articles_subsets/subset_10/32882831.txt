We investigated the influence of selected TP53 SNPs in exon 4 and intron 4 on 
cancer risk, clinicopathological features and expression of TP53 isoforms. The 
intron 4 SNPs were significantly over-represented in cohorts of mixed cancers 
compared to three ethnically matched controls, suggesting they confer increased 
cancer risk. Further analysis showed that heterozygosity at rs1042522(GC) and 
either of the two intronic SNPs rs9895829(TC) and rs2909430(AG) confer a 
2.34-5.35-fold greater risk of developing cancer. These SNP combinations were 
found to be associated with shorter patient survival for glioblastoma and 
prostate cancer. Additionally, these SNPs were associated with tumor-promoting 
inflammation as evidenced by high levels of infiltrating immune cells and 
expression of the Δ133TP53 and TP53β transcripts. We propose that these SNP 
combinations allow increased expression of the Δ133p53 isoforms to promote the 
recruitment of immune cells that create an immunosuppressive environment leading 
to cancer progression.
