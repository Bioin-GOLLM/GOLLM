Interactions between B cells and CD4+ T cells play a central role in the 
development of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Two helper cell subsets, follicular (Tfh) 
and peripheral (Tph) helper T cells, are increased in patients with T1D but 
their role in driving B cell autoimmunity is undefined. We used a personalized 
immune (PI) mouse model to generate human immune systems de novo from 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of patients with T1D or from healthy controls 
(HCs). Both groups developed Tfh and Tph-like cells, and those with T1D-derived 
immune systems demonstrated increased numbers of Tph-like and Tfh cells compared 
to HC-derived PI mice. T1D-derived immune systems included increased proportions 
of unconventional memory CD27-IgD- B cells and reduced proportions of naïve B 
cells compared to HC PI mice, resembling changes reported for patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus. Our findings suggest that T1D HSCs are genetically 
programmed to produce increased proportions of T cells that promote the 
development of unconventional, possibly autoreactive memory B cells. PI mice 
provide an avenue for further understanding of the immune abnormalities that 
drive autoantibody pathogenesis and T1D.
