Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which includes cancers of the 
oral cavity and oropharynx, is a cause of substantial global morbidity and 
mortality. Strategies to reduce disease burden include discovery of novel 
therapies and repurposing of existing drugs. Statins are commonly prescribed for 
lowering circulating cholesterol by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). 
Results from some observational studies suggest that statin use may reduce HNSCC 
risk. We appraised the relationship of genetically-proxied cholesterol-lowering 
drug targets and other circulating lipid traits with oral (OC) and oropharyngeal 
(OPC) cancer risk using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). For the primary 
analysis, germline genetic variants in HMGCR, NPC1L1, CETP, PCSK9 and LDLR were 
used to proxy the effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering 
therapies. In secondary analyses, variants were used to proxy circulating levels 
of other lipid traits in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 
188,578 individuals. Both primary and secondary analyses aimed to estimate the 
downstream causal effect of cholesterol lowering therapies on OC and OPC risk. 
The second sample for MR was taken from a GWAS of 6,034 OC and OPC cases and 
6,585 controls (GAME-ON). Analyses were replicated in UK Biobank, using 839 OC 
and OPC cases and 372,016 controls and the results of the GAME-ON and UK Biobank 
analyses combined in a fixed-effects meta-analysis. We found limited evidence of 
a causal effect of genetically-proxied LDL-C lowering using HMGCR, NPC1L1, CETP 
or other circulating lipid traits on either OC or OPC risk. Genetically-proxied 
PCSK9 inhibition equivalent to a 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C was 
associated with an increased risk of OC and OPC combined (OR 1.8 95%CI 1.2, 2.8, 
p = 9.31 x10-05), with good concordance between GAME-ON and UK Biobank (I2 = 
22%). Effects for PCSK9 appeared stronger in relation to OPC (OR 2.6 95%CI 1.4, 
4.9) than OC (OR 1.4 95%CI 0.8, 2.4). LDLR variants, resulting in 
genetically-proxied reduction in LDL-C equivalent to a 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL), 
reduced the risk of OC and OPC combined (OR 0.7, 95%CI 0.5, 1.0, p = 0.006). A 
series of pleiotropy-robust and outlier detection methods showed that pleiotropy 
did not bias our findings. We found limited evidence for a role of 
cholesterol-lowering in OC and OPC risk, suggesting previous observational 
results may have been confounded. There was some evidence that 
genetically-proxied inhibition of PCSK9 increased risk, while lipid-lowering 
variants in LDLR, reduced risk of combined OC and OPC. This result suggests that 
the mechanisms of action of PCSK9 on OC and OPC risk may be independent of its 
cholesterol lowering effects; however, this was not supported uniformly across 
all sensitivity analyses and further replication of this finding is required.
