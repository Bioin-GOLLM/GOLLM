Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by 
mutations in the gene CTNS. The CTNS gene product, cystinosin, has 367 amino 
acids and seven transmembrane domains and is thought to transport cystine out of 
lysosomes. The most common form of cystinosis, the nephropathic or infantile 
type, is characterized by renal failure at 10 years of age and other systemic 
complications. To date, 32 different CTNS mutations have been described in 
nephropathic cystinosis patients. Intermediate cystinosis, with later onset of 
renal disease, has been associated with three different CTNS mutations. Benign 
or nonnephropathic cystinosis, with symptoms related only to corneal crystals 
and photophobia, has been associated with two other CTNS mutations. In general, 
only certain splicing or missense mutations are associated with milder 
cystinosis phenotypes. Hum Mutat 14:454-458, 1999. Published 1999 Wiley-Liss,
