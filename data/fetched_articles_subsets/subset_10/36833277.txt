Serotonergic and dopaminergic systems are involved in the regulation of mood and 
reactivity to psychological stress. This study explores, in a sample of first 
episode psychosis (FEP) patients, whether more severe depressive symptoms were 
found in those who: (1) experienced a major stressful event in the 6 months 
preceding illness onset; and (2) were homozygous for the COMT Val158 allele or 
carrying the S allele of 5-HTTLPR. A total of 186 FEP patients recruited were 
assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) for depressive 
symptoms. Stressful life events (SLEs) were collected by the List of Events 
Scale. The genotypes of 5-HTTLPR, rs25531, and COMT Val158 Met were performed. 
It has been found that higher levels of depression is associated with the 
presence of SLEs (p = 0.019) and with COMT Val158 allele homozygosity (p = 
0.029), but not with carrying the S allele of 5-HTTLPR. The COMT gene moderates 
the association between depression and SLEs as Val158 allele homozygote patients 
experiencing SLEs had the highest level of depressive symptoms compared to the 
others (p = 0.002). The present study provides initial evidence for an effect of 
the COMT Val158 homozygosity and severe stressful life events on the severity of 
depressive symptoms in first episode psychosis.
