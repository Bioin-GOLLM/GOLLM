Understanding the structural and functional implications of metal ions is of 
pivotal significance to chemical biology. Herein, we report first time the 
evidence of spodium bonds (SpB's, an attractive noncovalent force involving 
elements from group 12 and electron-rich species) in tetrahedral Zn-binding 
sites. Through a combined crystallographic (PDB analysis) and computational (ab 
initio calculations) study, we demonstrate that Zn SpB's are abundant and might 
be involved in protein structure and enzyme inhibition.
