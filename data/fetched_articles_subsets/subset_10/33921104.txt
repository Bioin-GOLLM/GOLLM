Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) was identified for the first time in stray cats in 
2012 in Hong Kong and, since its discovery, it was reported in domestic cats 
worldwide. Although a potential association between FeMV infection and 
tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been suggested, this has not been proven, 
and the subject remains controversial. TIN is the most frequent 
histopathological finding in the context of feline chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
which is one of the major clinical pathologies in feline medicine. FeMV research 
has mainly focused on defining the epidemiology, the role of FeMV in the 
development of CKD, and its in vitro tropism, but the pathogenicity of FeMV is 
still not clear, partly due to its distinctive biological characteristics, as 
well as to a lack of a cell culture system for its rapid isolation. In this 
review, we summarize the current knowledge of FeMV infection, including genetic 
diversity of FeMV strains, epidemiology, pathogenicity, and clinicopathological 
findings observed in naturally infected cats.
