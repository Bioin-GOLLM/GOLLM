Despite scientific evidence originating from two patients published to date that 
CCR5Δ32/Δ32 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can cure human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the knowledge of immunological and 
virological correlates of cure is limited. Here we characterize a case of 
long-term HIV-1 remission of a 53-year-old male who was carefully monitored for 
more than 9 years after allogeneic CCR5Δ32/Δ32 HSCT performed for acute myeloid 
leukemia. Despite sporadic traces of HIV-1 DNA detected by droplet digital PCR 
and in situ hybridization assays in peripheral T cell subsets and tissue-derived 
samples, repeated ex vivo quantitative and in vivo outgrowth assays in humanized 
mice did not reveal replication-competent virus. Low levels of immune activation 
and waning HIV-1-specific humoral and cellular immune responses indicated a lack 
of ongoing antigen production. Four years after analytical treatment 
interruption, the absence of a viral rebound and the lack of immunological 
correlates of HIV-1 antigen persistence are strong evidence for HIV-1 cure after 
CCR5Δ32/Δ32 HSCT.
