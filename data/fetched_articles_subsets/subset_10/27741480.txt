Stress results in a variety of neuroendocrine, immune and behavioral responses 
and represents a risk factor for many disorders. Following exposure to stress, 
glucocorticoids are secreted from the adrenal cortex and act via the 
ligand-activated glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Several polymorphisms of the 
GR-encoding gene NR3C1 have been described and functionally investigated. 
However, the impact of these variants on complex diseases such as 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is still unclear. In this study, 
251 children with ADHD, 19 affected and 35 unaffected siblings, and their 
parents were included in a family-based association study assessing seven common 
variants of NR3C1 (TthIIII_rs10052957; NR3C1-I_rs10482605; 
ER22/23EK_rs6189/rs6190; N363S_rs56149945; BclI_rs41423247; GR-9beta_rs6198). A 
four-marker haplotype (TthIIII-NR3C1-I-ER22/23EK) was nominally associated with 
ADHD. In addition, in index children with ADHD, associations with comorbid 
disorders, inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were explored. N363S 
minor allele carriers were more likely to show comorbid conduct disorder (CD). 
In our study, NR3C1 variants moderately affected ADHD and had a significant 
effect on comorbid CD. Therefore, NR3C1 as an important gene of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis seems to be particularly relevant for the 
pathophysiology of ADHD combined with comorbid CD. For a deeper understanding, 
investigations in larger samples of healthy, ADHD and CD individuals are 
warranted.
