Several genome-wide studies have identified loci associated with reproductive 
traits, such as ages of menarche and menopause, in women of European ancestry. 
In this study, we investigated the relevance of these loci in minority US 
Hispanic women. We utilized data from 3468 women who were genotyped as a part of 
the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource. We replicated 
associations of eight loci (LRP18, LIN28B, CENPW, INHBA, TMEM38B, ZNF483, NFAT5 
and OLFM2) with age at menarche, and of two loci (MCM8 and BRSK1/TMEM150B) with 
age at menopause. The MCM8 locus was also associated with early menopause risk. 
Three loci (CENPW, MCM8 and BRSK1/TMEM150B) were associated with the length of 
reproductive lifespan. We provide evidence that genetic variants influencing 
reproductive traits identified in European populations are also important in 
minority US Hispanic women.
