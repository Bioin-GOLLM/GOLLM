Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an innate immunity receptor predominantly 
expressed on myeloid cells and involved in the development of various diseases, 
many of them with complex genetics. Here we present data on functionality of 
single nucleotide polymorphism rs7873784 located in the 3'-untranslated region 
(3'-UTR) of TLR4 gene and associated with various pathologies involving chronic 
inflammation. We demonstrate that TLR4 3'-UTR strongly enhanced the activity of 
TLR4 promoter in U937 human monocytic cell line while minor rs7873784(C) allele 
created a binding site for transcription factor PU.1 (encoded by SPI1 gene), a 
known regulator of TLR4 expression. Increased binding of PU.1 further augmented 
the TLR4 transcription while PU.1 knockdown or complete disruption of the PU.1 
binding site abrogated the effect. We hypothesize that additional functional 
PU.1 site may increase TLR4 expression in individuals carrying minor C variant 
of rs7873784 and modulate the development of certain pathologies, such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and type-2 diabetes mellitus.
