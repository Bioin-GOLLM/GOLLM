Posterior lamellar transplantation of the eye' s cornea (DSAEK, DMEK) currently 
is the gold standard for treating patients with corneal endothelial cell and 
back surface pathologies resulting in functional impairment. An artificial 
biomimetic graft carrying human corneal endothelium could minimize the 
dependency on human donor corneas giving access to this vision-restoring surgery 
to large numbers of patients, thus reducing current long waiting lists. In this 
study, four groups of electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds were compared: 
polycaprolactone (PCL), PCL/collagen, PCL/gelatin and PCL/chitosan. Each of the 
scaffolds were tissue-engineered with human corneal endothelial cells 
(HCEC-B4G12) and analyzed with regard to their potential application as 
artificial posterior lamellar grafts. Staining with ZO-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase 
antibodies revealed intact cell functionalities. It could be shown, that 
blending leads to decreasing contact angle, whereby a heterogeneous blend 
morphology could be revealed. Scaffold cytocompatibility could be confirmed for 
all groups via live/dead staining, whereby a significant higher cell viability 
could be observed for the collagen and gelatine blended matrices with 97 ± 3% 
and 98 ± 2% living cells respectively. TEM images show the superficial anchoring 
of the HCECs onto the scaffolds. This work emphasizes the benefit of blended PCL 
nanofibrous scaffolds for corneal endothelial keratoplasty.
