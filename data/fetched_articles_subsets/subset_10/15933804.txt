Association between sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the prion-like 
protein gene (PRND) has been reported in the German population. To investigate 
whether the PRND polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk for 
developing sporadic CJD in the Korean population, we compared the genotype and 
allele frequencies of PRND polymorphisms in 110 sporadic CJD patients with those 
in 102 healthy Koreans. Two polymorphisms (P56L, T174 M) in Koreans were found 
in the open reading frame (ORF) of PRND. One heterozygote of P56L was observed 
in normal controls but not in sporadic CJD patients. A strong significant 
difference of PRND genotype frequency at codon 174 was found between the normal 
Korean population and various European populations. In contrast to results in 
the German population, our study did not show a significant difference in PRND 
genotype or allele frequency at codon 174 between sporadic CJD and normal 
controls. This was the first genetic association study of the ORF of PRND in an 
Asian CJD population.
