CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) using dCas9-sgRNA is a powerful tool for the 
exploration and manipulation of gene functions. Here we quantify the reversible 
switching of a central process of the bacterial cell cycle by CRISPRi and an 
antisense RNA mechanism. Reversible induction of filamentous growth in E. coli 
has been recently demonstrated by controlling the expression levels of the 
bacterial cell division proteins FtsZ/FtsA via CRISPRi. If FtsZ falls below a 
critical level, cells cannot divide. However, the cells remain metabolically 
active and continue with DNA replication. We surmised that this makes them 
amenable to an inducible antisense RNA strategy to counteract FtsZ inhibition. 
We show that both static and inducible thresholds can adjust the characteristics 
of the switching process. Combining bulk data with single cell measurements, we 
characterize the efficiency of the switching process. Successful restoration of 
division is found to occur faster in the presence of antisense sgRNAs than upon 
simple termination of CRISPRi induction.
