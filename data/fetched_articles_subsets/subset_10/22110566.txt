The idea that we could build molecular communications systems can be advanced by 
investigating how actual molecules from living organisms function. Information 
theory provides tools for such an investigation. This review describes how we 
can compute the average information in the DNA binding sites of any genetic 
control protein and how this can be extended to analyze its individual sites. A 
formula equivalent to Claude Shannon's channel capacity can be applied to 
molecular systems and used to compute the efficiency of protein binding. This 
efficiency is often 70% and a brief explanation for that is given. The results 
imply that biological systems have evolved to function at channel capacity, 
which means that we should be able to build molecular communications that are 
just as robust as our macroscopic ones.
