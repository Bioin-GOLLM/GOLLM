Merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) has been identified as a target antigen for 
protective immune responses against asexual blood stage malaria, but effective 
vaccines based on MSP1 have not been developed so far. We have modified the 
sequence of Plasmodium yoelii MSP119 (the C-terminal region of the molecule) and 
examined the ability of the variant proteins to bind protective monoclonal 
antibodies and to induce protection by immunization. In parallel, we examined 
the structure of the protein and the consequences of the amino acid changes. 
Naturally occurring sequence polymorphisms reduced the binding of individual 
protective antibodies, indicating that they contribute to immune evasion, but 
immunization with these variant proteins still provided protective immunity. One 
variant that resulted in the localized distortion of a loop close to the 
N-terminus of MSP119 almost completely ablated protection by immunization, 
indicating the importance of this region of MSP119 as a target for protective 
immunity and in vaccine development.
