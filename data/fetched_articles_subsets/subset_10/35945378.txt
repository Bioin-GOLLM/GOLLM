X-linked chronic granulomatous disease is a rare disease caused by mutations in 
the CYBB gene. While more extensive knowledge is available on genetics, 
pathogenesis, and possible therapeutic options, mitochondrial activity and its 
implications on patient monitoring are still not well-characterized. We have 
developed a novel protocol to study mitochondrial activity on whole blood of 
XCGD patients before and after transplantation, as well as on XCGD carriers. 
Here we present results of these analyses and of the restoration of 
mitochondrial activity in hyperinflamed X-linked Chronic Granulomatous Disease 
after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Moreover, we show a strong direct 
correlation between mitochondrial activity, chimerism, and DHR monitored before 
and after transplantation and in XCGD carriers. In conclusion, based on these 
findings, we suggest testing this new ready-to-use marker to better characterize 
patients before and after treatment and to investigate disease expression in 
carriers.
