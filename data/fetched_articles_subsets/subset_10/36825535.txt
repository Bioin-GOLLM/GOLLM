Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood plasma can be bound to nucleosomes that contain 
post-translational modifications representing the epigenetic profile of the cell 
of origin. This includes histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), a 
marker of active transcription. We hypothesised that cell-free chromatin 
immunoprecipitation (cfChIP) of H3K36me3-modified nucleosomes present in blood 
plasma can delineate tumour gene expression levels. H3K36me3 cfChIP followed by 
targeted NGS (cfChIP-seq) was performed on blood plasma samples from 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (NSCLC, n = 8), small-cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) patients (SCLC, n = 4) and healthy controls (n = 4). H3K36me3 
cfChIP-seq demonstrated increased enrichment of mutated alleles compared with 
normal alleles in plasma from patients with known somatic cancer mutations. 
Additionally, genes identified to be differentially expressed in SCLC and NSCLC 
tumours had concordant H3K36me3 cfChIP enrichment profiles in NSCLC 
(sensitivity = 0.80) and SCLC blood plasma (sensitivity = 0.86). Findings here 
expand the utility of cfDNA in liquid biopsies to characterise treatment 
resistance, cancer subtyping and disease progression.
