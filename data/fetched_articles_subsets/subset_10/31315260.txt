Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) is a cell-wall-modifying enzyme 
participating in diverse cell morphogenetic processes and adaptation to stress. 
In this study, 48 XTH genes were identified from two pineapple (Ananas comosus) 
cultivars ('F153' and 'MD2') and designated Ac(F153)XTH1 to -24 and Ac(MD2)XTH1 
to -24 based on their orthology with Arabidopsis thaliana genes. Endoglucanase 
family 16 members were identified in addition to XTHs of glycoside hydrolase 
family 16. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the XTHs into three major groups 
(Group I/II, III and Ancestral Group) and Group III was subdivided into Group 
IIIA and Group IIIB. Similar gene structure and motif number were observed 
within a group. Two highly conserved domains, glycosyl hydrolase family 16 
(GH16-XET) and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase C-terminus (C-XET), were detected 
by multiple sequences alignment of all XTHs. Segmental replication were detected 
in the two cultivars, with only the paralogous pair Ac(F153)XTH7-Ac(F153)XTH18 
presented in 'F153' prior to genomic expansion. Transcriptomic analysis 
indicated that XTHs were involved in the regulation of fruit ripening and 
crassulacean acid metabolism with tissue specificity and quantitative real-time 
PCR analysis suggested that Ac(MD2)XTH18 was involved in root growth. The 
results enhance our understanding of XTHs in the plant kingdom and provide a 
basis for further studies of functional diversity in A. comosus.
