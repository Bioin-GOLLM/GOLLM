Capsid assembly modulators (CAMs) represent a novel class of antiviral agents 
targeting hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid to disrupt the assembly process. NVR 
3-778 is the first CAM to demonstrate antiviral activity in patients infected 
with HBV. However, the relatively low aqueous solubility and moderate activity 
in the human body halted further development of NVR 3-778. To improve the 
anti-HBV activity and the drug-like properties of NVR 3-778, we designed and 
synthesized a series of NVR 3-778 derivatives. Notably, phenylboronic 
acid-bearing compound 7b (EC50 = 0.83 ± 0.33 µM, CC50 = 19.4 ± 5.0 µM) displayed 
comparable anti-HBV activity to NVR 3-778 (EC50 = 0.73 ± 0.20 µM, 
CC50 = 23.4 ± 7.0 µM). Besides, 7b showed improved water solubility 
(328.8 µg/mL, pH 7) compared to NVR 3-778 (35.8 µg/mL, pH 7). Size exclusion 
chromatography (SEC) and quantification of encapsidated viral RNA were used to 
demonstrate that 7b behaves as a class II CAM similar to NVR 3-778. Moreover, 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to rationalize the 
structure-activity relationships (SARs) of these novel derivatives and to 
understand their key interactions with the binding pocket, which provide useful 
indications for guiding the further rational design of more effective anti-HBV 
drugs.
