A series of nine tetrahydroacridine derivatives with iodobenzoic moiety were 
synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against cancer cell 
lines-A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), HT-29 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma) 
and somatic cell line-EA.hy926 (human umbilical vein cell line). All compounds 
displayed high cytotoxicity activity against A549 (IC50 59.12-14.87 µM) and 
HT-29 (IC50 17.32-5.90 µM) cell lines, higher than control agents-etoposide and 
5-fluorouracil. Structure-activity relationship showed that the position of 
iodine in the substituent in the para position and longer linker most strongly 
enhanced the cytotoxic effect. Among derivatives, 1i turned out to be the most 
cytotoxic and displayed IC50 values of 14.87 µM against A549 and 5.90 µM against 
HT-29 cell lines. In hyaluronidase inhibition assay, all compounds presented 
anti-inflammatory activity, however, slightly lower than reference compound. 
ADMET prediction showed that almost all compounds had good pharmacokinetic 
profiles. 1b, 1c and 1f compounds turned out to act against chemoresistance in 
cisplatin-resistant 253J B-V cells. Compounds intercalated into DNA and 
inhibited cell cycle in G0/G1 phase-the strongest inhibition was observed for 1i 
in A549 and 1c in HT-29. Among compounds, the highest apoptotic effect in both 
cell lines was observed after treatment with 1i. Compounds caused DNA damage and 
H2AX phosphorylation, which was detected in A549 and HT-29 cells. All research 
confirmed anticancer properties of novel tetrahydroacridine derivatives and 
explained a few pathways of their mechanism of cytotoxic action.
