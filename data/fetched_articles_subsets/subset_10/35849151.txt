PURPOSE: Modified gemcitabine and S-1 (GS) is an active regimen for patients 
with advanced biliary tract cancer (ABTC) in our previous study. Herein, we 
report the results of a single-arm phase II of nivolumab plus modified GS (NGS) 
as first-line treatment in ABTC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received nivolumab 240 mg and 800 mg/m2 
gemcitabine on day 1 plus daily 80/100/120 mg of S-1 (based on body surface 
area) on days 1 to 10, in a 2-week cycle. The primary endpoint was the objective 
response rate (ORR). The correlation between therapeutic efficacy and genetic 
alterations with signatures identified by targeted next-generation sequencing 
panels was explored.
RESULTS: Between December 2019 and December 2020, 48 eligible patients were 
enrolled. After a median of 17.6 months of follow-up, the ORR was 45.9% [95% 
confidence interval (CI), 31.4%-60.8%]. The median progression-free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 9.1 (95% CI, 5.8-9.6) and 19.2 (95% CI, 
11.6-not reached) months, respectively. All grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse 
events (AE) were less than 10%, except fatigue (14.6%) and skin rash (10.4%). 
Eighteen patients (35.4%) experienced immune-related AEs without 
treatment-related death. High tumor mutational burden (TMB-H; top 20%; ≥7.1 
mut/Mb) only predicted prolonged median PFS but not OS. Up to 28.9% of patients 
who harbored loss-of-function mutations in chromatin remodeling genes 
demonstrated significantly longer median PFS and OS than those without 
alterations.
CONCLUSIONS: NGS is a safe and promising regimen in ABTC. Impaired functions of 
chromatin remodeling genes may be a potential surrogate biomarker with 
predictive value in this study.
