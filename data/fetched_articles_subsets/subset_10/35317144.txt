BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an autoimmune disease characterized 
by sacroiliitis and spondylitis, with a few hematological abnormalities. 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic stem 
cell disorders with frequent autoimmune phenomena. The relationship between AS 
and MDS remains unknown.
CASE SUMMARY: We describe a rare case of concurrent AS and MDS. An 18-year-old 
man with low back pain and anemia was diagnosed with AS; however, the cause of 
anemia could not be determined by the first bone marrow examination. He 
recovered from anemia and the symptoms of AS resolved after treatment with 
etanercept, glucocorticoid, and blood transfusion, but he developed pancytopenia 
with an increased myeloblast count (from 2.5% to 9%). Chromosome analysis 
revealed del(7q) and trisomy 8. Refractory anemia with excess of blasts-1 
(RAEB-1)/MDS was confirmed by repeating the bone marrow examination. He became 
blood transfusion-dependent and received decitabine-based chemotherapy but 
eventually died.
CONCLUSION: We suspect that AS may be an early autoimmune phenomenon related to 
MDS. However, a condition of coexistence cannot be excluded.
