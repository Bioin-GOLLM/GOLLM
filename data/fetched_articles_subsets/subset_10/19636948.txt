Phosphatase of regenerating liver-1 (PRL-1) is a novel target for potentially 
treating cancer metastases. Although its specific biochemical role in these 
processes has yet to be delineated, considerable evidence suggests the 
phosphatase activity of PRL-1 is required for promoting cancer and metastasis. 
PRL-1 belongs to the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) family and functions 
using the CX(5)R consensus active site motif. Like other PTPases, PRL-1 is 
inhibited by oxidation at its active site Cys, however, disulfide bond formation 
occurs unusually readily in wild-type PRL-1. Chemical shift assignments are 
available for oxidized wild type, but numerous, substantial changes are observed 
in the spectra upon reduction. Because the reduced form is active, we sought to 
identify a stable mutant that would resist oxidation and be useful for 
facilitating drug screening and development using NMR-based assays. We present 
here NMR assignments for a full-length, reduced and active form of PRL-1, 
PRL-1-C170S-C171S, that is well suited for this purpose.
