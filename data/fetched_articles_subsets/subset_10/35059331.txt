SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased risk of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE), which is common during active illness but unusual in 
milder cases and after healing. We describe a case of bilateral acute pulmonary 
embolism occurring 3 months after recovery from a paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
infection. The only VTE risk factor demonstrable was a history of previous 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, with laboratory signs of residual low-grade inflammation. 
Clinicians should be aware of VTE as a potential cause of sudden dyspnoea after 
COVID-19 resolution, especially in the presence of persistent systemic 
inflammation.
LEARNING POINTS: Venous thromboembolism may occur after COVID-19, even in milder 
SARS-CoV-2 infections and late after coronavirus clearance.Laboratory signs of 
systemic inflammation are clues for suspecting venous thromboembolism as a cause 
of sudden dyspnoea in patients with low risk scores for pulmonary embolism but 
with previous COVID-19 infection.
