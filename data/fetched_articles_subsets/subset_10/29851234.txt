Mitochondrial unfolded protein response gene Clpp is required to maintain 
ovarian follicular reserve during aging, for oocyte competence, and development 
of pre-implantation embryos.

Caseinolytic peptidase P mediates degradation of unfolded mitochondrial proteins 
and activates mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) to maintain 
protein homeostasis. Clpp-/- female mice generate a lower number of mature 
oocytes and two-cell embryos, and no blastocysts. Clpp-/- oocytes have smaller 
mitochondria, with lower aspect ratio (length/width), and decreased expression 
of genes that promote fusion. A 4-fold increase in atretic follicles at 
3 months, and reduced number of primordial follicles at 6-12 months are observed 
in Clpp-/- ovaries. This is associated with upregulation of p-S6, p-S6K, p-4EBP1 
and p-AKT473, p-mTOR2481 consistent with mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation, 
respectively, and Clpp-/- oocyte competence is partially rescued by mTOR 
inhibitor rapamycin. Our findings demonstrate that CLPP is required for oocyte 
and embryo development and oocyte mitochondrial function and dynamics. Absence 
of CLPP results in mTOR pathway activation, and accelerated depletion of ovarian 
follicular reserve.
