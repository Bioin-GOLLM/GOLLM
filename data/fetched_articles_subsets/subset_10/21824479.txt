Metallophosphoesterase-domain-containing protein 2 (MPPED2) is a highly 
evolutionarily conserved protein with orthologs found from worms to humans. The 
human MPPED2 gene is found in a region of chromosome 11 that is deleted in 
patients with WAGR (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental 
retardation) syndrome, and MPPED2 may function as a tumor suppressor. However, 
the precise cellular roles of MPPED2 are unknown, and its low phosphodiesterase 
activity suggests that substrate hydrolysis may not be its prime function. We 
present here the structures of MPPED2 and two mutants, which show that the poor 
activity of MPPED2 is not only a consequence of the substitution of an 
active-site histidine residue by glycine but also due to binding of AMP or GMP 
to the active site. This feature, enhanced by structural elements of the 
protein, allows MPPED2 to utilize the conserved phosphoprotein-phosphatase-like 
fold in a unique manner, ensuring that its enzymatic activity can be combined 
with a possible role as a scaffolding or adaptor protein.
