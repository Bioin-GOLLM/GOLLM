In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with EGFR 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), this research evaluated the prognostic value 
of CT-based radiomics. A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of 
studies up to April 2023, which included 3111 patients, was conducted. We 
utilized the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool and radiomics quality 
scoring (RQS) system to assess the quality of the included studies. Our analysis 
revealed a pooled hazard ratio for progression-free survival of 2.80 (95% 
confidence interval: 1.87-4.19), suggesting that patients with certain radiomics 
features had a significantly higher risk of disease progression. Additionally, 
we calculated the pooled Harrell's concordance index and area under the curve 
(AUC) values of 0.71 and 0.73, respectively, indicating good predictive 
performance of radiomics. Despite these promising results, further studies with 
consistent and robust protocols are needed to confirm the prognostic role of 
radiomics in NSCLC.
