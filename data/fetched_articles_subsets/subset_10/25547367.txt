We explored the feasibility of applying gene diagnosis in prenatal diagnosis by 
analysis of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 (HPRT1) gene 
mutation in a Chinese Lesch-Nyhan family. A homozygous mutation of p.R170X 
(c.508C＞T) in HPRT1 gene was detected in the proband, and a heterozygous 
mutation of p.R170X was detected in his mother. This mutation failed to be found 
in the 50 unrelated healthy individuals. Prenatal diagnosis indicated that the 
foetus was male and also carried p.R170X (c.508C＞T) mutation, same as the 
proband. Parents of the foetus decided termination of pregnancy, and the result 
of gene analysis for the aborted tissue was consistent with that of prenatal 
diagnosis. We can see that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is caused by non-sense 
mutation p.R170X（c.508C＞T）in HPRT1 gene in this family. Prenatal gene diagnosis 
is a valid strategy to prevent LNS because it can avoid the birth of LNS 
foetuses.
