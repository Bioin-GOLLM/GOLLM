About half of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) do not respond 
to or relapse soon after the standard chemotherapy, indicating a critical need 
to better understand the specific pathways perturbed in DLBCL for developing 
effective therapeutic approaches. Mice deficient in the E3 ubiquitin ligase 
Smurf2 spontaneously develop B-cell lymphomas that resemble human DLBCL with 
molecular features of germinal centre or post-germinal centre B cells. Here we 
show that Smurf2 mediates ubiquitination and degradation of YY1, a key germinal 
centre transcription factor. Smurf2 deficiency enhances YY1-mediated 
transactivation of c-Myc and B-cell proliferation. Furthermore, Smurf2 
expression is significantly decreased in primary human DLBCL samples, and low 
levels of Smurf2 expression correlate with inferior survival in DLBCL patients. 
The Smurf2-YY1-c-Myc regulatory axis represents a novel pathway perturbed in 
DLBCL that suppresses B-cell proliferation and lymphomagenesis, suggesting 
pharmaceutical targeting of Smurf2 as a new therapeutic paradigm for DLBCL.
