As one of crucial epigenetic modification, DNA methylation plays an important 
role during the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In the current study, 
we used a human genome methylation array to detect the aberrant methylation 
genes in CRC. We further identified the hypermethylation of claudin-11 (CLDN11) 
and proved inverse correlation between CLDN11 methylation and its expression in 
CRC. In vitro experiments showed debased migration ability of colonic cancer 
cells in accompany with the converted methylation of CLDN11 after colonic cancer 
cells treated with demethylation agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Besides, our 
results also represented that hypermethylation of CLDN11 was associated with 
increased metastatic potential of CRC and with low progression free survival 
(PFS) of CRC. In conclusion, our findings supported that the hypermethylated 
CLDN11 is associated with metastasis of CRC and prognosis of poor survival of 
CRC.
