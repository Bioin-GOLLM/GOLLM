In the title compound, C(19)H(18)BrNO(5)S, the plane of the phenyl ring forms a 
dihedral angle of 76.99 (6)° with the indole ring system. The Br atom is 
disordered over two positions, with site-occupancy factors of 0.833 (14) and 
0.167 (14). The mol-ecular structure is stabilized by weak intra-molecular C-H⋯O 
inter-actions and the crystal packing is stabilized by weak inter-molecular 
C-H⋯O inter-actions.
