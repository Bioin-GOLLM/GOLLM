Growing evidence is pointing to the importance of multicellular bacterial 
structures in the interaction of pathogenic bacteria with their host. Transition 
from planktonic to host cell-associated multicellular structures is an essential 
infection step that has not been described for the opportunistic human pathogen 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study we show that P. aeruginosa interacts with 
the surface of epithelial cells mainly forming aggregates. Dynamics of aggregate 
formation typically follow a sigmoidal curve. First, a single bacterium attaches 
at cell-cell junctions. This is followed by rapid recruitment of free-swimming 
bacteria and association of bacterial cells resulting in the formation of an 
aggregate on the order of minutes. Aggregates are associated with 
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-enriched host cell membrane 
protrusions. We further show that aggregates can be rapidly internalized into 
epithelial cells. Lyn, a member of the Src family tyrosine kinases previously 
implicated in P. aeruginosa infection, mediates both PIP3-enriched protrusion 
formation and aggregate internalization. Our results establish the first 
framework of principles that define P. aeruginosa transition to multicellular 
structures during interaction with host cells.
