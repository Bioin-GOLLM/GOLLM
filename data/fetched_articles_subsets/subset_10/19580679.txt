BACKGROUND: Neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) is a receptor for vascular endothelial growth 
factor-C (VEGF-C), which is a well-known lymphangiogenic factor and plays an 
important role in lymph node metastasis of various human cancers, including 
breast cancer. Recently, Nrp2 was shown to play a role in cancer by promoting 
tumor cell metastasis. CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) also promotes tumor 
metastasis. In the previous studies, we demonstrated that VEGF-C and cytoplasmic 
CXCR4 expressions were correlated with poorer patient prognosis (BMC Cancer 
2008,8:340; Breast Cancer Res Treat 2005, 91:125-132).
METHODS: The relationship between Nrp2 expression and lymph node metastasis, 
VEGF-C expression, CXCR4 expression, and other established clinicopathological 
variables (these data were cited in our previous papers), including prognosis, 
was analyzed in human breast cancer. Effects of neutralizing anti-Nrp2 antibody 
on CXCR4 expression and chemotaxis were assessed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer 
cells.
RESULTS: Nrp2 expression was observed in 53.1% (60 of 113) of the invasive 
breast carcinomas. Nrp2 expression was significantly correlated with lymph node 
metastasis, VEGF-C expression, and cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression. Survival curves 
determined by the Kaplan-Meier method showed that Nrp2 expression was associated 
with reduced overall survival. In multivariate analysis, Nrp2 expression emerged 
as a significant independent predictor for overall survival. Neutralizing 
anti-Nrp2 antibody blocks cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression and CXCR4-induced 
migration in MDA-MB-231 cells.
CONCLUSION: Nrp2 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis, VEGF-C 
expression, and cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression. Nrp2 expression may serve as a 
significant prognostic factor for long-term survival in breast cancer. Our data 
also showed a role for Nrp2 in regulating cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression in vitro.
