The combined total annual yield of six major crops (maize, rice, wheat, cassava, 
soybean, and potato; Solanum tuberosum L.) amounts to 3.1 billion tons. In 
recent years, staple crops have begun to be used as substitutes for fossil fuel 
and feedstocks. The diversion of crop products to fuels and industrial 
feedstocks has become a concern in many countries because of competition for 
arable lands and increased food prices. These concerns are definitely justified; 
however, if plant biotechnology succeeds in increasing crop yields to double the 
current yields, it will be possible to divert the surplus to purposes other than 
food without detrimental effects. Maize, rice, wheat, and soybean bear their 
sink organs in the aerial parts of the plant, and potato in the underground 
parts. Plants with aerial storage organs cannot accumulate products beyond their 
capacity to support the weight of these organs. In contrast, potato has heavy 
storage organs that are supported by the soil. In this mini-review, we introduce 
strategies of intensifying potato productivity and discuss recent advances in 
this research area.
