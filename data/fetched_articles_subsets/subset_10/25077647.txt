BACKGROUND: Molecular testing for cystic fibrosis mutations is widespread and 
routine in reproductive decision making and diagnosis. Our objective was to 
assess the level of performance of laboratories for this test.
METHODS: The College of American Pathologists administers external proficiency 
testing with multiple DNA samples distributed biannually. RESULTS are analyzed, 
reviewed, and graded by the joint College of American Pathologists/American 
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Biochemical and Molecular Genetics 
Committee. Assessment is based on genotype and associated clinical 
interpretation.
RESULTS: Overall, 357 clinical laboratories participated in the proficiency 
testing survey between 2003 and 2013 (322 in the United States and 35 
international). In 2013, US participants reported performing nearly 120,000 
tests monthly. Analytical sensitivity and specificity of US laboratories were 
98.8% (95% confidence interval: 98.4-99.1%) and 99.6% (95% confidence interval: 
99.4-99.7%), respectively. Analytical sensitivity improved between 2003 and 2008 
(from 97.9 to 99.3%; P = 0.007) and remained steady thereafter. Clinical 
interpretation matched the intended response for 98.8, 86.0, and 91.0% of 
challenges with no, one, or two mutations, respectively. International 
laboratories performed similarly.
DISCUSSION: Laboratory testing for cystic fibrosis in the United States has 
improved since 2003, and these data demonstrate a high level of quality. Neither 
the number of samples tested nor test methodology affected performance.
