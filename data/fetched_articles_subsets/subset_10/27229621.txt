The accumulation of protein aggregates is a common pathological hallmark of many 
neurodegenerative diseases. However, we do not fully understand how aggregates 
are formed or the complex network of chaperones, proteasomes and other 
regulatory factors involved in their clearance. Here, we report a chemically 
controllable fluorescent protein that enables us to rapidly produce small 
aggregates inside living cells on the order of seconds, as well as monitor the 
movement and coalescence of individual aggregates into larger structures. This 
method can be applied to diverse experimental systems, including live animals, 
and may prove valuable for understanding cellular responses and diseases 
associated with protein aggregates.
