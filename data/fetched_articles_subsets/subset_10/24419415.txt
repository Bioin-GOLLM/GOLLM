INTRODUCTION: In non-small-cell lung cancer, an exon 19 deletion and an L858R 
point mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are predictors of 
a response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, it is uncertain whether 
other uncommon EGFR mutations are associated with sensitivity to EGFR-tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors.
METHODS: A post-hoc analysis to assess prognostic factors was performed with the 
use of patients with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion, L858R, G719X, and L861Q) 
who were treated with gefitinib in the NEJ002 study, which compared gefitinib 
with carboplatin-paclitaxel as the first-line therapy.
RESULTS: In the NEJ002 study, 225 patients with EGFR mutations received 
gefitinib at any treatment line. The Cox proportional hazards model indicated 
that performance status, response to chemotherapy, response to gefitinib, and 
mutation types were significant prognostic factors. Overall survival (OS) was 
significantly shorter among patients with uncommon EGFR mutations (G719X or 
L861Q) compared with OS of those with common EGFR mutations (12 versus 28.4 
months; p = 0.002). In the gefitinib group (n = 114), patients with uncommon 
EGFR mutations had a significantly shorter OS (11.9 versus 29.3 months; p < 
0.001). By contrast, OS was similar between patients with uncommon mutations and 
those with common mutations in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group (n = 111; 22.8 
versus 28 months; p = 0.358).
CONCLUSIONS: The post-hoc analyses clearly demonstrated shorter survival for 
gefitinib-treated patients with uncommon EGFR mutations compared with the 
survival of those with common mutations and suggest that the first-line 
chemotherapy may be relatively effective for non-small-cell lung cancer with 
uncommon EGFR mutations.
