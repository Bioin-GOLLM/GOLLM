INTRODUCTION: Immunosuppression, the cornerstone of management of Crohn's 
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (inflammatory bowel diseases; IBD) is 
associated with an increased risk of serious infections that is inadequately 
predicted by clinical risk factors. The role of genetics in determining 
susceptibility to infections is unknown.
METHODS: From a prospective-consented patient registry, we identified IBD 
patients with serious infections requiring hospitalization. Analysis was 
performed to identify IBD-related and non-IBD related immune response loci on 
the Immunochip that were associated with serious infections and a genetic risk 
score (GRS) representing the cumulative burden of the identified single 
nucleotide polymorphisms was calculated. Multivariable logistic regression used 
to identify effect of clinical and genetic factors.
RESULTS: The study included 1333 IBD patients (795 CD, 538 UC) with median 
disease duration of 13 years. A total of 133 patients (10%) had a serious 
infection requiring hospitalization. Patients with infections were more likely 
to have CD and had shorter disease duration. The most common infections were 
skin and soft-tissue, respiratory and urinary tract infections. Eight IBD risk 
loci and two other polymorphisms were significantly associations with serious 
infections. Each one point increase in the infection GRS was associated with a 
50% increase in risk of infections (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.37-1.70) 
(p = 1 × 10-14), confirmed on multivariable analysis. Genetic risk factors 
improved performance of a model predicting infections over clinical covariates 
alone (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic risk factors may predict susceptibility to infections in 
patients with IBD.
