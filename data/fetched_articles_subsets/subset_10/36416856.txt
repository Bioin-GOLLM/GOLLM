How do proteins interact in the cellular environment? Which interactions 
stabilize liquid-liquid phase separated condensates? Are the concepts, which 
have been developed for specific protein complexes also applicable to 
higher-order assemblies? Recent discoveries prompt for a universal framework for 
protein interactions, which can be applied across the scales of protein 
communities. Here, we discuss how our views on protein interactions have evolved 
from rigid structures to conformational ensembles of proteins and discuss the 
open problems, in particular related to biomolecular condensates. Protein 
interactions have evolved to follow changes in the cellular environment, which 
manifests in multiple modes of interactions between the same partners. Such 
cellular context-dependence requires multiplicity of binding modes (MBM) by 
sampling multiple minima of the interaction energy landscape. We demonstrate 
that the energy landscape framework of protein folding can be applied to explain 
this phenomenon, opening a perspective toward a physics-based, universal model 
for cellular protein behaviors.
