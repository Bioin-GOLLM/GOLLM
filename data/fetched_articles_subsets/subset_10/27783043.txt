Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is caused by preterm neonatal lung injury and 
results in oxygen dependency and pulmonary hypertension. Current clinical 
management fails to reduce the incidence of BPD, which calls for novel 
therapies. Fetal rabbits have a lung development that mimics humans and can be 
used as a translational model to test novel treatment options. In preterm 
rabbits, exposure to hyperoxia leads to parenchymal changes, yet vascular damage 
has not been studied in this model. In this study we document the early 
functional and structural changes of the lung vasculature in preterm rabbits 
that are induced by hyperoxia after birth. Pulmonary artery Doppler 
measurements, micro-CT barium angiograms and media thickness of peripheral 
pulmonary arteries were affected after seven days of hyperoxia when compared to 
controls. The parenchyma was also affected both at the functional and structural 
level. Lung function testing showed higher tissue resistance and elastance, with 
a decreased lung compliance and lung capacity. Histologically hyperoxia leads to 
fewer and larger alveoli with thicker walls, less developed distal airways and 
more inflammation than normoxia. In conclusion, we show that the rabbit model 
develops pulmonary hypertension and developmental lung arrest after preterm lung 
injury, which parallel the early changes in human BPD. Thus it enables the 
testing of pharmaceutical agents that target the cardiovascular compartment of 
the lung for further translation towards the clinic.
