L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate is the predominant folate form in human milk but is 
currently not approved as a folate source for infant and follow-on formula. We 
aimed to assess the suitability of L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a folate source 
for infants. Growth and tolerance in healthy term infants fed formulae 
containing equimolar doses of L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (10.4 μg/ 100 ml, n = 
120, intervention group) or folic acid (10.0 μg/ 100 ml, n = 120, control group) 
was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled trial. A 
reference group of breastfed infants was followed. Both formulae were well 
accepted without differences in tolerance or occurrence of adverse events. The 
most common adverse events were common cold, poor weight gain or growth, rash, 
eczema, or dry skin and respiratory tract infection. Weight gain (the primary 
outcome) was equivalent in the two groups (95% CI -2.11; 1.68 g/d). In line with 
this, there was only a small difference in absolute body weight adjusted for 
birth weight and sex at visit 4 (95% CI -235; 135 g). Equivalence was also shown 
for gain in head circumference but not for recumbent length gain and increase in 
calorie intake. Given the nature of the test, this does not indicate an actual 
difference, and adjusted means at visit 4 were not significantly different for 
any of these parameters. Infants receiving formula containing 
L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate had lower mean plasma levels of unmetabolized folic 
acid (intervention: 0.73 nmol/L, control: 1.15 nmol/L, p<0.0001) and higher 
levels of red cell folate (intervention: 907.0 ±192.8 nmol/L, control: 839.4 
±142.4 nmol/L, p = 0.0095). We conclude that L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate is 
suitable for use in infant and follow-on formula, and there are no indications 
of untoward effects. Trial registration: This trial was registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02437721).
