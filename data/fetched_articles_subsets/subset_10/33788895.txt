TcpC is a virulence factor of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC). It was found that 
TIR domain of TcpC impedes TLR signaling by direct association with MyD88. It 
has been a long-standing question whether bacterial pathogens have evolved a 
mechanism to manipulate MyD88 degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here, 
we show that TcpC is a MyD88-targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase. Kidney macrophages 
from mice with pyelonephritis induced by TcpC-secreting UPEC showed 
significantly decreased MyD88 protein levels. Recombinant TcpC (rTcpC) 
dose-dependently inhibited protein but not mRNA levels of MyD88 in macrophages. 
Moreover, rTcpC significantly promoted MyD88 ubiquitination and accumulation in 
proteasomes in macrophages. Cys12 and Trp106 in TcpC are crucial amino acids in 
maintaining its E3 activity. Therefore, TcpC blocks TLR signaling pathway by 
degradation of MyD88 through ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our findings provide 
not only a novel biochemical mechanism underlying TcpC-medicated immune evasion, 
but also the first example that bacterial pathogens inhibit MyD88-mediated 
signaling pathway by virulence factors that function as E3 ubiquitin ligase.
