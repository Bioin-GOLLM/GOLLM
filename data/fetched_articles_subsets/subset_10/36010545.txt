Calsequestrin 1 (CASQ1) and Ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) are two of the main 
players in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. CASQ1-knockout mice and mice 
carrying a mutation in RYR1 (Y522S) linked to human malignant hyperthermia 
susceptibility (MHS) both suffer lethal hypermetabolic episodes when exposed to 
halothane (MHS crises) and to environmental heat (heat stroke, HS). The 
phenotype of Y522S is more severe than that of CASQ1-null mice. As MHS and HS 
are hypermetabolic responses, we studied the metabolism of adult CASQ1-null and 
Y522S mice using wild-type (WT) mice as controls. We found that CASQ1-null and 
Y522S mice have increased food consumption and higher core temperature at rest. 
By indirect calorimetry, we then verified that CASQ1-null and Y522S mice show an 
increased oxygen consumption and a lower respiratory quotient (RQ). The 
accelerated metabolism of CASQ1-null and Y522S mice was also accompanied with a 
reduction in body fat. Moreover, both mouse models displayed increased oxygen 
consumption and a higher core temperature during heat stress. The results 
collected suggest that metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, and body temperature 
at rest, all more elevated in Y522S than in CASQ1-null mice, could possibly be 
used as predictors of the level of susceptibility to hyperthermic crises of mice 
(and possibly humans).
