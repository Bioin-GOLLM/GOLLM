Proliferating cells must cross a point of no return before they replicate their 
DNA and divide. This commitment decision plays a fundamental role in cancer and 
degenerative diseases and has been proposed to be mediated by phosphorylation of 
retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Here, we show that inactivation of the 
anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC(Cdh1)) has the necessary 
characteristics to be the point of no return for cell-cycle entry. Our study 
shows that APC(Cdh1) inactivation is a rapid, bistable switch initiated shortly 
before the start of DNA replication by cyclin E/Cdk2 and made irreversible by 
Emi1. Exposure to stress between Rb phosphorylation and APC(Cdh1) inactivation, 
but not after APC(Cdh1) inactivation, reverted cells to a mitogen-sensitive 
quiescent state, from which they can later re-enter the cell cycle. Thus, 
APC(Cdh1) inactivation is the commitment point when cells lose the ability to 
return to quiescence and decide to progress through the cell cycle.
