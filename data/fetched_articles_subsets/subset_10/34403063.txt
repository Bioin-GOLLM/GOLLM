BACKGROUND: Though BRCA1 mutation is the most susceptible factor of breast 
cancer, its prognostic value is disputable. Here in this study, we use a novel 
method which based on whole-genome analysis to evaluate the chromosome 
instability (CIN) value and identified the potential relationship between CIN 
and prognosis of breast cancer patients with germline-BRCA1 mutation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sanger sequencing or a 98-gene panel sequencing assay was 
used to screen for BRCA1 germline small mutations in 1151 breast cancer patients 
with high-risk factors. MLPA assay was employed to screen BRCA1 large genomic 
rearrangements in familial breast cancer patients with BRCA1 negative for small 
mutations. Thirty-two samples with unique BRCA1 germline mutation patterns were 
further subjected to CIN evaluation by LPWGS (low-pass whole-genome sequencing) 
technology.
RESULTS: Firstly, 113 patients with germline BRCA1 mutations were screened from 
the cohort. Further CIN analysis by the LPWGS assay indicated that CIN was 
independent from the mutation location or type of BRCA1. Patients with high CIN 
status had shorter disease-free survival rates (DFS) (HR = 6.54, 95% CI 
1.30-32.98, P = 0.034). The TP53 copy loss was also characterized by LPWGS 
assay. The rates of TP53 copy loss in CIN high and CIN low groups were 85.71% 
(12/14) and 16.67% (3/18), respectively.
CONCLUSION: CIN-high is a prognostic factor correlated with shorter DFS and was 
independent with the germline BRCA1 mutation pattern. Higher CIN values were 
significantly correlated with TP53 copy loss in breast cancer patients with 
germline BRCA1 mutation. Our results revealed a reliable molecular parameter for 
distinguishing patients with poor prognosis from the BRCA1-mutated breast cancer 
patients.
