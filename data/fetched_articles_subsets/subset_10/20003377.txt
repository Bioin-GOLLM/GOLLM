BACKGROUND: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) epidemic in 
Chongqing, China, is increasing rapidly with the dominant subtype of CRF07_BC 
over the past 3 years. Since human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms have 
shown strong association with susceptibility/resistance to HIV-1 infection from 
individuals with different ethnic backgrounds, a recent investigation on 
frequencies of HLA class I and class II alleles in a Chinese cohort also 
indicated that similar correlation existed in HIV infected individuals from 
several provinces in China, however, such information is unavailable in 
Chongqing, southwest China.
METHODS: In this population-based study, we performed polymerase chain reaction 
analysis with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) for 
intermediate-low-resolution HLA typing in a cohort of 549 HIV-1 infected 
individuals, another 2475 healthy subjects from the Han nationality in 
Chongqing, China, were selected as population control. We compared frequencies 
of HLA-A, B, DRB1 alleles, haplotypes and genotypes between the two groups, and 
analyzed their association with HIV-1 susceptibility or resistance.
RESULTS: The genetic profile of HLA (A, B, DRB1) alleles of HIV-1 infected 
individuals from Chongqing Han of China was obtained. Several alleles of HLA-B 
such as B*46 (P = 0.001, OR = 1.38, 95%CI = 1.13-1.68), B*1501G(B62) (P = 0.013, 
OR = 1.42, 95%CI = 1.08-1.88), B*67 (P = 0.022, OR = 2.76, 95%CI = 1.16-6.57), 
B*37 (P = 0.014, OR = 1.93, 95%CI = 1.14-3.28) and B*52 (P = 0.038, OR = 1.64, 
95%CI = 1.03-2.61) were observed to have association with susceptibility to 
HIV-1 infection in this population. In addition, the haplotype analysis revealed 
that A*11-B*46, A*24-B*54 and A*01-B*37 for 2-locus, and A*11-B*46-DRB1*09, 
A*02-B*46-DRB1*08, A*11-B*4001G-DRB1*15, A*02-B*4001G-DRB1*04, A*11-B*46-DRB1*08 
and A*02-B*4001G-DRB1*12 for 3-locus had significantly overrepresented in HIV-1 
infected individuals, whereas A*11-B*1502G, A*11-B*1502G-DRB1*12 and 
A*33-B*58-DRB1*13 were underrepresented. However, the low-resolution 
homozygosity of HLA-A, B, DRB1 loci and HLA-Bw4/Bw6 genotypes did not differ 
significantly between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: These results may contribute to the database of HLA profiles in 
HIV-1 infected Chinese population, consequently, the association of certain HLA 
alleles with susceptibility or resistance to HIV-1 infection would provide with 
clues in choosing proper preventive strategies against HIV-1 infection and 
developing effective HIV-1 vaccines in Chinese population, especially for those 
in southwest China.
