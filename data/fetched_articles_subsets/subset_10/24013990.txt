OBJECTIVE: To evaluate real-world treatment persistence among patients with type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) initiating treatment with insulin.
METHODS: Patient-level data were pooled from 3 previously published 
observational retrospective studies evaluating patients with T2DM who were 
previously on oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) and initiated with a basal analog 
insulin (insulin glargine or insulin detemir). Treatment persistence was defined 
as remaining on the study drug during the 1-year follow-up period without 
discontinuation or switching after study drug initiation. Analyses were 
conducted to identify baseline factors associated with persistence with insulin 
therapy and to estimate the association between insulin treatment persistence 
and patients' clinical and economic outcomes during the follow-up period.
RESULTS: A total of 4,804 patients with T2DM (insulin glargine: n = 4,172, 
insulin detemir: n = 632) were included. The average insulin persistence rate 
over the 1-year follow-up period was 65.0%. A significantly higher persistence 
rate was associated with older age, initiation with insulin glargine using 
either disposable pens or vial-and-syringe, and with baseline exenatide or 
sitagliptin use. Higher insulin treatment persistence was also associated with 
lower hemoglobin A1c (A1C) at follow-up, a greater reduction in A1C from 
baseline, and lower health care utilization.
CONCLUSION: In real-world settings, treatment persistence among patients with 
T2DM initiating basal insulin is influenced by the type of insulin and patient 
factors. Greater insulin treatment persistence is linked to improved clinical 
outcomes and reduced health care utilization.
