INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening 
disease without effective therapies. PAH is associated with a progressive 
increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and irreversible pulmonary vascular 
remodeling. SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier 1) can bind to target 
proteins and lead to protein SUMOylation, an important post-translational 
modification with a key role in many diseases. However, the contribution of 
SUMO1 to PAH remains to be fully characterized.
METHODS: In this study, we explored the role of SUMO1 in the dedifferentiation 
of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) involved in hypoxia-induced pulmonary 
vascular remodeling and PAH in vivo and in vitro.
RESULTS: In a mouse model of hypoxic PAH, SUMO1 expression was significantly 
increased, which was associated with activation of autophagy (increased LC3b and 
decreased p62), dedifferentiation of pulmonary arterial VSMCs (reduced α-SMA, 
SM22 and SM-MHC), and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Similar results were 
obtained in a MCT-induced PAH model. Overexpression of SUMO1 significantly 
increased VSMCs proliferation, migration, hypoxia-induced VSMCs 
dedifferentiation, and autophagy, but these effects were abolished by inhibition 
of autophagy by 3-MA in aortic VSMCs. Furthermore, SUMO1 knockdown reversed 
hypoxia-induced proliferation and migration of PASMCs. Mechanistically, SUMO1 
promotes Vps34 SUMOylation and the assembly of the Beclin-1-Vps34-Atg14 complex, 
thereby inducing autophagy, whereas Vps34 mutation K840R reduces Vps34 
SUMOylation and inhibits VSMCs dedifferentiation.
DISCUSSION: Our data uncovers an important role of SUMO1 in VSMCs proliferation, 
migration, autophagy, and phenotypic switching (dedifferentiation) involved in 
pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH. Targeting of the SUMO1-Vps34-autophagy 
signaling axis may be exploited to develop therapeutic strategies to treat PAH.
