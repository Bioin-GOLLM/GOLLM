BACKGROUND: Approximately one third of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) cases 
present with diabetic nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of end-stage renal 
disease. Inflammation plays an important role in T2DM disease and DN 
pathogenesis. NLRP3 inflammasomes are complexes that regulate interleukin-1B 
(IL-1B) and IL-18 secretion, both involved in inflammatory responses. Activation 
of NLRP3 is associated with DN onset and progression. Here, we explore whether 
DN is associated with variants in genes encoding key members of the NLRP3 
inflammasome pathway.
METHODS: Using genome-wide association data, we performed a pilot case-control 
association study, between 101 DN-T2DM and 185 non-DN-T2DM cases from the 
Hellenic population across six NLRP3 inflammasome pathway genes.
RESULTS: Three common CARD8 variants confer decreased risk for DN, namely 
rs11665831 (OR = 0.62, p = 0.016), rs11083925 (OR = 0.65, p = 0.021), and 
rs2043211 (OR = 0.66, p = 0.026), independent of sex or co-inheritance with an 
IL-1B variant.
CONCLUSION: CARD8 acts as an NLRP3, NF-κB and caspase-1 inhibitor; perhaps, 
alterations in the cross-talk between CARD8, NF-κB, and NLRP3, which could 
affect the pro-inflammatory environment in T2DM, render diabetic carriers of 
certain common CARD8 variants potentially less likely to develop T2DM-related 
pro-inflammatory responses followed by DN. These preliminary, yet novel, 
observations will require validation in larger cohorts from several ethnic 
groups.
