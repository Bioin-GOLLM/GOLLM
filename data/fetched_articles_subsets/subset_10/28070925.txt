Bio-orthogonal labelling schemes based on inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder 
(IEDDA) cycloaddition have attracted much attention in chemical biology 
recently. The appealing features of this reaction, such as the fast reaction 
kinetics, fully bio-orthogonal nature and high selectivity, have helped chemical 
biologists gain deeper understanding of biochemical processes at the molecular 
level. Listing the components and discussing the possibilities and limitations 
of these reagents, we provide a recent snapshot of the field of IEDDA-based 
biomolecular manipulation with special focus on fluorescent modulation 
approaches through the use of bio-orthogonalized building blocks. At the end, we 
discuss challenges that need to be addressed for further developments in order 
to overcome recent limitations and to enable researchers to answer biomolecular 
questions in more detail.
