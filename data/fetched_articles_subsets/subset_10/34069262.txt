Aberrant glycosylation has long been known to be associated with cancer, since 
it is involved in key mechanisms such as tumour onset, development and 
progression. This review will focus on protein glycosylation studies in cells, 
tissue, urine and serum in the context of prostate cancer. A dedicated section 
will cover the glycoforms of prostate specific antigen, the molecule that, 
despite some important limitations, is routinely tested for helping prostate 
cancer diagnosis. Our aim is to provide readers with an overview of mass 
spectrometry-based glycoproteomics of prostate cancer. From this perspective, 
the first part of this review will illustrate the main strategies for 
glycopeptide enrichment and mass spectrometric analysis. The molecular 
information obtained by glycoproteomic analysis performed by mass spectrometry 
has led to new insights into the mechanism linking aberrant glycosylation to 
cancer cell proliferation, migration and immunoescape.
