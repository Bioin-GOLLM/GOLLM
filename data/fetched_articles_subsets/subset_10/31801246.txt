To evaluate whether grafting of autologous mesenchymal cells, adipose-derived 
stem cells, and platelet-rich plasma into the supracoroideal space by surgical 
treatment with the Limoli retinal restoration technique (LRRT) can exert a 
beneficial effect in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients. Twenty-one eyes 
underwent surgery and were divided based on retinal foveal thickness (FT) ≤ 190 
or > 190 µm into group A-FT and group B-FT, respectively. The specific LRRT 
triad was grafted in a deep scleral pocket above the choroid of each eye. At 
6-month follow-up, group B showed a non-significant improvement in residual 
close-up visus and sensitivity at microperimetry compared to group A. After an 
in-depth review of molecular biology studies concerning degenerative phenomena 
underlying the etiopathogenesis of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), it was concluded 
that further research is needed on tapeto-retinal degenerations, both from a 
clinical and molecular point of view, to obtain better functional results. In 
particular, it is necessary to increase the number of patients, extend 
observation timeframes, and treat subjects in the presence of still trophic 
retinal tissue to allow adequate biochemical and functional catering.
