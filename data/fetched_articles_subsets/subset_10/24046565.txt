The title complex (CX1), [Na(C18H36N2O6)]I·1.5C2F4I2, is a three-component 
adduct containing a [2.2.2]-cryptand, sodium iodide and 
1,1,2,2-tetra-fluoro-1,2-di-iodo-ethane. The di-iodo-ethane works as a bidentate 
halogen-bonding (XB) donor, the [2.2.2]-cryptand chelates the sodium cation, and 
the iodide counter-ion acts as a tridentate XB acceptor. A (6,3) network is 
formed in which iodide anions are the nodes and halocarbons the sides. The 
network symmetry is C 3i and the I⋯I(-) XB distance is 3.4492 (5) Å. This 
network is strongly deformed and wrinkled. It forms a layer 9.6686 (18) Å high 
and the inter-layer distance is 4.4889 (10) Å. The cations, inter-acting with 
each other via weak O⋯H hydrogen bonds, are confined between two anionic layers 
and also form a (6,3) net. The structure of CX1 is closely related to that of 
the KI homologue (CX2). The 1,1,2,2,-tetrafluoro-1,2-diiodoethane molecule is 
rotationally disordered around the I⋯I axis, resulting in an 1:1 disorder of the 
C2F4 moiety.
