We analyzed variations in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) genome during a flight-related cluster outbreak of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Shenzhen, China, to explore the characteristics of 
SARS-CoV-2 transmission and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs) in a 
confined space. Thirty-three patients with COVID-19 were sampled, and 14 were 
resampled 3-31 days later. All 47 nasopharyngeal swabs were deep-sequenced. 
iSNVs and similarities in the consensus genome sequence were analyzed. Three 
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, Delta (n = 31), Beta (n = 1), and C.1.2 (n = 1), 
were detected among the 33 patients. The viral genome sequences from 30 
Delta-positive patients had similar SNVs; 14 of these patients provided two 
successive samples. Overall, the 47 sequenced genomes contained 164 iSNVs. Of 
the 14 paired (successive) samples, the second samples (T2) contained more iSNVs 
(median: 3; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.77-10.22) than did the first 
samples (T1; median: 2; 95% CI: 1.63-3.74; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.021). 38 iSNVs 
were detected in T1 samples, and only seven were also detectable in T2 samples. 
Notably, T2 samples from two of the 14 paired samples had additional mutations 
than the T1 samples. The iSNVs of the SARS-CoV-2 genome exhibited rapid dynamic 
changes during a flight-related cluster outbreak event. Intra-host diversity 
increased gradually with time, and new site mutations occurred in vivo without a 
population transmission bottleneck. Therefore, we could not determine the 
generational relationship from the mutation site changes alone.
