Applying the Emax model in a Lowe additivity model context, we analyze data from 
a combination study of trimetrexate (TMQ) and AG2034 (AG) in media of low and 
high concentrations of folic acid (FA). The Emax model provides a sufficient fit 
to the data. TMQ is more potent than AG in both low and high FA media. At low 
TMQ:AG ratios, when a smaller amount of the more potent drug (TMQ) is added to a 
larger amount of the less potent drug (AG), synergy results. When the TMQ:AG 
ratio reaches 0.4 or larger in low FA medium, or when the TMQ:AG ratio reaches 1 
or larger in high FA medium, synergy is weakened and drug interaction becomes 
additive. In general, synergistic effect in a dilution series is stronger at 
higher doses that produce stronger effects (closer to 1-Emax) than at lower dose 
levels that produce weaker effects (closer to 1). The two drugs are more potent 
in the low compared to the high FA medium. Drug synergy, however, is stronger in 
the high FA medium.
