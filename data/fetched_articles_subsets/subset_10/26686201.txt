BACKGROUND: There is crosstalk between the ANG-Tie2 and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR 
pathways. Combined ANG1/2 and mTOR blockade may have additive anti-cancer 
activity. The combination of trebananib, an inhibitor of ANG1/2-Tie2 
interaction, with temsirolimus was evaluated in patients with advanced solid 
tumors to determine tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and preliminary 
antitumor activity.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled using 3 + 3 design, and were given intravenous 
trebananib and temsirolimus on Day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) were evaluated during cycle 1. Peripheral blood was 
collected for evaluation of Tie2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) and thymidine 
phosphorylase (TP). Sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling for trebananib drug 
levels was performed on Day 1 and 8 of cycle 2.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled, 6 at dose level (DL) 1, 7 at DL -1, 
and 8 at DL -2. No effect of temsirolimus on trebananib PK was observed. The 
most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were: fatigue (81 %), edema 
(62 %), anorexia (57 %), nausea (52 %), rash (43 %) and mucositis (43 %). The 
most common grade ≥ 3 AEs included lymphopenia (28 %) and fatigue (28 %). The 
MTD was exceeded at DL-2. Of 18 response evaluable patients, 1 partial response 
was observed (ER+/HER2-/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer) and 4 patients had 
prolonged SD ≥ 24 weeks. No correlation with clinical benefit was observed with 
change in number TEMs or TP expression in TEMs with treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The MTD was exceeded at trebananib 10 mg/kg weekly and temsirolimus 
20 mg weekly, with frequent overlapping toxicities including fatigue, edema, and 
anorexia.
