Generating a novel and optimized molecule with desired chemical properties is an 
essential part of the drug discovery process. Failure to meet one of the 
required properties can frequently lead to failure in a clinical test which is 
costly. In addition, optimizing these multiple properties is a challenging task 
because the optimization of one property is prone to changing other properties. 
In this paper, we pose this multi-property optimization problem as a sequence 
translation process and propose a new optimized molecule generator model based 
on the Transformer with two constraint networks: property prediction and 
similarity prediction. We further improve the model by incorporating score 
predictions from these constraint networks in a modified beam search algorithm. 
The experiments demonstrate that our proposed model, Controlled Molecule 
Generator (CMG), outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin for 
optimizing multiple properties simultaneously.
