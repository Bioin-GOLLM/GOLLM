AIMS: To clarify the phenotype-genotype relation associated with the A3243G 
mitochondrial DNA mutation.
METHODS: Five unrelated probands harbouring the A3243G mutation but presenting 
different clinical phenotype were analysed. Probands include Leigh syndrome 
(LS(3243)), mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke 
like episodes (MELAS(3243)), progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO(3243)), 
and mitochondrial diabetes mellitus (MDM(3243)). Extensive clinical, 
histological, biochemical, and molecular genetic studies were performed on five 
families.
RESULTS: All patients showed ragged red fibres (RRF), and focal cytochrome c 
oxidase (COX) deficiency except for the patient with MDM(3243). The mutation 
load was highest in the proband with LS(3243) (>90%), who also presented the 
highest proportion of RRF (68%) and COX negative fibres (10%), and severe 
complex I plus IV deficiency. These proportions were lower in the probands with 
PEO(3243) and with MDM(3243).
CONCLUSION: The most severe clinical phenotype, LS(3243), was associated with 
the highest proportion of the A3243G mutation as well as the most prominent 
histological and biochemical abnormalities.
