BACKGROUND: Microdeletions of 14q22q23 have been associated with eye 
abnormalities and pituitary defects. Other phenotypic features in deletion 
carriers including hearing loss and response to growth hormone therapy are less 
well recognized. We studied genotype and phenotype of three newly identified 
children with 14q22q23 deletions, two girls and one boy with bilateral 
anophthalmia, and compared them with previously published deletion patients and 
individuals with intragenic defects in genes residing in the region.
RESULTS: The three deletions were de novo and ranged in size between 5.8 and 
8.9 Mb. All three children lacked one copy of the OTX2 gene and in one of them 
the deletion involved also the BMP4 gene. All three patients presented partial 
conductive hearing loss which tended to improve with age. Analysis of endocrine 
and growth phenotypes showed undetectable anterior pituitary, growth hormone 
deficiency and progressive growth retardation in all three patients. Growth 
hormone therapy led to partial catch-up growth in two of the three patients but 
just prevented further height loss in the third.
CONCLUSIONS: The pituitary hypoplasia, growth hormone deficiency and growth 
retardation associated with 14q22q23 microdeletions are very remarkable, and the 
latter appears to have an atypical response to growth hormone therapy in some of 
the cases.
