Few genetic differences between human populations conform to the classic model 
of positive selection, in which a newly arisen mutation rapidly approaches 
fixation in one lineage, suggesting that adaptation more commonly occurs via 
moderate changes in standing variation at many loci. Detecting and 
characterizing this type of complex selection requires integrating individually 
ambiguous signatures across genomically and geographically extensive data. Here, 
we develop a novel approach to test the hypothesis that selection has favored 
modest divergence at particular loci multiple times in independent human 
populations. We find an excess of SNPs showing non-neutral parallel divergence, 
enriched for genic and nonsynonymous polymorphisms in genes encompassing diverse 
and often disease related functions. Repeated parallel evolution in the same 
direction suggests common selective pressures in disparate habitats. We test our 
method with extensive coalescent simulations and show that it is robust to a 
wide range of demographic events. Our results demonstrate phylogenetically 
orthogonal patterns of local adaptation caused by subtle shifts at many 
widespread polymorphisms that likely underlie substantial phenotypic diversity.
