BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are important pathogens that affect the 
health of humans and many additional animal species. IAVs are enveloped, 
negative single-stranded RNA viruses whose genome encodes at least ten proteins. 
The IAV nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein that associates with the 
viral RNA and is essential for virus replication. Understanding how IAVs 
interact with host proteins is essential for elucidating all of the required 
processes for viral replication, restrictions in species host range, and 
potential targets for antiviral therapies.
METHODS: In this study, the NP from a swine IAV was cloned into a yeast 
two-hybrid "bait" vector for expression of a yeast Gal4 binding domain (BD)-NP 
fusion protein. This "bait" was used to screen a Y2H human HeLa cell "prey" 
library which consisted of human proteins fused to the Gal4 protein's activation 
domain (AD). The interaction of "bait" and "prey" proteins resulted in 
activation of reporter genes.
RESULTS: Seventeen positive bait-prey interactions were isolated in yeast. All 
of the "prey" isolated also interact in yeast with a NP "bait" cloned from a 
human IAV strain. Isolation and sequence analysis of the cDNAs encoding the 
human prey proteins revealed ten different human proteins. These host proteins 
are involved in various host cell processes and structures, including purine 
biosynthesis (PAICS), metabolism (ACOT13), proteasome (PA28B), DNA-binding 
(MSANTD3), cytoskeleton (CKAP5), potassium channel formation (KCTD9), zinc 
transporter function (SLC30A9), Na+/K+ ATPase function (ATP1B1), and RNA 
splicing (TRA2B).
CONCLUSIONS: Ten human proteins were identified as interacting with IAV NP in a 
Y2H screen. Some of these human proteins were reported in previous screens aimed 
at elucidating host proteins relevant to specific viral life cycle processes 
such as replication. This study extends previous findings by suggesting a 
mechanism by which these host proteins associate with the IAV, i.e., physical 
interaction with NP. Furthermore, this study revealed novel host protein-NP 
interactions in yeast.
