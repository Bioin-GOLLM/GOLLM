N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal modification in mammalian 
mRNAs, is involved in many pathological processes. METTL16 is a recently 
identified m6A methyltransferase. However, its role in leukemia has yet to be 
investigated. Here, we show that METTL16 is a highly essential gene for the 
survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells via CRISPR-Cas9 screening and 
experimental validation. METTL16 is aberrantly overexpressed in human AML cells, 
especially in leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). 
Genetic depletion of METTL16 dramatically suppresses AML initiation/development 
and maintenance and significantly attenuates LSC/LIC self-renewal, while 
moderately influencing normal hematopoiesis in mice. Mechanistically, METTL16 
exerts its oncogenic role by promoting expression of branched-chain amino acid 
(BCAA) transaminase 1 (BCAT1) and BCAT2 in an m6A-dependent manner and 
reprogramming BCAA metabolism in AML. Collectively, our results characterize 
the METTL16/m6A/BCAT1-2/BCAA axis in leukemogenesis and highlight the essential 
role of METTL16-mediated m6A epitranscriptome and BCAA metabolism reprograming 
in leukemogenesis and LSC/LIC maintenance.
