Hereditary deafness is a genetically heterogeneous phenotype for which more than 
100 genomic loci have been identified thus far. By analysis of a consanguineous 
Palestinian family, GPSM2 was recently discovered to be the cause of autosomal 
recessive non-syndromic hearing loss DFNB82. Here, we report a second truncating 
mutation, GPSM2 p.Q562X, identified via autozygosity mapping in a consanguineous 
Turkish family. This report provides evidence for allelic heterogeneity of GPSM2 
and confirms its causative role for non-syndromic deafness.
