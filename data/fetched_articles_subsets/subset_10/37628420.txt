Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is an uncommon, infrequent, congenital disorder 
characterized by a triad of capillary malformation, varicosities, and tissue and 
bone hypertrophy. The presence of two of these three signs is enough to obtain 
the diagnosis. Capillary malformations are usually present at birth, whereas 
venous varicosities and limb hypertrophy become more evident later. The syndrome 
has usually a benign course, but serious complications involving various organs, 
such as gastrointestinal and genitourinary organs, as well as the central 
nervous system, may be observed. Recently, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome has been 
included in the group of PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) disorders. In 
terms of this disorder, new results in etiopathogenesis and in modalities of 
treatment have been advanced. We report here a review of the recent genetic 
findings, the main clinical characteristics and related severe complications, 
differential diagnoses with a similar disorder, and the management of patients 
with this complex and uncommon syndrome.
