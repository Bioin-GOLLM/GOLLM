We describe an African-American child with beta-thalassemia intermedia. 
Molecular studies revealed that the proband is a compound heterozygote for the 
-29 (A-->G) beta (+)-thalassemia mutation and an extensive deletion involving 
the delta- and beta-globin genes. The proband's mother is a simple carrier of 
the deletion and exhibits the phenotype of delta beta-thalassemia rather than 
hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. The deletion spans 11,767 bp, with 
the 5' deletion endpoint located 2,455 bp upstream of the delta-globin gene mRNA 
Cap site and the 3' endpoint located 441 bp downstream of the termination codon 
of the beta-globin gene. Based on this information, we have developed a 
polymerase chain reaction strategy for the rapid detection of this delta 
beta-thalassemia deletion.
