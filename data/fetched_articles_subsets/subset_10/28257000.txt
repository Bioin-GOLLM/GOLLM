Unfavorable redox conditions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can decrease the 
capacity for protein secretion, altering vital cell functions. While systems to 
manage reductive stress are well-established, how cells cope with an overly 
oxidizing ER remains largely undefined. In previous work (Wang et al., 2014), we 
demonstrated that the chaperone BiP is a sensor of overly oxidizing ER 
conditions. We showed that modification of a conserved BiP cysteine during 
stress beneficially alters BiP chaperone activity to cope with suboptimal 
folding conditions. How this cysteine is reduced to reestablish 'normal' BiP 
activity post-oxidative stress has remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that 
BiP's nucleotide exchange factor - Sil1 - can reverse BiP cysteine oxidation. 
This previously unexpected reductant capacity for yeast Sil1 has potential 
implications for the human ataxia Marinesco-Sj√∂gren syndrome, where it is 
interesting to speculate that a disruption in ER redox-signaling (due to genetic 
defects in SIL1) may influence disease pathology.
