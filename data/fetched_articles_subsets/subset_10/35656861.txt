Most neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease are proteinopathies 
linked to the toxicity of amyloid oligomers. Treatments to delay or cure these 
diseases are lacking. Using budding yeast, we report that the natural lipid 
tripentadecanoin induces expression of the nitric oxide oxidoreductase Yhb1 to 
prevent the formation of protein aggregates during aging and extends replicative 
lifespan. In mammals, tripentadecanoin induces expression of the Yhb1 
orthologue, neuroglobin, to protect neurons against amyloid toxicity. 
Tripentadecanoin also rescues photoreceptors in a mouse model of retinal 
degeneration and retinal ganglion cells in a Rhesus monkey model of optic 
atrophy. Together, we propose that tripentadecanoin affects p-bodies to induce 
neuroglobin expression and offers a potential treatment for proteinopathies and 
retinal neurodegeneration.
