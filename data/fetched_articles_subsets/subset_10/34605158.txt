Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers that 
regulate gene expression. We investigated whether variants in BET genes are 
associated with survival outcomes for lung cancer. To do this, the associations 
between 77 variants in BET family genes and survival outcomes were analyzed in 
773 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who underwent surgery (349 and 
424 patients in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively). We found 
that six variants were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in 
the discovery cohort, and one variant (rs2506711C>T) was replicated in the 
validation cohort. BRD3 rs2506711C>T is located in the repressed area and has a 
strong linkage disequilibrium with rs2427964C>T in the promoter region. BRD3 
rs2427964C>T was significantly associated with worse OS in the discovery cohort, 
validation cohort, and combined analysis. In a luciferase assay, promoter 
activity in the BRD3 rs2427964 T allele was significantly higher than that in 
the BRD3 rs2427964 C allele, which selectively bound with the transcriptional 
repressor SIN3A. Knockdown of BRD3 with BRD3-specific siRNA decreased the 
proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells while also increasing the rate 
of apoptosis. These results suggest that BRD3 rs2427964C>T increases BRD3 
expression through increased promoter activity, which is associated with poor 
prognosis for lung cancer.
