Objectives: To examine the association between smoking cessation and risk of 
type 2 diabetes with emphasis on post-cessation weight gain. Methods: In total, 
8,951 participants from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study at 
the baseline (2011) were included. Diabetes incidence was accessed at the third 
survey (2015). Current smokers were treated as the reference and odds ratios 
(OR) of type 2 diabetes for never smokers, recent, and long-term quitters were 
computed using multivariable logistic regression. Stratified analysis was 
further conducted by weight gain after smoking cessation. Results: There were 
712 cases of type 2 diabetes identified. Compared with current smokers, the 
fully multivariable-adjusted ORs were 1.55 (1.02, 2.36) for recent quitters, 
0.88 (0.61, 1.28) for long-term quitters, and 0.75 (0.59, 0.95) for never 
smokers. Stratified analysis showed recent quitters with weight gain of ≥2.0 kg 
had a significantly higher odds of type 2 diabetes [2.25 (1.02, 4.95)]. 
Conclusion: The present study of the Chinese population suggested recent 
quitters with weight gain of ≥2.0 kg, compared with current smokers, had a 
significantly increased odds of type 2 diabetes.
