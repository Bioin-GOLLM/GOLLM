BACKGROUND: As one of the microelements, nitrogen play essential roles in cereal 
production. Although the use of chemical fertilizers has significantly improved 
the yield of wheat, it has also caused increasingly adverse environmental 
pollution. Revealing the molecular mechanism manipulating wheat nitrogen use 
efficiency (NUE), and cultivating wheat germplasms with high nitrogen use 
efficiency has become important goals for wheat researchers. In this study, we 
investigated the physiological and transcriptional differences of three wheat 
cultivars with different NUE under low nitrogen stress.
RESULTS: The results showed that, under low nitrogen conditions, the activities 
of nitrogen metabolism-related enzymes (GS, NR, GDH), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, 
POD, CAT) and soluble protein contents of ZM366 (high NUE cultivar) were higher 
than those of JD8 (low NUE cultivar). The hybrid cultivar of ZM366 and JD8 
showed mid-parent or over-parent heterosis. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 
'alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism', 'terpenoid backbone biosynthesis' 
and 'vitamin B6 metabolism' pathways play key roles in nitrogen use efficiency 
in wheat. The significant enhancement of the 'Calvin cycle' and 
'photorespiration' in ZM366 contributed to its higher level of carbon metabolism 
under low nitrogen stress, which is an important attribute differs from the 
other two varieties. In addition, the activation of ABA signal transduction and 
biosynthesis pathways also helps to maintain NUE under low- nitrogen conditions. 
Moreover, bHLH transcription factors were also found to play a positive role in 
wheat NUE.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these results enriched our knowledge of the 
mechanism of wheat NUE, and provided a theoretical basis for improving wheat NUE 
and breeding new cultivars.
