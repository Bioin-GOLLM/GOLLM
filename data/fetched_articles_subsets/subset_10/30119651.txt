BACKGROUND: Thalassemias (TM) are the most common autosomal recessive disorders 
in Southeast Asian countries. Both α- and β-thalassemia lead to a decrease or 
absence of globin chains. The most serious of the thalassemia syndromes is 
thalassemia major which is characterized by a transfusion dependent anemia and 
subsequent iron overload caused by repeated blood transfusions. It is preventive 
by genotyping the parents. A better understanding of the laboratory data will 
help provide an accurate diagnosis of thalassemia major, and prevention and 
controlling programs in routine laboratories.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a one-year-old boy born to non-consanguineous 
parents. He was referred to our outpatient clinic for hemolytic anemia after a 
cold. Hematological investigations revealed severe anemia (Hb57 g/dL). The red 
cells displayed microcytosis, hypochromia and misshapen erythrocytes 
(MCV48.8 fL, MCH15.7 pg). Capillary electrophoresis (CE) electropherogram 
revealed normal level of HbA2 (3.2%) and elevated HbF (35.1%). The patient was 
diagnosed with β-TM, based on severe microcytosis, hypochromia, normal Hb A2 and 
high Hb F level but no Hb H inclusion at the first visit. Later our molecular 
analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for codons 41-42 (-TTCT) (HBB: 
c.126_129delCTTT, β0) and IVS-II-654 (C > T) (HBB: c.316-197C > T, β+) mutation 
and deletional Hb H (--SEA/-α3.7). Thus, a combination of Hb H disease and a 
compound heterozygosity of β+/β0-thalassemia (β+/β0-thal) was finally diagnosed.
CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-phenotype analysis shows that heterozygous mutations in 
the β-globin gene could affect not only hematological parameters, but also 
elevate HbA2 levels. These effects could be ameliorated by the coinheritance of 
Hb H disease, which may be explained by the phenomena of the α-globin gene and 
of the β-globin gene balanced effect.
