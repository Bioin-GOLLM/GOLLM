Tyr78Phe is a rare pathogenic transthyretin (TTR) mutation. Few previous reports 
described a late-onset hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis (ATTR-m) 
form with a variable phenotype, mainly dominated by neurological manifestations. 
We describe the case of a 69-year-old male with massive but asymptomatic cardiac 
infiltration and only subclinical neurological involvement, and review the 
literature to depict characteristics of the Tyr78Phe TTR mutation.
