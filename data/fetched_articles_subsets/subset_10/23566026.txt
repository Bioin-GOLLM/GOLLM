BACKGROUND: Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare autosomal recessive 
bleeding disorder characterized by giant platelets, thrombocytopenia, and a 
prolonged bleeding time, which is caused by homozygous mutations in the GPIbα, 
GPIbβ, or GPIX genes. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is caused by a 
microdeletion on chromosome 22, which includes the GPIbβ gene, and is 
characterized by abnormal development of the pharyngeal apparatus and heart. 
Thus, patients with 22q11.2DS are obligate carriers for BSS.
METHODS: We evaluated two infants with BSS and performed the genetic analysis of 
the GPIbα, GPIbβ, or GPIX genes, and investigated the segregation of the 
mutation within the families. The status of the 22q11.2 deletion was examined by 
fluorescence in situ hybridization and single-nucleotide polymorphism array copy 
number analysis.
RESULTS: DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the infants were compound 
heterozygous for a hemizygous mutation in the GPIbβ gene (p.Trp148X and 
p.Leu97Phe, respectively) and 22q11.2 deletion in the other chromosome. Both 
infants had the common 3Mb 22q11.2 deletion but did not show major phenotypic 
features of 22q11.2DS, such as developmental delay, cardiac defects, dysmorphic 
facial features, palatal anomalies, hypocalcemia, and immune deficiency. The 
22q11.2DS would not have become clear if detailed molecular genetic analyses of 
BSS had not been performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our cases illustrate that a suspicion of 22q11.2 deletion is 
warranted in pediatric BSS patients with a mutation in the GPIbβ gene, even 
without remarkable symptoms.
