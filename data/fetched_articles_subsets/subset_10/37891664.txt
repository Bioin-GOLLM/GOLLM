BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has two clinical characteristics: 
high missed diagnosis and dysfunction of leukocytes. Transcriptional RNA on 
leukocytes is closely related to the course evolution of AMI patients. We 
hypothesized that transcriptional RNA in leukocytes might provide potential 
diagnostic value for AMI. Integration machine learning (IML) was first used to 
explore AMI discrimination genes. The following clinical study was performed to 
validate the results.
METHODS: A total of four AMI microarrays (derived from the Gene Expression 
Omnibus) were included in bioanalysis (220 sample size). Then, the clinical 
validation was finished with 20 AMI and 20 stable coronary artery disease 
patients (SCAD). At a ratio of 5:2, GSE59867 was included in the training set, 
while GSE60993, GSE62646, and GSE48060 were included in the testing set. IML was 
explicitly proposed in this research, which is composed of six machine learning 
algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), random 
forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), decision trees (DT), and least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). IML had two functions in this 
research: filtered optimized variables and predicted the categorized value. 
Finally, The RNA of the recruited patients was analyzed to verify the results of 
IML.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified 
between controls and AMI individuals from the training sets. Among the 
thirty-nine DEGs, IML was used to process the predicted classification model and 
identify potential candidate genes with overall normalized weights > 1. Finally, 
two genes (AQP9 and SOCS3) show their diagnosis value with the area under the 
curve (AUC) > 0.9 in both the training and testing sets. The clinical study 
verified the significance of AQP9 and SOCS3. Notably, more stenotic coronary 
arteries or severe Killip classification indicated higher levels of these two 
genes, especially SOCS3. These two genes correlated with two immune cell types, 
monocytes and neutrophils.
CONCLUSION: AQP9 and SOCS3 in leukocytes may be conducive to identifying AMI 
patients with SCAD patients. AQP9 and SOCS3 are closely associated with 
monocytes and neutrophils, which might contribute to advancing AMI diagnosis and 
shed light on novel genetic markers. Multiple clinical characteristics, 
multicenter, and large-sample relevant trials are still needed to confirm its 
clinical value.
