We propose a statistical multiscale mapping approach to identify microscopic and 
molecular heterogeneity across a tumor microenvironment using multiparametric MR 
(mp-MR). Twenty-nine patients underwent pre-surgical mp-MR followed by MR-guided 
stereotactic core biopsy. The locations of the biopsy cores were identified in 
the pre-surgical images using stereotactic bitmaps acquired during surgery. 
Feature matrices mapped the multiparametric voxel values in the vicinity of the 
biopsy cores to the pathologic outcome variables for each patient and logistic 
regression tested the individual and collective predictive power of the MR 
contrasts. A non-parametric weighted k-nearest neighbor classifier evaluated the 
feature matrices in a leave-one-out cross validation design across patients. 
Resulting class membership probabilities were converted to chi-square statistics 
to develop full-brain parametric maps, implementing Gaussian random field theory 
to estimate inter-voxel dependencies. Corrections for family-wise error rates 
were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg and random field theory, and the 
resulting accuracies were compared. The combination of all five image contrasts 
correlated with outcome (P < 10-4) for all four microscopic variables. The 
probabilistic mapping method using Benjamini-Hochberg generated statistically 
significant results (α ≤ 0.05) for three of the four dependent variables: (1) 
IDH1, (2) MGMT, and (3) microvascular proliferation, with an average 
classification accuracy of 0.984 ± 0.02 and an average classification 
sensitivity of 1.567% ± 0.967. The images corrected by random field theory 
demonstrated improved classification accuracy (0.989 ± 0.008) and classification 
sensitivity (5.967% ± 2.857) compared with Benjamini-Hochberg. Microscopic and 
molecular tumor properties can be assessed with statistical confidence across 
the brain from minimally-invasive, mp-MR.
