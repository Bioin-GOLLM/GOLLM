Bacteria-host interactions are characterized by the delivery of bacterial 
virulence factors, i.e., effectors, into host cells where they counteract host 
immunity and exploit host responses allowing bacterial survival and spreading. 
These effectors are translocated into host cells by means of dedicated secretion 
systems such as the type 3 secretion system (T3SS). A comprehensive 
understanding of effector translocation in a spatio-temporal manner is of 
critical importance to gain insights into an effector's mode of action. Various 
approaches have been developed to understand timing and order of effector 
translocation, quantities of translocated effectors and their subcellular 
localization upon translocation into host cells. Recently, the existing toolset 
has been expanded by newly developed state-of-the art methods to monitor 
bacterial effector translocation and dynamics. In this review, we elaborate on 
reported methods and discuss recent advances and shortcomings in this area of 
tracking bacterial effector translocation.
