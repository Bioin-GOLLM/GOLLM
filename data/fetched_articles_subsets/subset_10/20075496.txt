Stem cells, as subjects of study for use in treating neurological diseases, are 
envisioned as a replacement for lost neurons and glia, a means of trophic 
support, a therapeutic vehicle, and, more recently, a tool for in vitro modeling 
to understand disease and to screen and personalize treatments. In this review 
we analyze the requirements of stem cell-based therapy for clinical translation, 
advances in stem cell research toward clinical application for neurological 
disorders, and different animal models used for analysis of these potential 
therapies. We focus on Parkinson's disease (typically defined by the progressive 
loss of dopaminergic nigral neurons), stroke (neurodegeneration associated with 
decreased blood perfusion in the brain), and multiple sclerosis (an autoimmune 
disorder that generates demyelination, axonal damage, astrocytic scarring, and 
neurodegeneration in the brain and spinal cord). We chose these disorders for 
their diversity and the number of people affected by them. An additional 
important consideration was the availability of multiple animal models in which 
to test stem cell applications for these diseases. We also discuss the 
relationship between the limited number of systematic stem cell studies 
performed in animals, in particular nonhuman primates and the delayed progress 
in advancing stem cell therapies to clinical success.
