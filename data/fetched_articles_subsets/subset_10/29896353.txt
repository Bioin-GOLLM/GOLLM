Introduction of a biotinylated monophosphine palladium complex within 
streptavidin affords an enantioselective artificial Suzukiase. Site-directed 
mutagenesis allowed the optimization of the activity and the enantioselectivity 
of this artificial metalloenzyme. A variety of atropisomeric biaryls were 
produced in good yields and up to 90% ee. The hybrid catalyst described herein 
shows comparable TOF to the previous aqueous-asymmetric Suzuki catalysts, and 
excellent stability under the reaction conditions to realize higher TON through 
longer reaction time.
