BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: REALITY is an international observational retrospective 
registry of LHON patients evaluating the visual course and outcome in Leber 
hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Demographics and visual function data were collected from 
medical charts of LHON patients with visual loss. The study was conducted in 11 
study centres in the United States of America and Europe. The collection period 
extended from the presymptomatic stage to at least more than one year after 
onset of vision loss (chronic stage). A Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing 
(LOWESS) local regression model was used to analyse the evolution of 
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) over time.
RESULTS: 44 LHON patients were included; 27 (61%) carried the m.11778G>A ND4 
mutation, 8 (18%) carried the m.3460G>A ND1 mutation, and 9 (20%) carried the 
m.14484T>C ND6 mutation. Fourteen (32%) patients were under 18 years old at 
onset of vision loss and 5 (11%) were below the age of 12. The average duration 
of follow-up was 32.5 months after onset of symptoms. At the last observed 
measure, mean BCVA was 1.46 LogMAR in ND4 patients, 1.52 LogMAR in ND1 patients, 
and 0.97 LogMAR in ND6 patients. The worst visual outcomes were reported in ND4 
patients aged at least 15 years old at onset, with a mean BCVA of 1.55 LogMAR 
and no tendency for spontaneous recovery. The LOESS modelling curve depicted a 
severe and permanent deterioration of BCVA.
CONCLUSIONS: Amongst LHON patients with the three primary mtDNA mutations, adult 
patients with the m.11778G>A ND4 mutation had the worst visual outcomes, 
consistent with prior reports.
