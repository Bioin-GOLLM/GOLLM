BACKGROUNDS: Scutellaria Pinnatifida subsp. pichleri (Stapf) Rech.f. (SP) is 
used in folk medicine for the treatment of diabetes. The aim of the study was to 
determine the phenolic profile of SP extract (SPE) by LC-MS/MS and to 
investigate the antidiabetic, hepatoprotective and nephroprotective effects of 
SPE in streptozotosin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model.
METHODS: Forty-two rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 7): Control 
(nondiabetic), diabetes mellitus (DM), DM + SP-100 (diabetic rats treated with 
SPE, 100 mg/kg/day), DM + SP-200 (diabetic rats treated with SPE, 
200 mg/kg/day), DM + SP-400 (diabetic rats treated with SPE, 400 mg/kg/day) and 
DM + Gly-3 (diabetic rats treated with glibenclamide, 3 mg/kg/day). Live body 
weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG) level, antidiabetic, serum biochemical and 
lipid profile parameters, antioxidant defense system, malondyaldehyde (MDA) and 
histopathological examinations in liver, kidney and pancreas were evaluated.
RESULTS: Apigenin, luteolin, quinic acid, cosmosiin and epigallocatechin were 
determined to be the major phenolic compounds in the SPE. Administration of the 
highest dose of SP extract (400 mg/kg) resulted in a significant reduction in 
FBG levels and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats, 
indicating an antihyperglycemic effect. SPE (200 and 400 mg/kg) and 
glibenclamide significantly improved MDA in liver and kidney tissues. In 
addition, SPE contributed to the struggle against STZ-induced oxidative stress 
by stimulating antioxidant defense systems. STZ induction negatively affected 
liver, kidney and pancreas tissues according to histopathological findings. 
Treatment with 400 mg/kg and glibenclamide attenuated these negative effects.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the extract of the aerial part of Scutellaria 
pinnatifida subsp. pichleri has hepatoprotective, nephroprotective and insulin 
secretion stimulating effects against STZ-induced diabetes and its complications 
due to its antidiabetic and antioxidant phytochemicals such as apigenin, 
luteolin, quinic acid, cosmosiin and epigallocatechin.
