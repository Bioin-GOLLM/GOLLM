A combined biophysical approach was applied to map gas-docking sites within 
murine neuroglobin (Ngb), revealing snapshots of events that might govern 
activity and dynamics in this unique hexacoordinate globin, which is most likely 
to be involved in gas-sensing in the central nervous system and for which a 
precise mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. The application of 
UV-visible microspectroscopy in crystallo, solution X-ray absorption near-edge 
spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments at 15-40 K provided the 
structural characterization of an Ngb photolytic intermediate by cryo-trapping 
and allowed direct observation of the relocation of carbon monoxide within the 
distal heme pocket after photodissociation. Moreover, X-ray diffraction at 100 K 
under a high pressure of dioxygen, a physiological ligand of Ngb, unravelled the 
existence of a storage site for O2 in Ngb which coincides with Xe-III, a 
previously described docking site for xenon or krypton. Notably, no other 
secondary sites were observed under our experimental conditions.
