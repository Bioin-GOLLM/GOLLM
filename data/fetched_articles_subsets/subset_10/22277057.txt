The adenosine-A(3) receptor (A(3)AR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that shows 
promise as a therapeutic target for cancer, glaucoma, and various autoimmune 
inflammatory disorders, and as such, there is a need for molecular probes to 
study this receptor. Here, we report a series of fluorescent ligands containing 
different linkers and fluorophores based around a 
1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one antagonist. One of these conjugates (19) 
displayed high affinity for the A(3)AR (pK(D) = 9.36 ± 0.12) and is >650-fold 
selective over other adenosine receptor subtypes. Confocal microscopy revealed 
clear, displaceable membrane labeling of CHO-A(3) cells with 19, with no 
detectable labeling of CHO-A(1) cells under identical conditions. This 
fluorescent ligand was also able to specifically label the A(3)AR in HEK293T 
cells containing a mixed adenosine receptor population. The subtype specificity, 
along with its excellent imaging properties, make 19 an ideal tool for studying 
A(3)AR distribution and organization, particularly in the presence of other 
adenosine receptor subtypes.
