Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease, 
and the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our findings demonstrated 
that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) promoted fibrosis progression by directly 
interacting with Smad7 and reinforcing transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) 
signaling. Total PKM2 expression and the portion of the tetrameric form elevated 
in lungs and fibroblasts were derived from mice with bleomycin (BLM)-induced 
pulmonary fibrosis. Pkm2 deletion markedly alleviated BLM-induced fibrosis 
progression, myofibroblast differentiation, and TGF-β1 signaling activation. 
Further study showed that PKM2 tetramer enhanced TGF-β1 signaling by directly 
binding with Smad7 on its MH2 domain, and thus interfered with the interaction 
between Smad7 and TGF-β type I receptor (TβR1), decreased TβR1 ubiquitination, 
and stabilized TβR1. Pharmacologically enhanced PKM2 tetramer by TEPP-46 
promoted BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, while tetramer disruption by compound 
3k alleviated fibrosis progression. Our results demonstrate how PKM2 regulates 
TGF-β1 signaling and is a key factor in fibrosis progression.
