Two distinct syndromes arise from pathogenic variants in the X-linked gene BCOR 
(BCL-6 corepressor): oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) syndrome, which affects 
females, and a severe microphthalmia ('Lenz'-type) syndrome affecting males. 
OFCD is an X-linked dominant syndrome caused by a variety of BCOR null 
mutations. As it manifests only in females, it is presumed to be lethal in 
males. The severe male X-linked recessive microphthalmia syndrome ('Lenz') 
usually includes developmental delay in addition to the eye findings and is 
caused by hypomorphic BCOR variants, mainly by a specific missense variant 
c.254C > T, p.(Pro85Leu). Here, we detail 16 new cases (11 females with 4 
additional, genetically confirmed, affected female relatives; 5 male cases each 
with unaffected carrier mothers). We describe new variants and broaden the 
phenotypic description for OFCD to include neuropathy, muscle hypotonia, 
pituitary underdevelopment, brain atrophy, lipoma and the first description of 
childhood lymphoma in an OFCD case. Our male X-linked recessive cases show 
significant new phenotypes: developmental delay (without eye anomalies) in two 
affected half-brothers with a novel BCOR variant, and one male with high myopia, 
megalophthalmos, posterior embryotoxon, developmental delay, and heart and bony 
anomalies with a previously undescribed BCOR splice site variant. Our female 
OFCD cases and their affected female relatives showed variable features, but 
consistently had early onset cataracts. We show that a mosaic carrier mother 
manifested early cataract and dental anomalies. All female carriers of the male 
X-linked recessive cases for whom genetic confirmation was available showed 
skewed X-inactivation and were unaffected. In view of the extended phenotype, we 
suggest a new term of X-linked BCOR-related syndrome.
