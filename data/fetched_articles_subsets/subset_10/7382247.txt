Possible gonadal mosaicism in a family with hemoglobin Köln.

Bradley TB, Wohl RC, Petz LD, Perkins HA, Reynolds RD.

A brother and sister were the first members of a family to possess hemoglobin 
Köln (alpha 2 beta 2(98) Val leads to Met). Studies of these siblings and their 
parents strongly indicated that the anomaly had arisen by spontaneous mutation. 
Gonadal mosaicism of one of the parents offers the best explanation for the 
appearance of a spontaneous mutation in multiple members of a sibship.
