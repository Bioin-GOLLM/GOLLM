In April 2012, a group of nephrologists organized a consensus conference in 
Cambridge (UK) on type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and decided 
to use a new terminology, "C3 glomerulopathy" (C3 GP). Further knowledge on the 
complement system and on kidney biopsy contributed toward distinguishing this 
disease into three subgroups: dense deposit disease (DDD), C3 glomerulonephritis 
(C3 GN), and the CFHR5 nephropathy. The persistent presence of microhematuria 
with or without light or heavy proteinuria after an infection episode suggests 
the potential onset of C3 GP. These nephritides are characterized by abnormal 
activation of the complement alternative pathway, abnormal deposition of C3 in 
the glomeruli, and progression of renal damage to end-stage kidney disease. The 
diagnosis is based on studying the complement system, relative genetics, and 
kidney biopsies. The treatment gap derives from the absence of a robust 
understanding of their natural outcome. Therefore, a specific treatment for the 
different types of C3 GP has not been established. Recommendations have been 
obtained from case series and observational studies because no randomized 
clinical trials have been conducted. Current treatment is based on 
corticosteroids and antiproliferative drugs (cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate 
mofetil), monoclonal antibodies (rituximab) or complement inhibitors 
(eculizumab). In some cases, it is suggested to include sessions of plasma 
exchange.
