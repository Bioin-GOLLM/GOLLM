The role of variable regions of HIV-1 gp120 in immune escape of HIV has been 
investigated. However, there is scant information on how conserved gp120 regions 
contribute to virus escaping. Here we have studied how molecular sequence 
characteristics of conserved C3, C4 and V3 regions of clade C HIV-1 gp120 that 
are involved in HIV entry and are target of the immune response, are modulated 
during the disease course. We found an increase of "shifting" putative 
N-glycosylation sites (PNGSs) in the α2 helix (in C3) and in C4 and an increase 
of sites under positive selection pressure in the α2 helix during the chronic 
stage of disease. These sites are close to CD4 and to co-receptor binding sites. 
We also found a negative correlation between electric charges of C3 and V4 
during the late stage of disease counteracted by a positive correlation of 
electric charges of α2 helix and V5 during the same stage. These data allow us 
to hypothesize possible mechanisms of virus escape involving constant and 
variable regions of gp120. In particular, new mutations, including new PNGSs 
occurring near the CD4 and CCR5 binding sites could potentially affect receptor 
binding affinity and shield the virus from the immune response.
