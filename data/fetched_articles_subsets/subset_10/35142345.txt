Candida infections constitute a blind spot in global public health as very few 
new anti-fungal drugs are being developed. Genetic surveys of host 
susceptibilities to such infections using mammalian models have certain 
disadvantages in that obtaining results is time-consuming, owing to relatively 
long lifespans, and these results have low statistical resolution because sample 
sizes are usually small. Here, we report a targeted genetic screening of 5698 
RNAi lines encompassing 4135 Drosophila genes with human homologues, several of 
which we identify as important for host survival after Candida albicans 
infection. These include genes in a variety of functional classes encompassing 
gene expression, intracellular signalling, metabolism and enzymatic regulation. 
Analysis of one of the screen hits, the infection-induced α-(1,3)-fucosylase 
FucTA, showed that N-glycan fucosylation has several targets among proteins 
involved in host defence, which provides multiple avenues of investigation for 
the mechanistic analysis of host survival to systemic C. albicans infection.
