Some studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of 
diabetes independently of antipsychotic use. People with deficit schizophrenia, 
which is characterized by primary (or idiopathic), enduring negative symptoms, 
differ from those with nondeficit schizophrenia on course of illness, treatment 
response, risk factors, and biological correlates. We hypothesized that deficit 
and nondeficit subjects would also differ with regard to glucose tolerance. 
Newly diagnosed, antipsychotic-na√Øve subjects with nonaffective psychosis and 
matched control subjects were administered a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test 
(GTT). Two-hour glucose concentrations were significantly higher in the 
nondeficit patients (N=23; mean [SD] of 121.6 [42.0]) than in deficit (N=23; 
100.2 [23.1]) and control subjects (N=59; 83.8 [21.9]); the deficit subjects 
also had significantly higher two-hour glucose concentrations than did the 
control subjects. These results provide further support that the deficit group 
has a distinctive etiopathophysiology.
