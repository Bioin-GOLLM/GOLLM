CausalPath (causalpath.org) evaluates proteomic measurements against prior 
knowledge of biological pathways and infers causality between changes in 
measured features, such as global protein and phospho-protein levels. It uses 
pathway resources to determine potential causality between observable omic 
features, which are called prior relations. The subset of the prior relations 
that are supported by the proteomic profiles are reported and evaluated for 
statistical significance. The end result is a network model of signaling that 
explains the patterns observed in the experimental dataset. For complete details 
on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Babur et al. (2021).
