Liver regeneration (LR) is a complex process involving intricate networks of 
cellular connections, cytokines, and growth factors. During the early stages of 
LR, hepatocytes accumulate lipids, primarily triacylglycerol, and cholesterol 
esters, in the lipid droplets. Although it is widely accepted that this 
phenomenon contributes to LR, the impact of lipid droplet deposition on LR 
remains a matter of debate. Some studies have suggested that lipid droplet 
deposition has no effect or may even be detrimental to LR. This review article 
focuses on transient regeneration-associated steatosis and its relationship with 
the liver regenerative response.
