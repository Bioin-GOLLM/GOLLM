Background: In Bangladesh, dengue has been prevalent since its resurgence in 
2018, and the dominant causative virus in 2019 was considered dengue virus 
serotype 3 (DENV-3). However, limited information is available for DENV 
serotype/genotype circulating after 2020. Materials and Methods: Viral RNA was 
extracted from NS1 antigen-positive blood samples of febrile patients in Dhaka, 
in 2021. DENV gene was detected by semi-nested RT-PCR, and sequences of envelope 
(E) gene and C-prM gene were determined by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products 
for genetic analysis. Results: Among 172 NS1-positive samples collected, 91 
samples were assigned to DENV-3 and DENV-2 (88 and 3 samples, respectively) by 
RT-PCR targeting the C-prM gene. Phylogenetic analysis of the E gene for the 17 
representative DENV-3 samples showed that all the viruses belonged to genotype 
I, forming a cluster (B-cluster) with those of DENV-3 reported in Bangladesh in 
2017. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of E protein revealed 16 
amino acid substitutions, including two novel ones (G221W, L285P), and a 
substitution T223I that was specifically found in DENV-3 B-cluster. Conclusion: 
This study showed the persistent predominance of DENV-3 genotype I in Bangladesh 
having unique genetic traits in the E gene. (Approval number: MMC/IRB/2022/468).
