Pre-existing comorbidities such as obesity or metabolic diseases can adversely 
affect the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Chronic metabolic disorders are 
globally on the rise and often a consequence of an unhealthy diet, referred to 
as a Western Diet. For the first time in the Syrian hamster model, we 
demonstrate the detrimental impact of a continuous high-fat high-sugar diet on 
COVID-19 outcome. We observed increased weight loss and lung pathology, such as 
exudate, vasculitis, hemorrhage, fibrin, and edema, delayed viral clearance and 
functional lung recovery, and prolonged viral shedding. This was accompanied by 
an increased trend of systemic IL-10 and IL-6, as well as a dysregulated serum 
lipid response dominated by polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing 
phosphatidylethanolamine, recapitulating cytokine and lipid responses associated 
with severe human COVID-19. Our data support the hamster model for testing 
restrictive or targeted diets and immunomodulatory therapies to mediate the 
adverse effects of metabolic disease on COVID-19.
