The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 cleaves double-stranded DNA targets 
complementary to the guide RNA and has been applied to programmable genome 
editing. Cas9-mediated cleavage requires a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) 
juxtaposed with the DNA target sequence, thus constricting the range of 
targetable sites. Here, we report the 1.7 Å resolution crystal structures of 
Cas9 from Francisella novicida (FnCas9), one of the largest Cas9 orthologs, in 
complex with a guide RNA and its PAM-containing DNA targets. A structural 
comparison of FnCas9 with other Cas9 orthologs revealed striking conserved and 
divergent features among distantly related CRISPR-Cas9 systems. We found that 
FnCas9 recognizes the 5'-NGG-3' PAM, and used the structural information to 
create a variant that can recognize the more relaxed 5'-YG-3' PAM. Furthermore, 
we demonstrated that the FnCas9-ribonucleoprotein complex can be microinjected 
into mouse zygotes to edit endogenous sites with the 5'-YG-3' PAM, thus 
expanding the target space of the CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox.
