The terahertz (THz) radiation refers to electromagnetic waves between infrared 
and millimeter waves. THz technology has shown a significant potential for 
medical diagnosis and biomedical applications over the past three decades. 
Therefore, exploring the biological effects of THz waves has become an important 
new field in life sciences. Specifically, THz radiation has been proved to be 
able to diagnose and treat several head and neck diseases. In this review, we 
primarily discuss the biological characteristics of THz waves and clinical 
applications of THz technology, focusing on the research progress of THz 
technology in head and neck diseases (brain cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, oral 
diseases, thyroid nodules, Alzheimer's disease, eyes diseases, and otitis). The 
future application perspectives of THz technologies in head and neck diseases 
are also highlighted and proposed.
