Thyroid carcinoma is the most common endocrine malignancy, and although the 
disease generally has an excellent prognosis, therapeutic options are limited 
for patients not cured by surgery and radioiodine. Thyroid carcinomas commonly 
contain one of a small number of recurrent genetic mutations. The identification 
and study of these mutations has led to a deeper understanding of the 
pathophysiology of this disease and is providing new approaches to diagnosis and 
therapy. Papillary thyroid carcinomas usually contain an activating mutation in 
the RAS cascade, most commonly in BRAF and less commonly in RAS itself or 
through gene fusions that activate RET. A chromosomal translocation that results 
in production of a PAX8-PPARG fusion protein is found in follicular carcinomas. 
Anaplastic carcinomas may contain some of the above changes as well as 
additional mutations. Therapies that are targeted to these mutations are being 
used in patient care and clinical trials.
