Hearing loss has become increasingly prevalent and causes considerable 
disability, thus gravely burdening the global economy. Irreversible loss of hair 
cells is a main cause of sensorineural hearing loss, and currently, the only 
relatively effective clinical treatments are limited to digital hearing 
equipment like cochlear implants and hearing aids, but these are of limited 
benefit in patients. It is therefore urgent to understand the mechanisms of 
damage repair in order to develop new neuroprotective strategies. At present, 
how to promote the regeneration of functional hair cells is a key scientific 
question in the field of hearing research. Multiple signaling pathways and 
transcriptional factors trigger the activation of hair cell progenitors and 
ensure the maturation of newborn hair cells, and in this article, we first 
review the principal mechanisms underlying hair cell reproduction. We then 
further discuss therapeutic strategies involving the co-regulation of multiple 
signaling pathways in order to induce effective functional hair cell 
regeneration after degeneration, and we summarize current achievements in hair 
cell regeneration. Lastly, we discuss potential future approaches, such as small 
molecule drugs and gene therapy, which might be applied for regenerating 
functional hair cells in the clinic.
