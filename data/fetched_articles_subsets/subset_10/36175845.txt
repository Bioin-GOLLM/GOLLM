BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which can cause mild to 
serious infections in humans. We aimed to explore the effect of growth hormone 
(GH)/estrogen/androgen in normal human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells on 
COVID-19-type proinflammatory responses.
METHODS: A BEAS-2B COVID-19-like proinflammatory cell model was constructed. 
After that, the cells were treated with GH, 17β-estradiol (E2), and testosterone 
(Tes) for 24 h. CCK-8 assays were utilized to evaluate cell viability. The mRNA 
expression of ACE2, AGTR1, TMRRSS2, and ISG15 and the protein expression of 
ACE2, AGTR1, TMRRSS2, and ISG15 were measured by qRT‒PCR and Western blotting, 
respectively. ELISAs were performed to determine IL-6, MCP-1, MDA and SOD 
expression. Flow cytometry was used to measure ROS levels. Finally, MAPK/NF-κB 
pathway-related factor expression was evaluated.
RESULTS: The COVID-19-type proinflammatory model was successfully constructed, 
and 1000 ng/mL RBD treatment for 24 h was selected as the condition for the 
model group for subsequent experiments. After RBD treatment, cell viability 
decreased, the mRNA expression of ACE2, AGTR1, TMRRSS2, and ISG15 and the 
protein expression of ACE2, AGTR1, TMRRSS2, and ISG15 increased, IL-6, MCP-1, 
MDA and ROS levels increased, and MDA levels decreased. The mRNA levels of 
MAPK14 and RELA increased, but the protein levels did not change significantly. 
In addition, phospho-MAPK14 and phospho-RELA protein levels were also increased. 
Among the tested molecules, E2 had the most pronounced effect, followed by GH, 
while Tes showed the opposite effect.
CONCLUSION: GH/E2 alleviated inflammation in a COVID-19-type proinflammatory 
model, but Tes showed the opposite effect.
