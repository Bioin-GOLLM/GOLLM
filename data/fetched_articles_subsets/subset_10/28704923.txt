Beta-casein (BC) is frequently expressed as BC A2 and BC A1 in cow's milk. 
Gastrointestinal digestion of BC A1 results in the release of the opioid peptide 
beta-casomorphin 7 (BCM7) which is less likely to occur from BC A2. This work 
was aimed to produce milk containing BC A2 with no BC A1 (BC A2 milk) using 
genetically selected CSN2 A2A2 Jersey cows. Additionally, we aimed to develop an 
infant formula (IF) suitable for healthy full-term infants during the first six 
months of life based on BC A2 milk. The concentration of BCM7 released from BC 
A2 IF, from commercially available IFs as well as from human milk and raw cow's 
milk was evaluated after simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID). BC A2 IF 
presented the lowest mean relative abundance of BC A1 (IF 1 = 0.136 ± 0.010), 
compared with three commercially available IFs (IF 2 = 0.597 ± 0.020; IF 3 = 
0.441 ± 0.014; IF 4 = 0.503 ± 0.011). Accordingly, SGID of whole casein fraction 
from BC A2 IF resulted in a significantly lower release of BCM7 (IF 1 = 0.860 ± 
0.014 µg/100 mL) compared to commercially available IFs (IF 2 = 2.625 ± 0.042 
µg/100 mL; IF 3 = 1.693 ± 0.012 µg/100 mL; IF 4 = 1.962 ± 0.067 µg/100 mL). 
Nevertheless, BCM7 levels from BC A2 IF were significantly higher than those 
found in SGID hydrolysates of BC A2 raw milk (0.742 ± 0.008 µg/100 mL). 
Interestingly, results showed that BCM7 was also present in human milk in 
significantly lower amounts (0.697 ± 0.007 µg/100 mL) than those observed in IF 
1 and BC A2 milk. This work demonstrates that using BC A2 milk in IF formulation 
significantly reduces BCM7 formation during SGID. Clinical implications of BC A2 
IF on early infant health and development need further investigations.
