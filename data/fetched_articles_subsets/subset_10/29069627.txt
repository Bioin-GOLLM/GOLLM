Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein, plays a critical role in cell 
proliferation and tumorigenesis. SUMOylation, a reversible ubiquitination-like 
post-translational modification, is vital for tumor progression. Here, we report 
that the Src protein can be SUMOylated at lysine 318 both in vitro and in vivo. 
Hypoxia can induce a decrease of Src SUMOylation along with an increase of Y419 
phosphorylation, a phosphorylation event required for Src activation. On the 
other hand, treatment with hydrogen peroxide can enhance Src SUMOylation. 
Significantly, ectopic expression of SUMO-defective mutation, Src K318R, 
promotes tumor growth more potently than that of wild-type Src, as determined by 
migration assay, soft agar assay, and tumor xenograft experiments. Consistently, 
Src SUMOylation leads to a decrease of Y925 phosphorylation of focal adhesion 
kinase (FAK), an established regulatory event of cell migration. Our results 
suggest that SUMOylation of Src at lysine 318 negatively modulate its oncogenic 
function by, at least partially, inhibiting Src-FAK complex activity.
