Congenital isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) type 1b is an autosomal 
recessive genetic condition caused by mutations of growth hormone (GH)-1 or the 
growth hormone releasing hormone receptor (GHRH-R) genes. Affected subjects 
present with symptoms of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) with low but detectable 
levels of growth hormone (GH), short stature and responsiveness to GH therapy. 
We describe a 13-month old girl with severe growth failure who showed a low GH 
response to two GH provocation tests and a modest increase of insulin-like 
growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to an IGF-1 generation test. Whole exome sequencing 
revealed a novel homozygous variant of the GHRH-R gene (c.97C>T), leading to a 
premature stop codon. Administration of recombinant human GH improved linear 
growth. This is the first report of a c.97C>T mutation of the GHRH-R gene.
