Meningioma represents the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Recently 
several non-NF2 mutations in meningioma have been identified and correlated with 
certain pathological subtypes, locations and clinical observations. Alterations 
of cellular pathways due to these mutations, however, have largely remained 
elusive. Here we report that the Krueppel like factor 4 (KLF4)-K409Q mutation in 
skull base meningiomas triggers a distinct tumor phenotype. Transcriptomic 
analysis of 17 meningioma samples revealed that KLF4K409Q mutated tumors harbor 
an upregulation of hypoxia dependent pathways. Detailed in vitro investigation 
further showed that the KLF4K409Q mutation induces HIF-1α through the reduction 
of prolyl hydroxylase activity and causes an upregulation of downstream HIF-1α 
targets. Finally, we demonstrate that KLF4K409Q mutated tumors are susceptible 
to mTOR inhibition by Temsirolimus. Taken together, our data link the KLF4K409Q 
mediated upregulation of HIF pathways to the clinical and biological 
characteristics of these skull base meningiomas possibly opening new therapeutic 
avenues for this distinct meningioma subtype.
