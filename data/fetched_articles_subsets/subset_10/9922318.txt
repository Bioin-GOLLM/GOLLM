BACKGROUND & AIMS: Two mutations have been described in the HFE gene: C282Y and 
H63D. The aim of this study was to determine the phenotype of the different HFE 
genotypes.
METHODS: Clinical symptoms and iron data were examined according to HFE 
genotypes in 531 unrelated patients with unexplained liver iron overload and 579 
relatives of hemochromatotic patients.
RESULTS: Non-C282Y +/+ patients did not markedly differ in terms of iron 
overload or clinical expression according to genotype, except for compound 
heterozygotes, who had slightly increased transferrin saturation. This 
contrasted with the strikingly increased expression in C282Y homozygotes. 
Similar phenotype/genotype correlations were observed in relatives based on 
serum iron test results. Family transmission of iron overload linked to HFE was 
exceptional in non-C282Y +/+ siblings and frequent in C282Y homozygotes.
CONCLUSIONS: Iron overload in patients with the non-C282Y +/+ genotype is mild 
to moderate, strikingly lower than in C282Y homozygotes, and is not influenced 
by HFE genotype, except, to a small extent, for compound heterozygotes. The role 
of H63D mutation therefore seems to be marginal.
