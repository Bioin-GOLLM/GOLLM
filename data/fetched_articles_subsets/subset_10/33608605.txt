Castor (Ricinus communis L) is an ideal model species for sex mechanism studies 
in monoecious angiosperms, due to wide variations in sex expression. Sex 
reversion to monoecy in pistillate lines, along with labile sex expression, 
negatively influences hybrid seed purity. The study focuses on understanding the 
mechanisms of unisexual flower development, sex reversions and sex variations in 
castor, using various genotypes with distinct sex expression pattern. Male and 
female flowers had 8 and 12 developmental stages respectively, were 
morphologically similar till stage 4, with an intermediate bisexual state and 
were intermediate between type 1 and type 2 flowers. Pistil abortion was earlier 
than stamen inhibition. Sex alterations occurred at floral and inflorescence 
level. While sex-reversion was unidirectional towards maleness via bisexual 
stage, at high day temperatures (Tmax > 38 °C), femaleness was restored with 
subsequent drop in temperatures. Temperature existing for 2-3 weeks during 
floral meristem development, influences sexuality of the flower. We report for 
first time that unisexuality is preceded by bisexuality in castor flowers which 
alters with genotype and temperature, and sex reversions as well as high sexual 
polymorphisms in castor are due to alterations in floral developmental pathways. 
Differentially expressed (male-abundant or male-specific) genes Short chain 
dehydrogenase reductase 2a (SDR) and WUSCHEL are possibly involved in sex 
determination of castor.
