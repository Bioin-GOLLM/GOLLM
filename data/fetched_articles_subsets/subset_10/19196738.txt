BACKGROUND: Expression of the antiapoptotic and antiproliferative protein B-cell 
lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) has been repeatedly shown to be associated with better 
locoregional control and patients' survival in oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC). A regulatory (-938C>A) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in 
the inhibitory P2 BCL2 gene promoter generates significantly different BCL2 
promoter activities and has been associated with outcome in different 
malignancies. The aim of the present study was to analyze the possible influence 
of the (-938C>A) SNP on survival of patients suffering from OSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty-three patients with primary OSCC 
were retrospectively investigated. Bcl-2 expression of tumor cells was 
demonstrated by means of immunohistochemistry. Both the Bcl-2 expression and the 
(-938C>A) genotypes were correlated with the patients' survival.
RESULTS: The (-938C>A) SNP was significantly related to Bcl-2 expression (P = 
0.008). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a significant association of the -938 SNP 
with relapse-free (P = 0.0283) and overall survival (P = 0.0247). Multiple Cox 
regression identified the BCL2 (-938CC) genotype as an independent prognostic 
factor for relapse [hazard ratio (HR) 1.898, P = 0.021] as well as for death in 
OSCC patients (HR 1.897, P = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: The (-938C>A) SNP represents a potential novel prognostic marker in 
patients with OSCC that could help to identify a group of patients at high risk 
for relapse and death.
