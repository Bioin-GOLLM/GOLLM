Opioid dependence, a severe addictive disorder and major societal problem, has 
been demonstrated to be moderately heritable. We conducted a genome-wide 
association study in Comorbidity and Trauma Study data comparing 
opioid-dependent daily injectors (N=1167) with opioid misusers who never 
progressed to daily injection (N=161). The strongest associations, observed for 
CNIH3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were confirmed in two independent 
samples, the Yale-Penn genetic studies of opioid, cocaine and alcohol dependence 
and the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment, which both contain 
non-dependent opioid misusers and opioid-dependent individuals. Meta-analyses 
found five genome-wide significant CNIH3 SNPs. The A allele of rs10799590, the 
most highly associated SNP, was robustly protective (P=4.30E-9; odds ratio 0.64 
(95% confidence interval 0.55-0.74)). Epigenetic annotation predicts that this 
SNP is functional in fetal brain. Neuroimaging data from the Duke Neurogenetics 
Study (N=312) provide evidence of this SNP's in vivo functionality; rs10799590 A 
allele carriers displayed significantly greater right amygdala habituation to 
threat-related facial expressions, a phenotype associated with resilience to 
psychopathology. Computational genetic analyses of physical dependence on 
morphine across 23 mouse strains yielded significant correlations for haplotypes 
in CNIH3 and functionally related genes. These convergent findings support CNIH3 
involvement in the pathophysiology of opioid dependence, complementing prior 
studies implicating the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid 
(AMPA) glutamate system.
