Genetic variation linked to lower levels of soluble ST2, a decoy cytokine 
receptor for IL-33, may protect against Alzheimer's disease in female APOEÎµ4 
carriers by increasing microglial plaque removal. This discovery advances our 
understanding of the immune system's role in Alzheimer's disease and underscores 
the importance of sex-specific disease processes.
