Despite emerging interest in gene-environment interaction (GxE) effects, there 
is a dearth of studies evaluating its potential relevance apart from specific 
hypothesized environments and biometrical variance trends. Using a monozygotic 
within-pair approach, we evaluated evidence of G×E for body mass index (BMI), 
depressive symptoms, and cognition (verbal, spatial, attention, working memory, 
perceptual speed) in twin studies from four countries. We also evaluated whether 
APOE is a 'variability gene' across these measures and whether it partly 
represents the 'G' in G×E effects. In all three domains, G×E effects were 
pervasive across country and gender, with small-to-moderate effects. Age-cohort 
trends were generally stable for BMI and depressive symptoms; however, they were 
variable-with both increasing and decreasing age-cohort trends-for different 
cognitive measures. Results also suggested that APOE may represent a 
'variability gene' for depressive symptoms and spatial reasoning, but not for 
BMI or other cognitive measures. Hence, additional genes are salient beyond 
APOE.
