Objective: Radiotherapy is an indispensable approach for lung cancer, especially 
for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high incidence and mortality. 
However, cellular resistance to ionizing radiation often results in failure in 
treatment. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Sirt3 in 
radiotherapy on NSCLC. Materials and Methods: Resected samples from 80 pairs of 
lung cancer was used to prepare tissue array and Sirt3 was stained with 
immunochemical method. Cell survival as well as apoptosis assay were used to 
determine the cellular radiosensitivity. Moreover, DNA damage was evaluated by 
using γ-H2AX foci. Finally, an in situ lung cancer model to test the 
radiosensitivity in vivo. Results: Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) was found upregulated in 
NSCLC cell lines, as well as lung cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. 
Knockdown of Sirt3 significantly increased radiation-induced cell apoptosis, and 
increased cell survival efficacy. In contrast, Sirt3 overexpression promoted 
radioresistance in lung cancer cells. Sirt3 knockdown also aggravated the G2/M 
cell cycle arrest caused by irradiation. Furthermore, Sirt3 was found to be 
critical for the activation of ATM-Chk2 pathway upon irradiation. Finally, our 
in vivo model showed that targeting Sirt3 significantly sensitized lung cancer 
to radiotherapy. Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings identified a 
significant role of Sirt3 in radioresistanct of NSCLC, which provides novel 
mechanism as well as target for radiotherapy.
