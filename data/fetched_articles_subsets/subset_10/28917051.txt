A sizeable fraction of the selenoproteome encodes oxidoreductases possessing a 
thioredoxin fold, a structural motif that is shared among a diverse group of 
enzymes. In these oxidoreductases, the active site is comprised of a cysteine 
and a selenocysteine separated by one to two amino acids. In a subset of these 
selenoproteins, such as human SELENOH, SELENOM, SELENOT, SELENOV, SELENOW, and 
SELENOF, this redox motif is positioned immediately after the first Î²-sheet in a 
short loop, and is essential for interactions with its substrate or partners. 
Here, we describe the preparation of a representative member of this group, 
SELENOM, by selenocysteine-driven expressed protein ligation. The preparation 
employs a peptide bond formation between two protein fragments expressed 
recombinantly in E. coli. This method can be employed to prepare other 
selenoproteins.
