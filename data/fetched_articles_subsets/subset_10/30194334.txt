Early damage to transplanted organs initiates excess inflammation that can cause 
ongoing injury, a leading cause for late graft loss. The endothelial glycocalyx 
modulates immune reactions and chemokine-mediated haptotaxis, potentially 
driving graft loss. In prior work, conditional deficiency of the 
glycocalyx-modifying enzyme N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase-1 (Ndst1f/f 
TekCre+) reduced aortic allograft inflammation. Here we investigated 
modification of heparan sulfate (HS) and chemokine interactions in whole-organ 
renal allografts. Conditional donor allograft Ndst1 deficiency (Ndst1-/-; 
C57Bl/6 background) was compared to systemic treatment with M-T7, a 
broad-spectrum chemokine-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) inhibitor. Early rejection was 
significantly reduced in Ndst1-/- kidneys engrafted into wildtype BALB/c mice 
(Ndst1+/+) and comparable to M-T7 treatment in C57Bl/6 allografts (P < 0.0081). 
M-T7 lost activity in Ndst1-/- allografts, while M-T7 point mutants with 
modified GAG-chemokine binding displayed a range of anti-rejection activity. 
CD3+ T cells (P < 0.0001), HS (P < 0.005) and CXC chemokine staining 
(P < 0.012), gene expression in NFκB and JAK/STAT pathways, and HS and CS 
disaccharide content were significantly altered with reduced rejection. 
Transplant of donor allografts with conditional Ndst1 deficiency exhibit 
significantly reduced acute rejection, comparable to systemic chemokine-GAG 
inhibition. Modified disaccharides in engrafted organs correlate with reduced 
rejection. Altered disaccharides in engrafted organs provide markers for 
rejection with potential to guide new therapeutic approaches in allograft 
rejection.

Conflict of interest statement: For potential COI, we would note that Dr. A. 
Lucas has previously been affiliated with a small Biotechnology company in 
Canada, but that company was not involved in this research and is no longer 
functioning. Dr. Lucas has submitted patents on M-T7 and to Ndst1 modification 
with antisense oligonucleotides to Ndst1 in transplant. We do have older patents 
related to the chemokine modulating protein, M-T7 and have had active research 
grants funded by the American Heart Association as well as NIH funding.
