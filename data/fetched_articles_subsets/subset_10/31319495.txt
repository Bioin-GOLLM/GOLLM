Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that occurs mainly in 
the elderly and presenile life stages. It is estimated that by the year 2050, 
135 million people will be affected by AD worldwide, representing a huge burden 
to society. The pathological hallmarks of AD mainly include intracellular 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) caused by hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, 
formation of extracellular amyloid plaques, and massive neural cell death in the 
affected nervous system. The pathogenesis of AD is very complicated, and recent 
scientific research on AD is mainly concentrated on the cortex and hippocampus. 
Although the spinal cord is a pivotal part of the central nervous system, there 
are a limited number of studies focusing on the spinal cord. As an extension of 
the brain, the spinal cord functions as the bridge between the brain and various 
parts of the body. However, pathological changes in the spinal cord in AD have 
not been comprehensively and systematically studied at present. We here review 
the existing progress on the pathological features of AD in the spinal cord.
