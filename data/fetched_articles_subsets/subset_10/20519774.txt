Werner syndrome is an inherited human progeriod syndrome caused by mutations in 
the gene encoding the Werner Syndrome protein, WRN. It has both 3'-5' DNA 
helicase and exonuclease activities, and is suggested to have roles in many 
aspects of DNA metabolism, including DNA repair and telomere maintenance. The 
DNA-PK complex also functions in both DNA double strand break repair and 
telomere maintenance. Interaction between WRN and the DNA-PK complex has been 
reported in DNA double strand break repair, but their possible cooperation at 
telomeres has not been reported. This study analyzes thein vitro and in vivo 
interaction at the telomere between WRN and DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit of 
DNA-PK. The results show that DNA-PKcs selectively stimulates WRN helicase but 
not WRN exonuclease in vitro, affecting that WRN helicase unwinds and promotes 
the release of the full-length invading strand of a telomere D-loop model 
substrate. In addition, the length of telomeric G-tails decreases in DNA-PKcs 
knockdown cells, and this phenotype is reversed by overexpression of WRN 
helicase. These results suggest that WRN and DNA-PKcs may cooperatively prevent 
G-tail shortening in vivo.
