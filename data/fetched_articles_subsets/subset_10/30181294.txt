Cytokinetic abscission facilitates the irreversible separation of daughter 
cells. This process requires the endosomal-sorting complexes required for 
transport (ESCRT) machinery and is tightly regulated by charged multivesicular 
body protein 4C (CHMP4C), an ESCRT-III subunit that engages the abscission 
checkpoint (NoCut) in response to mitotic problems such as persisting chromatin 
bridges within the midbody. Importantly, a human polymorphism in CHMP4C 
(rs35094336, CHMP4CT232) increases cancer susceptibility. Here, we explain the 
structural and functional basis for this cancer association: The CHMP4CT232 
allele unwinds the C-terminal helix of CHMP4C, impairs binding to the 
early-acting ESCRT factor ALIX, and disrupts the abscission checkpoint. Cells 
expressing CHMP4CT232 exhibit increased levels of DNA damage and are sensitized 
to several conditions that increase chromosome missegregation, including DNA 
replication stress, inhibition of the mitotic checkpoint, and loss of p53. Our 
data demonstrate the biological importance of the abscission checkpoint and 
suggest that dysregulation of abscission by CHMP4CT232 may synergize with 
oncogene-induced mitotic stress to promote genomic instability and 
tumorigenesis.
