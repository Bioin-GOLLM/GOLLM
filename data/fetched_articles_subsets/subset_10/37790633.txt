BACKGROUND: Genetic variants may potentially play a contributing factor in the 
development of diseases. Several genetic disease databases are used in medical 
research and diagnosis but the web applications used to search these databases 
for disease-associated variants have limitations. The application may not be 
able to search for large-scale genetic variants, the results of searches may be 
difficult to interpret and variants mapped from the latest reference genome 
(GRCH38/hg38) may not be supported.
METHODS: In this study, we developed a novel R library called "DisVar" to 
identify disease-associated genetic variants in large-scale individual genomic 
data. This R library is compatible with variants from the latest reference 
genome version. DisVar uses five databases of disease-associated variants. Over 
100 million variants can be simultaneously searched for specific associated 
diseases.
RESULTS: The package was evaluated using 24 Variant Call Format (VCF) files 
(215,054 to 11,346,899 sites) from the 1000 Genomes Project. Disease-associated 
variants were detected in 298,227 hits across all the VCF files, taking a total 
of 63.58 m to complete. The package was also tested on ClinVar's VCF file 
(2,120,558 variants), where 20,657 hits associated with diseases were identified 
with an estimated elapsed time of 45.98 s.
CONCLUSIONS: DisVar can overcome the limitations of existing tools and is a fast 
and effective diagnostic and preventive tool that identifies disease-associated 
variations from large-scale genetic variants against the latest reference 
genome.
