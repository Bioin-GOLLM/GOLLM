In this study, a diabetic kidney disease model was established by placing the 
test rats on a high-sugar/high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin induction. 
Histopathological examination (H&E, Masson, and PASM stain) showed pathological 
changes in the diabetic rat kidneys, in addition to fibrotic symptoms and 
collagen deposition. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses indicated 
that the diabetic condition significantly increased the expressions of fibrotic 
markers including collagen, α-SMA, and fibronectin. The levels of cholesterol, 
triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein were also increased in diabetic kidney 
disease (DKD) rat blood, while the level of high-density lipoprotein was 
decreased. The results of Oil red O staining experiments indicated that the 
kidneys of diabetic rats exhibited appreciable fat deposition, with high 
contents of triglyceride and cholesterol. To inhibit fibrosis and reduce fat 
deposition, low molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF) may be used. Based on PCR and 
western blot analyses, LMWF can regulate the expression levels of important 
lipid metabolism regulators, thereby impeding the development of kidney 
fibrosis. Through the vitro model, it also be indicated that LMWF could inhibit 
fibrosis process through regulating lipid metabolism which induced by palmitic 
acid.
