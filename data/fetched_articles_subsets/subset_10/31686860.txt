During the past decade, immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoints has become an 
important component of the treatment paradigm for numerous malignancies, 
especially PD-1/PD-L1 blockade which was demonstrated to rejuvenate disabled T 
cells in cancer patients to achieve long-term remissions. However, the clinical 
outcome of PD-1/PD-L1 targeted monotherapy against solid malignancies is not 
satisfactory which may be related with the intricate tumor microenvironment. As 
a vital suppressive immunocyte in tumor microenvironment, Tregs are 
characterized by PD-1 and PD-L1 and demonstrated to contribute to the tumor 
progression. The latest studies have suggested that Tregs might be involved in 
the treatment of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and PD-1/PD-L1 axis could influence Treg 
differentiation and function. However, the complicated relationship between 
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and Tregs has not been fully clarified. Here, we explored the 
role of PD-1/PD-L1 axis in Treg development and function, as well as the 
potential mechanisms of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade resistance related with Tregs. 
Meanwhile, we discussed the combination therapy aimed at targeting PD-1/PD-L1 
axis and Tregs, hoping to provide novel insights for the future cancer 
treatment.
