Mitochondrial diabetes (MD) is generally classified as a genetic defect of 
β-cells. The main pathophysiology is insulin secretion failure in pancreatic 
β-cells due to impaired mitochondrial ATP production. However, several reports 
have mentioned the presence of insulin resistance (IR) as a clinical feature of 
MD. As mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the important factors causing IR, we 
need to focus on IR as another pathophysiology of MD. In this special issue, we 
first briefly summarized the insulin signaling and molecular mechanisms of IR. 
Second, we overviewed currently confirmed pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
mutations from the MITOMAP database. The variants causing diabetes were mostly 
point mutations in the transfer RNA (tRNA) of the mitochondrial genome. Third, 
we focused on these variants leading to the recently described "tRNA 
modopathies" and reviewed the clinical features of patients with diabetes. 
Finally, we discussed the pathophysiology of MD caused by mtDNA mutations and 
explored the possible mechanism underlying the development of IR. This review 
should be beneficial to all clinicians involved in diagnostics and therapeutics 
related to diabetes and mitochondrial diseases.
