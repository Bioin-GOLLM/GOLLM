Molecular chaperones, such as the small heat shock proteins (sHsps), maintain 
normal cellular function by controlling protein homeostasis in stress 
conditions. However, sHsps are not only activated in response to environmental 
insults, but also exert developmental and tissue-specific functions that are 
much less known. Here, we show that during normal development the Drosophila 
sHsp CryAB [L(2)efl] is specifically expressed in larval body wall muscles and 
accumulates at the level of Z-bands and around myonuclei. CryAB features a 
conserved actin-binding domain and, when attenuated, leads to clustering of 
myonuclei and an altered pattern of sarcomeric actin and the Z-band-associated 
actin crosslinker Cheerio (filamin). Our data suggest that CryAB and Cheerio 
form a complex essential for muscle integrity: CryAB colocalizes with Cheerio 
and, as revealed by mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 
binds to Cheerio, and the muscle-specific attenuation of cheerio leads to 
CryAB-like sarcomeric phenotypes. Furthermore, muscle-targeted expression of 
CryAB(R120G), which carries a mutation associated with desmin-related myopathy 
(DRM), results in an altered sarcomeric actin pattern, in affected myofibrillar 
integrity and in Z-band breaks, leading to reduced muscle performance and to 
marked cardiac arrhythmia. Taken together, we demonstrate that CryAB ensures 
myofibrillar integrity in Drosophila muscles during development and propose that 
it does so by interacting with the actin crosslinker Cheerio. The evidence that 
a DRM-causing mutation affects CryAB muscle function and leads to DRM-like 
phenotypes in the fly reveals a conserved stress-independent role of CryAB in 
maintaining muscle cell cytoarchitecture.
