Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) is a liver-enriched transcription factor 
that regulates many aspects of hepatocyte functions. Our previous studies have 
demonstrated that HNF1α has potent therapeutic effects on hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). Mutations in HNF1α gene are frequently associated with 
maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) and hepatocellular adenomas. 
However, the association of HNF1α mutation and HCC remains elusive. In this 
study, the point mutation of HNF1α gene with c.A1532 > T/p.Q511L was identified 
in an HCC patient by exon-capture high-throughput sequencing. Mutation of 
c.A1532 > T/p.Q511L in HNF1α gene was only detected in the tumor tissue but not 
in the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissue of the patient. Luciferase reporter 
assay and real-time PCR revealed that mutation of p.Q511L reduced the 
transcriptional activity of HNF1α. Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular 
fraction analysis revealed that mutation of p.Q511L disturbed the intracellular 
localization of HNF1α in HCC cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of HNF1α on 
the proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC cells was also partially 
abolished by the mutation of p.Q511L. Our data suggested that the missense 
mutation of HNF1α (p.Q511L) may associate with the progression of HCC.
