GTPase of immunity-associated protein 5 (Gimap5) is linked with lymphocyte 
survival, autoimmunity, and colitis, but its mechanisms of action are unclear. 
Here, we show that Gimap5 is essential for the inactivation of glycogen synthase 
kinase-3β (GSK3β) following T cell activation. In the absence of Gimap5, 
constitutive GSK3β activity constrains c-Myc induction and NFATc1 nuclear 
import, thereby limiting productive CD4+ T cell proliferation. Additionally, 
Gimap5 facilitates Ser389 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of GSK3β, 
thereby limiting DNA damage in CD4+ T cells. Importantly, pharmacological 
inhibition and genetic targeting of GSK3β can override Gimap5 deficiency in CD4+ 
T cells and ameliorates immunopathology in mice. Finally, we show that a human 
patient with a GIMAP5 loss-of-function mutation has lymphopenia and impaired T 
cell proliferation in vitro that can be rescued with GSK3 inhibitors. Given that 
the expression of Gimap5 is lymphocyte-restricted, we propose that its control 
of GSK3β is an important checkpoint in lymphocyte proliferation.
