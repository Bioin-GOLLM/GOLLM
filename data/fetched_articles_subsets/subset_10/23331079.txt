BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Interleukin (IL)-1β is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine 
that plays a crucial role in the regulation of inflammation and wound healing in 
the cornea. Elucidation of IL-1β signalling may help identify therapeutic 
targets for corneal wound healing; however, mechanisms such as cell migration, a 
component of IL-1β-induced wound healing response in human corneal endothelial 
cells (CEC), have not been well characterised.
RESULTS: Stimulation of human CEC with IL-1β activated expression of fibroblast 
growth factor 2 (FGF2) and resulted in enhanced cell migration. This, in turn, 
was abolished by treatment with either IL-1 receptor antagonist or SU-5402, a 
pan-fibroblast growth factor signalling inhibitor. Phosphatidyl inositol (PI) 
3-kinase or IL receptor-associated kinase 1/4 antagonists demonstrated that IL 
receptor-associated kinase 1/4 activates PI 3-kinase, which in turn 
phosphorylates p38 and inhibitor κB kinase α/β, leading to FGF2 expression 
through activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor 
kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in human CEC. Treatment 
of IL-1β-stimulated human CEC with either AP-1 or NF-κB antagonists decreased 
FGF2 expression and resulted in reduced IL-1β-enhanced cell migration. 
Co-treatment of IL-1β-stimulated human CEC with both inhibitors completely 
blocked FGF2 expression and IL-1β-enhanced cell migration. Chromatin 
immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that AP-1 and NF-κB directly bind to the 
FGF2 promoter following IL-1β stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that binding of IL-1β to its receptor in human CEC 
leads to parallel activation of AP-1 and NF-κB pathways, leading, in turn, to 
FGF2 expression and enhanced cell migration.
