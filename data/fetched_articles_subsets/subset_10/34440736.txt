C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and polymorphisms in CCR5 gene are associated 
with sarcoidosis and Löfgren's syndrome. Löfgren's syndrome is an acute and 
usually self-remitting phenotype of sarcoidosis. We investigated whether the 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1799987 is associated with susceptibility 
for Löfgren's syndrome and has an effect on CCR5 expression on monocytes and 
function of CCR5. A total of 106 patients with Löfgren's syndrome and 257 
controls were genotyped for rs1799987. Expression of CCR5 on monocytes was 
measured by flowcytometry. We evaluated calcium influx kinetics following 
stimulation upon N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and macrophage 
inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) on monocytes by measuring the median 
fluorescence intensity (MFI). The frequency of the G allele of rs1799987 was 
significantly higher in Löfgren's syndrome than in healthy controls (p = 0.0015, 
confidence interval (CI) 1.22-2.32, odds ratio (OR) 1.680). Patients with a GG 
genotype showed higher CCR5 expression on monocytes than patients with the AA 
genotype (p = 0.026). A significantly (p = 0.027) lower count of patients with 
the GG genotype showed a calcium influx reaction to simulation upon MIP-1 α, 
compared with patients with the AA genotype. The rs1799987 G allele in CCR5 gene 
is associated with susceptibility to Löfgren's syndrome and with quantitative 
and qualitative changes in CCR5, potentially effecting the inflammatory 
response.
