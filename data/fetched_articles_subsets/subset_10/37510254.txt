Musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) caused by pathogenic variants 
in CHST14 (mcEDS-CHST14) is a subtype of EDS characterized by multisystem 
malformations and progressive fragility-related manifestations. A recent 
international collaborative study showed that 55% of mcEDS-CHST14 patients had 
hearing loss (HL), more commonly of the high-frequency type. Here, we report the 
first systemic investigation of the otological features of patients with this 
disorder based on the world's largest cohort at Shinshu University Hospital. 
Nine patients [18 ears; four male and five female patients; mean age, 18 years 
old (range, 10-28)] underwent comprehensive otological evaluation: audiogram, 
distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) test, and tympanometry. The 
audiogram, available in all 18 ears, showed HL in eight patients (8/9, 89%) and 
in 14 ears (14/18, 78%): bilateral in six patients (6/9, 67%) and unilateral in 
two (2/9, 22%); mild in eight ears (8/18, 44%) and moderate in six (6/18, 33%); 
and high-frequency HL in five (5/18, 28%) and low-frequency HL in five (5/18, 
28%). An air-bone gap was detected in one ear (1/18, 6%). DPOAE was available in 
13 ears, with the presence of a response in five (5/13, 38%) and the absence in 
eight (8/13, 62%), including in three ears of normal hearing. Tympanometry 
results were available in 12 ears: Ad type in nine (9/12, 75%) and As type in 
one (1/12, 8.3%). Patients with mcEDS-CHST14 had a high prevalence of HL, 
typically sensorineural and bilateral, with mild to moderate severity, of 
high-frequency or low-frequency type, and sometimes with no DPOAE response. The 
pathophysiology underlying HL might be complex, presumably related to 
alterations of the tectorial membrane and/or the basilar membrane of Corti 
associated with disorganized collagen fibril networks. Regular and careful 
check-ups of hearing using multiple modalities are recommended for mcEDS-CHST14 
patients.
