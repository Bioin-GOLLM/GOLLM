Obesity-induced diabetes affects >400 million people worldwide. Uncontrolled 
lipolysis (free fatty acid release from adipocytes) can contribute to diabetes 
and obesity. To identify future therapeutic avenues targeting this pathway, we 
performed a high-throughput screen and identified the extracellular-regulated 
kinase 3 (ERK3) as a hit. We demonstrated that β-adrenergic stimulation 
stabilizes ERK3, leading to the formation of a complex with the cofactor MAP 
kinase-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5), thereby driving lipolysis. 
Mechanistically, we identified a downstream target of the ERK3/MK5 pathway, the 
transcription factor FOXO1, which promotes the expression of the major lipolytic 
enzyme ATGL. Finally, we provide evidence that targeted deletion of ERK3 in 
mouse adipocytes inhibits lipolysis, but elevates energy dissipation, promoting 
lean phenotype and ameliorating diabetes. Thus, ERK3/MK5 represents a previously 
unrecognized signaling axis in adipose tissue and an attractive target for 
future therapies aiming to combat obesity-induced diabetes.
