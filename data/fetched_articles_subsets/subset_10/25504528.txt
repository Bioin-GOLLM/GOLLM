XMEN disease (X-linked immunodeficiency with Magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr 
virus infection and Neoplasia) is a novel primary immune deficiency caused by 
mutations in MAGT1 and characterised by chronic infection with Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV), EBV-driven lymphoma, CD4 T-cell lymphopenia, and 
dysgammaglobulinemia [1]. Functional studies have demonstrated roles for 
magnesium as a second messenger in T-cell receptor signalling [1], and for NKG2D 
expression and consequently NK- and CD8 T-cell cytotoxicity [2]. 7 patients have 
been described in the literature; the oldest died at 45 years and was diagnosed 
posthumously [1-3]. We present the case of a 58-year-old Caucasian gentleman 
with a novel mutation in MAGT1 with the aim of adding to the phenotype of this 
newly described disease by detailing his clinical course over more than 20 
years.
