Somatic mutations that lead to hyperactivation of epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) signaling are detected in approximately 50% of lung 
adenocarcinoma in people from the Far East population and tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors are now the standard first line treatment for advanced disease. They 
have led to a doubling of progression-free survival and an increase in overall 
survival by more than 2 years. However, emergence of resistant clones has become 
the primary cause for treatment failure, and has created a new challenge in the 
daily management of patients with EGFR mutations. Identification of mechanisms 
leading to inhibitor resistance has led to new therapeutic modalities, some of 
which have now been adapted for patients with unsuccessful tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor treatment. In this review, we describe mechanisms of tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor resistance and the available strategies to overcoming resistance.
