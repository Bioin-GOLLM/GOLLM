Soluble human tumor necrosis factor (shTNFRI-Fc) and human heme oxygenase 1 
(hHO-1) are key regulators for protection against oxidative and inflammatory 
injury for xenotransplantation. Somatic cells with more than 10 copy numbers of 
shTNFRI-Fc and hHO-1 were employed in somatic cell nuclear transfer to generate 
cloned pigs, thereby resulting in seven cloned piglets. However, produced 
piglets were all dead within 24 hours after birth. Obviously, postnatal death 
with liver apoptosis was reported in the higher copy number of shTNFRI-Fc and 
hHO-1 piglets. In liver, the transcript levels of ferritin heavy chain, light 
chain, transferrin, and inducible nitric oxide synthase were significantly 
highly expressed compared to those of lower copy number of shTNFRI-Fc and hHO-1 
piglets (P < 0.05). Also, H2O2 contents were increased, and superoxide dismutase 
was significantly lower in the higher copy number of shTNFRI-Fc and hHO-1 
piglets (P < 0.05). These results indicate that TNFRI-Fc and hHO-1 
overexpression may apparently induce free iron in the liver and exert oxidative 
stress by enhancing reactive oxygen species production and block normal 
postneonatal liver metabolism.
