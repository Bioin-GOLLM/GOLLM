Western diet (WD) impairs glucose tolerance and cardiac lipid dynamics, 
preceding heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in mice. Unlike 
diabetic db/db mice with high cardiac triglyceride (TG) and rapid TG turnover, 
WD mice had high TG but slowed turnover, reducing lipolytic PPAR⍺ activation. WD 
deranged cardiac TG dynamics by imbalancing synthesis and lipolysis, with low 
cardiac TG lipase (ATGL), low ATGL co-activator, and high ATGL inhibitory 
peptide. By 24 weeks of WD, hearts shifted from diastolic dysfunction to 
diastolic dysfunction with HFrEF with decreases in GLUT4 and exogenous glucose 
oxidation and elevated β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 without increasing 
ketone oxidation.
