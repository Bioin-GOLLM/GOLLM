Irinotecan (SN-38) is a potent and broad-spectrum anticancer drug that targets 
DNA topoisomerase I (Top1). It exerts its cytotoxic effects by binding to the 
Top1-DNA complex and preventing the re-ligation of the DNA strand, leading to 
the formation of lethal DNA breaks. Following the initial response to 
irinotecan, secondary resistance is acquired relatively rapidly, compromising 
its efficacy. There are several mechanisms contributing to the resistance, which 
affect the irinotecan metabolism or the target protein. In addition, we have 
demonstrated a major resistance mechanism associated with the elimination of 
hundreds of thousands of Top1 binding sites on DNA that can arise from the 
repair of prior Top1-dependent DNA cleavages. Here, we outline the major 
mechanisms of irinotecan resistance and highlight recent advancements in the 
field. We discuss the impact of resistance mechanisms on clinical outcomes and 
the potential strategies to overcome resistance to irinotecan. The elucidation 
of the underlying mechanisms of irinotecan resistance can provide valuable 
insights for the development of effective therapeutic strategies.
