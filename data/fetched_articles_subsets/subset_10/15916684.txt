Broad cross-talk exists between the endocrine and immune systems. Estrogen 
receptor expression in lymphocytes suggests that hormonal modulation may 
influence lymphoma risk. Analysis of genetic polymorphisms that affect oestrogen 
production, such as cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) -34T>C, may provide insight 
into oestrogen's role in lymphomagenesis. CYP17A1-34T>C and CYP17A1 IVS2 105A>C 
polymorphisms were analyzed in a non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) population-based 
case-control study. The CYP17A1-34CC genotype was positively associated with NHL 
[odds ratio (OR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.03], particularly 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR = 1.76, CI 1.14-2.71). Associations of CYP17A1 
polymorphisms with increased risk of NHL suggest a role for oestrogen in 
lymphomagenesis.
