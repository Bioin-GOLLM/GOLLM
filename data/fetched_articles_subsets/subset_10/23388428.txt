BACKGROUND: We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 
integrin beta 1 (ITGB1) and integrin beta 2 (ITGB2) contribute to the 
development of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).
METHODS: Two synonymous SNPs (rs2230396 and rs2298141) of ITGB1 and 1 synonymous 
SNP (rs2352326), 1 5' URT-region SNP (rs2070947), and 1 promoter SNP (rs2070946) 
of ITGB2 SNPs were genotyped using direct sequencing in 94 patients with PTC and 
213 healthy controls. Genetic data were analyzed using SNPStats 
(http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats), Helix Tree (Golden Helix Inc, 
Bozeman, MT), and SNPAnalyzer (ISTECH Corp, Goyang City, Republic of Korea).
RESULTS: The promoter SNP (rs2070946) of ITGB2 was significantly associated with 
the development of PTC (dominant model, log-additive model). The G allele 
frequencies of the promoter SNP (rs2070946) of ITBG2 in patients with PTC 
(19.9%) were increased by about 2-fold compared with controls (10.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a promoter SNP (rs2070946) of ITGB2 might 
be associated with a risk of PTC.
