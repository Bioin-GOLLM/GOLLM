Inhibition of viral pathogenesis and promotion of the septic shock response to 
bacterial infection by IRF-3 are regulated by the acetylation and 
phosphorylation of its coactivators.

Interferon (IFN) is required for protecting mice from viral pathogenesis; 
reciprocally, it mediates the deleterious septic shock response to bacterial 
infection. The critical transcription factor for IFN induction, in both cases, 
is IRF-3, which is activated by TLR3 or RIG-I signaling in response to virus 
infection and TLR4 signaling in response to bacterial infection. Here, we report 
that IRF-3's transcriptional activity required its coactivators, β-catenin and 
CBP, to be modified by HDAC6-mediated deacetylation and protein kinase C isozyme 
β (PKC-β)-mediated phosphorylation, respectively, so that activated nuclear 
IRF-3 could form a stable transcription initiation complex at the target gene 
promoters. β-Catenin bridges IRF-3 and CBP, and the modifications were required 
specifically for the interaction between β-catenin and CBP but not β-catenin and 
IRF-3. Consequently, like IRF-3(-/-) mice, HDAC6(-/-) mice were resistant to 
bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Conversely, they were highly 
susceptible to pathogenesis caused by Sendai virus infection. Thus, HDAC6 is an 
essential component of the innate immune response to microbial infection.
