Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology defined by the presence of 
noncaseating granulomatous inflammation that can cause organ damage and 
diminished quality of life. Treatment is indicated to protect organ function and 
decrease symptomatic burden. Current treatment options focus on interruption of 
granuloma formation and propagation. Clinical trials guiding evidence for 
treatment are lacking due to the rarity of disease, heterogeneous clinical 
course, and lack of prognostic biomarkers, all of which contribute to difficulty 
in clinical trial design and implementation. In this review, a multidisciplinary 
treatment approach is summarized, addressing immunuosuppressive drugs, managing 
complications of chronic granulomatous inflammation, and assessing treatment 
toxicity. Discovery of new therapies will depend on research into pathogenesis 
of antigen presentation and granulomatous inflammation. Future treatment 
approaches may also include personalized decisions based on pharmacogenomics and 
sarcoidosis phenotype, as well as patient-centered approaches to manage 
immunosuppression, symptom control, and treatment of comorbid conditions.
