The asymmetric unit of the title compound, C(21)H(20)N(4)O(3)S, contains two 
independent mol-ecules. The dihedral angles between the two benzene rings are 
47.6 (1) and 30.2 (1)°, the corresponding values between the p-methoxy-benzene 
and thia-diazol rings are 12.3 (1) and 24.7 (1)°, respectively, for the two 
mol-ecules. The conformations of the N-H and C=O bonds are anti with respect to 
each other. The enone groups show a trans configuration. The crystal structure 
is stabilized by N-H⋯O and N-H⋯N inter-actions. The absolute structure could not 
be determined from the X-ray data but the absolute configuration has been 
assigned by reference to an unchanging chiral centre in the synthetic procedure.
