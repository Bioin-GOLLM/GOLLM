Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations identify patients with lung 
cancer who derive benefit from kinase inhibitors. However, most patients 
eventually develop resistance, primarily due to the T790M second-site mutation. 
Irreversible inhibitors (e.g., osimertinib/AZD9291) inhibit T790M-EGFR, but 
several mechanisms, including a third-site mutation, C797S, confer renewed 
resistance. We previously reported that a triple mixture of monoclonal 
antibodies, 3×mAbs, simultaneously targeting EGFR, HER2, and HER3, inhibits 
T790M-expressing tumors. We now report that 3×mAbs, including a triplet 
containing cetuximab and trastuzumab, inhibits C797S-expressing tumors. Unlike 
osimertinib, which induces apoptosis, 3×mAbs promotes degradation of the three 
receptors and induces cellular senescence. Consistent with distinct mechanisms, 
treatments combining 3×mAbs plus sub-inhibitory doses of osimertinib 
synergistically and persistently eliminated tumors. Thus, oligoclonal 
antibodies, either alone or in combination with kinase inhibitors, might preempt 
repeated cycles of treatment and rapid emergence of resistance.
