Increases in non-communicable and auto-immune diseases, with a shared etiology 
of defective autophagy and chronic inflammation, have motivated research both on 
natural products in drug discovery fields and on the interrelationship between 
autophagy and inflammation. Within this framework, the tolerability and 
protective effects of a wheat-germ spermidine (SPD) and clove eugenol (EUG) 
combination supplement (SUPPL) were investigated on inflammation status (after 
the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) and on autophagy using human 
Caco-2 and NCM460 cell lines. In comparison to the LPS treatment alone, the 
SUPPL + LPS significantly attenuated ROS levels and midkine expression in 
monocultures, as well as occludin expression and mucus production in 
reconstituted intestinal equivalents. Over a timeline of 2-4 h, the SUPPL and 
SUPPL + LPS treatments stimulated autophagy LC3-11 steady state expression and 
turnover, as well as P62 turnover. After completely blocking autophagy with 
dorsomorphin, inflammatory midkine was significantly reduced in the SUPPL + LPS 
treatment in a non-autophagy-dependent manner. After a 24 h timeline, 
preliminary results showed that mitophagy receptor BNIP3L expression was 
significantly downregulated in the SUPPL + LPS treatment compared to the LPS 
alone, whereas conventional autophagy protein expression was significantly 
higher. The SUPPL shows promise in reducing inflammation and increasing 
autophagy to improve intestinal health.
