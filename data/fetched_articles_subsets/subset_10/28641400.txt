Protein-based methods of siRNA delivery are capable of uniquely specific 
targeting, but are limited by technical challenges such as low potency or poor 
biophysical properties. Here, we engineered a series of ultra-high affinity 
siRNA binders based on the viral protein p19 and developed them into siRNA 
carriers targeted to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Combined in 
trans with a previously described endosome-disrupting agent composed of the 
pore-forming protein Perfringolysin O (PFO), potent silencing was achieved in 
vitro with no detectable cytotoxicity. Despite concerns that excessively strong 
siRNA binding could prevent the discharge of siRNA from its carrier, higher 
affinity continually led to stronger silencing. We found that this improvement 
was due to both increased uptake of siRNA into the cell and improved 
pharmacodynamics inside the cell. Mathematical modeling predicted the existence 
of an affinity optimum that maximizes silencing, after which siRNA sequestration 
decreases potency. Our study characterizing the affinity dependence of silencing 
suggests that siRNA-carrier affinity can significantly affect the intracellular 
fate of siRNA and may serve as a handle for improving the efficiency of 
delivery. The two-agent delivery system presented here possesses notable 
biophysical properties and potency, and provide a platform for the cytosolic 
delivery of nucleic acids.
