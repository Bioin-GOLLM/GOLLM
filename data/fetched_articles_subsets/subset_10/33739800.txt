OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to assess the correlation between LH, LHR, GDF9, 
FSHR, AMH, AMHR2, and BMP15 polymorphisms, which are related to follicular 
development, and decreased ovarian response in women undergoing controlled 
ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for IVF.
METHODS: This age-matched case-control study included three or four controls per 
woman undergoing COH. Controls were women with normal ovarian response (NOR) and 
cases were women with poor ovarian response (POR) in oocyte retrieval (three or 
fewer oocytes). DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and potential 
associations with gene polymorphisms related to follicular development (LH, LHR, 
GDF9, FSHR, AMH, AMHR2, and BMP15) were analyzed.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were included, 52 in the NOR and 14 in the POR 
group. Two GDF9 polymorphisms were associated with follicular response after 
COH, one associated with POR - the presence of a mutant polymorphism in 
heterozygosis and homozygosis of the GDF9 398-39 (C to G) [23% NOR versus 68% 
POR (OR 4.01, CI 1.52-10.6, p=0.005)] - and another associated with protective 
response - the presence of normal homozygosis of GDF9 (C447T) [19.2% NOR versus 
50% POR (OR 0.34, IC 0.14-0.84, p=0.019)]. No additional associations were found 
between the other analyzed polymorphisms and POR.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that GDF9 appears to play an important role in 
follicular development, whereas polymorphisms in its DNA chain may negatively 
affect ovarian reserve, such as 398-39 (C to G), or positively, as seen in 
C447T.
