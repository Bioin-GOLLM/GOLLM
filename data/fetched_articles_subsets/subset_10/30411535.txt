BACKGROUND: Filamin C (FLNC) mutation was reported as a cause of HCM, with a 
high probability of sudden cardiac death. However, the mutation profile of FLNC, 
and its relationship with phenotypic expression in HCM, remains to be 
elucidated.
METHODS: In this study, FLNC gene was sequenced in 540 HCM patients and 307 
healthy controls.
RESULTS: We found that 39 (7.2%) patients carried FLNC mutations, with a similar 
frequency to that of controls (4.2%, p = 0.101). Pedigree analysis showed that 
mutations were not well segregated with HCM. The baseline characteristics 
between HCM patients, with and without mutations, were comparable. FLNC 
mutations did not increase the risk for either all-cause mortality (HR 0.746, 
95% CI 0.222-2.295, p = 0.575) or cardiac mortality (HR 0.615, 95% CI 
0.153-1.947, p = 0.354) in HCM patients during a follow-up of 4.7 ± 3.2 years. 
Moreover, there was no significant difference in survival free from sudden 
cardiac arrest (HR 0.721, 95% CI 0.128-3.667, p = 0.660) and heart failure (HR 
0.757, 95% CI 0.318-1.642, p = 0.447).
CONCLUSIONS: FLNC mutations were common in both HCM patients and healthy 
population. The pathogenicity of FLNC mutations detected in HCM patients and its 
association with the clinical outcomes should be cautiously interpreted.
