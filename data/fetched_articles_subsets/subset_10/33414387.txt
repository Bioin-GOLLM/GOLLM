As one of the most successful therapeutic target families, G protein-coupled 
receptors (GPCRs) have experienced a transformation from random ligand screening 
to knowledge-driven drug design. We are eye-witnessing tremendous progresses 
made recently in the understanding of their structure-function relationships 
that facilitated drug development at an unprecedented pace. This article intends 
to provide a comprehensive overview of this important field to a broader 
readership that shares some common interests in drug discovery.
