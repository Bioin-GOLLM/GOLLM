HOTAIR is a well-known long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) involved in various cellular 
signaling, whereas its functional impacts on endometriosis development are still 
largely unknown. To this end, six potential functional single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in HOTAIR, with minor allele frequencies more than 10% in 
Han population and altered net energy of RNA structures larger than 0.5 
kcal/mol, were selected for genotyping study. The study included 207 
endometriosis patients and 200 healthy women. Genetic substitutions at rs1838169 
and rs17720428 were frequently found in endometriosis patients, and rs1838169 
showed statistical significance (p = 0.0174). The G-G (rs1838169-rs17720428) 
haplotype showed the most significant association with endometriosis (p < 
0.0001) with enhanced HOTAIR stability, and patients who harbor such haplotype 
tended to show higher CA125. Data mining further revealed higher mRNA HOTAIR 
levels in the endometria of patients with severe endometriosis which 
consistently showed reduced HOXD10 and HOXA5 levels. HOTAIR knockdown with 
specific shRNAs down-regulated cell proliferation and migration with the 
induction of HOXD10 and HOXA5 expression in human ovarian clear cancer cells. 
Our study therefore provided evidence to indicate a prominent role of HOTAIR in 
promoting endometriosis, which could be used as a potential target for clinical 
applications.
