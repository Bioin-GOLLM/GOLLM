Substitutions in the amino-proximal region of wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) 
HC-Pro were evaluated for effects on transmission by the wheat curl mite (Aceria 
tosichella Keifer). Alanine substitution at cysteine residues 16, 46 and 49 
abolished vector transmission. Although alanine substitution at Cys(20) had no 
effect, substitution with arginine reduced vector transmission efficiency. 
Random substitutions at other positions (Lys(7) to Asn, Asn(19) to Ile, and 
Arg(45) to Lys) did not affect vector transmission. These results suggest that a 
zinc-finger-like motif (His(13)-X2-Cys(16)-X29-Cys(46)-X2-Cys(49)) in WSMV 
HC-Pro is essential for vector transmission.
