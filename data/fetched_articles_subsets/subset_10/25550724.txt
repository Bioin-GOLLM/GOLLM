The study of 1:1 cyclodextrin inclusion compounds by isothermal titration 
calorimetry was explored in a theoretical and experimental point of view to 
compare the efficiency of conventional and non-conventional experiments. All 
direct and competitive protocols were described and evaluated in terms of 
accuracy on both binding constant and inclusion enthalpy. Significant 
improvement in the calorimetric characterization may be obtained by means of the 
global analysis of non-conventional experiments coupled to the standard 
titration protocol. While the titration-release approach proved to be the most 
accurate strategy for classical complexations, the valuable contribution of 
other non-conventional experiments was demonstrated for issues concerning weak 
stability, enthalpy, or solubility.
