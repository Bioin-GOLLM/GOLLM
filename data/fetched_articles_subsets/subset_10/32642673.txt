BACKGROUND: The median survival for patients with glioblastoma (GBM), the most 
common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, has remained approximately 1 
year for more than 2 decades. Recent advances in the field have identified GBM 
as a sexually dimorphic disease. It is less prevalent in females and they have 
better survival compared to males. The molecular mechanism of this difference 
has not yet been established. Iron is essential for many biological processes 
supporting tumor growth and its regulation is impacted by sex. Therefore, we 
interrogated the expression of a key component of cellular iron regulation, the 
HFE (homeostatic iron regulatory) gene, on sexually dimorphic survival in GBM.
METHODS: We analyzed TCGA microarray gene expression and clinical data of all 
primary GBM patients (IDH-wild type) to compare tumor mRNA expression of HFE 
with overall survival, stratified by sex.
RESULTS: In low HFE expressing tumors (below median expression, n = 220), 
survival is modulated by both sex and MGMT status, with the combination of 
female sex and MGMT methylation resulting in over a 10-month survival advantage 
(P < .0001) over the other groups. Alternatively, expression of HFE above the 
median (high HFE, n = 240) is associated with significantly worse overall 
survival in GBM, regardless of MGMT methylation status or patient sex. Gene 
expression analysis uncovered a correlation between high HFE expression and 
expression of genes associated with immune function.
CONCLUSIONS: The level of HFE expression in GBM has a sexually dimorphic impact 
on survival. Whereas HFE expression below the median imparts a survival benefit 
to females, high HFE expression is associated with significantly worse overall 
survival regardless of established prognostic factors such as sex or MGMT 
methylation.
