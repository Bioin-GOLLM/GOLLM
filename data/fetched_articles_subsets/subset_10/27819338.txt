Intracerebral injection of the excitotoxic, endogenous tryptophan metabolite, 
quinolinic acid (QA), constitutes a chemical model of neurodegenerative brain 
disease. Complementary techniques were combined to examine the consequences of 
QA injection into medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of C57BL6 mice. In accordance 
with the NMDAR-mediated synapto- and neurotoxic action of QA, we found an 
initial increase in excitability and an augmentation of hippocampal long-term 
potentiation, converting within two weeks into a reduction and impairment, 
respectively, of these processes. QA-induced mPFC excitotoxicity impaired 
behavioral flexibility in a reversal variant of the hidden-platform Morris water 
maze (MWM), whereas regular, extended MWM training was unaffected. QA-induced 
mPFC damage specifically affected the spatial-cognitive strategies that mice use 
to locate the platform during reversal learning. These behavioral and cognitive 
defects coincided with changes in cortical functional connectivity (FC) and 
hippocampal neuroplasticity. FC between various cortical regions was assessed by 
resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) methodology, and mice that had received QA injection 
into mPFC showed increased FC between various cortical regions. mPFC and 
hippocampus (HC) are anatomically as well as functionally linked as part of a 
cortical network that controls higher-order cognitive functions. Together, these 
observations demonstrate the central functional importance of rodent mPFC as 
well as the validity of QA-induced mPFC damage as a preclinical rodent model of 
the early stages of neurodegeneration.
