CONTEXT: Estrogen resistance due to mutations in the estrogen receptor α gene 
(ESR1) has been described in men and women and is characterized by osteoporosis, 
delayed bone age and continuous growth in adulthood, and delayed puberty and 
multiple ovarian cysts in women. Although mutations in the estrogen receptor β 
gene ESR2 were found in 46, XY patients with differences of sex development, no 
genetic variants of ESR2 were linked to gonadal defects in women.
SETTINGS AND PATIENT: Here we describe a 16-year-old female patient who came to 
our tertiary care hospital with complete lack of estrogen action, as 
demonstrated by absent breast development, primary amenorrhea, and osteoporosis, 
resembling patients with ESR1 mutation. However, her gonads were clearly 
abnormal (streak), a finding not observed in ESR1-deficient patients.
DESIGN: To gain insights into the molecular consequences of the ESR2 defect, 
whole exome sequencing and extensive functional transactivation studies in 
ovarian, bone, and breast cells were conducted, with or without the natural 
activator of estrogen receptors, 17β-estradiol.
RESULTS: We identified a loss-of-function heterozygous mutation of a highly 
conserved residue in ESR2 that disrupts estradiol-dependent signaling and has a 
dominant negative effect, most likely due to failure to interact with its 
coactivator, nuclear coactivator 1.
CONCLUSIONS: This is a report of a loss-of-function mutation in the estrogen 
receptor β in a young woman with complete ovarian failure, suggesting that ESR2 
is necessary for human ovarian determination and/or maintenance and that ESR1 is 
not sufficient to sustain ovarian function in humans.
