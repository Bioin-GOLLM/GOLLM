Methionine overproduction by Saccharomycopsis lipolytica.

Morzycka E, Sawnor-Korszyńska D, Paszewski A, Grabski J, Raczyńska-Bojanowska K.

Six ethionine-resistant (Etr) regulatory mutants of Saccharomycopsis lipolytica 
Sl/1 overproducing methionine have been isolated. Five of them are also 
resistant to seleno-methionine. The activity of homocysteine synthase 
(O-acetyl-L-hormoserine-acetate lyase, adding hydrogen sulfide) is derepressed 
in these mutants and is not susceptible to the methionine-mediated repression. 
The pool of free methionine in Etr mutants is enhanced 1.5 to 18 times, and 
incorporation of 35S into methionine is 1.5 to 50 times higher than that in the 
wild strain. Neither accumulation of endogenous free methionine in Etr mutants 
nor the uptake of exogenous methionine is accompanied by an increase in the 
S-adenosylmethionine pool. This implies compartmentation of methionine 
metabolism in S. lipolytica.
