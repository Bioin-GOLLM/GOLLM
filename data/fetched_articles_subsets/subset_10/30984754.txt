The approach of providing an oxygenic photosynthetic organism with a cyclic 
electron transfer system, i.e., a far-red light-driven proton pump, is widely 
proposed to maximize photosynthetic efficiency via expanding the absorption 
spectrum of photosynthetically active radiation. As a first step in this 
approach, Gloeobacter rhodopsin was expressed in a PSI-deletion strain of 
Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Functional expression of Gloeobacter rhodopsin, in 
contrast to Proteorhodopsin, did not stimulate the rate of photoheterotrophic 
growth of this Synechocystis strain, analyzed with growth rate measurements and 
competition experiments. Nevertheless, analysis of oxygen uptake and-production 
rates of the Gloeobacter rhodopsin-expressing strains, relative to the ΔPSI 
control strain, confirm that the proton-pumping Gloeobacter rhodopsin provides 
the cells with additional capacity to generate proton motive force. 
Significantly, expression of the Gloeobacter rhodopsin did modulate levels of 
pigment formation in the transgenic strain.
