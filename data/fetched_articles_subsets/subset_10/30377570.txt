Efforts to reduce immunosuppression in the solid tumor microenvironment by 
blocking the recruitment or polarization of tumor associated macrophages (TAM), 
or myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), have gained momentum in recent 
years. Expanding our knowledge of the immune cell types, cytokines, or 
recruitment factors that are associated with high-grade disease, both within the 
tumor and in circulation, is critical to identifying novel targets for 
immunotherapy. Furthermore, a better understanding of how therapeutic regimens, 
such as Dexamethasone (Dex), chemotherapy, and radiation, impact these factors 
will facilitate the design of therapies that can be targeted to the appropriate 
populations and retain efficacy when administered in combination with standard 
of care regimens. Here we perform quantitative analysis of tissue microarrays 
made of samples taken from grades I-III astrocytoma and glioblastoma (GBM, grade 
IV astrocytoma) to evaluate infiltration of myeloid markers CD163, CD68, CD33, 
and S100A9. Serum, flow cytometric, and Nanostring analysis allowed us to 
further elucidate the impact of Dex treatment on systemic biomarkers, 
circulating cells, and functional markers within tumor tissue. We found that 
common myeloid markers were elevated in Dex-treated grade I astrocytoma and GBM 
compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue and grade II-III astrocytomas. Cell 
frequencies in these samples differed significantly from those in Dex-na√Øve 
patients in a pattern that depended on tumor grade. In contrast, observed 
changes in serum chemokines or circulating monocytes were independent of disease 
state and were due to Dex treatment alone. Furthermore, these changes seen in 
blood were often not reflected within the tumor tissue. Conclusions: Our 
findings highlight the importance of considering perioperative treatment as well 
as disease grade when assessing novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers of 
disease.
