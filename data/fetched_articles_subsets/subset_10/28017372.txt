Early B cell factor 3 (EBF3) is a member of the highly evolutionarily conserved 
Collier/Olf/EBF (COE) family of transcription factors. Prior studies on 
invertebrate and vertebrate animals have shown that EBF3 homologs are essential 
for survival and that loss-of-function mutations are associated with a range of 
nervous system developmental defects, including perturbation of neuronal 
development and migration. Interestingly, aristaless-related homeobox (ARX), a 
homeobox-containing transcription factor critical for the regulation of nervous 
system development, transcriptionally represses EBF3 expression. However, human 
neurodevelopmental disorders related to EBF3 have not been reported. Here, we 
describe three individuals who are affected by global developmental delay, 
intellectual disability, and expressive speech disorder and carry de novo 
variants in EBF3. Associated features seen in these individuals include 
congenital hypotonia, structural CNS malformations, ataxia, and genitourinary 
abnormalities. The de novo variants affect a single conserved residue in a zinc 
finger motif crucial for DNA binding and are deleterious in a fly model. Our 
findings indicate that mutations in EBF3 cause a genetic neurodevelopmental 
syndrome and suggest that loss of EBF3 function might mediate a subset of 
neurologic phenotypes shared by ARX-related disorders, including intellectual 
disability, abnormal genitalia, and structural CNS malformations.
