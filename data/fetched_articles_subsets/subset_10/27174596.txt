Mutations in ESR1 have been associated with resistance to aromatase inhibitor 
(AI) therapy in patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer. Little is known of 
the impact of these mutations in patients receiving selective oestrogen receptor 
degrader (SERD) therapy. In this study, hotspot mutations in ESR1 and PIK3CA 
from ctDNA were assayed in clinical trial samples from ER+ metastatic breast 
cancer patients randomized either to the SERD fulvestrant or fulvestrant plus a 
pan-PI3K inhibitor. ESR1 mutations are present in 37% of baseline samples and 
are enriched in patients with luminal A and PIK3CA-mutated tumours. ESR1 
mutations are often polyclonal and longitudinal analysis shows distinct clones 
exhibiting divergent behaviour over time. ESR1 mutation allele frequency does 
not show a consistent pattern of increases during fulvestrant treatment, and 
progression-free survival is not different in patients with ESR1 mutations 
compared with wild-type patients. ESR1 mutations are not associated with 
clinical resistance to fulvestrant in this study.
