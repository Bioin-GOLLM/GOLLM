BACKGROUND: The incidence of endometrial cancer (EC) is still rising. Numerous 
risk factors including patient characteristics and molecular instability have 
been identified for EC. The presence of specific molecular markers allows 
specific diagnostic and prognostic approaches. Several single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified to influence endometrial cancer risk. 
Metalloestrogens are metal ions which can mimic estrogen activity; however, 
their role in uterine pathologies remains unknown. This study aimed to 
investigate total blood trace elements levels and evaluate the distribution of 
selected genotypes in GSTP1 and SLC11A2 genes.
METHODS: This retrospective case-control analysis was carried out in peripheral 
blood samples of 110 women with endometrial cancer (EC; n = 21), uterine fibroma 
(n = 25), endometrial polyp (n = 48), and normal endometrium (n = 16). Analysis 
included measurement of metals and phosphor in serum, and of genetic 
polymorphisms in GST (rs1695) and SLC11A2 (rs224589) in DNA from white blood 
cells. Serum trace elements were measured using ICP-OES spectrometry. SNPs were 
identified using Taq Man real-time PCR genotyping assays.
RESULTS: The study confirmed higher age (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.69-2.24), 
post-menopausal status (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.36-1.94), and diabetes type 2 (OR 
1.54; 95% CI 0.97-1.72) as independent risk factors for EC. We also found a high 
level of Cd (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.31-1.63) and a low level of Co (OR 0.76; 95% CI 
0.53-0.59) to be independent risk factors of EC. None of the tested 
polymorphisms of GSTP1 and SLC11A2 were associated with EC risk. However, high 
Cd (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.15-1.29) and Ni (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05-1.18) serum levels 
were significantly associated with a SLC1A2 TG genotype, and high Cd levels with 
GSTP1 (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.13).
