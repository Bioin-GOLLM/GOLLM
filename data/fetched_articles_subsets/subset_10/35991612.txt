Cancer is still a global public health problem. Although remarkable success has 
been achieved in cancer diagnosis and treatment, the high recurrence and 
mortality rates remain severely threatening to human lives and health. In recent 
years, peptide nanomedicines with precise selectivity and high biocompatibility 
have attracted intense attention in biomedical applications. In particular, 
there has been a significant increase in the exploration of peptides and their 
derivatives for malignant tumor therapy and diagnosis. Herein, we review the 
applications of peptides and their derivatives in the diagnosis and treatment of 
bladder cancer, providing new insights for the design and development of novel 
peptide nanomedicines for the treatment of bladder cancer in the future.
