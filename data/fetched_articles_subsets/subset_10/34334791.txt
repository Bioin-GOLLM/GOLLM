Emerging evidence suggests that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) represents 
a vital and ubiquitous phenomenon underlying the formation of membraneless 
organelles in eukaryotic cells (also known as biomolecular condensates or 
droplets). Recent studies have revealed evidences that indicate that LLPS plays 
a vital role in human health and diseases. In this review, we describe our 
current understanding of LLPS and summarize its physiological functions. We 
further describe the role of LLPS in the development of human diseases. 
Additionally, we review the recently developed methods for studying LLPS. 
Although LLPS research is in its infancy-but is fast-growing-it is clear that 
LLPS plays an essential role in the development of pathophysiological 
conditions. This highlights the need for an overview of the recent advances in 
the field to translate our current knowledge regarding LLPS into therapeutic 
discoveries.
