BACKGROUND: Cellular adhesion mediated by cardiac desmosomes is a prerequisite 
for proper electric propagation mediated by gap junctions in the myocardium. 
However, the molecular principles underlying this interdependence are not fully 
understood.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine potential causes of right 
ventricular conduction abnormalities in a patient with borderline diagnosis of 
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
METHODS: To assess molecular changes, the patient's myocardial tissue was 
analyzed for altered desmosomal and gap junction (connexin43) protein levels and 
localization. In vitro functional studies were performed to characterize the 
consequences of the desmosomal mutations.
RESULTS: Loss of plakoglobin signal was evident at the cell junctions despite 
expression of the protein at control levels. Although the distribution of 
connexin43 was not altered, total protein levels were reduced and changes in 
phosphorylation were observed. The truncation mutant in desmocollin-2a is 
deficient in binding plakoglobin. Moreover, the ability of desmocollin-2a to 
directly interact with connexin43 was abolished by the mutation. No pathogenic 
potential of the desmoglein-2 missense change was identified.
CONCLUSION: The observed abnormalities in gap junction protein expression and 
phosphorylation, which precede an overt cardiac phenotype, likely are 
responsible for slow myocardial conduction in this patient. At the molecular 
level, altered binding properties of the desmocollin-2a mutant may contribute to 
the changes in connexin43. In particular, the newly identified interaction 
between the desmocollin-2a isoform and connexin43 provides novel insights into 
the molecular link between desmosomes and gap junctions.
