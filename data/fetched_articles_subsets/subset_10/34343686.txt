BACKGROUND: Meningioma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. In 
recent years, several non-neurofibromin 2 mutations, i.e., AKT1, SMO, TRAF7, and 
KLF4 mutations, specific for meningioma have been identified. This study aims to 
analyze the clinical impact and imaging characteristics of the KLF4K409Q 
mutation in meningioma.
METHODS: Clinical, neuropathologic, and imaging data of 170 patients who 
underwent meningioma resection between 2013 and 2018 were retrospectively 
collected and tumors were analyzed for the presence of the KLF4K409Q mutation. 
We collected imaging characteristics, performed volumetric analysis of tumor 
size and peritumoral edema (PTBE), and calculated the edema index (EI, i.e., 
ratio of PTBE to tumor volume). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis 
was performed to identify cut-off EI values to predict the mutational status of 
KLF4.
RESULTS: Eighteen (10.6%) of the meningiomas carried the KLF4K409Q mutation; 
these were significantly associated with a secretory subtype (P < 0.001) and 
sphenoid wing location (P = 0.029). Smaller tumor size (P = 0.007), an increased 
PTBE (P = 0.012), and an increased EI (P = 0.001) proved to be significantly 
associated with the KLF4K409Q mutation. In receiver operating characteristic 
curve analysis, EI predicted the KLF4K409Q mutation with an area under the curve 
of 0.728 (P = 0.0016).
CONCLUSIONS: The KLF4K409Q mutation is associated with a distinct small tumor 
subtype, prone to substantial PTBE. EI is a reliable parameter to predict the 
KLF4K409Q mutation in meningioma, thus providing a tool for improvement of pre- 
and perioperative medical management.
