The application of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection 
has constituted a determinant resource to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 
the beginning of 2021, millions of doses have been administered in several 
countries of North and South America and Europe. Many studies have confirmed the 
efficacy of these vaccines in a wide range of ages and in vulnerable groups of 
people against COVID-19. Nevertheless, the emergence and selection of new 
variants have led to a progressive decay in vaccine efficacy. Pfizer-BioNTech 
and Moderna developed updated bivalent vaccines-Comirnaty and Spikevax-to 
improve responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants. Frequent booster 
doses with monovalent or bivalent mRNA vaccines, the emergence of some rare but 
serious adverse events and the activation of T-helper 17 responses suggest the 
need for improved mRNA vaccine formulations or the use of other types of 
vaccines. In this review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of mRNA 
vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 focusing on the most recent, related publications.
