The muscleblind-like (Mbnl) family of RNA-binding proteins plays important roles 
in muscle and eye development and in myotonic dystrophy (DM), in which expanded 
CUG or CCUG repeats functionally deplete Mbnl proteins. We identified 
transcriptome-wide functional and biophysical targets of Mbnl proteins in brain, 
heart, muscle, and myoblasts by using RNA-seq and CLIP-seq approaches. This 
analysis identified several hundred splicing events whose regulation depended on 
Mbnl function in a pattern indicating functional interchangeability between 
Mbnl1 and Mbnl2. A nucleotide resolution RNA map associated repression or 
activation of exon splicing with Mbnl binding near either 3' splice site or near 
the downstream 5' splice site, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis of 
subcellular compartments uncovered a global role for Mbnls in regulating 
localization of mRNAs in both mouse and Drosophila cells, and Mbnl-dependent 
translation and protein secretion were observed for a subset of mRNAs with 
Mbnl-dependent localization. These findings hold several new implications for DM 
pathogenesis.
