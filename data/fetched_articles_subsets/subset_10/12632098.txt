Beta-catenin serves not only as a structural component of the 
E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion system, but also as a signaling molecule 
of the Wnt/wingless pathway. Mutations of beta-catenin and aberrant expression 
of its protein have been identified in a number of different types of human 
malignancies. To determine the role of beta-catenin in solid and cystic tumor 
(SCT) of the pancreas, a rare neoplasm usually observed in young females, we 
examined three primary tumors and one corresponding liver metastatic tumor 
presented in pediatric patients. Single strand conformation polymorphism and 
neucleotide sequencing analysis confirmed a TCT right curved arrow TTT somatic 
mutation at codon 37 changing serine to phenylalanine in one of the primary 
tumors and its corresponding metastatic tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis 
displayed abnormally strong nuclear and widespread cytoplasmic expression of 
beta-catenin in these tumors with the mutation. Our observations suggest that, 
in some SCTs of the pancreas presented in the pediatric age group, mutated 
beta-catenin has an important oncogenic effect.
