A 37-year-old male, splenectomized at the age of 1 year, was admitted to the 
ward with severe chest pain and signs of cardiogenic shock. Clinical 
investigations revealed the presence of both hemochromatosis and hereditary 
spherocytosis (HS). HLA typing showed A3,B7 and A24,B57 haplotypes and genetic 
analysis revealed homozygosity for the C282Y mutation. A family study was 
performed. The parents and four brothers were heterozygous for the C282Y 
mutation. Two of the brothers also presented high levels of iron stores and they 
had been splenectomized because of HS, while two other siblings had neither 
spherocytosis nor hemochromatosis. The mother had a mild anemia with dehydrated 
red blood cells (RBC), while the father appeared to have low-density, but normal 
RBC; none of them presented with spherocytosis. All siblings with spherocytosis 
and elevated iron stores showed a RBC density distribution similar to the 
mother. We present the first case with genetically proven hemochromatosis in 
combination with spherocytosis, focusing on the various possibilities of iron 
accumulation in individuals with spherocytosis and heterozygosity for the C282Y 
mutation.
