Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicle membranes involves the 
recruitment of clathrin and AP-2 adaptor complexes to the presynaptic plasma 
membrane. Phosphoinositides have been implicated in nucleating coat assembly by 
directly binding to several endocytotic proteins including AP-2 and AP180. Here, 
we show that the stimulatory effect of ATP and GTPgammaS on clathrin coat 
recruitment is mediated at least in part by increased levels of PIP2. We also 
provide evidence for a role of ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) via direct 
stimulation of a synaptically enriched phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase 
type Igamma (PIPKIgamma), in this effect. These data suggest a model according 
to which activation of PIPKIgamma by ARF6-GTP facilitates clathrin-coated pit 
assembly at the synapse.
