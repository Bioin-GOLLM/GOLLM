Scedosporium species are opportunistic fungi which preferentially affect 
patients with underlying conditions such as immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis 
(CF). While being the second most common molds capable to chronically colonize 
the CF lungs, the natural history of infection remains unclear. In filamentous 
fungi, a broad range of important secondary metabolites that are recognized as 
virulence factors are produced by multidomain non-ribosomal peptide synthetases 
(NRPSs). The aim of this study was to provide a global in silico analysis of 
NRPS-encoding genes based on the recently sequenced Scedosporium apiospermum 
genome. We uncovered a total of nine NRPS genes, of which six exhibited 
sufficient similarity scores with other fungal NRPSs to predict the class of the 
generated peptide: siderophores (n = 2), epidithiodioxopiperazines (n = 2), and 
cyclopeptides (n = 2). Phylogenetic trees based on the multiple alignments of 
adenylation (A) domain sequences corroborated these findings. Nevertheless, 
substrate prediction methods for NRPS A-domains tended to fail, thus questioning 
about the exact nature of the peptide produced. Further studies should be 
undertaken since NRPSs, which are not synthesized by human cells, could 
represent attractive therapeutic targets.
