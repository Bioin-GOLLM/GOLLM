OBJECTIVE: To report on two children manifesting multiple cafe-au-lait spots 
suspected as neurofibromatosis type 1, and perform NF1 gene mutation analysis.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from the 2 children, their unaffected 
parents and 100 normal controls. The entire coding region of the NF1 gene was 
amplified by PCR and subjected to direct sequencing.
RESULTS: In patient 1, a novel frameshift mutation c.1948delT (p.Leu650TyrfsX38) 
was identified in exon 12 of the NF1 gene. And in patient 2, a previously 
reported nonsense mutation c.541C>T (p.Gln181X) was revealed in exon 4b. The 
same mutations were not detected in their unaffected parents or 100 normal 
controls.
CONCLUSION: The two patients were diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 by 
molecular genetic testing. The pathogenic mutations were c.1948delT and 
c.541C>T, respectively.
