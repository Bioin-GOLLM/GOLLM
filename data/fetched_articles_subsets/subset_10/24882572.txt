Oxidative stress plays an important role on liver fibrosis progression in the 
course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme 
released by neutrophils and macrophages, responsible for generating hypochlorous 
acid and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may lead to liver injury in HCV 
infection. On the other hand, antioxidant enzymes such as manganese superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) controls ROS-mediated damage. The aim of the present study was 
to investigate the influence of MPO G-463A and SOD2 Ala16Val polymorphisms in 
the severity of liver fibrosis in individuals with chronic HCV infection. The 
present study included 270 patients with chronic HCV recruited from the 
Gastrohepatology Service of the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital/Liver Institute 
of Pernambuco (Recife, Northeastern Brazil). All patients underwent liver 
biopsy, which was classified according METAVIR score. The SNPs were determined 
by real-time PCR. After multivariate analysis adjustment, the GG genotype of MPO 
and the presence of metabolic syndrome were independently associated with 
fibrosis severity in women (P = 0.025 OR 2.25 CI 1.10-4.59 and P = 0.032 OR 2.32 
CI 1.07-5.01, respectively). The presence of the GG genotype seems to be a risk 
factor for fibrosis severity in women with HCV.
