Agrobacterium rhizogenes-transformed sugar beet hairy roots, expressing dsRNA 
from the Beet necrotic yellow vein virus replicase gene, were used as a novel 
approach to assess the efficacy of three intron-hairpin constructs at conferring 
resistance to rhizomania disease. Genetically engineered roots were similar in 
morphology to wild type roots but were characterized by a profound abundancy, 
rapid growth rate and, in some cases, plagiotropic development. Upon challenge 
inoculation, seedlings showed a considerable delay in symptom development 
compared to untransformed or vector-transformed seedlings, expressing dsRNA from 
an unrelated source. The transgenic root system of almost all seedlings 
contained no or very low virus titer while the non-transformed aerial parts of 
the same plants were found infected, leading to the conclusion that the hairy 
roots studied were effectively protected against the virus. This readily 
applicable novel method forms a plausible approach to preliminarily evaluate 
transgenic rhizomania resistance before proceeding in transformation and whole 
plant regeneration of sugar beet, a tedious and time consuming process for such 
a recalcitrant crop species.
