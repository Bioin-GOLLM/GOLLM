INTRODUCTION: Testing for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene 
mutations requires considerable multidisciplinary experience of clinicians (for 
appropriate patient selection), pathologists (for selection of appropriate 
cytological or histological material) and geneticists (for performing and 
reporting reliable molecular tests). We present our experience on the efficacy 
of routine EGFR testing in various types of tumor samples and the frequency of 
EGFR mutations in a large series of Polish non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients.
METHODS: Deletions in exon 19 and substitution L858R in exon 21 of EGFR gene 
were assessed using real-time PCR techniques in 1,138 small biopsies or 
cytological specimens and in 1,312 surgical samples.
RESULTS: Out of 2,450 diagnostic samples (containing >10% of tumor cells), the 
occurrence of EGFR gene mutations was 9%; more frequently in women (13.9%) and 
adenocarcinoma patients (10%), particularly with accompanying expression of TTF1 
(13.0%). The frequency of EGFR gene mutations was similar in cytological and 
histological specimens, and in primary and metastatic lesions, and did not 
depend on the percentage of tumor cells and quality of isolated DNA. Cytological 
or small biopsy, compared to surgical specimens showed lower percentage of tumor 
cells, with no impact on the quality of real-time PCR assay.
CONCLUSION: Cytological and small biopsy samples with low (10-20%) content of 
tumor cells and specimens from metastatic lesions are a sufficient source for 
EGFR mutation testing in NSCLC patients. The incidence of EGFR gene mutations in 
examined population was similar to those reported in other Caucasian 
populations.
