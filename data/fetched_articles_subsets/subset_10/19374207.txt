We report a case of 34 year old woman how has been hospitalized at the age of 6 
month with persistent vomitus. The vomitus was found to be caused by adrenal 
insufficiency with lack of all hormones of steroidobiosynthesis. The 
phenotypical femal child was diagnosed to have congenital lipoid adrenal 
hyperplasia with 46,XY DSD. 24 years later a homozygote mutation in the 
StAR-gene (L260P), which was first described in Switzerland, has been 
identified.
