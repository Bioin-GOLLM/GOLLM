The association between caprine PrP gene polymorphisms and its susceptibility to 
scrapie has been investigated in current years. As the ORF of the PrP gene is 
extremely erratic in different breeds of goats, we studied the PrP gene 
polymorphisms in 80 goats which belong to 11 Pakistani indigenous goat breeds 
from all provinces of Pakistan. A total of 6 distinct polymorphic sites (one 
novel) with amino acid substitutions were identified in the PrP gene which 
includes 126 (A -> G), 304 (G -> T), 379 (A -> G), 414 (C -> T), 428 (A -> G) 
and 718 (C -> T). The locus c.428 was found highly polymorphic in all breeds as 
compare to other loci. On the basis of these PrP variants NJ phylogenetic tree 
was constructed through MEGA6.1 which showed that all goat breeds along with 
domestic sheep and Mauflon sheep appeared as in one clade and sharing its most 
recent common ancestors (MRCA) with deer species while Protein analysis has 
shown that these polymorphisms can lead to varied primary, secondary and 
tertiary structure of protein. Based on these polymorphic variants, genetic 
distance, multidimensional scaling plot and principal component analyses 
revealed the clear picture regarding greater number of substitutions in cattle 
PrP regions as compared to the small ruminant species. In particular these 
findings may pinpoint the fundamental control over the scrapie in Capra hircus 
on genetic basis.
