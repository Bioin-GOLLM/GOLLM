Hfq is a bacterial protein that is involved in several aspects of nucleic acids 
metabolism. It has been described as one of the nucleoid associated proteins 
shaping the bacterial chromosome, although it is better known to influence 
translation and turnover of cellular RNAs. Here, we explore the role of 
Escherichia coli Hfq's C-terminal domain in the compaction of double stranded 
DNA. Various experimental methodologies, including fluorescence microscopy 
imaging of single DNA molecules confined inside nanofluidic channels, atomic 
force microscopy, isothermal titration microcalorimetry and electrophoretic 
mobility assays have been used to follow the assembly of the C-terminal and 
N-terminal regions of Hfq on DNA. Results highlight the role of Hfq's C-terminal 
arms in DNA binding, change in mechanical properties of the double helix and 
compaction of DNA into a condensed form. The propensity for bridging and 
compaction of DNA by the C-terminal domain might be related to aggregation of 
bound protein and may have implications for protein binding related gene 
regulation.
