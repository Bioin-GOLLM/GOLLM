We present a comprehensive survey of cytogenetic and genomic diversity of the 
GGAtAt genepool of wheat, thereby unlocking these plant genetic resources for 
wheat improvement. Wheat yields are stagnating around the world and new sources 
of genes for resistance or tolerances to abiotic traits are required. In this 
context, the tetraploid wheat wild relatives are among the key candidates for 
wheat improvement. Despite its potential huge value for wheat breeding, the 
tetraploid GGAtAt genepool is largely neglected. Understanding the population 
structure, native distribution range, intraspecific variation of the entire 
tetraploid GGAtAt genepool and its domestication history would further its use 
for wheat improvement. The paper provides the first comprehensive survey of 
genomic and cytogenetic diversity sampling the full breadth and depth of the 
tetraploid GGAtAt genepool. According to the results obtained, the extant GGAtAt 
genepool consists of three distinct lineages. We provide detailed insights into 
the cytogenetic composition of GGAtAt wheats, revealed group- and 
population-specific markers and show that chromosomal rearrangements play an 
important role in intraspecific diversity of T. araraticum. The origin and 
domestication history of the GGAtAt lineages is discussed in the context of 
state-of-the-art archaeobotanical finds. We shed new light on the complex 
evolutionary history of the GGAtAt wheat genepool and provide the basis for an 
increased use of the GGAtAt wheat genepool for wheat improvement. The findings 
have implications for our understanding of the origins of agriculture in 
southwest Asia.
