Despite comprehensive genomic analyses, no targeted therapies are approved for 
bladder cancer. Here, we investigate whether a single and combination therapy 
with targeted agents exert antitumor effects on bladder cancer cells through 
genomic alterations using a three-dimensional (3D) high-throughput screening 
(HTS) platform. Seven human bladder cancer cell lines were used to screen 24 
targeted agents. The effects of 24 targeted agents were dramatically different 
according to the genomic alterations of bladder cancer cells. BEZ235 (dual 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
inhibitor) showed antitumor effects against most cell lines, while AZD2014 (mTOR 
inhibitor) had an IC50 value lower than 2 Î¼M in 5637, J82, and RT4 cell lines. 
AZD5363 (protein kinase B (AKT) inhibitor) exerted antitumor effects on 5637, 
J82, and 253J-BV cells. J82 cells (PI3KCA and mTOR mutations) were sensitive to 
AZD5363, AZD2014, and BEZ235 alone or in AZD5363/AZD2014 and AZD5363/BEZ235 
combinations. Although all single drugs suppressed cell proliferation, the 
combination of drugs exhibited synergistic effects on cell viability and colony 
formation. The synergistic effects of the combination therapy on the 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, apoptosis, and EMT were evident in Western blotting. 
Thus, the 3D culture-based HTS platform could serve as a useful preclinical tool 
to evaluate various drug combinations.
