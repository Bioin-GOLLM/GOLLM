PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore associations between genetic polymorphisms 
and adverse effects due to preoperative chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, 
and fluorouracil (DCF) for esophageal cancer.
METHODS: Preoperative DCF (docetaxel, 70 mg/m2/day, day 1; cisplatin, 
70 mg/m2/day, day 1; fluorouracil, 750 mg/m2/day, days 1-5) was repeated every 
3 weeks for up to three cycles. Genotyping of nine candidate genetic 
polymorphisms was conducted using blood samples from the enrolled patients.
RESULTS: According to a multivariable analysis evaluating 50 patients, grade 3 
or worse neutropenia was more likely to occur in those with the ABCC2-24C/T or 
T/T genotype (rs717620) (OR, 5.30, P = 0.013). Additionally, patients with the 
TYMS 3'-UTR 0 bp/0 bp genotype (rs151264360) showed a trend toward grade 3 or 
worse hyponatremia (OR, 0.16, P = 0.005). Grade 2 or worse thrombocytopenia was 
more likely to occur in patients with the TNF-α-1031C/T or T/T genotype 
(rs1799964) (OR, 6.30, P = 0.016) and IL-6-634C/C genotype (rs1800796) (OR, 
0.18, P = 0.034), and grade 2 or worse anemia was more likely to occur in 
patients with the MCP-1-2518G/G genotype (rs1024611) (OR, 0.19, P = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: ABCC2-24C > T (rs717620), TYMS 3'-UTR 6-bp indel (rs151264360), 
TNF-α-1031T > C (rs1799964) as well as IL-6-634G > C (rs1800796), and 
MCP-1-2518A > G (rs1024611) polymorphisms might serve as independent and 
predictive biomarkers for neutropenia, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and 
anemia, respectively, during preoperative chemotherapy with docetaxel, 
cisplatin, and fluorouracil for patients with esophageal cancer.
