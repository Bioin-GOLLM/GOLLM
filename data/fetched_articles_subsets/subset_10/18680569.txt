BACKGROUND: Dab2, one of two mammalian orthologs of Drosophila Disabled, has 
been shown to be involved in cell positioning and formation of visceral endoderm 
during mouse embryogenesis, but its role in neuronal development is not yet 
fully understood. In this report, we have examined the localization of the Dab2 
protein in the mouse embryonic central nervous system (CNS) at different 
developmental stages.
RESULTS: Dab2 protein was transiently expressed in rhombomeres 5 and 6 of the 
developing hindbrain between E8.5 and E11.5, and in the floor plate of the 
neural tube from E9.5 to E12.5, following which it was no longer detectable 
within these regions. Dab2 protein was also identified within circumventricular 
organs including the choroid plexus, subcommissural organ and pineal gland 
during their early development. While Dab2 was still strongly expressed in the 
adult choroid plexus, immunoreactivity within the subcommissural organ and 
pineal gland was lost after birth. In addition, Dab2 was transiently expressed 
within a subpopulation of Iba1-positive mononuclear phagocytes (including 
presumed microglial progenitors) within the neural tube from E10.0 and was lost 
by E14.5. Dab2 was separately localized to Iba1 positive cells from E9.5 and 
subsequently to F4/80 positive cells (mature macrophage/myeloid-derived 
dendritic cells) positioned outside the neural tube from E12.5 onwards, 
implicating Dab2 expression in early cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. 
Dab2 did not co-localize with the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 at any 
developmental stage, suggesting that Dab2 positive cells in the developing CNS 
are unlikely to be differentiating neurons.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate the dynamic spatiotemporal 
expression of Dab2 protein within the CNS during development.
