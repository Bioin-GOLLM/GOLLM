Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined as a type of breast carcinoma 
that is negative for expression of oestrogene and progesterone hormone receptors 
(ER, PR) and HER2. This form of breast cancer is marked by its aggressiveness, 
low survival rate and lack of specific therapies. Recently, important molecular 
characteristics of TNBC have been highlighted and led to the identification of 
some biomarkers that could be used in diagnosis, as therapeutic targets or to 
assess the prognosis. In this review, we summarize recent progress in TNBC 
research focusing on the genetic and epigenetic alterations of TNBC and the 
potential use of these biomarkers in the targeted therapy for better management 
of TNBC.
