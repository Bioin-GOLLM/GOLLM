The expression of multiple receptors on intestinal epithelial cells enables an 
actively targeted carrier to significantly enhance the oral delivery of 
payloads. Conjugating the receptors' ligands on the surfaces of a 
particulate-delivery system allows site-specific targeting. Here, we used 
taurocholic acid (TCA) as a ligand for uptake of nanostructured lipid carriers 
(NLCs) mediated by a bile-acid transporter to improve oral bioavailability of 
curcumin (Cur). First, synthesis of TCA-polyethylene glycol 100-monostearate 
(S100-TCA) was carried out. Then, the physical and chemical properties of 
S100-TCA-modified Cur-loaded NLCs (Cur-TCA NLCs) with varying levels of S100-TCA 
modifications were investigated. Small particle size (<150 nm), high drug 
encapsulation (>90%), drug loading (about 3%), negative Î¶-potential (-7 to -3 
mV), and sustained release were obtained. In situ intestinal perfusion studies 
demonstrated improved absorption rate and permeability coefficient of Cur-TCA 
NLCs. Depending on the degree of modification, Cur-TCA NLCs displayed about a 
five- to 15-fold higher area under the curve in rats after oral administration 
than unmodified Cur NLCs, which established that the addition of S100-TCA to the 
NLCs boosted absorption of Cur. Further investigations of TCA NLCs might reveal 
a bright future for effective oral delivery of poorly bioavailable drugs.
