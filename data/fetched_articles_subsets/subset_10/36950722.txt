A new approach for the stabilization of the ferroelectric orthorhombic ZrO2 
films is demonstrated through nanosecond laser annealing (NLA) of as-deposited 
Si/SiOx /W(14 nm)/ZrO2 (8 nm)/W(22 nm), grown by ion beam sputtering at low 
temperatures. The NLA process optimization is guided by COMSOL multiphysics 
simulations. The films annealed under the optimized conditions reveal the 
presence of the orthorhombic phase, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction, electron 
backscatter diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Macroscopic 
polarization-electric field hysteresis loops show ferroelectric behavior, with 
saturation polarization of 12.8 µC cm-2 , remnant polarization of 12.7 µC cm-2 
and coercive field of 1.2 MV cm-1 . The films exhibit a wake-up effect that is 
attributed to the migration of point defects, such as oxygen vacancies, and/or a 
transition from nonferroelectric (monoclinic and tetragonal phase) to the 
ferroelectric orthorhombic phase. The capacitors demonstrate a stable 
polarization with an endurance of 6.0 × 105 cycles, demonstrating the potential 
of the NLA process for the fabrication of ferroelectric memory devices with high 
polarization, low coercive field, and high cycling stability.
