Loss-of-function mutations of EZH2, the enzymatic component of PRC2, have been 
associated with poor outcome and chemotherapy resistance in T-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Using isogenic T-ALL cells, with and without 
CRISPR/Cas9-induced EZH2-inactivating mutations, we performed a cell-based 
synthetic lethal drug screen. EZH2-deficient cells exhibited increased 
sensitivity to structurally diverse inhibitors of CHK1, an interaction that 
could be validated genetically. Furthermore, small-molecule inhibition of CHK1 
had efficacy in delaying tumor progression in isogenic EZH2-deficient, but not 
EZH2 wild-type, T-ALL cells in vivo, as well as in a primary cell model of 
PRC2-mutant ALL. Mechanistically, EZH2 deficiency resulted in a gene-expression 
signature of immature T-ALL cells, marked transcriptional upregulation of MYCN, 
increased replication stress, and enhanced dependency on CHK1 for cell survival. 
Finally, we demonstrate this phenotype is mediated through derepression of a 
distal PRC2-regulated MYCN enhancer. In conclusion, we highlight a novel and 
clinically exploitable pathway in high-risk EZH2-mutated T-ALL. SIGNIFICANCE: 
Loss-of-function mutations of PRC2 genes are associated with chemotherapy 
resistance in T-ALL, yet no specific therapy for this aggressive subtype is 
currently clinically available. Our work demonstrates that loss of EZH2 activity 
leads to MYCN-driven replication stress, resulting in increased sensitivity to 
CHK1 inhibition, a finding with immediate clinical relevance.This article is
