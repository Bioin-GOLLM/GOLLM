The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction is marked globally by elevated 
concentrations of iridium, emplaced by a hypervelocity impact event 66 million 
years ago. Here, we report new data from four independent laboratories that 
reveal a positive iridium anomaly within the peak-ring sequence of the Chicxulub 
impact structure, in drill core recovered by IODP-ICDP Expedition 364. The 
highest concentration of ultrafine meteoritic matter occurs in the post-impact 
sediments that cover the crater peak ring, just below the lowermost Danian 
pelagic limestone. Within years to decades after the impact event, this part of 
the Chicxulub impact basin returned to a relatively low-energy depositional 
environment, recording in unprecedented detail the recovery of life during the 
succeeding millennia. The iridium layer provides a key temporal horizon 
precisely linking Chicxulub to K-Pg boundary sections worldwide.
