Nitric oxide (NO) plays a central role in the physiololgy and pathology of 
diverse tissues. Different studies provide data suggesting that the endothelial 
cell nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) expression in peritumoral microvessels might 
be a prognostic indicator in breast cancer patients. However, the putative 
contribution of common NOS3 germline variants to breast cancer risk remained 
unknown. A recent work comprising 269 breast cancer patients and 244 controls 
suggested that NOS3 Glu298Asp polymorphism is associated to breast cancer risk 
(OR=1.9). We performed an independent analysis of these results in 440 unrelated 
patients and 321 controls from Spanish population. Although our study was 90% 
powered to detect ORs >/=1.55, did not find any significant difference in the 
Glu298Asp allele distribution between cases and controls (P > 0.42). These 
putative reasons for this result are discussed.
