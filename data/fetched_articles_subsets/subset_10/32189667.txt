Carbon monoxide (CO) has been the leading cause of poisoning mortality in many 
countries and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is a widely accepted treatment for CO 
poisoning. However, some patients with CO poisoning will still develop 
neurocognitive sequelae regardless of HBO therapy, which can persist since CO 
poisoning or be present days to weeks after a recovery from CO poisoning. HBO 
has been used in the prevention and treatment of neurocognitive sequelae after 
CO poisoning, and some mechanisms are also proposed for the potential 
neuroprotective effects of HBO on the neurocognitive impairment after CO 
poisoning, but there is still controversy on the effectiveness of HBO on 
neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning. In this paper, we briefly introduce 
the neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning, summarize the potential 
predictive factors of neurocognitive sequelae, and discuss the use of HBO in the 
treatment and prevention of neurocognitive sequelae after CO poisoning.
