Understanding the assembly mechanism and function of membrane proteins is a 
fundamental problem in biochemical research. Among the membrane proteins, G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largest class in the human body 
and have long been considered to function as monomers. Nowadays, the oligomeric 
assembly of GPCRs is widely accepted, although the functional importance and 
therapeutic intervention remain largely unexplored. This is partly due to 
difficulties in the heterologous production of membrane proteins. Cell-free 
protein synthesis (CFPS) with its endogenous endoplasmic reticulum-derived 
structures has proven as a technique to address this issue. In this study, we 
investigate for the first time the conceptual CFPS of a heteromeric GPCR, the 
γ-aminobutyric acid receptor type B (GABAB), from its protomers BR1 and BR2 
using a eukaryotic cell-free lysate. Using a fluorescence-based proximity 
ligation assay, we provide evidence for colocalization and thus suggesting 
heterodimerization. We prove the heterodimeric assembly by a bioluminescence 
resonance energy transfer saturation assay providing the manufacturability of a 
heterodimeric GPCR by CFPS. Additionally, we show the binding of a fluorescent 
orthosteric antagonist, demonstrating the feasibility of combining the CFPS of 
GPCRs with pharmacological applications. These results provide a simple and 
powerful experimental platform for the synthesis of heteromeric GPCRs and open 
new perspectives for the modelling of protein-protein interactions. Accordingly, 
the presented technology enables the targeting of protein assemblies as a new 
interface for pharmacological intervention in disease-relevant dimers.
