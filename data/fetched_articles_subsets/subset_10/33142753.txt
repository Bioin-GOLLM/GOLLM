Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) constitute a diverse group of bioactive molecules 
that provide multicellular organisms with protection against microorganisms, and 
microorganisms with weaponry for competition. Some AMPs can target cancer cells; 
thus, they are called anticancer peptides (ACPs). Due to their small size, 
positive charge, hydrophobicity and amphipathicity, AMPs and ACPs interact with 
negatively charged components of biological membranes. AMPs preferentially 
permeabilize microbial membranes, but ACPs additionally target mitochondrial and 
plasma membranes of cancer cells. The preference towards mitochondrial membranes 
is explained by their membrane potential, membrane composition resulting from 
α-proteobacterial origin and the fact that mitochondrial targeting signals could 
have evolved from AMPs. Taking into account the therapeutic potential of ACPs 
and millions of deaths due to cancer annually, it is of vital importance to find 
new cationic peptides that selectively destroy cancer cells. Therefore, to 
reduce the costs of experimental research, we have created a robust 
computational tool, CancerGram, that uses n-grams and random forests for 
predicting ACPs. Compared to other ACP classifiers, CancerGram is the first 
three-class model that effectively classifies peptides into: ACPs, AMPs and 
non-ACPs/non-AMPs, with AU1U amounting to 0.89 and a Kappa statistic of 0.65. 
CancerGram is available as a web server and R package on GitHub.
