Decades of evidence suggest that alterations in the adhesion properties of 
neoplastic cells endow them with an invasive and migratory phenotype. Tight 
junctions (TJs) are present in endothelial and epithelial cells. Tumors arise 
from such tissues, thus, the role of TJ proteins in the tumor microenvironment 
is highly relevant. In the TJ, junctional adhesion molecules (JAM) play a key 
role in assembly of the TJ and control of cell-cell adhesion. Reprogramming of 
immune cells using chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) to allow for target 
recognition and eradication of tumors is an FDA approved therapy. The 
best-studied CAR-T cells recognize CD19, a B-cell surface molecule. CD19 is not 
a unique marker for tumors, liquid or solid. To address this limitation, we 
developed a biologic containing three domains: (1) pH-low-insertion peptide 
(pHLIP), which recognizes the low pH of the cancer cells, leading to the 
insertion of the peptide into the plasma membrane. (2) An extracellular domain 
of JAM proteins that fosters cell-cell interactions. (3) CD19 to be targeted by 
CAR-T cells. Our modular design only targets cancer cells and when coupled with 
anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, it decreases proliferation and metastasis in at least two 
cancer cell lines.
