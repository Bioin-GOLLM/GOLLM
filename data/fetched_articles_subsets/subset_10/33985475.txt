BACKGROUND: Ectopia lentis is the common ocular manifestation of homocystinuria 
resulting from cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency which has a high 
risk of thromboembolic complications.
CASE PRESENTATION: The present study reports the case of a teenager with 
recurrent lens dislocation and glaucoma. He was diagnosed with CBS deficiency 
according to a high level of serum homocysteine and compound heterozygous 
mutations at two different positions on the CBS gene. Antiglaucoma eyedrops and 
a mydriatic successfully controlled the intraocular pressure, while oral 
pyridoxine and betaine uptake lowered the serum homocysteine level effectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with CBS deficiency may suffer from ectopia lentis, 
glaucoma and/or amblyopia. We firstly discovered a new mutation of CBS c. 
697 T > G which had not been reported before. The patient was pyridoxine 
responsive and well controlled by medicine.
