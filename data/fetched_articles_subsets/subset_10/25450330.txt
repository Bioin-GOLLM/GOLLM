In the 1920s Otto Warburg first described high glucose uptake, aerobic 
glycolysis, and high lactate production in tumors. Since then high glucose 
uptake has been utilized in the development of PET imaging for cancer. However, 
despite a deepened understanding of the molecular underpinnings of glucose 
metabolism in cancer, this fundamental difference between normal and malignant 
tissue has yet to be employed in targeted cancer therapy in the clinic. In this 
review, we highlight attempts in the recent literature to target cancer cell 
metabolism and elaborate on the challenges and controversies of these strategies 
in general and in the context of tumor cell heterogeneity in cancer.
