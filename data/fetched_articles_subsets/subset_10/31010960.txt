Insulin resistance (IR) is a harbinger of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and partly 
determined by genetic factors. However, genetically regulated mechanisms of IR 
remain poorly understood. Using gene expression, genotype, and insulin 
sensitivity data from the African American Genetics of Metabolism and Expression 
(AAGMEx) cohort, we performed transcript-wide correlation and expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses to identify IR-correlated cis-regulated 
transcripts (cis-eGenes) in adipose tissue. These IR-correlated cis-eGenes were 
tested in the European ancestry individuals in the Metabolic Syndrome in Men 
(METSIM) cohort for trans-ethnic replication. Comparison of Matsuda 
index-correlated transcripts in AAGMEx with the METSIM study identified 
significant correlation of 3,849 transcripts, with concordant direction of 
effect for 97.5% of the transcripts. cis-eQTL for 587 Matsuda index-correlated 
genes were identified in both cohorts. Enoyl-CoA hydratase domain-containing 3 
(ECHDC3) was the top-ranked Matsuda index-correlated cis-eGene. Expression 
levels of ECHDC3 were positively correlated with Matsuda index, and regulated by 
cis-eQTL, rs34844369 being the top cis-eSNP in AAGMEx. Silencing of ECHDC3 in 
adipocytes significantly reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and Akt 
Ser473 phosphorylation. RNA sequencing analysis identified 691 differentially 
expressed genes in ECHDC3-knockdown adipocytes, which were enriched in 
γ-linolenate biosynthesis, and known IR genes. Thus, our studies elucidated 
genetic regulatory mechanisms of IR and identified genes and pathways in adipose 
tissue that are mechanistically involved in IR.
