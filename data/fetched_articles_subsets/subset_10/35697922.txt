Racial disparity exists for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP), which 
leads to disparate morbidity and mortality worldwide. The enzyme heme 
oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is encoded by HMOX1, which has genetic polymorphisms in its 
regulatory region that impact its expression and activity and have been 
associated with various diseases. However, studies of these genetic variants in 
HDP have been limited. The objective of this study was to examine HMOX1 as a 
potential genetic contributor of ancestral disparity seen in HDP. First, the 
1000 Genomes Project (1 KG) phase 3 was utilized to compare the frequencies of 
alleles, genotypes, and estimated haplotypes of guanidine thymidine repeats 
(GTn; containing rs3074372) and A/T SNP (rs2071746) among females from five 
ancestral populations (Africa, the Americas, Europe, East Asia, and South Asia, 
N = 1271). Then, using genomic DNA from women with a history of HDP, we explored 
the possibility of HMOX1 variants predisposing women to HDP (N = 178) compared 
with an equivalent ancestral group from 1 KG (N = 263). Both HMOX1 variants were 
distributed differently across ancestries, with African women having a distinct 
distribution and an overall higher prevalence of the variants previously 
associated with lower HO-1 expression. The two HMOX1 variants display linkage 
disequilibrium in all but the African group, and within EUR cohort, LL and AA 
individuals have a higher prevalence in HDP. HMOX1 variants demonstrate 
ancestral differences that may contribute to racial disparity in HDP. 
Understanding maternal genetic contribution to HDP will help improve prediction 
and facilitate personalized approaches to care for HDP.
