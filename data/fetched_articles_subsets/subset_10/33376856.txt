G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play a pivotal role in regulating key 
physiological events in all animal species. Recent advances in collective 
analysis of genes and proteins revealed numerous potential neuropeptides and 
GPCRs from insect species, allowing for the characterization of peptide-receptor 
pairs. In this work, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based 
genetically encoded biosensors in intact mammalian cells to study the 
pharmacological features of the cognate GPCR of the type-C allatostatin (AST-C) 
peptide from the stick insect, Carausius morosus. Analysis of multiple 
downstream pathways revealed that AST-C can activate the human Gi2 protein, and 
not Gs or Gq, through AST-C receptor (AlstRC). Activated AlstRC recruits 
β-arrestin2 independent of the Gi protein but stimulates ERK phosphorylation in 
a Gi protein-dependent manner. Identification of Gαi-, arrestin-, and GRK-like 
transcripts from C. morosus revealed high evolutionary conservation at the G 
protein level, while β-arrestins and GRKs displayed less conservation. In 
conclusion, our study provides experimental and homology-based evidence on the 
functionality of vertebrate G proteins and downstream signaling biosensors to 
characterize early signaling steps of an insect GPCR. These results may serve as 
a scaffold for developing assays to characterize pharmacological and structural 
aspects of other insect GPCRs and can be used in deorphanization and pesticide 
studies.
