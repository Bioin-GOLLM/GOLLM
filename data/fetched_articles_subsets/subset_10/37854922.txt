Ameloblastoma (AM) is considered one of the most common lesions of odontogenic 
origin. Although it is always considered as benign neoplasm, ameloblastic 
carcinoma (AC) represents its malignant counterpart. It is characterized by the 
expansion of jaws, rapid growth, and a perforated cortex with well-defined 
unilocular/multilocular radiolucent lesions. To confirm the diagnosis of AM and 
AC is extremely crucial. Immunohistochemistry such as SOX2 and Ki67 plays a 
significant role in the confirmation of diagnosis. Management of these cases is 
from surgical excision with radical neck dissection. The prognosis is poor with 
only 5 years of survival. This review presents an interesting case of ex-AC, in 
which the patient was diagnosed at the same site with peripheral AM 1 year ago.
