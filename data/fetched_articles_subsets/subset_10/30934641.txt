One of the fundamental steps during development of the nervous system is the 
formation of proper connections between neurons and their target cells-a process 
called neural wiring, failure of which causes neurological disorders ranging 
from autism to Down's syndrome. Axons navigate through the complex environment 
of a developing embryo toward their targets, which can be far away from their 
cell bodies. Successful implementation of neuronal wiring, which is crucial for 
fulfillment of all behavioral functions, is achieved through an intimate 
interplay between axon guidance and neural activity. In this review, our focus 
will be on axon pathfinding and the implication of some of its downstream 
molecular components in neurological disorders. More precisely, we will talk 
about axon guidance and the molecules implicated in this process. After, we will 
briefly review the Rho family of small GTPases, their regulators, and their 
involvement in downstream signaling pathways of the axon guidance cues/receptor 
complexes. We will then proceed to the final and main part of this review, where 
we will thoroughly comment on the implication of the regulators for Rho 
GTPases-GEFs (Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors) and GAPs (GTPase-activating 
Proteins)-in neurological diseases and disorders.
