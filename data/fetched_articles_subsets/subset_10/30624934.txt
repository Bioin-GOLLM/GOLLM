To address drug resistance to HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NNRTIs), a series of novel diarylpyrimidine (DAPY) derivatives 
targeting "tolerant region I" and "tolerant region II" of the NNRTIs binding 
pocket (NNIBP) were designed utilizing a structure-guided scaffold-hopping 
strategy. The dihydrofuro[3,4- d]pyrimidine derivatives 13c2 and 13c4 proved to 
be exceptionally potent against a wide range of HIV-1 strains carrying single 
NNRTI-resistant mutations (EC50 = 0.9-8.4 nM), which were remarkably superior to 
that of etravirine (ETV). Meanwhile, both compounds exhibited comparable 
activities with ETV toward the virus with double mutations F227L+V106A and 
K103N+Y181C. Furthermore, the most active compound 13c2 showed favorable 
pharmacokinetic properties with an oral bioavailability of 30.96% and a 
half-life of 11.1 h, which suggested that 13c2 is worth further investigation as 
a novel NNRTI to circumvent drug resistance.
