The aim of the current experiment was to characterize and evaluate the effect of 
the dry-curing process on chemical composition, physicochemical properties, and 
sensory characteristics of the dry-cured Bísaro shoulders. For this purpose, 
thirty-eight raw forelegs were used, and no nitrites were added during the 
dry-curing process. This process increased protein, fat, ash content, and pH, 
with a decrease in moisture and water activity (p < 0.001). The dry-cured 
shoulders were darker (L*), less red (a*), and less yellow (b*) than the raw 
shoulders (p < 0.001), and this may be mainly due to the moisture reduction. The 
proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decreased during processing, 
whereas the saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) 
increased (p < 0.001), which could be related with the oxidative degradation. 
The sensory analysis showed that dry-cured Bísaro shoulders presented similar 
organoleptic characteristics to other dry-cured meat products. Also, the 
chemical composition and fatty acid profile of the dry-cured Bísaro shoulder 
showed results comparable to those of other cured products. This study revealed 
that it is possible to obtain safer and healthier dry-cured Bísaro shoulder 
products judging by these characteristics, since nitrites were not added in its 
preparation. These findings, along with the product’s high sensory attributes 
similar to more popular products such as ham, would give more advantage for its 
acceptability and market demand.
