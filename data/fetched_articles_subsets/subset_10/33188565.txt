The occurrence of endotracheal/endobronchial metastasis (EEM) after complete 
resection of a primary lung cancer is rare. Here, we report the case of an 
86-year-old woman in whom EEM occurred twice over a 20-year period following 
complete resection of a primary adenocarcinoma localized to the left main 
bronchus and trachea. The presence of EEM was confirmed by establishing 
immunohistochemical homology of the metastases with the primary tumor. To the 
best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of repetitive EEM of 
primary lung adenocarcinoma. Lymphatic invasion in the primary lesion suggested 
that a possible route for EEM was the peripheral lymphatic tract, explaining the 
slow recurrence rate. We conclude that observation of the trachea/bronchus over 
a long period post operation could be important in monitoring for EEM, 
particularly if lymphatic invasion is confirmed in the primary tumor.
