Unlipidated outer membrane protein 19 (U-Omp19) is a novel mucosal adjuvant in 
preclinical development to be used in vaccine formulations. U-Omp19 holds two 
main properties, it is capable of inhibiting gastrointestinal and lysosomal 
peptidases, increasing the amount of co-administered antigen that reaches the 
immune inductive sites and its half-life inside cells, and it is able to 
stimulate antigen presenting cells in vivo. These activities enable U-Omp19 to 
enhance the adaptive immune response to co-administrated antigens. To 
characterize the stability of U-Omp19 we have performed an extensive analysis of 
its physicochemical and biological properties in a 3-year long-term stability 
study, and under potentially damaging freeze-thawing and lyophilization stress 
processes. Results revealed that U-Omp19 retains its full protease inhibitor 
activity, its monomeric state and its secondary structure even when stored in 
solution for 36 months or after multiple freeze-thawing cycles. Non-enzymatic 
hydrolysis resulted the major degradation pathway for storage in solution at 
4 °C or room temperature which can be abrogated by lyophilization yet increasing 
protein tendency to form aggregates. This information will play a key role in 
the development of a stable formulation of U-Omp19, allowing an extended 
shelf-life during manufacturing, storage, and shipping of a future vaccine 
containing this pioneering adjuvant.
