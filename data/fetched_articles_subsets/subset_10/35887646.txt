BACKGROUND: Mutations in the Lamin A/C (LMNA) gene are responsible for about 6% 
of all familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) cases which tend to present at a 
young age and follow a fulminant course.
METHODS: We report a 47-year-old DCM patient with severely impaired left 
ventricular ejection fraction and NYHA functional class IV despite optimal heart 
failure treatment. Whole-exome sequencing revealed an LMNA E161K missense 
mutation as the pathogenetic cause for DCM in this patient. We generated a 
patient-specific LMNA-knock in (LMNA-KI) in vitro model using mES cells.
RESULTS: Beta adrenergic stimulation of cardiomyocytes derived from LMNA-KI mES 
cells resulted in augmented mTOR signaling and increased dysregulation of action 
potentials, which could be effectively prevented by the mTOR-inhibitor 
rapamycin. A cardiac biopsy confirmed strong activation of the mTOR-signaling 
pathway in the patient. An off-label treatment with oral rapamycin was initiated 
and resulted in an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (27.8% to 
44.5%), NT-BNP (8120 ng/L to 2210 ng/L) and NYHA functional class.
CONCLUSION: We have successfully generated the first in vitro model to 
recapitulate a patient-specific LMNA E161K mutation which leads to a severe form 
of DCM. The model may serve as a template for individualized and specific 
treatment of heart failure.
