AIMS: Interleukin-22 (IL-22) may be considered as an important cytokine in 
maintenance and progression of hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD). 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of treatment of 
hypertension and CAD on serum levels of IL-22 and the possible association of 
IL-22-rs1179251 gene polymorphism with hypertension and CAD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 286 subjects with suspected CAD were enrolled. 
Serum levels and gene polymorphism of IL-22 were investigated in hypertensive 
patients with no CAD (H-Tens), hypertensive patients with CAD (CAD + H-Tens); 
3), CAD patients with no hypertension (CAD); and non-hypertensive with no CAD 
subjects as a control group (Ctr). The patients received routine medications for 
hypertension and CAD. Serum IL-22 levels and IL-22-rs1179251 gene polymorphism 
were evaluated using ELISA and RFLP-/PCR techniques, respectively.
KEY FINDINGS: Findings demonstrated that there were significantly higher levels 
of IL-22 in case groups (H-Tens, CAD + H-Tens, and CAD) compared to the Ctr 
group (P = 0.001, P = 0.014, and P < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, 
atorvastatin, losartan and captopril were administered significantly more in 
patients compared to the Ctr group. The results indicated a decreased risk of 
CAD + H-Tens of rs1179251 dominant genetic model (OR = 0.324; 95% 
CI = 0.121-0.873; P = 0.026).
SIGNIFICANCE: Atorvastatin, losartan and captopril may be led to upregulation of 
IL-22 in CAD and hypertensive patients. Meanwhile, higher levels of circulating 
IL-22 could contribute to alleviating the hypertension and CAD conditions. The G 
allele of IL-22 rs1179251 may be a protective factor for concomitant 
hypertension and CAD.
