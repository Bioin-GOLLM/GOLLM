Front-line therapy for advanced and metastatic hormone receptor positive (HR+), 
HER2 negative (HER-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is endocrine 
therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i). The introduction of CDK4/6i has 
dramatically improved progression-free survival and, in some cases, overall 
survival. The optimal sequencing of post-front-line therapy must be personalized 
to patients' overall health and tumor biology. This paper reviews approved next 
lines of therapy for mBC and available data on efficacy post-progression on 
CDK4/6i. Given the success of endocrine front-line therapy, there has been an 
expansion in therapies under clinical investigation targeting the estrogen 
receptor in novel ways. There are also clinical trials ongoing attempting to 
overcome CDK4/6i resistance. This paper will review these drugs under 
investigation, review efficacy data when possible, and provide descriptions of 
the adverse events reported.
