The D-A-CH reference value (D-A-CH arises from the initial letters of the common 
country identification for the countries Germany (D), Austria (A) and 
Switzerland (CH)) for folate equivalents had been set at 400 μg/d for adults in 
the year 2000. By that time, the prevention of cardiovascular diseases through 
reduction of homocysteine was considered an important target of the reference 
value. Since that time a number of research papers revealed that in spite of an 
inverse association between folate-rich diet and chronic diseases, a preventive 
effect of folic acid intake on cardiovascular events was not supported by 
randomized controlled trials, and the reduction of plasma homocysteine levels to 
around 10-12 μmol/l did not reduce the risk for thromboembolic and 
cardiovascular diseases in persons already affected by these diseases. These 
results together with the observation that folate intakes below 400 μg/d result 
in a sufficient folate status justified a review of the current literature 
and-consequently-a reduction of the reference value to 300 μg/d for adults. This 
reference value is expressed as dietary folate equivalents that take into 
account the difference in bioavailability between folic acid and all types of 
folates in food. The recommendation to take a daily supplement of 400 μg of 
synthetic folic acid for women who intend to get pregnant and until the end of 
the first trimester of pregnancy is maintained.
