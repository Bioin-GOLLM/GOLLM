DiGeorge syndrome, or velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS/VCFS), is a rare and 
usually sporadic congenital genetic disorder resulting from a constitutional 
microdeletion at chromosome 22q11.2. While rare cases of malignancy have been 
described, likely due to underlying immunodeficiency, central nervous system 
tumors have not yet been reported. We describe an adolescent boy with DGS/VCFS 
who developed a temporal lobe pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. High-resolution 
single nucleotide polymorphism array studies of the tumor confirmed a 
constitutional 22q11.21 deletion, and revealed acquired gains, losses and copy 
number neutral loss of heterozygosity of several chromosomal regions, including 
a homozygous deletion of the CDKN2A/B locus. The tumor also demonstrated a 
common V600E mutation in the BRAF oncogene. This is the first reported case of a 
patient with DiGeorge syndrome developing a CNS tumor of any histology and 
expands our knowledge about low-grade CNS tumor molecular genetics.
