BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common chronic disease with several 
complications. Given that, studies on the association of plant-based diet 
indices (PDIs) with risk of MetS among adults with obesity, are limited, we 
aimed to examine the association between PDIs (including overall PDI, healthy 
PDI (hPDI), unhealthy PDI (uPDI)) and MetS in Iranian adults with obesity.
METHODS: In Tabriz, Iran, a total of 347 adults between the ages of 20 and 50 
participated in this cross-sectional research study. We created an overall PDI, 
hPDI, and uPDI from validated semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire 
(FFQ) data. To investigate the association between hPDI, overall PDI, uPDI, and 
MetS and its components, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The average age was 40.78 ± 9.23 years, and the average body mass index 
was 32.62 ± 4.80 kg/m2. There was no significant association between overall PDI 
(OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.54-1.47), hPDI (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.48-1.40), and uPDI (OR: 
0.83; 95% CI: 0.87-2.46) with MetS, even after adjustment for confounders. 
Moreover, our findings showed that participants with the highest adherence to 
uPDI had a higher chance of hyperglycemia (OR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.13-5.52). Also, 
this association was significant in the first (OR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.04-6.04) and 
second (OR: 2.58; 95% CI: 1.05-6.33) models, after controlling for covariates. 
However, in both adjusted and crude models, we did not find a significant 
association between hPDI and PDI scores and MetS components such as high 
triglyceride, high waist circumference, low High-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, raised blood pressure, and hyperglycemia. Moreover, those in the 
top tertile of uPDI had higher fasting blood sugar and insulin levels when 
compared with those in the first tertile, and subjects in the last tertile of 
hPDI compared with participants in the first tertile had lower weight, 
waist-to-hip ratio, and fat-free mass.
CONCLUSION: We found a direct significant association between uPDI and odds of 
hyperglycemia in the whole population of study. Future large-scale, prospective 
studies on PDIs and the MetS are necessary to confirm these findings.
