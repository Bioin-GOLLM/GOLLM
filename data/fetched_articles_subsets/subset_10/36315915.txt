PURPOSE: APOBEC mutagenesis underlies somatic evolution and accounts for tumor 
heterogeneity in several cancers, including breast cancer (BC). In this study, 
we evaluated the characteristics of a real-world cohort for time-to-treatment 
discontinuation (TTD) and overall survival on CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) plus 
endocrine therapy (ET) and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
METHODS: Comprehensive genomic profiling results from 29,833 BC samples were 
analyzed for tumor mutational burden and APOBEC signatures. For clinical 
outcomes, a deidentified nationwide (United States-based) BC Clinico-Genomic 
Database (CGDB) was evaluated with log-rank and Cox models. Patients with 
hormone receptor-positive (HR+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2-negative (HER2-) BC who received first-line ET and CDK4/6i were included. 
Eligible patients from Mayo Clinic and Duke University were HR+ HER2- BC with 
sequencing data between September 2013 and July 2020.
RESULTS: Of 29,833 samples sequenced, 7.9% were APOBEC+ with a high rate in 
invasive lobular carcinoma (16.7%) and in metastatic tumors (9.7%) relative to 
locally biopsied BC (4.3%; P < .001). In CGDB, 857 patients with HR+ HER2- BC 
received ET plus CDK4/6i in the first line. APOBEC+ patients had significantly 
shorter TTD on ET plus CDK4/6i than APOBEC- patients, 7.8 (95% CI, 4.3 to 14.6) 
versus 12.4 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 14.1; hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.03 to 
2.39; P = .0036). Clinical benefit to immune checkpoint inhibitors was observed 
in HR+ HER2-, APOBEC+, tumor mutational burden-high patients, with four of nine 
CGDB patients (TTD 0.3-11.3 months) and four of six patients in Duke/Mayo 
cohorts (TTD 0.9-40.5 months) with a TTD of â‰¥ 3 months.
CONCLUSION: APOBEC+ HR+ HER2- patients had shorter TTD on first-line ET plus 
CDK4/6i relative to APOBEC- patients. Further research is needed to optimize the 
treatment of APOBEC+ HR+ HER2- BC and to investigate the efficacy of 
immunotherapeutic strategies in this population.
