Background Mechanisms mediating hypertensive effects of overweight and obesity 
have not been fully elucidated. We showed previously that activation of pregnane 
X receptor (PXR) by rifampicin elevates 24-hour blood pressure (BP) and plasma 
4β-hydroxycholesterol (4βHC), agonist for liver X receptor (LXR). Methods and 
Results In combined "PXR activation data set" (n=62) of 4 clinical trials, 1 
week rifampicin dosing increased office systolic BP (SBP) by 3.1 mm Hg, DBP 
1.8 mm Hg, and mean arterial pressure 2.2 mm Hg in comparison with placebo 
(P<0.01). Plasma 4βHC had negative correlation with SBP both in rifampicin 
(r=-0.46, P=0.0002) and placebo (r=-0.45, P=0.0003) arms, although 4βHC was 
elevated >3-fold by rifampicin. In "non-intervention data set" (n=102) of 
patients with obesity and healthy volunteers (body mass index, 19.2-55.2 kg/m2), 
4βHC had negative correlations (P<0.00001) with office SBP (r=-0.51), diastolic 
BP (r=-0.50), and mean arterial pressure (r=-0.54). Lean women had higher 4βHC 
than men, with increasing weight repressing 4βHC (r=-0.62, P<0.00001) in both 
sexes. In multiple linear regression analysis, the only statistically 
significant predictor for SBP was 4βHC. Six-day PXR agonist dosing elevated SBP 
in rats (n=7-8/group). PXR activation elevated 4βHC and after PXR agonist was 
withdrawn and elevated 4βHC was left to act alone, SBP was reduced on days 7 to 
14 in comparison with control rats. Conclusions PXR activation elevates SBP. 
Elevated circulating 4βHC lowers SBP in rats, and higher 4βHC is an independent 
predictor of lower SBP in humans. PXR-4βHC-LXR is novel BP-regulating pathway 
deregulated in overweight and obesity by repressed 4βHC, with implications for 
sex-specific BP regulation. Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov;
