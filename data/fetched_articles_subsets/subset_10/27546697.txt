Association of two selected polymorphisms with developed endometriosis in women 
from Slovakia.

OBJECTIVES: To clarify the connection between two selected mononucleotide 
polymorphisms (rs4957014 and rs3756712) in programmed cell death gene 6 (PDCD6) 
and endometriosis development risk in patients belonging to the majority 
population of Slovakia.
METHODS: From all women involved in the research a buccal DNA sample was taken. 
A genetic analysis of selected polymorphisms was implemented using Real-time PCR 
method. Variance in allelic and genotype frequencies was statistically evaluated 
between the controlgroup and the group of patients.
RESULTS: The analysed group consisted of 52 women suffering from endometriosis 
and the control group of 63 women. Variant G allele frequency in the group of 
patients in case of polymorphism rs3756712 had a value of 0.42 and in the 
control group 0.29; that represents its statistically and significantly higher 
occurrence in the group of patients suffering from endometriosis (p = 0.029 and 
OR = 1.833). Presence of G allele is related to almost 1.9 times higher risk of 
endometriosis development.
CONCLUSION: Achieved results show that polymorphism rs3756712 is significantly 
associated with the risk of endometriosis development in Slovak women. 
Polymorphism rs4957014 did not show any connection with development of 
endometriosis (Tab. 5, Ref. 10).
