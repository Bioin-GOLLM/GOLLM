Multicellular spheroids are useful models for drug testing or studying tumor 
biology, but their production requires specialized approaches. Here, we present 
a protocol to produce viable spheroids by slow rotation around a horizontal axis 
using standard culture tubes. We describe steps for both seed and starter 
culture, and maintenance and expansion of spheroids. We detail assessment of 
spheroid size, count, viability, and immunohistochemistry. This protocol reduces 
gravitational forces that lead to cell clumping and is amenable to 
high-throughput use.
