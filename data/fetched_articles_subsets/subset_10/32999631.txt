BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence implicates circular RNAs (circRNAs) in various 
biological processes during cancer progression. Gastric cancer is a main cause 
of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Herein, we aimed at investigating whether 
circ_002117 mediates gastric cancer progression through endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) stress.
METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis detected differentially expressed circRNAs and 
their target miRNA candidates, and RT-qPCR was performed to detect expression of 
circ_002117, microRNA (miRNA)-370 and HERPUD1 in gastric cancer tissues and 
cells. Gastric cancer cells were transfected with plasmids and their 
proliferative ability and apoptosis were detected with gain- and 
loss-of-function assay. The ER of treated cells was observed under a 
transmission electron microscope. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RIP 
were performed to detect the interaction between HEPRUD1, miR-370 and 
circ_002117-treated cells were injected into mice to establish xenograft tumor 
model.
RESULTS: Circ_002117 and HEPRUD1 were poorly expressed whereas miR-370 was 
highly expressed in clinical cancer tissues and cells. Circ_002117 was indicated 
to target and suppress miR-370 expression, while HERPUD1 was directly targeted 
by miR-370. Circ_002117 overexpression or miR-370 deficiency promoted ER 
stress-induced apoptosis and decreased proliferation of gastric cancer cells, 
which was reversed by silencing of HEPRUD1. Circ_002117 overexpression or 
miR-370 depletion significantly suppressed gastric cancer tumorigenesis in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken altogether, circ_002117 facilitated ER stress-induced 
apoptosis in gastric cancer by upregulating HERPUD1 through miR-370 inhibition.
