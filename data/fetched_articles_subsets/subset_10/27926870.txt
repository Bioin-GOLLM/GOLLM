Cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, begins with the formation of a 
cleavage furrow. How the mitotic spindle specifies the furrow at the equator in 
animal cells remains unknown. Current models propose that the concentration of 
the RhoGEF ECT2 at the spindle midzone and the equatorial plasma membrane 
directs furrow formation. Using chemical genetic and optogenetic tools, we 
demonstrate that the association of ECT2 with the plasma membrane during 
anaphase is required and sufficient for cytokinesis. Local membrane targeting of 
ECT2 leads to unilateral furrowing, highlighting the importance of local ECT2 
activity. ECT2 mutations that prevent centralspindlin binding compromise 
concentration of ECT2 at the midzone and equatorial membrane but sustain 
cytokinesis. While the association of ECT2 with the plasma membrane is essential 
for cytokinesis, our data suggest that ECT2 recruitment to the spindle midzone 
is insufficient to account for equatorial furrowing and may act redundantly with 
yet-uncharacterized signals.
