To evaluate the associations between four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
in CYP4A11 and CYP4F2 and ischemic stroke (IS), and between these variants and 
atherothrombotic events after stroke. IS patients (n=396) and controls (n=378) 
were genotyped for two CYP4A11 SNPs (rs2269231 and rs9333025) and two CYP4F2 
SNPs (rs2108622 and rs3093135). Patients were followed up for 12 months after 
the stroke for the atherothrombotic events. The frequency of the rs9333025 GG 
genotype was significantly higher in IS patients than in controls. Logistic 
regression analysis showed that the presence of rs9333025 GG in patients was 
associated with significantly higher risk of IS. Cox regression analysis 
revealed that the rs9333025 GG genotype was an independent risk factor for 
atherothrombotic events after stroke. The rs9333025 GG genotype increases 
patients' susceptibility to IS and is associated with high frequencies of 
atherothrombotic events in stroke patients.
