PPAR antagonists are ligands that bind their receptor with high affinity without 
transactivation activity. Recently, they have been demonstrated to maintain 
insulin-sensitizing and antidiabetic properties, and they serve as an 
alternative treatment for metabolic diseases. In this work, an affinity-based 
bioassay was found to be effective for selecting PPAR ligands from the dried 
extract of an African plant (Diospyros bipindensis). Among the ligands, we 
identified betulinic acid (BA), a compound already known for its 
anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour and antidiabetic properties, as a PPARγ and PPARα 
antagonist. Cell differentiation assays showed that BA inhibits adipogenesis and 
promotes osteogenesis; either down-regulates or does not affect the expression 
of a series of adipogenic markers; and up-regulates the expression of osteogenic 
markers. Moreover, BA increases basal glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The 
crystal structure of the complex of BA with PPARγ sheds light, at the molecular 
level, on the mechanism by which BA antagonizes PPARγ, and indicates a unique 
binding mode of this antagonist type. The results of this study show that the 
natural compound BA could be an interesting and safe candidate for the treatment 
of type 2 diabetes and bone diseases.
