Transcription of the Escherichia coli biotin (bio) operon is regulated by BirA, 
a protein that is not only the repressor that regulates bio operon expression by 
DNA binding but also the enzyme that covalently attaches biotin to its cognate 
acceptor proteins. Binding of BirA to the bio operator requires dimerization of 
the protein that is triggered by BirA-catalyzed synthesis of biotinoyl-adenylate 
(bio-AMP), the obligatory intermediate of the attachment reaction. The current 
model postulates that the unmodified acceptor protein binds the monomeric 
BirA:bio-AMP complex and thereby blocks assembly (dimerization) of the form of 
BirA that binds DNA. We report that expression of fusion proteins that carry 
synthetic biotin-accepting peptide sequences was as effective as the natural 
acceptor protein in derepression of bio operon transcription. These peptide 
sequences have sequences that are remarkably dissimilar to that of the natural 
acceptor protein, and our data thus argue that the regulatory switch does not 
require the extensive protein-protein interactions postulated in the current 
model.
