BACKGROUND: N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) RNA modification is known as a common 
epigenetic regulation form in eukaryotic cells. Emerging studies show that m6 A 
in noncoding RNAs makes a difference, and the aberrant expression of m6 
A-associated enzymes may cause diseases. The demethylase alkB homologue 5 
(ALKBH5) plays diverse roles in different cancers, but its role during gastric 
cancer (GC) progression is not well known.
METHODS: The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, 
immunohistochemistry staining and western blotting assays were used to detect 
ALKBH5 expression in GC tissues and human GC cell lines. The function assays in 
vitro and xenograft mouse model in vivo were used to investigate the effects of 
ALKBH5 during GC progression. RNA sequencing, MeRIP sequencing, RNA stability 
and luciferase reporter assays were performed to explore the potential molecular 
mechanisms involved in the function of ALKBH5. RNA binding protein 
immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq), RIP and RNA pull-down assays were 
performed to examine the influence of LINC00659 on the ALKBH5-JAK1 interaction.
RESULTS: ALKBH5 was highly expressed in GC samples and associated with 
aggressive clinical features and poor prognosis. ALKBH5 promoted the abilities 
of GC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. The m6 A 
modification on JAK1 mRNA was removed by ALKBH5, which resulted in the 
upregulated expression of JAK1. LINC00659 facilitated ALKBH5 binding to and 
upregulated JAK1 mRNA depending on an m6 A-YTHDF2 manner. Silencing of ALKBH5 or 
LINC00659 disrupted GC tumourigenesis via the JAK1 axis. JAK1 upregulation 
activated the JAK1/STAT3 pathway in GC.
CONCLUSION: ALKBH5 promoted GC development via upregulated JAK1 mRNA expression 
mediated by LINC00659 in an m6 A-YTHDF2-dependent manner, and targeting ALKBH5 
may be a promising therapeutic method for GC patients.
