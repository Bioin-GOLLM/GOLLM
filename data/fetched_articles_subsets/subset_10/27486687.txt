FBXW7 is a ubiquitin ligase that mediates ubiquitylation of oncoproteins, such 
as c-Myc, cyclin E, Notch and c-Jun. FBXW7 is a known tumor-suppressor gene, and 
mutations in FBXW7 have been reported in various human malignancies. In this 
study, we examined the sequences of the FBXW7 and p53 genes in 57 ovarian cancer 
clinical samples. Interestingly, we found no FBXW7 mutations associated with 
amino acid changes. We also investigated FBXW7 expression levels in 126 
epithelial ovarian tumors. FBXW7 expression was negatively correlated with the 
malignant potential of ovarian tumors. That is to say, FBXW7 expression levels 
in ovarian cancer samples were significantly lower than those in borderline and 
benign tumors (P < 0.01). FBXW7 expression levels in serous carcinoma samples 
were the lowest among four major histological subtypes. In addition, p53-mutated 
ovarian cancer samples showed significantly lower levels of FBXW7 expression 
compared with p53 wild-type cancer samples (P < 0.001). DNA methylation arrays 
and bisulfite PCR sequencing experiments revealed that 5'-upstream regions of 
FBXW7 gene in p53-mutated samples were significantly higher methylated compared 
with those in p53 wild-type samples (P < 0.01). This data indicates that p53 
mutations might suppress FBXW7 expression through DNA hypermethylation of FBXW7 
5'-upstream regions. Thus, FBXW7 expression was downregulated in ovarian 
cancers, and was associated with p53 mutations and the DNA methylation status of 
the 5'-upstream regions of FBXW7.
