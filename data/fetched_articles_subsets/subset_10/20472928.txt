OBJECTIVE: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a complex polygenic disease in which 
more than 1 genetic locus is likely to contribute to disease susceptibility and 
clinical expression. BANK, an adaptor molecule, has been suggested to 
participate in the B cell antigen receptors-mediated calcium homeostasis. We 
assessed for the first time the implication of BANK1 functional variants in 
susceptibility to GCA.
METHODS: Two hundred twenty-two patients with biopsy-proven GCA and 534 matched 
controls were assessed. DNA from patients and controls was obtained from 
peripheral blood. Samples were genotyped for 3 putative functional BANK1 gene 
polymorphisms (rs17266594 T/C, rs10516487 G/A, rs3733197 G/A) using a TaqMan 
allele discrimination assay.
RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in genotype distribution 
between patients with biopsy-proven GCA and controls for these 3 gene 
polymorphisms. A trend for a decreased risk of having GCA was observed in 
individuals carrying the BANK1 rs3733197 GG genotype (patients with GCA 43.9% 
compared to 51.6% in controls; p = 0.06, OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53-1.02). The 
frequency of BANK1 rs3733197 allele G was marginally decreased in patients with 
biopsy-proven GCA compared to controls (p = 0.09, OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64-1.04). 
Haplotype analysis of 3-single-nucleotide polymorphisms found no statistically 
significant differences between patients with GCA and controls. No significant 
differences for the BANK1 gene polymorphisms were found when patients were 
stratified according to specific clinical features of the disease.
CONCLUSION: Our results do not support a major implication of the BANK1 locus in 
susceptibility to GCA.
