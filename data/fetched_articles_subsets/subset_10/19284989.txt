Currently there is pressing need to develop novel therapeutic agents for the 
treatment of infections by the human respiratory pathogens Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The neuraminidases of these pathogens 
are important for host colonization in animal models of infection and are 
attractive targets for drug discovery. To aid in the development of inhibitors 
against these neuraminidases, we have determined the crystal structures of the 
P. aeruginosa enzyme NanPs and S. pneumoniae enzyme NanA at 1.6 and 1.7A 
resolution, respectively. In situ proteolysis with trypsin was essential for the 
crystallization of our recombinant NanA. The active site regions of the two 
enzymes are strikingly different. NanA contains a deep pocket that is similar to 
that in canonical neuraminidases, while the NanPs active site is much more open. 
The comparative studies suggest that NanPs may not be a classical neuraminidase, 
and may have distinct natural substrates and physiological functions. This work 
represents an important step in the development of drugs to prevent respiratory 
tract colonization by these two pathogens.
