A rapid, facile and selective detection of anti-H5 subtype avian influenza virus 
(AIV) antibody in serum by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) was 
achieved. A fragment of recombinant H5 subtype AIV hemagglutinin was produced 
and labeled with fluorescein to use it as a labeled antigen in FPIA. This 
labeled antigen was mixed with anti-AIV sera (H1-H16 subtypes) and FP of the 
mixture was measured using a portable FP analyzer on a microdevice. It was found 
that FP increased in proportion to the concentration of anti-H5 AIV antibody 
(serum) and was significantly higher than FP obtained with the other sera. The 
selective detection of anti-H5 subtype AIV antibody was confirmed. The required 
volume of original sample was 2 μL and analysis time was within 20 min. This 
detection system realizes an efficient on-site diagnosis and surveillance of 
AIV.
