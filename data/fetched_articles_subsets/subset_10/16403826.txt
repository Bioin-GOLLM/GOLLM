OBJECTIVE: To prospectively monitor inflammatory activity over a prolonged 
period in a cohort of Turkish patients with FMF, their healthy relatives and 
healthy controls and to relate this to their MEFV genotypes.
METHODS: 43 patients with FMF and 75 of their asymptomatic relatives underwent 
fortnightly assessments and venesection for measurement of CRP and SAA over 5 
months. 50 unrelated healthy population matched controls were also studied. MEFV 
genotyping was performed on all participants and comparisons were made between 
the different groups.
RESULTS: Paired MEFV mutations were detected in 84% of FMF patients and single 
mutations in 12%. Substantial acute phase reactivity was seen among the patients 
with FMF during attacks (median SAA 693 mg/l, CRP 115 mg/l). Between attacks 
there was also some inflammatory activity (median SAA 6 mg/l, CRP 4 mg/l). Among 
healthy controls 16% were heterozygotes for MEFV mutations and 4% had two 
mutations. As expected there was a substantial carrier rate among healthy 
relatives with mutations detected in almost 92%. Asymptomatic MEFV heterozygotes 
had elevated acute phase proteins compared to wild type subjects.
CONCLUSION: Substantial sub-clinical inflammation occurs widely and over 
prolonged periods in patients with FMF, indicating that the relatively 
infrequent clinically overt attacks represent the 'tip of the iceberg' in this 
disorder. Both basal and peak acute phase protein concentrations were greater in 
MEFV heterozygotes than in wild-type controls, regardless of mutation 
demonstrating a 'pro-inflammatory' phenotype among FMF carriers. Upregulation of 
the acute phase response among carriers of FMF may augment their innate host 
response and contribute to better resistance to infection.
