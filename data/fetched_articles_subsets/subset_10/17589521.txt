Functional deficiency of the FEN1 gene has been suggested to cause genomic 
instability and cancer predisposition. We have identified a group of FEN1 
mutations in human cancer specimens. Most of these mutations abrogated two of 
three nuclease activities of flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1). To demonstrate the 
etiological significance of these somatic mutations, we inbred a mouse line 
harboring the E160D mutation representing mutations identified in human cancers. 
Selective elimination of nuclease activities led to frequent spontaneous 
mutations and accumulation of incompletely digested DNA fragments in apoptotic 
cells. The mutant mice were predisposed to autoimmunity, chronic inflammation 
and cancers. The mutator phenotype results in the initiation of cancer, whereas 
chronic inflammation promotes the cancer progression. The current work 
exemplifies the approach of studying the mechanisms of individual polymorphisms 
and somatic mutations in cancer development, and may serve as a reference in 
developing new therapeutic regimens through the suppression of inflammatory 
responses.
