The type II restriction endonucleases are indispensible tools for molecular 
biology. Although enzymes recognizing nearly 300 unique sequences are known, the 
ability to engineer enzymes to recognize any sequence of choice would be 
valuable. However, previous attempts to engineer new recognition specificity 
have met limited success. Here we report the rational engineering of multiple 
new type II specificities. We recently identified a family of MmeI-like type II 
endonucleases that have highly similar protein sequences but different 
recognition specificity. We identified the amino-acid positions within these 
enzymes that determine position specific DNA base recognition at three positions 
within their recognition sequences through correlations between their aligned 
amino-acid residues and aligned recognition sequences. We then altered the amino 
acids at the identified positions to those correlated with recognition of a 
desired new base to create enzymes that recognize and cut at predictable new DNA 
sequences. The enzymes so altered have similar levels of endonuclease activity 
compared to the wild-type enzymes. Using simple and predictable mutagenesis in 
this family it is now possible to create hundreds of unique new type II 
restriction endonuclease specificities. The findings suggest a simple mechanism 
for the evolution of new DNA specificity in Nature.
