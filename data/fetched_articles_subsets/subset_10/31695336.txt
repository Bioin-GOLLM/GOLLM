PURPOSE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a relatively common, devastating traumatic 
condition resulting in permanent disability. In this study, the use of exosomes 
derived from bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs-Exo) as a cell-free therapy for 
the treatment of SCI in rats was investigated to gain insights into their 
mechanisms of action.
METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into three groups, Sham (treated with PBS), 
SCI (SCI injury + PBS) and SCI + Exo (SCI injury + BMSCs-Exo). Changes in the 
complement system between the three groups were assessed with the use of 
proteomics. The proteomic data were verified using reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, the distributions 
of BMSCs-Exo in rats with SCI were detected by immunofluorescence. Moreover, 
SCI-activated NF-κB levels were determined using Western blot.
RESULTS: SCI insult increased complement levels, including C4, C5, C6, C4 
binding protein alpha and complement factor H. In contrast, the SCI + BMSCs-Exo 
group exhibited attenuated SCI-induced complement levels. Immunofluorescence 
assay results revealed that BMSCs-Exo mainly accumulated at the spinal cord 
injury site and were bound to microglia cells. Western blot analysis of tissue 
lysates showed that BMSCs-Exo treatment also inhibited SCI-activated nuclear 
factor kappa-B (NF-κB).
CONCLUSION: BMSCs-Exo play a protective role in spinal cord injury by inhibiting 
complement mRNA synthesis and release and by inhibiting SCI-activated NF-κB by 
binding to microglia.
