The mol-ecular conformation of the title compound, C17H14ClN3O4, is stabilized 
by an intra-molecular C-H⋯O contact, forming an S(6) ring motif. In the crystal, 
the mol-ecules are connected by N-H⋯O hydrogen-bond pairs along the b-axis 
direction as dimers with R 2 2(8) and R 2 2(14) ring motifs and as ribbons 
formed by inter-molecular C-H⋯N hydrogen bonds. There are weak van der Waals 
inter-actions between the ribbons. The most important contributions to the 
surface contacts are from H⋯H (34.9%), O⋯H/H⋯O (19.2%), C⋯H/H⋯C (11.9%), 
Cl⋯H/H⋯Cl (10.7%) and N⋯H/H⋯N (10.4%) inter-actions, as concluded from a 
Hirshfeld surface analysis.
