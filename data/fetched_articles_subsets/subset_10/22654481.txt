Resveratrol, a stilbenic compound deriving from the phenyalanine/polymalonate 
route, being stilbene synthase the last and key enzyme of this pathway, recently 
has become the focus of a number of studies in medicine and plant physiology. 
Increased demand for this molecule for nutraceutical, cosmetic and possibly 
pharmaceutic uses, makes its production a necessity. In this context, the use of 
biotechnology through recombinant microorganisms and plants is particularly 
promising. Interesting results can indeed arise from the potential of 
genetically modified microorganisms as an alternative mechanism for producing 
resveratrol. Strategies used to tailoring yeast as they do not possess the genes 
that encode for the resveratrol pathway, will be described. On the other hand, 
most interest has centered in recent years, on STS gene transfer experiments 
from various origins to the genome of numerous plants. This work also presents a 
comprehensive review on plant molecular engineering with the STS gene, resulting 
in disease resistance against microorganisms and the enhancement of the 
antioxidant activities of several fruits in transgenic lines.
