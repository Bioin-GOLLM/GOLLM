Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding type VII collagen, COL7A1, are 
the molecular basis of the blistering skin disorder, recessive dystrophic 
epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). COL7A1 maps to a region of the short arm of 
chromosome 3 that has been found to be deleted in many types of malignancies. We 
have characterized the first case of a large genomic deletion in chromosome 
3p21.31 that removes COL7A1 entirely in an RDEB patient. This interstitial 
deletion spans 255 to 520 kb and encompasses 9 to 15 genes, but seems to have no 
pathological consequences other than RDEB. We show that the second, hemizygous 
allele of COL7A1 in this patient bears a base substitution within exon 94, 
c.7245G>A. This translates into an amino acid substitution, p.M2415I, and leads 
to a complex splicing abnormality that allows marginal levels of functional mRNA 
and protein to be synthesized. We propose that the leakiness of the splicing 
defect enables the partial rescue of collagen VII deficiency. This is consistent 
with the diagnosis of the moderately severe form of RDEB in the proband, at 
variance with the most severe form, RDEB Hallopeau-Siemens, that would arise 
from complete collagen VII deficiency.
