Despite being the frontline therapy for type 2 diabetes, the mechanisms of 
action of the biguanide drug metformin are still being discovered. In 
particular, the detailed molecular interplays between the AMPK and the mTORC1 
pathway in the hepatic benefits of metformin are still ill defined. 
Metformin-dependent activation of AMPK classically inhibits mTORC1 via TSC/RHEB, 
but several lines of evidence suggest additional mechanisms at play in metformin 
inhibition of mTORC1. Here we investigated the role of direct AMPK-mediated 
serine phosphorylation of RAPTOR in a new RaptorAA mouse model, in which AMPK 
phospho-serine sites Ser722 and Ser792 of RAPTOR were mutated to alanine. 
Metformin treatment of primary hepatocytes and intact murine liver requires AMPK 
regulation of both RAPTOR and TSC2 to fully inhibit mTORC1, and this regulation 
is critical for both the translational and transcriptional response to 
metformin. Transcriptionally, AMPK and mTORC1 were both important for regulation 
of anabolic metabolism and inflammatory programs triggered by metformin 
treatment. The hepatic transcriptional response in mice on high-fat diet treated 
with metformin was largely ablated by AMPK deficiency under the conditions 
examined, indicating the essential role of this kinase and its targets in 
metformin action in vivo.
