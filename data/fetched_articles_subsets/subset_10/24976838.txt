BACKGROUND: Treatment with Peginterferon Alpha-2b plus Ribavirin is the current 
standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, many host related and 
viral parameters are associated with different outcomes of combination therapy.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an artificial neural network 
(ANN) model to predetermine individual responses to therapy based on patient's 
demographics and laboratory data.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in Tehran, Iran, on 
139 patients divided into sustained virologic response (SVR) (n = 50), relapse 
(n = 50) and non-response (n = 39) groups according to their response to 
combination therapy for 48 weeks. The ANN was trained 300 times (epochs) using 
clinical data. To test the ANN performance, the part of data that was selected 
randomly and not used in training process was entered to the ANN and the outputs 
were compared with real data.
RESULTS: Hemoglobin (P < 0.001), cholesterol (P = 0.001) and IL-28b genotype (P 
= 0.002) values had significant differences between the three groups. 
Significant predictive factor(s) for each group were hemoglobin for SVR (OR: 
1.517; 95% CI: 1.233-1.868; P < 0.001), IL-28b genotype for relapse (OR: 0.577; 
95% CI: 0.339-0.981; P = 0.041) and hemoglobin (OR: 0.824; 95% CI: 0.693-0.980; 
P = 0.017) and IL-28b genotype (OR: 2.584; 95% CI: 1.430-4.668;P = 0.001) for 
non-response. The accuracy of ANN to predict SVR, relapse and non-response were 
93%, 90%, and 90%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Using baseline laboratory data and host characteristics, ANN has 
been shown as an accurate model to predict treatment outcome, which can lead to 
appropriate decision making and decrease the frequency of ineffective treatment 
in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
