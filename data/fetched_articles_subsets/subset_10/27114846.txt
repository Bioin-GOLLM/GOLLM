Reversible regulation of proteins by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an 
important mechanism of neuronal plasticity. In particular, ROS have been shown 
to act as modulatory molecules of ion channels-which are key to neuronal 
excitability-in several physiological processes. However ROS are also 
fundamental contributors to aging vulnerability. When the level of excess ROS 
increases in the cell during aging, DNA is damaged, proteins are oxidized, 
lipids are degraded and more ROS are produced, all culminating in significant 
cell injury. From this arose the idea that oxidation of ion channels by ROS is 
one of the culprits for neuronal aging. Aging-dependent oxidative modification 
of voltage-gated potassium (K(+)) channels was initially demonstrated in the 
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and more recently in the mammalian brain. 
Specifically, oxidation of the delayed rectifier KCNB1 (Kv2.1) and of Ca(2+)- 
and voltage sensitive K(+) channels have been established suggesting that their 
redox sensitivity contributes to altered excitability, progression of healthy 
aging and of neurodegenerative disease. Here I discuss the implications that 
oxidation of K(+) channels by ROS may have for normal aging, as well as for 
neurodegenerative disease.
