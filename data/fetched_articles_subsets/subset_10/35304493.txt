Identification of individuals at high risk for rapid progression of motor and 
cognitive signs in Parkinson disease (PD) is clinically significant. Postural 
instability and gait dysfunction (PIGD) are associated with greater motor and 
cognitive deterioration. We examined the relationship between baseline clinical 
factors and the development of postural instability using 5-year longitudinal 
de-novo idiopathic data (n = 301) from the Parkinson's Progressive Markers 
Initiative (PPMI). Logistic regression analysis revealed baseline features 
associated with future postural instability, and we designated this cohort the 
emerging postural instability (ePI) phenotype. We evaluated the resulting ePI 
phenotype rating scale validity in two held-out populations which showed a 
significantly higher risk of postural instability. Emerging PI phenotype was 
identified before onset of postural instability in 289 of 301 paired 
comparisons, with a median progression time of 972 days. Baseline cognitive 
performance was similar but declined more rapidly in ePI phenotype. We provide 
an ePI phenotype rating scale (ePIRS) for evaluation of individual risk at 
baseline for progression to postural instability.
