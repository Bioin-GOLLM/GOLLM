Seventy-two A. fumigatus clinical isolates from China were investigated for 
azole resistance based on mutations of cyp51A. We identified four 
azole-resistant strains, among which we found three strains highly resistant to 
itraconazole, two of which exhibit the TR34/L98H/S297T/F495I mutation, while one 
carries only the TR34/L98H mutation. To our knowledge, the latter has not been 
found previously in China. The fourth multiazole-resistant isolate (with only 
moderate itraconazole resistance) carries a new G432A mutation.
