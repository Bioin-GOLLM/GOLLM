Rapamycin is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immunosuppressant and 
anticancer agent discovered in the soil of Easter Island in the early 1970s. 
Rapamycin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the mechanistic target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase, which acts as a central integrator of nutrient 
signaling pathways. During the last decade, genetic and pharmaceutical 
inhibition of mTOR pathway signaling has been found to promote longevity in 
yeast, worms, flies, and mice. In this article, we will discuss the molecular 
biology underlying the effects of rapamycin and its physiological effects, 
evidence for rapamycin as an antiaging compound, mechanisms by which rapamycin 
may extend life span, and the potential limitations of rapamycin as an antiaging 
molecule. Finally, we will discuss possible strategies that may allow us to 
inhibit mTOR signaling safely while minimizing side effects, and reap the 
health, social, and economic benefits from slowing the aging process.
