BACKGROUND: The complexity of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) cannot be 
characterized by acquired somatic mutations alone. Individual genetic background 
is thought to contribute to the development of MPNs. The aim of our study was to 
assess the association between the TET2 rs1548483 single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) and the susceptibility to polycythemia vera (PV), essential 
thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML).
METHODS: We evaluated the TET2 rs1548483 SNP through real-time PCR in 1601 MPN 
patients out of which 431 with PV, 688 with TE, 233 with PMF, 249 with CML and 
197 controls. We included only patients with a molecularly proven driver 
mutation, such as JAK2 V617F, CALR or BCR-ABL1.
RESULTS: Significant association between TET2 rs154843 variant allele and JAK2 
V617F-positive PV and PMF (OR = 1.70; 95% CI: 1.01-2.91; p-value = 0.046, and OR 
= 2.04; 95% CI: 1.10-3.77; p-value = 0.024, respectively), and type 2 
CALR-positive PMF (OR = 2.98; 95% CI: 1.12-7.93; p-value = 0.035) was noted.
CONCLUSIONS: The TET2 rs1548483 SNP is associated with the susceptibility to 
molecularly annotated PV and PMF.
