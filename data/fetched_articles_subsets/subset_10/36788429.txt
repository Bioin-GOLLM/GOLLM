High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and lethal ovarian cancer 
subtype. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have become the mainstay of HGSC-targeted 
therapy, given that these tumors are driven by a high degree of genomic 
instability (GI) and homologous recombination (HR) defects. Nonetheless, 
approximately 30% of patients initially respond to treatment, ultimately 
relapsing with resistant disease. Thus, despite recent advances in drug 
development and an increased understanding of genetic alterations driving HGSC 
progression, mortality has not declined, highlighting the need for novel 
therapies. Using a small-molecule activator of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A; 
SMAP-061), we investigated the mechanism by which PP2A stabilization induces 
apoptosis in patient-derived HGSC cells and xenograft (PDX) models alone or in 
combination with PARPi. We uncovered that PP2A genes essential for cellular 
transformation (B56α, B56γ, and PR72) and basal phosphatase activity (PP2A-A and 
-C) are heterozygously lost in the majority of HGSC. Moreover, loss of these 
PP2A genes correlates with worse overall patient survival. We show that 
SMAP-061-induced stabilization of PP2A inhibits the HR output by targeting 
RAD51, leading to chronic accumulation of DNA damage and ultimately apoptosis. 
Furthermore, combination of SMAP-061 and PARPi leads to enhanced apoptosis in 
both HR-proficient and HR-deficient HGSC cells and PDX models. Our studies 
identify PP2A as a novel regulator of HR and indicate PP2A modulators as a 
therapeutic therapy for HGSC. In summary, our findings further emphasize the 
potential of PP2A modulators to overcome PARPi insensitivity, given that 
targeting RAD51 presents benefits in overcoming PARPi resistance driven by 
BRCA1/2 mutation reversions.
