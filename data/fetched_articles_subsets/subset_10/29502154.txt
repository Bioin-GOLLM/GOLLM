BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UGT2B7 C802T and CYP3A4*1G 
impact drug metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the impact of these SNPs 
on the efficacy of oxycontin for pain relief in cancer patients.
METHODS: A total of 57 Han Chinese cancer patients (age range 20-70 years) who 
received oxycontin to ease pain for the first time were enrolled and divided 
into two groups (refractory group and remission group) according to pain relief. 
Peripheral blood samples were collected from each patient for sequencing 
analysis. The genotype and allele frequency between the two groups were analyzed 
using the chi-square test.
RESULTS: The T allele frequency of UGT2B7 C802T was 25% among all participants, 
but was higher (32%) in the refractory group (P = 0.047). The variant allele 
frequency of CYP3A4*1G was 27% and did not differ between the refractory group 
and remission group.
CONCLUSION: The palliative effect of oxycontin is better in patients with UGT2B7 
802CC than in those with 802TT. CYP3A4*1G SNP is unlikely to affect pain relief 
efficacy of oxycontin.
