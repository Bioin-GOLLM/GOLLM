Graphene Oxide has been proposed as a potential adjuvant to develop improved 
anti-TB treatment, thanks to its activity in entrapping mycobacteria in the 
extracellular compartment limiting their entry in macrophages. Indeed, when 
administered together with linezolid, Graphene Oxide significantly enhanced 
bacterial killing due to the increased production of Reactive Oxygen Species. In 
this work, we evaluated Graphene Oxide toxicity and its anti-mycobacterial 
activity on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our data show that 
Graphene Oxide, different to what is observed in macrophages, does not support 
the clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human immune primary cells, 
probably due to the toxic effects of the nano-material on monocytes and CD4+ 
lymphocytes, which we measured by cytometry. These findings highlight the need 
to test GO and other carbon-based nanomaterials in relevant in vitro models to 
assess the cytotoxic activity while measuring antimicrobial potential.
