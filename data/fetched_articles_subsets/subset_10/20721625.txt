BACKGROUND: A G/C polymorphism in miRNA-146a (rs2910164) was shown to be 
associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the associations of the miR-146a G/C 
(rs2910164) and TLR4 +3725 G/C (rs11536889) polymorphisms with the risk of 
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, gastric atrophy, and gastric cancer 
in a Japanese population.
METHODS: Subjects for this study were 583 histologically diagnosed gastric 
cancer patients and age- and sex-frequency-matched 1,742 control outpatients 
(1,637 subjects were eligible for the analyses), who visited Aichi Cancer Center 
Hospital from the year 2001 to 2005. Serum pepsinogens were measured to evaluate 
gastric atrophy.
RESULTS: When H. pylori-seropositive subjects or subjects with gastric atrophy 
were defined as H. pylori-infected subjects, the age- and sex-adjusted odds 
ratio (aOR) of severe gastric atrophy among the H. pylori infected was 1.44 (95% 
confidence interval [95% CI]=0.89-2.34, p=0.133) in G/G genotype of miR-146a 
polymorphism. When combined with TLR4 G/C polymorphism, the OR in those with 
miR-146a G/G and TLR4 G/C+C/C genotypes was significantly increased relative to 
those with miR-146a C/C+G/C and TLR4 G/G among the H. pylori-infected subjects: 
aOR=2.04 (95% CI=1.10-3.82, p=0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the combined effect of miR-146a rs2910164 G/G 
and TLR4 +3725 C allele on the increased risk of severe gastric atrophy among 
the H. pylori-infected Japanese subjects.
