Compounds targeting the circadian clock have been identified as potential 
treatments for clock-related diseases, including cancer. Our cell-based 
phenotypic screen revealed uncharacterized clock-modulating compounds. Through 
affinity-based target deconvolution, we identified GO289, which strongly 
lengthened circadian period, as a potent and selective inhibitor of CK2. 
Phosphoproteomics identified multiple phosphorylation sites inhibited by GO289 
on clock proteins, including PER2 S693. Furthermore, GO289 exhibited cell 
type-dependent inhibition of cancer cell growth that correlated with cellular 
clock function. The x-ray crystal structure of the CK2Î±-GO289 complex revealed 
critical interactions between GO289 and CK2-specific residues and no direct 
interaction of GO289 with the hinge region that is highly conserved among 
kinases. The discovery of GO289 provides a direct link between the circadian 
clock and cancer regulation and reveals unique design principles underlying 
kinase selectivity.
