BACKGROUND: tDCS is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has been 
reported to improve motor skill learning after stroke. However, the contribution 
of tDCS to motor skill learning has only been investigated in a small number of 
studies. In addition, it is unclear if tDCS effects are mediated by 
activity-dependent BDNF release and dependent on timing of tDCS relative to 
training.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate the role of activity-dependent BDNF release and timing of 
tDCS relative to training in motor skill learning.
METHODS: Double-blind, between-subjects randomized controlled trial of circuit 
tracing task improvement (ΔMotor skill) in 80 chronic stroke patients who 
underwent tDCS and were genotyped for BDNF Val66Met. Patients received either 
short-lasting tDCS (20 min) during training (short-lasting online group), 
long-lasting tDCS (10 min-25 min break - 10 min) one day before training 
(long-lasting offline group), short-lasting tDCS one day before training 
(short-lasting offline group), or sham tDCS. ΔMotor skill was defined as the 
skill difference on the circuit tracing task between day one and day nine of the 
study.
RESULTS: Having at least one BDNF Met allele was found to diminish ΔMotor skill 
(βBDNF,Met = -0.217 95%HDI = [-0.431 -0.0116]), indicating activity-dependent 
BDNF release is important for motor skill learning after stroke. However, none 
of the tDCS protocols affected ΔMotor skill (βShort-lasting,online = 0.0908 
95%HDI = [-0.227 0.403]; βLong-lasting,offline = 0.0242 95%HDI = [-0.292 0.349]; 
βShort-lasting,offline = -0.108 95%HDI = [-0.433 0.210]).
CONCLUSION: BDNF Val66Met is a determinant of motor skill learning after stroke 
and could be important for prognostic models. tDCS does not modulate motor skill 
learning in our study and might be less effective than previously assumed.
