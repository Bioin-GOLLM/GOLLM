Patients with chronic lung disease are vulnerable to getting severe diseases 
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we describe protocols for 
subculturing and differentiating primary normal human bronchial epithelial 
(NHBE) cells of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. The 
differentiation of NHBE cells in air-liquid interface mimics an in vivo airway 
and provides an in vitro model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also 
describe a protocol for detecting proteins in the sectioned epithelium for 
detailing SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced pathobiology with a vertical view.
