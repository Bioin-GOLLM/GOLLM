BACKGROUND: The lethal group of short-rib polydactyly (SRP) includes type I 
(Saldino-Noonan; MIM 263530), type II (Majewski; MIM 263520), type III 
(Verma-Naumoff; MIM 263510) and type IV (Beemer-Langer; MIM 269860). Jeune and 
Ellis-van Creveld dysplasias also used to be classified in the SRP group. 
Recently, mutations in a gene encoding a protein involved in intraflagellar 
transport, IFT80, have been identified in 3/39 patients with Jeune dysplasia but 
no extraskeletal manifestation.
METHODS: Because of clinical and radiological similarities between Jeune 
dysplasia and the other lethal types of SRP, the authors decided to investigate 
IFT80 in a cohort of fetuses with the lethal forms of SRP (Majewski, 
Verma-Naumoff and Beemer-Langer) and antenatally diagnosed cases of Jeune 
dysplasia. Fifteen fetuses were identified. A double-molecular approach was 
adopted. For consanguineous families and for those with recurrent sibs, a 
haplotype analysis around the gene locus was first performed, and, for the 
others, all the coding exons of IFT80 were directly sequenced.
RESULTS: Using the haplotype approach for two families, the authors excluded the 
IFT80 region as a candidate for them. Direct sequencing of IFT80 in the other 13 
cases showed a G-to-C transversion in exon 8 (G241R) in only one SRP case 
closely related to the type III phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that mutations in IFT80 can also be responsible 
for a lethal form of SRP and provide the molecular basis for the 
Jeune-Verma-Naumoff dysplasia spectrum.
