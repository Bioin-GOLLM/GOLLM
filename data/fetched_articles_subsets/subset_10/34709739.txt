BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) arises from a rare population of 
aberrant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). These cells are 
relatively quiescent and therefore treatment resistant. Understanding mechanisms 
underlying their maintenance is critical for effective MDS treatment.
METHODS: We evaluated microRNA-126 (miR-126) levels in MDS patients' sample and 
in a NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) murine MDS model along with their normal controls and 
defined its role in MDS HSPCs' maintenance by inhibiting miR-126 expression in 
vitro and in vivo. Identification of miR-126 effectors was conducted using 
biotinylated miR-126 pulldown coupled with transcriptome analysis. We also 
tested the therapeutic activity of our anti-miR-126 oligodeoxynucleotide 
(miRisten) in human MDS xenografts and murine MDS models.
RESULTS: miR-126 levels were higher in bone marrow mononuclear cells from MDS 
patients and NHD13 mice relative to their respective normal controls 
(P < 0.001). Genetic deletion of miR-126 in NHD13 mice decreased quiescence and 
self-renewal capacity of MDS HSPCs, and alleviated MDS symptoms of NHD13 mice. 
Ex vivo exposure to miRisten increased cell cycling, reduced colony-forming 
capacity, and enhanced apoptosis in human MDS HSPCs, but spared normal human 
HSPCs. In vivo miRisten administration partially reversed pancytopenia in NHD13 
mice and blocked the leukemic transformation (combination group vs DAC group, 
P < 0.0001). Mechanistically, we identified the non-coding RNA PTTG3P as a novel 
miR-126 target. Lower PTTG3P levels were associated with a shorter overall 
survival in MDS patients.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-126 plays crucial roles in MDS HSPC maintenance. Therapeutic 
targeting of miR-126 is a potentially novel approach in MDS.
