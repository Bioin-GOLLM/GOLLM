Faithful chromosome segregation in meiosis requires crossover (CO) 
recombination, which is regulated to ensure at least one CO per homolog pair. We 
investigate the failure to ensure COs in juvenile male mice. By monitoring 
recombination genome-wide using cytological assays and at hotspots using 
molecular assays, we show that juvenile mouse spermatocytes have fewer COs 
relative to adults. Analysis of recombination in the absence of MLH3 provides 
evidence for greater utilization in juveniles of pathways involving 
structure-selective nucleases and alternative complexes, which can act upon 
precursors to generate noncrossovers (NCOs) at the expense of COs. We propose 
that some designated CO sites fail to mature efficiently in juveniles owing to 
inappropriate activity of these alternative repair pathways, leading to 
chromosome mis-segregation. We also find lower MutLγ focus density in juvenile 
human spermatocytes, suggesting that weaker CO maturation efficiency may explain 
why younger men have a higher risk of fathering children with Down syndrome.
