BACKGROUND: As new infectious diseases (ID) emerge and others continue to 
mutate, there remains an imminent threat, especially for vulnerable individuals. 
Yet no generalizable framework exists to identify the at-risk group prior to 
infection. Metabolomics has the advantage of capturing the existing physiologic 
state, unobserved via current clinical measures. Furthermore, metabolomics 
profiling during acute disease can be influenced by confounding factors such as 
indications, medical treatments, and lifestyles.
METHODS: We employed metabolomic profiling to cluster infection-free individuals 
and assessed their relationship with COVID severity and influenza 
incidence/recurrence.
FINDINGS: We identified a metabolomic susceptibility endotype that was strongly 
associated with both severe COVID (ORICUadmission = 6.7, p-value = 1.2 × 10-08, 
ORmortality = 4.7, p-value = 1.6 × 10-04) and influenza (ORincidence = 2.9; 
p-values = 2.2 × 10-4, βrecurrence = 1.03; p-value = 5.1 × 10-3). We observed 
similar severity associations when recapitulating this susceptibility endotype 
using metabolomics from individuals during and after acute COVID infection. We 
demonstrate the value of using metabolomic endotyping to identify a 
metabolically susceptible group for two-and potentially more-IDs that are driven 
by increases in specific amino acids, including microbial-related metabolites 
such as tryptophan, bile acids, histidine, polyamine, phenylalanine, and 
tyrosine metabolism, as well as carbohydrates involved in glycolysis.
INTERPRETATIONS: These metabolites may be identified prior to infection to 
enable protective measures for these individuals.
FUNDING: The Longitudinal EMR and Omics COVID-19 Cohort (LEOCC) and metabolomic 
profiling were supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and 
the Intramural Research Program of the National Center for Advancing 
Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health.
