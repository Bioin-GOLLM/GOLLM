Vestibular hair cells are mechanosensory receptors that are capable of detecting 
changes in head position and thereby allow animals to maintain their posture and 
coordinate their movement. Vestibular hair cells are susceptible to ototoxic 
drugs, aging, and genetic factors that can lead to permanent vestibular 
dysfunction. Vestibular dysfunction mainly results from the injury of hair 
cells, which are located in the vestibular sensory epithelium. This review 
summarizes the mechanisms of different factors causing vestibular hair cell 
damage and therapeutic strategies to protect vestibular hair cells.
