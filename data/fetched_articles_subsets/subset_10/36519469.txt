BACKGROUND: The endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) is a fundamental 
process for heart valve formation and defects in EndoMT cause aortic valve 
abnormalities. Our previous genome-wide association study identified multiple 
variants in a large chromosome 8 segment as significantly associated with 
bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The objective of this study is to determine the 
biological effects of this large noncoding segment in human induced pluripotent 
stem cell (hiPSC)-based EndoMT.
METHODS: A large genomic segment enriched for BAV-associated variants was 
deleted in hiPSCs using 2-step CRISPR/Cas9 editing. To address the effects of 
the variants on GATA4 expression, we generated CRISPR repression hiPSC lines 
(CRISPRi) as well as hiPSCs from BAV patients. The resulting hiPSCs were 
differentiated to mesenchymal/myofibroblast-like cells through 
cardiovascular-lineage endothelial cells for molecular and cellular analysis. 
Single-cell RNA sequencing was also performed at different stages of EndoMT 
induction.
RESULTS: The large deletion impaired hiPSC-based EndoMT in multiple biallelic 
clones compared with their isogenic control. It also reduced GATA4 transcript 
and protein levels during EndoMT, sparing the other genes nearby the deletion 
segment. Single-cell trajectory analysis revealed the molecular reprogramming 
during EndoMT. Putative GATA-binding protein targets during EndoMT were 
uncovered, including genes implicated in endocardial cushion formation and 
EndoMT process. Differentiation of cells derived from BAV patients carrying the 
rs117430032 variant as well as CRISPRi repression of the rs117430032 locus 
resulted in lower GATA4 expression in a stage-specific manner. TWIST1 was 
identified as a potential regulator of GATA4 expression, showing specificity to 
the locus tagged by rs117430032.
CONCLUSIONS: BAV-associated distal regions regulate GATA4 expression during 
hiPSC-based EndoMT, which in turn promotes EndoMT progression, implicating its 
contribution to heart valve development.
