BACKGROUND: Theophylline was shown to induce contracture development in porcine 
malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptible (MHS) skeletal muscles in vitro. The 
purpose of the current study was to investigate the in vivo effects of 
theophylline in MHS and MH normal (MHN) swine.
METHODS: MH-trigger-free general anesthesia was performed in MHS and MHN swine. 
Theophylline was administered intravenously in cumulative doses up to 
93.5 mg·kg⁻¹. The clinical occurrence of MH was defined by changes of 
central-venous pCO₂, central-venous pH, and body core temperature.
RESULTS: Theophylline induced comparable clinical alterations in the 
anesthetized MHS and MHN swine, especially in regard to hemodynamic data. No pig 
developed hypermetabolism and/or MH according to defined criteria. All animals 
died with tachycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation.
CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative theophylline doses used in this study were much 
higher than doses used therapeutically in humans, as demonstrated by measured 
blood concentrations. Theophylline is thus not a trigger of MH in genetically 
determined swine.
