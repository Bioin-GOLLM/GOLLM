The lysosomal storage disorder, GM1 gangliosidosis (GM1), is a neurodegenerative 
condition resulting from deficiency of the enzyme β-galactosidase (β-gal). 
Mutation of the GLB1 gene, which codes for β-gal, prevents cleavage of the 
terminal β-1,4-linked galactose residue from GM1 ganglioside. Subsequent 
accumulation of GM1 ganglioside and other substrates in the lysosome impairs 
cell physiology and precipitates dysfunction of the nervous system. Beyond 
palliative and supportive care, no FDA-approved treatments exist for GM1 
patients. Researchers are critically evaluating the efficacy of substrate 
reduction therapy, pharmacological chaperones, enzyme replacement therapy, stem 
cell transplantation, and gene therapy for GM1. A Phase I/II clinical trial for 
GM1 children is ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adeno-associated 
virus-mediated GLB1 delivery by intravenous injection, providing patients and 
families with hope for the future.
