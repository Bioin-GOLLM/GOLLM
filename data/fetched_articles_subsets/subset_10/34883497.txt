Host genetic factors can confer resistance against malaria1, raising the 
question of whether this has led to evolutionary adaptation of parasite 
populations. Here we searched for association between candidate host and 
parasite genetic variants in 3,346 Gambian and Kenyan children with severe 
malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. We identified a strong association 
between sickle haemoglobin (HbS) in the host and three regions of the parasite 
genome, which is not explained by population structure or other covariates, and 
which is replicated in additional samples. The HbS-associated alleles include 
nonsynonymous variants in the gene for the acyl-CoA synthetase family member2-4 
PfACS8 on chromosome 2, in a second region of chromosome 2, and in a region 
containing structural variation on chromosome 11. The alleles are in strong 
linkage disequilibrium and have frequencies that covary with the frequency of 
HbS across populations, in particular being much more common in Africa than 
other parts of the world. The estimated protective effect of HbS against severe 
malaria, as determined by comparison of cases with population controls, varies 
greatly according to the parasite genotype at these three loci. These findings 
open up a new avenue of enquiry into the biological and epidemiological 
significance of the HbS-associated polymorphisms in the parasite genome and the 
evolutionary forces that have led to their high frequency and strong linkage 
disequilibrium in African P. falciparum populations.
