Protein transcription, translation, and folding occur continuously in every 
living cell and are essential for physiological functions. About one-third of 
all proteins of the cellular proteome interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER). The ER is a large, dynamic cellular organelle that orchestrates synthesis, 
folding, and structural maturation of proteins, regulation of lipid metabolism 
and additionally functions as a calcium store. Recent evidence suggests that 
both acute and chronic hypercapnia (elevated levels of CO2) impair ER function 
by different mechanisms, leading to adaptive and maladaptive regulation of 
protein folding and maturation. In order to cope with ER stress, cells activate 
unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Initially, during the adaptive phase 
of ER stress, the UPR mainly functions to restore ER protein-folding homeostasis 
by decreasing protein synthesis and translation and by activation of 
ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and autophagy. However, if the initial UPR 
attempts for alleviating ER stress fail, a maladaptive response is triggered. In 
this review, we discuss the distinct mechanisms by which elevated CO2 levels 
affect these molecular pathways in the setting of acute and chronic pulmonary 
diseases associated with hypercapnia.
