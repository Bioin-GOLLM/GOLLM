Nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HAp) is similar to human bone mineral in structure and 
biochemistry and is, therefore, widely used as bone biomaterial and a drug 
carrier. Further, n-HAp composite scaffolds have a great potential role in bone 
regeneration. Loading bioactive factors and drugs onto n-HAp composites has 
emerged as a promising strategy for bone defect repair in bone tissue 
engineering. With local delivery of bioactive agents and drugs, biological 
materials may be provided with the biological activity they lack to improve bone 
regeneration. This review summarizes classification of n-HAp composites, 
application of n-HAp composite scaffolds loaded with bioactive factors and drugs 
in bone tissue engineering and the drug loading methods of n-HAp composite 
scaffolds, and the research direction of n-HAp composite scaffolds in the future 
is prospected.
