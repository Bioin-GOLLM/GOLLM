BACKGROUND: Carvedilol is commonly used to treat hypertension as a β- and 
α1-adrenoreceptor blocker, but it is metabolized by CYP2D6, and CYP2D6*10 allele 
is dominant in Asian population. The objective of this study was to assess the 
influence of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of carvedilol in healthy Korean volunteers.
METHODS: A PK/PD study for a single and multiple dosing of carvedilol were 
conducted. All volunteers in 3 genotypic groups received single oral dose of 
carvedilol 12.5 mg for 3 days, then 25 mg QD for 5 days, and 12.5 mg QD for 
another 3 days. PK parameters for carvedilol and its three metabolites were 
determined using non-compartmental analysis. For PD properties, blood pressure, 
heart rate, and the chronotropic dose 25 (CD25) value were obtained.
RESULTS: The IM_2 group with two *10 alleles (intermediate metabolizers) 
exhibited lower clearance of carvedilol as well as higher area under the curve 
(AUC) for O-desmethyl carvedilol. The ratio of CD25 to baseline at multiple 
dosing was significantly higher in the combined IM group (IM_1 and IM_2) than in 
the EM group, however, the ratio of CD25 after single and multiple dosing and 
the other PD markers were not significantly different between the 3 genotypic 
groups compared with the baseline.
CONCLUSION: These findings showed that CYP2D6 genotype influenced the PK 
characteristics of carvedilol and no differences in PD response were observed in 
Korean healthy volunteers. Registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02286934.
