Extracellular cytokines are enriched in the tumor microenvironment and regulate 
various important properties of cancers, including autophagy. However, the 
precise molecular mechanisms underlying the link between autophagy and 
extracellular cytokines remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we 
demonstrate that IL-6 activates autophagy through the IL-6/JAK2/BECN1 pathway 
and promotes chemotherapy resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC). 
Mechanistically, IL-6 triggers the interaction between JAK2 and BECN1, where 
JAK2 phosphorylates BECN1 at Y333. We demonstrate that BECN1 Y333 
phosphorylation is crucial for BECN1 activation and IL-6-induced autophagy by 
regulating PI3KC3 complex formation. Furthermore, we investigate BECN1 Y333 
phosphorylation as a predictive marker for poor CRC prognosis and chemotherapy 
resistance. Combination treatment with autophagy inhibitors or pharmacological 
agents targeting the IL-6/JAK2/BECN1 signaling pathway may represent a potential 
strategy for CRC cancer therapy.
