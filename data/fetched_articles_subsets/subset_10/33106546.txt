In a meta-analysis of three GWAS for susceptibility to Kawasaki disease (KD) 
conducted in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan and follow-up studies with a total of 
11,265 subjects (3428 cases and 7837 controls), a significantly associated SNV 
in the immunoglobulin heavy variable gene (IGHV) cluster in 14q33.32 was 
identified (rs4774175; OR = 1.20, P = 6.0 × 10-9). Investigation of 
nonsynonymous SNVs of the IGHV cluster in 9335 Japanese subjects identified the 
C allele of rs6423677, located in IGHV3-66, as the most significant reproducible 
association (OR = 1.25, P = 6.8 × 10-10 in 3603 cases and 5731 controls). We 
observed highly skewed allelic usage of IGHV3-66, wherein the rs6423677 A allele 
was nearly abolished in the transcripts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 
both KD patients and healthy adults. Association of the high-expression allele 
with KD strongly indicates some active roles of B-cells or endogenous 
immunoglobulins in the disease pathogenesis. Considering that significant 
association of SNVs in the IGHV region with disease susceptibility was 
previously known only for rheumatic heart disease (RHD), a complication of acute 
rheumatic fever (ARF), these observations suggest that common B-cell related 
mechanisms may mediate the symptomology of KD and ARF as well as RHD.
