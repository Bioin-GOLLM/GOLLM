OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the common rs8111699 (C528G) variant in STK11 is 
related to metabolic risk markers in pregnant women and to gestational diabetes 
mellitus (GDM).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Hospital.
PATIENT(S): A total of 561 pregnant women: 318 without and 243 with GDM 
(National Diabetes Data Group criteria).
INTERVENTION(S): None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES(S): rs8111699 variant in STK11 (Taqman technology). 
Fasting glucose, insulin (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and 
β-cell function [HOMA-IR and -β]) and C-peptide assessed at 24-28 weeks' 
gestation.
RESULT(S): In non-GDM women, the G allele in rs8111699 was associated with lower 
HOMA-IR (CC: 1.3 ± 0.1 mIU/L; GG: 0.9 ± 0.1 mIU/L) and HOMA-β (CC: 165 ± 20 
mIU/L; GG: 118 ± 10 mIU/L). In GDM women, the G allele was related to lower body 
mass index (BMI; CC: 27.9 ± 1.0 kg/m(2); GG: 24.5 ± 0.6 kg/m(2)) and C-peptide 
(CC: 2.3 ± 0.1 ng/mL; GG: 1.6 ± 0.1 ng/mL). The GG genotype was less frequently 
observed in GDM women (18% vs. 26%), particularly in heavier GDM women (BMI > 
median: 14% vs. 28%).
CONCLUSION(S): In pregnant women, the G allele for the rs8111699 variant in 
STK11 is associated with a more favorable metabolic phenotype and may protect 
against the development of GDM, particularly in heavier women.
