BACKGROUND: Genetics is a major etiological contributor to autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD). Environmental factors, however, also appear to contribute. ASD 
pathophysiology due to gene x environment is also beginning to be explored. One 
reason to focus on environmental factors is that they may allow opportunities 
for intervention or prevention.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Herein, we review two such factors that have been 
associated with a significant proportion of ASD risk, prenatal stress exposure 
and maternal immune dysregulation. Maternal stress susceptibility appears to 
interact with prenatal stress exposure to affect offspring neurodevelopment. We 
also explore how maternal stress may interact with the microbiome in the 
neurodevelopmental setting. Additionally, understanding of the impact of 
maternal immune dysfunction on ASD has recently been advanced by recognition of 
specific fetal brain proteins targeted by maternal autoantibodies, and 
identification of unique mid-gestational maternal immune profiles. This might 
also be interrelated with maternal stress exposure. Animal models have been 
developed to explore pathophysiology targeting each of these factors.
CONCLUSION: We are beginning to understand the behavioral, pharmacopathological, 
and epigenetic effects related to these interactions, and we are beginning to 
explore potential mitigating factors. Continued growth in understanding of these 
mechanisms may ultimately allow for the identification of multiple potential 
targets for prevention or intervention for this subset of 
environmental-associated ASD cases.
