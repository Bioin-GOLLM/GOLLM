Background: HFE p.C282Y (chromosome 6p22.2; exon 4, c.845G>A; rs1800562), a 
hemochromatosis-associated polymorphism in European Americans, is absent in 
sub-Saharan West African blacks. Methods: We estimated European American 
ancestry in African Americans (M) using published p.C282Y allele frequencies of 
sub-Saharan West African blacks; and ≥50 unselected African Americans and ≥50 
unselected European Americans in the same city/region. Results: p.C282Y allele 
frequency in 870 West African blacks (The Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, 
Sierra Leone) was 0.0000 (confidence interval [95% CI 0.0000-0.0027]). p.C282Y 
allele frequencies in European Americans were 0.0600 (12,592 participants; five 
single-site studies) and 0.0673 (54,882 participants; two multisite studies). 
p.C282Y allele frequencies in African Americans were 0.0102 (3084 participants; 
five single-site studies) and 0.0122 (30,762 participants; two multisite 
studies). M for all data was 0.1803 (standard error 0.0049; [95% CI 
0.1706-0.1900]). City/region estimates of M differed 1.8-fold: 0.1321, 
Rochester, NY; 0.1456, Birmingham, AL; 0.1569, Upper Savannah Region, SC; 
0.1612, Portland, OR; 0.1746, San Diego, CA; 0.1780, Hartford, CT; 0.1957, 
District of Columbia; 0.2377, Oakland, CA; and 0.2429, Irvine, CA. Conclusions: 
Estimates of M using p.C282Y are consistent with those using other autosomal 
markers, differ across nine cities/regions, and reflect paternal and maternal 
contributions of European American ancestry in African Americans.
