OBJECTIVE: To explore the molecular etiology for a Chinese family affected with 
isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA).
METHODS: Potential mutations of MUT, MMAA and MMAB genes in the proband were 
screened by PCR and Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity of identified mutations 
was analyzed using Polyphen2, SIFT, HSF, DNAMAN 6.0 and Swiss-PdbViewer4.1.0 
software.
RESULTS: Two novel mutations of the MUT gene, including c.581C>T (p.P194L) and 
c.1219A>T (p.N407Y), were discovered in the proband, which were inherited 
respectively from his mother and father. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that 
both mutations were damaging. The affected codons P194 and N407, both located in 
the (beta, alpha) 8 barrel domain and to which the substrate methylmalonyl-CoA 
is bound, are highly conserved across various species. Both mutations can 
disrupt the space conformation of its protein product, affecting the function of 
the MCM protein.
CONCLUSION: The novel mutations of MUT gene probably underlie the isolated MMA 
in this family.
