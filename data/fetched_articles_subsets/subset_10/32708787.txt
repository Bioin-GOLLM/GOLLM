New pyranocoumarin and coumarin-sulfonamide derivatives were prepared and 
evaluated for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and/or anti-inflammatory 
activities. Coumarin-sulfonamide compounds 8a-d demonstrated significant 
antioxidant activity, while 7c,d, 8c,d, and 9c,d exhibited antimicrobial 
activity equal to or higher than the standard antimicrobials against at least 
one tested microorganism. Regarding the anti-inflammatory testing, 
pyranocoumarins 2b, 3a,b and 5c and coumarin-sulfonamide compound 9a showed more 
potent antiproteinase activity than aspirin in vitro; however, five compounds 
were as potent as aspirin. The anti-inflammatory activity of the promising 
compounds was further assessed pharmacologically on formaldehyde-induced rat paw 
oedema and showed significant inhibition of oedema. For in vitro COX-inhibitory 
activity of coumarin derivatives, pyranocoumarin derivative 5a was the most 
selective (SI = 152) and coumarin-sulfonamide derivative 8d was most active 
toward COX-2 isozyme. The most active derivatives met the in silico criteria for 
orally active drugs; thus, they may serve as promising candidates to develop 
more potent and highly efficient antioxidant, antimicrobial, and/or 
anti-inflammatory agents.
