OBJECTIVES: In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the association between 
common EGFR mutations (Del EX19/L858R) with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(EGFR-TKIs) has been well established. However, this has not been investigated 
for rare EGFR mutations or their impact on treatment response and outcome to 
EGFR TKIs (primary objective) and chemotherapy (secondary objective).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an observational prospective cohort, we analyzed 188 
NSCLC patients from Mexico, Colombia and Costa Rica with EGFR mutations. As a 
first line of treatment, 66.5% received platinum-based chemotherapy. All 
patients received TKIs in first-line treatment or after progression to 
chemotherapy. The clinical-pathological characteristics as well as the f of 
common and rare EGFR mutations associated with treatment response were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of all patients, 79.5% had common and 20.5% had rare EGFR mutations. 
Lepidic and acinar adenocarcinomas were associated with common EGFR mutations 
(p=0.010). Patients with common EGFR mutations had higher response rates to 
EGFR-TKIs than those who had rare EGFR mutations (63.8 vs 32.4%, p<0.001). Women 
had increased progression-free survival (PFS) to EGFR-TKIs than men (16.4 vs 9.5 
months, p=0.02). The median PFS and overall survival (OS) were better in 
patients with common EGFR mutations (15.5 vs 3.9 months, p<0.001; and 37.3 vs 
17.4 months, p<0.001) respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that only patients with rare EGFR mutations 
could receive platinum-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment, due to 
their low response rates and short PFS in response to EGFR-TKIs. Consequently, 
EGFR-TKIs could be reserved as a second- or third-line treatment. In patients 
with EGFR mutations, women have better PFS to EGFR-TKIs than men, and rare EGFR 
mutations are more frequent in high grade adenocarcinomas than in low grade 
tumors.
