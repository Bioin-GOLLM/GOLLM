The Kv1.3 potassium channel is expressed abundantly on activated T cells and 
mediates the cellular immune response. This role has made the channel a target 
for therapeutic immunomodulation to block its activity and suppress T cell 
activation. Here, we report structures of human Kv1.3 alone, with a nanobody 
inhibitor, and with an antibody-toxin fusion blocker. Rather than block the 
channel directly, four copies of the nanobody bind the tetramer's voltage 
sensing domains and the pore domain to induce an inactive pore conformation. In 
contrast, the antibody-toxin fusion docks its toxin domain at the extracellular 
mouth of the channel to insert a critical lysine into the pore. The lysine 
stabilizes an active conformation of the pore yet blocks ion permeation. This 
study visualizes Kv1.3 pore dynamics, defines two distinct mechanisms to 
suppress Kv1.3 channel activity with exogenous inhibitors, and provides a 
framework to aid development of emerging T cell immunotherapies.
