Human growth is a highly complicated process, but it is obviously influenced by 
a genetic factor. Recent genome-wide linkage analyses suggested some genetic 
regions underlying stature variations. However, any specific genes underlying 
stature variations have not been identified. Noonan syndrome (NS) is an 
autosomal dominant disorder clinically characterized by short stature, minor 
facial anomalies, and congenital heart defects. Recently, PTPN11 
(protein-tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor-type 11) has been identified as a 
major responsible gene for NS, causing about half of the affected individuals. 
We herein report a large family demonstrating NS caused by one of the common 
PTPN11 mutations, c.188 A > G (Y63C). In this family, the patients were 
apparently healthy, but heterozygosity of the c.188 A > G (Y63C) mutation was 
related to growth impairment. This finding suggested that PTPN11 genetic 
variants contribute to adult height in the general population. However, c.188 A 
> G (Y63C) was not identified in 96 short individuals from the general 
population of 2,281 healthy adults. Thus, it is unlikely that PTPN11 is one of 
the genes underlying stature variations in the general population.
