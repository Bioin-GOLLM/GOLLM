Sequencing errors continue to pose algorithmic challenges to methods working 
with sequencing data. One of the simplest and most prevalent techniques for 
ameliorating the detrimental effects of homopolymer expansion/contraction errors 
present in long reads is homopolymer compression. It collapses runs of repeated 
nucleotides, to remove some sequencing errors and improve mapping sensitivity. 
Though our intuitive understanding justifies why homopolymer compression works, 
it in no way implies that it is the best transformation that can be done. In 
this paper, we explore if there are transformations that can be applied in the 
same pre-processing manner as homopolymer compression that would achieve better 
alignment sensitivity. We introduce a more general framework than homopolymer 
compression, called mapping-friendly sequence reductions. We transform the 
reference and the reads using these reductions and then apply an alignment 
algorithm. We demonstrate that some mapping-friendly sequence reductions lead to 
improved mapping accuracy, outperforming homopolymer compression.
