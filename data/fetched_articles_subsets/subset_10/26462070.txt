To date, mitochondrial DNA polymerase Î³ (POLG) is the only polymerase known to 
be present in mammalian mitochondria. A dogma in the mitochondria field is that 
there is no other polymerase present in the mitochondria of mammalian cells. 
Here we demonstrate localization of REV3 DNA polymerase in the mammalian 
mitochondria. We demonstrate localization of REV3 in the mitochondria of 
mammalian tissue as well as cell lines. REV3 associates with POLG and 
mitochondrial DNA and protects the mitochondrial genome from DNA damage. 
Inactivation of Rev3 leads to reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced 
OXPHOS activity, and increased glucose consumption. Conversely, inhibition of 
the OXPHOS increases expression of Rev3. Rev3 expression is increased in human 
primary breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines. Inactivation of Rev3 
decreases cell migration and invasion, and localization of Rev3 in mitochondria 
increases survival and the invasive potential of cancer cells. Taken together, 
we demonstrate that REV3 functions in mammalian mitochondria and that 
mitochondrial REV3 is associated with the tumorigenic potential of cells.
