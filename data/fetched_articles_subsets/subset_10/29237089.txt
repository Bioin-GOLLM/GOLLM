BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION: Sarcoidosis is a multi-systemic disorder of unknown 
etiology, characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas in target 
organs. In 90% of cases, there is thoracic involvement. Fifty to seventy percent 
of pulmonary sarcoidosis patients will experience acute, self-limiting disease. 
For the subgroup of patients who develop persistent disease, no targeted therapy 
is currently available.
AIM: To investigate the potential of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 
Toll-like receptor 3 Leu412Phe (TLR3 L412F; rs3775291), as a causative factor in 
the development of and in disease persistence in pulmonary sarcoidosis. To 
investigate the functionality of TLR3 L412F in vitro in primary human lung 
fibroblasts from pulmonary sarcoidosis patients.
DESIGN: SNP-genotyping and cellular assays, respectively, were used to 
investigate the role of TLR3 L412F in the development of persistent pulmonary 
sarcoidosis.
METHODS: Cohorts of Irish sarcoidosis patients (n = 228), healthy Irish controls 
(n = 263) and a secondary cohort of American sarcoidosis patients (n = 123) were 
genotyped for TLR3 L412F. Additionally, the effect of TLR3 L412F in primary lung 
fibroblasts from pulmonary sarcoidosis patients was quantitated following TLR3 
activation in the context of cytokine and type I interferon production, TLR3 
expression and apoptotic- and fibroproliferative-responses.
RESULTS: We report a significant association between TLR3 L412F and persistent 
clinical disease in two cohorts of Irish and American Caucasians with pulmonary 
sarcoidosis. Furthermore, activation of TLR3 in primary lung fibroblasts from 
412 F-homozygous pulmonary sarcoidosis patients resulted in reduced IFN-β and 
TLR3 expression, reduced apoptosis- and dysregulated 
fibroproliferative-responses compared with TLR3 wild-type patients.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This study identifies defective TLR3 function as a 
previously unidentified factor in persistent clinical disease in pulmonary 
sarcoidosis and reveals TLR3 L412F as a candidate biomarker.
