Hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 are responsible for 
cell entry, with E2 being the major target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). 
Here, we present a comprehensive strategy for B cell-based HCV vaccine 
development through E2 optimization and nanoparticle display. We redesigned 
variable region 2 in a truncated form (tVR2) on E2 cores derived from genotypes 
1a and 6a, resulting in improved stability and antigenicity. Crystal structures 
of three optimized E2 cores with human cross-genotype NAbs (AR3s) revealed how 
the modified tVR2 stabilizes E2 without altering key neutralizing epitopes. We 
then displayed these E2 cores on 24- and 60-meric nanoparticles and achieved 
substantial yield and purity, as well as enhanced antigenicity. In mice, these 
nanoparticles elicited more effective NAb responses than soluble E2 cores. 
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) defined distinct B cell patterns associated 
with nanoparticle-induced antibody responses, which target the conserved 
neutralizing epitopes on E2 and cross-neutralize HCV genotypes.
