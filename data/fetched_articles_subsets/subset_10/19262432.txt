PURPOSE: The eye provides a unique window into the neural and vascular health of 
a patient with diabetes. The present study is the first of its kind to examine 
the neural retinal function, structure, and retinal vascular health in 
adolescents with Type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: Focal neural responses from 103 discrete retinal regions of the eye 
were tested using multifocal electroretinography. Optical coherence tomography 
was utilized to measure retinal thickness. Digital fundus photographs were 
examined for the presence of retinopathy and to measure vascular caliber using 
retinal vessel analysis. Fifteen adolescents diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, 
aged 13 to 21 years with a mean diabetes duration of 2.1 +/- 1.3 years, were 
tested. Twenty-six age-matched control subjects were also tested.
RESULTS: Multifocal electroretinograms of the Type 2 diabetic group were 
significantly (P = 0.03) delayed by 0.49 milliseconds. The diabetic group also 
showed significant (both; P < or = 0.03) retinal thinning (10.3 microm) and 
significant venular dilation (16.2 microm).
CONCLUSION: The present study shows early indications of focal retinal 
neuropathy, retinal thinning, and venular dilation in adolescents with Type 2 
diabetes. Early detection of functional and structural changes will hopefully 
aid in the prevention of permanent damage or further functional loss.
