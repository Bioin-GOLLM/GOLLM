Fibrotic diseases result in organ remodelling and dysfunctional failure and 
account for one-third of all deaths worldwide. There are no ideal treatments 
that can halt or reverse progressive organ fibrosis, moreover, organ 
transplantation is complicated by problems with a limited supply of donor organs 
and graft rejection. The development of new approaches, especially induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based therapy, is becoming a hot topic due to their 
ability to self-renew and differentiate into different cell types that may 
replace the fibrotic organs. In the past decade, studies have differentiated 
iPSCs into fibrosis-relevant cell types which were demonstrated to have 
anti-fibrotic effects that may have the potential to inform new effective 
precision treatments for organ-specific fibrosis. In this review, we summarize 
the potential of iPSC-based cellular approaches as therapeutic avenues for 
treating organ fibrosis, the advantages and disadvantages of iPSCs compared with 
other types of stem cell-based therapies, as well as the challenges and future 
outlook in this field.
