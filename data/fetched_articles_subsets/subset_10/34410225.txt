Despite recent advances in elucidating molecular pathways underlying 
adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), this orphan malignancy is associated with poor 
survival. Identification of targetable genomic alterations is critical to 
improve outcomes. The objective of this study was to characterize the genomic 
profile of a large cohort of patient ACC samples to identify actionable genomic 
alterations. Three hundred sixty-four individual patient ACC tumors were 
analyzed. The median age of the cohort was 52 years and 60.9% (n = 222) were 
female. ACC samples had common alterations in epigenetic pathways with 38% of 
tumors carrying alterations in genes involved in histone modification, 21% in 
telomere lengthening, and 21% in SWI/SNF complex. Tumor suppressor genes and WNT 
signaling pathway were each mutated in 51% of tumors. Fifty (13.7%) ACC tumors 
had a genomic alteration in genes involved in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) 
pathway with many tumors also displaying an unusually high number of mutations 
and a corresponding MMR mutation signature. In addition, genomic alterations in 
several genes not previously associated with ACC were observed, including IL7R, 
LRP1B, FRS2 mutated in 6, 8 and 4% of tumors, respectively. In total, 58.5% of 
ACC (n = 213) had at least one potentially actionable genomic alteration in 46 
different genes. As more than half of ACC have one or more potentially 
actionable genomic alterations, this highlights the value of targeted sequencing 
for this orphan cancer with a poor prognosis. In addition, significant incidence 
of MMR gene alterations suggests that immunotherapy is a promising therapeutic 
for a considerable subset of ACC patients.
