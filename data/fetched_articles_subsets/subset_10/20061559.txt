event in the progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Somatic mutations in TET2 occur in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms 
and other hematologic malignancies. It has been suggested that TET2 is a tumor 
suppressor gene and mutations in TET2 precede the acquisition of JAK2-V617F. To 
examine the order of events, we performed colony assays and genotyped TET2 and 
JAK2 in individual colonies. In 4 of 8 myeloproliferative neoplasm patients, we 
found that some colonies with mutated TET2 carried wild-type JAK2, whereas 
others were JAK2-V617F positive, indicating that TET2 occurred before 
JAK2-V617F. One of these patients carried a germline TET2 mutation. However, in 
2 other patients, we obtained data compatible with the opposite order of events, 
with JAK2 exon 12 mutation preceding TET2 mutation in one case. Finally, in 2 of 
8 patients, the TET2 and JAK2-V617F mutations defined 2 separate clones. The 
lack of a strict temporal order of occurrence makes it unlikely that mutations 
in TET2 represent a predisposing event for acquiring mutations in JAK2.
