Recent outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), including Ebola virus 
disease (EVD) and Lassa fever (LF), highlight the urgent need for sensitive, 
deployable tests to diagnose these devastating human diseases. Here we develop 
CRISPR-Cas13a-based (SHERLOCK) diagnostics targeting Ebola virus (EBOV) and 
Lassa virus (LASV), with both fluorescent and lateral flow readouts. We 
demonstrate on laboratory and clinical samples the sensitivity of these assays 
and the capacity of the SHERLOCK platform to handle virus-specific diagnostic 
challenges. We perform safety testing to demonstrate the efficacy of our HUDSON 
protocol in heat-inactivating VHF viruses before SHERLOCK testing, eliminating 
the need for an extraction. We develop a user-friendly protocol and mobile 
application (HandLens) to report results, facilitating SHERLOCK's use in endemic 
regions. Finally, we successfully deploy our tests in Sierra Leone and Nigeria 
in response to recent outbreaks.
