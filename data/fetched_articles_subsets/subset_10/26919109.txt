Similarities in gene expression between both developing embryonic and 
precancerous tissues and cancer tissues may help identify much-needed biomarkers 
and therapeutic targets in lung squamous carcinoma. In this study, human lung 
samples representing ten successive time points, from embryonic development to 
carcinogenesis, were used to construct global gene expression profiles. 
Differentially expressed genes with similar expression in precancerous and 
cancer samples were identified. Using a network-based greedy searching algorithm 
to analyze the training cohort (n = 69) and three independent testing cohorts, 
we successfully identified a significant 22-gene module in which expression 
levels were correlated with overall survival in lung squamous carcinoma 
patients.
