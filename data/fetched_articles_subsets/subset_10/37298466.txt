Skin diseases such as psoriasis (Ps) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are 
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Overlap of autoinflammatory and 
autoimmune conditions hinders diagnoses and identifying personalized patient 
treatments due to different psoriasis subtypes and the lack of verified 
biomarkers. Recently, proteomics and metabolomics have been intensively 
investigated in a broad range of skin diseases with the main purpose of 
identifying proteins and small molecules involved in the pathogenesis and 
development of the disease. This review discusses proteomics and metabolomics 
strategies and their utility in research and clinical practice in psoriasis and 
psoriasis arthritis. We summarize the studies, from in vivo models conducted on 
animals through academic research to clinical trials, and highlight their 
contribution to the discovery of biomarkers and targets for biological drugs.
