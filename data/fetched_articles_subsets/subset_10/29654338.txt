In the field of metabolic engineering 13C-based metabolic flux analysis 
experiments have proven successful in indicating points of action. As every step 
of this approach is affected by an inherent error, the aim of the present work 
is the comprehensive evaluation of factors contributing to the uncertainty of 
nonnaturally distributed C-isotopologue abundances as well as to the absolute 
flux value calculation. For this purpose, a previously published data set, 
analyzed in the course of a 13C labeling experiment studying glycolysis and the 
pentose phosphate pathway in a yeast cell factory, was used. Here, for 
isotopologue pattern analysis of these highly polar metabolites that occur in 
multiple isomeric forms, a gas chromatographic separation approach with 
preceding derivatization was used. This rendered a natural isotope interference 
correction step essential. Uncertainty estimation of the resulting 
C-isotopologue distribution was performed according to the EURACHEM guidelines 
with Monte Carlo simulation. It revealed a significant increase for 
low-abundance isotopologue fractions after application of the necessary 
correction step. For absolute flux value estimation, isotopologue fractions of 
various sugar phosphates, together with the assessed uncertainties, were used in 
a metabolic model describing the upper part of the central carbon metabolism. 
The findings pinpointed the influence of small isotopologue fractions as sources 
of error and highlight the need for improved model curation. Graphical abstract
