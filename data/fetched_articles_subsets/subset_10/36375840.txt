Although recent advances in gene therapy provide hope for spinal muscular 
atrophy (SMA) patients, the pathology remains the leading genetic cause of 
infant mortality. SMA is a monogenic pathology that originates from the loss of 
the SMN1 gene in most cases or mutations in rare cases. Interestingly, several 
SMN1 mutations occur within the TUDOR methylarginine reader domain of SMN. We 
hypothesized that in SMN1 mutant cases, SMA may emerge from aberrant 
protein-protein interactions between SMN and key neuronal factors. Using a BioID 
proteomic approach, we have identified and validated a number of SMN-interacting 
proteins, including fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) family members 
(FMRFM). Importantly, SMA-linked SMNTUDOR mutant forms (SMNST) failed to 
interact with FMRFM In agreement with the recent work, we define biochemically 
that SMN forms droplets in vitro and these droplets are stabilized by RNA, 
suggesting that SMN could be involved in the formation of membraneless 
organelles, such as Cajal nuclear bodies. Finally, we found that SMN and FMRP 
co-fractionate with polysomes, in an RNA-dependent manner, suggesting a 
potential role in localized translation in motor neurons.
