Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), which is a protein 
characterized by its potent proliferation promoting activity, has been well 
studied in the area of growth and tumorigenesis. However, the specific role of 
TCTP in liver regeneration (LR) and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In 
order to investigate the contribution of TCTP during LR, heterozygous TCTP mice 
were generated, and a mimic LR model was applied to TCTP-knockdown (KD) hepatic 
cell lines. The results revealed that TCTP-KD impaired LR in mice, and 
manifested as the following aspects: delayed proliferation of hepatocytes, 
accompanied by disruption of the mRNA expression of markers of the cell cycle, 
degenerated lipid metabolism, and abnormal immune response. Furthermore, it was 
found out that TCTP activated PI3K/AKT signaling by regulating mTORC2. Lastly, 
the increasing rate of serum TCTP positively correlated to the recovery of 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) after liver 
resection in humans. In summary, the present study is the first to reveal the 
crucial role of intracellular TCTP in LR.
