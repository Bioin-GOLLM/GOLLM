BACKGROUND: Medium-chain fatty acids and their 3-hydroxy derivatives are 
metabolites endogenously produced in humans, food-derived or originating from 
bacteria. They activate G protein-coupled receptors, including GPR84 and HCA3, 
which regulate metabolism and immune functions. Although both receptors are 
coupled to Gi proteins, share at least one agonist and show overlapping tissue 
expression, GPR84 exerts pro-inflammatory effects whereas HCA3 is involved in 
anti-inflammatory responses. Here, we analyzed signaling kinetics of both HCA3 
and GPR84, to unravel signal transduction components that may explain their 
physiological differences.
METHODS: To study the signaling kinetics and components involved in signal 
transduction of both receptors we applied the label-free dynamic mass 
redistribution technology in combination with classical cAMP, ERK signaling and 
β-arrestin-2 recruitment assays. For phenotypical analyses, we used spheroid 
cell culture models.
RESULTS: We present strong evidence for a natural biased signaling of 
structurally highly similar agonists at HCA3 and GPR84. We show that HCA3 
signaling and trafficking depends on dynamin-2 function. Activation of HCA3 by 
3-hydroxyoctanoic acid but not 3-hydroxydecanoic acid leads to β-arrestin-2 
recruitment, which is relevant for cell-cell adhesion. GPR84 stimulation with 
3-hydroxydecanoic acid causes a sustained ERK activation but activation of GPR84 
is not followed by β-arrestin-2 recruitment.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results highlight that biased agonism is a 
physiological property of HCA3 and GPR84 with relevance for innate immune 
functions potentially to differentiate between endogenous, non-pathogenic 
compounds and compounds originating from e.g. pathogenic bacteria. Video
