BACKGROUND: Existing clinical studies supported the potential efficacy of 
mesenchymal stromal cells as well as derived exosomes in the treatment of 
COVID-19. We aimed to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of 
the exosomes derived from human adipose-derived MSCs (haMSC-Exos) in patients 
with COVID-19.
METHODS: The MEXCOVID trial is a phase 2a single-arm, open-labelled, 
interventional trial and patients were enrolled in Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, 
China. Eligible 7 patients were assigned to receive the daily dose of 
haMSCs-Exos (2.0 × 108 nano vesicles) for consecutively 5 days. The primary 
outcomes included the incidence of prespecified inhalation-associated events and 
serious adverse events. We also observed the demographic data, clinical 
characteristics, laboratory results including lymphocyte count, levels of 
D-dimer and IL-6 as well as chest imaging.
RESULTS: Seven severe COVID-19 related pneumonia patients (4 males and 3 
females) were enrolled and received nebulized haMSC-Exos. The median age was 
57 year (interquartile range (IQR), 43 year to 70 year). The median time from 
onset of symptoms to hospital admission and administration of nebulized 
haMSC-Exos was 30 days (IQR, 15 days to 40 days) and 54 d (IQR, 34 d to 69 d), 
respectively. All COVID-19 patients tolerated the haMSC-Exos nebulization well, 
with no evidence of prespecified adverse events or clinical instability during 
the nebulization or during the immediate post-nebulization period. All patients 
presented a slight increase of serum lymphocyte counts (median as 1.61 × 109/L 
vs. 1.78 × 109/L). Different degrees of resolution of pulmonary lesions after 
aerosol inhalation of haMSC-Exos were observed among all patients, more 
obviously in 4 of 7 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our trial shows that a consecutive 5 days inhalation dose of 
clinical grade haMSC-Exos up to a total amount of 2.0 × 109 nano vesicles was 
feasible and well tolerated in seven COVID-19 patients, with no evidence of 
prespecified adverse events, immediate clinical instability, or dose-relevant 
toxicity at any of the doses tested. This safety profile is seemingly followed 
by CT imaging improvement within 7 days. Further trials will have to confirm the 
long-term safety or efficacy in larger population.
