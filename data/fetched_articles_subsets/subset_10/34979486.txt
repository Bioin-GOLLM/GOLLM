PURPOSE: MALT lymphoma is thought to have a genetic component. Genetic studies 
in the greek population are rare and genetic determinants remain to be 
established. The current study aimed to seek correlations between genetic 
polymorphisms and risk of MALT lymphoma in the Greek population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 83 MALT lymphoma patients and 60 age-matched healthy 
outpatients were recruited. SNPs in TNFa, LTA and CTLA-4 genes and IL1RN-VNTR 
and GSTT1 and GSTTM1 null polymorphisms were genotyped using published 
PCR/PCR-RFLP methods, while two novel PCR-RFLP methods were developed for IL-22 
rs7314777 and TCF19 rs7750641 SNPs. Part of the results was validated by 
DNA-sequencing. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and the SNPstats 
bioinformatic tool.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients and controls were 55.9 and 56.2 years 
respectively. The majority of patients (63) suffered gastric marzinal zone 
lymphoma (GMZL) and 71.1% were stage I at diagnosis. A statistically significant 
association was noted for the CTLA-4 49A/ G G variant (OR:2.56,p: 0.006) and the 
TCF19 rs7750641 SNP T variant (OR: 3.86, p:0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed a role for CTLA-4 49A/G and TCF19 rs7750641 
SNPs in the Greek population. Additional studies could help confirm these 
associations and possibly link them to prognosis or response to treatment 
parameters.
