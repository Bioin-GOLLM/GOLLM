Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individuals with familial 
hypercholesterolemia (FH) have a risk for CVD due to a high LDL-C value. Lp(a) 
also increases the CVD risk in FH individuals; thus, the Lp(a) value should be 
carefully managed. The LDL-C value may partly include Lp(a)-cholesterol 
(Lp(a)-C) in the measurement. Based on the LDL-C value, some individuals are 
likely misclassified as having FH and/or the status of treatment of FH can be 
monitored. The present review describes about Lp(a) in FH individuals in terms 
of the measurement issue of Lp(a) and the related management of FH.
