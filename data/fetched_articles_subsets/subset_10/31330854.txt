Diet quality plays an important role in dementia prevention. It remains unclear 
how the joint effect of vegetable variety and diet quality affects cognition. 
This study aimed to explore the association of diet quality and vegetable 
variety with cognitive decline in older adults. This prospective cohort study 
(2011-2015) included 436 community-dwelling elders in Taipei. Diet quality, 
assessed by the modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index (mAHEI), was computed 
from a food frequency questionnaire at baseline (2011-2013). Vegetable variety 
indicated the number of different vegetable groups, adjusted for vegetable 
quantity. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to 
explore the association of diet quality and vegetable variety with the decline 
of global and domain-specific cognition over two years. Our findings suggest 
that high diet quality (the highest tertile of mAHEI) was associated with a 
lower risk of both global cognitive decline (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.54, 
confidence interval (CI) = 0.31-0.95) and decline of attention domain (AOR = 
0.56, CI = 0.32-0.99) compared with low diet quality. In elders with high 
vegetable variety, high diet quality was associated with a lower risk of global 
cognitive decline (AOR = 0.49, CI = 0.26-0.95). We therefore concluded that high 
diet quality along with diverse vegetable intake was associated with a lower 
risk of cognitive decline in older adults.
