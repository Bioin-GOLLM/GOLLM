Glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetase in fetal, adult and neoplastic rat 
tissues.

Huang YZ, Knox EW.

Three enzyme reactions related to asparagine synthesis were studied in rat 
tissues: formation of aspartylhydroxamate, either from aspartate or by transfer 
from asparagine, and actual synthesis of asparagine from aspartate. Actual 
asparagine synthesis occurred at one-thousandth the rate of the other two 
reactions. Optimal conditions for quantitative assay of asparagine synthesis 
were determined in fetal liver extract, which is a rich source of the enzyme. 
Demonstrable activity in liver fell 6 days after birth to 20% of the fetal value 
and decreased slowly thereafter to the low adult value. Adult pancreas was the 
most active tissue found. The asparagine synthetase of fetal liver extracts was 
significantly inhibited when combined with adult liver or tumor extracts. The 
inhibitor fractionated with ammonium sulfate in close association with the 
asparagine synthetase. Therefore, demonstrable activities of asparagine 
synthetase in tissue extracts, measured in the presence of this inhibitor, do 
not necessarily parallel the concentrations of the enzyme present.
