Genetic and pharmacological intervention studies have identified evolutionarily 
conserved and functionally interconnected networks of cellular energy 
homeostasis, nutrient-sensing, and genome damage response signaling pathways, as 
prominent regulators of longevity and health span in various species. 
Mitochondria are the primary sites of ATP production and are key players in 
several other important cellular processes. Mitochondrial dysfunction diminishes 
tissue and organ functional performance and is a commonly considered feature of 
the aging process. Here we review the evidence that through reciprocal and 
multilevel functional interactions, mitochondria are implicated in the lifespan 
modulation function of these pathways, which altogether constitute a highly 
dynamic and complex system that controls the aging process. An important 
characteristic of these pathways is their extensive crosstalk and apparent 
malleability to modification by non-invasive pharmacological, dietary, and 
lifestyle interventions, with promising effects on lifespan and health span in 
animal models and potentially also in humans.
