Fat deposition, which influences pork production, meat quality and growth 
efficiency, is an economically important trait in pigs. Numerous studies have 
demonstrated that stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a key enzyme that catalyzes the 
conversion of saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids, is 
associated with fatty acid composition in pigs. As SCD was observed to be 
significantly induced in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation, we hypothesized 
that it plays a role in porcine adipocyte differentiation and fat deposition. In 
this study, we revealed that SCD is highly expressed in adipose tissues from 
seven-day-old piglets, compared to its expression in tissues from four-month-old 
adult pigs. Moreover, we found that SCD and lipogenesis-related genes were 
induced significantly in differentiated porcine adipocytes. Using CRISPR/Cas9 
technology, we generated SCD-/- porcine embryonic fibroblasts (PEFs) and found 
that the loss of SCD led to dramatically decreased transdifferentiation 
efficiency, as evidenced by the decreased expression of known lipid 
synthesis-related genes, lower levels of oil red O staining and significantly 
lower levels of triglyceride content. Our study demonstrates the critical role 
of SCD expression in porcine adipocyte differentiation and paves the way for 
identifying it as the promising candidate gene for less fat deposition in pigs.
