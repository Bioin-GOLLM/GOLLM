A relationship between the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and behavioral and 
attitudinal trust has been suggested, but the nature of this relationship has 
not yet been established. We obtained behavioral trust data from 470 Japanese 
participants (242 women) aged 20-59 years, together with their levels of general 
trust and personality traits (NEO-FFI). Saliva buccal swabs were collected from 
411 of these 470 participants and used for genotyping of OXTR rs53576. Our 
participants were found to have more AA alleles (40%) than GG alleles (12%). The 
GG men were more trusting and also rated higher on attitudinal trust than AA 
men, and this difference did not diminish when personality traits were 
controlled for. However, this pattern was not observed among women. In addition, 
controlling for attitudinal trust reduced the difference in behavioral trust 
among men to a non-significant level, but the difference in attitudinal trust 
remained significant when behavioral trust was controlled. These results 
indicate that the OXTR genotype affects attitudinal trust as part of an 
individual's relatively stable disposition, and further affects behavioral trust 
through changes in attitudinal trust.
