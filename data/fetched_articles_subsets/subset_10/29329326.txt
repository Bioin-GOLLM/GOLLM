To date, IL-17A antibodies remain the only therapeutic approach to correct the 
abnormal activation of the IL-17A/IL-17R signaling complex. Why is it that 
despite the remarkable success of IL-17 antibodies, there is no small molecule 
antagonist of IL-17A in the clinic? Here we offer a unique approach to address 
this question. In order to understand the interaction of IL-17A with its 
receptor, we combined peptide discovery using phage display with HDX, 
crystallography, and functional assays to map and characterize hot regions that 
contribute to most of the energetics of the IL-17A/IL-17R interaction. These 
functional maps are proposed to serve as a guide to aid in the development of 
small molecules that bind to IL-17A and block its interaction with IL-17RA.
