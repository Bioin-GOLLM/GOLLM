Acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone) is the major bioactive component of 
the traditional Chinese medicine "Snow lotus". As a natural flavonoid compound, 
it has been shown to have good pharmacological effects such as 
anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and anti-obesity. Among them, its prominent role 
in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has received extensive attention from scholars 
in recent years. In this review, the protective effects of acacetin on a variety 
of cardiovascular diseases, as well as the existing problems and prospects, are 
discussed and summarized. This review also highlights the great potential of 
acacetin, a natural-derived Chinese medicine, as a cardiovascular agent 
candidate.
