PURPOSE: Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2, and signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3) play an important role in Th1 and Th17 differentiation 
and gene polymorphisms of these factors have been demonstrated to be associated 
with certain autoimmune diseases. The present study was performed to assess the 
association between JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3 polymorphisms and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada 
(VKH) syndrome in a Han Chinese population.
METHODS: A case-control study was performed in 737 Chinese VKH syndrome patients 
and 809 healthy controls from a Han Chinese population. The genotypes of three 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs310230, rs310236, rs310241) in JAK1 
were performed using an SNP genotyping system. Three SNPs (rs10758669, 
rs7857730, rs10119004) in JAK2 and four SNPs (rs6503695, rs744166, rs2293152, 
and rs12948909) in STAT3 were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction 
restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
(HWE) was tested using the χ(2) test. Genotype frequencies were estimated 
through direct counting. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between 
patients and controls using the χ(2) test.
RESULTS: There was no deviation from the HWE in all controls tested. Three SNPs, 
including rs310230, rs310236, and rs310241, in JAK1 were significantly 
associated with VKH syndrome (Pc = 0.008, 0.005, 0.001, respectively). None of 
the tested SNPs of JAK2 and STAT3 was associated with VKH syndrome. 
Stratification analysis according to headache, dysacusis, alopecia, poliosis, 
and vitiligo for VKH syndrome did not reveal an association.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that JAK1 genetic polymorphisms, but not JAK2 
and STAT3, are associated with the susceptibility to VKH syndrome.
