BACKGROUND: HIV infection has commonly been found to affect lipid profile and 
antioxidant defense.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
infection and viral subtype on patient's cholesterol and oxidative stress 
markers, and determine whether in the absence of Highly Active Antiretroviral 
Therapy (HAART), these biochemical parameters could be useful in patient's 
management and monitoring disease progression in Cameroon. For this purpose, we 
measured total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDLC), HDL cholesterol (HDLC), 
total antioxidant ability (TAA), lipid peroxidation indices (LPI), and 
malondialdehyde (MDA) in HIV negative persons and HIV positive HAART-naïve 
patients infected with HIV-1 group M subtypes.
METHODS: We measured serum TC, LDLC, HDLC, plasma MDA, and TAA concentrations, 
and calculated LPI indices in 151 HIV-positive HAART-naïve patients and 134 
seronegative controls. We also performed gene sequence analysis on samples from 
30 patients to determine the effect of viral genotypes on these biochemical 
parameters. We also determined the correlation between CD4 cell count and the 
above biochemical parameters.
RESULTS: We obtained the following controls/patients values for TC (1.96±0.54/1. 
12±0. 48 g/l), LDLC (0. 67±0. 46/0. 43±0. 36 g/l), HDLC (105. 51±28. 10/46. 
54±23. 36 mg/dl) TAA (0. 63±0. 17/0. 16±0. 16 mM), MDA (0. 20±0. 07/0. 41±0. 10 
µM) and LPI (0. 34±0. 14/26. 02±74. 40). In each case, the difference between 
the controls and patients was statistically significant (p<0.05). There was a 
positive and statistically significant Pearson correlation between CD4 cell 
count and HDLC (r = +0.272; p<0.01), TAA (r = +0.199; p<0.05) and a negative and 
statistically significant Pearson correlation between CD4 cell count and LPI 
(r = -0.166; p<0.05). Pearson correlation between CD4 cell count and TC, CD4cell 
count and LDLC was positive but not statistically significant while it was 
negative but not statistically significant with MDA. The different subtypes 
obtained after sequencing were CRF02_AG (43.3%), CRF01_AE (20%), A1 (23.3%), H 
(6.7%), and G (6.7%). None of the HIV-1 subtypes significantly influenced the 
levels of the biochemical parameters, but by grouping them as pure subtypes and 
circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), the CRF significantly influenced TC 
levels. TC was significantly lower in patients infected with CRF (0.87±0.27 g/l) 
compared to patients infected with pure HIV-1 subtypes (1.32±0.68 g/l) 
(p<0.017). MDA levels were also significantly higher in patients infected with 
HIV-1CRF01_AE (0.50±0.10 µM), compared to patients infected with CRF02_AG (0. 
38±0. 08 µM) (p<0.018).
CONCLUSION: These results show that HIV infection in Cameroon is associated with 
significant decrease in TAA, LDLC, HDLC and TC, and increased MDA concentration 
and LPI indices which seem to be linked to the severity of HIV infection as 
assessed by CD4 cell count. The data suggests increased oxidative stress and 
lipid peroxidation in HIV-infected patients in Cameroon, and an influence of 
CRFs on TC and MDA levels.
