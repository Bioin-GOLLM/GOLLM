Stimulation of TNFR1 by TNFα can promote three distinct alternative mechanisms 
of cell death: necroptosis, RIPK1-independent and -dependent apoptosis. How 
cells decide which way to die is unclear. Here, we report that TNFα-induced 
phosphorylation of RIPK1 in the intermediate domain by TAK1 plays a key role in 
regulating this critical decision. Using phospho-Ser321 as a marker, we show 
that the transient phosphorylation of RIPK1 intermediate domain induced by TNFα 
leads to RIPK1-independent apoptosis when NF-κB activation is inhibited by 
cycloheximide. On the other hand, blocking Ser321 phosphorylation promotes RIPK1 
activation and its interaction with FADD to mediate RIPK1-dependent apoptosis 
(RDA). Finally, sustained phosphorylation of RIPK1 intermediate domain at 
multiple sites by TAK1 promotes its interaction with RIPK3 and necroptosis. 
Thus, absent, transient and sustained levels of TAK1-mediated RIPK1 
phosphorylation may represent distinct states in TNF-RSC to dictate the 
activation of three alternative cell death mechanisms, RDA, RIPK1-independent 
apoptosis and necroptosis.TNFα can promote three distinct mechanisms of cell 
death: necroptosis, RIPK1-independent and dependent apoptosis. Here the authors 
show that TNFα-induced phosphorylation of RIPK1 in the intermediate domain by 
TAK1 plays a key role in regulating this decision.
