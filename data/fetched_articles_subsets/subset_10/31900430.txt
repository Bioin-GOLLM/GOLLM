Normal development of cortical circuits, including experience-dependent cortical 
maturation and plasticity, requires precise temporal regulation of gene 
expression and molecular signaling. Such regulation, and the concomitant impact 
on plasticity and critical periods, is hypothesized to be disrupted in 
neurodevelopmental disorders. A protein that may serve such a function is the 
MET receptor tyrosine kinase, which is tightly regulated developmentally in 
rodents and primates, and exhibits reduced cortical expression in autism 
spectrum disorder and Rett Syndrome. We found that the peak of MET expression in 
developing mouse cortex coincides with the heightened period of synaptogenesis, 
but is precipitously downregulated prior to extensive synapse pruning and 
certain peak periods of cortical plasticity. These results reflect a potential 
on-off regulatory synaptic mechanism for specific glutamatergic cortical 
circuits in which MET is enriched. In order to address the functional 
significance of the 'off' component of the proposed mechanism, we created a 
controllable transgenic mouse line that sustains cortical MET signaling. 
Continued MET expression in cortical excitatory neurons disrupted synaptic 
protein profiles, altered neuronal morphology, and impaired visual cortex 
circuit maturation and connectivity. Remarkably, sustained MET signaling 
eliminates monocular deprivation-induced ocular dominance plasticity during the 
normal cortical critical period; while ablating MET signaling leads to early 
closure of critical period plasticity. The results demonstrate a novel mechanism 
in which temporal regulation of a pleiotropic signaling protein underlies 
cortical circuit maturation and timing of cortical critical period, features 
that may be disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders.
