Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a conserved mechanism of Ca2+ influx that 
regulates Ca2+ signaling in many cell types. SOCE is activated by depletion of 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores in response to physiological agonist 
stimulation. After it was first postulated by J.W. Putney Jr. in 1986, SOCE has 
been described in a large number of non-excitable cell types including secretory 
cells of different exocrine glands. Here we discuss the mechanisms by which SOCE 
controls salt and fluid secretion in exocrine glands, with a special focus on 
eccrine sweat glands. In sweat glands, SOCE plays an important, non-redundant 
role in regulating the function of Ca2+-activated Cl- channels (CaCC), Cl- 
secretion and sweat production. In the absence of key regulators of SOCE such as 
the CRAC channel pore subunit ORAI1 and its activator STIM1, the Ca2+-activated 
chloride channel TMEM16A is inactive and fails to secrete Cl-, resulting in 
anhidrosis in mice and human patients.
