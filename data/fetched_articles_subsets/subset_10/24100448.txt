We analyzed candidate platelet function disorder genes in 13 index cases with a 
history of excessive bleeding in association with a significant reduction in 
dense granule secretion and impaired aggregation to a panel of platelet 
agonists. Five of the index cases also had mild thrombocytopenia. Heterozygous 
alterations in FLI1 and RUNX1, encoding Friend leukemia integration 1 and 
RUNT-related transcription factor 1, respectively, which have a fundamental role 
in megakaryocytopoeisis, were identified in 6 patients, 4 of whom had mild 
thrombocytopenia. Two FLI1 alterations predicting p.Arg337Trp and p.Tyr343Cys 
substitutions in the FLI1 DNA-binding domain abolished transcriptional activity 
of FLI1. A 4-bp deletion in FLI1, and 2 splicing alterations and a nonsense 
variation in RUNX1, which were predicted to cause haploinsufficiency of either 
FLI1 or RUNX1, were also identified. Our findings suggest that alterations in 
FLI1 and RUNX1 may be common in patients with platelet dense granule secretion 
defects and mild thrombocytopenia.
