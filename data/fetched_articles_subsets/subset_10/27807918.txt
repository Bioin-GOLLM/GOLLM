The tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) gene is considered a promising genetic 
candidate regarding its association with a predisposition to major depressive 
disorder (MDD). Local gyrification reflects the early neural development of 
cortical connectivity, and is regarded as a potential neural endophenotype in 
psychiatric disorders. They aimed to investigate the alterations in the cortical 
gyrification of the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and their 
association with the TPH2 rs4570625 polymorphism in patients with MDD. One 
hundred and thirteen patients with MDD and eighty-six healthy controls underwent 
T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging and genotyping for TPH2 
rs4570625. The local gyrification index of 22 cortical regions in the prefrontal 
cortex and anterior cingulate cortex was analyzed using the FreeSurfer. The 
patients with MDD showed significant hypergyria in the right rostral anterior 
cingulate cortex (P = 0.001), medial orbitofrontal cortex (P = 0.003), and 
frontal pole (P = 0.001). There was a significant genotype-by-diagnosis 
interaction for the local gyrification index in the right rostral anterior 
cingulate cortex (P = 0.003). Their study revealed significant hypergyria of the 
anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex and an interactive effect 
between the diagnosis of MDD and the genotype in the anterior cingulate cortex. 
This might be associated with the dysfunction of neural circuits mediating 
emotion processing, which could contribute to pathophysiology of MDD. Hum Brain
