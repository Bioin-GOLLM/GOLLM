Epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3) is a trans-membrane signaling molecule with 
important roles in the regulation of apoptosis, differentiation and invasion of 
cancer cells, but the detailed is largely still unknown. We analyzed the mRNA 
levels and methylation statuses of EMP3 in 63 primary breast carcinomas and 
assessed their correlations with clinicopathologic variables. The expression of 
EMP3 mRNA in primary breast carcinomas was significantly higher than the 
expression of 20 normal breast tissues (p<10(-7)). EMP3 overexpression in breast 
carcinomas was significantly related to histological grade III (p=3.9 x 10(-7)), 
lymph node metastasis (p=0.003), and strong Her-2 expression (p=3.3 x 10(-6)). 
Hypermethylation frequencies of EMP3 were detected in 36.5% of breast carcinomas 
by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. However, no significant 
correlations were found between methylation status of EMP3 and mRNA expression 
levels as well as other clinical parameters. In conclusion, EMP3 may be a novel 
marker of tumor aggressiveness. Overexpression of EMP3 in primary breast 
carcinoma is not associated with DNA methylation.
