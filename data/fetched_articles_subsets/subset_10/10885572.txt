The HLA-DM genes (DMA and DMB) are encoded in the major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) on human chromosome 6. They are involved in the loading of 
antigenic peptide onto class II molecules as part of the class II 
antigen-processing and -presentation pathway. During a study of Oriental 
subjects (11 Chinese and 26 Japanese subjects), one Chinese subject was 
identified as having a new DMB allele using polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). This was confirmed 
with sequencing. The new allele was found to have Glu (GAG) and Thr (ACT) at 
positions 144 and 179 respectively. This was a previously unpublished 
combination of polymorphic sites, and was submitted to GenBank and assigned the 
accession number AF072680, and named HLA-DMB*0106.
