During the past year, disease has shown us the iron grip it can hold over a 
population of people. Health systems can be overwhelmed, economies can be 
brought into recession, and many people can be harmed or killed. When 
weaponized, diseases can be manipulated to create a detriment to health while 
becoming an economic burden on any society. It is consequently prudent that easy 
detection of bioweapons is available to governments for protecting their people. 
Electrochemical sensing displays many distinct advantages, such as its low limit 
of detection, low cost to run, rapid generation of results, and in many 
instances portability. We therefore present a wide array of electrochemical 
sensing platforms currently being fabricated, a brief summary of Class A 
bioweapons, and the potential future of bioweapon detection and biosafety.
