INTRODUCTION: Biomarker discovery of dementia and cognitive impairment is 
important to gather insight into mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these 
conditions.
METHODS: In 997 adults from the InCHIANTI study, we assessed the association of 
1301 plasma proteins with dementia and cognitive impairment. Validation was 
conducted in two Alzheimer's disease (AD) case-control studies as well as 
endophenotypes of AD including cognitive decline, brain amyloid burden, and 
brain volume.
RESULTS: We identified four risk proteins that were significantly associated 
with increased odds (peptidase inhibitor 3 (PI3), trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), 
pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPPA), agouti-related peptide (AGRP)) 
and two protective proteins (myostatin (MSTN), integrin aVb5 (ITGAV/ITGB5)) with 
decreased odds of baseline cognitive impairment or dementia. Of these, four 
proteins (MSTN, PI3, TFF3, PAPPA) were associated cognitive decline in subjects 
that were cognitively normal at baseline. ITGAV/ITGB5 was associated with lower 
brain amyloid burden, MSTN and ITGAV/ITGB5 were associated with larger brain 
volume and slower brain atrophy, and PI3, PAPPA, and AGRP were associated with 
smaller brain volume and/or faster brain atrophy.
DISCUSSION: These proteins may be useful as non-invasive biomarkers of dementia 
and cognitive impairment.
