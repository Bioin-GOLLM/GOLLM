The Schizosaccharomyces pombe sirtuin Hst4, functions in the maintenance of 
genome stability by regulating histone H3 lysine56 acetylation (H3K56ac) and 
promoting cell survival during replicative stress. However, its molecular 
function in DNA damage survival is unclear. Here, we show that hst4 deficiency 
in the fission yeast causes S phase delay and DNA synthesis defects. We 
identified a novel functional link between hst4 and the replisome component mcl1 
in a suppressor screen aimed to identify genes that could restore the slow 
growth and Methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) sensitivity phenotypes of the hst4Δ 
mutant. Expression of the replisome component Mcl1 rescues hst4Δ phenotypes. 
Interestingly, hst4 and mcl1 show an epistatic interaction and suppression of 
hst4Δ phenotypes by mcl1 is H3K56 acetylation dependent. Furthermore, Hst4 was 
found to regulate the expression of mcl1. Finally, we show that hSIRT2 depletion 
results in decreased levels of And-1 (human orthologue of Mcl1), establishing 
the conservation of this mechanism. Moreover, on induction of replication stress 
(MMS treatment), Mcl1 levels decrease upon Hst4 down regulation. Our results 
identify a novel function of Hst4 in regulation of DNA replication that is 
dependent on H3K56 acetylation. Both SIRT2 and And-1 are deregulated in cancers. 
Therefore, these findings could be of therapeutic importance in future.
