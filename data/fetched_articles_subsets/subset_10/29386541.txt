Tuberculosis (TB) affects a wide range of host species worldwide. Understanding 
host-pathogen co-evolution remains a global challenge owing to complex 
interactions among host genetic factors, pathogen traits and environmental 
conditions. We used an endemic wild boar population that had undergone a huge 
increase in Mycobacterium bovis infection prevalence, from 45% in 2002/06 to 83% 
in 2009/12, to understand the effects of host genetics on host TB outcomes and 
disease dynamics. Host genomic variation was characterized using a high-density 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, while host TB phenotype was assessed 
using both gross pathology and mycobacterial culture. Two complementary 
genome-wide association (GWAS) analyses were conducted: (i) infected-uninfected; 
and (ii) 2002/06-2009/12. The SNPs with the highest allelic frequency 
differences between time-periods and TB outcomes were identified and validated 
in a large dataset. In addition, we quantified the expression levels of some of 
their closest genes. These analyses highlighted various SNPs (i.e. rs81465339, 
rs81394585, rs81423166) and some of the closest genes (i.e. LOC102164072, 
BDNF/NT-3, NTRK2, CDH8, IGSF21) as candidates for host genetic susceptibility. 
In addition to TB-driven selection, our findings outline the putative role of 
demographic events in shaping genomic variation in natural populations and how 
population crashes and drift may impact host genetic susceptibility to TB over 
time.
