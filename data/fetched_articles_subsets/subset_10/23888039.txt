The essential bacterial protein FtsZ is a guanosine triphosphatase that 
self-assembles into a structure at the division site termed the "Z ring". During 
cytokinesis, the Z ring exerts a constrictive force on the membrane by using the 
chemical energy of guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis. However, the structural 
basis of this constriction remains unresolved. Here, we present the crystal 
structure of a guanosine diphosphate-bound Mycobacterium tuberculosis FtsZ 
protofilament, which exhibits a curved conformational state. The structure 
reveals a longitudinal interface that is important for function. The 
protofilament curvature highlights a hydrolysis-dependent conformational switch 
at the T3 loop that leads to longitudinal bending between subunits, which could 
generate sufficient force to drive cytokinesis.
