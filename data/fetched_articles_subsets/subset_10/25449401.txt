Several studies have shown that human carriers of the single nucleotide 
polymorphism of the μ-opioid receptor, OPRM1 A118G, exhibit greater drug and 
alcohol use, increased sensitivity to pain, and reduced sensitivity to the 
antinociceptive effects of opiates. In the present study, we employed a 
'humanized' mouse model containing the wild-type (118AA) or variant (118GG) 
allele to examine behavior in our model of drug-induced suppression of a natural 
reward cue and to compare the morphine pharmacological profile in acutely 
isolated sensory neurons. Compared with 118AA mice, our results demonstrate that 
homozygous 118GG mice exhibit greater avoidance of the cocaine-paired saccharin 
cue, a behavior linked to an aversive withdrawal-like state. 
Electrophysiological recordings confirmed the reduced modulation of Ca(2+) 
channels by morphine in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons from 118GG mice 
compared to the 118AA control cells. However, repeated cocaine exposure in 118GG 
mice led to a leftward shift of the morphine concentration-response relationship 
when compared with 118GG control mice, while a rightward shift was observed in 
118AA mice. These results suggest that cocaine exposure of mice carrying the 
118G allele leads to a heightened sensitivity of the reward system and a blunted 
modulation of Ca(2+) channels by morphine in sensory neurons.
