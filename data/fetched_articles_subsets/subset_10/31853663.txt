BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding the functional role of microRNA-410 
(miR-410) in osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH); hence, the aim of the 
present study was to investigate miR-410 targeting Wnt-11 to modulate the 
osteogenic and osteoclastic mechanism in the prevention of ONFH.
METHODS: Fifteen ONFH samples and 15 normal samples were gathered. The 
pathological changes of the femoral head, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts in the 
clinical samples were observed. The rat model of ONFH was injected with 
agomir-miR-410, Wnt-11-siRNA, or oe-Wnt-11. MiR-410; Wnt-11; osteoblast-related 
factors alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein (BGLAP), 
and Collα1 expression; and osteoclast-related factors acid phosphatase 5 (ACP5), 
cathepsin K (CTSK), and MMP9, as well as Bcl-2 and Bax expression, were tested 
by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. The osteogenic function index ALP and OCN 
together with osteoclast function index NTX-1 and CTX-1 in serum was tested by 
ELISA.
RESULTS: MiR-410, ALP, BGLAP, and Collα1 degraded as well as Wnt-11, ACP5, CTSK, 
and MMP9 enhanced in ONFH tissues of the clinical samples. Upregulated miR-410 
and downregulated Wnt-11 enhanced bone mineral density (BMD) and BV/TV of rats, 
heightened the BMD level of the femoral shaft, femoral head, and spinal column, 
and also raised the serum calcium and phosphorus levels of rats, while 
restrained apoptosis of osteocytes, elevated OCN, ALP, BGLAP, and Collα1 
expression and declined ACP5, CTSK, NTX-1, CTX-1, and MMP9 expression in rats.
CONCLUSION: This study suggested that upregulating miR-410 or downregulating 
Wnt-11 increases osteoblasts and reduces osteoclasts to alleviate the occurrence 
of ONFH. Thus, miR-410 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of 
ONFH.
