(Macro)-autophagy is a homeostatic process by which eukaryotic cells dispose of 
protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Autophagy is also used to degrade 
micro-organisms that invade intracellularly in a process termed xenophagy. 
Genome-wide association scans have recently identified autophagy genes as 
conferring susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD), one of the chronic 
inflammatory bowel diseases, with evidence suggesting that CD arises from a 
defective innate immune response to enteric bacteria. Here we review the 
emerging role of autophagy in CD, with particular focus on xenophagy and enteric 
E. coli strains with an adherent and invasive phenotype that have been 
consistently isolated from CD patients with ileal disease.
