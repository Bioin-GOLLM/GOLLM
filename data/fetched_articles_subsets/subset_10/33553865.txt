Extracting quantitative measurements from time-lapse images is necessary in 
external feedback control applications, where segmentation results are used to 
inform control algorithms. We describe ChipSeg, a computational tool that 
segments bacterial and mammalian cells cultured in microfluidic devices and 
imaged by time-lapse microscopy, which can be used also in the context of 
external feedback control. The method is based on thresholding and uses the same 
core functions for both cell types. It allows us to segment individual cells in 
high cell density microfluidic devices, to quantify fluorescent protein 
expression over a time-lapse experiment, and to track individual mammalian 
cells. ChipSeg enables robust segmentation in external feedback control 
experiments and can be easily customized for other experimental settings and 
research aims.
