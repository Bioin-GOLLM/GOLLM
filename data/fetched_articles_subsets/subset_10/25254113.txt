Keratoconus is a progressive thinning and anterior protrusion of the cornea that 
results in steepening and distortion of the cornea, altered refractive powers, 
and reduced vision. Keratoconus has a complex multifactorial etiology, with 
environmental, behavioral, and multiple genetic components contributing to the 
disease pathophysiology. Using genome-wide and candidate gene approaches several 
genomic loci and genes have been identified that highlight the complex molecular 
etiology of this disease. The review focuses on current knowledge of these 
genetic risk factors associated with keratoconus.
