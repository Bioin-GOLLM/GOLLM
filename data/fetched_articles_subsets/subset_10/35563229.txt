Biliary atresia is a severe obliterative cholangiopathy in early infancy that is 
by far the most common cause of surgical jaundice and the most common indicator 
for liver transplantation in children. With the advanced knowledge gained from 
different clinical trials and the development of research models, a more precise 
clinical classification of BA (i.e., isolated BA (IBA), cystic BA (CBA), 
syndromic BA (SBA), and cytomegalovirus-associated BA (CMVBA)) is proposed. 
Different BA subtypes have similar yet distinguishable clinical manifestations. 
The clinical and etiological heterogeneity leads to dramatically different 
prognoses; hence, treatment needs to be specific. In this study, we reviewed the 
clinical characteristics of different BA subtypes and revealed the molecular 
mechanisms of their developmental contributors. We aimed to highlight the 
differences among these various subtypes of BA which ultimately contribute to 
the development of a specific management protocol for each subtype.
