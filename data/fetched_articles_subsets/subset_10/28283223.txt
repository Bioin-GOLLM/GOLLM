Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) play critical roles in pathogen-induced 
innate immune responses and the subsequent induction of adaptive immune 
response. Dysregulation of IRF signaling is therefore thought to contribute to 
autoimmune disease pathogenesis. Indeed, numerous murine in vivo studies have 
documented protection from or enhanced susceptibility to particular autoimmune 
diseases in Irf-deficient mice. What has been lacking, however, is replication 
of these in vivo observations in primary immune cells from patients with 
autoimmune disease. These types of studies are essential as the majority of in 
vivo data support a protective role for IRFs in Irf-deficient mice, yet IRFs are 
often found to be overexpressed in patient immune cells. A significant body of 
work is beginning to emerge from both of these areas of study - mouse and human.
