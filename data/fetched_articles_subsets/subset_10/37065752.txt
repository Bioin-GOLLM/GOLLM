INTRODUCTION: Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a variant of primary 
hyperparathyroidism with consistently normal albumin-adjusted or free-ionized 
calcium levels. It may be an early stage of classic primary hyperparathyroidism 
or could represent primary kidney or bone disorder characterized by permanent 
elevation of PTH level.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aims to compare the FGF-23 levels in patients with 
PHPT, NPHPT, and normal calcium and PTH levels.
METHODS: Our study included patients who were referred to the endocrinology 
clinic with a presumptive diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism, an isolated 
increased level of PTH, or reduced bone densitometry. For each patient, we 
performed blood analysis of FGF-23, calcium, phosphate, vitamin D [25(OH)D3], 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), bone turnover markers, and urine 
analysis for calcium/creatinine ratio.
RESULTS: Our study included 105 patients. Thirty patients with hypercalcemic 
hyperparathyroidism (HPHPT group), thirty patients with elevated PTH and normal 
calcium levels (NPHPT group), and 45 patients with normal calcium and PTH levels 
in the control group. FGF 23 level was 59.5± 23 pg/ml in the NPHPT group, 77 ± 
33 pg/ml in the HPHPT group, and 49.7 ± 21.7 pg/ml in the control group 
(p=0.012). The phosphate level was lowest in the HPHPT group: 2.9 ± 0.6 vs 3.5 ± 
0.44 in the NPHPT and 3.8 ± 0.5 in the control groups (p=0.001). No differences 
were found in eGFR, 25(OH)D3, C-terminal telopeptide type I collagen (CTX) and 
procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) levels, and bone densitometry 
scores between the three study groups.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that NPHPT is an early stage of PHPT. Further 
studies are needed to determine the role of FGF-23 and its usefulness in NPHPT.
