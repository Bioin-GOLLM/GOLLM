Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a clinically and 
genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by 
the abnormal accumulation of brain iron and the progressive degeneration of the 
nervous system. One of the recently identified subtypes of NBIA is β-propeller 
protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN). BPAN is caused by de novo mutations 
in the WDR45/WIPI4 (WD repeat domain 45) gene. WDR45 is one of the four 
mammalian homologs of yeast Atg18, a regulator of autophagy. WDR45 deficiency in 
BPAN patients and animal models may result in defects in autophagic flux. 
However, how WDR45 deficiency leads to brain iron overload remains unclear. To 
elucidate the role of WDR45, we generated a WDR45-knockout (KO) SH-SY5Y 
neuroblastoma cell line using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing. Using these 
cells, we demonstrated that the non-TF (transferrin)-bound iron pathway 
dominantly mediated the accumulation of iron. Moreover, the loss of WDR45 led to 
defects in ferritinophagy, a form of autophagy that degrades the iron storage 
protein ferritin. We showed that impaired ferritinophagy contributes to iron 
accumulation in WDR45-KO cells. Iron accumulation was also detected in the 
mitochondria, which was accompanied by impaired mitochondrial respiration, 
elevated reactive oxygen species, and increased cell death. Thus, our study 
links WDR45 to specific iron acquisition pathways and ferritinophagy. Cover
