CONTEXT: Germline mutations in fumarate hydratase (FH) gene are known to cause 
hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) and are occasionally 
accompanied with cutaneous and uterine leiomyoma or cortisol-producing 
adrenocortical hyperplasia. However, the association between FH mutations and 
cardiac or adrenocortical tumors has remained unknown. Here, we identified a 
novel deletion in FH, exhibiting cardiac myxoma and subclinical Cushing syndrome 
due to adrenocortical tumor.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 44-year-old man was referred to our hospital for cardiac and 
adrenal tumor evaluation. He had a history of multiple painful, dermal papules 
and nodules diagnosed as cutaneous leiomyoma. The surgically resected cardiac 
tumor was diagnosed as myxoma. The adrenal tumor was clinically diagnosed as 
subclinical Cushing syndrome. Laparoscopically resected adrenal tumor was 
pathologically diagnosed as adrenocortical adenoma harboring unique histological 
findings similar to primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD). 
DNA analysis revealed a germline deletion in FH c0.737delT (p. Phe225Leufs*31) 
and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in cardiac myxoma. As a functional analysis of 
FH in cardiac myxoma, low FH protein expression with elevated 2-succinocysteine 
(2SC), a marker of FH dysfunction, was immunohistochemically detected. However, 
in adrenocortical tumor, LOH of FH was not detected, and FH or 2SC expression 
was not altered.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of HLRCC complicated by cardiac myxoma. LOH 
of FH deletion and its dysfunction were identified in cardiac myxoma. The 
association between FH deletion and adrenocortical lesion, however, needs to be 
further clarified.
