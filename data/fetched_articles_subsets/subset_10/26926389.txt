Lymphangiogensis is involved in various pathological conditions, such as 
arthritis and cancer metastasis. Although many factors have been identified to 
stimulate lymphatic vessel growth, little is known about lymphangiogenesis 
inhibitors. Here we report that membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase 
(MT1-MMP) is an endogenous suppressor of lymphatic vessel growth. 
MT1-MMP-deficient mice exhibit spontaneous corneal lymphangiogenesis without 
concomitant changes in angiogenesis. Mice lacking MT1-MMP in either lymphatic 
endothelial cells or macrophages recapitulate corneal lymphangiogenic phenotypes 
observed in Mmp14(-/-) mice, suggesting that the spontaneous lymphangiogenesis 
is both lymphatic endothelial cells autonomous and macrophage associated. 
Mechanistically, MT1-MMP directly cleaves LYVE-1 on lymphatic endothelial cells 
to inhibit LYVE-1-mediated lymphangiogenic responses. In addition, 
MT1-MMP-mediated PI3Kδ signalling restrains the production of VEGF-C from 
prolymphangiogenic macrophages through repressing the activation of NF-κB 
signalling. Thus, we identify MT1-MMP as an endogenous inhibitor of 
physiological lymphangiogenesis.
