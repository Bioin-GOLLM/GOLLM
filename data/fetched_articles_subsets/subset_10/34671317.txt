PURPOSE: Controversial results existed in amounts of studies investigating the 
authentic association of estrogen receptor genes (ESR1 and ESR2) polymorphisms 
with the occurrence and progression of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The 
inconsistency might result from different loci, sample sizes, and ethnicities. 
To find the potential correlations between ESR1/ESR2 polymorphisms and PCOS 
risk, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to 
comprehensively summarize current studies in a large combined population.
METHODS: Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane 
Library, CBM, CNKI, WANFANG, and VIP up to February 28, 2021. The quality of 
studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) scoring system. Odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated to synthesize 
data in five genetic models. Subgroup analyses were conducted by ethnicity. 
Heterogeneity and publication bias were also assessed. The protocol was 
registered in PROSPERO under the number CRD42021239200.
RESULTS: A total of 8 studies involving 1,522 PCOS patients and 4,198 controls 
were included. No evidence demonstrated the association of ESR1 rs2234693 
(OR=1.07 95%CI 0.98-1.18), ESR1 rs9340799 (OR=0.99 95%CI 0.69-1.43), or ESR2 
rs4986938 (OR=1.06 95%CI 0.81-1.38) polymorphisms and PCOS risk in five genetic 
models. According to stratified subgroup analyses, ethnicity was considered the 
major source of heterogeneity. No publication bias was found in eligible 
studies.
CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis found no significant associations between 
the variants of ESR1 rs2234693, ESR1 rs9340799, ESR2 rs4936938, and individual 
PCOS susceptibility, even if ethnicity was taken into account.
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: The protocol was registered in PROSPERO 
(available from https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO) with the ID number 
CRD42021239200.
