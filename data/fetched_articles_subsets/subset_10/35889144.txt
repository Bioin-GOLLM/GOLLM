This study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the occurrence and 
characteristics of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)- and 
carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales in Cape Verde. A total of 98 inpatients 
hospitalized at Hospital Universitário Agostinho Neto were screened for rectal 
colonization. All ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing isolates were tested for 
antimicrobial susceptibility and characterized by multilocus sequence typing. 
Mating-out assay followed by PCR-based replicon typing were performed to 
characterize the plasmids harboring carbapenemase encoding genes. A large 
proportion of patients carried ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales 
(56% and 6%, respectively). Among 93 ESBL-producing isolates, there were mainly 
Klebsiella pneumoniae (58%) and Escherichia coli (37%). Five different ESBLs 
were detected, with CTX-M-15 being highly predominant (92%). Six 
carbapenemase-producing isolates (five E. coli and one K. pneumoniae) were 
recovered, and all of the OXA-48-like type (four OXA-181, one OXA-48, and one 
OXA-244). The blaOXA-48 gene was located on an IncFI-type plasmid, the 
blaOXA-181 gene on IncFI or IncX3 plasmids, and the blaOXA-244 gene was found to 
be chromosomally located. The five carbapenemase-producing E. coli isolates 
belonged to five distinct sequence types. This study overall showed a very high 
prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, as well as the emergence of 
carbapenemase producers in this hospital.
