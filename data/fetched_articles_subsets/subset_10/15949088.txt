Sigmoid sinus thrombosis (SST) usually follows acute as well as chronic otitis 
media with coalescent mastoiditis. A singular case of noncoalescent mastoiditis 
complicated with thrombosis of deep cerebral sinuses occurring in a young child 
is presented. A genetic thrombophilic disorder (prothrombin G20210A allele 
mutation) was identified as the predisposing factor for this unusual 
complication. Particular emphasis is placed on the course of the disease, which 
showed regression only after surgical exploration and additional anticoagulant 
therapy. We conclude that a thorough and early assessment of coagulation factors 
should always be performed, especially in the population at risk, in order to 
rule out unusual aetiologies of these rare but still life-threatening 
pathological processes.
