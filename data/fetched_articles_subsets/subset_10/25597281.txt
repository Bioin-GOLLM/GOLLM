Biomarkers based on germline DNA variations could have translational 
implications by identifying prognostic factors and sub-classifying patients to 
tailored, patient-specific treatment. To investigate the association between 
germline variations in interleukin (IL) genes and lung cancer outcomes, we 
genotyped 251 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 33 different IL genes 
in 651 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Analyses were performed to 
investigate overall survival, disease-free survival, and recurrence. Our 
analyses revealed 24 different IL SNPs significantly associated with one or more 
of the lung cancer outcomes of interest. The GG genotype of IL16:rs7170924 was 
significantly associated with disease-free survival (HR = 0.65; 95% CI 
0.50-0.83) and was the only SNP that produced a false discovery rate (FDR) of 
modest confidence that the association is unlikely to represent a false-positive 
result (FDR = 0.142). Classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were 
used to identify potential higher-order interactions. We restricted the CART 
analyses to the five SNPs that were significantly associated with multiple 
endpoints (IL1A:rs1800587, IL1B:rs1143634, IL8:s12506479, IL12A:rs662959, and 
IL13:rs1881457) and IL16:rs7170924 which had the lowest FDR. CART analyses did 
not yield a tree structure for overall survival; separate CART tree structures 
were identified for recurrence, based on three SNPs (IL13:rs1881457, 
IL1B:rs1143634, and IL12A:rs662959), and for disease-free survival, based on two 
SNPs (IL12A:rs662959 and IL16:rs7170924), which may suggest that these candidate 
IL SNPs have a specific impact on lung cancer progression and recurrence. These 
data suggest that germline variations in IL genes are associated with clinical 
outcomes in NSCLC patients.
