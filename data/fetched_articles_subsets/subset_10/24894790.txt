Acroangiodermatitis (AAD) (synonym, pseudo-Kaposi sarcoma) is a term that 
encompasses 2 different conditions: (1) AAD of Mali, which refers to skin 
lesions that mainly develop bilaterally on the lower extremities of patients 
with chronic venous insufficiency and is an extreme form of stasis dermatitis 
and (2) Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome, which consists of an arteriovenous 
malformation that mainly affects the limbs of young patients unilaterally. We 
present a case of a 68-year-old lady with progressive skin lesions on both lower 
limbs (right > left) as a result of chronic venous insufficiency that became 
worse after the leg-vein harvest for coronary artery bypass grafting was taken 
from the right leg. Up to our knowledge this is the first case of its kind to be 
reported.
