OBJECTIVE: To explore the spatial-temporal interaction effect within a Bayesian 
framework and to probe the ecological influential factors for tuberculosis.
METHODS: Six different statistical models containing parameters of time, space, 
spatial-temporal interaction and their combination were constructed based on a 
Bayesian framework. The optimum model was selected according to the deviance 
information criterion (DIC) value. Coefficients of climate variables were then 
estimated using the best fitting model.
RESULTS: The model containing spatial-temporal interaction parameter was the 
best fitting one, with the smallest DIC value (-4,508,660). Ecological analysis 
results showed the relative risks (RRs) of average temperature, rainfall, wind 
speed, humidity, and air pressure were 1.00324 (95% CI, 1.00150-1.00550), 
1.01010 (95% CI, 1.01007-1.01013), 0.83518 (95% CI, 0.93732-0.96138), 0.97496 
(95% CI, 0.97181-1.01386), and 1.01007 (95% CI, 1.01003-1.01011), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The spatial-temporal interaction was statistically meaningful and 
the prevalence of tuberculosis was influenced by the time and space interaction 
effect. Average temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and air pressure influenced 
tuberculosis. Average humidity had no influence on tuberculosis.
