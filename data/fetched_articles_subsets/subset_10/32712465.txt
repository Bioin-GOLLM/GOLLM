Phosphorylation sites often have key regulatory functions and are central to 
many cellular signaling pathways, so mutations that modify them have the 
potential to contribute to pathological states such as cancer. Although many 
classifiers exist for prioritization of coding genomic variants, to our 
knowledge none of them explicitly account for the alteration or creation of 
kinase recognition motifs that alter protein structure, function, regulation of 
activity, and interaction networks through modifying the pattern of 
phosphorylation. We present a novel computational pipeline that uses a random 
forest classifier to predict the pathogenicity of a variant, according to its 
direct or indirect effect on local phosphorylation sites and the predicted 
functional impact of perturbing a phosphorylation event. We call this classifier 
PhosphoEffect and find that it compares favorably and with increased accuracy to 
the existing classifier PolyPhen 2.2.2 when tested on a dataset of known 
variants enriched for phosphorylation sites and their neighbors.
