OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between Paraoxonase1 (PON1) gene 
L55M polymorphism and coronary heart diseases (CHD) complicated with fasting 
hyperglycemia (FHG) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: Two hundreds and eighty four patients were recruited in this study, 
which comprised 86 patients with CHD, 62 with CHD and FHG, 46 with CHD and T2DM, 
and 90 patients without the above conditions. The sequences of the PON1 gene 
L55M polymorphism were analysed by the SNPs methods.
RESULTS: The frequency of allele L was 0.86. No significant differences in the 
frequencies of the three genotypes (LL, LM, and MM) were found among the four 
groups of patients. The L allele of PON1 L55M was not associated with the number 
and range of coronary arterial lesions (chi2 = 0.56, P = 0.76; chi2 = 0.11, P = 
0.74, respectively).
CONCLUSION: PON1 gene L55M polymorphism exists in Han populations in Guangdong, 
with LL as the main genotype. PON1 L55M gene polymorphism and allelic genes are 
not associated with the level of fasting blood glucose or diabetes mellitus. 
There is no evidence to support the relationship between PON1 L55M gene 
polymorphism and coronary artery lesions.
