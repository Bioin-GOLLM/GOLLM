Asymmetric division of adult stem cells generates one self-renewing stem cell 
and one differentiating cell, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis. A decline 
in stem cell function has been proposed to contribute to tissue ageing, although 
the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that changes in the 
stem cell orientation with respect to the niche during ageing contribute to the 
decline in spermatogenesis in the male germ line of Drosophila. Throughout the 
cell cycle, centrosomes in germline stem cells (GSCs) are oriented within their 
niche and this ensures asymmetric division. We found that GSCs containing 
misoriented centrosomes accumulate with age and that these GSCs are arrested or 
delayed in the cell cycle. The cell cycle arrest is transient, and GSCs appear 
to re-enter the cell cycle on correction of centrosome orientation. On the basis 
of these findings, we propose that cell cycle arrest associated with centrosome 
misorientation functions as a mechanism to ensure asymmetric stem cell division, 
and that the inability of stem cells to maintain correct orientation during 
ageing contributes to the decline in spermatogenesis. We also show that some of 
the misoriented GSCs probably originate from dedifferentiation of spermatogonia.
