Rhodopsins are photochemically reactive membrane proteins that covalently bind 
retinal chromophores. Type I rhodopsins are found in both prokaryotes and 
eukaryotic microbes, whereas type II rhodopsins function as photoactivated 
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in animal vision. Both rhodopsin families 
share the seven transmembrane α-helix GPCR fold and a Schiff base linkage from a 
conserved lysine to retinal in helix G. Nevertheless, rhodopsins are widely 
cited as a striking example of evolutionary convergence, largely because the two 
families lack detectable sequence similarity and differ in many structural and 
mechanistic details. Convergence entails that the shared rhodopsin fold is so 
especially suited to photosensitive function that proteins from separate origins 
were selected for this architecture twice. Here we show, however, that the 
rhodopsin fold is not required for photosensitive activity. We engineered 
functional bacteriorhodopsin variants with novel folds, including radical 
noncircular permutations of the α-helices, circular permutations of an 
eight-helix construct, and retinal linkages relocated to other helices. These 
results contradict a key prediction of convergence and thereby provide an 
experimental attack on one of the most intractable problems in molecular 
evolution: how to establish structural homology for proteins devoid of 
discernible sequence similarity.
