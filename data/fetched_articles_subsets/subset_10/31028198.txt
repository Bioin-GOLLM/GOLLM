BACKGROUND/AIM: Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) is responsible for the 
transformation of high density lipoprotein (HDL) to low density lipoprotein 
(LDL) and is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Our study investigated the 
association of the rs5883 CETP gene polymorphism with HDL and LDL levels, in 45 
coronary artery disease patients and 45 control patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CETP gene polymorphism was detected using Real 
Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Lipoprotein levels were measured using 
Quantimetrix system.
RESULTS: There were lack of associaition regarding CETP polymorphism in 
atherosclerosis and HDL and LDL levels (p>0.05) BMI was higher among coronary 
artery disease patients (CADP) compared to the control group (28.97±6.38, 
26.52±4.39 respectively, p<0.03). Frequency of CADP (82.6 %, n=19) who were 
taking treatment was higher (17.4 %, n=4) (p<0.00). The frequencies of 
hypertension and type-2 diabetes were higher among CADP (p<0.00). Families of 
CADP have more CADP (p<0.02). Small HDL particle levels were higher in the 
control group (p<0.00).
CONCLUSION: In Turkey, BMI, and frequencies of hypertension and type-2 diabetes 
were higher among CADP than among healthy controls. Furthermore, the genotypes 
of the rs5883 CETP gene polymorphism did not differ between CADP and healthy 
controls.
