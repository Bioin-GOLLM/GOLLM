To date, there is limited information about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen 
especially in the acute phase of the infection. While available data from cohort 
studies including a total of 342 patients in the acute or recovery phase of the 
infection are reassuring, one study mentioned detecting virus in the semen of 
6/38 COVID-19 patients. Here we assessed SARS-CoV-2 presence in the semen of 
COVID-19 positive patients in the acute stage of infection, within 24 hours of 
the positive nasopharyngeal swabs. Semen, seminal plasma and spermatozoa pellet 
were screened for SARS-CoV-2 and manual or airborne contamination during semen 
sampling. Among the 32 COVID-19 volunteers, the median interval from the onset 
of symptoms to semen collection was 4 days [IQR: 0-8]. Only one presented 
positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in semen and seminal plasma fractions, although the 
spermatozoa pellet was negative. Viral cultures were all negative. We observed 
slightly higher concentrations of bacterial DNA in the SARS-CoV-2 positive 
specimen than in all negative samples. The bacteria identified neither confirm 
nor rule out contamination by oropharyngeal secretions during collection. 
SARS-CoV-2 was rarely present in semen during the acute phase of the disease. 
This very rare situation could be connected to oral or manual contamination 
during semen collection. The possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen calls for 
nasopharyngeal viral testing and strict hygiene protocols during semen 
collection before assisted reproductive attempts.
