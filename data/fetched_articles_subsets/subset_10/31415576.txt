BACKGROUND: Based on the association of common GLIS3 variants with various forms 
of diabetes and the biological role of GLIS3 in beta-cells, we sequenced GLIS3 
in non-diabetic and diabetic Danes to investigate the effect of rare missense 
variants on glucose metabolism.
METHODS: We sequenced 53 patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young 
(MODY), 5,726 non-diabetic participants, 2,930 patients with newly diagnosed 
type 2 diabetes and 206 patients with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody 
(GADA) -positive diabetes.
RESULTS: In total we identified 86 rare (minor allele frequency < 0.1%) missense 
variants. None was considered causal for the presence of MODY. Among patients 
with type 2 diabetes, we observed a higher prevalence of rare GLIS3 missense 
variants (2.5%) compared to non-diabetic individuals (1.8%) (odds ratio of 1.37 
(interquartile range:1.01-1.88, p = 0.04)). A significantly increased HbA1c was 
found among patients with type 2 diabetes and with GADA-positive diabetes 
carrying rare GLIS3 variants compared to non-carriers of rare GLIS3 variants 
with diabetes (p = 0.02 and p = 0.004, respectively). One variant (p.I28V) was 
found to have a minor allele frequency of only 0.03% among patients with type 2 
diabetes compared to 0.2% among non-diabetic individuals suggesting a protective 
function (odds ratio of 0.20 (interquartile range: 0.005-1.4, p = 0.1)), an 
effect which was supported by publically available data. This variant was also 
associated with a lower level of fasting plasma glucose among non-diabetic 
individuals (p = 0.046).
CONCLUSION: Rare missense variants in GLIS3 associates nominally with increased 
level of HbA1c and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In contrast, 
the rare p.I28V variant associate with reduced level of fasting plasma glucose 
and may be protective against type 2 diabetes.
