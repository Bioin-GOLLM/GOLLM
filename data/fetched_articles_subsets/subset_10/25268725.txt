Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), one of the most important coenzymes in 
the cells, is a substrate of the signaling enzyme CD38, by which NAD is 
converted to a second messenger, cyclic ADP-ribose, which releases calcium from 
intracellular calcium stores. Starting with 
2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroarabinosyl-β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (ara-F NAD), a 
series of NAD analogues were synthesized and their activities to inhibit CD38 
NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) were evaluated. The adenosine-modified analogues 
showed potent inhibitory activities, among which 
2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroarabinosyl-β-nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (ara-F NGD) was 
the most effective one. The structure-activity relationship of NAD analogues was 
also discussed.
