BACKGROUND: Megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) is a rare overgrowth 
syndrome caused by postzygotic activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene.
AIM: To illustrate the benefits of gingival biopsy in the genetic diagnosis of 
overgrowth syndromes.
DESIGN: Gingival biopsy was performed on a 13-year-old patient and a 16-year-old 
patient with MCAP and who suffered from periodontal disease. PIK3CA sequencing 
was performed on DNA extracted from gingival biopsies, blood, and saliva.
RESULTS: Pathogenic p.Glu365Lys and p.Glu545Asp PIK3CA mutations were found in 
the gingival biopsies with an allelic frequency of 22% and 35%, respectively, 
while they were undetectable in blood or saliva. The genetic diagnosis of MCAP 
through detection of PIK3CA somatic mosaicism in a periodontal biopsy is 
unprecedented.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the tissue distribution and level of somatic mosaicism 
for PIK3CA mutation, the composite embryologic origin of periodontium and its 
high fibroblast cell content make it an ideal target for molecular analysis in 
overgrowth syndromes, and multidisciplinary approach including paediatric 
dentists should be encouraged. In addition, our clinical findings suggest that 
periodontal disease is part of the MCAP phenotypic spectrum and should be 
systematically investigated.
