BACKGROUND: Of the Rh blood type, Del is a rare variant that elicits the weakest 
anti-D reactivity. In this study, we revisit the genetic changes of Del allele 
and characterise the RHD splicing transcripts to realise the molecular basis of 
Del formation in the Taiwanese population.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The RHD exons from Del and D-positive individuals were 
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using different primer pairs 
followed by sequencing analyses. In addition, full-length RHD transcripts were 
reversed transcribed and amplified by nested-PCR. The type and frequency of the 
RHD splicing transcripts were analysed after sequencing the PCR products that 
were subcloned into a cloning vector.
RESULTS: All Del individuals had a characteristic 1227G>A mutation. No deletion 
of the exon sequences was found. At least nine types of RHD splicing transcripts 
including exons 7/8/9 deletion, 7/9 deletion, 8/9 deletion, 9 deletion, 2/3/7/9 
deletion, 2/3/7/8/9 deletion, exons 7/8/9 deletion with replacement of exon 3 
with RHCE exon 3, exon 9 deletion with cryptic insertion of 170 bp of intron 7 
and exons 7/8/9 deletion with cryptic insertion of 117 bp of intron 3 were 
identified in the Del -RBC. These aberrant splicing transcripts led to 
production of frame shift or truncated D antigen. Notably, no full-length RHD 
transcript was identified in the Del -RBC.
CONCLUSION: The RHD 1227G>A mutation contributes to the molecular basis of Del 
phenotype in the Taiwanese population. The point mutation results in aberrant 
frame shift or exon deletion transcripts and generates D protein with weak 
antigen presenting function.
