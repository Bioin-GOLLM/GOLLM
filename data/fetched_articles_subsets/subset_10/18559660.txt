OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological and family studies have demonstrated that 
susceptibility genes play an important role in the etiology of diabetic 
nephropathy, defined as persistent proteinuria or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
in type 1 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To efficiently search for genomic regions harboring 
diabetic nephropathy genes, we conducted a scan using 5,382 informative single 
nucleotide polymorphisms on 100 sibpairs concordant for type 1 diabetes but 
discordant for diabetic nephropathy. In addition to being powerful for detecting 
linkage to diabetic nephropathy, this design allows linkage analysis on type 1 
diabetes via traditional affected sibpair (ASP) analysis. In weighing the 
evidence for linkage, we considered maximum logarithm of odds score (maximum 
likelihood score [MLS]) values and corresponding allelic sharing patterns, 
calculated and viewed graphically using the software package SPLAT.
RESULTS: Our primary finding for diabetic nephropathy, broadly defined, is on 
chromosome 19q (MLS = 3.1), and a secondary peak exists on chromosome 2q (MLS = 
2.1). Stratification of discordant sibpairs based on whether disease had 
progressed to ESRD suggested four tertiary peaks on chromosome 1q (ESRD only), 
chromosome 20p (proteinuria only), and chromosome 3q (two loci 58 cm apart, one 
for ESRD only and another for proteinuria only). Additionally, analysis of 130 
ASPs for type 1 diabetes confirmed the linkage to the HLA region on chromosome 
6p (MLS = 9.2) and IDDM15 on chromosome 6q (MLS = 3.1).
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several novel loci as candidates for diabetic 
nephropathy, none of which appear to be the sole genetic determinant of diabetic 
nephropathy in type 1 diabetes. In addition, this study confirms two previously 
reported type 1 diabetes loci.
