Group A rotavirus (RVA) is a major cause of diarrhea in children worldwide. 
Although RVA infects many animals, little is known about RVA in bats. The 
present study investigated the genetic diversity of RVA in Zambian bats. We 
identified RVA from two straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and an 
Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), and analyzed the genome sequences of 
these strains. Genome segments of the RVA strains from Zambian E. helvum showed 
97%-99% nucleotide sequence identity with those of other RVA strains from E. 
helvum in Cameroon, which is 2800 km from the sampling locations. These findings 
suggest that migratory straw-colored fruit bat species, distributed across 
sub-Saharan Africa, have the potential to disseminate RVA across long distances. 
By contrast, the RVA strain from Zambian R. aegyptiacus carried highly divergent 
NSP2 and NSP4 genes, leading us to propose novel genotypes N21 and E27, 
respectively. Notably, this RVA strain also shared the same genotype for VP6 and 
NSP3 with the RVA strains from Zambian E. helvum, suggesting interspecies 
transmission and genetic reassortment may have occurred between these two bat 
species in the past. Our study has important implications for RVA dispersal in 
bat populations, and expands our knowledge of the ecology, diversity and 
evolutionary relationships of RVA.
