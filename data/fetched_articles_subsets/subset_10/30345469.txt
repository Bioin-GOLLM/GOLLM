BACKGROUND: Pyrimidine is an important pharmacophore in the field of medicinal 
chemistry and exhibit a broad spectrum of biological potentials. A study was 
carried out to identify the target protein of potent bis-pyrimidine derivatives 
using reverse docking program. PharmMapper, a robust online tool was used for 
identifying the target proteins based on reverse pharmacophore mapping. The 
murine macrophage (RAW 264.7) and human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cancer cell 
line used for selectivity and safety study.
METHODS: An open web server PharmMapper was used to identify the possible target 
of the developed compounds through reverse pharmacophore mapping. The results 
were analyzed and validated through docking with Schrodinger v9.6 using 10 
protein GTPase HRas selected as possible target. The docking studies with 
Schr√∂dinger validated the binding behavior of bis-pyrimidine compounds within 
GTP binding pocket. MTT and sulforhodamine assay were used as antiproliferative 
activity.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The protein was found one of the top scored targets of 
the compound 18, hence, the GTPase HRas protein was found crucial to be targeted 
for competing cancer. Toxicity study demonstrated the significant selectivity of 
most active compounds, 12, 16 and 18 showed negligible cell toxicity at their 
IC50 concentration.
CONCLUSION: From the results, we may conclude that GTPase HRas as a possible 
target of studied bis-pyrimidine derivatives where the retrieved information may 
be quite useful for rational drug designing.
