We performed genetic mapping studies of an 11-generation pedigree with an 
autosomal dominant, juvenile-onset motor-systems disease. The disorder is 
characterized by slow progression, distal limb amyotrophy, and pyramidal tract 
signs associated with severe loss of motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal 
cord. The gene for this disorder, classified as a form of juvenile amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), is designated "ALS4." We performed a genomewide search 
and detected strong evidence for linkage of the ALS4 locus to markers from 
chromosome 9q34. The highest LOD score (Z) was obtained with D9S1847 (Z=18.8, 
recombination fraction of .00). An analysis of recombinant events identified 
D9S1831 and D9S164 as flanking markers, on chromosome 9q34, that define an 
approximately 5-cM interval that harbors the ALS4 gene. These results extend the 
degree of heterogeneity within familial ALS syndromes, and they implicate a gene 
on chromosome 9q34 as critical for motor-neuron function.
