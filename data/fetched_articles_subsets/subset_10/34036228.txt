PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) show efficacy in treating patients with lung adenocarcinoma with 
EGFR-activating mutations. However, a significant subset of targeted patients 
fail to respond. Unlike acquired resistance (AR), intrinsic resistance (IR) 
remains poorly understood. We investigated whether epigenomic factors contribute 
to patient-to-patient heterogeneity in the EGFR-TKI response and aimed to 
characterize the IR subpopulation that obtains no benefit from EGFR-TKIs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of 79 
tumors sampled from patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma before they 
received EGFR-TKI treatment and analyzed the patient responses. Pyrosequencing 
was performed in a validation cohort of 163 patients with EGFR-activating 
mutations.
RESULTS: A DNA methylation landscape of 216 CpG sites with differential 
methylation was established to elucidate the association of DNA methylation with 
the characteristics and EGFR-TKI response status of the patients. Functional 
analysis of 37 transcription-repressive sites identified the enrichment of 
transcription factors, notably homeobox (HOX) genes. DNA methylation of HOXB9 
(cg13643585) in the enhancer region yielded 88% sensitivity for predicting drug 
response (odds ratio [OR], 6.64; 95% CI, 1.98 to 25.23; P = .0009). 
Pyrosequencing validated that HOXB9 gained methylation in patients with a poor 
EGFR-TKI response (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.13 to 8.19; P = .019).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that homeobox DNA methylation could be a novel 
tumor cellular state that can aid the precise categorization of tumor 
heterogeneity in the study of IR to EGFR-TKIs. We identified, for the first 
time, an epigenomic factor that can potentially complement DNA mutation status 
in discriminating patients with lung adenocarcinoma who are less likely to 
benefit from EGFR-TKI treatment, thereby leading to improved patient management 
in precision medicine.
