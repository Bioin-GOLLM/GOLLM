Identification of peptides mediating protein-protein interaction (PPI) is 
crucial for understanding the function of interlinked proteins in cellular 
processes and amino acid-associated diseases. Traditional PPI assays are 
laborious, involving the generation of many truncated proteins. SPOT peptide 
assay allows high-throughput detection of domains essential for PPI by 
synthesizing several hundred peptides on a cellulose membrane. Here, we present 
a rapid SPOT peptide protocol for identifying the binding motifs, which mediate 
interaction between the chromatin remodeling factors BAF155/BAF170 and the 
epigenetic factor Kdm6b. For complete details on the use and execution of this 
protocol, please refer to Narayanan et al. (2015).
