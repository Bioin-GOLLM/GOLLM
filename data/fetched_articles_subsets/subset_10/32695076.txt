In the course of optimizing GPI biosynthesis inhibitors, we designed and 
synthetized a 2-aminonicotinamide derivative named 11g. After evaluating the 
antifungal activity of compound 11g in vitro, we investigated the influences of 
11g on fungi immunogenicity. In addition, we also took advantage of murine 
systemic candidiasis model to investigate the protective effects of 11g in vivo. 
Results show that 11g exhibited potent antifungal activity both in vitro and in 
vivo. Further study shows that 11g caused the unmasking of fungi β-glucan layer, 
leading to stronger immune responses in macrophages through Dectin-1. These 
results suggest that 11g is a very promising antifungal candidate, which assists 
in eliciting stronger immune responses to help host immune system disposing 
pathogens. The discovery of 11g might expand the toolbox of fungal infection 
treatment.
