Since the discovery and structural characterization of metal organic polygons 
and polyhedra (MOPs), scientists have explored their potential in various 
applications like catalysis, separation, storage, and sensing. In recent years, 
scientists have explored the potential of supramolecular MOPs in biomedical 
application. Pioneering works by Ehrlich, Rosenberg, Lippard, Stang and others 
have demonstrated that MOPs have great potential as a novel class of 
metallo-therapeutics that can deliver cargoes (drugs and dyes) selectively. In 
this article, we document the progress made over the past two decades on the 
biomedical applications of MOPs and discuss the future prospects of this 
emerging field.
