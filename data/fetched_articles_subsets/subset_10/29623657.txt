A 10-year-old girl with persistent erythrocytosis and ruddy complexion was 
diagnosed with primary familial congenital polycythemia (PFCP) involving a novel 
heterozygous mutation of c.1220C>A, p.Ser407X in exon 8 of the erythropoietin 
receptor gene (EPOR). This mutation causes truncation of EPOR, resulting in loss 
of the cytoplasmic region, which is necessary for negative regulation of 
erythropoietin signal transmission. Genetic analysis showed that the mutated 
EPOR was inherited from her mother. Her mother had polycythemia and had 
undergone venesection several times when she was young, but her polycythemic 
state appeared to have resolved. Venesection was not needed to maintain Hct 
levels within normal range. For the case reported here, venesection was also 
conducted to maintain the blood Hct level below 50%. We observed that after the 
patient experienced menarche, the volume and frequency of venesection needed to 
maintain Hct level <â€‰50% were clearly reduced compared with those before 
menarche. These findings suggest that, in female patients with this type of EPOR 
mutation, menstruation might reduce blood volume in a manner similar to 
venesection. Spontaneous remission of erythrocytosis may thus occur after the 
start of menstrual bleeding.
