associated with visuospatial disability of schizophrenia.

Rs9722 and rs1051169 have been reported as affecting the levels of S100B in the 
serum or the brain, and haplotypes containing these two SNPs have been 
associated with schizophrenia. The current study investigated the role of the 
S100B gene in an endophenotype of schizophrenia-spatial disability. 304 
schizophrenia patients and 196 healthy controls were given a block design task 
and a mental rotation task. Results showed that the two aforementioned SNPs and 
related haplotypes were associated with the spatial disability of schizophrenia 
patients. Specifically, risk factors for the elevated S100B levels, including 
the A allele of rs9722, the G allele of rs1051169, and the AG haplotype, were 
associated with a poorer performance on both tests of spatial ability, 
especially the mental rotation task. These results implicate a role for S100B 
gene polymorphisms in the cognitive functions of schizophrenia patients and 
encourage further investigation into spatial disability as an endophenotype of 
schizophrenia.
