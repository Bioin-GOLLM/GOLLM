Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is controlled by intricate regulatory 
mechanisms to ensure that fixed nitrogen is readily assimilated into biomass and 
not released to the environment. Understanding the complex regulatory circuits 
that couple nitrogen fixation to ammonium assimilation is a prerequisite for 
engineering diazotrophic strains that can potentially supply fixed nitrogen to 
non-legume crops. In this review, we explore how the current knowledge of 
nitrogen metabolism and BNF regulation may allow strategies for genetic 
manipulation of diazotrophs for ammonia excretion and provide a contribution 
towards solving the nitrogen crisis.
