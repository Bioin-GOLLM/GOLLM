BACKGROUND: MDM2 is a negative regulator of p53 and is upregulated in numerous 
human cancers. While different MDM2 splice variants have been observed in both 
normal tissues and malignant cells, their functions are poorly understood.
METHODS: We evaluated the effect of MDM2 splice variants by overexpression in 
MCF-7 cells and analyses of expression of downstream genes (qPCR and Western 
blot), subcellular localization (immunofluorescence), cell cycle assays 
(Nucleocounter3000), apoptosis analysis (Annexin V detection), and induction of 
senescence (β-galactosidase analysis).
RESULTS: In a screen for MDM2 splice variants in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, 
extended with data from healthy leukocytes, we found P2-MDM2-10 and MDM2-Δ5 to 
be the splice variants expressed at highest levels. Contrasting MDM2 full-length 
protein, we found normal tissue expression levels of P2-MDM2-10 and MDM2-Δ5 to 
be highest in individuals harboring the promoter SNP309TT genotype. While we 
detected no protein product coded for by MDM2-Δ5, the P2-MDM2-10 variant 
generated a protein markedly more stable than MDM2-FL. Both splice variants were 
significantly upregulated in stressed cells (P=4.3 × 10-4 and P=7.1 × 10-4, 
respectively). Notably, chemotherapy treatment and overexpression of P2-MDM2-10 
or MDM2-Δ5 both lead to increased mRNA levels of the endogenous MDM2-FL (P=.039 
and P=.070, respectively) but also the proapoptotic gene PUMA (P=.010 and 
P=.033, respectively), accompanied by induction of apoptosis and repression of 
senescence.
CONCLUSION: We found P2-MDM2-10 and MDM2-Δ5 to have distinct biological 
functions in breast cancer cells.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Alternative splicing may influence the oncogenic effects 
of the MDM2 gene.
