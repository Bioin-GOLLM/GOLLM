Distal hereditary motor neuropathies (HMNs) and axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
neuropathy (CMT2) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases 
characterized primarily by motor neuron degeneration and distal weakness. The 
genetic cause for about half of the individuals affected by HMN/CMT2 remains 
unknown. Here, we report the identification of pathogenic variants in GBF1 
(Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1) in four 
unrelated families with individuals affected by sporadic or dominant HMN/CMT2. 
Genomic sequencing analyses in seven affected individuals uncovered four 
distinct heterozygous GBF1 variants, two of which occurred de novo. Other known 
HMN/CMT2-implicated genes were excluded. Affected individuals show HMN/CMT2 with 
slowly progressive distal muscle weakness and musculoskeletal deformities. 
Electrophysiological studies confirmed axonal damage with chronic neurogenic 
changes. Three individuals had additional distal sensory loss. GBF1 encodes a 
guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that facilitates the activation of members of 
the ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor) family of small GTPases. GBF1 is mainly 
involved in the formation of coatomer protein complex (COPI) vesicles, 
maintenance and function of the Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria migration and 
positioning. We demonstrate that GBF1 is present in mouse spinal cord and muscle 
tissues and is particularly abundant in neuropathologically relevant sites, such 
as the motor neuron and the growth cone. Consistent with the described role of 
GBF1 in Golgi function and maintenance, we observed marked increase in Golgi 
fragmentation in primary fibroblasts derived from all affected individuals in 
this study. Our results not only reinforce the existing link between Golgi 
fragmentation and neurodegeneration but also demonstrate that pathogenic 
variants in GBF1 are associated with HMN/CMT2.
