BACKGROUND: The Zimbabwean national prevention of mother-to-child HIV 
transmission (PMTCT) program provided primarily single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) 
from 2002-2009 and is currently replacing sdNVP with more effective 
antiretroviral (ARV) regimens.
METHODS: Published HIV and PMTCT models, with local trial and programmatic data, 
were used to simulate a cohort of HIV-infected, pregnant/breastfeeding women in 
Zimbabwe (mean age 24.0 years, mean CD4 451 cells/µL). We compared five PMTCT 
regimens at a fixed level of PMTCT medication uptake: 1) no antenatal ARVs 
(comparator); 2) sdNVP; 3) WHO 2010 guidelines using "Option A" (zidovudine 
during pregnancy/infant NVP during breastfeeding for women without advanced HIV 
disease; lifelong 3-drug antiretroviral therapy (ART) for women with advanced 
disease); 4) WHO "Option B" (ART during pregnancy/breastfeeding without advanced 
disease; lifelong ART with advanced disease); and 5) "Option B+:" lifelong ART 
for all pregnant/breastfeeding, HIV-infected women. Pediatric (4-6 week and 
18-month infection risk, 2-year survival) and maternal (2- and 5-year survival, 
life expectancy from delivery) outcomes were projected.
RESULTS: Eighteen-month pediatric infection risks ranged from 25.8% (no 
antenatal ARVs) to 10.9% (Options B/B+). Although maternal short-term outcomes 
(2- and 5-year survival) varied only slightly by regimen, maternal life 
expectancy was reduced after receipt of sdNVP (13.8 years) or Option B (13.9 
years) compared to no antenatal ARVs (14.0 years), Option A (14.0 years), or 
Option B+ (14.5 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Replacement of sdNVP with currently recommended regimens for PMTCT 
(WHO Options A, B, or B+) is necessary to reduce infant HIV infection risk in 
Zimbabwe. The planned transition to Option A may also improve both pediatric and 
maternal outcomes.
