GWAMAR: genome-wide assessment of mutations associated with drug resistance in 
bacteria.

Wozniak M, Tiuryn J, Wong L.

BACKGROUND: Development of drug resistance in bacteria causes antibiotic 
therapies to be less effective and more costly. Moreover, our understanding of 
the process remains incomplete. One promising approach to improve our 
understanding of how resistance is being acquired is to use whole-genome 
comparative approaches for detection of drug resistance-associated mutations.
RESULTS: We present GWAMAR, a tool we have developed for detecting of drug 
resistance-associated mutations in bacteria through comparative analysis of 
whole-genome sequences. The pipeline of GWAMAR comprises several steps. First, 
for a set of closely related bacterial genomes, it employs eCAMBer to identify 
homologous gene families. Second, based on multiple alignments of the gene 
families, it identifies mutations among the strains of interest. Third, it 
calculates several statistics to identify which mutations are the most 
associated with drug resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our analysis of two large datasets retrieved from publicly 
available data for M. tuberculosis, we identified a set of novel putative drug 
resistance-associated mutations. As a part of this work, we present also an 
application of our tool to detect putative compensatory mutations.
