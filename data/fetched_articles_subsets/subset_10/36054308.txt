The myeloproliferative neoplasms are associated with chronic kidney disease but 
whether clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is associated 
with impaired kidney function is unknown. In the Danish General Suburban 
Population Study (N = 19 958) from 2010 to 2013, 645 individuals were positive 
for JAK2V617F (N = 613) or CALR (N = 32) mutations. Mutation-positive 
individuals without haematological malignancy were defined as having CHIP 
(N = 629). We used multiple and inverse probability weighted (IPW)-adjusted 
linear regression analysis to estimate adjusted mean (95% confidence interval) 
differences in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; ml/min/1.73 m2 ) by 
mutation status, variant allele frequency (VAF%), blood cell counts, and 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). We performed 11-year longitudinal 
follow-up of eGFR in all individuals. Compared to CHIP-negative individuals, the 
mean differences in eGFR were -5.6 (-10.3, -0.8, p = .02) for CALR, -11.9 
(-21.4, -2.4, p = 0.01) for CALR type 2, and -10.1 (-18.1, -2.2, p = .01) for 
CALR with VAF ≥ 1%. The IPW-adjusted linear regression analyses showed similar 
results. NLR was negatively associated with eGFR. Individuals with CALR type 2 
had a worse 11-year longitudinal follow-up on eGFR compared to CHIP-negative 
individuals (p = .004). In conclusion, individuals with CALR mutations, 
especially CALR type 2, had impaired kidney function compared to CHIP-negative 
individuals as measured by a lower eGFR at baseline and during 11-year 
follow-up.
