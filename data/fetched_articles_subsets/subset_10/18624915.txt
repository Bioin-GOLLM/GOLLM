Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic, adult-onset neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by the selective loss of upper and lower motor neurons, 
resulting in severe atrophy of muscles and death. Although the exact pathogenic 
mechanism of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) causing familial ALS is still 
elusive, toxic protein aggregation leading to insufficiency of chaperones is one 
of the main hypotheses. In this study, we investigated the effect of 
over-expressing one of these chaperones, heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), in ALS. 
Mice over-expressing the human, mutant SOD1(G93A) were crossed with mice that 
ubiquitously over-expressed human Hsp27. Even though the single transgenic 
hHsp27 mice showed protection against spinal cord ischemia, the double 
transgenic SOD1(G93A)/hHsp27 mice did not live longer, and did not show a 
significant delay in the onset of disease compared to their SOD1(G93A) 
littermates. There was no protective effect of hHsp27 over-expression on the 
motor neurons and on the mutant SOD1 aggregates in the double transgenic 
SOD1(G93A)/hHsp27 mice. In conclusion, despite the protective action against 
acute motor neuron injury, Hsp27 alone is not sufficient to protect against the 
chronic motor neuron injury due to the presence of mutant SOD1.
