BACKGROUND: Memantine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
antagonist, has been approved for use in Alzheimer's disease, but an increasing 
number of studies have investigated its utility for neuropsychiatric disorders. 
Here, we characterized a novel compound, fluoroethylnormemtantine (FENM), which 
was derived from memantine with an extra Fluor in an optimized position for in 
vivo biomarker labeling. We sought to determine if FENM produced similar 
behavioral effects as memantine and/or if FENM has beneficial effects against 
fear, avoidance, and behavioral despair.
METHODS: We administered saline, FENM, or memantine prior to a number of 
behavioral assays, including paired-pulse inhibition, open field, light dark 
test, forced swim test, and cued fear conditioning in male Wistar rats.
RESULTS: Unlike memantine, FENM did not produce nonspecific side effects and did 
not alter sensorimotor gating or locomotion. FENM decreased immobility in the 
forced swim test. Moreover, FENM robustly facilitated fear extinction learning 
when administered prior to either cued fear conditioning training or tone 
reexposure.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that FENM is a promising, novel compound that 
robustly reduces fear behavior and may be useful for further preclinical 
testing.
