OBJECTIVE: To verify whether N363S polymorphism of the glucocorticoid 
receptor-gene can be associated to visceral fat by CT scan in obese individuals, 
and the impact of this variant on metabolic profile.
METHODS: The N363S variant was screened in 295 Brazilians, 195 were obese and 
100 presented normal weight. Based on genotype, obese N363S SNP carriers were 
paired with obese wild-type subjects. This group was submitted to a CT scan and 
metabolic profile assessment.
RESULTS: Ten subjects were found to be heterozygous for the variant (A/G 
genotype frequency 3.4%), 8 (4.1%) obese and 2 (2.0%) non-obese. No differences 
were reported for visceral adiposity area (145.8 +/- 49.9 vs.147.7 +/- 48.8 
cm(2); p = 0.92) based on CT scan results but N363S SNP carriers showed a 
proneness to unfavorable metabolic changes.
CONCLUSION: The N363S polymorphism prevalence is low in the Brazilian 
population, although its presence may contribute to the worsening of 
individuals' metabolic profiles.
