Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to dramatic impairments of motor, sensory, and 
autonomic functions of affected individuals. Following the primary injury, there 
is an increased release of glutamate that leads to excitotoxicity and further 
neuronal death. Therefore, modulating glutamate excitotoxicity seems to be a 
promising target to promote neuroprotection during the acute phase of the 
injury. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of a FDA approved 
antiepileptic drug (levetiracetam-LEV), known for binding to the synaptic 
vesicle protein SV2A in the brain and spinal cord. LEV therapy was tested in two 
models of SCI-one affecting the cervical and other the thoracic level of the 
spinal cord. The treatment was effective on both SCI models. Treated animals 
presented significant improvements on gross and fine motor functions. The 
histological assessment revealed a significant decrease of cavity size, as well 
as higher neuronal and oligodendrocyte survival on treated animals. Molecular 
analysis revealed that LEV acts by stabilizing the astrocytes allowing an 
effective uptake of the excess glutamate from the extracellular space. Overall, 
our results demonstrate that Levetiracetam may be a promising drug for acute 
management of SCI.
