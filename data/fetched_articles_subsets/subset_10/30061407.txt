The tumor suppressor p53 regulates multiple cellular functions, including energy 
metabolism. Metabolic deregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of some 
cancers and in metabolic disorders and may result from the inactivation of p53 
functions. Using RNA sequencing and ChIP sequencing of cancer cells and 
preadipocytes, we demonstrate that p53 modulates several metabolic processes via 
the transactivation of energy metabolism genes including 
dihydropyrimidinase-like 4 (DPYSL4). DPYSL4 is a member of the collapsin 
response mediator protein family, which is involved in cancer invasion and 
progression. Intriguingly, DPYSL4 overexpression in cancer cells and 
preadipocytes up-regulated ATP production and oxygen consumption, while DPYSL4 
knockdown using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 down-regulated energy production. 
Furthermore, DPYSL4 was associated with mitochondrial supercomplexes, and 
deletion of its dihydropyrimidinase-like domain abolished its association and 
its ability to stimulate ATP production and suppress the cancer cell invasion. 
Mouse-xenograft and lung-metastasis models indicated that DPYSL4 expression 
compromised tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Consistently, database analyses 
demonstrated that low DPYSL4 expression was significantly associated with poor 
survival of breast and ovarian cancers in accordance with its reduced expression 
in certain types of cancer tissues. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis using 
the adipose tissue of obese patients revealed that DPYSL4 expression was 
positively correlated with INFg and body mass index in accordance with p53 
activation. Together, these results suggest that DPYSL4 plays a key role in the 
tumor-suppressor function of p53 by regulating oxidative phosphorylation and the 
cellular energy supply via its association with mitochondrial supercomplexes, 
possibly linking to the pathophysiology of both cancer and obesity.
