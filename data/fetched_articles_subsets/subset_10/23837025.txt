Multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma (mPTC) comprises about 20-30% of PTC. In 
mPTC, individual tumor foci can be identical or frequently composed of different 
histological types including follicular, solid, tall-cell or conventional 
patterns. We report a case of mPTC consisting of one encapsulated follicular 
variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) and three conventional PTCs in a 
44-year-old woman. This case genetically demonstrates unique features including 
the simultaneous presence of the BRAF V600E (T1799A) mutation and the BRAF K601E 
(A1801G) mutation in conventional PTC and FVPTC, respectively.
