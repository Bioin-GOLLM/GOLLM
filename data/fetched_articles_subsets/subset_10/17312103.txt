IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)4 plays a central role in innate and adaptive 
immunity, and is a crucial component in IL-1/TLR signaling. We have determined 
the crystal structures of the apo and ligand-bound forms of human IRAK4 kinase 
domain. These structures reveal several features that provide opportunities for 
the design of selective IRAK4 inhibitors. The N-terminal lobe of the IRAK4 
kinase domain is structurally distinctive due to a loop insertion after an 
extended N-terminal helix. The gatekeeper residue is a tyrosine, a unique 
feature of the IRAK family. The IRAK4 structures also provide insights into the 
regulation of its activity. In the apo structure, two conformations coexist, 
differing in the relative orientation of the two kinase lobes and the position 
of helix C. In the presence of an ATP analog only one conformation is observed, 
indicating that this is the active conformation.
