OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of minority resistant variants (MRV) and 
X4-tropic minority variants in ART-naive HIV-2-infected patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: ART-naive HIV-2-infected patients with detectable plasma 
viral load (>100 copies/mL) included in the ANRS HIV-2 CO5 Cohort were assessed. 
We performed ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) of protease, RT, integrase and gp105 
regions. Only mutations in the HIV-2 ANRS list >1% were considered. HIV-2 
tropism was assessed by V3 loop region UDS, and each read was interpreted with 
determinants of CXCR4-coreceptor use.
RESULTS: Among the 47 patients assessed, three displayed plasma viruses with a 
resistance-associated mutation (RAM) above the 20% detection threshold, all in 
RT, resulting in a prevalence of transmitted drug resistance for NRTI of 7.9% 
(95% CI 0.0%-16.5%). No RAM above the 20% detection threshold was found in 
protease or integrase. At the 1% detection threshold the transmitted drug 
resistance prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI 0.6%-19.0%), 13.2% (95% CI 3.5%-22.9%) 
and 4.5% (95% CI 0%-17.5%) for PI, NRTI and integrase inhibitors. The most 
prevalent MRV was the PI RAM I50V detected in three samples. Tropism analysis 
showed that 21% of patients (4 of 19) exhibited X4-tropic viruses: two in 
majority proportion and two in minority proportions (1.5% and 1.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this first study assessing the prevalence of MRV in HIV-2 
infection among ART-naive patients, we observed a 2-3-fold higher prevalence of 
RAM when a 1% detection threshold of mutations was used compared with a 20% 
threshold. Similarly, the proportion of patients with X4-tropic viruses was 
twice as high when UDS was used.
