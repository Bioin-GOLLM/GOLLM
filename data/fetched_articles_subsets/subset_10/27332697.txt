The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzymes p300 and CBP are closely related 
paralogs that serve as transcriptional coactivators and have been found to be 
dysregulated in cancer and other diseases. p300/CBP is a multidomain protein and 
possesses a highly conserved bromodomain that has been shown to bind acetylated 
Lys residues in both proteins and various small molecules, including I-CBP112 
and CBP30. Here we show that the ligand I-CBP112 can stimulate nucleosome 
acetylation up to 3-fold while CBP30 does not. Activation of p300/CBP by 
I-CBP112 is not observed with the isolated histone H3 substrate but requires a 
nucleosome substrate. I-CBP112 does not impact nucleosome acetylation by the 
isolated p300 HAT domain, and the effects of I-CBP112 on p300/CBP can be 
neutralized by CBP30, suggesting that I-CBP112 likely allosterically activates 
p300/CBP through bromodomain interactions. Using mass spectrometry and Western 
blots, we have found that I-CBP112 particularly stimulates acetylation of Lys18 
of histone H3 (H3K18) in nucleosomes, an established in vivo site of p300/CBP. 
In addition, we show that I-CBP112 enhances H3K18 acetylation in acute leukemia 
and prostate cancer cells in a concentration range commensurate with its 
antiproliferative effects. Our findings extend the known pharmacology of 
bromodomain ligands in the regulation of p300/CBP and suggest a novel approach 
to modulating histone acetylation in cancer.
