BACKGROUND: Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is an auto-inflammatory 
bone disease that usually develops in childhood. Spinal involvement is a common 
manifestation of CNO, but it is rare for CNO to lead to rapid progression of 
scoliosis deformity. Here we present a 9-year-old girl with acute scoliosis with 
CNO and scoliosis progressed rapidly in 2 months.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-year-old girl presented bilateral shoulder inequality 
with pain in the left hypochondrium for 2 months. Standing spinal x-rays showed 
right convex scoliosis with a 25° Cobb angle. Chest magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) showed that the T8 vertebra was flattened and local bone was destroyed 
with bone marrow edema. The bone biopsy showed evidence of fibrosis and chronic 
inflammatory changes with no specific diagnosis. One month later, her scoliosis 
and bone destruction deteriorated obviously. Thoracic vertebra MRI showed that 
the T8 vertebra had a compression fracture. 99mTc-MDP whole-body bone 
scintigraphy showed intense uptake at T8/9 and the right sacroiliac joint. She 
was diagnosed with CNO accompanied by rapidly progressive scoliosis. The 
scoliosis was successfully treated with adalimumab and zoledronic acid, which 
showed significant improvement after 6 months of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Zoledronic acid and adalimumab successfully treated CNO with rapidly 
progressive scoliosis, but could not prevent vertebral compression.
