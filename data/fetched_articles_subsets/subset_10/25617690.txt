Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the primary inhibitor of 
urokinase-and tissue-type plasminogen activators (uPA and tPA), is an 
injury-response gene implicated in the development of tissue fibrosis and 
cardiovascular disease. PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in the 
balloon catheter-injured carotid and in the vascular smooth muscle cell 
(VSMC)-enriched neointima of ligated arteries. PAI-1/uPA complex formation and 
PAI-1 antiproteolytic activity can be inhibited, via proteolytic cleavage, by 
the small molecule antagonist tiplaxtinin which effectively increased the VSMC 
apoptotic index in vitro and attenuated carotid artery neointimal formation in 
vivo. In contrast to the active full-length serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN), 
elastase-cleaved PAI-1 (similar to tiplaxtinin) also promoted VSMC apoptosis in 
vitro and similarly reduced neointimal formation in vivo. The mechanism through 
which cleaved PAI-1 (CL-PAI-1) stimulates apoptosis appears to involve the TNF-α 
family member TWEAK (TNF-α weak inducer of apoptosis) and it's cognate receptor, 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-inducible 14 (FN14). CL-PAI-1 sensitizes cells to 
TWEAK-stimulated apoptosis while full-length PAI-1 did not, presumably due to 
its ability to down-regulate FN14 in a low density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 1 (LRP1)-dependent mechanism. It appears that prolonged exposure of 
VSMCs to CL-PAI-1 induces apoptosis by augmenting TWEAK/FN14 pro-apoptotic 
signaling. This work identifies a critical, anti-stenotic, role for a 
functionally-inactive (at least with regard to its protease inhibitory function) 
cleaved SERPIN. Therapies that promote the conversion of full-length to cleaved 
PAI-1 may have translational implications.
