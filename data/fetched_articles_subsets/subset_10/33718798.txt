Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis treatment strategies are not 
well defined in current literature or guidelines. One therapy option is an 
insulin infusion accompanied by a dextrose infusion to avoid hypoglycemia. The 
purpose of this case report is to highlight dosing considerations for dextrose 
infusions in nondiabetic patients. We describe a case of 
hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis in a 34-year-old nondiabetic 
female patient treated with a reduced-dose insulin infusion, complicated by 
hypoglycemic episodes requiring dextrose infusion titrations. Empirical 
initiation of a higher dextrose concentration infusion with glucose level 
titrations should be considered to avoid hypoglycemia for nondiabetic patients 
treated with an insulin infusion to lower triglyceride levels. In this case, 
clinical pharmacy assistance was imperative for successful treatment with a 
reduced-dose insulin infusion and titrated dextrose infusion in the management 
of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis.
