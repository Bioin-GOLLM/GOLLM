Spike protein mutations E484K and N501Y carried by SARS-CoV-2 variants have been 
associated with concerning changes of the virus, including resistance to 
neutralizing antibodies and increased transmissibility. While the concerning 
variants are fast spreading in various geographical areas, identification and 
monitoring of these variants are lagging far behind, due in large part to the 
slow speed and insufficient capacity of viral sequencing. In response to the 
unmet need for a fast and efficient screening tool, we developed a single-tube 
duplex molecular assay for rapid and simultaneous identification of E484K and 
N501Y mutations from nasopharyngeal swab (NS) samples within 2.5â€…h from sample 
preparation to report. Using this tool, we screened a total of 1135 clinical NS 
samples collected from COVID patients at 8 hospitals within the Hackensack 
Meridian Health network in New Jersey between late December 2020 and March 2021. 
Our data revealed dramatic increases in the frequencies of both E484K and N501Y 
over time, underscoring the need for continuous epidemiological monitoring.
