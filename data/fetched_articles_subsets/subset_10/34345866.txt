Cassiae semen are dried and ripe seeds of Cassia obtusifolia L. or Cassia tora 
L. (Fabaceae) and have been made into roasted tea or used as a traditional 
medicine in Asian countries. However, it was reported to result in liver and 
renal toxicity. The components of Cassiae semen that induce hepatotoxicity or 
nephrotoxicity remain unknown. In the present study, we evaluate the potential 
toxicity of 26 newly isolated compounds from Cassiae semen using quantitative 
structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods and co-culture of hepatic and 
renal cell approaches, and we aim to illustrate the relationship between the 
structural characteristics and cytotoxicity by general linear models (GLMs). 
Both the QSAR models and co-culture of hepatic and renal cell systems predicted 
that 6 compounds were potentially hepatotoxic, 10 compounds were potentially 
nephrotoxic, and specific anthraquinones and anthraquinone-glucosides were 
potential toxicants in Cassiae semen. Specific groups such as -OH and -OCH3 at 
the R1, R2, R3, and R7 positions influenced the cytotoxicity.
