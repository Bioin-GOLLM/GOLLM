Recognition of a start codon by the initiator aminoacyl-tRNA determines the 
reading frame of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation by the ribosome. In 
eukaryotes, the GTPase eIF5B collaborates in the correct positioning of the 
initiator Met-tRNAiMet on the ribosome in the later stages of translation 
initiation, gating entrance into elongation. Leveraging the long residence time 
of eIF5B on the ribosome recently identified by single-molecule fluorescence 
measurements, we determine the cryoEM structure of the naturally long-lived 
ribosome complex with eIF5B and Met-tRNAiMet immediately before transition into 
elongation. The structure uncovers an unexpected, eukaryotic specific and 
dynamic fidelity checkpoint implemented by eIF5B in concert with components of 
the large ribosomal subunit.
