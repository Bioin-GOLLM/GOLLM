BACKGROUND: The safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy in treatment-naïve non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with high programed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
expression and pre-existing interstitial lung disease (ILD) has not yet been 
determined. Here, we aimed to evaluate the prognosis, efficacy and safety 
associated with pembrolizumab in such settings.
METHODS: In this single-institution retrospective study conducted from May 2017 
to October 2019, pembrolizumab was administered to 72 Japanese patients with 
treatment-naïve advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%. 
Patients with ILD were assigned to the ILD group, and those without to the 
non-ILD group. Between-group comparisons were then performed.
RESULTS: Of the 72 patients, 61 (84.7%) were male. The median age was 70 years. 
A total of 64 patients (88.9%) had a smoking history, median PD-L1 TPS status 
was 77.5%, and 10 of the 72 patients (13.9%) had ILD on pretreatment computed 
tomography. The objective response rate (ORR) was 45.8% and disease control rate 
(DCR) was 75.0%. The ORR was 70.0% and DCR was 90.0% in the ILD group, while the 
ORR was 41.9% and DCR was 72.6% in the non-ILD group. The median overall 
survival was 568 days; the value in the non-ILD group was 521 days, while in the 
ILD group was not reached. There was no significant difference between the two 
groups (log-lank, P = 0.73).
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab was administered to patients with pre-existing ILD 
with no difference in prognosis compared to patients without ILD. In patients 
with ILD, physicians should consider the expected long-term prognosis and risk 
of adverse events.
