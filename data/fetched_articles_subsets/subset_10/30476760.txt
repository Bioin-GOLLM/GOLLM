Associations between air pollution and blood pressure (BP) traits can be 
modified by several candidate genes, which might explain differences in 
individual genetic susceptibility. Based on recent evidence hypothesized to link 
air pollution and BP traits, we examined whether the polymorphisms of CDH13-a 
candidate gene-would modify the relationship between them in adult Korean men. A 
total of 1816 subjects were included. We divided them into two groups of high or 
low to moderate exposure using the annual average concentration of particulate 
matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10). We conducted an interaction 
analysis of PM10 exposure using 200 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 
located within CDH13, in subjects with regard to BP traits and hypertension. The 
rs7500599 intronic SNP of CDH13 had the strongest signals for all BP traits 
including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and 
hypertension, by interacting with PM10 exposure. An additional stratified 
analysis showed that the effects of PM10 exposure on elevated BP and 
hypertension increased gradually in proportion to the number of minor alleles in 
this SNP. In addition, PM10 exposure in the TT or GT genotype groups did not 
show significant associations with BP traits, whereas in a homozygous risk 
allele (GG) group, PM10 exposure was significantly associated with BP traits and 
hypertension. For SBP, these patterns were reproducible at two independent 
sampling sites. This CDH13 polymorphism amplifies the negative associations of 
PM10 exposure and elevated BP or hypertension in Korean men.
