During the past decade, substantial progress has been made in the field of the 
genetics of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). These comprise a group of chronic 
myeloid neoplasms with abnormal cell morphology and progression to acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML), where revolutionary sequencing technologies have played a major 
role. Through extensive sequencing of a large number of MDS genomes, a 
comprehensive registry of driver mutations involved in the pathogenesis of MDS 
has been revealed, along with their impacts on clinical phenotype and prognosis. 
The most frequently affected molecules are involved in DNA methylations, 
chromatin modification, RNA splicing, transcription, signal transduction, 
cohesin regulation, and DNA repair. These mutations show strong positive and 
negative correlations with each other, suggesting the presence of functional 
interactions between mutations, which dictate disease progression. Because these 
mutations are associated with disease phenotype, drug response, and clinical 
outcomes, it is essential to be familiar with MDS genetics not only for better 
understanding of MDS pathogenesis but also for management of patients.
