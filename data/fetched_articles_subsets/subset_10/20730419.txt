RATIONALE: Compounds acting on delta opioid receptors (DOR) modulate 
anxiety-like behaviors, yet the site of action underlying this effect is 
unknown. DOR mRNA and protein are expressed in the central nucleus of the 
amygdala, a region that plays an important role in processing fear, stress, and 
anxiety. We hypothesized that this brain region may contribute to the modulation 
of anxiety by DOR drugs.
OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the role of DOR in the central 
amygdala in anxiety-like behaviors.
METHODS: The selective DOR agonist [D-Pen 2,5]-enkephalin (DPDPE) or antagonist 
naltrindole was bilaterally microinjected into the central nucleus of the 
amygdala of adult male Sprague Dawley rats and anxiety-like behaviors were 
assessed using the elevated plus maze. The effects of DOR agonists on heightened 
anxiety produced by stress were also investigated.
RESULTS: Rats injected with DPDPE into the central nucleus of the amygdala 
demonstrated less anxiety-like behavior, as evidenced by significantly greater 
number of open-arm entries and time spent in the open arms than controls. 
Naltrindole administered alone did not affect the duration or number of entries 
onto the open arms; however, naltrindole pre-treatment blocked the anxiolytic 
effects produced by DPDPE. Systemic administration of the selective DOR agonist, 
SNC80, or microinjection of DPDPE into the central amygdala prior to a swim 
stress blocked the anxiogenic effect produced by the swim stress.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide direct evidence that activation of DOR in 
the central amygdala reduces anxiety-like behavior and suggest that DOR in this 
area are important for regulating anxious states.
