Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is caused by 
mutations in the TYMP gene, which encodes thymidine phosphorylase (TP). As a 
cytosolic metabolic enzyme, TP defects affect biological processes that are 
thought to not be limited to the abnormal replication of mitochondrial DNA. This 
study aimed to elucidate the characteristic metabolic alterations and associated 
homeostatic regulation caused by TYMP deficiency. The pathogenicity of novel 
TYMP variants was evaluated in terms of clinical features, genetic analysis, and 
structural instability. We analyzed plasma samples from three patients with 
MNGIE; three patients with m.3243A > G mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic 
acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); and four healthy controls (HC) using 
both targeted and untargeted metabolomics techniques. Transcriptomics analysis 
and bioenergetic studies were performed on skin fibroblasts from participants in 
these three groups. A TYMP overexpression experiment was conducted to rescue the 
observed changes. Compared with controls, specific alterations in nucleosides, 
bile acids, and steroid metabolites were identified in the plasma of MNGIE 
patients. Comparable mitochondrial dysfunction was present in fibroblasts from 
patients with TYMP deficiency and in those from patients with the m.3243A > G 
mutation. Distinctively decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 
(SREBP) regulated cholesterol metabolism and fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis as 
well as reduced FA degradation were revealed in fibroblasts with TYMP 
deficiency. The restoration of thymidine phosphorylase activity rescued the 
observed changes in MNGIE fibroblasts. Our findings indicated that more 
widespread metabolic disturbance may be caused by TYMP deficiency in addition to 
mitochondrial dysfunction, which expands our knowledge of the biochemical 
outcome of TYMP deficiency. KEY MESSAGES: Distinct metabolic profiles in 
patients with TYMP deficiency compared to those with m.3243A > G mutation. TYMP 
deficiency leads to a global disruption of nucleoside metabolism. Cholesterol 
and fatty acid metabolism are inhibited in individuals with MNGIE. TYMP is 
functionally related to SREBP-regulated pathways. Potential metabolite 
biomarkers that could be valuable clinical tools to improve the diagnosis of 
MNGIE.
