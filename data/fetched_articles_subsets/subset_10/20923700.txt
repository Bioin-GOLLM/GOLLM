Cardiomyopathies are severe degenerative disorders of the myocardium that lead 
to heart failure. During the last three decades bovine dilated cardiomyopathy 
(BDCMP) was observed worldwide in cattle of Holstein-Friesian origin. In the 
Swiss cattle population BDCMP affects Fleckvieh and Red Holstein breeds. The 
heart of affected animals is enlarged due to dilation of both ventricles. 
Clinical signs are caused by systolic dysfunction and affected individuals die 
as a result of severe heart insufficiency. BDCMP follows an autosomal recessive 
pattern of inheritance and the disease-causing locus was mapped to bovine 
chromosome 18 (BTA18). In the present study we describe the successful 
identification of the causative mutation in the OPA3 gene located on BTA18 that 
was previously reported to cause 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type III in 
Iraqi-Jewish patients. We demonstrated conclusive genetic and functional 
evidence that the nonsense mutation c.343C>T in the bovine OPA3 gene causes the 
late-onset dilated cardiomyopathy in Red Holstein cattle.
