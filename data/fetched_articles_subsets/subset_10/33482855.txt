INTRODUCTION: Aicardi-Goutières (AGS) is a rare immune dysregulated disease due 
to mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1, or IFIH1. 
Clinical features include basal ganglia calcifications, white matter 
abnormalities, and cerebral atrophy. Severe systemic inflammation and chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) are extremely rare in AGS. Herein, we report a patient 
presenting with systemic inflammation and CKD to broaden the clinical phenotype 
spectrum of the RNASEH2B defect.
METHODS: All testing and molecular genetic analysis were performed after 
obtaining the informed consent of the parents. Demographic, clinical, and 
laboratory findings were abstracted from outpatient and inpatient encounters. 
Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans, and 
renal biopsy histopathology reports were reviewed and summarized. Whole exome 
sequencing (WES) was performed on peripheral blood cells. After exposure to 
cGAMP in vitro for 24 h, mRNA expression of 12 IFN-stimulated cytokine genes in 
PBMCs was assessed. Serum cytokine levels were detected by Milliplex.
RESULTS: A 11-year-old girl presented with recurrent aseptic fever, arthritis, 
chilblains, failure to thrive, mild hearing loss, and neurological 
manifestations. Laboratory and immunologic findings demonstrated lymphopenia, 
low complement levels, positive autoantibodies, elevated levels of acute-phase 
reactants and inflammatory cytokines. Cerebral imaging showed cerebral atrophy, 
white matter abnormalities, and intracranial calcification. Renal biopsy showed 
glomerular sclerosis in 3 of 14 glomeruli, infiltration of lymphocytes and other 
mononuclear cells. WES revealed a homozygous and heterozygous mutations in 
RNASEH2B. Over-expression of IFN-stimulated cytokine genes was observed, 
including IFI44, IFI27, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, ISG15, OAS1, and SIGLEC1.
CONCLUSIONS: To date, only two cases with AGS have been reported to have renal 
disease. Here, we describe a patient with both homozygous and heterozygous 
variants in RNASEH2B, presenting with neurological manifestations, persistently 
systemic autoinflammation, and CKD. CKD has never been reported in patients with 
AGS due to the RNASEH2B defect.
