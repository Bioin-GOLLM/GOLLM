Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) is responsible for catalyzing the attachment of 
the eight-carbon fatty acid octanoyl to the Ser3 side chain of the peptide 
ghrelin to generate the active form of this metabolic hormone. As such, GOAT is 
viewed as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and 
diabetes mellitus. Here, we review recent progress in the development of cell 
and in vitro assays to measure GOAT action and the identification of several 
synthetic GOAT inhibitors. In particular, we discuss the design, synthesis, and 
characterization of the bisubstrate analog GO-CoA-Tat and its ability to 
modulate weight and blood glucose in mice. We also highlight current challenges 
and future research directions in our biomedical understanding of this 
fascinating ghrelin processing enzyme.
