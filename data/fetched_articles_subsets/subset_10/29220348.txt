Strigolactones (SLs) are well known for their role in repressing shoot 
branching. In pea, increased transcript levels of SL biosynthesis genes are 
observed in stems of highly branched SL deficient (ramosus1 (rms1) and rms5) and 
SL response (rms3 and rms4) mutants indicative of negative feedback control. In 
contrast, the highly branched rms2 mutant has reduced transcript levels of SL 
biosynthesis genes. Grafting studies and hormone quantification led to a model 
where RMS2 mediates a shoot-to-root feedback signal that regulates both SL 
biosynthesis gene transcript levels and xylem sap levels of cytokinin exported 
from roots. Here we cloned RMS2 using synteny with Medicago truncatula and 
demonstrated that it encodes a putative auxin receptor of the AFB4/5 clade. 
Phenotypes similar to rms2 were found in Arabidopsis afb4/5 mutants, including 
increased shoot branching, low expression of SL biosynthesis genes and high 
auxin levels in stems. Moreover, afb4/5 and rms2 display a specific resistance 
to the herbicide picloram. Yeast-two-hybrid experiments supported the hypothesis 
that the RMS2 protein functions as an auxin receptor. SL root feeding using 
hydroponics repressed auxin levels in stems and down-regulated transcript levels 
of auxin biosynthesis genes within one hour. This auxin down-regulation was also 
observed in plants treated with the polar auxin transport inhibitor NPA. 
Together these data suggest a homeostatic feedback loop in which auxin 
up-regulates SL synthesis in an RMS2-dependent manner and SL down-regulates 
auxin synthesis in an RMS3 and RMS4-dependent manner.
