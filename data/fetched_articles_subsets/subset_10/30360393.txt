Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a worldwide health problem caused by 
resistance to insulin action. This chronic debilitating diseaseis preceded by a 
stage, known as prediabetes, in which a healthy lifestyle can delay the disease. 
The discovery of biochemical changes in prediabetes is important to identify 
individuals at risk of developing T2DM and in explaining disease pathogenesis. 
Adiponectin is secreted by fat cells and is linked with insulin resistance. 
Adiponectin levels are dysregulated in prediabetic subjects. This relationship 
had not been tested in Jordan. We recruited 130 subjects with prediabetes and 
130 control subjects. We measured serum levels of adiponectin and genotyped 
subjects for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ADIPOQ gene; 
rs266729, rs1501299 and rs2241766. In multivariate analysis, we found that serum 
adiponectin lowers the risk of prediabetes (p = 0.002; odds ratio (OR), 0.764; 
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.646⁻0.905). The rs1501299 SNP of the ADIPOQ gene 
was associated with prediabetes in our population (p = 0.041). Specifically, in 
multivariate analysis, the GT genotype of rs1501299 increased the risk of 
prediabetes (p = 0.010; OR, 2.350; 95% CI, 1.231⁻4.486) as well as the TT 
genotype (p = 0.006; OR, 4.774; 95% CI, 1.551⁻14.693). Our findings indicate 
that serum adiponectin and SNPs in the ADIPOQ gene are associated with 
prediabetes in Jordan.
