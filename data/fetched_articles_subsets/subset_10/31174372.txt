Metabolomics is one of the latest omics technologies that has been applied 
successfully in many areas of life sciences. Despite being relatively new, a 
plethora of publications over the years have exploited the opportunities 
provided through this data and question driven approach. Most importantly, 
metabolomics studies have produced great breakthroughs in biomarker discovery, 
identification of novel metabolites and more detailed characterisation of 
biological pathways in many organisms. However, translation of the research 
outcomes into clinical tests and user-friendly interfaces has been hindered due 
to many factors, some of which have been outlined hereafter. This position paper 
is the summary of discussion on translational metabolomics undertaken during a 
peer session of the Australian and New Zealand Metabolomics Conference (ANZMET 
2018) held in Auckland, New Zealand. Here, we discuss some of the key areas in 
translational metabolomics including existing challenges and suggested 
solutions, as well as how to expand the clinical and industrial application of 
metabolomics. In addition, we share our perspective on how full translational 
capability of metabolomics research can be explored.
