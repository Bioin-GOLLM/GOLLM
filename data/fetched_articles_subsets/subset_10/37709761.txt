Native mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful technique for interrogating membrane 
protein complexes and their interactions with other molecules. A key aspect of 
the technique is the ability to preserve native-like structures and noncovalent 
interactions, which can be challenging depending on the choice of detergent. 
Different strategies have been employed to reduce charge on protein complexes to 
minimize activation and preserve non-covalent interactions. Here, we report the 
synthesis of a class of polyamine detergents tailored for native MS studies of 
membrane proteins. These detergents, a series of spermine covalently attached to 
various alkyl tails, are exceptional charge-reducing molecules, exhibiting a 
ten-fold enhanced potency over spermine. Addition of polyamine detergents to 
proteins solubilized in maltoside detergents results in improved, charge-reduced 
native mass spectra and reduced dissociation of subunits. Polyamine detergents 
open new opportunities to investigate membrane proteins in different detergent 
environments that have thwarted previous native MS studies.
