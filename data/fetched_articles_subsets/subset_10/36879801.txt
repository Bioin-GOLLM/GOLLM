Skeletal muscle (SM) pain and fatigue are common in Fabry disease (FD). Here, we 
undertook the investigation of the energetic mechanisms related to FD-SM 
phenotype. A reduced tolerance to aerobic activity and lactate accumulation 
occurred in FD-mice and patients. Accordingly, in murine FD-SM we detected an 
increase in fast/glycolytic fibers, mirrored by glycolysis upregulation. In 
FD-patients, we confirmed a high glycolytic rate and the underutilization of 
lipids as fuel. In the quest for a tentative mechanism, we found HIF-1 
upregulated in FD-mice and patients. This finding goes with miR-17 upregulation 
that is responsible for metabolic remodeling and HIF-1 accumulation. 
Accordingly, miR-17 antagomir inhibited HIF-1 accumulation, reverting the 
metabolic-remodeling in FD-cells. Our findings unveil a Warburg effect in FD, an 
anaerobic-glycolytic switch under normoxia induced by miR-17-mediated HIF-1 
upregulation. Exercise-intolerance, blood-lactate increase, and the underlying 
miR-17/HIF-1 pathway may become useful therapeutic targets and 
diagnostic/monitoring tools in FD.
