Xanthohumol (XN) and four minor hops prenylflavonoids: α,β-dihydroxanthohumol 
(2HXN), isoxanthohumol (IXN), 8-prenylnaringenin (8PN), and 6-prenylnaringenin 
(6PN), were tested for antiproliferative activity towards human cancer and 
normal cell lines. Nonprenylated naringenin (NG) was used as a model compound. 
Xanthohumol, α,β-dihydroxanthohumol and 6-prenylnaringenin were the most active 
compounds. Xanthohumol exhibited higher antiproliferative activity than 
cisplatin (CP) against five cancer cell lines: ovarian resistant to cisplatin 
A2780cis, breast MDA-MB-231 and T-47D, prostate PC-3, and colon HT-29. 
Isoxanthohumol was more potent than cisplatin against breast cancer cell lines 
MDA-MB-231 and T-47D whereas 6-prenylnaringenin was stronger than cisplatin 
against breast cancer cell line T-47D. It was found that tested chalcones 
possessed highly selective antiproliferative activity towards all tested breast 
cancer lines compared to the normal breast MCF 10A cell line (the calculated 
selectivity index ranged from 5 to 10). Low antiproliferative activity of 
naringenin indicates the importance of the prenyl group with respect to 
antiproliferative activity.
