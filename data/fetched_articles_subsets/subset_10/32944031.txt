Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) was the first ubiquitin-like modifier 
protein identified that acts by protein conjugation (ISGylation) and is thought 
to modulate IFN-induced inflammation. Here, we report a new patient from a 
non-consanguineous Argentinian family, who was followed for recurrent ulcerative 
skin lesions, cerebral calcifications and lung disease. Whole Exome Sequencing 
(WES) revealed two novel compound heterozygous variants (c.285del and 
c.299_312del, NM_005101.4 GRCh37(hg19), both classified as pathogenic according 
to ACMG criteria) in the ISG15 gene, resulting in a complete deficiency due to 
disruption of the second ubiquitin domain of the corresponding protein. The 
clinical phenotype of this patient is unique given the presence of recurrent 
pulmonary manifestations and the absence of mycobacterial infections, thus 
resulting in a phenotype distinct from that previously described in patients 
with biallelic loss-of-function (LOF) ISG15 variants. This case highlights the 
role of ISG15 as an immunomodulating factor whose LOF variants result in 
heterogeneous clinical presentations.
