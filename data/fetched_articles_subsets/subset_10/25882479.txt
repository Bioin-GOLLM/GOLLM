A fundamental question in protein folding is whether proteins fold through one 
or multiple trajectories. While most experiments indicate a single pathway, 
simulations suggest proteins can fold through many parallel pathways. Here, we 
use a combination of chemical denaturant, mechanical force and site-directed 
mutations to demonstrate the presence of multiple unfolding pathways in a 
simple, two-state folding protein. We show that these multiple pathways have 
structurally different transition states, and that seemingly small changes in 
protein sequence and environment can strongly modulate the flux between the 
pathways. These results suggest that in vivo, the crowded cellular environment 
could strongly influence the mechanisms of protein folding and unfolding. Our 
study resolves the apparent dichotomy between experimental and theoretical 
studies, and highlights the advantage of using a multipronged approach to reveal 
the complexities of a protein's free-energy landscape.
