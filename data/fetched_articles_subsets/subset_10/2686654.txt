Chemical-enzymatic synthesis of an artificial gene encoding leader peptide and 
22 N-terminal amino acids of mature carboxypeptidase G2 from Pseudomonas sp. 
followed by enterokinase signal sequence (Asp4Lys) has been accomplished. The 
resulted DNA was fused with semi-synthetic gene coding for polypeptide 4-157 of 
mature human tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and then placed under control of early 
promoters of T7 bacteriophage. The expression products of the construct obtained 
was analysed using anti-TNF anti-serum. In E.coli leader peptide was cleaved off 
during translocation through inner membrane and the resultant product was found 
in membrane fraction.
