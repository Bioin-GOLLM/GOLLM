EZH2 inhibitors have gained great interest for their use as anti-cancer 
therapeutics. However, most research has focused on EZH2 mutant cancers and 
recently adverse effects of EZH2 inactivation have come to light. To determine 
whether colorectal cancer cells respond to EZH2 inhibition and to explore which 
factors influence the degree of response, we treated a panel of 20 organoid 
lines derived from human colon tumors with different concentrations of the EZH2 
inhibitor GSK126. The resulting responses were associated with mutation status, 
gene expression and responses to other drugs. We found that the response to 
GSK126 treatment greatly varied between organoid lines. Response associated with 
the mutation status of ATRX and PAX2, and correlated with BIK expression. It 
also correlated well with response to Nutlin-3a which inhibits MDM2-p53 
interaction thereby activating p53 signaling. Sensitivity to EZH2 ablation 
depended on the presence of wild type p53, as tumor organoids became resistant 
when p53 was mutated or knocked down. Our exploratory study provides insight 
into which genetic factors predict sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. In addition, 
we show that the response to EZH2 inhibition requires wild type p53. We conclude 
that a subset of colorectal cancer patients may benefit from EZH2-targeting 
therapies.
