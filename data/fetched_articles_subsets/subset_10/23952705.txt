OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) is involved in human insulin secretion by assessing 
the metabolic impact of the new CFTR corrector-ivacaftor.
METHODS: This open-label pilot study was conducted in CF patients with the G551D 
mutation given new prescriptions for ivacaftor. At baseline and 4 wk after daily 
ivacaftor therapy, intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) and oral glucose 
tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed.
RESULTS: Five patients aged 6-52 were studied. After 1 month on ivacaftor, the 
insulin response to oral glucose improved by 66-178% in all subjects except one 
with long-standing diabetes. OGTT glucose levels were not lower in the two 
individuals with diabetes or the two with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), but 
the glucose tolerance category in the subject with impaired glucose tolerance 
(IGT) improved to NGT after treatment. In response to intravenous glucose, the 
only patient whose acute insulin secretion did not improve had newly diagnosed, 
untreated CFRD. The others improved by 51-346%. Acute insulin secretion was 
partially restored in two subjects with no measurable acute insulin response at 
baseline, including the one with IGT and the one with long-standing diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: This small pilot study suggests there is a direct role of CFTR in 
human insulin secretion. Larger, long-term longitudinal studies are necessary to 
determine whether early initiation of CFTR correction, particularly in young 
children with CF who have not yet lost considerable β-cell mass, will delay or 
prevent development of diabetes in this high-risk population.
