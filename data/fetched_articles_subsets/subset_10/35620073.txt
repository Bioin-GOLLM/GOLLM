Metabolism is important for the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) 
and drives cellular fate. Due to the scarcity of HSCs, it has been technically 
challenging to perform metabolome analyses gaining insight into HSC metabolic 
regulatory networks. Here, we present two targeted liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry approaches that enable the detection of metabolites after 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting when sample amounts are limited. One 
protocol covers signaling lipids and retinoids, while the second detects 
tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites and amino acids. For complete details on 
the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Schönberger et al. 
(2022).
