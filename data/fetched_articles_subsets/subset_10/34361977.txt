As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome sequencing are being 
used to investigate its transmission and evolution. Against the backdrop of the 
global emergence of "variants of concern" (VOCs) during December 2020 and an 
upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome 
sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural 
approaches were undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the 
fitness of the current circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 
newly identified lineages B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 were predominantly 
circulating. The signature mutations possessed by these strains were L452R, 
T478K, E484Q, D614G and P681R in the spike protein, including within the 
receptor-binding domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 
484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The 
structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R, T478K and E484Q revealed that these 
may possibly result in increased ACE2 binding while P681R in the furin cleavage 
site could increase the rate of S1-S2 cleavage, resulting in better 
transmissibility. The two RBD mutations, L452R and E484Q, indicated decreased 
binding to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their 
neutralization potential. Further in vitro/in vivo studies would help confirm 
the phenotypic changes of the mutant strains. Overall, the study revealed that 
the newly emerged variants were responsible for the second wave of COVID-19 in 
Maharashtra. Lineage B.1.617.2 has been designated as a VOC delta and B.1.617.1 
as a variant of interest kappa, and they are being widely reported in the rest 
of the country as well as globally. Continuous monitoring of these and emerging 
variants in India is essential.
