α9-Containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are key targets for the 
treatment of neuropathic pain. α-Conotoxin RgIA4 is a peptide antagonist of 
human α9α10 nAChRs with high selectivity. However, structural rearrangement 
reveals a potential liability for clinical applications. We herein report our 
designer RgIA analogues stabilized by methylene thioacetal as nonopioid 
analgesic agents. We demonstrate that replacing disulfide loop I [CysI-CysIII] 
with methylene thioacetal in the RgIA skeleton results in activity loss, whereas 
substitution of loop II [CysII-CysIV] can be accommodated. The lead molecule, 
RgIA-5524, exhibits highly selective inhibition of α9α10 nAChRs with an IC50 of 
0.9 nM and much reduced degradation in human serum. In vivo studies showed that 
RgIA-5524 relieves chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in wild type but not α9 
knockout mouse models, demonstrating that α9-containing nAChRs are necessary for 
the therapeutic effects. This work highlights the application of methylene 
thioacetal as a disulfide surrogate in conotoxin-based, disulfide-rich peptide 
drugs.
