Pharmacological tools for chronic visceral pain management are still limited and 
inadequate. A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) agonists are effective in different 
models of persistent pain. Recently, their activity has been related to the 
block of N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Cav2.2) in dorsal root ganglia 
(DRG) neurons. The present work aimed to evaluate the efficacy of A3AR agonists 
in reducing postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity in both male and female 
rats. Colitis was induced by the intracolonic instillation of 
2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS; 30 mg in 0.25 mL 50% EtOH). Visceral 
hypersensitivity was assessed by measuring the visceromotor response and the 
abdominal withdrawal reflex to colorectal distension. The effects of A3AR 
agonists (MRS5980 and Cl-IB-MECA) were evaluated over time after DNBS injection 
and compared to that of the selective Cav2.2 blocker PD173212, and the 
clinically used drug linaclotide. A3AR agonists significantly reduced 
DNBS-evoked visceral pain both in the postinflammatory (14 and 21 days after 
DNBS injection) and persistence (28 and 35 days after DNBS) phases. Efficacy was 
comparable to effects induced by linaclotide. PD173212 fully reduced abdominal 
hypersensitivity to control values, highlighting the role of Cav2.2. The effects 
of MRS5980 and Cl-IB-MECA were completely abolished by the selective A3AR 
antagonist MRS1523. Furthermore, patch-clamp recordings showed that A3AR 
agonists inhibited Cav2.2 in dorsal root ganglia neurons isolated from either 
control or DNBS-treated rats. The effect on Ca2+ current was PD173212-sensitive 
and prevented by MRS1523. A3AR agonists are effective in relieving visceral 
hypersensitivity induced by DNBS, suggesting a potential therapeutic role 
against abdominal pain.
