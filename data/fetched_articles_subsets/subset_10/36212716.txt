BACKGROUND: Uveal Melanoma (UM) is a potentially lethal cancer, and epigenetics 
may participate in the regulation of MEK resistance. This study is aimed at 
targeting the epigenetic kinase to overcome the resistance to MEK inhibitor.
METHOD: We developed the 92.1 and OMM1 MEK-inhibitor resistant cell lines by 
culturing them in the trametinib (Tra) mixed medium. We utilized CCK8 analysis 
for detecting the viability of the cell. Western blot was used to determine the 
ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. Small compound library screening assays were 
carried out by CCK8 analysis. To test the apoptosis, we employed flow cytometric 
analysis with Annexin-V/PI. Western blot and CCK8 were used to explore the 
epigenetic regulation of KDM5B in MEK-resistance cell lines. To knock out the 
expression level of KDM5B, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 by lentivirus delivering 
well-validated shRNAs in pLKO.1 vector. The directly binding affinity of 
KDOAM-25 to KDM5B was determined by drug affinity responsive target stability 
(DARTS) and microscale thermophoresis (MST).
RESULTS: The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt (T308) was inhibited in OMM1 cell 
lines. However, inhibition of Tra was abolished in OMM1-R cell lines. From a 
compound screening assay, we identified that KDOAM-25 robustly inhibited the 
viability and colony formation of MEK-resistance cell lines. Furthermore, 
KDOAM-25 significantly promoted cell death in OMM1-R cells. H3K4me3 
(tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3) and H3K27ac (acetyl of lysine 27 on 
histone H3) were both upregulated in OMM1-R cells. Tra significantly inhibited 
the expression of KDM5B in OMM1-P cells. However, the effect on KDM5B was 
abolished in OMM1-R cells. Knockdown of KDM5B robustly suppressed the cell 
viability in OMM1-R cells. KDOAM-25 directly interacted with KDM5B.
CONCLUSION: KDOAM-25 inhibited the viability and colony formation and promoted 
cell death of MEK-resistance cell lines through H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, indicating 
that KDOAM-25 may be a potential therapeutic agent for MEK resistance in UM 
patients.
