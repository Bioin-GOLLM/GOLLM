Background. Two adjacent regions upstream CDKN2B on chromosome 9p21 have been 
associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and progression of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). The precise location and number of risk variants have not been completely 
delineated and a possible synergistic relationship between the adjacent regions 
is not fully addressed. By a population based cross-sectional case-control 
design, we genotyped 18 SNPs upstream of CDKN2B tagging 138 kb in and around two 
LD-blocks associated with CVD and T2D and investigated associations with T2D, 
angina pectoris (AP), myocardial infarction (MI), coronary heart disease (CHD; 
AP or AMI), and stroke using 5,564 subjects from HUNT2. Results. Single point 
and haplotype analysis showed evidence for only one common T2D risk haplotype 
(rs10757282∣rs10811661: OR = 1.19, P = 2.0 × 10(-3)) in the region. We confirmed 
the strong association between SNPs in the 60 kb CVD region with AP, MI, and CHD 
(P < 0.01). Conditioning on the lead SNPs in the region, we observed two 
suggestive independent single SNP association signals for MI, rs2065501  (P = 
0.03) and rs3217986  (P = 0.04). Conclusions. We confirmed the association of 
known variants within the 9p21 interval with T2D and CHD. Our results further 
suggest that additional CHD susceptibility variants exist in this region.
