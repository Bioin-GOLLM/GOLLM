OBJECTIVE: Acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX1) deficiency is a rare disorder of peroxisomal 
very-long chain fatty acid oxidation. No reports detailing attempted treatment, 
longitudinal imaging, or neuropathology exist. We describe the natural history 
of clinical symptoms and brain imaging in two siblings with ACOX1 deficiency, 
including the younger sibling's response to allogeneic unrelated donor 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
METHODS: We conducted retrospective chart review to obtain clinical history, 
neuro-imaging, and neuropathology data. ACOX1 genotyping were performed to 
confirm the disease. In vitro fibroblast and neural stem cell fatty acid 
oxidation assays were also performed.
RESULTS: Both patients experienced a fatal neurodegenerative course, with 
late-stage cerebellar and cerebral gray matter atrophy. Serial brain magnetic 
resonance imaging in the younger sibling indicated demyelination began in the 
medulla and progressed rostrally to include the white matter of the cerebellum, 
pons, midbrain, and eventually subcortical white matter. The successfully 
engrafted younger sibling had less brain inflammation, cortical atrophy, and 
neuronal loss on neuro-imaging and neuropathology compared to the untreated 
older sister. Fibroblasts and stem cells demonstrated deficient very long chain 
fatty acid oxidation.
INTERPRETATION: Although HSCT did not halt the course of ACOX1 deficiency, it 
reduced the extent of white matter inflammation in the brain. Demyelination 
continued because of ongoing neuronal loss, which may be due to inability of 
transplant to prevent progression of gray matter disease, adverse effects of 
chronic corticosteroid use to control graft-versus-host disease, or intervention 
occurring beyond a critical point for therapeutic efficacy.
