In virtually all bacteria, the cell wall is crucial for mechanical integrity and 
for determining cell shape. Escherichia coli's rod-like shape is maintained via 
the spatiotemporal patterning of cell-wall synthesis by the actin homologue 
MreB. Here, we transiently inhibited cell-wall synthesis in E. coli to generate 
cell-wall-deficient, spherical L-forms, and found that they robustly reverted to 
a rod-like shape within several generations after inhibition cessation. The 
chemical composition of the cell wall remained essentially unchanged during this 
process, as indicated by liquid chromatography. Throughout reversion, MreB 
localized to inwardly curved regions of the cell, and fluorescent cell wall 
labelling revealed that MreB targets synthesis to those regions. When exposed to 
the MreB inhibitor A22, reverting cells regrew a cell wall but failed to recover 
a rod-like shape. Our results suggest that MreB provides the geometric measure 
that allows E. coli to actively establish and regulate its morphology.
