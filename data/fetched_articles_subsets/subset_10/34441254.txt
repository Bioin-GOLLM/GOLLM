The cobas® EGFR Test provides a semiquantitative index (SQI) that reflects the 
proportion of mutated versus wild-type copies of the EGFR gene in plasma. The 
significance of SQI as an indirect measure of the variant allele frequency (VAF) 
or mutated copies/mL remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
correlation of SQI with the VAF and the number of mutated copies/mL obtained by 
a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) test in NSCLC samples. The study included 118 
plasma samples from a retrospective cohort of 25 stage IV adenocarcinoma 
patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions (Ex19Del), obtained before and during 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. Both SQI and VAF and SQI and mutated 
copies/mL showed the same significant correlation (r2 = 0.79, p < 0.00001) 
across the whole study cohort. We found better correlation in samples collected 
at the baseline between SQI and VAF (r2 = 0.94, p < 0.00001) and SQI and mutated 
copies/mL (r2 = 0.97, p < 0.00001) compared to samples collected during TKI 
treatment: r2 = 0.76; p < 0.00001 for SQI and VAF and r2 = 0.75; p < 0.00001 for 
SQI and mutated copies/mL. The study indicates that SQI is a robust quantitative 
indirect measure of VAF and the number of mutated copies/mL in plasma from 
patients with an EGFR Ex19Del mutation. Further studies are desirable to assess 
the SQI cut-off values related to the clinical status of the patient.
