Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is a lysosomal storage disease exhibiting 
progressive intellectual disability, motor impairment, and premature death. 
There is currently no cure or corrective treatment. The disease results from 
mutations in the gene encoding mucolipin-1, a transient receptor potential 
channel believed to play a key role in lysosomal calcium egress. Loss of 
mucolipin-1 and subsequent defects lead to a host of cellular aberrations, 
including accumulation of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in neurons and other cell 
types, microgliosis and, as reported here, cerebellar Purkinje cell loss. 
Several studies have demonstrated that N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ, also 
known as miglustat), an inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), 
successfully delays the onset of motor deficits, improves longevity, and rescues 
some of the cerebellar abnormalities (e.g., Purkinje cell death) seen in another 
lysosomal disease known as Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). Given the similarities in 
pathology between MLIV and NPC, we examined whether miglustat would be 
efficacious in ameliorating disease progression in MLIV. Using a full 
mucolipin-1 knockout mouse (Mcoln1-/-), we found that early miglustat treatment 
delays the onset and progression of motor deficits, delays cerebellar Purkinje 
cell loss, and reduces cerebellar microgliosis characteristic of MLIV disease. 
Quantitative mass spectrometry analyses provided new data on the GSL profiles of 
murine MLIV brain tissue and showed that miglustat partially restored the wild 
type profile of white matter enriched lipids. Collectively, our findings 
indicate that early miglustat treatment delays the progression of clinically 
relevant pathology in an MLIV mouse model, and therefore supports consideration 
of miglustat as a therapeutic agent for MLIV disease in humans.
