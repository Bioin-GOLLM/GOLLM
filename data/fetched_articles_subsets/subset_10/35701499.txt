Regulation of endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) responses by the chemokine 
CXCL4 is implicated in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, with CXCL4 proposed 
to potentiate TLR responses by binding to nucleic acid TLR ligands and 
facilitating their endosomal delivery. Here we report that in human 
monocytes/macrophages, CXCL4 initiates signaling cascades and downstream 
epigenomic reprogramming that change the profile of the TLR8 response by 
selectively amplifying inflammatory gene transcription and interleukin (IL)-1β 
production, while partially attenuating the interferon response. 
Mechanistically, costimulation by CXCL4 and TLR8 synergistically activates TBK1 
and IKKε, repurposes these kinases towards an inflammatory response via coupling 
with IRF5, and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. CXCL4 signaling, in a 
cooperative and synergistic manner with TLR8, induces chromatin remodeling and 
activates de novo enhancers associated with inflammatory genes. Our findings 
thus identify new regulatory mechanisms of TLR responses relevant for cytokine 
storm, and suggest targeting the TBK1-IKKε-IRF5 axis may be beneficial in 
inflammatory diseases.
