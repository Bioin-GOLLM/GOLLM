The cardiac phosphoprotein phospholemman (PLM) regulates the cardiac sodium 
pump, activating the pump when phosphorylated and inhibiting it when 
palmitoylated. Protein palmitoylation, the reversible attachment of a 16 carbon 
fatty acid to a cysteine thiol, is catalyzed by the Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) 
motif-containing palmitoyl acyltransferases. The cell surface palmitoyl 
acyltransferase DHHC5 regulates a growing number of cellular processes, but 
relatively few DHHC5 substrates have been identified to date. We examined the 
expression of DHHC isoforms in ventricular muscle and report that DHHC5 is among 
the most abundantly expressed DHHCs in the heart and localizes to 
caveolin-enriched cell surface microdomains. DHHC5 coimmunoprecipitates with PLM 
in ventricular myocytes and transiently transfected cells. Overexpression and 
silencing experiments indicate that DHHC5 palmitoylates PLM at two juxtamembrane 
cysteines, C40 and C42, although C40 is the principal palmitoylation site. PLM 
interaction with and palmitoylation by DHHC5 is independent of the DHHC5 
PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology (PDZ) binding motif, but requires a âˆ¼ 120 amino 
acid region of the DHHC5 intracellular C-tail immediately after the fourth 
transmembrane domain. PLM C42A but not PLM C40A inhibits the Na pump, indicating 
PLM palmitoylation at C40 but not C42 is required for PLM-mediated inhibition of 
pump activity. In conclusion, we demonstrate an enzyme-substrate relationship 
for DHHC5 and PLM and describe a means of substrate recruitment not hitherto 
described for this acyltransferase. We propose that PLM palmitoylation by DHHC5 
promotes phospholipid interactions that inhibit the Na pump.
