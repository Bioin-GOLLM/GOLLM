AIM: To investigate whether the factor V Leiden mutation (FVL), the prothrombin 
gene G20210A variant or the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T 
genotype are risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) thrombosis or 
intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in neonates.
METHODS: Thirteen full-term infants with cerebral infarct documented with 
magnetic resonance imaging were assessed with the whole spectrum of assays for 
thrombophilia including the three DNA-based prothrombotic factors. The frequency 
of congenital defects was compared with that observed in 38 healthy full-term 
infants. The genetic defects were also assessed in 55 premature neonates, 
gestational age <32 wk, 17 of whom developed IVH, grade II-IV. The remaining 38 
premature neonates without IVH were used as controls.
RESULTS: In the CNS thrombosis group: a prothrombotic factor was detected in 53% 
of patients and an underlying disease or a triggering event in 61.5%. The 
frequency of FVL in thrombosed neonates was higher (23%) than in the group of 
healthy full-term infants (10.5%), although it did not reach statistical 
significance. IVH developed in 30.9% of premature neonates. Apart from several 
maternal or neonatal risk factors for IVH, FII G20210A was found in a 
considerably higher prevalence in the cohort of neonates with IVH (12%) than in 
those without (2%), although the difference was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of cerebral thrombosis or IVH in neonates is 
multifactorial. Along with underlying diseases or triggering events, congenital 
prothrombotic factors (FVL or FII G20210A) showed a trend towards a higher 
frequency in full-term infants with CNS thrombosis or premature neonates with 
IVH than in controls. However, their contribution to neonatal cerebral 
thrombosis or IVH remains to be determined.
