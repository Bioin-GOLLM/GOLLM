Astrocytes express ion channels, transmitter receptors, and transporters and, 
thus, are endowed with the machinery to sense and respond to neuronal activity. 
Recent studies have implicated that astrocytes play important roles in 
physiology, but these cells also emerge as crucial actors in epilepsy. 
Astrocytes are abundantly coupled through gap junctions allowing them to 
redistribute elevated K(+) and transmitter concentrations from sites of enhanced 
neuronal activity. Investigation of specimens from patients with 
pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy and epilepsy models revealed 
alterations in expression, localization, and function of astroglial K(+) and 
water channels. In addition, malfunction of glutamate transporters and the 
astrocytic glutamate-converting enzyme, glutamine synthetase, has been observed 
in epileptic tissue. These findings suggest that dysfunctional astrocytes are 
crucial players in epilepsy and should be considered as promising targets for 
new therapeutic strategies.
