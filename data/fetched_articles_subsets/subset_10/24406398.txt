Adaptor protein c-Abl SH3 domain-binding protein-2 (3BP2) is known to play 
regulatory roles in immunoreceptor-mediated signal transduction. We have 
previously demonstrated that Tyr(174), Tyr(183) and Tyr(446) in mouse 3BP2 are 
predominantly phosphorylated by Syk, and the phosphorylation of Tyr(183) and the 
Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of mouse 3BP2 are critical for B cell receptor 
(BCR)-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in human 
B cells. In this report, we have shown that Syk, but not Abl family 
protein-tyrosine kinases, is critical for BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation 
of 3BP2 in chicken DT40 cells. Mutational analysis showed that Tyr(174), 
Tyr(183) and Tyr(426) of chicken 3BP2 are the major phosphorylation sites by Syk 
and the SH2 domain of 3BP2 is critical for tyrosine phosphorylation. In 
addition, phosphorylation of Tyr(426) is required for the inducible interaction 
with the SH2 domain of Vav3. Moreover, the expression of the mutant form of 3BP2 
in which Tyr(426) was substituted to Phe resulted in the reduction in 
BCR-mediated Rac1 activation, when compared with the case of wild-type. 
Altogether, these data suggest that 3BP2 is involved in the activation of Rac1 
through the regulation of Vav3 by Syk-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr(426) 
following BCR stimulation.
