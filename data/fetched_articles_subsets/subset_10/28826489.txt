The RNA chaperone Hfq is an Sm protein that facilitates base pairing between 
bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) and mRNAs involved in stress response and 
pathogenesis. Hfq possesses an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) 
that may tune the function of the Sm domain in different organisms. In 
Escherichia coli, the Hfq CTD increases kinetic competition between sRNAs and 
recycles Hfq from the sRNA-mRNA duplex. Here, de novo Rosetta modeling and 
competitive binding experiments show that the acidic tip of the E. coli Hfq CTD 
transiently binds the basic Sm core residues necessary for RNA annealing. The 
CTD tip competes against non-specific RNA binding, facilitates dsRNA release, 
and prevents indiscriminate DNA aggregation, suggesting that this acidic peptide 
mimics nucleic acid to auto-regulate RNA binding to the Sm ring. The mechanism 
of CTD auto-inhibition predicts the chaperone function of Hfq in bacterial 
genera and illuminates how Sm proteins may evolve new functions.
