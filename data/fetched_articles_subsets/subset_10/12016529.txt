The rhabdoid predisposition syndrome (RPS) is characterized by pedigrees in 
which two or more individuals carry germline mutations of the hSNF5/INI1 tumor 
suppressor gene. The tumors associated with the syndrome include atypical 
teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT), choroid plexus carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and 
extrarenal rhabdoid tumor. Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK) has not been 
described as part of the RPS. We report a case of a 7-month-old boy with RTK 
whose sister had a malignant cerebellar tumor followed by a malignant lung and 
pleural tumor of childhood with typical rhabdoid histology. Molecular genetic 
analysis of the RTK and tissue from the pleural tumor revealed in both cases 
identical nonsense mutations of the hSNF5/INI1 gene on chromosome 22q11.2, where 
thymidine was substituted for cytosine in base 472. The proband had an identical 
germline mutation. This is the fifth genetically analyzed RPS pedigree and the 
first to include an RTK.
