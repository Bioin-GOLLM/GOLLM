Drug resistance limits the efficacy of targeted therapies, including tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs); however, a substantial portion of the drug resistance 
mechanisms remains unexplained. In this study, we identified LPIN1 as a key 
factor that regulates gefitinib resistance in epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Unlike TKI-sensitive 
HCC827 cells, gefitinib treatment induced LPIN1 expression and increased 
diacylglycerol concentration in TKI-resistant H1650 cells, followed by the 
activation of protein kinase C delta and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in an 
LPIN1-dependent manner, resulting in cancer cell survival. Additionally, LPIN1 
increased the production of lipid droplets, which play an important role in TKI 
drug resistance. All results were recapitulated in a patient-derived EGFR-mutant 
NSCLC cell line. In in vivo tumorigenesis assay, we identified that both 
shRNA-mediated depletion and pharmaceutical inhibition of LPIN1 clearly reduced 
tumor growth and confirmed that gefitinib treatment induced LPIN1 expression and 
LPIN1-dependent NF-κB activation (an increase in p-IκBα level) in tumor tissues. 
These results suggest an effective strategy of co-treating TKIs and LPIN1 
inhibitors to prevent TKI resistance in NSCLC patients.
