sclerosis and type 1 diabetes patients could potentiate effector responses from 
T-cells.

Factors regulating self-antigen directed immune-responses in autoimmunity are 
poorly understood. Signal regulatory protein gamma (SIRPγ) is a human T-cell 
specific protein with genetic variants associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). 
SIRPγ's function in the immune system remains unclear. We show that T1D and 
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subjects have significantly 
greater frequency of rs2281808 T genetic variant, that correlates with reduced 
SIRPγ-expression in T-cells. Importantly, reduced SIRPγ-expression in RRMS and 
T1D subjects was not restricted to T variant, suggesting SIRPγ-expression is 
also regulated by disease specific factors in autoimmunity. Interestingly, 
increased frequencies of SIRPγlow T-cells in RRMS and T1D positively correlated 
with proinflammatory molecules from T-cells. Finally, we show that SIRPγlow 
T-cells have enhanced pathogenecity in vivo in a GVHD model. These findings 
suggest that decreased-SIRPγ expression, either determined by genetic variants 
or through peripherally acquired processes, may have a mechanistic link to 
autoimmunity through induction of hyperactive T-cells.
