BACKGROUND: As the third most common type of cancer in the United States, 
colorectal cancer (CRC) was previously thought to be rare in young populations. 
Despite a decrease in the overall incidence of CRC, the rate of new cases under 
50 years old has been continuously increasing.
AIM: The purpose of our study was to analyze risk factors of young-onset CRC.
METHODS: Commercially available software platform, Explorys, was used to extract 
data from a collective healthcare database electronically.
RESULTS: In this database, 13,800 young adults (age 20-50) were diagnosed with 
primary colorectal malignancy. Compared to subjects with a previous family 
history of CRC who had an odds ratio of 17.78, those diagnosed with primary 
malignant neoplasm of breast and inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis 
and Crohn's) had odds ratios of 16.94, 4.4, and 3.7 for young-onset CRC, 
respectively. Patients with a history of alcohol abuse, smoking, obesity, 
diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia had higher chances of developing 
young-onset CRC. In addition, the odds of CRC were lower in Hispanic ethnicity 
in comparison to Caucasians (OR: 0.54), with no statically significant 
differences between Caucasian, African American, and Asian populations.
CONCLUSION: Currently, this is an expansive study investigating the risk factors 
for early-onset CRC. The analysis showed factors such as family and individual 
history of IBD to have high association with early onset. Notably, an individual 
history of breast malignancy was strongly associated with early-onset CRC.
