Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality in many parts of 
the world. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several 
genetic variants associated with CAD in Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) 
locus. This study was evaluated the possible association of genetic markers at 
LDLR locus with CAD irrespective to lipid profile and as well as the association 
of these SNPs with severity of CAD in Iranian population. Sequencing of 2 exons 
in LDLR gene (Exon 2, 12) and part of intron 30 of SMARCA4 gene include 
rs1122608, was performed in 170 Iranian patients angiographically confirmed CAD 
and 104 healthy controls by direct sequencing. Sullivan's scoring system was 
used for determining the severity of CAD in cases. Our results showed that 
homozygote genotypes of rs1122608 (P<0.0001), rs4300767 (P<0.005) and rs10417578 
(p<0.007) SNPs have strong protective effects on the CAD. In addition, we found 
that rs1122608 (GT or TT) was at higher risk of three vessel involvement 
compared to single vessels affecting (P=0.01).
