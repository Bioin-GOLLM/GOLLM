Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a global health issue affecting a 
significant number of infertile women who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) 
cycles. Extensive vasculogenesis and angiogenesis occur in both maternal and 
fetal placental tissues, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family molecules and their receptors are potent 
angiogenic mediators in the placenta. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in the genes encoding angiogenesis-related factors were selected and 
genotyped in 247 women who had undergone the ART procedure and 120 healthy 
controls. Genotyping was conducted by polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). A variant of the kinase insertion 
domain receptor (KDR) gene (rs2071559) was associated with an increased risk of 
infertility after adjusting for age and BMI (OR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.45-0.91, p = 
0.013 in a log-additive model). Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) 
rs699947 was associated with an increased risk of recurrent implantation 
failures under a dominant (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.11-4.94, padj. = 0.022) and a 
log-additive model (OR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.43-0.99, padj. = 0.038). Variants of the 
KDR gene (rs1870377, rs2071559) in the whole group were in linkage equilibrium 
(D' = 0.25, r2 = 0.025). Gene-gene interaction analysis showed the strongest 
interactions between the KDR gene SNPs rs2071559-rs1870377 (p = 0.004) and KDR 
rs1870377-VEGFA rs699947 (p = 0.030). Our study revealed that the KDR gene 
rs2071559 variant may be associated with infertility and rs699947 VEGFA with an 
increased risk of recurrent implantation failures in infertile ART treated 
Polish women.
