The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in major neutralizing 
antibody-binding sites can affect humoral immunity induced by infection or 
vaccination1-6. Here we analysed the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and 
T cell responses in individuals who were previously infected (recovered) or 
uninfected (naive) and received mRNA vaccines to SARS-CoV-2. While individuals 
who were previously infected sustained higher antibody titres than individuals 
who were uninfected post-vaccination, the latter reached comparable levels of 
neutralization responses to the ancestral strain after the second vaccine dose. 
T cell activation markers measured upon spike or nucleocapsid peptide in vitro 
stimulation showed a progressive increase after vaccination. Comprehensive 
analysis of plasma neutralization using 16 authentic isolates of distinct 
locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants revealed a range of reduction in the 
neutralization capacity associated with specific mutations in the spike gene: 
lineages with E484K and N501Y/T (for example, B.1.351 and P.1) had the greatest 
reduction, followed by lineages with L452R (for example, B.1.617.2). While both 
groups retained neutralization capacity against all variants, plasma from 
individuals who were previously infected and vaccinated displayed overall better 
neutralization capacity than plasma from individuals who were uninfected and 
also received two vaccine doses, pointing to vaccine boosters as a relevant 
future strategy to alleviate the effect of emerging variants on antibody 
neutralizing activity.
