AIMS: To investigate the association of megsin A23167G polymorphism with 
susceptibility and progression of IgA nephropathy in Chinese population.
METHODS: 435 IgA nephropathy patients and their family members were recruited 
for a family-based association study. Genotypes of megsin A23167G were 
determined by direct sequencing. The results were analyzed by transmission 
disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype relative risk (HRR). Clinical data and 
histological scores of renal lesions were compared between patients with 
different genotypes. According to disease stability, IgA nephropathy patients 
were divided into progressive group and stable group. The distribution of 
genotype frequencies were compared between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: TDT revealed that megsin 23167G alleles were transmitted more 
frequently from heterozygous parents to patients than expected (classical TDT: 
chi2 = 5.435, p = 0.020, extended TDT: chi2 = 5.017, p = 0.025). HRR analyses 
showed significant differences between transmitted and nontransmitted allele 
frequencies (chi2 = 7.006, p = 0.008, HRR = 1.762). The scores of glomerular 
index and glomerular sclerosis index were higher in GG genotype patients than 
those in other genotypes (F = 4.570, p = 0.033, F = 4.324, p = 0.038, 
respectively). The distribution frequency of GG genotype in the progressive 
group was higher than that of the stable group (chi2 = 4.370, p = 0.037). No 
statistical difference was found in tubulo-interstitial index, vascular index 
and clinical characteristics between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION: The polymorphism of megsin A23167G is associated with susceptibility 
and progression of IgA nephropathy in Chinese population. GG genotype is 
associated with severe histological lesions and progression of the disease.
