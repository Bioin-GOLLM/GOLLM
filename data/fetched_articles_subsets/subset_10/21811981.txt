OBJECTIVE: To analyze the coding sequence of GJB2 gene in six pedigrees with 
nonsyndromic hearing loss in order to find deafness-causing mutations in the 
GJB2 gene, and to explore the inherent pattern of deafness-causing mutations in 
the GJB2 gene.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood for the probands and 
their family members. Coding sequence of the GJB2 gene was amplified by 
polymerase chain reaction, sequence variations were determined by DNA 
sequencing. Amplified fragments with overlapping peaks on sequencing 
chromatogram were sequenced by TA cloning in order to determine whether the 
mutations originated from the same allele.
RESULTS: Mutations in the GJB2 gene were found in 4 out of the 6 pedigrees with 
nonsyndromic hearing loss. Four types of mutations were detected in the GJB2 
gene, which were 235delC, 299-300delAT, 79G>A+341A>G, and 109G>A. Compound 
heterozygous polymorphisms 79G>A and 341A>G, and mutations 109G>A and 235delC 
had deafness-causing effects.
CONCLUSION: Heterogeneous mutations of the GJB2 gene are frequently seen in 
patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss. Sometimes, polymorphisms may cause 
deafness when they are combined. Environmental factors and other genes may 
contribute to hearing loss caused by the GJB2 gene mutations.
