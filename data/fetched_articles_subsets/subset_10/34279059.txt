OBJECTIVE: Early selection steps preventing autoreactive naive B cell production 
are often impaired in patients with autoimmune diseases, but central and 
peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints have not been assessed in patients with 
systemic sclerosis (SSc). This study was undertaken to characterize early B cell 
tolerance checkpoints in patients with SSc.
METHODS: Using an in vitro polymerase chain reaction-based approach that allows 
the expression of recombinant antibodies cloned from single B cells, we tested 
the reactivity of antibodies expressed by 212 CD19+CD21low CD10+IgMhigh CD27- 
new emigrant/transitional B cells and 190 CD19+CD21+CD10-IgM+CD27- mature naive 
B cells from 10 patients with SSc.
RESULTS: Compared to serum from healthy donors, serum from patients with SSc 
displayed elevated proportions of polyreactive and antinuclear-reactive new 
emigrant/transitional B cells that recognize topoisomerase I, suggesting that 
defective central B cell tolerance contributes to the production of serum 
autoantibodies characteristic of the disease. Frequencies of autoreactive mature 
naive B cells were also significantly increased in SSc patients compared to 
healthy donors, thus indicating that a peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoint 
may be impaired in SSc.
CONCLUSION: Defective counterselection of developing autoreactive naive B cells 
in SSc leads to the production of self antigen-specific B cells that may secrete 
autoantibodies and allow the formation of immune complexes, which promote 
fibrosis in SSc.
