The objective of this study was to explore the role of the aryl hydrocarbon 
receptor (AhR) in ambient particulate matter (PM)-mediated activation of 
dendritic cells (DCs) and Th17-immune responses in vitro. To assess the 
potential role of the AhR in PM-mediated activation of DCs, co-stimulation, and 
cytokine expression, bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages and DCs from C57BL/6 
wildtype or AhR knockout (AhR-/-) mice were treated with PM. Th17 
differentiation was assessed via co-cultures of wildtype or AhR-/- BMDCs with 
autologous naive T cells. PM2.5 significantly induced AhR DNA binding activity 
to dioxin responsive elements (DRE) and expression of the AhR repressor (AhRR), 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1, and CYP1B1, indicating activation of the AhR. In 
activated (OVA sensitized) BMDCs, PM2.5 induced interleukin (IL)-1β, CD80, CD86, 
and MHC class II, suggesting enhanced DC activation, co-stimulation, and antigen 
presentation; responses that were abolished in AhR deficient DCs. DC-T cell 
co-cultures treated with PM and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to elevated IL-17A 
and IL-22 expression at the mRNA level, which is mediated by the AhR. PM-treated 
DCs were essential in endowing T cells with a Th17-phenotype, which was 
associated with enhanced expression of MHC class II and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. 
In conclusion, PM enhances DC activation that primes naive T cell 
differentiation towards a Th17-like phenotype in an AhR-dependent manner.
