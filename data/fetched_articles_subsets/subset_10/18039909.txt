Simmental thrombopathia is an inherited platelet disorder that closely resembles 
the platelet disorders described in Basset Hounds and Eskimo Spitz dogs. 
Recently, two different mutations in the gene encoding calcium diacylglycerol 
guanine nucleotide exchange factor I (CalDAG-GEFI) were described to be 
associated with the Basset Hound and Spitz thrombopathia disorders, and a third 
distinct mutation was identified in CalDAG-GEFI in thrombopathic Landseers of 
European Continental Type. The gene encoding CalDAG-GEFI was sequenced using DNA 
obtained from normal cattle and from a thrombopathic calf studied in Canada. The 
affected calf was found to have a nucleotide change (c.701 T>C), which would 
result in the substitution of a proline for a leucine within structurally 
conserved region two (SCR2) of the catalytic domain of the protein. This change 
is likely responsible for the thrombopathic phenotype observed in Simmental 
cattle and underscores the critical nature of this signal transduction protein 
in platelets.
