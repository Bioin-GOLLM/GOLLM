BACKGROUND: Acral melanoma (AM) is the most common subtype in Chinese melanoma 
patients with a very poor prognosis. However, our understanding of the disease 
pathogenesis and molecular landscape is limited by the few studies that have 
been conducted. Here, we profiled the clinical characteristics, mutational 
landscapes and tumor immune microenvironment of AM patients to gain insights 
into disease characteristics and potential treatment strategies.
METHODS: A total of 90 AM patients were enrolled and their tissue samples were 
subjected to next-generation sequencing and multiplexed immunohistochemistry 
tests. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to analyze the 
prognostic potential of various genetic aberrations and immune cell compositions 
in AM.
RESULTS: The median disease-free survival was 21.3 months and estimated median 
overall survival (OS) was 60 months. More advanced stages, older ages and 
thickness of greater than 4 mm were associated with worse prognosis in AM 
patients (HR = 2.57, 95% CI 1.25-5.29, p = 0.01; HR = 2.77, 95% CI 1.22-6.28, 
p = 0.02; HR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.51-7.82, p < 0.01, respectively), while patients 
who received post-surgical treatments had better survival (HR = 0.36, 95% CI 
0.17-0.76, p = 0.01). The most frequently altered genes included BRAF (14.5%), 
KIT (16.9%), NRAS (12%), NF1 (10.8%), APC (7.2%), and ARID2 (6%). Copy number 
variations (CNV) were commonly found in CCND1 (19.3%), CDK4 (19.3%), MDM2 
(14.5%) and FGF19 (12%). CDK4 amplifications was independently associated with 
shorter OS in AM patients (HR = 3.61, 95% CI 1.38-9.46, p = 0.01). CD8 + T cells 
(p < 0.001) and M1 macrophages (p = 0.05) were more highly enriched in the 
invasive margin than in the tumor center. Patients with higher levels of M1 
macrophage infiltration in the invasive margin derived markedly longer OS 
(HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.95, p = 0.03). Interestingly, in CDK4-amplified 
patients, there tended to be a low level of M1 macrophage infiltration in the 
invasive margin (p = 0.06), which likely explains the poor prognosis in such 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided a comprehensive portrait of the 
clinicopathological features, genetic aberrations and tumor microenvironment 
profiles in AM patients and identified candidate prognostic factors, which may 
facilitate development of additional therapeutic options and better inform 
clinical management of AM patients. Based on these prognostic factors, further 
studies should focus on enhancing the infiltration of M1 macrophages, especially 
in CDK4-amplified AM patients.
