Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is widely used as a flavor enhancer and its effects 
on human health are still debated. We aimed to investigate whether MSG can act 
as alkalinizing agent in murine models and if its metabolites are biomarkers of 
MSG consumption. For this purpose, adult male Wistar rats were given water added 
with 1 g% MSG or three types of control water, including sodium chloride (NaCl) 
and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). At 14 days, urinary pH, electrolytes, urinary 
metabolites and ion-exchanger gene expression were determined. The results 
revealed that MSG-treated rats had significantly more alkaline urine and higher 
levels of urinary sodium and bicarbonate similar to NaHCO3 controls. These 
changes correlated with a lower expression of ion-exchanger genes, namely, CAII, 
NBC1, and AE1, which are involved in bicarbonate kidney reabsorption. The 
urinary metabolic profiles also revealed similar patterns for the MSG and NaHCO3 
groups. In conclusion, MSG exhibits similar properties to NaHCO3, an 
alkalinizing agent, with regard to inducing alkaline urine, reducing bicarbonate 
kidney reabsorption, and generating a specific urinary metabolic pattern. We 
believe that these observations will be useful to further study the MSG effects 
in humans.
