Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be classified as 
tauopathies, which are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that develop toxic 
tau aggregates in specific brain regions. These pathological tau inclusions are 
altered by various post-translational modifications (PTMs) that include 
phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation. Tau methylation has emerged as a 
target of interest for its potential involvement in tau pathomechanisms. 
Filamentous tau aggregates isolated from patients with AD are methylated at 
multiple lysine residues, although the exact methyltransferases have not been 
identified. One strategy to study the site-specific effects of methylation is to 
create methylation mimetics using a KFC model, which replaces lysine (K) with a 
hydrophobic group such as phenylalanine (F) to approximate the effects of lysine 
methylation (C or methyl group). In this study, tau methylmimetics were used to 
model several functional aspects of tau methylation such as effects on 
microtubule binding and tau aggregation in cell models. Overall, several tau 
methylmimetics displayed impaired microtubule binding, and tau methylmimetics 
enhanced prion-like seeded aggregation in the context of the FTD tau mutation 
P301L. Like other PTMs, tau methylation is a contributing factor to tau 
pathogenesis and could be a potential therapeutic drug target for the treatment 
of different tauopathies.
