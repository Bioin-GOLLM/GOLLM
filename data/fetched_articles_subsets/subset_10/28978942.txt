Glaucoma is a chronic disease that shares many similarities with other 
neurodegenerative disorders of the central nervous system. This study was 
designed to evaluate the association between glaucoma and other 
neurodegenerative disorders by investigating glaucoma-associated protein changes 
in the retina and vitreous humour. The multiplexed Tandem Mass Tag based 
proteomics (TMT-MS3) was carried out on retinal tissue and vitreous humour fluid 
collected from glaucoma patients and age-matched controls followed by functional 
pathway and protein network interaction analysis. About 5000 proteins were 
quantified from retinal tissue and vitreous fluid of glaucoma and control eyes. 
Of the differentially regulated proteins, 122 were found linked with 
pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pathway analyses of differentially 
regulated proteins indicate defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation 
machinery. The classical complement pathway associated proteins were activated 
in the glaucoma samples suggesting an innate inflammatory response. The majority 
of common differentially regulated proteins in both tissues were members of 
functional protein networks associated brain changes in AD and other chronic 
degenerative conditions. Identification of previously reported and novel 
pathways in glaucoma that overlap with other CNS neurodegenerative disorders 
promises to provide renewed understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of 
age related neurodegenerative diseases.
