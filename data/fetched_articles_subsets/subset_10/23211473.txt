In pregnancy, uterine spiral artery remodeling is an adaptive morphological 
change at the maternal and fetal interface, which is critical for dilating the 
artery and promoting blood flow to the fetus. Incompletely remodeled spiral 
arteries have been recognized as a common pathological feature in preeclamptic 
patients. To date, the molecular mechanism that controls spiral artery 
remodeling is not well defined. Corin is a transmembrane serine protease 
discovered in the heart, where it converts pro-atrial natriuretic peptide 
(pro-ANP) to active ANP, a cardiac hormone that regulates salt-water balance and 
blood pressure. Recent studies show that corin is up-regulated in the decidua of 
the pregnant uterus, suggesting a potential role of corin in pregnancy. In mice 
lacking corin or ANP, high blood pressure and proteinuria were found at late 
gestational stages. Histological analysis indicated delayed trophoblast invasion 
and impaired spiral artery remodeling in the uterus. In humans, CORIN gene 
mutations were identified in patients with preeclampsia. In this review, we 
discuss the function of corin and ANP in regulating blood pressure and their 
potential role in preeclampsia.
