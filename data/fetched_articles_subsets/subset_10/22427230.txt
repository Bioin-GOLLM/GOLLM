OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether three specific 
interleukin-10 (IL-10) polymorphisms confer susceptibility to psoriasis.
METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the 
IL-10-1082 G/A, -592 C/A polymorphisms and haplotypes of the IL-10-1082 G/A, 
-592 C/A, -819 C/T polymorphisms and psoriasis.
RESULTS: A total of eight studies involving 1,018 psoriasis patients and 1,186 
controls were considered in the meta-analysis. No association was found between 
psoriasis and the IL-10-1082 G allele in all study subjects [odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.098, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.923-1.306, p = 0.291] or between 
this allele and psoriasis in Europeans (OR = 0.990, 95 % CI = 0.809-1.214, 
p = 0.925), but a significant association was found in Asians (OR = 1.785, 95 % 
CI = 1.144-2.76, p = 0.011). Three polymorphisms at the promoter region of IL-10 
(-1082 G/A, -819 C/T, -592 C/A) are known to be in complete linkage 
disequilibrium, but no association was found between the haplotype and 
psoriasis.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that the IL-10-1082 G/A polymorphism 
confers susceptibility to psoriasis in Asians, and suggests that the IL-10 
promoter -1082 polymorphism has an ethnicity-specific effect.
