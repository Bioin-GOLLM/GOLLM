INTRODUCTION: The FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is highly expressed in acute 
leukemias. Mutations involving FLT3 are among the most common molecular 
abnormalities in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Available evidence suggests 
that these molecular lesions confer a shorter disease-free survival and overall 
survival in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Therefore, substantial 
interest in FLT3 as a therapeutic target has led to the development of several 
promising inhibitors that target this tyrosine kinase.
AREAS COVERED: This review covers the molecular pathways associated with FLT3 
activation in patients with AML, the biological rationale for inhibiting FLT3 
and recent clinical progress with FLT3 inhibitors for the treatment of AML. Six 
FLT3 inhibitors undergoing clinical evaluation are discussed. A review of 
selected published manuscripts on the subject of FLT3 inhibition in AML and a 
search of the English language manuscripts in PubMed using the index words FLT3 
and AML were conducted and articles of interest selected.
EXPERT OPINION: Mutated forms of FLT3, specifically FLT3-internal tandem 
duplication, have a significant impact on the prognosis of AML patients, 
particularly those with a normal karyotype. Inhibiting FLT3 may lead to clinical 
benefit for patients with AML. Newly developed FLT3 inhibitors have shown 
encouraging activity as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic 
agents.
