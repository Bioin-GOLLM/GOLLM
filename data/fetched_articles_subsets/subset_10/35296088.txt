Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder associated with multiple sequelae, such as 
psoriatic arthritis and cardiovascular diseases. Increasing evidence has shown 
that γδ T cells, as sources of IL-17A, play critical roles in psoriatic 
inflammations. However, there still lack effective ways to manipulate these 
pathogenic γδ T cells, which are less well studied than αβ T cells. The present 
study aims to characterize the phenotype of γδ T cells and evaluate the impact 
of D-mannose (a C-2 epimer of glucose) on γδ T cell-mediated psoriasis. We found 
that skin-draining LN γδ T cells underwent robust proliferation and acquired an 
IL-17-producing phenotype during psoriasis. The transcriptomic profiles of these 
psoriatic γδ T cells had elevated glycolytic signatures. Importantly, D-mannose 
treatment suppressed the γδ T cell reaction and successfully alleviated the 
local and systematic inflammation induced by imiquimod. The decreased 
AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling and glycolytic ability may contribute to the 
suppression of γδ T cells achieved by D-mannose. Our study increased 
understanding of γδ T cells in psoriasis and promoted D-mannose utilization as a 
potential clinical application for autoimmune diseases driven by γδ T cells.
