Infective L3s (iL3s) of parasitic nematodes share common behavioural, 
morphological and developmental characteristics with the developmentally 
arrested (dauer) larvae of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. It 
is proposed that similar molecular mechanisms regulate entry into or exit from 
the dauer stage in C. elegans, and the transition from free-living to parasitic 
forms of parasitic nematodes. In C. elegans, one of the key factors regulating 
the dauer transition is the insulin-like receptor (designated Ce-DAF-2) encoded 
by the gene Ce-daf-2. However, nothing is known about DAF-2 homologues in most 
parasitic nematodes. Here, using a PCR-based approach, we identified and 
characterised a gene (Hc-daf-2) and its inferred product (Hc-DAF-2) in 
Haemonchus contortus (a socioeconomically important parasitic nematode of 
ruminants). The sequence of Hc-DAF-2 displays significant sequence homology to 
insulin receptors (IR) in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and contains 
conserved structural domains. A sequence encoding an important proteolytic motif 
(RKRR) identified in the predicted peptide sequence of Hc-DAF-2 is consistent 
with that of the human IR, suggesting that it is involved in the formation of 
the IR complex. The Hc-daf-2 gene was transcribed in all life stages of H. 
contortus, with a significant up-regulation in the iL3 compared with other 
stages. To compare patterns of expression between Hc-daf-2 and Ce-daf-2, 
reporter constructs fusing the Ce-daf-2 or Hc-daf-2 promoter to sequence 
encoding GFP were microinjected into the N2 strain of C. elegans, and transgenic 
lines were established and examined. Both genes showed similar patterns of 
expression in amphidial (head) neurons, which relate to sensation and signal 
transduction. Further study by heterologous genetic complementation in a 
daf-2-deficient strain of C. elegans (CB1370) showed partial rescue of function 
by Hc-daf-2. Taken together, these findings provide a first insight into the 
roles of Hc-daf-2/Hc-DAF-2 in the biology and development of H. contortus, 
particularly in the transition to parasitism.
