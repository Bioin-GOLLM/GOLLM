The recognition of G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures as important regulatory 
elements in biological mechanisms, and the connection between G4s and the 
evolvement of different diseases, has sparked interest in developing small 
organic molecules targeting G4s. However, such compounds often lack drug-like 
properties and selectivity. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of a 
novel class of macrocyclic bis-indole quinolines based on their non-macrocyclic 
lead compounds. The effects of the macrocyclization on the ability to interact 
with G4 DNA structures were investigated using biophysical assays and molecular 
dynamic simulations. Overall, this revealed compounds with potent abilities to 
interact with and stabilize G4 structures and a clear selectivity for both G4 
DNA over dsDNA and for parallel/hybrid G4 topologies, which could be attributed 
to the macrocyclic structure. Moreover, we obtained knowledge about the 
structure-activity relationship of importance for the macrocyclic design and how 
structural modifications could be made to construct improved macrocyclic 
compounds. Thus, the macrocyclization of G4 ligands can serve as a basis for the 
optimization of research tools to study G4 biology and potential therapeutics 
targeting G4-related diseases.
