Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, including KPC-producing Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, represent a major threat to public health due to their rapid spread. 
The beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (BL/BLI) combination 
ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) has recently been introduced and shown to 
exhibit excellent activity toward multidrug-resistant KPC-producing 
Enterobacterales strains. However, CAZ-AVI-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates are 
being increasingly reported, mostly corresponding to producers of KPC variants 
that confer resistance to CAZ-AVI but at a cost of carbapenem resistance. We 
have characterized here, both phenotypically and genotypically, a clinical 
CAZ-AVI- and carbapenem-resistant KPC-2 K. pneumoniae isolate co-producing the 
inhibitor-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase VEB-25.
