Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a heritable blistering skin disease 
characterized by separation within the lamina lucida. It is caused by mutations 
in the LAMA3, LAMB3 and LAMC2 genes encoding the α3-, β3- and γ2-chains, 
respectively, of laminin-332. JEB Herlitz type (JEB-H) is a lethal blistering 
disease with severe cutaneous and extracutaneous involvements caused by null 
mutations in the gene encoding laminin-332. Here, we report a proband with JEB-H 
who is a compound heterozygote for two novel mutations in LAMC2; a missense 
mutation (c.79G>A) and an insertion mutation (382insT) leading to a premature 
termination codon.
