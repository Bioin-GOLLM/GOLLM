Mutations in the preproinsulin protein that affect processing of preproinsulin 
to proinsulin or lead to misfolding of proinsulin are associated with diabetes. 
We examined the subcellular localization and secretion of 13 neonatal 
diabetes-associated human proinsulin proteins (A24D, G32R, G32S, L35P, C43G, 
G47V, F48C, G84R, R89C, G90C, C96Y, S101C and Y108C) in rat INS-1 insulinoma 
cells. These mutant proinsulin proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) and are poorly secreted except for G84R and in contrast to wild-type and 
hyperproinsulinemia-associated mutant proteins (H34D and R89H) which were sorted 
to secretory granules and efficiently secreted. We also examined the effect of 
C96Y mutant proinsulin on the synthesis and secretion of wild-type insulin and 
observed a dominant-negative effect of the mutant proinsulin on the synthesis 
and secretion of wild-type insulin due to induction of the unfolded protein 
response and resulting attenuation of overall translation.
