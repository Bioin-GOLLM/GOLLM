OBJECTIVE: To define somatic variants of parathyroid adenoma (PA) and to provide 
novel insights into the underlying molecular mechanism of sporadic PA.
METHODS: Basic clinical characteristics and biochemical indices of 73 patients 
with PA were collected. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on matched 
tumor-constitutional DNA pairs to detect somatic alterations. Functional 
annotation was carried out by ingenuity pathway analysis afterward. The protein 
expression of the variant gene was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and the 
relationship between genotype and phenotype was analyzed.
RESULTS: Somatic variants were identified in 1549 genes, with an average of 69 
variants per tumor (range, 13-2109; total, 9083). Several novel recurrent 
somatic variants were detected, such as KMT2D (15/73), MUC4 (14/73), POTEH 
(13/73), CD22 (12/73), HSPA2 (12/73), HCFC1 (11/73), MAGEA1 (11/73), and SLC4A3 
(11/73), besides the previously reported PA-related genes, including MEN1 
(11/73), CASR (6/73), MTOR (4/73), ASXL3 (3/73), FAT1 (3/73), ZFX (5/73), EZH1 
(2/73), POT1 (2/73), and EZH2 (1/73). Among them, KMT2D might be the candidate 
driver gene of PA. Crucially, 5 patients carried somatic mutations in CDC73, 
showed an aggressive phenotype similar to that of parathyroid carcinoma (PC), 
and had a decreased expression of parafibromin. Pathway analysis of recurrent 
potential PA-associated driver variant genes revealed functional enrichments in 
the signaling pathway of Notch.
CONCLUSION: Our study expanded the pathogenic variant spectrum of PA and 
indicated that KMT2D might be a novel candidate driver gene and be considered as 
a diagnostic biomarker for PA. Meanwhile, CDC73 mutations might be an early 
developmental event from PA to PC. The results provided insights into 
elucidating the pathogenesis of parathyroid tumorigenesis and a certain basis 
for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
