Human O-linked β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (hOGA) is one of the two enzymes 
involved in nuclear and cytoplasmic protein O-GlcNAcylation, an essential 
post-translational modification. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 
GlcNAc-O-(Ser/Thr) glycosidic bonds via anchimeric assistance through the 
2-acetamido group of the GlcNAc sugar. However, the conformational itinerary of 
the GlcNAc ring during catalysis remains unclear. Here we report the crystal 
structure of wild type hOGA in complex with a nonhydrolyzable glycopeptide 
substrate and elucidate the full enzyme catalytic mechanism using QM/MM 
metadynamics. We show that the enzyme can bind the substrate in either a chair- 
or a boat-like conformation, but only the latter is catalytically competent, 
leading to the reaction products via 1,4B/1S3 → [4E]‡ → 4C1 and 4C1 → [4E]‡ → 
1,4B/1S3 conformational itineraries for the first and second catalytic reaction 
steps, respectively. Our results reconcile previous experimental observations 
for human and bacterial OGA and will aid the development of more effective OGA 
inhibitors for diseases associated with impaired O-GlcNAcylation.
