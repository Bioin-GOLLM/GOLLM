Since it has been reported that a single amino acid mutation of Gly-->Arg in the 
CAGYC region of the beta chain of human thyroid stimulating hormone (hTSH) was 
responsible for congenital isolated TSH deficiency, and that the same amino acid 
substitution in this site of hTSH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 
introduced by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in loss of activity, the 
authors studied the role of glutamic acid at position 11 (Glu-11) from the 
N-terminus of the B subunit of cholera toxin (CT), which corresponds to the 
glycine in the CAGYC region of the beta chain of hTSH and hCG. A mutant CT 
constructed by site-directed mutagenesis in which Glu-11 was replaced by Arg 
(CT-E11R) did not induce either morphological changes or accumulation of 
cytosolic cyclic AMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells, although it formed the 
holotoxin AB5, retained the ability to bind to GM1-ganglioside and showed 
ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Weak assembly of the B subunits in mutant 
CT-E11R demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis under non-heating conditions might explain the loss of 
biological activity.
