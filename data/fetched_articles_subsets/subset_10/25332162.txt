Condensin is enriched in the pericentromere of budding yeast chromosomes where 
it is constrained to the spindle axis in metaphase. Pericentric condensin 
contributes to chromatin compaction, resistance to microtubule-based spindle 
forces, and spindle length and variance regulation. Condensin is clustered along 
the spindle axis in a heterogeneous fashion. We demonstrate that pericentric 
enrichment of condensin is mediated by interactions with transfer ribonucleic 
acid (tRNA) genes and their regulatory factors. This recruitment is important 
for generating axial tension on the pericentromere and coordinating movement 
between pericentromeres from different chromosomes. The interaction between 
condensin and tRNA genes in the pericentromere reveals a feature of yeast 
centromeres that has profound implications for the function and evolution of 
mitotic segregation mechanisms.
