BACKGROUND: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) is a 
nuclear hormone receptor. It is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and as 
a receptor for thiazolidinediones, it has drawn attentions towards itself as a 
key molecule to trigger pathways involving in some diseases such as cancers, 
type 2 diabetes, inflammations and osteoporosis. A proline changed to alanine in 
codon 12 of PPAR-γ gene (Pro12Ala) has been known to be responsible for 
decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study is to 
investigate the frequency of Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPAR-γ in healthy Iranian 
population to compare with other populations. Understanding this polymorphism 
may help us in better diagnosis, prevention, and therapeutic approaches toward a 
better management of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis.
METHODS: 128 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. To determine single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we did real time polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR), using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays.
RESULTS: Genotype frequencies for PPAR-γ gene Pro12Ala (rs1801282) polymorphism 
were 0.86 for CC, 0.14 for CG, 0.00 for GG while allelic frequencies were 0.93 
and 0.0.07 for C and G, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There are statistical differences between the distribution of the 
PPAR-γ-2 Pro12Ala polymorphism in other populations and Iranian population.
