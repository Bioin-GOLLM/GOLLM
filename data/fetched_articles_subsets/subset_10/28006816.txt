BACKGROUND: In the Phase III LUX-Lung 3/6 (LL3/LL6) trials in epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma patients, we 
evaluated feasibility of EGFR mutation detection using circulating cell-free DNA 
(cfDNA) and prognostic and predictive utility of cfDNA positivity (cfDNA+).
METHODS: Paired tumour and blood samples were prospectively collected from 
randomised patients. Mutations were detected using cfDNA from serum (LL3) or 
plasma (LL6) by a validated allele-specific quantitative real-time PCR kit.
RESULTS: EGFR mutation detection rates in cfDNA were 28.6% (serum) and 60.5% 
(plasma). Mutation detection in blood was associated with advanced disease 
characteristics, including higher performance score, number of metastatic sites 
and bone/liver metastases, and poorer prognosis. In patients with common EGFR 
mutations, afatinib improved progression-free survival vs chemotherapy in cfDNA+ 
(LL3: HR, 0.35; P=0.0009; LL6: HR, 0.25; P<0.0001) and cfDNA- (LL3: HR, 0.46; 
P<0.0001; LL6: HR, 0.12; P<0.0001) cohorts. A trend towards overall survival 
benefit with afatinib was observed in cfDNA+ patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma cfDNA is a promising alternative to biopsy for EGFR testing. 
Detectable mutation in blood was associated with more advanced disease and 
poorer prognosis. Afatinib improved outcomes in EGFR mutation-positive patients 
regardless of blood mutation status.
