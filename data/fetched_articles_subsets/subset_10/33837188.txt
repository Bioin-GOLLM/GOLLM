Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its reduced form are indispensable 
cofactors in life. Diverse NAD mimics have been developed for applications in 
chemical and biological sciences. Nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (NCD) has 
emerged as a non-natural cofactor to mediate redox transformations, while cells 
are fed with chemically synthesized NCD. Here, we create NCD synthetase (NcdS) 
by reprograming the substrate binding pockets of nicotinic acid mononucleotide 
(NaMN) adenylyltransferase to favor cytidine triphosphate and nicotinamide 
mononucleotide over their regular substrates ATP and NaMN, respectively. 
Overexpression of NcdS alone in the model host Escherichia coli facilitated 
intracellular production of NCD, and higher NCD levels up to 5.0â€‰mM were 
achieved upon further pathway regulation. Finally, the non-natural cofactor 
self-sufficiency was confirmed by mediating an NCD-linked metabolic circuit to 
convert L-malate into D-lactate. NcdS together with NCD-linked enzymes offer 
unique tools and opportunities for intriguing studies in chemical biology and 
synthetic biology.
