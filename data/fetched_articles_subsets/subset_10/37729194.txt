Healthcare-associated infections have become a major health issue worldwide. One 
route of transmission of pathogenic bacteria is through contact with 
"high-touch" dry surfaces, such as handrails. Regular cleaning of surfaces with 
disinfectant chemicals is insufficient against pathogenic bacteria and 
alternative control methods are therefore required. We previously showed that 
warming to human-skin temperature affected the survival of pathogenic bacteria 
on dry surfaces, but humidity was not considered in that study. Here, we 
investigated environmental factors that affect the number of live bacteria on 
dry surfaces in hospitals by principal component analysis of 
previously-collected data (n = 576, for CFU counts), and experimentally verified 
the effect of warming to human-skin temperature on the survival of pathogenic 
bacteria on dry surfaces under humidity control. The results revealed that PCA 
divided hospital dry surfaces into four groups (Group 1~4) and hospital dry 
surfaces at low temperature and low humidity (Group 3) had much higher bacterial 
counts as compared to the others (Group 1 and 4) (p<0.05). Experimentally, 
warming to human-skin temperature (37°C with 90% humidity) for 18~72h 
significantly suppressed the survival of pathogenic bacteria on dry surfaces, 
such as plastic surfaces [p<0.05 vs. 15°C (Escherichia coli DH5α, Staphylococcus 
aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and blaNDM-5 E. coli)] 
or handrails [p<0.05 vs. 15~25°C (E. coli DH5α, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, A. 
baumannii)], under moderate 55% humidity. Furthermore, intermittent heating to 
human-skin temperature reduced the survival of spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus 
subtilis) (p<0.01 vs. continuous heating to human-skin temperature). NhaA, an 
Na+/H+ antiporter, was found to regulate the survival of bacteria on dry 
surfaces, and the inhibitor 2-aminoperimidine enhanced the effect of warming at 
human-skin temperature on the survival of pathogenic bacteria (E. coli DH5α, S. 
aureus, A. baumannii) on dry surfaces. Thus, warming to human-skin temperature 
under moderate humidity is a useful method for impairing live pathogenic 
bacteria on high-touch surfaces, thereby helping to prevent the spread of 
healthcare-associated infections.
