Role of sulfate ester in influencing biologic activity of 
cholecystokinin-related peptides.

Vinayek R, Jensen RT, Gardner JD.

In dispersed acini from guinea pig, mouse, or rat pancreas 
cholecystokinin-(27-33) is a full agonist, and removing the sulfate ester from 
the tyrosine residue in position 27 caused a 100- to 300-fold decrease in 
potency with no change in efficacy. In dispersed acini from mouse or rat 
pancreas, cholecystokinin-(27-32)-NH2 is a partial agonist, and removing the 
sulfate ester from the tyrosine in position 27 abolished the efficacy. The 
desulfated peptide was able, however, to interact with CCK receptors with a 
potency that was threefold less than that of cholecystokinin-(27-32)-NH2 and 
therefore functioned as a cholecystokinin receptor antagonist. In dispersed 
acini from guinea pig pancreas cholecystokinin-(27-32)-NH2 is a cholecystokinin 
receptor antagonist. Removing the sulfate ester from the tyrosine residue in 
position 27 of cholecystokinin(27-32)-NH2 caused a fourfold decrease in potency 
but did not abolish the ability of the peptide to interact with cholecystokinin 
receptors; therefore, desulfated cholecystokinin-(27-32)-NH2 functioned as a 
cholecystokinin receptor antagonist.
