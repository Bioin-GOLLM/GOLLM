Genotypings of two mutations (*2 and *3) in CYP2C19 and the amino acid variants 
(Arg144/Cys, Tyr358/Cys, Ile359/Leu, and Gly417/Asp) in CYP2C9 were carried out 
in 140 unrelated Japanese subjects. Thirty-three subjects (23.6%) were 
genotypically identified as poor metabolizers of CYP2C19, and the allele 
frequencies of the CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 were 0.35 and 0.11, respectively. The 
authors' findings are in agreement with the 18% to 23% prevalence of poor 
metabolizers in the Japanese populations previously phenotyped. In CYP2C9, all 
subjects were homozygous (CYP2C9*1) for Arg144, Tyr358, Ile359, and Gly417, 
except for five subjects (3.6%) who were heterozygous for the Leu359 (CYP2C9*3). 
The frequencies of Arg144, Tyr358, Ile359, Leu359, and Gly417 variants were 1.0, 
1.0, 0.982, 0.018, and 1.0, respectively. The low frequency of the Cys144 allele 
(CYP2C9*2) in the Japanese population is different from the frequency recently 
found in British subjects (allele frequency, 0.125 to 0.192). The results 
suggest that the known interindividual variations in the CYP2C9 sequence among 
Japanese subjects is small, and that Ile359/Leu is one possible site showing 
interracial polymorphism.
