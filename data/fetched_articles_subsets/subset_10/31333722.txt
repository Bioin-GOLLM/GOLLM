DNA methylation of specific genome locations contributes to the distinct 
functions of multicellular organisms. DNA methylation can be governed by 
RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM). RdDM is carried out by endogenous 
small-RNA-guided epigenomic editing complexes that add a methyl group to a 
precise DNA location. In plants, the Argonaute 4 (AGO4) protein is one of the 
main catalytic components involved in RdDM. Although small interfering RNA or 
short hairpin RNA has been shown to be able to guide DNA methylation in human 
cells, AGO protein-regulated RdDM in humans has not yet been evaluated. This 
study aimed to identify a key regulatory AGO protein involved in human RdDM by 
bioinformatics and to explore its function in RdDM by a combination of AGO4 
knockdown, Alu small interfering RNA transfection, AGO4-expressing plasmid 
transfection, chromatin immunoprecipitation, cell-penetrating peptide-tagged 
AGO4 combined Alu single-guide RNA transfection, and methylation analyses. We 
found that first, human AGO4 showed stronger genome-wide association with DNA 
methylation than AGO1-AGO3. Second, endogenous AGO4 depletion demethylated DNA 
of known AGO4 bound loci. Finally, exogenous AGO4 de novo methylated the bound 
DNA sequences. Therefore, we discovered that AGO4 plays a role in human RdDM.
