A comprehensive examination of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is 
fundamental for the understanding of cellular machineries. However, limitations 
in current methodologies often prevent the detection of PPIs with low abundance 
proteins. To overcome this challenge, we develop a mRNA display with library of 
even-distribution (md-LED) method that facilitates the detection of low 
abundance binders with high specificity and sensitivity. As a 
proof-of-principle, we apply md-LED to IAV NS1 protein. Complementary to AP-MS, 
md-LED enables us to validate previously described PPIs as well as to identify 
novel NS1 interactors. We show that interacting with FASN allows NS1 to directly 
regulate the synthesis of cellular fatty acids. We also use md-LED to identify a 
mutant of NS1, D92Y, results in a loss of interaction with CPSF1. The use of 
high-throughput sequencing as the readout for md-LED enables sensitive 
quantification of interactions, ultimately enabling massively parallel 
experimentation for the investigation of PPIs.
