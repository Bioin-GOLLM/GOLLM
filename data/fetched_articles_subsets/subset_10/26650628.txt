Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of 
death among women worldwide. Only 10% of BC cases have been related to genetic 
predisposition. Rad51, a homologous recombination (HR) protein plays an 
important role in HR in meiosis and repairing DNA double-strand breaks. 
Expression of RAD51 may be a predictive biomarker in certain types of cancers. 
The exact mechanisms involved in the regulation of RAD51 expression are not 
fully understood, but certain transcription factors have been suggested to be 
the tuning mechanism of its expression. In this study, we propose that 
polymorphisms in the 5'-UTR promoter region of the RAD51 gene are prognostic 
factors for BC development. Direct sequencing of 106 samples from sporadic BC 
patients and 54 samples from a control group was performed. FFPE samples were 
the choice of sample collection, which might be a limitation of our study. 
Homologous variant T172T alone was found to be significantly associated with BC 
risk (OR 3.717, 95% CI 2.283-6.052, p < 0.0001). On the other hand, heterozygous 
G135C did not show any significant relationship with risk of sporadic BC (OR 
1.598, 95% CI 0.5638-4.528, p > 0.05). Moreover, both variants; homozygous T172T 
and heterozygous G135C together; showed a significant relationship with sporadic 
BC susceptibility.
