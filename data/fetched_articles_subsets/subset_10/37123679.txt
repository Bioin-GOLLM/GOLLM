A variety of cutaneous disorders can present to the general surgeon either 
directly or by referral for surgical intervention. Some conditions are commonly 
seen and operated on by general surgeons which include lipoma, epidermoid cyst, 
etc. On the other hand, some are uncommon conditions like dermatofibrosarcoma 
protuberans and chondroid syringoma which require a high index of suspicion to 
diagnose. Most general surgeons are not familiar with the latest guidelines to 
treat such uncommon conditions. In this article, we provide a review of uncommon 
cutaneous disorders requiring surgical intervention that were encountered at our 
high-volume tertiary care center and a discussion about their etiology, 
presentation, diagnosis, management and follow-up with one case report of each 
condition. The objective of this article is to familiarize the general surgeon 
with these cutaneous disorders which though uncommon, will present in their 
practice at some point.
