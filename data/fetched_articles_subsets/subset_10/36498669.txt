BACKGROUND: There are multiple glucose-lowering drugs available as alternative 
initial monotherapy for type 2 diabetes patients with contraindications or 
intolerance to metformin. However, little comparative and systematic data are 
available for them as initial monotherapy. This study estimated and compared the 
treatment effects of glucose-lowering drugs as initial monotherapy for type 2 
diabetes.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, Chongqing VIP, and WanFang Data 
from 1 January 1990 until 31 December 2020 were searched for randomized 
controlled trials which compared a glucose-lowering drug with 
placebo/lifestyle-intervention for type 2 diabetes. Drug classes included 
metformin, sulfonylureas (SUs), thiazolidinediones (TZDs), glinides (NIDEs), 
Î±-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is), 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), insulins (INSs), and 
glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs).
RESULTS: A total of 185 trials were included, identifying 38,376 patients from 
56 countries across six continents. When choosing an initial drug monotherapy 
alternative to metformin, SUs were most efficacious in reducing HbA1c (-1.39%; 
95% CI -1.63, -1.16) and FPG (-2.70 mmol/L; 95% CI -3.18, -2.23), but increased 
hypoglycemia risks (5.44; 95% CI 2.11, 14.02). GLP-1RAs were most efficacious in 
reducing BMI (-1.05 kg/m2; 95% CI -1.81, -0.29) and TC (-0.42 mmol/L; 95% CI 
-0.61, -0.22). TZDs were most efficacious in increasing HDL-C (0.12 mmol/L; 95% 
CI 0.07, 0.17). SGLT2is were most efficacious in lowering SBP (-4.18 mmHg; 95% 
CI -4.84, -3.53). While AGIs conferred higher risk of AE-induced 
discontinuations (2.57; 95% CI 1.64, 4.03). Overall, only GLP-1RAs showed an 
integrated beneficial effect on all outcomes. Our results also confirmed the 
intraclass differences in treatment effects across drugs. Most trials were 
short-term, and no significant differences in mortality, total vascular events, 
myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or diabetic nephropathy were 
observed across drug classes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a potential treatment hierarchy for 
decision-makers, with GLP-1RAs being the preferred alternative therapy to 
metformin regarding their favorable efficacy and safety profiles.
