Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is a severe, incurable, inherited 
blistering disease caused by COL7A1 mutations. Emerging evidence suggests 
hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) can be reprogrammed into skin; HPC-derived 
cells can restore COL7 expression in COL7-deficient mice. We report two children 
with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa treated with reduced-toxicity 
conditioning and HLA-matched HPC transplantation.
