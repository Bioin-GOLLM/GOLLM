BACKGROUND: Patients' who are positive for kinase domain activating mutations in 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, constitute 30-40% of non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and are suitable candidates for Tyrosine Kinase 
Inhibitor based targeted/personalized therapy. In EGFR non-mutated subset, 8-10% 
that show molecular abnormalities such as EML4-ALK, ROS1-ALK, KIP4-ALK, may also 
derive the benefit of targeted therapy. However, 40% of NSCLC belong to a grey 
zone of tumours that are negative for the clinically approved biomarkers for 
personalized therapy. This pilot study aims to identify and classify molecular 
subtypes of this group to address the un-met need for new drug targets in this 
category. Here we screened for known/novel oncogenic driver mutations using a 46 
gene Ampliseq Panel V1.0 that includes Ser/Thr/Tyr kinases, transcription 
factors and tumor suppressors.
METHODS: NSCLC with tumor burden of at least 40% on histopathology were screened 
for 29 somatic mutations in the EGFR kinase domain by real-time polymerase chain 
reaction methods. 20 cases which were EGFR non-mutated for TK domain mutations 
were included in this study. DNA Quality was verified from each of the 20 cases 
by fluorimeter, pooled and subjected to targeted re-sequencing in the Ion 
Torrent platform. Torrent Suite software was used for next generation sequencing 
raw data processing and variant calling.
RESULTS: The clinical relevance and pathological role of all the 
mutations/variants that include SNPs and Indels was assessed using 
polyphen-2/SIFT/PROVEAN/mutation assessor structure function prediction 
programs. There were 10 pathogenic mutations in six different oncogenes for 
which annotation was available in the COSMIC database; C420R mutation in PIK3CA, 
Q472H mutation in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (KDR), 
C630W and C634R in RET, K367M mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 
(FGFR2), G12C in KRAS and 4 pathogenic mutations in TP53 in the DNA binding 
domain (E285K, R213L, R175H, V173G).
CONCLUSION: Results suggest, a potential role for PIK3CA, VEGFR2, RET and FGFR2 
as therapeutic targets in EGFR non-mutated NSCLC that requires further clinical 
validation.
