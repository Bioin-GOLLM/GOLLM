INTRODUCTION: Growing evidence indicates that variations in the composition of 
the gut microbiota are linked to the onset and progression of chronic 
respiratory diseases (CRDs), albeit the causal relationship between the two 
remains unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) 
analysis to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and five main 
CRDs, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), sarcoidosis, and pneumoconiosis. For MR analysis, the 
inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was utilized as the primary method. The 
MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO statistical methods were used as a 
supplement. To detect heterogeneity and pleiotropy, the Cochrane and Rucker Q 
test, MR-Egger intercept test, and MR-PRESSO global test were then implemented. 
The leave-one-out strategy was also applied to assess the consistency of the MR 
results.
RESULTS: Based on substantial genetic data obtained from genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) comprising 3,504,473 European participants, our study offers 
evidence that several gut microbial taxa, including 14 probable microbial taxa 
(specifically, 5, 3, 2, 3 and 1 for COPD, asthma, IPF, sarcoidosis, and 
pneumoconiosis, respectively) and 33 possible microbial taxa (specifically, 6, 
7, 8, 7 and 5 for COPD, asthma, IPF, sarcoidosis, and pneumoconiosis, 
respectively) play significant roles in the formation of CRDs.
DISCUSSION: This work implies causal relationships between the gut microbiota 
and CRDs, thereby shedding new light on the gut microbiota-mediated prevention 
of CRDs.
