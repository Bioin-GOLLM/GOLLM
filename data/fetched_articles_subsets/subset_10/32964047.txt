OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence highlights the significance of microRNAs (miRNAs) 
in the progression of atherosclerosis (AS). Our aim was to probe out the role 
and regulatory mechanism of miR-29a-3p in AS.
METHODS: An in vivo model of AS was conducted by high-fat diet ApoE-/- mice. 
Oxidized low-density lipoprotein- (ox-LDL-) exposed vascular smooth muscle cells 
(VSMCs) were utilized as an in vitro of AS. Serum levels of total cholesterol 
(TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were detected. Hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) and Masson's staining was presented to investigate the pathological 
changes. miR-29a-3p and TNFRSF1A expression was detected by RT-qPCR. 
Proliferative, migrated, and invaded abilities of VSMCs were determined via a 
series of assays. The interaction between miR-29a-3p and TNFRSF1A was verified 
through luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: Upregulated miR-29a-3p and downregulated TNFRSF1A were found both in 
vitro and in vivo models of AS. miR-29a-3p mimic distinctly decreased the serum 
levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C and increased serum HDL-C levels. Moreover, its 
overexpression could ameliorate plaque formation of AS mice. In ox-LDL-induced 
VSMCs, miR-29a-3p overexpression notably decreased cell proliferation, 
migration, and invasion, which was reversed by TNFRSF1A overexpression. Also, 
miR-29a-3p could directly target the 3'UTR of TNFRSF1A.
CONCLUSION: miR-29a-3p overexpression ameliorated plaque formation of AS and 
suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of ox-LDL-induced VSMCs via 
TNFRSF1A, which offered novel insights into the progression of AS.
