Mutations in the PINK1 gene have been shown to cause autosomal recessive 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and/or early onset sporadic PD in Italy, Spain, North 
America, Ireland, and Asia. However, there are limited data on PINK1 mutations 
in sporadic early onset Asian PD patients. To determine the prevalence of PINK1 
mutation in Taiwanese population, we conducted genetic analysis of PINK1 
mutation in 73 early onset sporadic PD and 94 normal control subjects. We only 
identified a novel single heterozygous mutation R 407Q mutation in exon 6 of 
this gene in one patient at the age onset of 54. Overall, these data indicate 
that PINK1 mutations are rare in our population. Based on our results, unless 
common mutational hotspots are identified, routine testing for this mutation at 
least in our population may not be cost-effective.
