BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mutations in the SACS gene are commonly associated with 
autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS), a complex 
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the 
cerebellum and spinal cord tracts. The aim of this study was to identify the 
genetic cause of the disease in an Italian family with spastic paraplegia and 
peripheral neuropathy.
METHODS: Affected subjects were subjected to a comprehensive neurological 
examination including electromyography and brain magnetic resonance imaging. 
Genetic studies included exclusion of known disease genes, genome-wide linkage 
analysis using high density single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and 
candidate gene sequencing.
RESULTS: Molecular analyses revealed a novel missense mutation in the SACS gene 
(c.11,104A>G) occurring in a homozygous state in patients and absent in 700 
Italian control chromosomes. The mutation led to the amino acid substitution 
p.Thr3702Ala in the sacsin protein, in a possible protein-protein interaction 
site of UBE3A binding domain.
CONCLUSION: This study broadens the genetic spectrum of SACS mutations and 
expands the clinical ARSACS phenotype suggesting that the SACS gene can be 
considered in patients with non-canonical ARSACS clinical presentations.
