The non-contractile cytoskeleton in cardiomyocytes is comprised of cytoplasmic 
actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. In addition to providing 
mechanical support to these cells, these structures are important effectors of 
tension-sensing and signal transduction and also provide networks for the 
transport of proteins and organelles. The majority of our knowledge on the 
function and structure of these cytoskeletal networks comes from research on 
proliferative cell types. However, in recent years, researchers have begun to 
show that there are important cardiomyocyte-specific functions of the 
cytoskeleton. Here we will discuss the current state of cytoskeletal biology in 
cardiomyocytes, as well as research from other cell types, that together suggest 
there is a wealth of knowledge on cardiac health and disease waiting to be 
uncovered through exploration of the complex signaling networks of cardiomyocyte 
non-sarcomeric cytoskeletal proteins.
