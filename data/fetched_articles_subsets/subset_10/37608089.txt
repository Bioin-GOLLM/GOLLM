BACKGROUND: In-utero hyperglycemia exposure influences later cardiometabolic 
risk, although few studies include women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
or assess maternal body mass index (BMI) as a potential confounder.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of maternal T2D and gestational diabetes 
mellitus (GDM) with childhood anthropometry, and the influence of maternal BMI 
on these associations.
METHODS: The PANDORA cohort comprises women (n = 1138) and children (n = 1163). 
Women with GDM and T2D were recruited from a hyperglycemia in pregnancy 
register, and women with normoglycemia from the community. Wave 1 follow-up 
included 423 children, aged 1.5-5 years (median follow-up age 2.5 years). 
Multivariable linear regression assessed associations between maternal antenatal 
variables, including BMI and glycemic status, with offspring anthropometry 
(weight, height, BMI, skinfold thicknesses, waist, arm and head circumferences).
RESULTS: Greater maternal antenatal BMI was associated with increased 
anthropometric measures in offspring independent of maternal glycemic status. 
After adjustment, including for maternal BMI, children exposed to maternal GDM 
had lower mean weight (-0.54 kg, 95% CI: -0.99, -0.11), BMI (-0.55 kg/m2, 95% 
CI: -0.91, -0.20), head (-0.52 cm, 95% CI: -0.88, -0.16) and mid-upper arm 
(-0.32 cm, 95% CI: -0.63, -0.01) circumferences, and greater mean suprailiac 
skinfold (0.78 mm, 95% CI: 0.13, 1.43), compared to children exposed to 
normoglycemia. Adjustment for maternal BMI strengthened the negative association 
between GDM and child weight, BMI and circumferences. Children exposed to 
maternal T2D had smaller mean head circumference (-0.82 cm, 95% CI: -1.33, 
-0.31) than children exposed to normoglycemia. Maternal T2D was no longer 
associated with greater child mean skinfolds (p = 0.14) or waist circumference 
(p = 0.18) after adjustment for maternal BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Children exposed to GDM had greater suprailiac skinfold thickness 
than unexposed children, despite having lower mean weight, BMI and mid-upper arm 
circumference, and both GDM and T2D were associated with smaller mean head 
circumference. Future research should assess whether childhood anthropometric 
differences influence lifetime cardiometabolic and neurodevelopmental risk.
