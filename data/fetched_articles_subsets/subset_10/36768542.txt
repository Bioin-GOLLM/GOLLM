Neural tube defects (NTDs) are complex congenital malformations resulting from 
failure of neural tube closure during embryogenesis, which is affected by the 
interaction of genetic and environmental factors. It is well known that folate 
deficiency increases the incidence of NTDs; however, the underlying mechanism 
remains unclear. Folate deficiency not only causes DNA hypomethylation, but also 
blocks the synthesis of 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (dTMP) and increases 
uracil misincorporation, resulting in genomic instabilities such as base 
mismatch, DNA breakage, and even chromosome aberration. DNA repair pathways are 
essential for ensuring normal DNA synthesis, genomic stability and integrity 
during embryonic neural development. Genomic instability or lack of DNA repair 
has been implicated in risk of development of NTDs. Here, we reviewed the 
relationship between folate deficiency, DNA repair pathways and NTDs so as to 
reveal the role and significance of DNA repair system in the pathogenesis of 
NTDs and better understand the pathogenesis of NTDs.
