BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine 
tumor of the skin. It is associated with advanced age, ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation, and Merkel cell polyomavirus. It has a predilection for the lymphatic 
system, but rarely spreads to the central nervous system.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old Caucasian man with a history of rheumatoid 
arthritis and MCC of the right lower eyelid and cheek presented with left-sided 
hemineglect and word-finding difficulty. Twenty months earlier he had undergone 
local excision of a 3 cm lesion with negative margins, negative sentinel lymph 
node biopsy, and external beam radiation. On presentation he was found to have a 
6.3 cm mass in the right frontotemporal region. He underwent prompt resection, 
with pathological analysis consistent with metastatic MCC. He subsequently 
underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and adjunctive immunotherapy with 
pembrolizumab. He has since tolerated the therapy well and is currently without 
neurological symptoms or evidence of recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral metastasis of MCC is a rare event and should be considered 
when a patient with a history of MCC presents with neurological symptoms. 
Optimal treatment regimens of these rare cases are unclear; however, prompt 
resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, and adjunctive immunotherapy have shown an 
initial positive response in this patient.
