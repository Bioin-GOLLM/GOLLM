Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) carry molecular information from their 
source cells and are desired biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. We establish a 
machine learning-assisted dual-marker detection method to analyze the expression 
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 
(CXCR4) in serum sEVs for the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We find that the serum sEV EGFR and CXCR4 are 
significantly higher in advanced stage NSCLC (A/NSCLC) patients compared to 
early stage NSCLC (E/NSCLC) patients and the healthy donors (HDs). A receiver 
operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis demonstrates that the combination 
of EGFR and CXCR4 in serum sEVs as an efficient diagnostic index and malignant 
degree indicator for NSCLC. Machine learning further shows a diagnostic accuracy 
of 97.4% for the training cohort and 91.7% for the validation cohort based on 
the combinational marker. Moreover, this machine leaning-assisted serum sEV 
analysis successfully predicts the possibility of tumor relapse in three NSCLC 
patients by comparing their serum sEVs before and three days after surgery. This 
study provides an intelligent serum sEV-based assay for the diagnosis and 
prognosis prediction of NSCLC, and will benefit the precision management of 
NSCLC.
