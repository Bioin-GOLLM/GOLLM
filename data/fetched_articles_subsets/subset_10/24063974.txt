Hypoglycemia produces complex neural and hormonal responses that restore glucose 
levels to normal. Glucose, metabolic substrates and their transporters, 
neuropeptides and neurotransmitters alter the firing rate of glucose-sensing 
neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH); these monitor energy status and 
regulate the release of neurotransmitters that instigate a suitable 
counter-regulatory response. Under normal physiological conditions, these 
mechanisms maintain blood glucose concentrations within narrow margins. However, 
antecedent hypoglycemia and diabetes can lead to adaptations within the brain 
that impair counter-regulatory responses. Clearly, the mechanisms employed to 
detect and regulate the response to hypoglycemia, and the pathophysiology of 
defective counter-regulation in diabetes, are complex and need to be elucidated 
to permit the development of therapies that prevent or reduce the risk of 
hypoglycemia.
