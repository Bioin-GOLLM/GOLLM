Major causes of chronic kidney disease are primary proliferative and 
nonproliferative glomerulonephritides (PGN and NPGN). However, the pathogenesis 
of PGN and NPGN is still not fully understood. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated 
antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a T-cell membrane receptor that plays a key role in T-cell 
inhibition. Despite its role in autoimmunological diseases, little is known 
about the involvement of CTLA-4 in the pathogenesis of PGN and NPGN. The 
objective of this study was to determine the role of CTLA-4 in the pathogenesis 
of PGN and NPGN by evaluating the frequencies of T and B lymphocytes expressing 
CTLA-4 and the serum concentration of the sCTLA-4 isoform in patients with PGN 
and NPGN in relation to clinical parameters. The study included peripheral blood 
(PB) samples from 40 PGN and NPGN patients and 20 healthy age- and sex-matched 
volunteers (control group). The viable PB lymphocytes were labeled with 
fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and analyzed using 
flow cytometry. The serum concentration of sCTLA-4 was measured using ELISA. The 
frequencies and absolute counts of CD4+/CTLA-4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+/CTLA-4+ T 
lymphocytes and CD19+/CTLA-4+ B lymphocytes and the serum sCTLA-4 concentration 
were lower in PGN and NPGN patients that in the control group. Reduced sCTLA-4 
expression was associated with a lower concentration of serum immunoglobulins. 
Our results indicate that deregulation of CTLA-4 expression may result in 
continuous activation of T cells and contribute to the pathogenesis of PGN and 
NPGN.
