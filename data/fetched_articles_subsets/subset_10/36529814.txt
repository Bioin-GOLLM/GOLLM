BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and a 
leading cause of death among women worldwide. Early BC is potentially curable, 
but the mortality rates still observed among BC patients demonstrate the urgent 
need of novel and more effective diagnostic and therapeutic options. Limitless 
self-renewal is a hallmark of cancer, governed by telomere maintenance. In 
around 95% of BC cases, this process is achieved by telomerase reactivation 
through upregulation of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). The 
hypermethylation of a specific region within the hTERT promoter, termed TERT 
hypermethylated oncological region (THOR) has been associated with increased 
hTERT expression in cancer. However, its biological role and clinical potential 
in BC have never been studied to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, we aimed 
to investigate the role of THOR as a biomarker and explore the functional impact 
of THOR methylation status in hTERT upregulation in BC.
RESULTS: THOR methylation status in BC was assessed by pyrosequencing on 
discovery and validation cohorts. We found that THOR is significantly 
hypermethylated in malignant breast tissue when compared to benign tissue 
(40.23% vs. 12.81%, P < 0.0001), differentiating malignant tumor from normal 
tissue from the earliest stage of disease. Using a reporter assay, the addition 
of unmethylated THOR significantly reduced luciferase activity by an average 
1.8-fold when compared to the hTERT core promoter alone (P < 0.01). To further 
investigate its biological impact on hTERT transcription, targeted THOR 
demethylation was performed using novel technology based on CRISPR-dCas9 system 
and significant THOR demethylation was achieved. Cells previously demethylated 
on THOR region did not develop a histologic cancer phenotype in in vivo assays. 
Additional studies are required to validate these observations and to unravel 
the causality between THOR hypermethylation and hTERT upregulation in BC.
CONCLUSIONS: THOR hypermethylation is an important epigenetic mark in breast 
tumorigenesis, representing a promising biomarker and therapeutic target in BC. 
We revealed that THOR acts as a repressive regulatory element of hTERT and that 
its hypermethylation is a relevant mechanism for hTERT upregulation in BC.
