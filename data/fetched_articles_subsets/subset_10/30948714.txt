Phox homology (PX) domains are membrane interacting domains that bind to 
phosphatidylinositol phospholipids or phosphoinositides, markers of organelle 
identity in the endocytic system. Although many PX domains bind the canonical 
endosome-enriched lipid PtdIns3P, others interact with alternative 
phosphoinositides, and a precise understanding of how these specificities arise 
has remained elusive. Here we systematically screen all human PX domains for 
their phospholipid preferences using liposome binding assays, biolayer 
interferometry and isothermal titration calorimetry. These analyses define four 
distinct classes of human PX domains that either bind specifically to PtdIns3P, 
non-specifically to various di- and tri-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, bind 
both PtdIns3P and other phosphoinositides, or associate with none of the lipids 
tested. A comprehensive evaluation of PX domain structures reveals two distinct 
binding sites that explain these specificities, providing a basis for defining 
and predicting the functional membrane interactions of the entire PX domain 
protein family.
