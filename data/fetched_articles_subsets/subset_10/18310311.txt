BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine whether four expression-related cytokine 
polymorphisms are associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
METHODS: DNA from 478 cases with AMD and 555 normal controls was genotyped for 
the pro-inflammatory IL1beta -511C/T, IL6 -174C/G, IL8 -251A/T and 
anti-inflammatory IL10 -1082G/A cytokine polymorphisms using the 5' nuclease 
TaqMan(R) assay for allelic discrimination. Associations with AMD were analysed 
using allelic frequencies.
RESULTS: The -251A allele of the IL8 promoter gene polymorphism was more 
prevalent in AMD patients than controls (p = 0.037, OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.01 to 
1.44). Adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), current smoking and past 
smoking status did not alter the AMD association significantly (corrected p 
value = 0.043, OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.50).
CONCLUSION: The pro-inflammatory homozygous IL8 -251AA genotype is an important 
risk factor for AMD. This may have implications for future therapy with 
biological agents that could target this cytokine.
