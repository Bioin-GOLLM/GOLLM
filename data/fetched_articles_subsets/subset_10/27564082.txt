BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of biologics for psoriasis shows heterogeneity 
among patients. With pharmacogenetic markers, it might be possible to predict 
treatment response.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the association between genetic markers and the 
response to biologics in psoriasis (etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab) in a 
prospective cohort.
METHODS: We investigated the copy number variation in the LCE3B and LCE3C genes, 
and eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HLA-C*06, CD84, IL12B, 
IL23R, TRAF3IP2, ERAP1, IFIH1 and TNFAIP3. The decrease in Psoriasis Area and 
Severity Index (PASI) was calculated as ∆PASI (absolute PASI decrease compared 
with baseline) and PASI 75 (proportion of patients with ≥ 75% improvement vs. 
baseline). Associations between genetic variants and treatment outcome were 
assessed using multivariable linear regression analysis (∆PASI corrected for 
baseline PASI, primary analysis) and Pearson's χ2 -test or Fisher's exact test 
(PASI 75, secondary analysis).
RESULTS: We included 348 treatment episodes in 234 patients. Patients 
heterozygous (GA) for the SNP in CD84 (rs6427528) had a better ∆PASI response to 
etanercept after 3 months (P = 0·025) than the homozygous reference group (GG). 
In addition, patients heterozygous (CT) for the IL12B variant showed a better 
response (∆PASI) to ustekinumab (P = 0·017) than the reference group (CC). 
Patients homozygous (GG) for the SNP in TNFAIP3 showed a worse response (∆PASI) 
to ustekinumab (P = 0·031) than the reference group (TT). The associations with 
ustekinumab resulting from the primary analysis were not confirmed in the 
secondary (PASI 75) analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a strong association between etanercept use in 
psoriasis and variations in CD84, a gene that was previously found to be a 
predictor of response to etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis.
