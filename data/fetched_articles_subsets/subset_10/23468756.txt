The Sn(IV) cation in the title compound, [Sn(CH3)2(C10H8NO)2], is N,O-chelated 
by two 2-methyl-quinolin-8-olate anions and coordinated by two methyl groups in 
a skew-trapezoidal bipyramidal geometry. In the mol-ecule, the two quinoline 
ring systems are twisted to one another at 10.91 (18)°. The dimethyl-tin 
skeleton [C-Sn-C = 149.6 (2)°] is bent over the longer edge of the trapezoid 
that is defined by the four chelating atoms. Weak inter-molecular C-H⋯O hydrogen 
bonding occurs in the crystal.
