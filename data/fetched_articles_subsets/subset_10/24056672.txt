BACKGROUND: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection is a common contributor 
to pulmonary symptoms in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Here we examined 
RSV infection in immortalized bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE41o-) expressing 
wild-type (wt) or F508del cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR), for monolayer integrity and RSV replication.
METHODS: CFBE41o- monolayers expressing wt or F508del CFTR were grown on 
permeable supports and inoculated with RSV A2 strain. Control experiments 
utilized UV-inactivated RSV and heat-killed RSV. Monolayer resistance and RSV 
production was monitored for up to six days post-infection.
RESULTS: Within 24 h, a progressive decrease in monolayer resistance was 
observed in RSV infected F508del CFBE41o- cells, while the monolayer integrity 
of RSV infected wt CFTR CFBE41o- cells remained stable. RSV replication was 
necessary to disrupt F508del CFBE41o- monolayers as UV-irradiated and heat 
killed RSV had no effect on monolayer integrity, with an earlier and much more 
pronounced peak in RSV titer noted in F508del relative to wt CFTR-expressing 
cells. RSV infection of wt CFBE41o- monolayers also resulted in blunting of CFTR 
response.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify an enhanced sensitivity of CFBE41o- cells 
expressing F508del CFTR to RSV infection, replication and monolayer disruption 
independent of the cellular immune response, and provide a novel mechanism by 
which cystic fibrosis airway epithelia are susceptible to RSV-dependent injury.
