Recessive hereditary methemoglobinemia (RHM) due to NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 
deficiency is a rare disease caused by pathogenic variants in CYB5R3. Unlike 
type I, in RHM type II (RHM2), the enzymatic defect affects erythrocytes and all 
body tissues, thus resulting in cyanosis and neurological impairment. Although 
the first description of RHM2 dates back to the mid-1950s, detailed clinical and 
neuroimaging information are available for only a few patients. Here, we 
describe a new patient with RHM2 that harbors an unreported homozygous 31 Kb 
deletion involving part of CYB5R3, and showing a peculiar neuroimaging pattern 
resembling a ponto-cerebellar hypoplasia-like condition. A careful review of the 
available literature was performed with the aim of better delineating 
neurological and neuroimaging as well as the genotypic spectra of this extremely 
rare disease.
