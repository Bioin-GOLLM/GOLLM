Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) is a rare autosomal dominant disease classically 
associated with fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, 
and renal cancers. Information about its manifestation aside from the ones 
listed prior is limited. There have been several reports of BHD associated with 
parotid oncocytomas and rare benign epithelial tumors. Here, we report the first 
known case of BHD in association with parotid acinic cell carcinoma, a rare 
low-grade malignant tumor of salivary glands.
