A therapy for COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 19) caused by Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains elusive due to the lack 
of an effective antiviral therapeutic molecule. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease 
(Mpro), which plays a vital role in the viral life cycle, is one of the most 
studied and validated drug targets. In Several prior studies, numerous possible 
chemical entities were proposed as potential Mpro inhibitors; however, most 
failed at various stages of drug discovery. Repositioning of existing antiviral 
compounds accelerates the discovery and development of potent therapeutic 
molecules. Hence, this study examines the applicability of anti-dengue compounds 
against the substrate binding site of Mpro for disrupting its polyprotein 
processing mechanism. An in-silico structure-based virtual screening approach is 
applied to screen 330 experimentally validated anti-dengue compounds to 
determine their affinity to the substrate binding site of Mpro. This study 
identified the top five compounds (CHEMBL1940602, CHEMBL2036486, CHEMBL3628485, 
CHEMBL200972, CHEMBL2036488) that showed a high affinity to Mpro with a docking 
score > -10.0 kcal/mol. The best-docked pose of these compounds with Mpro was 
subjected to 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation followed by MM/GBSA 
binding energy. This showed the maximum stability and comparable ΔG binding 
energy against the reference compound (X77 inhibitor). Overall, we repurposed 
the reported anti-dengue compounds against SARS-CoV-2-Mpro to impede its 
polyprotein processing for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection.
