BACKGROUND: Animal-free recombinant proteins provide a safe and effective 
alternative to tissue or serum-derived products for both therapeutic and 
biomanufacturing applications. While recombinant insulin and albumin already 
exist to replace their human counterparts in cell culture media, until recently 
there has been no equivalent for serum transferrin.
RESULTS: The first microbial system for the high-level secretion of a 
recombinant transferrin (rTf) has been developed from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
strains originally engineered for the commercial production of recombinant human 
albumin (Novozymes' Recombumin® USP-NF) and albumin fusion proteins (Novozymes' 
albufuse®). A full-length non-N-linked glycosylated rTf was secreted at levels 
around ten-fold higher than from commonly used laboratory strains. Modification 
of the yeast 2 μm-based expression vector to allow overexpression of the ER 
chaperone, protein disulphide isomerase, further increased the secretion of rTf 
approximately twelve-fold in high cell density fermentation. The rTf produced 
was functionally equivalent to plasma-derived transferrin.
CONCLUSIONS: A Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system has enabled the cGMP 
manufacture of an animal-free rTf for industrial cell culture application 
without the risk of prion and viral contamination, and provides a high-quality 
platform for the development of transferrin-based therapeutics.
