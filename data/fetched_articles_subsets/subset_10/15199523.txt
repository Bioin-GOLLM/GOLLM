Microcephalin (MCPH1) is a gene mutated in primary microcephaly, an autosomal 
recessive neurodevelopmental disorder in which there is a marked reduction in 
brain size. PCC syndrome is a recently described disorder of microcephaly, short 
stature, and misregulated chromosome condensation. Here, we report the finding 
that MCPH1 primary microcephaly and PCC syndrome are allelic disorders, both 
having mutations in the MCPH1 gene. The two conditions share a common cellular 
phenotype of premature chromosome condensation in the early G2 phase of the cell 
cycle, which, therefore, appears to be a useful diagnostic marker for 
individuals with MCPH1 gene mutations. We demonstrate that an siRNA-mediated 
depletion of MCPH1 is sufficient to reproduce this phenotype and also show that 
MCPH1-deficient cells exhibit delayed decondensation postmitosis. These findings 
implicate microcephalin as a novel regulator of chromosome condensation and link 
the apparently disparate fields of neurogenesis and chromosome biology. Further 
characterization of MCPH1 is thus likely to lead to fundamental insights into 
both the regulation of chromosome condensation and neurodevelopment.
