Dysregulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in endothelial cells 
(ECs) is implicated in vascular diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH). Here, we showed that the transcription factor ATOH8 was a direct target 
of SMAD1/5 and was induced in a manner dependent on BMP but independent of 
Notch, another critical signaling pathway in ECs. In zebrafish and mice, 
inactivation of Atoh8 did not cause an arteriovenous malformation-like 
phenotype, which may arise because of dysregulated Notch signaling. In contrast, 
Atoh8-deficient mice exhibited a phenotype mimicking PAH, which included 
increased pulmonary arterial pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy. 
Moreover, ATOH8 expression was decreased in PAH patient lungs. We showed that in 
cells, ATOH8 interacted with hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) and decreased 
its abundance, leading to reduced induction of HIF-2α target genes in response 
to hypoxia. Together, these findings suggest that the BMP receptor type 
II/ALK-1/SMAD/ATOH8 axis may attenuate hypoxic responses in ECs in the pulmonary 
circulation and may help prevent the development of PAH.
