Macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) mediates the endocytosis of modified 
low-density lipoproteins and plays an important antiviral role. However, the 
molecular mechanism underlying MSR1 antiviral actions remains elusive. We report 
that MSR1 activates autophagy to restrict infection of Chikungunya virus 
(CHIKV), an arthritogenic alphavirus that causes acute and chronic crippling 
arthralgia. Msr1 expression was rapidly upregulated after CHIKV infection in 
mice. Msr1 knockout mice had elevated viral loads and increased susceptibility 
to CHIKV arthritis along with a normal type I IFN response. Induction of LC3 
lipidation by CHIKV, a marker of autophagy, was reduced in Msr1-/- cells. 
Mechanistically, MSR1 interacted with ATG12 through its cytoplasmic tail and 
this interaction was enhanced by CHIKV nsP1 protein. MSR1 repressed CHIKV 
replication through ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L1 and this was dependent on the 
FIP200-and-WIPI2-binding domain, but not the WD40 domain of ATG16L1. Our results 
elucidate an antiviral role for MSR1 involving the autophagic function of 
ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L1.
