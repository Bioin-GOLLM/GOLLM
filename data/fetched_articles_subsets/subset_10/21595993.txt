Scrapie is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder of sheep and goats caused by 
post-translational conformational change in the host-encoded prion protein 
(PrPC). Susceptibility or resistance to scrapie has been associated with the 
presence of polymorphisms in the prion protein (PrP) gene. In the present study, 
we analyzed the PrP gene sequence to determine the frequency of polymorphisms in 
56 sheep (28 each from Damani and Hashtnagri breeds) and 56 goats (28 each from 
Kamori and Local Hairy breeds). A total of 7 amino acid polymorphisms were 
detected in the PrP gene for sheep and 4 for goats. These amino acid 
polymorphisms were combined in 13 alleles and 15 genotypes in sheep and 5 
alleles and 6 genotypes in goats. The overall frequency of the most sheep 
scrapie-resistant polymorphism (Q171R) was calculated to be 0.107. The most 
scrapie-susceptible polymorphism (A136V) was not detected in any of the studied 
sheep. The overall frequency of scrapie-associated polymorphism (H143R) in goats 
was found to be 0.152. Along with already known amino acid polymorphisms, two 
novel polymorphisms were also detected for each of sheep (Q171N and T191I) and 
goats (G22C and P63L). However, the overall frequency of these polymorphisms was 
extremely low.
