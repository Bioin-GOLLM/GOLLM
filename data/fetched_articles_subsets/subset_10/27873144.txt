Missense variants of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes pose a problem in clinical 
genetics as long as they cannot unambiguously be assigned as the cause of Lynch 
syndrome (LS). To study such variants of uncertain clinical significance, we 
have developed a functional assay based on direct measurement of MMR activity in 
mouse embryonic stem cells expressing mutant protein from the endogenous 
alleles. We have applied this protocol to a specific truncation mutant of MSH2 
that removes 60 C-terminal amino acids and has been found in suspected LS 
families. We show that the stability of the MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer is severely 
perturbed, causing attenuated MMR in in vitro assays and cancer predisposition 
in mice. This mutation can therefore unambiguously be considered as deleterious 
and causative for LS.
