INTRODUCTION: Identification of persons living with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-associated tuberculosis (TB) at increased risk for unfavourable TB 
outcomes would inform efforts to improve such outcomes. We sought to identify 
factors associated with a decreased risk of unfavourable TB treatment outcomes 
among people living with HIV-infection (PLHIV) in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMIC), with a specific focus on directly observed therapy (DOT) 
compared with self-administered therapy (SAT) during the continuation phase of 
anti-TB therapy.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adults diagnosed with 
HIV-associated TB in Africa, Asia and the Americas from 2012 to 2013; data were 
collected from 2012 to 2016. Unfavourable TB treatment outcomes (death during TB 
treatment, and TB treatment failure or recurrence) were defined according to 
World Health Organization criteria. Receipt of DOT was obtained at the site 
level and defined as ≥5 days of DOT per week. The person administering DOT and 
treatment location varied by site. Lack of receipt of DOT was defined as SAT. 
Multivariable logistic regression estimated the adjusted odds of unfavourable TB 
treatment outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 1862 adults with HIV-associated TB included, 252 (13.5%) had 
unfavourable TB outcomes (226 deaths, 26 recurrences/failures). Overall, 1825 
(98%) received DOT in the intensive phase and 1617 (87%) received DOT in the 
continuation phase. DOT in the continuation phase was not significantly 
associated with unfavourable TB outcomes (aOR 1.43, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.38) 
compared to SAT. Body mass index (BMI) change during anti-TB treatment (per 2 
units increase, aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.82) and CD4+ count at TB diagnosis 
(200 vs. 50  cells/µL, aOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73) were both independently 
associated with decreased odds of unfavourable TB treatment outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large, international cohort of people living with 
HIV-associated TB in LMIC who received intensive phase DOT, DOT during the 
continuation phase of anti-TB therapy was not associated with a decreased odds 
of unfavourable TB treatment outcomes compared to SAT. Randomized trials 
evaluating the effect of continuation-phase DOT on TB outcomes among PLHIV are 
needed.
