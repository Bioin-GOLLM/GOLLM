Juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) is a carboxylesterase that has attracted great 
interest because of its critical role in regulating larval to adult transition 
in insects and other arthropods. Previously, we characterized an ecdysteroid 
sensitive and juvenile hormone non-susceptible juvenile hormone esterase related 
gene (SnJHER) in the corn stalk borer, Sesamia nonagrioides. SnJHER was 
rhythmically up-regulated close to each molt during the corn stalk borer's 
larval development. In this paper we attempted to functionally characterize 
SnJHER using several reverse genetics techniques. To functionally characterize 
SnJHER, we experimented with different dsRNA administration methods, including 
hemolymph, bacterial or baculovirus-mediated RNA interference, (RNAi). Our 
findings indicate the potential implication of SnJHER in the developmental 
programming of Sesamia nonagrioides. It is still unclear whether SnJHER is 
closely related to the authentic JHE gene, with different or similar biological 
functions.
