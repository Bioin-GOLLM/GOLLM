It is unclear how the human copper (Cu) chaperone Atox1 delivers Cu to 
metal-binding domains of Wilson and Menkes disease proteins in the cytoplasm. To 
begin to address this problem, we have characterized Cu(I) release from 
wild-type Atox1 and two point mutants (Met(10)Ala and Lys(60)Ala). The dynamics 
of Cu(I) displacement from holo-Atox1 were measured by using the Cu(I) chelator 
bicinchonic acid (BCA) as a metal acceptor. BCA removes Cu(I) from Atox1 in a 
three-step process involving the bimolecular formation of an initial 
Atox1-Cu-BCA complex followed by dissociation of Atox1 and the binding of a 
second BCA to generate apo-Atox1 and Cu-BCA(2). Both mutants lose Cu(I) more 
readily than wild-type Atox1 because of more rapid and facile displacement of 
the protein from the Atox1-Cu-BCA intermediate by the second BCA. Remarkably, 
Cu(I) uptake from solution by BCA is much slower than the transfer from 
holo-Atox1, presumably because of slow dissociation of DTT-Cu complexes. These 
results suggest that Cu chaperones play a key role in making Cu(I) rapidly 
accessible to substrates and that the activated protein-metal-chelator complex 
may kinetically mimic the ternary chaperone-metal-target complex involved in 
Cu(I) transfer in vivo.
