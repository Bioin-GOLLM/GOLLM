BACKGROUND: PRDM9 is a key regulator of meiotic recombination in most metazoans, 
responsible for reshuffling parental genomes. During meiosis, the PRDM9 protein 
recognizes and binds specific target motifs via its array of C2H2 zinc-fingers 
encoded by a rapidly evolving minisatellite. The gene coding for PRDM9 is the 
only speciation gene identified in vertebrates to date and shows high variation, 
particularly in the DNA-recognizing positions of the zinc-finger array, within 
and between species. Across all vertebrate genomes studied for PRDM9 evolution, 
only one genome lacks variability between repeat types - that of the North 
Pacific minke whale. This study aims to understand the evolution and diversity 
of Prdm9 in minke whales, which display the most unusual genome reference allele 
of Prdm9 so far discovered in mammals.
RESULTS: Minke whales possess all the features characteristic of PRDM9-directed 
recombination, including complete KRAB, SSXRD and SET domains and a rapidly 
evolving array of C2H2-type-Zincfingers (ZnF) with evidence of rapid evolution, 
particularly at DNA-recognizing positions that evolve under positive 
diversifying selection. Seventeen novel PRDM9 variants were identified within 
the Antarctic minke whale species, plus a single distinct PRDM9 variant in 
Common minke whales - shared across North Atlantic and North Pacific minke whale 
subspecies boundaries.
CONCLUSION: The PRDM9 ZnF array evolves rapidly, in minke whales, with at least 
one DNA-recognizing position under positive selection. Extensive PRDM9 diversity 
is observed, particularly in the Antarctic in minke whales. Common minke whales 
shared a specific Prdm9 allele across subspecies boundaries, suggesting 
incomplete speciation by the mechanisms associated with PRDM9 hybrid sterility.
