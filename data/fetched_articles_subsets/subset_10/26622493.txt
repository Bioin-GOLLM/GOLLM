Papillary tumor of the pineal region (PTPR) was first described as a distinct 
tumor entity in 2003 and was introduced into the World Health Organization 
classification of central nervous system tumors in 2007. This tumor is rare and, 
to the best of our knowledge, only 7 cases have been reported in children <16 
years of age, while the youngest documented patient was a 15-month-old boy. The 
present study reported a case of PTPR in a 10-year-old girl who underwent 
magnetic resonance imaging and surgical resection of tumors. Histological and 
immunohistochemical staining results were presented. Patients with PTPR require 
long-term follow-up, and the patient of the present study has continued to do 
well, with no recurrence of the tumor at the 15-month follow-up examination. In 
addition, a review of the literature on this unusual neoplasm was performed, 
along with discussion of their differential diagnosis.
