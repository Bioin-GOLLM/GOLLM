BACKGROUND Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most 
widespread cancer in humans and its incidence is rising. Novel therapy with 
better efficacy is needed for clinical treatment of cSCC. Many studies have 
shown the importance of DNA repair pathways during the development of cancer. A 
key nucleotide excision repair (NER) protein, xeroderma pigmentosum group D 
(XPD), is responsible for the excision of a large variety of bulky DNA lesions. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS To explore the role of XPD in A431 cells, we overexpressed 
XPD in A431 cells and performed MTT assay, flow cytometry, and Western blot 
analysis to examine cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and genes expression. 
RESULTS We found that the overexpression of XPD suppressed cell viability, 
induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, and promoted cell apoptosis. 
Additionally, XPD blocked the expression of c-myc, cdc25A, and cdk2, and 
improved the levels of HIPK2 and p53. CONCLUSIONS These results provide new 
evidence to reveal the role of XPD in cSCC A431 cells and suggest that XPD may 
serve as an anti-oncogene during cSCC development.
