BACKGROUND: An imbalance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis in bone marrow 
mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) can cause osteoporosis. Macrophage-derived 
exosomes (MD-Exos) and microRNAs (miRNAs) enriched in exosomes participate in 
the differentiation of BMMSCs.
METHODS: Bioinformatics methods were used to analyze differentially expressed 
miRNAs. We cocultured M2 macrophages and BMMSCs to examine the biological 
function of exosomal microRNA-486-5p (miR-486-5p) on BMMSCs differentiation. 
Gain-of-function experiments related to osteogenesis were designed to 
investigate the effects of exosomes carrying miR-486-5p on an ovariectomized 
(OVX) mice model and the direct impact of miR-486-5p on BMMSCs. A dual 
luciferase experiment was performed to demonstrate the target gene of 
miR-486-5p.
RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis identified high expression of miRNA-486 in M2 
macrophage-derived exosomes (M2D-Exos). The in vitro results demonstrated that 
M2 macrophage-derived exosomal miR-486-5p enhanced osteogenic capacity but 
inhibited the adipogenesis of BMMSCs. The direct effect of miR-486-5p on BMMSCs 
showed the same effects. Animal experiments revealed that exosomal miR-486-5p 
rescued bone loss of OVX mice. SMAD2 was characterized as a target gene of 
miR-486-5p. Pathway analysis showed that M2 macrophage-derived exosomal 
miR-486-5p stimulated osteogenic differentiation via the TGF-β/SMAD2 signalling 
pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, M2 macrophage-derived exosomal miR-486-5p 
influences the differentiation potential of BMMSCs through the 
miR-486-5p/SMAD2/TGF-β signalling pathway and osteoporosis.
