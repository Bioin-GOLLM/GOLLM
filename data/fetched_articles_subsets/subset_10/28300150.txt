Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase-1 (UCHL1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme, which 
plays a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is one of the most important 
proteins, which constitute Lewy body in PD patient. However, how this well 
folded highly soluble protein presents in this proteinaceous aggregate is still 
unclear. We report here that UCHL1 undergoes S-nitrosylation in vitro and 
rotenone induced PD mouse model. The preferential nitrosylation in the Cys 90, 
Cys 152 and Cys 220 has been observed which alters the catalytic activity and 
structural stability. We show here that nitrosylation induces structural 
instability and produces amorphous aggregate, which provides a nucleation to the 
native α-synuclein for faster aggregation. Our findings provide a new link 
between UCHL1-nitrosylation and PD pathology.
