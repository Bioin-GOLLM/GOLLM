The ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) plays an important role in normal ovarian 
physiology. During each reproductive cycle, the OSE takes part in the cyclical 
ovulatory ruptures and repair. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
immunolocalization of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptors, tyrosine 
kinase A (TrkA) and p75, in the OSE cells of the wild ground squirrels during 
the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. There were marked variations in ovarian 
weight and size between the breeding and the nonbreeding seasons. 
Histologically, cuboidal cells and squamous cells were identified in the OSE of 
both seasons. Yet, stronger immunostaining of NGF, TrkA and p75 were observed in 
cuboidal cells and squamous cells in the breeding season as compared to the 
nonbreeding season. In addition, plasma gonadotropin concentrations were higher 
in the breeding season than in the nonbreeding season, suggesting that the 
expression patterns of NGF, TrkA and p75 in the OSE were correlated with changes 
in plasma gonadotropins. These findings suggested that NGF and its receptor TrkA 
and p75 may be involved in the regulation of seasonal changes in the OSE of wild 
ground squirrel.in the OSE of wild ground squirrel.
