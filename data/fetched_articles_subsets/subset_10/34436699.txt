INTRODUCTION: The combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors has deeply changed the 
treatment of BRAF V600-mutant non-small cell lung cancer patients. These agents 
demonstrated high antitumor activity as well as safe and manageable toxicity 
profile. Hypertension, pyrexia and increased liver enzymes are the most common 
adverse events. Gastrointestinal toxicities are rare, and mainly consist of mild 
grade vomiting and diarrhea.
CASE REPORT: We report the case of 70-year-old man affected by BRAF V600-mutant 
NSCLC with bilateral lung and bone metastases. First-line treatment with 
encorafenib (450 mg once daily) and binimetinib (45 mg twice daily) was 
administered within a clinical trial. At the first radiological assessment, 
computed tomography (CT) scan showed a partial response and signs of intestinal 
inflammation were reported. The investigational treatment was timely withheld. 
The subsequent colonoscopy demonstrated the presence of ulcerative lesions at 
the caecal tract, and the histological diagnosis suggested a drug-induced 
colitis. No specific treatment was given as the patient did not report abdominal 
disturbances. Forty-five days after treatment interruption a new CT scan showed 
the resolution of bowel inflammation and investigational treatment was resumed 
at the same doses. The patient is still alive and free of toxicity recurrence 
after 11 months from treatment initiation. Conclusion. Severe gastrointestinal 
toxicities are uncommon with BRAF and MEK inhibitors, although cases of colitis 
and intestinal perforation have already been reported in literature. The 
pathogenesis seems to be related to the MAPK pathway inhibition performed by MEK 
inhibitors. These adverse events should be accounted given the potential to 
evolve into life-threatening conditions.
