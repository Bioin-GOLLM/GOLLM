A volume-regulated chloride current (ICl.vol) is ubiquitously present in 
mammalian cells, and is required for the regulation of electrical activity, cell 
volume, intracellular pH, immunological responses, cell proliferation and 
differentiation. However, the molecule responsible for ICl.vol has yet to be 
determined. Although three putative chloride channel proteins expressed from 
cloned genes (P-glycoprotein, pICln and ClC-2 ) have been proposed to be the 
molecular equivalent of ICl.vol, neither P-glycoprotein nor pICln is thought to 
be a chloride channel or part thereof, and the properties of expressed ClC-2 
channels differ from native ICl.vol. Here we report that functional expression 
in NIH/3T3 cells of a cardiac clone of another member of the ClC family, ClC-3, 
results in a large basally active chloride conductance, which is strongly 
modulated by cell volume and exhibits many properties identical to those of 
ICl.vol in native cells. A mutation of asparagine to lysine at position 579 at 
the end of the transmembrane domains of ClC-3 abolishes the outward 
rectification and changes the anion selectivity from I- > Cl- to Cl- > I- but 
leaves swelling activation intact. Because ClC-3 is a channel protein belonging 
to a large gene family of chloride channels, these results indicate that ClC-3 
encodes ICl.vol in many native mammalian cells.
