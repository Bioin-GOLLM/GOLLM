Angiogenesis is essential for tissue development, wound healing and tissue 
perfusion, with its dysregulation linked to tumorigenesis, rheumatoid arthritis 
and heart disease. Here we show that pro-angiogenic stimuli couple to NADPH 
oxidase-dependent generation of oxidants that catalyse an activating 
intermolecular-disulphide between regulatory-RIα subunits of protein kinase A 
(PKA), which stimulates PKA-dependent ERK signalling. This is crucial to blood 
vessel growth as 'redox-dead' Cys17Ser RIα knock-in mice fully resistant to PKA 
disulphide-activation have deficient angiogenesis in models of hind limb 
ischaemia and tumour-implant growth. Disulphide-activation of PKA represents a 
new therapeutic target in diseases with aberrant angiogenesis.
