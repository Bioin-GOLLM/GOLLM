BACKGROUND: Heritable alterations in CDKN2A account for a subset of familial 
melanoma cases although no robust method exists to identify those at risk of 
being a mutation carrier.
METHODS: We set out to construct a model for estimating CDKN2A mutation carrier 
probability using a cohort of 116 consecutive familial cutaneous melanoma 
patients evaluated at Massachusetts General Hospital Pigmented Lesion Center 
between April 2001 and September 2004. Germline CDKN2A and CDK4 status on the 
familial melanoma cases and clinical features associated with mutational status 
were then used to build a multiple logistic regression model to predict carrier 
probability and performance of model on external validation.
RESULTS: From the 116 kindreds prone to melanoma in the Boston area, 13 CDKN2A 
mutation carriers were identified and 12 were subsequently used in the modeling. 
Proband age at diagnosis, number of proband primaries, and number of additional 
family primaries were most closely associated with germline mutations. The 
estimated probability of the proband being a mutation carrier based on the 
logistic regression model (MELPREDICT) is given by e(L)/(1 + e(L) where L = 
1.99+[0.92x(no. of proband primaries)]+[0.74x(no. of additional family 
primaries)]-[2.11xln(age)]. The mean estimated probabilities for subjects in the 
Boston dataset were 55.4% and 5.1% for the mutation carriers and non-carriers 
respectively. In a receiver operator characteristic analysis, the area under the 
curve was 0.881 (95% confidence interval 0.739 to 1.000) for the Boston model 
set (n = 116) and 0.803 (0.729 to 0.877) for an external Toronto hereditary 
melanoma cohort (n = 143).
CONCLUSIONS: These results represent the first-iteration logistic regression 
model to approximate CDKN2A carrier probability. Validation of this model with 
an external dataset revealed relatively robust performance.
