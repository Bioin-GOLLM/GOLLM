BACKGROUND: Chimeric transcripts, including partial and internal tandem 
duplications (PTDs, ITDs) and gene fusions, are important in the detection, 
prognosis, and treatment of human cancers.
RESULTS: We describe Barnacle, a production-grade analysis tool that detects 
such chimeras in de novo assemblies of RNA-seq data, and supports prioritizing 
them for review and validation by reporting the relative coverage of 
co-occurring chimeric and wild-type transcripts. We demonstrate applications in 
large-scale disease studies, by identifying PTDs in MLL, ITDs in FLT3, and 
reciprocal fusions between PML and RARA, in two deeply sequenced acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) RNA-seq datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses of real and simulated data sets show that, with 
appropriate filter settings, Barnacle makes highly specific predictions for 
three types of chimeric transcripts that are important in a range of cancers: 
PTDs, ITDs, and fusions. High specificity makes manual review and validation 
efficient, which is necessary in large-scale disease studies. Characterizing an 
extended range of chimera types will help generate insights into progression, 
treatment, and outcomes for complex diseases.
