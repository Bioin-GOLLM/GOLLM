The association between matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene rs3918242 
polymorphism and the risk of stroke has been investigated, but the findings have 
been found to be contradictory. Thus, this association was assessed 
by meta-analysis. Potential studies were searched throughout PubMed, Embase, and 
CNKI. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Sixteen 
original studies analyzing this association were included, involving 3647 stroke 
patients and 3685 unrelated controls. It was confirmed that MMP-9 gene rs3918242 
polymorphism increased the risk of stroke. Stratification analysis of ethnicity 
revealed an increased risk of stroke among Asians, but not among Caucasians. 
Subgroup analysis by the type of stroke showed that MMP-9 gene rs3918242 
polymorphism increased the risk of ischemic stroke. Sensitivity analysis did not 
draw different findings. In conclusion, MMP-9 gene rs3918242 polymorphism 
increases the risk of stroke.
