Several electronic applications must withstand elevated temperatures during 
their lifetime. Materials and packages for use in high temperatures have been 
designed, but they are often very expensive, have limited compatibility with 
materials, structures, and processing techniques, and are less readily available 
than traditional materials. Thus, there is an increasing interest in using 
low-cost polymer materials in high temperature applications. This paper studies 
the performance and reliability of sensor structures attached with 
anisotropically conductive adhesive film (ACF) on two different organic printed 
circuit board (PCB) materials: FR-4 and Rogers. The test samples were aged at 
200 °C and 240 °C and monitored electrically during the test. Material 
characterization techniques were also used to analyze the behavior of the 
materials. Rogers PCB was observed to be more stable at high temperatures in 
spite of degradation observed, especially during the first 120 h of aging. The 
electrical reliability was very good with Rogers. At 200 °C, the failures 
occurred after 2000 h of testing, and even at 240 °C the interconnections were 
functional for 400 h. The study indicates that, even though these ACFs were not 
designed for use in high temperatures, with stable PCB material they are 
promising interconnection materials at elevated temperatures, especially at 200 
°C. However, the fragility of the structure due to material degradation may 
cause reliability problems in long-term high temperature exposure.
