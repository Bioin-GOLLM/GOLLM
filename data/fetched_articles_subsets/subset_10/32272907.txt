BACKGROUND: RIPK1 (receptor-interacting protein kinase-1) plays a role in cancer 
development, whereas no clear studies focused on the cervical cancer. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between RIPK1 
polymorphisms and cervical cancer risk among the Uyghur population.
METHODS: We performed a case-control study including 342 cervical cancer 
patients and 498 age-matched healthy controls. Four RIPK1 genetic variants 
(rs6907943, rs2077681, rs9503400 and rs17548629) were genotyped with Agena 
MassARRAY platform. The associations between RIPK1 polymorphisms and cervical 
cancer risk were assessed under Binary logistic regression models. False 
discovery rate (FDR) was used to improve the results reliability.
RESULTS: The results showed rs2077681 was significantly associated with cervical 
cancer risk under various genetic models (codominant: OR = 3.14, 95% 
CI = 1.40-7.07, p = 0.006, FDR-p = 0.018; recessive: OR = 3.20, 95% 
CI = 1.43-7.16, p = 0.005, FDR-0.018). The stratified analysis indicated that 
the relationships of rs6907946, rs9503400 and rs17548629 with cervical cancer 
risk were statistically significant in the subgroup of clinical stage 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that RIPK1 polymorphisms were associated 
with cervical cancer susceptibility among the Uyghur population in China, and 
RIPK1 polymorphisms might be involved in the development of cervical cancer.
