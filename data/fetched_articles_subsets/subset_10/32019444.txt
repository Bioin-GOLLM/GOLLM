Diseases that spread to humans from animals, zoonoses, pose major threats to 
human health. Identifying animal reservoirs of zoonoses and predicting future 
outbreaks are increasingly important to human health and well-being and economic 
stability, particularly where research and resources are limited. Here, we 
integrate complex networks and machine learning approaches to develop a new 
approach to identifying reservoirs. An exhaustive dataset of mammal-pathogen 
interactions was transformed into networks where hosts are linked via their 
shared pathogens. We present a methodology for identifying important and 
influential hosts in these networks. Ensemble models linking network 
characteristics with phylogeny and life-history traits are then employed to 
predict those key hosts and quantify the roles they undertake in pathogen 
transmission. Our models reveal drivers explaining host importance and 
demonstrate how these drivers vary by pathogen taxa. Host importance is further 
integrated into ensemble models to predict reservoirs of zoonoses of various 
pathogen taxa and quantify the extent of pathogen sharing between humans and 
mammals. We establish predictors of reservoirs of zoonoses, showcasing host 
influence to be a key factor in determining these reservoirs. Finally, we 
provide new insight into the determinants of zoonosis-sharing, and contrast 
these determinants across major pathogen taxa.
