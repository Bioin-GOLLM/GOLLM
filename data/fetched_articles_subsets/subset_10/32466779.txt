BACKGROUND: Endocrine therapy is recommended as a first-line treatment for 
hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (HR+MBC) patients. No 
biomarker has been validated to predict tumor progression in that setting. We 
aimed to prospectively compare the risk of early progression according to 
circulating ESR1 mutations, CA-15.3, and circulating cell-free DNA in MBC 
patients treated with a first-line aromatase inhibitor (AI).
METHODS: Patients with MBC treated with a first-line AI were prospectively 
included. Circulating biomarker assessment was performed every 3 months. The 
primary objective was to determine the risk of progression or death at the next 
follow-up visit (after 3 months) in case of circulating ESR1 mutation detection 
among patients treated with a first-line AI for HR+MBC.
RESULTS: Overall, 103 patients were included, and 70 (68%) had progressive 
disease (PD). Circulating ESR1 mutations were detected in 22/70 patients with PD 
and in 0/33 patients without progression (p < 0.001). Among the ESR1-mutated 
patients, 18/22 had a detectable mutation prior to progression, with a median 
delay of 110 days from first detection to PD. The detection of circulating ESR1 
mutations was associated with a 4.9-fold (95% CI 3.0-8.0) increase in the risk 
of PD at 3 months. Using a threshold value of 25% or 100%, a CA-15.3 increase 
was also correlated with progression (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). In 
contrast to ESR1, the CA-15.3 increase occurred concomitantly with PD in most 
cases, in 27/47 (57%) with a 25% threshold and in 21/25 (84%) with a 100% 
threshold. Using a threshold value of either 25% or 100%, cfDNA increase was not 
correlated with progression.
CONCLUSION: The emergence of circulating ESR1 mutations is associated with a 
4.9-fold increase in the risk of early PD during AI treatment in HR+MBC. Our 
results also highlighted that tracking circulating ESR1 mutations is more 
relevant than tracking CA-15.3 or cfDNA increase to predict progression in this 
setting.
