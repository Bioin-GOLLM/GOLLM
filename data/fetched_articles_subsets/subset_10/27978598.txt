BACKGROUND: Inflammation might link microbial exposures to insulin resistance. 
We investigated the cross-sectional association between periodontal microbiota, 
inflammation and insulin resistance.
METHODS: The Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study 
(ORIGINS) enrolled 152 diabetes-free adults (77% female) aged 20-55 years 
(mean = 34 ± 10). Three hundred and four subgingival plaque samples were 
analysed using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray to measure the 
relative abundances of 379 taxa. C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumour 
necrosis factor-α and adiponectin were assessed from venous blood and their 
z-scores were summed to create an inflammatory score (IS). Insulin resistance 
was defined via the HOMA-IR. Associations between the microbiota and both 
inflammation and HOMA-IR were explored using multivariable linear regressions; 
mediation analyses assessed the proportion of the association explained by 
inflammation.
RESULTS: The IS was inversely associated with Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria 
and positively associated with Firmicutes and TM7 (p-values < 0.05). 
Proteobacteria levels were associated with insulin resistance (p < 0.05). 
Inflammation explained 30-98% of the observed associations between levels of 
Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria or Firmicutes and insulin resistance 
(p-values < 0.05). Eighteen individual taxa were associated with inflammation 
(p < 0.05) and 22 with insulin resistance (p < 0.05). No findings for individual 
taxa met Bonferroni-adjusted statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: Bacterial measures were related to inflammation and insulin 
resistance among diabetes-free adults.
