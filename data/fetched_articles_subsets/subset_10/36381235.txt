Patients with radioresistant breast cancers, including a large percentage of 
women with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), demonstrate limited response to 
radiation (RT) and increased locoregional recurrence; thus, strategies to 
increase the efficacy of RT in TNBC are critically needed. We demonstrate that 
pan Bcl-2 family inhibition (ABT-263, rER: 1.52-1.56) or Bcl-xL specific 
inhibition (WEHI-539, A-1331852; rER: 1.31-2.00) radiosensitized wild-type 
PIK3CA/PTEN TNBC (MDA-MB-231, CAL-120) but failed to radiosensitize mutant 
PIK3CA/PTEN TNBC (rER: 0.90 - 1.07; MDA-MB-468, CAL-51, SUM-159). Specific 
inhibition of Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 did not induce radiosensitization, regardless of 
PIK3CA/PTEN status (rER: 0.95 - 1.07). In wild-type PIK3CA/PTEN TNBC, pan Bcl-2 
family inhibition or Bcl-xL specific inhibition with RT led to increased levels 
of apoptosis (p < 0.001) and an increase in cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3. 
CRISPR-mediated PTEN knockout in wild-type PIK3CA/PTEN MDA-MB-231 and CAL-120 
cells induced expression of pAKT/Akt and Mcl-1 and abolished Bcl-xL 
inhibitor-mediated radiosensitization (rER: 0.94 - 1.07). Similarly, Mcl-1 
overexpression abolished radiosensitization in MDA-MB-231 and CAL-120 cells 
(rER: 1.02 - 1.04) but transient MCL1 knockdown in CAL-51 cells promoted 
Bcl-xL-inhibitor mediated radiosensitization (rER 2.35 Â± 0.05). In vivo, ABT-263 
or A-1331852 in combination with RT decreased tumor growth and increased tumor 
tripling time (p < 0.0001) in PIK3CA/PTEN wild-type TNBC cell line and 
patient-derived xenografts. Collectively, this study provides the preclinical 
rationale for early phase clinical trials testing the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of Bcl-xL inhibition and RT in women with wild-type PIK3CA/PTEN 
wild-type TNBC at high risk for recurrence.
