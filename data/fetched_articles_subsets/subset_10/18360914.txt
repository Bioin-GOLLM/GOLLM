Mutations in the MID1 gene are responsible for the X-linked form of Opitz G/BBB 
syndrome (OS), a disorder that affects the development of midline structures. OS 
is characterized by hypertelorism, hypospadias, laryngo-tracheo-esophageal (LTE) 
abnormalities, and additional midline defects. Cardiac, anal, and neurological 
defects are also present. The expressivity of OS is highly variable, even within 
the same family. We reviewed all the MID1 mutations reported so far, in both 
familial and sporadic cases. The mutations are scattered along the entire length 
of the gene and consist of missense and nonsense mutations, insertions and 
deletions, either in-frame or causing frameshifts, and deletions of either 
single exons or the entire MID1 coding region. The variety of described 
mutations and the lack of a strict genotype-phenotype correlation confirm the 
previous suggestion of the OS phenotype being caused by a loss-of-function 
mechanism. However, although a specific mutation cannot entirely account for the 
observed phenotype, we observed preferential association between some types of 
mutation and specific clinical manifestations, e.g., brain anatomical defects 
and truncating mutations. This may suggest that the pathogenetic mechanism 
underlying the OS phenotype is more complex and may vary among the affected 
organs.
