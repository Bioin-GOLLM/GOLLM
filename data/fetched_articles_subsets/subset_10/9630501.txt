A shuttle mutagenesis system was developed for the dimorphic yeast Yarrowia 
lipolytica. This system combines transposon insertions generated in Escherichia 
coli with the transformation of yeast with the Tn-mutagenized DNA. The 
mini-transposon mTn-3xHA/GFP, used in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for producing 
stable insertions, was adapted for use in the yeast Y. lipolytica. The mTnYl1 
transposon (for mini-Tn of Y. lipolytica) confers resistance to tetracycline in 
E. coli. It also contains the Y. lipolytica URA3 gene for selection of yeast 
transformants, and the coding sequence for the S65T mutant form of GFP. The rare 
cutter endonuclease, I-SceI, restriction site, which enables identification of 
the chromosomal localization of mutagenized genes, was also incorporated. mTnYl1 
was first tested on the ACO1 gene, which encodes an Acyl CoA oxidase isozyme. 
The mutagenesis system was further validated on a Y. lipolytica genomic DNA 
library constructed in a pHSS6 derivative vector. Mutants with a particular 
morphology or defective for alkane, fatty acids and oil degradation were 
obtained.
