Selenocysteine (Sec) is translationally incorporated into proteins in response 
to the UGA codon. The tRNA specific to Sec (tRNA(Sec)) is first ligated with 
serine by seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS). In the present study, we determined the 
3.1 Ã… crystal structure of the tRNA(Sec) from the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, in 
complex with the heterologous SerRS from the archaeon Methanopyrus kandleri. The 
bacterial tRNA(Sec) assumes the L-shaped structure, from which the long extra 
arm protrudes. Although the D-arm conformation and the extra-arm orientation are 
similar to those of eukaryal/archaeal tRNA(Sec)s, A. aeolicus tRNA(Sec) has 
unique base triples, G14:C21:U8 and C15:G20a:G48, which occupy the positions 
corresponding to the U8:A14 and R15:Y48 tertiary base pairs of canonical tRNAs. 
Methanopyrus kandleri SerRS exhibited serine ligation activity toward A. 
aeolicus tRNA(Sec) in vitro. The SerRS N-terminal domain interacts with the 
extra-arm stem and the outer corner of tRNA(Sec). Similar interactions exist in 
the reported tRNA(Ser) and SerRS complex structure from the bacterium Thermus 
thermophilus. Although the catalytic C-terminal domain of M. kandleri SerRS 
lacks interactions with A. aeolicus tRNA(Sec) in the present complex structure, 
the conformational flexibility of SerRS is likely to allow the CCA terminal 
region of tRNA(Sec) to enter the SerRS catalytic site.
