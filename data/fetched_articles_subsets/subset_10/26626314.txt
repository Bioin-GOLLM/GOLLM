Hereditary cerebellar ataxias and hereditary spastic paraplegias are clinically 
and genetically heterogeneous and often overlapping neurological disorders. 
Mutations in SPG7 cause the autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 7 
(SPG7), but recent studies indicate that they are also one of the most common 
causes of recessive cerebellar ataxia. In Quebec, a significant number of 
patients affected with cerebellar ataxia and spasticity remain without a 
molecular diagnosis. We performed whole-exome sequencing in three French 
Canadian (FC) patients affected with spastic ataxia and uncovered compound 
heterozygous variants in SPG7 in all three. Sanger sequencing of SPG7 exons and 
exon/intron boundaries was used to screen additional patients. In total, we 
identified recessive variants in SPG7 in 22 FC patients belonging to 12 families 
(38.7% of the families screened), including two novel variants. The 
p.(Ala510Val) variant was the most common in our cohort. Cerebellar features, 
including ataxia, were more pronounced than spasticity in this cohort. These 
results strongly suggest that variants affecting the function of SPG7 are the 
fourth most common form of recessive ataxia in FC patients. Thus, we propose 
that SPG7 mutations explain a significant proportion of FC spastic ataxia cases 
and that this gene should be considered in unresolved patients.
