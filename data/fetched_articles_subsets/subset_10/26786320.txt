BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is an orally active multikinase tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI) that targets B-type Raf kinase (BRAF), vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptors (VEGFR) 1 and 2, and rearranged during transfection (RET), inducing 
anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic actions in a wide range of solid tumors. A 
side effect of sorafenib is the occurrence of cutaneous squamous tumors.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we describe three patients with a history of sorafenib 
treatment for advanced radioactive iodine refractory papillary thyroid cancer 
(two with a BRAF c.1799 T > A and one carrying a rare c.1799-1801het_delTGA 
mutation) who presented with secondary non-cutaneous lesions. The first patient 
was diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue, the second 
patient with a primary adenocarcinoma of the lung, and the third with a SCC 
originating from the cricoid. Secondary analysis was required to show that the 
latter two presentations were in fact recurrent thyroid cancer.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that drugs such as sorafenib may induce 
metaplasia/clonal divergence of metastatic thyroid cancer and thus cause 
diagnostic misclassification. Furthermore, sorafenib is potentially involved in 
the tumorigenesis of secondary non-cutaneous SCC. These observations should now 
be confirmed in larger series of patients treated with drugs such as sorafenib.
