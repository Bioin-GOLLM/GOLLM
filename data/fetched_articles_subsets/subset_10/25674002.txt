BACKGROUND: Patients harboring activating mutations in epidermal growth factor 
receptors (EGFR) are particularly sensitive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs). However, most patients develop an acquired resistance after a period of 
about 10 months. This study focuses on the therapeutic effect of NVP-BEZ235, a 
dual inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin 
(PI3K/mTOR), in gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer.
METHODS: H1975 cell line was validated as a gefitinib-resistant cell model by 
the nucleotide-sequence analysis. We used the 
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to 
detect the growth of H1975 cell line in vitro. H1975 cells' migration was 
detected by the migration assay. Xenograft models were used to investigate the 
growth of gefitinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer in vivo. Western blot 
and immunohistochemical analysis were used to investigate the level of 
PI3K/protein kinase B(AKT)/mTOR signaling pathway proteins.
RESULTS: We show that NVP-BEZ235 effectively inhibited the growth of H1975 cells 
in vivo as well as in vitro. Similarly, H1975 cell migration was reduced by 
NVP-BEZ235. Further experiments revealed that NVP-BEZ235 attenuated the 
phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway proteins.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, we suggest that NVP-BEZ235 inhibits 
gefitinib-resistant tumor growth by downregulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
phosphorylation.
