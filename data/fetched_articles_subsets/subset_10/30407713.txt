Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a major cereal grain widely used for livestock 
feed, brewing malts and human food. Grain yield is the most important breeding 
target for genetic improvement and largely depends on optimal timing of 
flowering. Little is known about the allelic diversity of genes that underlie 
flowering time in domesticated barley, the genetic changes that have occurred 
during breeding, and their impact on yield and adaptation. Here, we report a 
comprehensive genomic assessment of a worldwide collection of 895 barley 
accessions based on the targeted resequencing of phenology genes. A versatile 
target-capture method was used to detect genome-wide polymorphisms in a panel of 
174 flowering time-related genes, chosen based on prior knowledge from barley, 
rice and Arabidopsis thaliana. Association studies identified novel 
polymorphisms that accounted for observed phenotypic variation in phenology and 
grain yield, and explained improvements in adaptation as a result of historical 
breeding of Australian barley cultivars. We found that 50% of genetic variants 
associated with grain yield, and 67% of the plant height variation was also 
associated with phenology. The precise identification of favourable alleles 
provides a genomic basis to improve barley yield traits and to enhance 
adaptation for specific production areas.
