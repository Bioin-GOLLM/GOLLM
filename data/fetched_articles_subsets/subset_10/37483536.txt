Repetitive elements have been identified in several amphibian genomes using 
whole genome sequencing, but few studies have used cytogenetic mapping to 
visualize these elements in this vertebrate group. Here, we used fluorescence in 
situ hybridization and genomic data to map the U1 and U2 small nuclear RNAs and 
histone H3 in six species of African clawed frog (genus Xenopus), including, 
from subgenus Silurana, the diploid Xenopus tropicalis and its close 
allotetraploid relative X. calcaratus and, from subgenus Xenopus, the 
allotetraploid species X. pygmaeus, X. allofraseri, X. laevis, and X. muelleri. 
Results allowed us to qualitatively evaluate the relative roles of 
polyploidization and divergence in the evolution of repetitive elements because 
our focal species include allotetraploid species derived from two independent 
polyploidization events - one that is relatively young that gave rise to X. 
calcaratus and another that is older that gave rise to the other 
(older) allotetraploids. Our results demonstrated conserved loci number and 
position of signals in the species from subgenus Silurana; allotetraploid X. 
calcaratus has twice as many signals as diploid X. tropicalis. However, the 
content of repeats varied among the other allotetraploid species. We detected 
almost same number of signals in X. muelleri as in X. calcaratus and same number 
of signals in X. pygmaeus, X. allofraseri, X. laevis as in the diploid X. 
tropicalis. Overall, these results are consistent with the proposal that 
allopolyploidization duplicated these tandem repeats and that variation in 
their copy number was accumulated over time through reduction and expansion in a 
subset of the older allopolyploids.
