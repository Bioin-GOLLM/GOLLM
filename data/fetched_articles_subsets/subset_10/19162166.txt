Benzene is an established cause of leukemia, and possibly lymphoma, in humans, 
but the underlying molecular pathways remain largely undetermined. We used two 
microarray platforms to identify global gene expression changes associated with 
well-characterized occupational benzene exposure in the peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) of a population of shoe-factory workers. Differential 
expression of 2692 genes (Affymetrix) and 1828 genes (Illumina) was found and 
the concordance was 50% (based on an average fold-change > or =1.3 from the two 
platforms), with similar expression ratios among the concordant genes. Four 
genes (CXCL16, ZNF331, JUN and PF4), which we previously identified by 
microarray and confirmed by real-time PCR, were among the top 100 genes 
identified by both platforms in the current study. Gene ontology analysis showed 
overrepresentation of genes involved in apoptosis among the concordant genes 
while pathway analysis identified pathways related to lipid metabolism. The 
two-platform approach allows for robust changes in the PBMC transcriptome of 
benzene-exposed individuals to be identified.
