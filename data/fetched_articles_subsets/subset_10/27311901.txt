INTRODUCTION: Evidence from observational studies and randomised controlled 
trials suggests that breastfeeding is positively associated with IQ, possibly 
because breast milk is a source of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. 
Different studies have detected gene-breastfeeding interactions involving FADS2 
variants and intelligence. However, findings are inconsistent regarding the 
direction of such effect modification.
METHODS/DESIGN: To clarify how FADS2 and breastfeeding interact in their 
association with IQ, we are conducting a consortium-based meta-analysis of 
independent studies. Results produced by each individual study using 
standardised analysis scripts and harmonised data will be used.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: breastfeeding, IQ and either rs174575 or rs1535 
polymorphisms available; and being of European ancestry.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: twin studies; only poorly imputed genetic data available; or 
unavailability of proper ethics approval. Studies will be invited based on being 
known to have at least some of the required data, or suggested by participating 
studies as potentially eligible. This inclusive approach will favour achieving a 
larger sample size and be less prone to publication bias.
DISCUSSION: Improving current understanding of FADS2-breastfeeding interaction 
may provide important biological insights regarding the importance of long-chain 
polyunsaturated fatty acids for the breastfeeding-IQ association. This 
meta-analysis will help to improve such knowledge by replicating earlier 
studies, conducting additional analysis and evaluating different sources of 
heterogeneity. Publishing this protocol will minimise the possibility of bias 
due to post hoc changes to the analysis protocol.
