Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED) [OMIM 131300] is a rare autosomal dominant 
disorder characterized by bone pain and osteosclerosis affecting the diaphysis 
of long bones. It has been previously reported that CED is caused by mutations 
of the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta1) gene on chromosome 
19q13.1-q13.3. Until now, seven mutations (LLL12-13ins, Y81H, R156C, R218C, 
R218H, H222D, C225R) in Australian, French, Belgian, Japanese, and European 
families have been reported and these data showed that there was no correlation 
between the nature of the mutations and the variability of the clinical 
manifestations. In this study, we found a Chinese family with CED and observed 
some intra-familial clinical variability and symptoms that became more severe 
with the age. A new TGF beta1 mutation (E169K) in exon 2 was identified in the 
Chinese family using polymerase chain reaction, direct sequencing analysis of 
PCR products and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. This mutation 
has not been previously reported in other countries in the world.
