Interindividual differences in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 activity may result in 
variations in the therapeutic response to drugs metabolized by this enzyme. 
Differences at gene level may translate into protein level with consequent 
impairment of the enzyme activity. As a result patients with such genetic 
differences might experience undesirable effects or no effect at all. The aim of 
the present study was to find out the prevalence of allelic and genotype 
frequencies of low activity variants of CYP2C19 genes in healthy individuals 
from six distinct ethnicities of Pakistan. Blood sample was taken from healthy 
volunteers following informed consent. Isolation of the DNA was followed by the 
PCR amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Selected samples 
were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The frequency of major alleles was 84.93% 
for CYP2C19*2 and 91.85% for CYP2C19*3, while minor allele was present at 15.06% 
for CYP2C19*2 and 8.14% for CYP2C19*3. For CYP2C19*2, the frequency of *1*1 
genotype was 75.80%, *1*2 was 18.27%, and *2*2 was 5.92% whereas for CYP2C19*3, 
The frequency of *1*1 genotype was 84.19%, *1*3 was 15.30%, and *3*3 was 0.49% 
in the Pakistani population. A substantial variation in genotype and allelic 
frequencies was observed in various ethnicities. Our study demonstrates that a 
significant Pakistani population has at least one minor allele, which indicates 
a large number of patients potentially being affected by these variations. 
Especially, a significant genotype frequency of PM suggests implication for the 
treatment response and severity/frequency of adverse effects in patients 
receiving drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.
