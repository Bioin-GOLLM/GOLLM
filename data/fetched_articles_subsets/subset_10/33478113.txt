This review summarizes the knowledge about retrogenes in the context of cancer 
and evolution. The retroposition, in which the processed mRNA from parental 
genes undergoes reverse transcription and the resulting cDNA is integrated back 
into the genome, results in additional copies of existing genes. Despite the 
initial misconception, retroposition-derived copies can become functional, and 
due to their role in the molecular evolution of genomes, they have been named 
the "seeds of evolution". It is convincing that retrogenes, as important 
elements involved in the evolution of species, also take part in the evolution 
of neoplastic tumors at the cell and species levels. The occurrence of specific 
"resistance mechanisms" to neoplastic transformation in some species has been 
noted. This phenomenon has been related to additional gene copies, including 
retrogenes. In addition, the role of retrogenes in the evolution of tumors has 
been described. Retrogene expression correlates with the occurrence of specific 
cancer subtypes, their stages, and their response to therapy. Phylogenetic 
insights into retrogenes show that most cancer-related retrocopies arose in the 
lineage of primates, and the number of identified cancer-related retrogenes 
demonstrates that these duplicates are quite important players in human 
carcinogenesis.
