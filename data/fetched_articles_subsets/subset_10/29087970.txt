Clozapine is the drug of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, 
its use is associated with variable clinical responses and serious adverse 
effects. Polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins involved in synaptic 
neurotransmission may account for such variability. Here, we studied independent 
and epistatic genetic associations of polymorphisms in DRD4 (120-bp duplication) 
and COMT (Val158Met) with clinical response to clozapine in people with 
treatment-resistant schizophrenia. We studied 93 participants who were on stable 
doses of clozapine for at least 12 weeks. A total score of less than or equal to 
35 on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was defined as a clinical response. The 
genetic associations were tested using logistic regression analyses. Neither 
polymorphism studied was found to be independently associated with response to 
clozapine. However, a statistically significant gene-gene interaction was 
observed between the polymorphisms. Participants with the COMT Val/Met or 
Met/Met genotype, who also had one or two DRD4 120-bp alleles (120/240 and 
120/120), showed significantly better clinical response to clozapine. Our 
results highlight the importance of investigating gene-gene interactions, while 
studying the pharmacogenetics of clozapine.
