A facile and novel colorimetric method for screening of α-glucosidase inhibitors 
(AGIs) from flavonoids using 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a 
chromogenic probe is proposed. This method is based on the colorimetric 
detection of ascorbic acid (AA) through the TMB oxidation reaction catalyzed by 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the 
TMB/H2O2/HRP system, HRP catalyzes the oxidation of H2O2 to ‧OH radical which 
oxidizes TMB to blue-colored oxidized TMB (oxTMB). In the presence of AA, the 
production of ‧OH radical is suppressed and causes the decrease of oxTMB, 
resulting in the fading of the blue color and the decrease of absorbance at 652 
nm. Based on this, the existence of AA can be facilely identified. In the 
2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic acid (AA-2 G)/α-glucosidase (α-Glu) system, 
the produced AA inhibits the oxidation of TMB to blue-colored oxTMB. In the 
presence of AGIs, the production of AA is inhibited, which inhibits the 
reduction of oxTMB, resulting in a blue color recovery and an increase of the 
absorbance at 652 nm. Based on this, the colorimetric method is developed for 
screening of AGIs from 7 flavonoids.
