The vascular wall is a source of progenitor cells that are able to induce 
skeletal repair, primarily by paracrine mechanisms. Here, the paracrine role of 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) in bone healing was investigated. First, purified 
human perivascular stem cells (PSCs) were observed to induce mitogenic, 
pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic effects on osteoprogenitor cells while in 
non-contact co-culture via elaboration of EVs. PSC-derived EVs shared mitogenic, 
pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic properties of their parent cell. PSC-EV 
effects were dependent on surface-associated tetraspanins, as demonstrated by EV 
trypsinization, or neutralizing antibodies for CD9 or CD81. Moreover, shRNA 
knockdown in recipient cells demonstrated requirement for the CD9/CD81 binding 
partners IGSF8 and PTGFRN for EV bioactivity. Finally, PSC-EVs stimulated bone 
repair, and did so via stimulation of skeletal cell proliferation, migration, 
and osteodifferentiation. In sum, PSC-EVs mediate the same tissue repair effects 
of perivascular stem cells, and represent an 'off-the-shelf' alternative for 
bone tissue regeneration.
