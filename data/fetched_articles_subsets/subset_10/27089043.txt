The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) is highly heritable in humans and yet 
little is known about the genetic basis of inter-individual differences in sleep 
architecture. The aim of this study was to identify associations between 
candidate circadian gene variants and the polysomnogram, recorded under highly 
controlled laboratory conditions during a baseline, overnight, 8 h sleep 
opportunity. A candidate gene approach was employed to analyze single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms from five circadian-related genes in a two-phase analysis of 84 
healthy young adults (28 F; 23.21 Â± 2.97 years) of European ancestry. A common 
variant in Period2 (PER2) was associated with 20 min less slow-wave sleep (SWS) 
in carriers of the minor allele than in noncarriers, representing a 22% 
reduction in SWS duration. Moreover, spectral analysis in a subset of 
participants (n = 37) showed the same PER2 polymorphism was associated with 
reduced EEG power density in the low delta range (0.25-1.0 Hz) during non-REM 
sleep and lower slow-wave activity (0.75-4.5 Hz) in the early part of the sleep 
episode. These results indicate the involvement of PER2 in the homeostatic 
process of sleep. Additionally, a rare variant in Melatonin Receptor 1B was 
associated with longer REM sleep latency, with minor allele carriers exhibiting 
an average of 65 min (87%) longer latency from sleep onset to REM sleep, 
compared to noncarriers. These findings suggest that circadian-related genes can 
modulate sleep architecture and the sleep EEG, including specific parameters 
previously implicated in the homeostatic regulation of sleep.
