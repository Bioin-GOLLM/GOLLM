The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat 
(CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated genes (Cas) adaptive immune system defends microbes 
against foreign genetic elements via DNA or RNA-DNA interference. We 
characterize the class 2 type VI CRISPR-Cas effector C2c2 and demonstrate its 
RNA-guided ribonuclease function. C2c2 from the bacterium Leptotrichia shahii 
provides interference against RNA phage. In vitro biochemical analysis shows 
that C2c2 is guided by a single CRISPR RNA and can be programmed to cleave 
single-stranded RNA targets carrying complementary protospacers. In bacteria, 
C2c2 can be programmed to knock down specific mRNAs. Cleavage is mediated by 
catalytic residues in the two conserved Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes 
Nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domains, mutations of which generate catalytically 
inactive RNA-binding proteins. These results broaden our understanding of 
CRISPR-Cas systems and suggest that C2c2 can be used to develop new 
RNA-targeting tools.
