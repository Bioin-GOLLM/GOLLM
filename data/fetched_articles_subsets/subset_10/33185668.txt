Regulated trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) controls 
cilium-based signaling pathways. β-Arrestin, a molecular sensor of activated 
GPCRs, and the BBSome, a complex of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins, are 
required for the signal-dependent exit of ciliary GPCRs, but the functional 
interplay between β-arrestin and the BBSome remains elusive. Here we find that, 
upon activation, ciliary GPCRs become tagged with ubiquitin chains comprising 
K63 linkages (UbK63) in a β-arrestin-dependent manner before BBSome-mediated 
exit. Removal of ubiquitin acceptor residues from the somatostatin receptor 3 
(SSTR3) and from the orphan GPCR GPR161 demonstrates that ubiquitination of 
ciliary GPCRs is required for their regulated exit from cilia. Furthermore, 
targeting a UbK63-specific deubiquitinase to cilia blocks the exit of GPR161, 
SSTR3, and Smoothened (SMO) from cilia. Finally, ubiquitinated proteins 
accumulate in cilia of mammalian photoreceptors and Chlamydomonas cells when 
BBSome function is compromised. We conclude that Ub chains mark GPCRs and other 
unwanted ciliary proteins for recognition by the ciliary exit machinery.
