Coagulation factor X (FX) zymogen activation by factor IXa (FIXa) enzyme plays a 
critical role in the middle-phase of coagulation cascade. The activation process 
is catalytically inert and requires FIXa binding and complex formation with 
co-factor VIIIa (FVIIIa). In order to understand the structural details of the 
FVIIIa:FIXa complex, we employed knowledge-driven protein-protein docking and 
aqueous-phase MD refinement methods to develop a stable structural complex 
between FVIIIa and FIXa. The model shows that all four domains of FIXa wrap 
across FVIIIa that spans the co-factor binding surface of A2, A3 and C1 domains. 
The region surrounding the 558-helix of the A2-domain of FVIIIa is predicted to 
be the key interaction site with the helical segments of Lys293-Lys301 and 
Asp332-Arg338 residues of the serine-protease domain of FIXa. The hydrophobic 
helical stack between the GLA and EGF1 domains of FIXa is predicted to be 
primary interacting region with the A3-C2 domain interface of FVIIIa.
