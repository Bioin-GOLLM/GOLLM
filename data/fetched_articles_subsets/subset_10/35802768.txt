Metastatic prostate cancer in the bone induces bone-forming lesions that 
contribute to progression and therapy resistance. Prostate cancer-induced bone 
formation originates from endothelial cells (EC) that have undergone 
endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition in response to tumor-secreted 
BMP4. Current strategies targeting prostate cancer-induced bone formation are 
lacking. Here, we show that activation of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) inhibits 
EC-to-OSB transition and reduces prostate cancer-induced bone formation. 
Treatment with palovarotene, an RARγ agonist being tested for heterotopic 
ossification in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, inhibited EC-to-OSB 
transition and osteoblast mineralization in vitro and decreased tumor-induced 
bone formation and tumor growth in several osteogenic prostate cancer models, 
and similar effects were observed with the pan-RAR agonist all-trans-retinoic 
acid (ATRA). Knockdown of RARα, β, or γ isoforms in ECs blocked BMP4-induced 
EC-to-OSB transition and osteoblast mineralization, indicating a role for all 
three isoforms in prostate cancer-induced bone formation. Furthermore, treatment 
with palovarotene or ATRA reduced plasma Tenascin C, a factor secreted from 
EC-OSB cells, which may be used to monitor treatment response. Mechanistically, 
BMP4-activated pSmad1 formed a complex with RAR in the nucleus of ECs to 
activate EC-to-OSB transition. RAR activation by palovarotene or ATRA caused 
pSmad1 degradation by recruiting the E3-ubiquitin ligase Smad ubiquitination 
regulatory factor1 (Smurf1) to the nuclear pSmad1/RARγ complex, thus blocking 
EC-to-OSB transition. Collectively, these findings suggest that palovarotene can 
be repurposed to target prostate cancer-induced bone formation to improve 
clinical outcomes for patients with bone metastasis.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides mechanistic insights into how RAR agonists 
suppress prostate cancer-induced bone formation and offers a rationale for 
developing RAR agonists for prostate cancer bone metastasis therapy. See related 
commentary by Bhowmick and Bhowmick, p. 2975.
