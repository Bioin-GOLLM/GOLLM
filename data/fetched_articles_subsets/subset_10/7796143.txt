Immunocytochemical distribution of calbindin-D28K was examined in the brains of 
fetal sheep at 100-105 and 120-125 days of gestation (dGA) and at term in labor 
(term approximately 150 dGA) and compared to adult sheep. Brains were perfused, 
cut frozen and immunostained as freely floating sections with a polyclonal 
anti-calbindin-D28K antibody. Light microscopy revealed that calbindin-D28K 
immunogenicity in fetal cerebellum, rhombencephalon, mesencephalon, diencephalon 
and telencephalon was overall very similar to that seen in the brains of adult 
sheep. In addition even though fetal sheep peripheral plasma cortisol 
concentrations increase 10-20 times over the last 3-4 weeks of gestation to peak 
during labor and delivery, no glucocorticoid dependent increases in 
calbindin-D28K in the hippocampal formation could be seen in the sheep fetus as 
have been demonstrated for the adult rat given exogenous glucocorticoids. It is 
concluded that: (1) the basic pattern of calbindin-D28K distribution seen in 
adult sheep brains is established by at least 100 dGA in the sheep fetus; and 
(2) the pattern of calbindin-D28K expression in fetal sheep hippocampal 
formation is not related to peripheral plasma glucocorticoid concentrations.
