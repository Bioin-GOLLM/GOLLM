OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 
(MTHFR) gene C677T, factor V (FV) gene G1691A and prothrombin (PT) gene G20210A 
polymorphisms to unexplained recurrent early spontaneous abortion (URESA).
METHODS: One hundred and twelve patients with URESA and 100 women with at least 
1 normal pregnancy and without any miscarriage were analyzed for MTHFR, FV and 
PT gene polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
RESULTS: MTHFR gene T/T genotype and T allele frequencies were increased in 
URESA patients [38.4% (43/112) and 59.8% (134/224)] versus controls [18.0% 
(18/100) and 43% (43/100), P<0.01]. The patients carrying T/T genotype had a 
high risk of URESA (OR=2.8390, 95% CI: 1.5022 - 5.3661). However, FV and PT 
G20210A mutations were not found either in patients or in controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The genetic polymorphisms of MTHFR C677T are associated with URESA. 
It might indicate a genetic influence on pathogenesis of URESA. FV and PT gene 
mutations may be rare in Chinese women, and have no significance in URESA.
