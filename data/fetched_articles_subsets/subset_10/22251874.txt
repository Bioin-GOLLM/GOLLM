Genome-wide association studies have greatly improved our understanding of the 
genetic basis of disease risk. The fact that they tend not to identify more than 
a fraction of the specific causal loci has led to divergence of opinion over 
whether most of the variance is hidden as numerous rare variants of large effect 
or as common variants of very small effect. Here I review 20 arguments for and 
against each of these models of the genetic basis of complex traits and conclude 
that both classes of effect can be readily reconciled.
