Histone H2B monoubiquitination by Rad6/Bre1 is required for the trimethylation 
of both histone H3K4 and H3K79 by COMPASS and Dot1 methyltransferases, 
respectively. The dependency of methylation at H3K4 and H3K79 on the 
monoubiquitination of H2BK123 was recently challenged, and extragenic mutations 
in the strain background used for previous studies or epitope-tagged proteins 
were suggested to be the sources of this discrepancy. In this study, we show 
that H3K4 and H3K79 methylation is solely dependent on H2B monoubiquitination 
regardless of any additional alteration to the H2B sequence or genome. 
Furthermore, we report that Y131, one of the yeast histone H2A/H2B shuffle 
strains widely used for the last decade in the field of chromatin and 
transcription biology, carries a wild-type copy of each of the HTA2 and HTB2 
genes under the GAL1/10 promoter on chromosome II. Therefore, we generated the 
entire histone H2A and H2B alanine-scanning mutant strains in another 
background, which does not express wild-type histones.
