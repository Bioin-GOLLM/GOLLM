Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous virus belonging to the human -herpes 
virus subfamily. After primary infection, EBV maintains a life-long latent 
infection. A major concern is that EBV can cause a diverse range of neoplasms 
and autoimmune diseases. In addition, patients undergoing hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation or solid organ transplantation can experience 
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) due to dysfunction or 
suppression of host's immune system, or uncontrolled proliferation of 
EBV-infected cells. In recent years, the number of EBV-associated PTLD cases has 
increased. This review focuses on the current understandings of EBV-associated 
PTLD pathogenesis, as well as the risk factors and clinical outcomes for 
patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
