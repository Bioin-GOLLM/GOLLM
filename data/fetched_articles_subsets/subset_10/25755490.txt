We report a young man presenting with jaundice and severe debilitating 
intrahepatic cholestasis 7 months before the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity was not raised. Liver biopsy 
demonstrated deficiency of canalicular GGT and bile salt export pump expression, 
which suggested "benign" recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis. Direct sequencing 
of genomic DNA was therefore undertaken to look for mutations in ATP8B1 and 
ABCB11. Cholestasis and pruritus are well recognized presenting features of 
Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, striking in this case is that the intrahepatic 
cholestasis presented and resolved 7 months before the diagnosis. Furthermore, 4 
polymorphisms were identified in ATP8B1 in this patient-c.696T > C (rs319438), 
c.811A > C (rs319438), c.2855G > A (rs1296811) and c.3454G > A (rs222581)-and 
two polymorphisms in ABCB11-c.1331T > C (rs2287622) and c.3084A > G (rs497692); 
2 of which have been associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. We 
therefore postulate that these polymorphisms predisposed this patient to the 
development of intrahepatic cholestasis within the abnormal pro-inflammatory 
cytokine milieu typical for Hodgkin's lymphoma. This case shows for the first 
time that some polymorphisms in ABCB11 and ATP8B1 may predispose to the 
development of intrahepatic cholestasis in Hodgkin's lymphoma. It also 
demonstrates the importance of close clinical surveillance for the development 
of Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients presenting with unexplained intrahepatic 
cholestasis.
