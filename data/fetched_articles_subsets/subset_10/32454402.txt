BACKGROUND: The completeness of resection is a key prognostic indicator in 
patients with ovarian cancer, and the application of tumour-targeted 
fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) has led to improved detection of 
peritoneal metastases during cytoreductive surgery. CD24 is highly expressed in 
ovarian cancer and has been shown to be a suitable biomarker for tumour-targeted 
imaging.
METHODS: CD24 expression was investigated in cell lines and heterogenous 
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumour samples of high-grade serous ovarian 
carcinoma (HGSOC). After conjugation of the monoclonal antibody CD24 to the NIR 
dye Alexa Fluor 750 and the evaluation of the optimal pharmacological parameters 
(OV-90, n = 21), orthotopic HGSOC metastatic xenografts (OV-90, n = 16) 
underwent cytoreductive surgery with real-time feedback. The impact of 
intraoperative CD24-targeted fluorescence guidance was compared to white light 
and palpation alone, and the recurrence of disease was monitored 
post-operatively (OV-90, n = 12). CD24-AF750 was further evaluated in four 
clinically annotated orthotopic PDX models of metastatic HGSOC, to validate the 
translational potential for intraoperative guidance.
FINDINGS: CD24-targeted intraoperative NIR FIGS significantly (47•3%) improved 
tumour detection and resection, and reduced the post-operative tumour burden 
compared to standard white-light surgery in orthotopic HGSOC xenografts. 
CD24-AF750 allowed identification of minuscule tumour lesions which were 
undetectable with the naked eye in four HGSOC PDX.
INTERPRETATION: CD24-targeted FIGS has translational potential as an aid to 
improve debulking surgery of ovarian cancer.
