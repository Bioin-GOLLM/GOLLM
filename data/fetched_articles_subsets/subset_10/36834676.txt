Elucidation of the mechanisms for the response of cancer stem cells (CSCs) to 
radiation exposure is of considerable interest for further improvement of radio- 
and chemoradiotherapy of cervical cancer (CC). The aim of this work is to 
evaluate the effects of fractionated radiation exposure on the expression of 
vimentin, which is one of the end-stage markers of epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), and analyze its association with CSC radiation response and 
short-term prognosis of CC patients. The level of vimentin expression was 
determined in HeLa, SiHa cell lines, and scrapings from the cervix of 46 CC 
patients before treatment and after irradiation at a total dose of 10 Gy using 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, flow cytometry, and 
fluorescence microscopy. The number of CSCs was assessed using flow cytometry. 
Significant correlations were shown between vimentin expression and 
postradiation changes in CSC numbers in both cell lines (R = 0.88, p = 0.04 for 
HeLa and R = 0.91, p = 0.01 for SiHa) and cervical scrapings (R = 0.45, p = 
0.008). Associations were found at the level of tendency between postradiation 
increase in vimentin expression and unfavorable clinical outcome 3-6 months 
after treatment. The results clarify some of the relationships between EMT, 
CSCs, and therapeutic resistance that are needed to develop new strategies for 
cancer treatment.
