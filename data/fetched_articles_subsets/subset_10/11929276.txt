Several commercially available C-8 to C-24 saturated and unsaturated fatty acids 
(1-29) were assayed for cyclooxygenase-I (COX-I) and cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II) 
inhibitory and antioxidant activities. Among the saturated fatty acids tested at 
60 microg mL(-1), there was an increase in antioxidant activity with increasing 
chain length from octanoic acid to myristic acid (C-8-C-14) and a decrease 
thereafter. All unsaturated fatty acids tested at 60 microg mL(-1) showed good 
antioxidant activity except for undecylenic acid (12), cis-5-dodecenoic acid 
(13), and nervonic acid (29). The highest inhibitory activities among the 
saturated fatty acids tested on cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-I and COX-II were 
observed for decanoic acid to lauric acid (3-5) at 100 microg mL(-1). Similarly, 
among the unsaturated fatty acids tested, the highest activities were observed 
for cis-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid (25) and cis-13,16-docosadienoic acid (27) 
at 100 microg mL(-1).
