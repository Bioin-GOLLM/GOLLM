Clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX) is heavily hindered by DOX 
cardiotoxicity. Several theories were postulated for DOX cardiotoxicity 
including DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR), although the mechanism(s) 
involved remains to be elucidated. This study evaluated the potential role of 
TBC domain family member 15 (TBC1D15) in DOX cardiotoxicity. Tamoxifen-induced 
cardiac-specific Tbc1d15 knockout (Tbc1d15CKO) or Tbc1d15 knockin (Tbc1d15CKI) 
male mice were challenged with a single dose of DOX prior to cardiac assessment 
1 week or 4 weeks following DOX challenge. Adenoviruses encoding TBC1D15 or 
containing shRNA targeting Tbc1d15 were used for Tbc1d15 overexpression or 
knockdown in isolated primary mouse cardiomyocytes. Our results revealed that 
DOX evoked upregulation of TBC1D15 with compromised myocardial function and 
overt mortality, the effects of which were ameliorated and accentuated by 
Tbc1d15 deletion and Tbc1d15 overexpression, respectively. DOX overtly evoked 
apoptotic cell death, the effect of which was alleviated and exacerbated by 
Tbc1d15 knockout and overexpression, respectively. Meanwhile, DOX provoked 
mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, oxidative stress and DNA damage, the 
effects of which were mitigated and exacerbated by Tbc1d15 knockdown and 
overexpression, respectively. Further scrutiny revealed that TBC1D15 fostered 
cytosolic accumulation of the cardinal DDR element DNA-dependent protein kinase 
catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and 
co-immunoprecipitation denoted an interaction between TBC1D15 and DNA-PKcs at 
the segment 594-624 of TBC1D15. Moreover, overexpression of TBC1D15 mutant 
(∆594-624, deletion of segment 594-624) failed to elicit accentuation of 
DOX-induced cytosolic retention of DNA-PKcs, DNA damage and cardiomyocyte 
apoptosis by TBC1D15 wild type. However, Tbc1d15 deletion ameliorated 
DOX-induced cardiomyocyte contractile anomalies, apoptosis, mitochondrial 
anomalies, DNA damage and cytosolic DNA-PKcs accumulation, which were canceled 
off by DNA-PKcs inhibition or ATM activation. Taken together, our findings 
denoted a pivotal role for TBC1D15 in DOX-induced DNA damage, mitochondrial 
injury, and apoptosis possibly through binding with DNA-PKcs and thus 
gate-keeping its cytosolic retention, a route to accentuation of cardiac 
contractile dysfunction in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
