OBJECTIVES: We studied paediatric patients with human adenovirus (HAdV) 
infection during the 2011 outbreak in northern Taiwan to define the clinical 
features of different HAdV genotypes in children.
METHODS: Between January and December 2011, 637 patients <19 years of age 
exhibited culture-confirmed adenoviral infection in Chang Gung Memorial 
Hospital, and provided specimens available for genotyping by multiplex real-time 
PCR. Clinical data were collected retrospectively.
RESULTS: Excluding five cases with multiple genotypes, 632 cases were included 
for analysis. Three genotypes were identified, including HAdV-3 (429/632; 
67.6%), HAdV-7 (144/632; 22.6%) and HAdV-2 (59/632; 9.8%). Median age was 4.58 
years (range 2 months to 18 years), with children infected with HAdV-3 
significantly older (82.9% >3 years; p <0.001). Of the 621 inpatients, 98.2% had 
fevers and all exhibited respiratory symptoms, 75 patients (12.1%) had lower 
respiratory tract infections, 20 (3.2%) required intensive care (HAdV-2: 1; 
HAdV-3: 8; and HAdV-7: 11), and three died (all HAdV-7-infected). 
HAdV-3-infected patients were significantly more likely to have upper 
respiratory symptoms and a high serum C-reactive protein level >100 mg/L, 
whereas leucocytosis (white blood cell count >15 000/mm3) was more common in 
HAdV-2-infected patients (p 0.007). HAdV-7 infections were significantly 
associated with a longer duration of fever, leucopenia (white blood cell count 
<5000/mm3), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 000/mm3), lower respiratory 
tract infections, a longer length of hospital stay, and requiring intensive care 
(all p <0.001).
CONCLUSION: Childhood HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infections may exhibit different 
clinical manifestations. Although HAdV-3 was the most prevalent genotype 
observed during the 2011 Taiwan outbreak, HAdV-7 caused more severe disease 
characteristics and outcomes.
