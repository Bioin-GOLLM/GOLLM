Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a ubiquitous chaperone to interact with 
numerous proteins to regulate multiple cellular processes, especially during 
cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Hsp90 exists in a high level in 
tumor cells and tissues, and thus serves as a prognostic biomarker or 
therapeutic target in cancers. We herein report that Hsp90 is subjected to 
S-glutathionylation, a redox-dependent modification to form a disulfide bond 
between the tripeptide glutathione and cysteine residues of proteins, primarily 
at C366 and C412 in the presence of reactive oxygen species. The modification 
led to the loss of the ATPase activity. The level of Hsp90 was obviously reduced 
by S-glutathionylation, owing to C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein 
(CHIP)-mediated ubiquitin proteasome system. S-glutathionylation of Hsp90 was 
found to crosstalk with its C-terminal phosphorylation of Hsp90 that impedes the 
binding of Hsp90 with CHIP, demonstrating the importance of chaperone code in 
modulating Hsp90 function. Further biophysical analyses indicated that 
S-glutathionylation caused structural change of Hsp90, underlying the 
aforementioned functional regulation. Moreover, in accordance with the analysis 
of 64 samples collected from patients of breast cancer, the expression level of 
Hsp90 inversely correlated with the glutathionylated status of Hsp90. The ratio 
of total expression to glutathionylated status of Hsp90 was coherent to 
expression of biomarkers in breast cancer sample, potentiating the prognostic 
value in the cancer treatment.
