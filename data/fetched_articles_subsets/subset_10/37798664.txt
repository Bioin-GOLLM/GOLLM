BACKGROUND: Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by an IQ < 70, which 
implies below-average intellectual function and a lack of skills necessary for 
daily living. ID may occur due to multiple causes, such as metabolic, 
infectious, and chromosomal causes. ID affects approximately 1-3% of the 
population; however, the cause can be identified in only 25% of clinical 
patients.
METHODS: To find the cause of genetic ID in a family, we performed whole-exome 
sequencing and Sanger sequencing to confirm the presence of a SETBP1 variant and 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect SETBP1 expression in 
the proband and normal controls.
RESULTS: A novel variant, c.942_943insGT (p. Asp316TrpfsTer28), was found in 
SETBP1. Furthermore, we observed that SETBP1 expression in patients was only 20% 
that of normal controls (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A heterozygous variant in SETBP1 associated with ID was found. This 
report provides further evidence for its genetic basis and support for clinical 
genetic diagnosis.
