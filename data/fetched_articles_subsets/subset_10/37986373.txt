To investigate the causal relationship between dried fruit intake and frozen 
shoulder using Mendelian randomization (MR). Genome wide association studies 
were conducted to pool data and select genetic loci independently associated 
with dried fruit intake and frozen shoulder in people of European ancestry as 
instrumental variables. Three MR analyses, inverse variance weighting, weighted 
median and MR-Egger, were used to investigate the causal relationship between 
dried fruit intake and frozen shoulder. Heterogeneity and multiplicity tests 
were used, and sensitivity analyses were conducted using the leave-one-out 
method to explore the robustness of the results. The inverse variance weighting 
results showed an OR (95 % CI) of 0.52 (0.34-0.80), P = .003, suggesting that 
there is a causal relationship between dried fruit intake and frozen shoulder. 
And no heterogeneity and multiplicity were found by the test and sensitivity 
analysis also showed robust results. The present study used a two-sample MR 
analysis, and by analyzing and exploring the genetic data, the study showed that 
too little intake of dry fruits is a risk factor for developing frozen shoulder.
