Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup U, defined by the polymorphism 12308A>G, 
may constitute a risk factor for an occipital stroke in migraine. We therefore 
identified 14 patients with an occipital stroke and with 12308A>G. We determined 
complete mtDNA coding region sequence for the patients and for population 
controls by conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) and direct 
sequencing. Sequence information was used to construct a phylogenetic network of 
mtDNA haplogroups U and K, which was found to be composed of subclusters U2, U4, 
U5 and a new subcluster U7, as well as cluster K. Five patients with a 
migrainous stroke belonged to subcluster U5 (P=0.006; Fisher's exact test). Many 
unique mutations were found among the patients with an occipital stroke 
including two tRNA mutations that have previously been suggested to be 
pathogenic. Analysis of mtDNA sequences by CSGE and comparison of the sequences 
through phylogenetic analysis greatly enhances the identification of mtDNA 
clusters in population and detection of mtDNA mutations in patients.
