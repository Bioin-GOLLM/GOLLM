The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCC4 (multidrug resistance protein 4, 
MRP4) mRNA level is a strong predictor of poor clinical outcome in neuroblastoma 
which may relate to its export of endogenous signalling molecules and 
chemotherapeutic agents. We sought to determine whether ABCC4 contributes to 
development, growth and drug response in neuroblastoma in vivo. In neuroblastoma 
patients, high ABCC4 protein levels were associated with reduced overall 
survival. Inducible knockdown of ABCC4 strongly inhibited the growth of human 
neuroblastoma cells in vitro and impaired the growth of neuroblastoma 
xenografts. Loss of Abcc4 in the Th-MYCN transgenic neuroblastoma mouse model 
did not impact tumour formation; however, Abcc4-null neuroblastomas were 
strongly sensitised to the ABCC4 substrate drug irinotecan. Our findings 
demonstrate a role for ABCC4 in neuroblastoma cell proliferation and 
chemoresistance and provide rationale for a strategy where inhibition of ABCC4 
should both attenuate the growth of neuroblastoma and sensitise tumours to ABCC4 
chemotherapeutic substrates.
