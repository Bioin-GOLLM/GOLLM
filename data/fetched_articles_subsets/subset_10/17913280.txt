Polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair genes have been associated with risk 
for lung cancer. We examined gene-environment interactions in relation to lung 
cancer in 430 cases and 790 comparison persons identified within a prospective 
cohort of 57,053 persons. We included polymorphisms in the XPC, XPA and XPD 
genes involved in the nucleotide excision DNA repair pathway and analysed 
possible interactions with smoking and dietary intake of fruit and vegetables in 
relation to risk for lung cancer. We found that intake of fruit was associated 
with lower risk for lung cancer only among carriers of the XPA A23G variant 
genotype. The incidence rate ratio for lung cancer was 0.60 (95% confidence 
interval: 0.43-0.84; p=0.003) per 50% increase in fruit intake. No convincing 
interactions were detected between the polymorphisms and smoking.
