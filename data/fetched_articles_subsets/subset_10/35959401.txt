BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a complex neurological disease affected by 
genetics and environment. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) is involved in 
extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, inflammation and angiogenesis to 
regulate the development and recovery of IS.
PURPOSES: The aim of this study was to explore the association of rs1053605, 
rs243849 and rs14070 in MMP2 with the risk of IS in Chinese Shaanxi population.
METHODS: In this study, 677 IS patients and 681 normal controls were recruited. 
Rs1053605, rs243849 and rs14070 in MMP2 were genotyped. Logistic regression 
analysis was applied to evaluate the association of rs1053605, rs243849 and 
rs14070 in MMP2 with IS susceptibility and the association of environmental 
factors with MMP2 genetic susceptibility to IS.
RESULTS: The results of the overall analysis demonstrated that rs14070 in MMP2 
significantly reduced the risk of IS in Chinese Shaanxi population (OR = 0.767, 
95% CI = 0.619-0.952, P = 0.016). Subgroup analysis illustrated that rs243849 in 
MMP2 evidently increased the risk of IS among drinkers, while rs14070 in MMP2 
apparently reduced IS susceptibility among females, participants with aged >55, 
smokers and drinkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, rs243849 and rs14070 in MMP2 were significantly 
associated with the risk of IS in Chinese Shaanxi population, and the effect of 
MMP2 to IS may be associated with its genetic susceptibility.
