An 8-year-old boy is described with borderline cognitive impairment, cerebellar 
hypoplasia, a stroke-like episode, and venous thrombosis of the left leg after a 
period of immobilization. The pattern of multiple abnormalities in blood 
coagulation suggested carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type 1a. 
Isoelectric focusing of serum transferrin was abnormal. The activity of 
phosphomannomutase in leukocytes and fibroblasts was decreased. Mutation 
analysis of the PMM2 gene revealed the R141H/E151G genotype. These results 
confirm the presence of carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type 1a 
without severe psychomotor retardation.
