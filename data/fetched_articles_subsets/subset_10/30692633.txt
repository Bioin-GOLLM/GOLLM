Aside from its well-known nuclear routes of signaling, estrogen also mediates 
its effects through cytoplasmic signaling. Estrogen signaling involves numerous 
posttranslational modifications of its receptor ERα, the best known being 
phosphorylation. Our research group previously showed that upon estrogen 
stimulation, ERα is methylated on residue R260 and forms the mERα/Src/PI3K 
complex, central to the rapid transduction of nongenomic estrogen signals. 
Regulation of ERα signaling via its phosphorylation by growth factors is well 
recognized, and we wondered whether they could also trigger ERα methylation 
(mERα). Here, we found that IGF-1 treatment of MCF-7 cells induced rapid ERα 
methylation by the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 and triggered the binding of 
mERα to IGF-1R. Mechanistically, we showed that PRMT1 bound constitutively to 
IGF-1R and that PRMT1 became activated upon IGF-1 stimulation. Moreover, we 
found that expression or pharmacological inhibition of PRMT1 impaired mERα and 
IGF-1 signaling. Our findings were substantiated in a cohort of breast tumors in 
which IGF-1R expression was positively correlated with ERα/Src and ERα/PI3K 
expression, hallmarks of nongenomic estrogen signaling, reinforcing the link 
between IGF-1R and mERα. Altogether, these results provide a new insight into 
ERα and IGF-1R interference, and open novel perspectives for combining endocrine 
therapies with PRMT1 inhibitors in ERα-positive tumors.
