The role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers such as CSF α-synuclein and CSF 
tau in predicting cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) continues to be 
inconsistent. Here, using a cohort of de novo PD patients with preserved 
cognition from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), we show 
that the SNCA rs356181 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) modulates the effect 
of these CSF biomarkers on cortical thinning. Depending on this SNP's genotype, 
cortical atrophy was associated with either higher or lower CSF biomarker 
levels. Additionally, this SNP modified age-related atrophy. Importantly, the 
integrity of the brain regions where this phenomenon was observed correlated 
with cognitive measures. These results suggest that this genetic variation of 
the gene encoding the α-synuclein protein, known to be involved in the 
development of PD, also interferes in its subsequent neurodegeneration. Overall, 
our findings could shed light on the so far incongruent association of common 
CSF biomarkers with cognitive decline in PD.
