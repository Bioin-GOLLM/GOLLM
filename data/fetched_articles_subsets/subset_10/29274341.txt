Histone H2B monoubiquitination plays a critical role in the regulation of gene 
transcription. Deregulation of H2B monoubiquitination contributes to human 
pathologies, such as cancer. Here we report that human USP36 is a novel H2Bub1 
deubiquitinase. We show that USP36 interacts with H2B and deubiquitinates H2Bub1 
in cells and in vitro. Overexpression of USP36 markedly reduced the levels of 
H2Bub1 in cells. Using the p21 gene as a model, we demonstrate that depletion of 
USP36 increases H2Bub1 at the p21 locus, primarily within its gene body. 
Consistently, knockdown of USP36 induced the expression of p21 and inhibits cell 
proliferation. Together, our results reveal USP36 as a novel H2B deubiquitinase 
and shed light on its additional functions in regulating gene expression.
