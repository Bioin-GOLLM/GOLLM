Several presynaptic proteins involved in neurotransmitter release in the CNS 
have been implicated in schizophrenia in human clinical genetic studies, in 
postmortem studies, and in studies of putative animal models of schizophrenia. 
The presynaptic protein RIM1alpha mediates presynaptic plasticity and cognitive 
function. We now demonstrate that mice deficient in RIM1alpha exhibit 
abnormalities in multiple schizophrenia-relevant behavioral tasks including 
prepulse inhibition, response to psychotomimetic drugs, and social interaction. 
These schizophrenia-relevant behavioral findings are relatively selective to 
RIM1alpha-deficient mice, as mice bearing mutations in the RIM1alpha binding 
partners Rab3A or synaptotagmin 1 only show decreased prepulse inhibition. In 
addition to RIM1alpha's involvement in multiple behavioral abnormalities, these 
data suggest that alterations in presynaptic forms of short-term plasticity are 
linked to alterations in prepulse inhibition, a measure of sensorimotor gating.
