Two hexapeptide analogues of Substance P (6-11) have been synthesized. 
Replacement of Gly9 by proline provides a peptide with tenfold enhanced 
selectivity for the NK-1 receptor. The corresponding proline-containing 
glycopeptide incorporating a beta-D-glucopyranosyl residue linked to the 
side-chain of Glu6 was 100 times more selective than Substance P for the same 
receptor.
