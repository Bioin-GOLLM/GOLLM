Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a hereditary disease and 
common renal disease. Mutations of PKD genes are responsible for this disease. 
We analyzed a large Chinese family with ADPKD using Sanger sequencing to 
identify the mutation responsible for this disease. The family comprised 27 
individuals including 10 ADPKD patients. These ADPKD patients had severe renal 
disease and most of them died very young. We analyzed 6 survival patients gene 
and found they all had C10529T mutation in exon 35 of PKD1 gene. We did not 
found gene mutation in any unaffected relatives or 300 unrelated controls. These 
findings suggested that the C10529T mutation in PKD1 gene might be the 
pathogenic mutation responsible for the disease in this family.
