Bacteriophage research has been instrumental to advancing many fields of 
biology, such as genetics, molecular biology, and synthetic biology. Many 
phage-derived technologies have been adapted for building gene circuits to 
program biological systems. Phages also exhibit significant medical potential as 
antibacterial agents and bacterial diagnostics due to their extreme specificity 
for their host, and our growing ability to engineer them further enhances this 
potential. Phages have also been used as scaffolds for genetically programmable 
biomaterials that have highly tunable properties. Furthermore, phages are 
central to powerful directed evolution platforms, which are being leveraged to 
enhance existing biological functions and even produce new ones. In this review, 
we discuss recent examples of how phage research is influencing these 
next-generation biotechnologies.
