Potato invertase inhibitor (StInvInh2) positively regulates cold-induced 
sweetening (CIS) resistance by inhibiting the activity of vacuolar invertase. 
The distinct expression patterns of StInvInh2 have been thoroughly characterized 
in different potato genotypes, but the related CIS ability has not been 
characterized. The understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that control 
StInvInh2 transcription is unclear. In this study, we identified an ERF-VII 
transcription factor, StRAP2.3, that directly regulates StInvInh2 to positively 
modulate CIS resistance. Acting as a nuclear-localized transcriptional 
activator, StRAP2.3 directly binds the ACCGAC cis-element in the promoter region 
of StInvInh2, enabling promoter activity. Overexpression of StRAP2.3 in 
CIS-sensitive potato tubers induced StInvInh2 mRNA abundance and increased CIS 
resistance. In contrast, silencing StRAP2.3 in CIS-resistant potato tubers 
repressed the expression of StInvInh2 and decreased CIS resistance. We conclude 
that cold-responsive StInvInh2 is due to the binding of StRAP2.3 to the ACCGAC 
cis-element in the promoter region of StInvInh2. Overall, these findings 
indicate that StRAP2.3 directly regulates StInvInh2 to positively modulate CIS 
resistance, which may provide a strategy to improve the processing quality of 
potatoes.
