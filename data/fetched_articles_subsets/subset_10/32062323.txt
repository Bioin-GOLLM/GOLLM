PURPOSE: To investigate the expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) and 
markers of mTOR pathway in paediatric glioneuronal tumours and correlate these 
findings with tumour type, BRAFV600E mutational status and clinical 
characteristics such as tumour location, seizure frequency and duration, and 
age.
METHOD: 37 children and adolescents with a neuropathological diagnosis of 
glioneuronal tumour were identified over a 22-year period. Immunohistochemical 
analyses for SSTRs type 1, 2A, 3, 5 and ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) and 
phosphorylated S6 (pS6), which are indicators of mTOR pathway activation, were 
performed in tumour specimens from 33 patients and evaluated using the 
immunoreactive score (IRS). The IRS were compared to tumour type, BRAFV600E 
status and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Ganglioglioma (GG) was the most frequently encountered subgroup (n = 
27), followed by dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour (DNET; n = 4). GGs 
expressed SSTR2A and SSTR3 to a high extent, 56 % and 44 % respectively. 
Expression of SSTR2A was also found in DNETs. Signs of mTOR pathway activation 
were abundant in GGs, but only present in one DNET. No correlations with 
BRAFV600E presence or clinical characteristics were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of SSTRs and activation of mTOR pathway in paediatric 
glioneuronal tumour suggest that somatostatin analogues and mTOR inhibitors may 
have potential therapeutic implications in a subset of inoperable childhood 
glioneuronal tumours causing medically refractory epilepsy and/or tumour growth. 
Further clinical studies are warranted to validate these findings.
