Innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) due to the increasing size of the aging population and the lack of 
effective drug treatment. Here, we report the therapeutic effects of 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by microglia, including macrosomes and 
small EVs, on AD-associated pathology. Macrosomes strongly inhibited β-amyloid 
(Aβ) aggregation and rescued cells from Aβ misfolding-induced cytotoxicity. 
Furthermore, macrosome administration reduced Aβ plaques and ameliorated 
cognitive impairment in mice with AD. In contrast, small EVs slightly promoted 
Aβ aggregation and did not improve AD pathology. Proteomic analysis of small EVs 
and macrosomes revealed that macrosomes harbor several important neuroprotective 
proteins that inhibit Aβ misfolding. In particular, the small integral membrane 
protein 10-like protein 2B in macrosomes has been shown to inhibit Aβ 
aggregation. Our observations provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for 
the treatment of AD over conventional ineffective drug treatments.
