BACKGROUND: Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a genetic disorder caused by 
variants in cohesion genes including NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and HDAC8. 
According to the 2018 consensus statement, a patient with clinical scored ≥ 11 
points could be diagnosed as CdLS. However, some variants in non-cohesion genes 
rather than cohesion genes can manifest as phenotypes of CdLS.
OBJECTIVES: This study describes six variants of non-cohesion genes (KDM6A, 
KMT2D, KMT2A ANKRD11, and UBE2A), and assesses the reliability of 11-points 
scale criteria in the clinical diagnosis of CdLS.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on six patients with 
features of CdLS. Phenotypic and genotypic spectra of 40 previously reported 
patients with features of CdLS caused by non-cohesion genes variants and 34 
previously reported patients with NIPBL variants were summarized. Clinical score 
comparison among patients with NIPBL variants versus those with variants in 
non-cohesin genes was performed.
RESULTS: Variants in non-cohesion genes were found in six patients [KMT2A (n = 
2), KMT2D, ANKRD11, KDM6A, and UBE2A]. Of them, four variants (KMT2A c.7789C > 
T, ANKRD11 c.1757_1776del, KDM6A c.655-1G > A, and UBE2A c.439C > T) were novel. 
Combining with previously reported cases, 46 patients with phenotypes of CdLS 
caused by variants in 20 non-cohesion genes are now reported. From this total 
cohort, the average clinical score of patients in ANKRD11 cohort, SETD5 cohort, 
and AFF4 cohort was statistically lower than those in NIPBL cohort (8.92 ± 1.77 
vs. 12.23 ± 2.58, 7.33 ± 2.52 vs. 12.23 ± 2.58, 5.33 ± 1.53 vs. 12.23 ± 2.58; p 
< 0.05). The average clinical score of KMT2A cohort, EP300 cohort, and NIPBL 
cohort had not significantly different from (11 ± 2.19 vs. 12.23 ± 2.58, 10 ± 
4.58 vs. 12.23 ± 2.58; p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: We described 4 novel variants of non-cohesion genes in six Chinese 
patients with phenotypes of CdLS. Of note, three genes (KMT2D, KDM6A, and UBE2A) 
causing features of CdLS have never been reported. The proposed clinical 
criteria for CdLS needed to be updated and refined, insofar as WES was necessary 
to confirm the diagnosis of CdLS. Our study expanded the spectra of non-cohesion 
genetic variations in patients with features of CdLS.
