BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed a differential distribution of the four 
regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinases inside the brain, that 
changed in rodent gliomas: therefore, the distribution of these proteins inside 
the brain can give information on the functional state of the cells. Our goal 
was to examine human brain tumors to provide evidence for a differential 
distribution of protein kinase A in different tumors.
METHODS: The distribution of detergent insoluble regulatory (R1 and R2) and 
catalytic subunits of cAMP dependent kinases was examined in pediatric brain 
tumors by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent cAMP analogues binding.
RESULTS: R2 is organized in large single dots in medulloblastomas, while it has 
a different appearance in other tumors. Fluorescent cAMP labelling was observed 
only in medulloblastoma.
CONCLUSIONS: A different distribution of cAMP dependent protein kinases has been 
observed in medulloblastoma.
