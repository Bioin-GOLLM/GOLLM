Currently, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is recognized as the extracellular 
messenger that acts through P2 receptors. P2 receptors are divided into two 
subtypes: P2Y metabotropic receptors and P2X ionotropic receptors, both of which 
are found in virtually all mammalian cell types studied. Due to the difficulty 
in studying membrane protein structures by X-ray crystallography or NMR 
techniques, there is little information about these structures available in the 
literature. Two structures of the P2X4 receptor in truncated form have been 
solved by crystallography. Molecular modeling has proven to be an excellent tool 
for studying ionotropic receptors. Recently, modeling studies carried out on P2X 
receptors have advanced our knowledge of the P2X receptor structure-function 
relationships. This review presents a brief history of ion channel structural 
studies and shows how modeling approaches can be used to address relevant 
questions about P2X receptors.
