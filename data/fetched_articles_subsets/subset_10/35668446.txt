BACKGROUND: Variants in the CASK gene result in a wide range of observed 
phenotypes in humans, such as FG Syndrome 4 and intellectual disabilities. 
Intellectual developmental disorder with microcephaly and pontine and cerebellar 
hypoplasia (MICPCH) is an X-linked disorder that affects females and is 
characterized by severely impaired intellectual development and variable degrees 
of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Variants in CASK are the main genetic cause of 
MICPCH. Variants in CASK can explain most patients with MICPCH, but there are 
still some patients whose disease aetiology cannot be explained.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 11-month-old female diagnosed with MICPCH exhibited 
general developmental delays, microcephaly, and cerebellar hypoplasia. 
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used to find a novel heterozygous missense 
variant (NM_003688.3: c.638T>G) of CASK in this patient. Strikingly, this 
variant reduced the expression of CASK at the protein level but not at the mRNA 
level. By using protein structure prediction analysis, this study found that the 
amino acid change caused by the variant resulted in further changes in the 
stability of the protein structure, and these changes caused the downregulation 
of protein expression and loss of protein function.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we first reported a novel heterozygous pathogenic 
variant and a causative mechanism of MICPCH. The amino acid change cause by this 
variant led to changes in the protein structure and a decrease in its stability, 
which caused a loss of protein function. This study could be helpful to the 
genetic diagnosis of this disease.
