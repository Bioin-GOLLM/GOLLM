Despite advanced diseases continuing to be associated with grim prognoses, the 
past decade has witnessed the advent of several novel treatment options for 
cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) patients. In fact, CCA has emerged as a heterogeneous 
group of malignancies harboring potentially druggable mutations in approximately 
50% of cases, and thus, molecularly targeted therapies have been actively 
explored in this setting. Among these, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 
inhibitors have reported important results, as witnessed by the FDA approval of 
pemigatinib in previously treated metastatic CCA patients harboring FGFR2 fusion 
or other rearrangements. Herein, we provide an overview of available evidence on 
FGFR inhibitors in CCA, especially focusing on the development, pitfalls and 
challenges of emerging treatments in this setting.
