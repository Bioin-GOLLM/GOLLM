BRAFV600E mutation is frequently observed in melanoma, and contributes to tumor 
malignancy. Despite inhibition of BRAF causes a profound cell growth inhibition 
and a strong clinical benefit in BRAFV600E melanoma, acquired drug resistance is 
still the major hurdle. In this study, we demonstrate that BRAFV600E drives cell 
growth and glycolysis in melanoma cells but does so by a previously 
unappreciated mechanism that involves direct induction of Skp2. Skp2 is highly 
expressed in melanoma tissues and particularly in tissues with BRAFV600E 
mutation. The inhibition of BRAFV600E by either siRNA or inhibitor vemurafenib 
suppressed Skp2 expression and cell growth. Mechanistic study shows that 
BRAFV600E suppression of Skp2 is dependent on c-Myc transcription factor via 
specifically bounding to the E-box region on SKP2 promoter. Further, the 
overexpression of Skp2 resulted in a markedly increase in cell growth, cell 
cycle progression and glycolysis which were repressed by BRAFV600E inhibition. 
Supporting the biological significance, Skp2 is specifically correlated with 
poor patient outcome in BRAFV600E but did not in BRAFWT melanomas. Thus, as a 
downstream target of BRAFV600E, Skp2 is critical for responses to BRAF 
inhibition, indicating targeting Skp2 might be a promising strategy for the 
treatment of BRAFi resistant melanomas.
