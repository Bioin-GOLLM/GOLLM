The barrier to curing Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) is thought to reside in 
a lack of understanding in the roles and regulations of peripheral inflammatory 
immune cells. Here we perform a single-cell multi-omic study of 166,149 cells in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with VKH, profile the chromatin 
accessibility and gene expression in the same blood samples, and uncover 
prominent cellular heterogeneity. Immune cells in VKH blood are highly activated 
and pro-inflammatory. Notably, we describe an enrichment of transcription 
targets for nuclear factor kappa B in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) that 
governed inflammation. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin maps 
shows that the RELA in cDCs is related to disease complications and poor 
prognosis. Ligand-receptor interaction pairs also identify cDC as an important 
predictor that regulated multiple immune subsets. Our results reveal epigenetic 
and transcriptional dynamics in auto-inflammation, especially the cDC subtype 
that might lead to therapeutic strategies in VKH.
