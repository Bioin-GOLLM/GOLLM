Detailed and systematic examination of high-resolution structural data is a 
rational strategy for understanding the function of biological macromolecules. G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are an exceptionally valuable superfamily of 
proteins for such analysis. The most intriguing question is how a variety of 
extracellular stimuli evoke structural changes in the intracellular surface of 
the receptors. The recent active-like crystal structures of GPCRs provide 
information for uncovering common and distinct mechanisms of light-induced and 
ligand-induced activation. Based on systematic structural alignment, we have 
analyzed 3 receptors (rhodopsin, Î²2 adrenergic receptor, adenosine A2A receptor) 
and demonstrate that the extracellular movement of helix VI is significantly 
different between rhodopsin and the other 2 receptors, and that the 
extracellular side of helix III exhibits distinct features in the 3 receptors. 
These findings not only emphasize the specialization of rhodopsin as a 
photoreceptor but also provide insights into the mechanism leading to 
rearrangement of helix VI.
