BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies have reported that the single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) of SAMM50-rs738491, PARVB-rs5764455 and PNPLA3-rs738409 are 
associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, no studies 
have examined the effect of interactions between these three genotypes to affect 
liver disease severity. We assessed the effect of these three SNPs on 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and also examined the gene-gene interactions 
in a Chinese population with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD.
METHODS: We enrolled 415 consecutive adult individuals with biopsy-proven NAFLD. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was undertaken to test associations 
between NASH and SNPs in SAMM50-rs738491, PARVB-rs5764455 and PNPLA3-rs738409. 
Gene-gene interactions were analyzed by performing a generalized multifactor 
dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analysis.
RESULTS: The mean ± standard deviation age of these 415 patients was 41.3±12.5 
years, and 75.9% were men. Patients with SAMM50-rs738491 TT, PARVB-rs5764455 AA 
or PNPLA3-rs738409 GG genotypes had a higher risk of NASH, even after adjustment 
for age, sex and body mass index. GMDR analysis showed that the combination of 
all three SNPs was the best model for predicting NASH. Additionally, the odds 
ratio of the haplotype T-A-G for predicting the risk of NASH was nearly three 
times higher than that of the haplotype G-C-C.
CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD patients carrying the SAMM50-rs738491 TT, PARVB-rs5764455 AA 
or PNPLA3-rs738409 GG genotypes are at greater risk of NASH. These three SNPs 
may synergistically interact to increase susceptibility to NASH.
