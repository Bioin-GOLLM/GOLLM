Unresectable glioblastoma (GBM) cells in the invading tumor edge can act as 
seeds for recurrence. The molecular and phenotypic properties of these cells 
remain elusive. Here, we report that the invading edge and tumor core have two 
distinct types of glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) that resemble proneural (PN) and 
mesenchymal (MES) subtypes, respectively. Upon exposure to ionizing radiation 
(IR), GSCs, initially enriched for a CD133+ PN signature, transition to a CD109+ 
MES subtype in a C/EBP-β-dependent manner. Our gene expression analysis of 
paired cohorts of patients with primary and recurrent GBMs identified a 
CD133-to-CD109 shift in tumors with an MES recurrence. Patient-derived 
CD133-/CD109+ cells are highly enriched with clonogenic, tumor-initiating, and 
radiation-resistant properties, and silencing CD109 significantly inhibits these 
phenotypes. We also report a conserved regulation of YAP/TAZ pathways by CD109 
that could be a therapeutic target in GBM.
