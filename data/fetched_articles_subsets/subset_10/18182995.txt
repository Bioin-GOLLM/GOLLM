Experimental evidence suggests that ageing-associated alterations in the tissue 
microenvironment act to promote prostate carcinogenesis. In this review, we 
survey the cellular state of senescence, review its causes, and describe 
associations with ageing and cancer. We further discuss senescent stromal gene 
expression changes, which may mediate these effects, and that may serve as 
therapeutic targets.
