Translation of cellular RNA to protein is an energy-intensive process through 
which synthesized proteins dictate cellular processes and function. Translation 
is regulated in response to extracellular effectors and availability of amino 
acids intracellularly. Most eukaryotic mRNA rely on the methyl 7-guanosine (m7G) 
nucleotide cap to recruit the translation machinery, and the uncoupling of 
translational control that occurs in tumorigenesis plays a significant role in 
cancer treatment response. This article provides an overview of the mammalian 
translation initiation process and the primary mechanisms by which it is 
regulated. An outline of how deregulation of initiation supports tumorigenesis 
and how initiation at a downstream open reading frame (ORF) of Tousled-like 
kinase 1 (TLK1) leads to treatment resistance is discussed.
