BACKGROUND: Left ventricle rotation and torsion are fundamental components of 
myocardial function, and several software packages have been developed for 
analysis of these components. The purpose of this study was to compare the 
suitability of two software packages with different technical principles for 
analysis of rotation and torsion of the left ventricle during systole.
METHODS: A group of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients (N = 14, age 
43 ± 11 years), mutation carriers without hypertrophy (N = 10, age 
34 ± 13 years), and healthy relatives (N = 12, age 43 ± 17 years) underwent a 
cardiovascular magnetic resonance examination, including spatial modulation of 
magnetization tagging sequences in basal and apical planes of the left 
ventricle. The tagging images were analyzed offline using a harmonic phase image 
analysis method with Gabor filtering and a non-rigid registration-based 
free-form deformation technique. Left-ventricle rotation and torsion scores were 
obtained from end-diastole to end-systole with both software.
RESULTS: Analysis was successful in all cases with both software applications. 
End-systolic torsion values between the study groups were not statistically 
different with either software. End-systolic apical rotation, end-systolic basal 
rotation, and end-systolic torsion were consistently higher when analyzed with 
non-rigid registration than with harmonic phase-based analysis (p <  0.0001). 
End-systolic rotation and torsion values had significant correlations between 
the two software (p <  0.0001), most significant in the apical plane.
CONCLUSIONS: When comparing absolute values of rotation and torsion between 
different individuals, software-specific reference values are required. Harmonic 
phase flow with Gabor filtering and non-rigid registration-based methods can 
both be used reliably in the analysis of systolic rotation and torsion patterns 
of the left ventricle.
