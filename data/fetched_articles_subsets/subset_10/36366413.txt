The aim of the present study was to evaluate CD4/CD8 dynamics in patients on 
dolutegravir (DTG)-based two-drug regimens (2DRs) and compare them with 
DTG-containing triple-drug regimens (3DRs). A prospective observational study 
was performed in the context of the SCOLTA cohort. Experienced PWH with HIV-RNA 
< 50 copies/mL were included if they were on the DTG-2DR, the DTG + 
tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) regimen, the DTG + tenofovir alafenamide 
(TAF)/FTC regimen, or the DTG + abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) regimen; they were 
followed-up for at least one year. A total of 533 PWH were enrolled, 120 in the 
DTG + 3TC group, 38 in the DTG + protease inhibitors (PI) group, 67 in the DTG + 
rilpivirine (RPV) group, 49 in the DTG + TDF/FTC group, 27 in the DTG + TAF/FTC 
group, and 232 in the DTG + ABC/3TC group. After one year, the CD4/CD8 ratio 
significantly increased in the PWH treated with DTG + 3TC (+0.08 ± 0.26), DTG + 
TDF/FTC (+0.1 ± 0.19), and DTG + ABC/3TC (+0.08 ± 0.25). At two years, the 
CD4/CD8 increase was confirmed for PWH on DTG + TDF/FTC (+0.16 ± 0.28) and DTG + 
ABC/3TC (+0.1 ± 0.3). In the SCOLTA cohort, PWH on 2DRs experienced a CD4/CD8 
increase only in the DTG + 3TC group. Controlled studies with longer follow-up 
will clarify the long-term immunological and clinical impacts of DTG-2DR.
