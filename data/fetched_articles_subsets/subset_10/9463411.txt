The formation of the repertoire of mouse natural killer (NK) cell receptors for 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules was investigated by 
determining the developmental pattern of Ly49 receptor expression. During the 
first days after birth, few or no splenic NK cells express Ly49A, Ly49C, Ly49G2, 
or Ly49I receptors. The proportion of Ly49+ splenic NK cells gradually rises to 
adult levels during the first 6-8 wk of life. The appearance of appreciable 
numbers of splenic Ly49+ NK cells coincides with the appearance of NK activity 
at 3-4 wk. After in vivo transfer, NK cells not expressing specific Ly49 
receptors can give rise to NK cells that do, and cells expressing one of these 
four Ly49 receptors can give rise to cells expressing others. Once initiated, 
expression of a Ly49 receptor is stable for at least 10 d after in vivo 
transfer. Hence, initiation of Ly49 receptor expression occurs successively. 
Interestingly, expression of one of the receptors tested, Ly49A, did not occur 
after in vivo transfer of Ly49A- cells. One possible explanation for these data 
is that the order of Ly49 receptor expression by NK cells is nonrandom. The 
results provide a framework for evaluating models of NK cell repertoire 
formation, and how the repertoire is molded by host class I MHC molecules.
