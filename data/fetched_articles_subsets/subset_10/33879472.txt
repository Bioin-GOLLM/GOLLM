CONTEXT: Despite the advantages of ultrasound (US), upper gastrointestinal 
contrast series (UGI) remains the first-line diagnostic modality in the 
diagnosis of midgut malrotation and volvulus in children.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of US in the diagnosis of 
malrotation with or without volvulus in children and adolescents aged 0-21 
years, compared with the reference standard (diagnosis by surgery, UGI, CT, MRI, 
and clinical follow-up individually or as a composite).
DATA SOURCES: We searched the electronic databases Ovid-MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, 
CINAHL, and the Cochrane library in October 2019 and updated on 18 August 2020.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of US for 
diagnosis of midgut malrotation with or without volvulus in children (0-21 
years).
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The data were extracted independently by two 
authors and a bivariate model was used for synthesis.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 17 cohort or cross-sectional studies and 2257 
participants estimated a summary sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 89% to 97%) and 
summary specificity of 100% (95% CI 97% to 100%) (moderate certainty evidence) 
for the use of US for the diagnosis of malrotation with or without midgut 
volvulus compared with the reference standard. Subgroup analysis and 
meta-regression revealed better diagnostic accuracy in malrotation not 
complicated by volvulus, in the neonatal population and enteric fluid 
administration before US.
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate certainty evidence suggests excellent diagnostic accuracy 
and coupled with the advantages, a strong case exists for the use of abdominal 
US as the first-line diagnostic test for suspected midgut malrotation with or 
without volvulus in children and adolescents.
