BACKGROUND: There is current expansion of newborn screening (NBS) programs to 
include lysosomal storage disorders because of the availability of treatments 
that produce an optimal clinical outcome when started early in life.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a multiplex-tandem mass spectrometry 
(MS/MS) enzymatic activity assay of 6 lysosomal enzymes in a NBS laboratory for 
the identification of newborns at risk for developing Pompe, 
Mucopolysaccharidosis-I (MPS-I), Fabry, Gaucher, Niemann Pick-A/B, and Krabbe 
diseases.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Enzyme activities (acid α-glucosidase (GAA), 
galactocerebrosidase (GALC), glucocerebrosidase (GBA), α-galactosidase A (GLA), 
α-iduronidase (IDUA) and sphingomyeline phosphodiesterase-1 (SMPD-1)) were 
measured on ~43,000 de-identified dried blood spot (DBS) punches, and screen 
positive samples were submitted for DNA sequencing to obtain genotype 
confirmation of disease risk. The 6-plex assay was efficiently performed in the 
Washington state NBS laboratory by a single laboratory technician at the bench 
using a single MS/MS instrument. The number of screen positive samples per 
100,000 newborns were as follows: GAA (4.5), IDUA (13.6), GLA (18.2), SMPD1 
(11.4), GBA (6.8), and GALC (25.0).
DISCUSSION: A 6-plex MS/MS assay for 6 lysosomal enzymes can be successfully 
performed in a NBS laboratory. The analytical ranges (enzyme-dependent assay 
response for the quality control HIGH sample divided by that for all 
enzyme-independent processes) for the 6-enzymes with the MS/MS is 5- to 15-fold 
higher than comparable fluorimetric assays using 4-methylumbelliferyl 
substrates. The rate of screen positive detection is consistently lower for the 
MS/MS assay compared to the fluorimetric assay using a digital microfluidics 
platform.
