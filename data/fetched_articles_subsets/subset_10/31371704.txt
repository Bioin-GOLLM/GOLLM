Targeted protein degradation is a promising drug development paradigm. Here we 
leverage this strategy to develop a new class of small molecule antivirals that 
induce proteasomal degradation of viral proteins. Telaprevir, a 
reversible-covalent inhibitor that binds to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease 
active site is conjugated to ligands that recruit the CRL4CRBN ligase complex, 
yielding compounds that can both inhibit and induce the degradation of the HCV 
NS3/4A protease. An optimized degrader, DGY-08-097, potently inhibits HCV in a 
cellular infection model, and we demonstrate that protein degradation 
contributes to its antiviral activity. Finally, we show that this new class of 
antiviral agents can overcome viral variants that confer resistance to 
traditional enzymatic inhibitors such as telaprevir. Overall, our work provides 
proof-of-concept that targeted protein degradation may provide a new paradigm 
for the development of antivirals with superior resistance profiles.
