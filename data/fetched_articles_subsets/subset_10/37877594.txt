This study explored the acceptability of a novel pharmacist-led pharmacogenetics 
(PGx) screening program among patients with cancer and healthcare professionals 
(HCPs) taking part in a multicenter clinical trial of PGx testing (PACIFIC-PGx 
ANZCTR:12621000251820). Medical oncologists, oncology pharmacists, and patients 
with cancer from across four sites (metropolitan/regional), took part in an 
observational, cross-sectional survey. Participants were recruited from the 
multicenter trial. Two study-specific surveys were developed to inform 
implementation strategies for scaled and sustainable translation into routine 
clinical care: one consisting of 21 questions targeting HCPs and one consisting 
of 17 questions targeting patients. Responses were collected from 24 HCPs and 
288 patients. The 5-to-7-day PGx results turnaround time was acceptable to HCP 
(100%) and patients (69%). Most HCPs (92%) indicated that it was appropriate for 
the PGx clinical pharmacist to provide results to patients. Patients reported 
equal preference for receiving PGx results from a doctor/pharmacist. Patients 
and HCPs highly rated the pharmacist-led PGx service. HCPs were overall 
accepting of the program, with the majority (96%) willing to offer PGx testing 
to their patients beyond the trial. HCPs identified that lack of financial 
reimbursements (62%) and lack of infrastructure (38%) were the main reasons 
likely to prevent/slow the implementation of PGx screening program into routine 
clinical care. Survey data have shown overall acceptability from patients and 
HCPs participating in the PGx Program. Barriers to implementation of PGx testing 
in routine care have been identified, providing opportunity to develop targeted 
implementation strategies for scaled translation into routine practice.
