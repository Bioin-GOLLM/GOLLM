Skin disorders showing abnormal pigmentation are often difficult to manage 
because of their uncertain etiology or pathogenesis. Abnormal pigmentation is a 
common symptom accompanying aging skin. The association between skin aging and 
skin pigmentation abnormalities can be attributed to certain inherited disorders 
characterized by premature aging and abnormal pigmentation in the skin and some 
therapeutic modalities effective for both. Several molecular mechanisms, 
including oxidative stress, mitochondrial DNA mutations, DNA damage, telomere 
shortening, hormonal changes, and autophagy impairment, have been identified as 
involved in skin aging. Although each of these skin aging-related mechanisms are 
interconnected, this review examined the role of each mechanism in skin 
hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation to propose the possible association 
between skin aging and pigmentation abnormalities.
