In healthy muscle, the rapid release of calcium ions (Ca2+) with 
excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, results in elevations in Ca2+ 
concentrations which can exceed 10-fold that of resting values. The sizable 
transient changes in Ca2+ concentrations are necessary for the activation of 
signaling pathways, which rely on Ca2+ as a second messenger, including those 
involved with force generation, fiber type distribution and hypertrophy. 
However, prolonged elevations in intracellular Ca2+ can result in the unwanted 
activation of Ca2+ signaling pathways that cause muscle damage, dysfunction, and 
disease. Muscle employs several calcium handling and calcium transport proteins 
that function to rapidly return Ca2+ concentrations back to resting levels 
following contraction. This review will detail our current understanding of 
calcium handling during the decay phase of intracellular calcium transients in 
healthy skeletal and cardiac muscle. We will also discuss how impairments in 
Ca2+ transport can occur and how mishandling of Ca2+ can lead to the 
pathogenesis and/or progression of skeletal muscle myopathies and 
cardiomyopathies.
