BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a base chemical used extensively in many 
consumer products. BPA and its analogues are present in environmental and human 
samples. Many endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including BPA, have been shown to 
activate the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that functions as a 
master regulator of xenobiotic metabolism. However, the detailed mechanism by 
which these chemicals activate PXR remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the mechanism by which BPA interacts with and 
activates PXR and examined selected BPA analogues to determine whether they bind 
to and activate PXR.
METHODS: Cell-based reporter assays, in silico ligand-PXR docking studies, and 
site-directed mutagenesis were combined to study the interaction between BPA and 
PXR. We also investigated the influence of BPA and its analogues on the 
regulation of PXR target genes in human LS180 cells.
RESULTS: We found that BPA and several of its analogues are potent agonists for 
human PXR (hPXR) but do not affect mouse PXR activity. We identified key 
residues within hPXR's ligand-binding pocket that constitute points of 
interaction with BPA. We also deduced the structural requirements of BPA 
analogues that activate hPXR. BPA and its analogues can also induce PXR target 
gene expression in human LS180 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study advances our understanding of the mechanism by 
which BPA interacts with and activates human PXR. Activation of PXR by BPA may 
explain some of the adverse effects of BPA in humans.
