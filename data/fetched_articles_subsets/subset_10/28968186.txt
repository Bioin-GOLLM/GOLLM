Circadian timekeeping systems drive oscillatory gene expression to regulate 
essential cellular and physiological processes. When the systems are perturbed, 
pathological consequences ensue and disease risks rise. A growing number of 
small-molecule modulators have been reported to target circadian systems. Such 
small molecules, identified via high-throughput screening or derivatized from 
known scaffolds, have shown promise as drug candidates to improve biological 
timing and physiological outputs in disease models. In this review, we first 
briefly describe the circadian system, including the core oscillator and the 
cellular networks. Research progress on clock-modulating small molecules is 
presented, focusing on development strategies and biological efficacies. We 
highlight the therapeutic potential of small molecules in clock-related 
pathologies, including jet lag and shiftwork; various chronic diseases, 
particularly metabolic disease; and aging. Emerging opportunities to identify 
and exploit clock modulators as novel therapeutic agents are discussed.
