Cisplatin-based treatment is the standard of care therapy for urothelial 
carcinomas. However, complex cisplatin resistance mechanisms limit the success 
of this approach. Both apoptosis and autophagy have been shown to contribute to 
this resistance. Prodigiosin, a secondary metabolite from various bacteria, 
exerts different biological activities including the modulation of these two 
cellular stress response pathways. We analyzed the effect of prodigiosin on 
protein levels of different autophagy- and apoptosis-related proteins in 
cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant urothelial carcinoma cells (UCCs). 
Furthermore, we investigated the effect on cell viability of prodigiosin alone 
or in combination with cisplatin. We made use of four different pairs of 
cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant UCCs. We found that prodigiosin blocked 
autophagy in UCCs and re-sensitized cisplatin-resistant cells to apoptotic cell 
death. Furthermore, we found that prodigiosin is a potent anticancer agent with 
nanomolar IC50 values in all tested UCCs. In combination studies, we observed 
that prodigiosin sensitized both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant urothelial 
carcinoma cell lines to cisplatin treatment with synergistic effects in most 
tested cell lines. These effects of prodigiosin are at least partially mediated 
by altering lysosomal function, since we detected reduced activities of 
cathepsin B and L. We propose that prodigiosin is a promising candidate for the 
therapy of cisplatin-resistant urothelial carcinomas, either as a single agent 
or in combinatory therapeutic approaches.
