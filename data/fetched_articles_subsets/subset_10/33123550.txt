Recent evidence shows that COVID-19 patients with existing metabolic disorders, 
such as diabetes and metabolic syndrome, are exposed to a high risk of morbidity 
and mortality. At the same time, in order to manage the pandemic, the health 
authorities around the world are advising people to stay at home. This results 
in decreased physical activity and an increased consumption of an unhealthy 
diet, which often leads to an increase in body weight, risk for diabetes, 
insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, and thus, paradoxically, to a high 
risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 complications. Here we summarize 
the evidence demonstrating that the promotion of a healthy life style, including 
physical activity and a dietary intake of natural polyphenols present in coffee 
and tea, has the potential to improve the prevention and management of insulin 
resistance and diabetes in the time of COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, it would 
be pertinent to evaluate further the potential positive effects of coffee 
beverages, rich in natural polyphenols, as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19, 
which appear not to be studied sufficiently.
