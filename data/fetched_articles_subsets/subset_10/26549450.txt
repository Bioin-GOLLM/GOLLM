There is an urgent need to identify new treatments for fungal infections. By 
combining sub-lethal concentrations of the known antifungals fluconazole, 
caspofungin, amphotericin B, terbinafine, benomyl, and cyprodinil with ∼3,600 
compounds in diverse fungal species, we generated a deep reservoir of 
chemical-chemical interactions termed the Antifungal Combinations Matrix (ACM). 
Follow-up susceptibility testing against a fluconazole-resistant isolate of C. 
albicans unveiled ACM combinations capable of potentiating fluconazole in this 
clinical strain. We used chemical genetics to elucidate the mode of action of 
the antimycobacterial drug clofazimine, a compound with unreported antifungal 
activity that synergized with several antifungals. Clofazimine induces a cell 
membrane stress for which the Pkc1 signaling pathway is required for tolerance. 
Additional tests against additional fungal pathogens, including Aspergillus 
fumigatus, highlighted that clofazimine exhibits efficacy as a combination agent 
against multiple fungi. Thus, the ACM is a rich reservoir of chemical 
combinations with therapeutic potential against diverse fungal pathogens.
