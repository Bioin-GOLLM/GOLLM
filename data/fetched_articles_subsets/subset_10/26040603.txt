The prokaryotic type II CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short 
palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated 9) system is rapidly revolutionizing the 
field of genetic engineering, allowing researchers to alter the genomes of a 
large range of organisms with relative ease. Experimental approaches based on 
this versatile technology have the potential to transform the field of cancer 
genetics. Here, we review current approaches for functional studies of cancer 
genes that are based on CRISPR-Cas, with emphasis on their applicability for the 
development of next-generation models of human cancer.
