The three-term conjugate gradient (CG) algorithms are among the efficient 
variants of CG algorithms for solving optimization models. This is due to their 
simplicity and low memory requirements. On the other hand, the regression model 
is one of the statistical relationship models whose solution is obtained using 
one of the least square methods including the CG-like method. In this paper, we 
present a modification of a three-term conjugate gradient method for 
unconstrained optimization models and further establish the global convergence 
under inexact line search. The proposed method was extended to formulate a 
regression model for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The study considers the 
globally infected cases from January to October 2020 in parameterizing the 
model. Preliminary results have shown that the proposed method is promising and 
produces efficient regression model for COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the method was 
extended to solve a motion control problem involving a two-joint planar robot.
