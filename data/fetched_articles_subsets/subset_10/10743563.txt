The cadmium-resistant gene, CAD2, which is a mutated putative copper-transporter 
gene (PCA1), controls the intracellular cadmium-level in the yeast S. 
cerevisiae.

Yeast cells carrying the CAD2 gene exhibit a resistance to cadmium. We cloned 
this gene and demonstrated that it was a mutated form derived from the gene of a 
putative copper-transporting ATPase (PCA1). By site-directed mutagenesis, it 
appeared that the mutation conferring cadmium resistance was a 
R970G-substitution in the C-terminal region of Pca1 protein. The intracellular 
cadmium level of cells carrying CAD2 was lower than that of cells carrying 
either PAC1 or delta cad2. Furthermore, cells with overexpression of CAD2 showed 
a much lower intracellular cadmium level than that of cells with a single-copy 
CAD2. From these results, we conclude that the Cad2 protein controls the 
intracellular cadmium level through an enhanced cadmium efflux system.
