In this report we describe the first human case of hypertryptophanemia confirmed 
to be due to tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase deficiency. The underlying etiology was 
established by sequencing the TDO2 gene, in which there was compound 
heterozygosity for two rare variants: c.324G>C, p.Met108Ile and c.491dup, 
p.Ile165Aspfs*12. The pathogenicity of these variants was confirmed by 
molecular-level studies, which showed that c.491dup does not produce soluble 
protein and c.324G>C results in a catalytically less efficient Met108Ile enzyme 
that is prone to proteolytic degradation. The biochemical phenotype of 
hypertryptophanemia and hyperserotoninemia does not appear to have significant 
clinical consequences.
