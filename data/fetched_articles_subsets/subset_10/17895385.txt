Von Willebrand factor (VWF) dimerizes through C-terminal CK domains, and VWF 
dimers assemble into multimers in the Golgi by forming intersubunit disulfide 
bonds between D3 domains. This unusual oxidoreductase reaction requires the VWF 
propeptide (domains D1D2), which acts as an endogenous pH-dependent chaperone. 
The cysteines involved in multimer assembly were characterized by using a VWF 
construct that encodes the N-terminal D1D2D'D3 domains. Modification with 
thiol-specific reagents demonstrated that secreted D'D3 monomer contained 
reduced Cys, whereas D'D3 dimer and propeptide did not. Reduced Cys in the D'D3 
monomer were alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide and analyzed by mass spectrometry. 
All 52 Cys within the D'D3 region were observed, and only Cys(1099) and 
Cys(1142) were modified by N-ethylmaleimide. When introduced into the D1D2D'D3 
construct, the mutation C1099A or C1142A markedly impaired the formation of D'D3 
dimers, and the double mutation prevented dimerization. In full-length VWF, the 
mutations C1099A and C1099A/C1142A prevented multimer assembly; the mutation 
C1142A allowed the formation of almost exclusively dimers, with few tetramers 
and no multimers larger than hexamers. Therefore, Cys(1099) and Cys(1142) are 
essential for the oxidoreductase mechanism of VWF multimerization. Cys(1142) is 
reported to form a Cys(1142)-Cys(1142) intersubunit bond, suggesting that 
Cys(1099) also participates in a Cys(1099)-Cys(1099) disulfide bond between D3 
domains. This arrangement of intersubunit disulfide bonds implies that the 
dimeric N-terminal D'D3 domains of VWF subunits align in a parallel orientation 
within VWF multimers.
