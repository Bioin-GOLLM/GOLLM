In recent years, Campylobacter has become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, 
especially those first-choice drugs used to treat campylobacteriosis. Studies in 
South America have reported cases of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter in 
several countries, mainly in Brazil. To understand the current frequency of 
antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter in humans, farm animals, and food of animal 
origin in South America, we systematically searched for different studies that 
have reported Campylobacter resistance. The most commonly reported species were 
C. jejuni and C. coli. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was found to be ubiquitous in 
the isolates. Nalidixic acid and tetracycline showed a significantly expressed 
resistance. Erythromycin, the antibiotic of first choice for the treatment of 
campylobacteriosis, showed a low rate of resistance in isolates but was detected 
in almost all countries. The main sources of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter 
isolates were food of animal origin and farm animals. The results demonstrate 
that resistant Campylobacter isolates are disseminated from multiple sources 
linked to animal production in South America. The level of resistance that was 
identified may compromise the treatment of campylobacteriosis in human and 
animal populations. In this way, we are here showing all South American 
communities the need for the constant surveillance of Campylobacter resistance 
and the need for the strategic use of antibiotics in animal production. These 
actions are likely to decrease future difficulties in the treatment of human 
campylobacteriosis.
