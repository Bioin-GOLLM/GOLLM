DNA methylation in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.

Pang JM, Dobrovic A, Fox SB.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor lesion of invasive 
carcinoma of the breast. Current prognostic markers based on histopathological 
examination are unable to accurately predict which DCIS cases will progress to 
invasive carcinoma or recur after surgical excision. Epigenetic changes have 
been shown to be a significant driver of tumorigenesis, and DNA methylation of 
specific gene promoters provides predictive and prognostic markers in many types 
of cancer, including invasive breast cancer. In general, the spectrum of genes 
that are methylated in DCIS strongly resembles that seen in invasive ductal 
carcinoma. The identification of specific prognostic markers in DCIS remains 
elusive and awaits additional work investigating a large panel of methylatable 
genes by using sensitive and reproducible technologies. This review critically 
appraises the role of methylation in DCIS and its use as a biomarker.
