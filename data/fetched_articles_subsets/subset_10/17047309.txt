Aggregated misfolded proteins are hallmarks of most neurodegenerative diseases. 
In a chronic disease state, including pathologic situations of oxidative stress, 
these proteins are sequestered into inclusions. Accumulation of aggregated 
proteins can be prevented by chaperones, or by targeting their degradation to 
the UPS. If the accumulation of these proteins exceeds their degradation, they 
may impair the function of the proteasome. Alternatively, the function of the 
proteasome may be preserved by directing aggregated proteins to the 
autophagy-lysosome pathway for degradation. Sequestosome 1/p62 has recently been 
shown to interact with polyubiquitinated proteins through its UBA domain and may 
direct proteins to either the UPS or autophagosome. P62 is present in neuronal 
inclusions of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative 
diseases. Herein, we review p62's role in signaling, aggregation, and inclusion 
formation, and specifically as a possible contributor to Alzheimer's disease. 
The use of p62 as a potential target for the development of therapeutics and as 
a disease biomarker is also discussed.
