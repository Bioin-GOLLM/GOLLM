OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and secular trends in benzodiazepine (BZD) 
prescribing in the Irish paediatric population. In addition, we examine 
coprescribing of antiepileptic, antipsychotic, antidepressant and 
psychostimulants in children receiving BZD drugs and compare BZD prescribing in 
Ireland to that in other European countries.
SETTING: Data were obtained from the Irish General Medical Services (GMS) scheme 
pharmacy claims database from the Health Service Executive (HSE)--Primary Care 
Reimbursement Services (PCRS).
PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 0-15 years, on the HSE-PCRS database between January 
2002 and December 2011, were included.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prescribing rates were reported over 
time (2002-2011) and duration (â‰¤ or >90 days). Age (0-4, 5-11, 12-15) and gender 
trends were established. Rates of concomitant prescriptions for antiepileptic, 
antipsychotics, antidepressants and psychostimulants were reported. European 
prescribing data were retrieved from the literature.
RESULTS: Rates decreased from 2002 (8.56/1000 GMS population: 95% CI 8.20 to 
8.92) to 2011 (5.33/1000 GMS population: 95% CI 5.10 to 5.55). Of those children 
currently receiving a BZD prescription, 6% were prescribed BZD for >90 days. 
Rates were higher for boys in the 0-4 and 5-11 age ranges, whereas for girls 
they were higher in the 12-15 age groups. A substantial proportion of children 
receiving BZD drugs are also prescribed antiepileptic (27%), antidepressant 
(11%), antipsychotic (5%) and psychostimulant (2%) medicines. Prescribing rates 
follow a similar pattern to that in other European countries.
CONCLUSIONS: While BZD prescribing trends have decreased in recent years, this 
study shows that a significant proportion of the GMS children population are 
being prescribed BZD in the long term. This study highlights the need for 
guidelines for BZD prescribing in children in terms of clinical indication and 
responsibility, coprescribing, dosage and duration of treatment.
