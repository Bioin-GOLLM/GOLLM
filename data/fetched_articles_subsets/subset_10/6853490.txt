Human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase.

Wilson JM, Kobayashi R, Fox IH, Kelley WN.

A mutant form of human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 
(HPRTToronto) was isolated from erythrocytes of a male patient with gout due to 
a partial deficiency of enzyme activity. The tryptic peptides of HPRTToronto 
were mapped by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography in an attempt 
to define the precise abnormality in its primary structure. Sequence analysis of 
the single aberrant peptide in HPRTToronto revealed an arginine to glycine amino 
acid substitution at position 50. A single nucleotide change in the codon for 
arginine 50 (CGA leads to GGA) could explain this substitution.
