How adult neurons coordinate lipid metabolism to regenerate axons remains 
elusive. We found that depleting neuronal lipin1, a key enzyme controlling the 
balanced synthesis of glycerolipids through the glycerol phosphate pathway, 
enhanced axon regeneration after optic nerve injury. Axotomy elevated lipin1 in 
retinal ganglion cells, which contributed to regeneration failure in the CNS by 
favorably producing triglyceride (TG) storage lipids rather than phospholipid 
(PL) membrane lipids in neurons. Regrowth induced by lipin1 depletion required 
TG hydrolysis and PL synthesis. Decreasing TG synthesis by deleting neuronal 
diglyceride acyltransferases (DGATs) and enhancing PL synthesis through the 
Kennedy pathway promoted axon regeneration. In addition, peripheral neurons 
adopted this mechanism for their spontaneous axon regeneration. Our study 
reveals a critical role of lipin1 and DGATs as intrinsic regulators of 
glycerolipid metabolism in neurons and indicates that directing neuronal lipid 
synthesis away from TG synthesis and toward PL synthesis may promote axon 
regeneration.
