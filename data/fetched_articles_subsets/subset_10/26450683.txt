The PERK-eIF2α branch of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) mediates the 
transient shutdown of translation in response to rising levels of misfolded 
proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. PERK and eIF2α activation are 
increasingly recognised in postmortem analyses of patients with 
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, the tauopathies and 
prion disorders. These are all characterised by the accumulation of misfolded 
disease-specific proteins in the brain in association with specific patterns of 
neuronal loss, but the role of UPR activation in their pathogenesis is unclear. 
In prion-diseased mice, overactivation of PERK-P/eIF2α-P signalling results in 
the sustained reduction in global protein synthesis, leading to synaptic 
failure, neuronal loss and clinical disease. Critically, restoring vital 
neuronal protein synthesis rates by inhibiting the PERK-eIF2α pathway, both 
genetically and pharmacologically, prevents prion neurodegeneration downstream 
of misfolded prion protein accumulation. Here we show that PERK-eIF2α-mediated 
translational failure is a key process leading to neuronal loss in a mouse model 
of frontotemporal dementia, where the misfolded protein is a form of mutant tau. 
rTg4510 mice, which overexpress the P301L tau mutation, show dysregulated PERK 
signalling and sustained repression of protein synthesis by 6 months of age, 
associated with onset of neurodegeneration. Treatment with the PERK inhibitor, 
GSK2606414, from this time point in mutant tau-expressing mice restores protein 
synthesis rates, protecting against further neuronal loss, reducing brain 
atrophy and abrogating the appearance of clinical signs. Further, we show that 
PERK-eIF2α activation also contributes to the pathological phosphorylation of 
tau in rTg4510 mice, and that levels of phospho-tau are lowered by PERK 
inhibitor treatment, providing a second mechanism of protection. The data 
support UPR-mediated translational failure as a generic pathogenic mechanism in 
protein-misfolding disorders, including tauopathies, that can be successfully 
targeted for prevention of neurodegeneration.
