BACKGROUND: Exacerbations are responsible for a substantial burden of morbidity 
and health care use in children with asthma. Most asthma exacerbations are 
triggered by viral infections; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been 
systematically investigated.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to elucidate the molecular networks 
that underpin virus-induced exacerbations in asthmatic children in vivo.
METHODS: We followed exacerbation-prone asthmatic children prospectively and 
profiled global patterns of gene expression in nasal lavage samples obtained 
during an acute, moderate, picornavirus-induced exacerbation and 7 to 14 days 
later. Coexpression network analysis and prior knowledge was used to reconstruct 
the underlying gene networks.
RESULTS: The data showed that an intricate modular program consisting of more 
than 1000 genes was upregulated during acute exacerbations in comparison with 7 
to 14 days later. The modules were enriched for coherent cellular processes, 
including interferon-induced antiviral responses, innate pathogen sensing, 
response to wounding, small nucleolar RNAs, and the ubiquitin-proteosome and 
lysosome degradation pathways. Reconstruction of the wiring diagram of the 
modules revealed the presence of hyperconnected hub nodes, most notably 
interferon regulatory factor 7, which was identified as a major hub linking 
interferon-mediated antiviral responses.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an integrated view of the inflammatory networks 
that are upregulated during virus-induced asthma exacerbations in vivo. A series 
of innate signaling hubs were identified that could be novel therapeutic targets 
for asthma attacks.
