The mammalian N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex is though to consist 
of an NR1 subunit in combination with one or more of the four NR2 subunits (A, 
B, C, and D). When corresponding cDNAs are expressed in Xenopus oocytes, ion 
channels with the characteristic profile of NMDA receptors are formed. The 
receptor is unique in requiring two coagonists, glutamate and glycine, for 
activation of the channel. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to study amino 
acids in the human NR1 subunit that contribute to the glycine binding site of 
the NMDA receptor without affecting the agonist site for glutamate. Mutations to 
D481 and K483 produced receptors with up to 160-fold lower affinities for 
glycine, as well as other agonists and partial agonists, without affecting 
maximum current size or the degree of agonist efficacy. The D481A mutation also 
led to 40-50-fold lower affinities for two structurally diverse glycine site 
antagonists. From these data we propose that the carboxyl group of this 
aspartate interacts with the amino moiety of glycine and the equivalent group 
contained in other agonists and antagonists.
