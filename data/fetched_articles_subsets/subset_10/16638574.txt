LEOPARD (LS) and Noonan (NS) are overlapping syndromes associated with distinct 
mutations of SHP-2. Whereas NS mutations enhance SHP-2 catalytic activity, we 
show that the activity of three representative LS mutants is undetectable when 
assayed using a standard protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) substrate. A 
different assay using a specific SHP-2 substrate confirms their decreased PTP 
activity, but also reveals a significant activity of the T468M mutant. In 
transfected cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor, the least active LS 
mutants promote Gab1/PI3K binding, validating our in vitro data. LS mutants thus 
display a reduced PTP activity both in vitro and in transfected cells.
