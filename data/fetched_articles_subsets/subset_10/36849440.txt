Voltage-gated potassium channels are involved in many physiological processes 
such as nerve impulse transmission, the heartbeat, and muscle contraction. 
However, for many of them the molecular determinants of the gating mechanism 
remain elusive. Here, using a combination of theoretical and experimental 
approaches, we address this problem focusing on the cardiac hERG potassium 
channel. Network analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories reveals the 
presence of a kinematic chain of residues that couples the voltage sensor domain 
to the pore domain and involves the S4/S1 and S1/S5 subunit interfaces. 
Mutagenesis experiments confirm the role of these residues and interfaces in the 
activation and inactivation mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate the presence of 
an electromechanical transduction path crucial for the non-domain-swapped hERG 
channel gating that resembles the noncanonical path identified in domain-swapped 
K+ channels.
