BACKGROUD: The role of maternal hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) in the 
development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is unclear.
METHODS: Studies were retrieved through literature searches in PubMed, EMBASE, 
Web of Science and the Cochrane Library up to May 5, 2016 without language 
restrictions. Cohort or case-control studies that reported the association of 
maternal hypertensive disorders and retinopathy of prematurity were eligible. 
Either a fixed- or a random-effects model was used to calculate the overall 
combined risk estimates.
RESULTS: Thirteen cohort studies involving a total of 45082 individuals were 
included in the review. The pooled odds ratios of maternal hypertensive 
disorders in pregnancy for any stage and severe stages of ROP was 1.12 (95%CI: 
0.90-1.40) and 0.80 (95%CI: 0.47-1.35), respectively. Sensitivity analyses 
confirmed that no single study qualitatively influenced the pooled OR. However, 
substantial heterogeneity and publication bias were observed in the 
meta-analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional larger, prospective and well-adjusted studies are needed 
to determine the association between HDP and ROP, especially regarding the 
effects of different types of maternal hypertensive disorders in pregnancy on 
retinopathy of prematurity.
