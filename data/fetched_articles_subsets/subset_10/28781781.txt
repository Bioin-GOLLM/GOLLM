Previous studies have indicated that, in lung cancers, the gene rearrangement of 
ALK is mutually exclusive with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) gene. However, the coexistence of EML4-ALK fusions and EGFR mutations 
(double positive) has been occasionally reported, with frequencies ranging from 
0-8%. Currently, no consensus standard therapy exists for tumors with double 
positive mutations. In the present case report, the case is described of a 
53-year-old woman with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, harboring a concomitant 
EGFR mutation and ALK gene rearrangement, who was refractory to gefitinib 
administration but demonstrated a good response to crizotinib and pemetrexed 
chemotherapy. A review of the literature revealed a total of 65 cases, including 
our case, harboring double positive mutations, and of these cases, 39 (60.0%) 
patients had received an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EHGR-TKI), and 15 (23%) 
patients had received crizotinib treatment, the majority of whom had crizotinib 
selected for them as a second-line or third-line therapy. The disease control 
rate (DCR) of EGFR-TKI was 72.2%, with the progression-free survival (PFS) being 
11.9 months, whereas the DCR of crizotinib was 93.3%, with the PFS being 10 
months.
