Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder (NOMID) is a rare congenital 
disorder characterized by a neonatal-onset urticarial rash, arthropathy, 
recurrent fevers, and central nervous system disease. We report 3 cases in which 
patients presented with neonatal-onset urticarial eruption and other organ 
involvement of varying severity. Genetic testing of 2 of these patients revealed 
previously unreported genetic mutations in exon 3 of the CIAS1 gene, a recently 
discovered member of the pyrin gene family. The third patient did not 
demonstrate a CIAS1 mutation. These cases illustrate the genetic basis of NOMID, 
an autoinflammatory disorder, and highlight the emerging role of the pyrin gene 
family in the regulation of nuclear factor kappaB signaling and other pathways 
involved in inflammation and apoptosis.
