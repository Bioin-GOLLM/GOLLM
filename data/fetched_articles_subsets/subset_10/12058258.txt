Ample evidence supports a role for tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in 
the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. TNFalpha 
expression was found to be influenced by a -308G/A polymorphism in the promoter 
of the gene encoding TNFalpha (TNF). We investigated the contribution of this 
polymorphism to diabetes and cardiovascular mortality in a population-based 
cohort of 664 subjects aged 85 years and over (Leiden 85-plus Study). The 
-308G/A TNF promoter polymorphism was associated with the prevalence of diabetes 
in old age (P = 0.006). The risk of diabetes among subjects homozygous for the 
A-allele was estimated to be 4.6-fold (95% CI, 1.6-13.3) higher than among 
subjects homozygous for the common G-allele. The promoter polymorphism did not, 
however, predict mortality from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer or 
infectious diseases during a 10-year follow-up period. In addition to the 
promoter polymorphism, TNFa and TNFc microsatellite genotypes were determined 
but these polymorphisms were not associated with morbidity or mortality. In 
conclusion, the -308G/A polymorphism in the TNF promoter is strongly associated 
with the risk of diabetes but not cardiovascular mortality in old age.
