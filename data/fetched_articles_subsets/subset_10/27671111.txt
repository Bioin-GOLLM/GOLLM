Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α isoforms regulate key macrophage (MΦ) functions 
during ischemic inflammation. HIF-2α drives proinflammatory cytokine production; 
however, the requirements for HIF-2α during other key MΦ functions, including 
phagocytosis, are unknown. In contrast to HIF-1α, HIF-2α was not required for 
hypoxic phagocytic uptake. Surprisingly, basal HIF-2α levels under nonhypoxic 
conditions were necessary and sufficient to suppress phagocytosis. Screening 
approaches revealed selective induction of the scavenger receptor MARCO, which 
was required for enhanced engulfment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified 
the antioxidant NRF2 as being directly responsible for inducing Marco 
Concordantly, Hif-2α-/- MΦs exhibited reduced antioxidant gene expression, and 
inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species suppressed Marco expression 
and phagocytic uptake. Ex vivo findings were recapitulated in vivo; the enhanced 
engulfment phenotype resulted in increased bacterial clearance and cytokine 
suppression. Importantly, natural induction of Hif-2α by IL-4 also suppressed 
MARCO-dependent phagocytosis. Thus, unlike most characterized prophagocytic 
regulators, HIF-2α can act as a phagocytic repressor. Interestingly, this occurs 
in resting MΦs through tempering of steady-state mitochondrial reactive oxygen 
species. In turn, HIF-2α promotes MΦ quiescence by blocking a MARCO 
bacterial-response pathway. IL-4 also drives HIF-2α suppression of MARCO, 
leading to compromised bacterial immunosurveillance in vivo.
