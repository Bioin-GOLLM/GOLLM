RATIONALE: Allergic diseases are influenced by both genes and environment. A 
70-kb haplotype block in the G protein-coupled receptor for asthma 
susceptibility gene (GPR154; alias GPRA) on chromosome 7p was recently 
identified to influence susceptibility to asthma and elevated total serum IgE 
levels in adults.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of GPR154 on childhood allergic disease, 
including allergic sensitization, asthma, and rhinoconjunctivitis, in study 
populations with diverse environmental backgrounds.
METHODS: We studied farm children, Steiner school children, and two reference 
groups from five Western European countries in the cross-sectional PARSIFAL 
(Prevention of Allergy Risk factors for Sensitization In children related to 
Farming and Anthroposophic Lifestyle) study and a sample of children from the 
Swedish birth cohort study BAMSE. DNA samples from 3,113 PARSIFAL and 800 BAMSE 
children were genotyped for 7 GPR154 polymorphisms and haplotypes were inferred. 
The proportions of alleles and haplotypes (H1-H7) were compared in affected 
children with their healthy counterparts.
RESULTS: Data indicate a global association of the haplotype block to 
sensitization (allergen-specific serum IgE > or = 0.35 kU/L, p = 0.022), with 
significant haplotype-specific associations for H1, H5, and H6. Haplotypes H1 
and H5 were also significantly associated with childhood allergic asthma (p = 
0.045 and p = 0.023, respectively), and H5 to asthma regardless of 
sensitization. A broader involvement of GPR154 in allergic diseases was further 
supported in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (H3: p = 0.046). The associated 
haplotypes could be allocated into risk (H5/H6) and nonrisk (H1/H3) groups, a 
pattern supported by allelic association of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) rs324384 and rs324396.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that polymorphisms and haplotypes in the 
haplotype block of GPR154 are associated with asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and 
sensitization in European children.
