AIM: To study polymorphism of genes involved in mechanisms regulating metabolism 
of bone tissue: alkaline (ALPL) and acid (ACP1) phosphatases, vitamin D-binding 
protein (GC); to ascertain associations of their genotypes and alleles with 
osteoporosis (OP) and mineral density of spinal and femoral bone tissue (BTMD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Relevant genetic examination was made in 70 females with 
OP diagnosed by the WHO criteria (1994) aged 60-79 years (mean age 71.0 +/- 6.2 
years) and 51 OP-free females in the same age interval (mean age 69.0 +/- 5.6 
years). Polymorphic sites of the genes were examined by polymerase chain 
reaction. Trinucleotide repeat, ARG105GLN polymorphism of restrictive fragment 
length (PRFL), [GC, TRH420LYS] PRFL were studied for ALPL gene, ACP1 gene and GC 
gene, respectively.
RESULTS: Association was found between frequencies of genotypes SS, 2F and FS, F 
allele of GC gene with OP as well as between PRFL of the spine, femur and some 
GC genotypes in OP women. Genes ALPL and ACP1 were not associated with OP.
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that genotypes SS, 2F and FS have marked functional 
differences in fixation and transport of vitamin D active metabolites involved 
in metabolism of bone tissue in OP.
