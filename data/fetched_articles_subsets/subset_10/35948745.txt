Atopic dermatitis is a common skin disease characterized by loss of skin 
integrity. Risk and severity have been associated with genetic variation 
especially with respect to the filaggrin gene, suggesting the importance of skin 
barrier function in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. The keratin protein plays a 
role in epithelial health but its relationship with disease severity would 
benefit from further exploration. In this study, we evaluate the association 
between common keratin 6 variants and severity of atopic dermatitis over time 
using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model to account for repeated 
measures. We identify groups of variants within which individual variants have 
similar effects on skin repair. Further assessment of the biological mechanisms 
by which these contribute to repair of epidermis may inform treatment of atopic 
dermatitis.
