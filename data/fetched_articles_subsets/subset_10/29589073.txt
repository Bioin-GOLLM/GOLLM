AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Excessive weight is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, but its 
role in the promotion of autoimmune diabetes is not clear. We investigated the 
risk of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) in relation to 
overweight/obesity in two large population-based studies.
METHODS: Analyses were based on incident cases of LADA (n = 425) and type 2 
diabetes (n = 1420), and 1704 randomly selected control participants from a 
Swedish case-control study and prospective data from the Norwegian HUNT Study 
including 147 people with LADA and 1,012,957 person-years of follow-up 
(1984-2008). We present adjusted ORs and HRs with 95% CI.
RESULTS: In the Swedish data, obesity was associated with an increased risk of 
LADA (OR 2.93, 95% CI 2.17, 3.97), which was even stronger for type 2 diabetes 
(OR 18.88, 95% CI 14.29, 24.94). The association was stronger in LADA with low 
GAD antibody (GADA; <median) (OR 4.25; 95% CI 2.76, 6.52) but present also in 
LADA with high GADA (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.42, 3.24). In the Swedish data, obese vs 
normal weight LADA patients had lower GADA levels, better beta cell function, 
and were more likely to have low-risk HLA-genotypes. The combination of 
overweight and family history of diabetes (FHD) conferred an OR of 4.57 (95% CI 
3.27, 6.39) for LADA and 24.51 (95% CI 17.82, 33.71) for type 2 diabetes. 
Prospective data from HUNT indicated even stronger associations; HR for LADA was 
6.07 (95% CI 3.76, 9.78) for obesity and 7.45 (95% CI 4.02, 13.82) for 
overweight and FHD.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Overweight/obesity is associated with increased risk 
of LADA, particularly when in combination with FHD. These findings support the 
hypothesis that, even in the presence of autoimmunity, factors linked to insulin 
resistance, such as excessive weight, could promote onset of diabetes.
