Genetic variation in genes regulating metabolism may be advantageous in some 
settings but not others. The non-failing adult heart relies heavily on fatty 
acids as a fuel substrate and source of ATP. In contrast, the failing heart 
favors glucose as a fuel source. A bootstrap analysis for genes with deviant 
allele frequencies in cardiomyopathy cases versus controls identified the MTCH2 
gene as having unusual variation. MTCH2 encodes an outer mitochondrial membrane 
protein, and prior genome-wide studies associated MTCH2 variants with body mass 
index, consistent with its role in metabolism. We identified the referent allele 
of rs1064608 (p.Pro290) as being overrepresented in cardiomyopathy cases 
compared to controls, and linkage disequilibrium analysis associated this 
variant with the MTCH2 cis eQTL rs10838738 and lower MTCH2 expression. To 
evaluate MTCH2, we knocked down Mtch in Drosophila heart tubes which produced a 
dilated and poorly functioning heart tube, reduced adiposity and shortened life 
span. Cardiac Mtch mutants generated more lactate at baseline, and they 
displayed impaired oxygen consumption in the presence of glucose but not 
palmitate. Treatment of cardiac Mtch mutants with dichloroacetate, a pyruvate 
dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor, reduced lactate and rescued lifespan. Deletion 
of MTCH2 in human cells similarly impaired oxygen consumption in the presence of 
glucose but not fatty acids. These data support a model in which MTCH2 reduction 
may be favorable when fatty acids are the major fuel source, favoring lean body 
mass. However, in settings like heart failure, where the heart shifts toward 
using more glucose, reduction of MTCH2 is maladaptive.
