Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)-activated 
guanylate cyclases are single-chain transmembrane-spanning proteins, containing 
both ligand binding and catalytic activities. In both proteins, ligand binding 
to the extracellular receptor domain activates the cytosolic catalytic domain, 
generating the second messenger cyclic GMP. Studies with ANF receptor guanylate 
cyclase (ANF-RGC) have indicated that obligatory in this activation process is 
an ATP-dependent step. ATP directly binds to the cyclase and bridges the events 
of ligand binding and signal transduction. A defined ATP-regulated module (ARM) 
sequence (Gly503-Arg-Gly-Ser-Asn-Tyr-Gly509) in the cyclase is critical in the 
ATP-mediated event. Through genetic remodeling techniques, we have now 
identified the core ARM sequence that is essential in both ANF and CNP 
signaling. This sequence is Gly-Xa-Xa-Xa-Gly, represented by 
Gly505-Ser-Asn-Tyr-Gly509 in the case of ANF-RGC ARM and by 
Gly499-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Gly503 in the CNP receptor guanylate cyclase ARM.
