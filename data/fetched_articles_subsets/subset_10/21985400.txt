BACKGROUND: Ph- myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) represent a heterogeneous 
group of chronic diseases characterized by increased expansion of hematopoietic 
cells of the myeloid lineage. JAK2V617F, an activation mutation form of tyrosine 
kinase JAK2, is found in the majority of patients with MPNs. Studies have 
demonstrated that JAK2V617F can cause MPNs, and various methods have been 
developed to detect JAK2V617F for diagnostic purposes. However, a highly 
sensitive method is still needed for the earliest possible detection and for 
disease prevention and treatment.
METHODS: In the present study, we developed a method dubbed restriction fragment 
nested allele-specific PCR (RFN-AS-PCR). The method consists of three steps: 1) 
initial amplification of DNA samples with PCR primers surrounding the JAK2V617F 
mutation site, 2) digestion of the PCR products with restriction enzyme BsaXI 
which only cleaves the wild type allele, and 3) detection of JAK2V617F by 
allele-specific PCR with nested primers.
RESULTS: We tested the sensitivity of the method by using purified plasmid DNAs 
and blood cell DNAs containing known proportions of JAK2V617F. We were able to 
detect JAK2V617F with a sensitivity of 0.001%. We further analyzed blood cell 
DNA samples from 105 healthy donors with normal blood cell counts and found 
three JAK2V617F-positive cases, which would have remained undetected using a 
less sensitive method.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a highly sensitive method that will allow for 
detection of JAK2V617F at a very early stage. This method may have major 
implications in diagnosis and prevention of MPNs and related diseases.
