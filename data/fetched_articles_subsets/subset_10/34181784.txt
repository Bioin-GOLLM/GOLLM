The Escherichia coli dnaE gene encodes the α-catalytic subunit (pol IIIα) of DNA 
polymerase III, the cell's main replicase. Like all high-fidelity DNA 
polymerases, pol III possesses stringent base and sugar discrimination. The 
latter is mediated by a so-called "steric gate" residue in the active site of 
the polymerase that physically clashes with the 2'-OH of an incoming 
ribonucleotide. Our structural modeling data suggest that H760 is the steric 
gate residue in E.coli pol IIIα. To understand how H760 and the adjacent S759 
residue help maintain genome stability, we generated DNA fragments in which the 
codons for H760 or S759 were systematically changed to the other nineteen 
naturally occurring amino acids and attempted to clone them into a plasmid 
expressing pol III core (α-θ-ε subunits). Of the possible 38 mutants, only nine 
were successfully sub-cloned: three with substitutions at H760 and 6 with 
substitutions at S759. Three of the plasmid-encoded alleles, S759C, S759N, and 
S759T, exhibited mild to moderate mutator activity and were moved onto the 
chromosome for further characterization. These studies revealed altered 
phenotypes regarding deoxyribonucleotide base selectivity and ribonucleotide 
discrimination. We believe that these are the first dnaE mutants with such 
phenotypes to be reported in the literature.
