Mastocytosis is a rare infiltrative disorder characterized by mast cell 
proliferation within the skin and various extra-cutaneous organ systems. We 
report the case of a full-term neonate admitted to the neonatal intensive care 
unit for evaluation of diffuse skin lesions on her face, trunk and extremities. 
Initially, the lesions appeared to be consistent with a blueberry muffin rash. 
However, over a period of days the lesions became vesicular and changed in shape 
and number. The neonate underwent evaluation for infective etiologies, skin 
biopsy of the lesions, and flow cytometry analysis of the peripheral blood. The 
surgical pathology examination of the skin biopsy demonstrated mast cells 
consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis. A review of relevant 
literature is also provided.
