BACKGROUND: As a heterogeneous hereditary connective tissue disorder, 
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is clinically characterized by increased fracture 
susceptibility. Analysis of genetic pathogenic variants in patients with OI 
provides a basis for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.
METHODS: In this study, 14 diagnosed OI patients from sporadic Chinese families 
were enrolled to be screened for potential mutations from these patients by 
next-generation sequencing technology.
RESULTS: 34 different variants were identified. 18 variants were from 4 
OI-related genes including COL1A1, COL1A2, P3H1, and WNT1, and 10 variants are 
novel. Most OI patients (11 out of 14, 78%) harbor variants in type I collagen 
genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support previously established estimates of the 
distribution and prevalence of OI mutations and highlight both phenotype and 
genetic heterogeneity among and within families. We report several novel 
variants of OI, which expands the clinical spectrum of OI. In summary, our data 
provides disease-causing genes information for genetic counseling towards OI 
patients and families and also provides a reference for clinicians in the 
diagnosis of OI, also in prenatal diagnosis of this disease.
