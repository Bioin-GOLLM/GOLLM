BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (Pca) is one of the most frequently encountered 
multifactorial malignant diseases worldwide. The human oxoguanine glycosylase 1 
(hOGG1) C1245G polymorphism (rs1052133) has been found to be associated with 
Pca. However, the conclusions have been controversial.
METHODS: Based on the PubMed, Embase, HuGENet and Chinese National Knowledge 
Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, this meta-analysis was conducted with 4 models. 
Eleven qualified studies were included.
RESULTS: Although no positive relation was discovered in the pooled analysis, 
significant associations between rs1052133 and Pca were found in the Asian 
population (recessive: odds ratio [OR] = 1.580, 95% confidence interval [95% 
CI], 1.189-2.098; GG vs. GC: OR = 1.504, 95% CI, 1.114-2.030; GG vs. CC: OR = 
1.677, 95% CI, 1.201-2.342; allele analysis: OR = 1.249, 95% CI, 1.077-1.449), 
whites (dominant: OR = 2.138, 95% CI, 1.483-3.083; recessive: OR = 3.143, 95% 
CI, 1.171-8.437; GG vs. CC: OR = 3.992, 95% CI, 1.891-8.431; allele analysis: OR 
= 1.947, 95% CI, 1.467-2.586) and mixed populations (recessive: OR = 0.636, 95% 
CI, 0.484-0.834; GG vs. GC: OR = 0.654, 95% CI, 0.492-0.871; GG vs. CC: OR = 
0.624, 95% CI, 0.473-0.823; allele analysis: OR = 0.857, 95% CI, 0.771-0.954). 
After excluding studies deviating from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, a 
significant association was also found in the same ethnic groups. In addition, a 
new positive relation was identified in the "other country" subgroup (with 
China, South Korea and Australia included) (dominant: OR = 1.622, 95% CI, 
1.163-2.261; recessive: OR = 1.773, 95% CI, 1.308-2.404; GG vs. GC: OR = 1.614, 
95% CI, 1.169-2.230; GG vs. CC: OR = 2.108, 95% CI, 1.456-3.051; allele 
analysis: OR = 1.494, 95% CI, 1.235-1.808) and among the Chinese-Korean 
population.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we suggest that the hOGG1 C1245G polymorphism might 
be potentially associated with Pca risk in different ethnicities and countries, 
especially among Asians. Further studies are needed to confirm these relations.
