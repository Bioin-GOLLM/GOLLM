Ancient mechanisms for nucleotide base recognition in the RNA world are 
candidates for mimicking by early proteins like tRNA synthetases. In the core of 
the tRNA, conserved G22 interacts with two internal bases in a complex further 
stabilized by stacking interactions. This particular tRNA format for G 
recognition is shown here to be adapted by nine different and even nonhomologous 
anticodon binding domains (ABDs) of tRNA synthetases, in which amino acid side 
chains mimic all of the tRNA G22 base interactions. We offer the possibility 
that mimicking this RNA-based mechanism for guanine recognition is perhaps one 
of the selective pressures for choosing amino acids for the genetic code.
