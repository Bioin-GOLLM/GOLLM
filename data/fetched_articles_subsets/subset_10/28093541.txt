Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are recognized as fundamental contributors to the 
immune system function against infections. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 
represents a global health problem especially in Egypt having the highest HCV 
prevalence worldwide where HCV infection is a continuing epidemic. The aim of 
the present study was to investigate the possible association between genetic 
variation in TLR-3 and TLR-9 and HCV infection and hepatic fibrosis in chronic 
HCV-positive Egyptian patients. The present study included 100 na√Øve chronic 
HCV-positive patients and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Genotyping 
of TLR-3 (_7 C/A [rs3775296]), TLR-3 (c.1377C/T [rs3775290]) and TLR-9 (1237T/C 
[rs5743836]) were done by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length 
polymorphism technique. Frequency of polymorphic genotypes in TLR-3 (_7 C/A), 
TLR-3 (c.1377C/T) and TLR-9 (1237T/C) were not significantly different between 
studied HCV-positive patients and controls with P values 0.121, 0.112, and 
0.683, respectively. TLR-3 c.1377 T-allele was associated with advanced stage of 
hepatic fibrosis (P = 0.003).
