Neurexins constitute a large family of synaptic organizers. Their extracellular 
domains protrude into the synaptic cleft where they can form transsynaptic 
bridges with different partners. A unique constellation of structural elements 
within their ectodomains enables neurexins to create molecular platforms within 
the synaptic cleft that permit a large portfolio of partners to be recruited, 
assembled and their interactions to be dynamically regulated. Neurexins and 
their partners are implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases including autism 
spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Detailed understanding of the mechanisms 
that underlie neurexin interactions may in future guide the design of tools to 
manipulate synaptic connections and their function, in particular those involved 
in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disease.
