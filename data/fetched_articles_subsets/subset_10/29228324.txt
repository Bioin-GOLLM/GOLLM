Controlling translation initiation is an efficient way to regulate gene 
expression at the post-transcriptional level. However, current knowledge 
regarding regulatory proteins and their modes of controlling translation 
initiation is still limited. In this study, we employed tandem affinity 
purification and mass spectrometry to screen for unknown proteins associated 
with the translation initiation machinery. Ubiquitin specific peptidase 9, 
X-linked (USP9X), was identified as a novel binding partner, that interacts with 
the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) in a mRNA-independent 
manner. USP9X-deficient cells presented significantly impaired nascent protein 
synthesis, cap-dependent translation initiation and cellular proliferation. 
USP9X can selectively alter the translation of pro-oncogenic mRNAs, such as 
c-Myc and XIAP. Moreover, we found that eIF4A1, which is primarily ubiquitinated 
at Lys-369, is the substrate of USP9X. USP9X dysfunction increases the 
ubiquitination of eIF4A1 and enhances its degradation. Our results provide 
evidence that USP9X is a novel regulator of the translation initiation process 
via deubiquitination of eIF4A1, which offers new insight in understanding the 
pivotal role of USP9X in human malignancies and neurodevelopmental disorders.
