Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) function is described in terms of related gene 
expressions, diseases, and cancers as well as their polymorphisms. Potential 
modulators of lncRNA function, including clinical drugs, natural products, and 
derivatives, are discussed, and bioinformatic resources are summarized. The 
improving knowledge of the lncRNA regulatory network has implications not only 
in gene expression, diseases, and cancers, but also in the development of 
lncRNA-based pharmacology.
