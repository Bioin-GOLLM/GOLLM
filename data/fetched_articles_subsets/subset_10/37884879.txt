BACKGROUND: Without effective intervention, primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) 
causes oxalate-induced kidney damage, leading to end-stage kidney disease and 
serious complications throughout the body. Although PH1 carries a heavy burden 
that impacts quality of life, literature on the experiences of those living with 
PH1 and caring for patients with PH1 is limited. This study aimed to describe 
the diagnostic journey in PH1 and characterize patients' and caregivers' 
self-reported experiences throughout the disease course.
METHODS: This was an observational study involving in-depth, semi-structured 
telephone interviews. Dominant trends were assessed using constant comparative 
analysis to identify themes in interviewees' descriptions of their experiences. 
Individuals aged ≥ 12 years and caregivers of children aged 6-17 years with 
genetically confirmed PH1 were eligible. Informed consent/assent and ability to 
read and speak English were required.
RESULTS: Interviewees (16 patients, 12 caregivers) reported a prolonged 
diagnostic journey due to low disease awareness, among other factors. Upon 
diagnosis, PH1 was frequently symptomatic, typically involving kidney 
stone-related symptoms but also potentially symptoms arising beyond the kidneys. 
PH1 most commonly led to worry and social impairment in adolescents, impaired 
physical function in adults, and a range of impacts on caregivers. In late-stage 
disease, dialysis was the most burdensome aspect of living with PH1 (due to time 
requirements, limitations from living with a catheter, etc.), and this burden 
was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Benefits desired from PH1 management 
included reductions in laboratory measures of oxalate burden, kidney stone and 
urination frequency, and oxalate-related skin ulcers.
CONCLUSIONS: PH1 greatly impacts patients' and caregivers' lives, primarily due 
to burdensome disease manifestations and associated emotional, physical, and 
practical impacts, as well as disease management challenges - particularly those 
related to dialysis in late-stage disease.
