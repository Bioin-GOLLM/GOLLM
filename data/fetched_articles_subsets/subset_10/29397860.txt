Essential thrombocythemia(ET) is one of the Ph chromosome-negative 
myeloproliferative neoplasms. Some studies discovered that the mutation of JAK2 
V617F existed in 50%-70% patients with ET. Recently, many significant advances 
in researches about pathogenesis of ET, such as mutations of JAK2V617F, MPL, 
CALR and other related mutation; the epigenetic abnomalities in incidence of ET; 
the changes of bone marrow microenvironment of ET and the regulation of related 
cytokines were obtained. In this article, the advances of above mentioned 
aspects of ET are summarized.
