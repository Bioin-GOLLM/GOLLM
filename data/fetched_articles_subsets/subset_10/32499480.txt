FinO-domain proteins are a widespread family of bacterial RNA-binding proteins 
with regulatory functions. Their target spectrum ranges from a single RNA pair, 
in the case of plasmid-encoded FinO, to global RNA regulons, as with 
enterobacterial ProQ. To assess whether the FinO domain itself is intrinsically 
selective or promiscuous, we determine in vivo targets of Neisseria 
meningitidis, which consists of solely a FinO domain. UV-CLIP-seq identifies 
associations with 16 small non-coding sRNAs and 166 mRNAs. Meningococcal ProQ 
predominantly binds to highly structured regions and generally acts to stabilize 
its RNA targets. Loss of ProQ alters transcript levels of >250 genes, 
demonstrating that this minimal ProQ protein impacts gene expression globally. 
Phenotypic analyses indicate that ProQ promotes oxidative stress resistance and 
DNA damage repair. We conclude that FinO domain proteins recognize some abundant 
type of RNA shape and evolve RNA binding selectivity through acquisition of 
additional regions that constrain target recognition.
