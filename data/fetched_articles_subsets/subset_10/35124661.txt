DJ-1 mutations are rare causes of autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's 
disease (AR-EOPD) and relatively rarely reported in the Chinese population. 
Here, we used the whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing to investigate 
DJ-1 mutations in the Chinese population and confirmed the pathogenicity of the 
mutation using primary fibroblasts established from skin biopsies. We identified 
a novel homozygous mutation (c.390delA, p.D131Tfs*3) in DJ-1 in a consanguineous 
Chinese family. The proband in this family had parkinsonism at the age of 22. 
His brain MRI indicated brain iron accumulation in the basal ganglia and 
cerebellum. The novel mutation caused DJ-1 protein deficiency, led to 
mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibited cell proliferation, and anti-oxidant 
defense.
