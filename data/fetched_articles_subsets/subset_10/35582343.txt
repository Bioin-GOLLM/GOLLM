Recently, several methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection have been developed to obtain 
rapid, portable, cheap, and easy-to-use diagnostic tools. This review paper 
summarizes and discusses studies on the development of point-of-care devices for 
SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis with comparisons between them from several aspects. Various 
detection methods of the recently developed portable COVID-19 biosensor will be 
presented in this review. The discussion is divided into four major 
classifications based on the target biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2, such as 
antibodies, nucleic acids, antigens, and metabolic products. An overview of the 
potential development for future study is also provided. Moreover, basic 
knowledge of biosensors is also explained for tutoring the implementation of 
theory into the research of COVID-19 biosensors. This review paper is aimed to 
provide a tutorial by collecting the information on the development of a 
point-of-care device for SARS-CoV-2 detection to provide information for further 
research and propose the new COVID-19 portable diagnostic tool.
