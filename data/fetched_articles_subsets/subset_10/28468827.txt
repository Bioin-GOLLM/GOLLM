Contributions of metabolic changes to cancer development and maintenance have 
received increasing attention in recent years. Although many human cancers share 
similar metabolic alterations, it remains unclear whether oncogene-specific 
metabolic alterations are required for tumor development. Using an RNAi-based 
screen targeting the majority of the known metabolic proteins, we recently found 
that oncogenic BRAFV600E up-regulates HMG-CoA lyase (HMGCL), which converts 
HMG-CoA to acetyl-CoA and a ketone body, acetoacetate, that selectively enhances 
BRAFV600E-dependent MEK1 activation in human cancer. Here, we identified HMG-CoA 
synthase 1 (HMGCS1), the upstream ketogenic enzyme of HMGCL, as an additional 
"synthetic lethal" partner of BRAFV600E Although HMGCS1 expression did not 
correlate with BRAFV600E mutation in human melanoma cells, HMGCS1 was 
selectively important for proliferation of BRAFV600E-positive melanoma and colon 
cancer cells but not control cells harboring active N/KRAS mutants, and stable 
knockdown of HMGCS1 only attenuated colony formation and tumor growth potential 
of BRAFV600E melanoma cells. Moreover, cytosolic HMGCS1 that co-localized with 
HMGCL and BRAFV600E was more important than the mitochondrial HMGCS2 isoform in 
BRAFV600E-expressing cancer cells in terms of acetoacetate production. 
Interestingly, HMGCL knockdown did not affect HMGCS1 expression levels, whereas 
HMGCS1 knockdown caused a compensating increase in HMGCL protein level because 
of attenuated protein degradation. However, this increase did not reverse the 
reduced ketogenesis in HMGCS1 knockdown cells. Mechanistically, HMGCS1 
inhibition decreased intracellular acetoacetate levels, leading to reduced 
BRAFV600E-MEK1 binding and consequent MEK1 activation. We conclude that the 
ketogenic HMGCS1-HMGCL-acetoacetate axis may represent a promising therapeutic 
target for managing BRAFV600E-positive human cancers.
