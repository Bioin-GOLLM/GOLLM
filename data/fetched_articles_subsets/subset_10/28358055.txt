The RNA-binding protein FUS participates in several RNA biosynthetic processes 
and has been linked to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
and frontotemporal dementia. Here we report that FUS controls back-splicing 
reactions leading to circular RNA (circRNA) production. We identified circRNAs 
expressed in in vitro-derived mouse motor neurons (MNs) and determined that the 
production of a considerable number of these circRNAs is regulated by FUS. Using 
RNAi and overexpression of wild-type and ALS-associated FUS mutants, we directly 
correlate the modulation of circRNA biogenesis with alteration of FUS nuclear 
levels and with putative toxic gain of function activities. We also demonstrate 
that FUS regulates circRNA biogenesis by binding the introns flanking the 
back-splicing junctions and that this control can be reproduced with artificial 
constructs. Most circRNAs are conserved in humans and specific ones are 
deregulated in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MNs carrying the 
FUSP525L mutation associated with ALS.
