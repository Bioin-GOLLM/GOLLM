Although alkynes are one of the smallest functional groups, they are among the 
most versatile building blocks for organic chemistry, with applications ranging 
from biochemistry to material sciences. Alkynylation reactions have 
traditionally relied on the use of acetylenes as nucleophiles. The discovery and 
development of ethynyl hypervalent iodine reagents have allowed to greatly 
expand the transfer of alkynes as electrophilic synthons. In this feature 
article the progress in the field since 2018 will be presented. After a short 
introduction on alkynylation reactions and hypervalent iodine reagents, the 
developments in the synthesis of alkynyl hypervalent iodine reagents will be 
discussed. Their recent use in base-mediated and transition-metal catalyzed 
alkynylations will be described. Progress in radical-based alkynylations and 
atom-economical transformations will then be presented.
