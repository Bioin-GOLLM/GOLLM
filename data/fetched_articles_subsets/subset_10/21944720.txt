Cyclin E is a component of the core cell cycle machinery, and it drives cell 
proliferation by regulating entry and progression of cells through the DNA 
synthesis phase. Cyclin E expression is normally restricted to proliferating 
cells. However, high levels of cyclin E are expressed in the adult brain. The 
function of cyclin E in quiescent, postmitotic nervous system remains unknown. 
Here we use a combination of in vivo quantitative proteomics and analyses of 
cyclin E knockout mice to demonstrate that in terminally differentiated neurons 
cyclin E forms complexes with Cdk5 and controls synapse function by restraining 
Cdk5 activity. Ablation of cyclin E led to a decreased number of synapses, 
reduced number and volume of dendritic spines, and resulted in impaired synaptic 
plasticity and memory formation in cyclin E-deficient animals. These results 
reveal a cell cycle-independent role for a core cell cycle protein, cyclin E, in 
synapse function and memory.
