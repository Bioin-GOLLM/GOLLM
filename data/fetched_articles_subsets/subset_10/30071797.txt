The association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes encoding 
transport proteins involved in the bio-disposition of tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (TDF) and kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD) in HIV-positive patients was 
examined in this study. Fifty-eight patients who received TDF were screened for 
KTD using retinol-binding protein (RBP) concentration in urine. We defined KTD 
as the top quartile of urinary RBP/creatinine ratio (>17 μg/mmol), regardless of 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or proteinuria. Genotyping of genes 
encoding transport proteins involved in the disposition of TDF was undertaken 
using validated Taqman 5' nuclease assays. Patients with KTD (N = 15) had higher 
current CD4 cell counts, lower eGFR and were less likely to possess the genotype 
CC at position 24 of the ABBC2 (MRP2, rs717620) gene. In multivariate analysis, 
genotype CC at position 24 of the ABBC2 gene was significantly associated with 
KTD (odds ratio =0.05, 95% confidence interval = 0.003-0.7, P = 0.027). Genotype 
CC at position 24 of the ABBC2 (MRP2 rs717620) gene was significantly associated 
with a reduced risk of elevated urinary RBP in HIV-positive patients exposed to 
TDF.
