A meta-analysis of the association between CTLA-4 +49 A/G, -318 C/T, and IL-1 
polymorphisms and susceptibility to cervical cancer.

Our aim was to explore whether cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and 
interleukin-1 (IL-1) polymorphisms are associated with cervical cancer. A 
meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the CTLA-4 +49 A/G, -318 
C/T, IL-1B -511 C/T, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) polymorphisms and 
cervical cancer.We included 15 studies on cervical cancer. The meta-analysis 
showed a significant association between cervical cancer and the CTLA-4 +49 G 
allele when all studies were considered (OR = 0.822, 95% CI 0.731-0.924, p = 
0.001). Stratification by ethnicity indicated an association between the CTLA-4 
+49 GG+GA genotype and cervical cancer in East Asians (OR = 0.708, 95% CI 
0.532-0.943, p = 0.018). However, no association was found between cervical 
cancer and the CTLA-4 -318 C/T polymorphism. Meta-analysis showed an association 
between cervical cancer and the IL-1B -511 T allele (OR = 1.380, 95% CI 
1.048-1.816, p= 0.022), and stratification by ethnicity indicated an association 
between the IL-1B -511 CC+CT genotype in East Asians (OR = 1.622, 95% CI 
1.227-2.43, p = 0.001). An association was found between the IL-1RN*2 allele and 
cervical cancer in Indians, but not in Europeans (OR = 2.154, 95% CI 
1.547-2.948, p = 1.6 × 10-7; OR = 1.269, 95% CI 0.969-1.661, p= 0.083). The 
meta-analysis suggests that the CTLA-4 +49 A/G and IL-1B -511 C/T polymorphisms 
are associated with cervical cancer in East Asians, and that the IL-1RN VNTR 
polymorphism is associated with cervical cancer in Indians.
