Manganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) has been previously used 
to determine the effect of acute cocaine on calcium-dependent synaptic activity 
in male rats. However, there have been no MEMRI studies examining sex 
differences in the functional neural circuits affected by repeated cocaine. In 
the present study, we used MEMRI to investigate the effects of repeated cocaine 
on brain activation in female and male rats. Adult female and male rats were 
scanned at 4.7 Tesla three days after final treatment with saline, a single 
cocaine injection (15 mg kg-1, i.p. × 1 day) or repeated cocaine injections 
(15 mg kg-1, i.p. × 10 days). A day before imaging rats were provided with an 
i.p. injection of manganese chloride (70 mg kg-1). Cocaine produced effects on 
MEMRI activity that were dependent on sex. In females, we observed that a single 
cocaine injection reduced MEMRI activity in hippocampal CA3, ventral tegmental 
area (VTA), and median Raphé, whereas repeated cocaine increased MEMRI activity 
in dentate gyrus and interpeduncular nucleus. In males, repeated cocaine reduced 
MEMRI activity in VTA. Overall, it appeared that female rats showed a general 
trend towards increase MEMRI activity with single cocaine and reduced activity 
with repeated exposure, while male rats showed a trend towards opposite effects. 
Our results provide evidence for sex differences in the in vivo neural response 
to cocaine, which involves primarily hippocampal, amygdala and midbrain areas.
