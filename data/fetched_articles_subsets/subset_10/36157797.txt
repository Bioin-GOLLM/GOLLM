BACKGROUND: The mitochondrial respiratory chain defects have become the most 
common cause of neurometabolic disorders in children and adults, which can occur 
at any time in life, often associated with neurological dysfunction, and lead to 
chronic disability and premature death. Approximately one-third of patients with 
mitochondrial disease have biochemical defects involving multiple respiratory 
chain complexes, suggesting defects in protein synthesis within the 
mitochondria. We here report a child with VARS2 gene mutations causing 
mitochondrial disease.
CASE SUMMARY: A girl, aged 3 years and 4 mo, had been unable to sit and crawl 
alone since birth, with obvious seizures and microcephaly. Brain magnetic 
resonance imaging showed symmetrical, flaky, long T1-weighted and low 
T2-weighted signals in the posterior part of the bilateral putamen with a high 
signal shadow. T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging showed a slightly 
high signal and diffusion-weighted imaging showed an obvious high signal. 
Whole-exome gene sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in the 
VARS2 gene, c.1163(exon11)C>T and c.1940(exon20)C>T, which was derived from the 
parents. The child was diagnosed with combined oxidative phosphorylation 
deficiency type 20.
CONCLUSION: In this patient, mitochondrial disorders including Leigh syndrome 
and MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and 
stroke-like episodes) were ruled out, and combined oxidative phosphorylation 
deficiency type 20 was diagnosed, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of the 
disease.
