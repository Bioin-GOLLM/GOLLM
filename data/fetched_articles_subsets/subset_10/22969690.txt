In the title compound, C(29)H(24)O, the phenyl and methyl-phenyl rings are 
approximately perpendicular to each other, making a dihedral angle of 
87.67 (10)°, and are oriented at dihedral angles of 62.49 (9) and 84.77 (7)°, 
respectively, to the nearly planar fluorene ring system [maximum deviation = 
0.077 (2) Å] In the crystal, weak C-H⋯π inter-actions are observed.
