We previously developed Cdh23 mutant mice (erl mice) as a model of hearing loss 
for otoprotective drug evaluation and showed that the erl mutation leads to 
hearing loss related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cochlear hair 
cell apoptosis. Small molecular chemical chaperones, 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), 
targeting ER stress exert a neuroprotective effect. To evaluate whether 4PBA 
exerts an otoprotective effect, we intraperitoneally injected erl mice with 4PBA 
daily from postnatal age day 7 up to 12 weeks. Our results showed that treatment 
with 4PBA significantly alleviated hearing loss and suppressed hair cell death 
in erl mice. In addition, ER stress-related proteins were downregulated by 4PBA 
treatment. Our study showed that 4PBA exerts an otoprotective effect, which 
provides the potential to repurpose the drug for otoprotection.
