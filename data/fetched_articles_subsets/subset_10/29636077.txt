BACKGROUND: MiR-182-5p, as a member of miRNA family, can be detected in lung 
cancer and plays an important role in lung cancer. To explore the clinical value 
of miR-182-5p in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and to unveil the molecular 
mechanism of LUSC.
METHODS: The clinical value of miR-182-5p in LUSC was investigated by collecting 
and calculating data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-qPCR). Twelve prediction platforms were used to predict the target 
genes of miR-182-5p. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and gene 
ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were 
used to explore the molecular mechanism of LUSC.
RESULTS: The expression of miR-182-5p was significantly over-expressed in LUSC 
than in non-cancerous tissues, as evidenced by various approaches, including the 
TCGA database, GEO microarrays, RT-qPCR, and a comprehensive meta-analysis of 
501 LUSC cases and 148 non-cancerous cases. Furthermore, a total of 81 potential 
target genes were chosen from the union of predicted genes and the TCGA 
database. GO and KEGG analyses demonstrated that the target genes are involved 
in pathways related to biological processes. PPIs revealed the relationships 
between these genes, with EPAS1, PRKCE, NR3C1, and RHOB being located in the 
center of the PPI network.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-182-5p upregulation greatly contributes to LUSC and may serve 
as a biomarker in LUSC.
