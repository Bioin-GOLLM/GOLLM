Assessing the CRC subtypes that can predict the outcome of colorectal cancer 
(CRC) in patients with immunogenicity seems to be a promising strategy to 
develop new drugs that target the antitumoral immune response. In particular, 
the disinhibition of the antitumoral T-cell response by immune checkpoint 
blockade has shown remarkable therapeutic promise for patients with mismatch 
repair (MMR) deficient CRC. In this review, the authors provide the update of 
the molecular features and immunogenicity of CRC, discuss the role of possible 
predictive biomarkers, illustrate the modern immunotherapeutic approaches, and 
introduce the most relevant ongoing preclinical study and clinical trials such 
as the use of the combination therapy with immunotherapy. Furthermore, this work 
is further to understand the complex interactions between the immune 
surveillance and develop resistance in tumor cells. As expected, if the promise 
of these developments is fulfilled, it could develop the effective therapeutic 
strategies and novel combinations to overcome immune resistance and enhance 
effector responses, which guide clinicians toward a more "personalized" 
treatment for advanced CRC patients.
