Riboflavin transporter 3 (RFVT3), encoded by the SLC52A3 gene, is important for 
riboflavin homeostasis in the small intestine, kidney, and placenta. Our 
previous study demonstrated that Slc52a3 knockout (Slc52a3-/-) mice exhibited 
neonatal lethality and metabolic disorder due to riboflavin deficiency. Here, we 
investigated the influence of Slc52a3 gene disruption on brain development using 
Slc52a3-/- embryos. Slc52a3-/- mice at postnatal day 0 showed hypoplasia of the 
brain and reduced thickness of cortical layers. At embryonic day 13.5, the 
formation of Tuj1+ neurons and Tbr2+ intermediate neural progenitors was 
significantly decreased; no significant difference was observed in the total 
number and proliferative rate of Pax6+ radial glia. Importantly, the hypoplastic 
phenotype was rescued upon riboflavin supplementation. Thus, it can be concluded 
that RFVT3 contributes to riboflavin homeostasis in embryos and that riboflavin 
itself is required during embryonic development of the cerebral cortex in mice.
