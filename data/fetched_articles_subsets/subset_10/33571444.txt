Skeletal aging is a complex process, characterized by a decrease in bone 
formation, an increase in marrow fat, and stem cell exhaustion. Loss of H3K9me3, 
a heterochromatin mark, has been proposed to be associated with aging. Here, we 
report that loss of KDM4B in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exacerbated 
skeletal aging and osteoporosis by reducing bone formation and increasing marrow 
adiposity via increasing H3K9me3. KDM4B epigenetically coordinated 
β-catenin/Smad1-mediated transcription by removing repressive H3K9me3. 
Importantly, KDM4B ablation impaired MSC self-renewal and promoted MSC 
exhaustion by inducing senescence-associated heterochromatin foci formation, 
providing a mechanistic explanation for stem cell exhaustion with aging. 
Moreover, while KDM4B was required for parathyroid hormone-mediated bone 
anabolism, KDM4B depletion accelerated bone loss and marrow adiposity induced by 
a high-fat diet. Our results suggest that the epigenetic rejuvenation and 
reversing bone-fat imbalance might be new strategies for preventing and treating 
skeletal aging and osteoporosis by activating KDM4B in MSCs.
