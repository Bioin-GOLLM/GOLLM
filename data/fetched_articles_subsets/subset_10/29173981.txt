Mutations in GBA1 encountered in Gaucher disease are a leading risk factor for 
Parkinson disease and associated Lewy body disorders. Many GBA1 mutation 
carriers, especially those with severe or null GBA1 alleles, have earlier and 
more progressive parkinsonism. To model the effect of partial glucocerebrosidase 
deficiency on neurological progression in vivo, mice with a human A53T 
α-synuclein (SNCAA53T) transgene were crossed with heterozygous null gba mice 
(gba+/-). Survival analysis of 84 mice showed that in gba+/-//SNCAA53T 
hemizygotes and homozygotes, the symptom onset was significantly earlier than in 
gba+/+//SNCAA53T mice (p-values 0.023-0.0030), with exacerbated disease 
progression (p-value <0.0001). Over-expression of SNCAA53T had no effect on 
glucocerebrosidase levels or activity. Immunoblotting demonstrated that gba 
haploinsufficiency did not lead to increased levels of either monomeric SNCA or 
insoluble high molecular weight SNCA in this model. Immunohistochemical analyses 
demonstrated that the abundance and distribution of SNCA pathology was also 
unaltered by gba haploinsufficiency. Thus, while the underlying mechanism is not 
clear, this model shows that gba deficiency impacts the age of onset and disease 
duration in aged SNCAA53T mice, providing a valuable resource to identify 
modifiers, pathways and possible moonlighting roles of glucocerebrosidase in 
Parkinson pathogenesis.
