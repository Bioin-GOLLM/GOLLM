BACKGROUND: The International Lung Cancer Consortium was established in 2004. To 
clarify the role of DNA repair genes in lung cancer susceptibility, we conducted 
a pooled analysis of genetic variants in DNA repair pathways, whose associations 
have been investigated by at least 3 individual studies.
METHODS: Data from 14 studies were pooled for 18 sequence variants in 12 DNA 
repair genes, including APEX1, OGG1, XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3, ERCC1, XPD, XPF, XPG, 
XPA, MGMT, and TP53. The total number of subjects included in the analysis for 
each variant ranged from 2,073 to 13,955 subjects.
RESULTS: Four of the variants were found to be weakly associated with lung 
cancer risk with borderline significance: these were XRCC3 T241M [heterozygote 
odds ratio (OR), 0.89; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.79-0.99 and 
homozygote OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-1.00] based on 3,467 cases and 5,021 controls 
from 8 studies, XPD K751Q (heterozygote OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.89-1.10 and 
homozygote OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39) based on 6,463 cases and 6,603 controls 
from 9 studies, and TP53 R72P (heterozygote OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.29 and 
homozygote OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.42) based on 3,610 cases and 5,293 controls 
from 6 studies. OGG1 S326C homozygote was suggested to be associated with lung 
cancer risk in Caucasians (homozygote OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01-1.79) based on 
2,569 cases and 4,178 controls from 4 studies but not in Asians. The other 14 
variants did not exhibit main effects on lung cancer risk.
DISCUSSION: In addition to data pooling, future priorities of International Lung 
Cancer Consortium include coordinated genotyping and multistage validation for 
ongoing genome-wide association studies.
