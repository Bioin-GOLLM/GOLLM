Early-life factors including preterm birth and VLBW increase the risk of 
hypertension, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Reductions in the 
anti-aging protein α-klotho are associated with hypertension, possibly due to 
angiotensin (Ang) II activation, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood 
and clinical evidence is lacking. The association of α-klotho with the 
alternative Ang-(1-7) pathway, which counteracts Ang II to lower BP, is 
undescribed. We hypothesized that lower urinary α-klotho is associated with 
higher BP and lower urinary Ang-(1-7) in preterm-born VLBW young adults. In a 
cross-sectional analysis of data from a prospective cohort of 141 preterm-born 
VLBW young adults, we assessed the associations among urinary 
α-klotho/creatinine, Ang II/creatinine, Ang-(1-7)/creatinine, Ang II/Ang-(1-7), 
and BP using generalized linear models adjusted for age and hypertensive 
pregnancy and conducted a sensitivity analysis in 32 term-born young adults. 
Among those born preterm, lower α-klotho/creatinine was associated with higher 
systolic BP (adjusted β (aβ): -2.58 mm Hg, 95% CI -4.99 to -0.17), lower 
Ang-(1-7)/creatinine (ln aβ: 0.1, 0.04-0.16), and higher Ang II/Ang-(1-7) (ln 
aβ: -0.14, -0.21 to -0.07). In term-born participants, α-klotho/creatinine was 
inversely associated with Ang II/creatinine (ln aβ: -0.15, -0.27 to -0.03) and 
Ang II/Ang-(1-7) (ln aβ: -0.15, -0.27 to -0.03). In preterm-born young adults 
with VLBW, lower urinary α-klotho/creatinine was associated with higher SBP, 
lower urinary Ang-(1-7)/creatinine, and higher urinary Ang II/Ang-(1-7). Reduced 
renal α-klotho expression could lead to renal Ang-(1-7) suppression as a novel 
mechanism for the development of hypertension among individuals born preterm 
with VLBW.
