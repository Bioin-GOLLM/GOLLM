Mutations in LRP5 and BMP4 are associated with mesiodens, tooth agenesis, root 
malformation, and oral exostoses.

WNT/β-catenin and BMP signaling pathways play important roles in the process of 
tooth development. Dysregulation of WNT/β-catenin and BMP signaling is 
implicated in a number of human malformations, including dental anomalies. Whole 
exome and Sanger sequencing identified seven patients with LRP5 mutations 
(p.Asn1121Asp, p.Asp856Asn, p.Val1433Met, and p.Val1245Met) and six patients 
with BMP4 mutations (p.Asn150Lys, p.Gly168Arg, p.Arg269Gln, and p.Ala42Glu). All 
patients were affected with isolated dental anomalies (dental anomalies with no 
other structural defects), including mesiodens, tooth agenesis, unseparated 
roots, narrow roots, shortened and tapered roots, and taurodontism. Five 
patients with LRP5 and one with BMP4 mutations had oral exostoses. Protein 
models of LRP5 mutations indicate the possible functional effects of the 
mutations. Here we report for the first time that mutations in LRP5 are 
associated with dental anomalies. LRP5 appears to be the first gene related to 
pathogenesis of mesiodens. We also show for the first time that in addition to 
tooth agenesis, mutations in BMP4 are also implicated in root maldevelopment and 
torus mandibularis. Sharing of the phenotypes of the patients with LRP5 and BMP4 
mutations, which include root maldevelopment, tooth agenesis, and torus 
mandibularis, implicates cross talks between the WNT/β-catenin and BMP signaling 
pathways, especially during root development.
