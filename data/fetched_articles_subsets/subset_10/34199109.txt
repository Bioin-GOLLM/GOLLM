Ovarian failure (OF) is a common cause of infertility usually diagnosed as 
idiopathic, with genetic causes accounting for 10-25% of cases. Whole-exome 
sequencing (WES) may enable identifying contributing genes and variant profiles 
to stratify the population into subtypes of OF. This study sought to identify a 
blood-based gene variant profile using accumulation of rare variants to promote 
precision medicine in fertility preservation programs. A case-control (n = 118, 
n = 32, respectively) WES study was performed in which only non-synonymous rare 
variants <5% minor allele frequency (MAF; in the IGSR) and coverage ≥ 100× were 
considered. A profile of 66 variants of uncertain significance was used for 
training an unsupervised machine learning model to separate cases from controls 
(97.2% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity) and stratify the population into two 
subtypes of OF (A and B) (93.31% sensitivity, 96.67% specificity). Model testing 
within the IGSR female population predicted 0.5% of women as subtype A and 2.4% 
as subtype B. This is the first study linking OF to the accumulation of rare 
variants and generates a new potential taxonomy supporting application of this 
approach for precision medicine in fertility preservation.
