Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized 
by motor neuron loss that ultimately leads to fatal paralysis. Reducing levels 
or function of the tyrosine kinase, ephrin type-A receptor 4 (EphA4), has been 
suggested as a potential approach for slowing disease progression in ALS. 
Because EphA4 plays roles in embryonic nervous system development, study of 
constitutive knockout (KO) of EphA4 in mice is limited due to confounding 
phenotypes with homozygous knockout. We used a tamoxifen-inducible EphA4 
conditional KO mouse to achieve strong reduction of EphA4 levels in postnatal 
mice to test for protective effects in the SOD1G93A model of ALS. We found that 
EphA4 KO in young mice, but not older adult mice, causes defects in muscle 
function, consistent with a prolonged postnatal role for EphA4 in adolescent 
muscle growth. When testing the effects of inducible EphA4 KO at different 
timepoints in SOD1G93A mice, we found no benefits on motor function or disease 
pathology, including muscle denervation and motor neuron loss. Our results 
demonstrate deleterious effects of reducing EphA4 levels in juvenile mice and do 
not provide support for the hypothesis that widespread EphA4 reduction is 
beneficial in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS.
