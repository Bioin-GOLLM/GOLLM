The relapse rate remains high after chemotherapy for adult patients with acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With better molecular diagnosis and classification 
as well as better assessment for minimal residual disease, major progress in the 
treatment for refractory and/or relapsed ALL is being made. In addition to the 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, 
immunotherapeutic agents, blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO), and 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, are changing the treatment paradigm for 
ALL. Blinatumomab and INO are being incorporated into induction chemotherapy 
regimens and combined with TKIs for ALL therapy. A novel low-intensity regimen, 
miniHCVD-INO-blinatumomab, appears to be less toxic and more effective than 
conventional intensive chemotherapy regimens. This review summarized new 
therapeutic researches of ALL and updated latest progress in clinical trials on 
bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and new regimens incorporating 
these novel antibodies.
