Neuroligins (NLs) are a family of neural cell-adhesion molecules that are 
involved in excitatory/inhibitory synapse specification. Multiple members of the 
NL family (including NL1) and their binding partners have been linked to cases 
of human autism and mental retardation. We have now characterized NL1-deficient 
mice in autism- and mental retardation-relevant behavioral tasks. NL1 knock-out 
(KO) mice display deficits in spatial learning and memory that correlate with 
impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation. In addition, NL1 KO mice exhibit a 
dramatic increase in repetitive, stereotyped grooming behavior, a potential 
autism-relevant abnormality. This repetitive grooming abnormality in NL1 KO mice 
is associated with a reduced NMDA/AMPA ratio at corticostriatal synapses. 
Interestingly, we further demonstrate that the increased repetitive grooming 
phenotype can be rescued in adult mice by administration of the NMDA receptor 
partial coagonist d-cycloserine. Broadly, these data are consistent with a role 
of synaptic cell-adhesion molecules in general, and NL1 in particular, in autism 
and implicate reduced excitatory synaptic transmission as a potential mechanism 
and treatment target for repetitive behavioral abnormalities.
