Gastric bypass surgery (GBP), in addition to weight loss, results in dramatic 
remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The mechanisms by which this remission 
occurs are unclear. Besides weight loss and caloric restriction, the changes in 
gut hormones that occur after GBP are increasingly gaining recognition as key 
players in glucose control. Incretins are gut peptides that stimulate insulin 
secretion postprandially; the levels of these hormones, particularly 
glucagon-like peptide-1, increase after GBP in response to nutrient stimulation. 
Whether these changes are causal to changes in glucose homeostasis remain to be 
determined. The purpose of this review is to assess the evidence on incretin 
changes and T2DM remission after GBP, and the possible mechanisms by which these 
changes occur. Our goals are to provide a thorough update on this field of 
research so that recommendations for future research and criteria for bariatric 
surgery can be evaluated.
