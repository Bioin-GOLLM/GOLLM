The 5HT2A (5HTR2A) and 5HT1A receptor (5HTR1A) genes are plausible candidate 
genes for major depressive disorders. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms, the 
rs7997012 in 5HTR2A and the -1019C/G in 5HTR1A, were analyzed in 206 patients 
with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition major 
depressive disorder. Patients were retrospectively characterized for clinical 
response to antidepressant treatment. We found a significant difference in the 
rs7997012 allele frequency between resistant and nonresistant patients. However, 
following the Bonferroni correction we could not find any association between 
this single nucleotide polymorphism and treatment resistance phenotype. 
Nevertheless, given the limited power of our analysis, we are not able to 
conclude that these results reflect a lack of association. Additional studies 
are needed to confirm or to disprove our result.
