Primordial dwarfism (PD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous 
condition. Various molecular mechanisms are known to underlie the disease 
including impaired mitotic mechanics, abnormal IGF2 expression, perturbed DNA 
damage response, defective spliceosomal machinery, and abnormal replication 
licensing. Here, we describe a syndromic form of PD associated with severe 
intellectual disability and distinct facial features in a large multiplex Saudi 
family. Analysis reveals a novel underlying mechanism for PD involving depletion 
of 7SK, an abundant cellular noncoding RNA (ncRNA), due to mutation of its 
chaperone LARP7. We show that 7SK levels are tightly linked to LARP7 expression 
across cell lines, and that this chaperone is ubiquitously expressed in the 
mouse embryo. The 7SK is known to influence the expression of a wide array of 
genes through its inhibitory effect on the positive transcription elongation 
factor b (P-TEFb) as well as its competing role in HMGA1-mediated 
transcriptional regulation. This study documents a critical role played by ncRNA 
in human development and adds to the growing list of molecular mechanisms that, 
when perturbed, converge on the PD phenotype.
