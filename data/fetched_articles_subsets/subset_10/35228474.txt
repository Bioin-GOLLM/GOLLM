Objective Acute pulmonary lesions (APLs), defined as an acute infiltrate or 
nodular lung field, are a major complication in patients with haematological 
diseases. Recently, endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide-sheath (EBUS-GS) 
was established as a useful technique for diagnosing pulmonary lesions. This 
study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EBUS-GS for managing APLs in 
patients with haematological diseases. Methods Our single-centre, retrospective, 
observational, single-arm, descriptive study enrolled 22 consecutive adult 
(>20-year-old) patients with haematological diseases and concomitant APL who 
underwent EBUS-GS between January 2011 and June 2016 at Kameda Medical Center, 
Chiba, Japan. The primary endpoint was the contribution of EBUS-GS to clinical 
decision-making. Secondary endpoints were an adequate tissue collection rate, 
diagnostic yield, complication rate, and 30-day mortality. Results The median 
patient age was 70 years old, and 63.6% were men. Acute myeloid leukaemia was 
the most frequent underlying disease, accounting for 54.5% of patients. The 
contribution of EBUS-GS to clinical decision-making was recognised in 11 (50.0%) 
patients. Adequate tissue collection was achieved in 21 (95.5%) patients. The 
aetiology of the APL was identified in 9 (40.9%) patients. No complications, 
including severe haemorrhaging and pneumothorax, were observed in any patients, 
and the 30-day mortality rate was 0%. Conclusion EBUS-GS may be a suitable 
diagnostic option for APL in patients with haematological diseases. Further 
larger-scale and randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm our results.
