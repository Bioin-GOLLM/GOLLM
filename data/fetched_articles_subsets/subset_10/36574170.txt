The rarity and biological heterogeneity of the peripheral T-cell lymphomas has 
made subtype- and biomarker-driven approaches challenging to realize and even 
more challenging to evaluate in clinical practice. Out of necessity, treatment 
of T-cell lymphomas has historically been derivative of other aggressive 
lymphomas, utilizing intensive combination chemotherapy programs in the upfront 
setting and non-overlapping cytotoxic regimens upon relapse. However, due to 
tremendous work in understanding the oncogenic basis of these varied diseases, 
an increasing exploration of rational, targeted therapies is underway. Still, 
clinical successes have at times lagged behind pathobiological realizations, and 
there is an evolving need for biologically based, subtype-specific strategies in 
the clinic. Herein we propose a framework for future success that relies upon 
optimizing standard therapy in populations known to benefit from combination 
chemotherapy, building upon CHOP (or CHOP-like) induction with the CHOP + X 
model, exploring the use of targeted platforms in the relapsed and refractory 
setting, and designing biomarker-informed clinical trials that target-specific 
subhistologies and unique molecular subsets.
