BACKGROUND: Spinal chordomas, a subtype of primary spinal column malignancies 
(PSCM), are rare tumors with poor prognosis, and we have limited understanding 
of the molecular drivers of neoplasia.
METHODS: Study design was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data 
with cross-sectional survival. Archived paraffin embedded pathologic specimens 
were collected for 133 patients from 6 centers within Europe and North America 
between 1987 and 2012. Tumor DNA was extracted and the human telomerase reverse 
transcriptase (hTERT) promoter was sequenced. The hTERT mutational status was 
correlated with overall survival (OS) and time to first local recurrence.
RESULTS: Ninety-two chordomas, 26 chondrosarcomas, 7 osteosarcomas, 3 Ewing's 
sarcomas, and 5 other malignant spinal tumors were analyzed. Median OS following 
surgery was 5.8 years (95% CI: 4.6 to 6.9) and median time to first local 
recurrence was 3.9 years (95% CI: 2.5 to 6.7). Eight chordomas, 2 
chondrosarcomas, 1 Ewing's sarcoma, and 1 other malignant spinal tumor harbored 
either a C228T or C250T mutation in the hTERT promoter. In the overall cohort, 
all patients with hTERT mutation were alive at 10 years postoperative with a 
median OS of 5.1 years (95% CI: 4.5 to 6.6) (P = 0.03). hTERT promoter mutation 
was observed in 8.7% of spinal chordomas, and 100% of chordoma patients 
harboring the mutation were alive at 10 years postoperative compared with 67% 
patients without the mutation (P = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time that hTERT promoter mutations C228T 
and C250T are present in approximately 8.7% of spinal chordomas. The presence of 
hTERT mutations conferred a survival benefit and could potentially be a valuable 
positive prognostic molecular marker in spinal chordomas.
