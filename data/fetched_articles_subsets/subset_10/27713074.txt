Zoonotic A(H7N9) avian influenza viruses emerged in China in 2013 and continue 
to be a threat to human public health, having infected over 800 individuals with 
a mortality rate approaching 40%. Treatment options for people infected with 
A(H7N9) include the use of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. However, like other 
influenza viruses, A(H7N9) can become resistant to these drugs. The use of 
monoclonal antibodies is a rapidly developing strategy for controlling influenza 
virus infection. Here we generated a murine monoclonal antibody (3c10-3) 
directed against the NA of A(H7N9) and show that prophylactic systemic 
administration of 3c10-3 fully protected mice from lethal challenge with 
wild-type A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9). Further, post-infection treatment with a single 
systemic dose of 3c10-3 at either 24, 48 or 72 h post A(H7N9) challenge resulted 
in both dose- and time-dependent protection of up to 100% of mice, demonstrating 
therapeutic potential for 3c10-3. Epitope mapping revealed that 3c10-3 binds 
near the enzyme active site of NA, and functional characterization showed that 
3c10-3 inhibits the enzyme activity of NA and restricts the cell-to-cell spread 
of the virus in cultured cells. Affinity analysis also revealed that 3c10-3 
binds equally well to recombinant NA of wild-type A/Anhui/1/2013 and to a 
variant NA carrying a R289K mutation known to infer NAI resistance. These 
results suggest that 3c10-3 has the potential to be used as a therapeutic to 
treat A(H7N9) infections either as an alternative to, or in combination with, 
current NA antiviral inhibitors.
