Tocotrienol (T3), unsaturated vitamin E, is gaining a lot of attention owing to 
its potent anticancer effect, since its efficacy is much greater than that of 
tocopherol (Toc). Various factors are known to be involved in such antitumor 
action, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, antiangiogenesis, 
anti-metastasis, nuclear factor-κB suppression, and telomerase inhibition. Owing 
to a difference in the affinity of T3 and Toc for the α-tocopherol transfer 
protein, the bioavailability of orally ingested T3 is lower than that of Toc. 
Furthermore, cellular uptake of T3 is interrupted by coadministration of α-Toc 
in vitro and in vivo. Based on this, several studies are in progress to screen 
for molecules that can synergize with T3 in order to augment its potency. 
Combinations of T3 with chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., statins, celecoxib, and 
gefitinib) or dietary components (e.g., polyphenols, sesamin, and ferulic acid) 
exhibit synergistic actions on cancer cell growth and signaling pathways. In 
this review, we summarize the current status of synergistic effects of T3 and an 
array of agents on cancer cells, and discuss their molecular mechanisms of 
action. These combination strategies would encourage further investigation and 
application in cancer prevention and therapy.
