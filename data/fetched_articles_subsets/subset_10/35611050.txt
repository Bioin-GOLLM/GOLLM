Peroxisomes and the ER are closely inter-connected organelles, which collaborate 
in the metabolism of lipids. In a recent research paper in the Journal of Cell 
Biology, we describe a novel mechanism by which peroxisome-ER membrane contact 
sites are regulated, via phosphorylation of the peroxisomal protein ACBD5. We 
found that the interaction between ACBD5 and the ER protein VAPB, which we have 
previously shown to form a tether complex at peroxisome-ER contacts, is 
controlled by phosphorylation of ACBD5 at two different sites of its FFAT motif 
- the VAPB binding site. We also identify the kinase GSK3-Î² as being responsible 
for direct phosphorylation of ACBD5 to negatively regulate interaction with 
VAPB, leading to reduced peroxisome-ER contacts. In this article we provide 
additional insights into how this work, in combination with other studies on 
phosphorylation of VAP interactors, suggests a complex system of both positive 
and negative regulation of the FFAT motif via phosphorylation.
