BACKGROUND: Mutations in genes encoding tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and 
interleukin (IL)-6 were previously shown to affect mortality. Single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the functional promoter regions of TNF-α (G308A) and 
IL-6 (G174C) are among the most widely studied.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether TNF-α G308A and IL-6 G174C SNPs confer 
susceptibility to longevity, we performed a meta-analysis to comprehensively 
estimate the association between these SNPs and longevity in long-lived 
individuals (LLI, aged ≥ 80 years).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies addressing the role of TNF-α and IL-6 SNPs in 
longevity were identified from the PubMed database. Pooled ORs with 95 % 
confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association between SNPs and 
longevity.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis was based on four studies of TNF-α G308A and nine of 
IL-6 G174C, covering a total of 2945 LLI individuals and 2992 controls. Overall, 
no significantly increased risks were observed for G308A [A vs. G (additive 
model): OR = 0.98, 95 % CI = 0.79-1.22, p = 0.852; AA + AG vs. GG (dominant 
model): OR = 0.97, 95 % CI = 0.75-1.24, p = 0.791] or for G174C [C vs. G 
(additive model): OR = 1.07, 95 % CI = 0.94-1.22, p = 0.293; CC + CG vs. GG 
(dominant model): OR = 1.09, 95 % CI = 0.93-1.28, p = 0.299]. There was no 
change in the significance when a cutoff age of ≥ 90 years was introduced.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that the TNF-α G308A and IL-6 G174C SNPs 
affected the probability of reaching an advanced age in Caucasians, and that 
they have little effect on delaying the onset and progression of age-related 
diseases, but this does not rule out the possibility of population-specific 
effects caused by different genes and/or environmental factors and their 
interactions.
