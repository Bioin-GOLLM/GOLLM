BACKGROUND: Volumetric evaluation of 99mTechnetium-pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP) 
SPECT/CT is a useful method for assessing transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis 
(ATTR-CA). We investigated the methodology and assessed its relationship with 
conventional parameters.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 99mTc-PYP SPECT/CT scans of 25 
patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy and/or gene testing. Fourteen (56%) 
patients were diagnosed with ATTR-CA. SPECT/CT images were acquired at 3 hours 
after injection. Total volumes of the myocardial regions where uptakes were 
> 1.2 and 1.4 × aortic blood pool SUVmax were evaluated and defined as cardiac 
pyrophosphate volume (CPV1.2 and CPV1.4). The heart-to-contralateral lung (H/CL) 
ratio and myocardial SUVmax were also calculated. CPV1.2 achieved the highest 
sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing ATTR-CA. In patients diagnosed with 
ATTR-CA (n = 14), CPV1.2 negatively correlated with left ventricular ejection 
fraction and positively correlated with left ventricular posterior wall 
thickness and QRS duration. The correlation was stronger in CPV1.2 than in the 
H/CL ratio and SUVmax.
CONCLUSION: Volumetric evaluation of 99mTc-PYP SPECT/CT may be superior to the 
H/CL ratio and SUVmax in assessing the disease burden of ATTR-CA. Larger studies 
are warranted to clarify whether volumetric measurement can assess prognosis and 
disease progression.
