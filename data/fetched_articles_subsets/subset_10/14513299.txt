This report describes a newborn boy with Antley-Bixler (AB) syndrome. AB 
syndrome is a rare disorder characterized mainly by craniosynostosis and 
multiple joint contractures including radiohumeral synostosis. Our patient 
differs from the usual presentation by the presence of radioulnar rather than a 
radiohumeral synostosis. In addition, the child had a FGFR1 1300T mutation, 
which has not previously been associated with AB syndrome. Thus, our patient 
presents unique features and represents another argument in favour of an AB-like 
spectrum rather than a single syndrome.
