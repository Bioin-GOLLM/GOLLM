BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Visceral hypersensitivity is common in patients with 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We investigated whether inflammatory molecules, 
such as histamine and proteases, activate prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 
(also called COX2) to increase the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by mast 
cells, which activates the receptor PTGER2 (also called EP2) in the dorsal root 
ganglia to promote visceral hypersensitivity.
METHODS: We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure levels of 
spontaneous release of molecules from mast cells in colonic mucosa from patients 
with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D; 18 women and 5 men; aged 28-60 years), healthy 
individuals (controls, n = 24), mice, and rats. We measured visceromotor 
responses to colorectal distension in rodents after intracolonic administration 
of colon biopsy supernatants, histamine, PGE2, a small interfering RNA against 
EP2, or an agonist of F2R like trypsin receptor 1 (F2RL1, also called 
protease-activated receptor 2 [PAR2]). We investigated the role of COX2, 
produced by mast cells, in mediation of visceral hypersensitivity using mice 
with the Y385F substitution in Ptgs2 (Ptgs2Y385F mice), mast cell-deficient 
(W/WV) mice, and W/WV mice given injections of mast cells derived from wild-type 
or Ptgs2Y385F mice.
RESULTS: Colon biopsies from patients with IBS-D had increased levels of PGE2, 
based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and COX2 messenger RNA and protein, 
compared with control biopsies. Immunohistochemistry showed that most of the 
COX2 was in mast cells. Intracolonic infusions of rats with IBS-D biopsy 
supernatants generated a 3- to 4-fold increase in visceromotor responses to 
colorectal distension; this was associated with significant increases in PGE2, 
histamine, and tryptase in the colonic mucosa. These increases were prevented by 
a mast cell stabilizer, COX2 inhibitor, or knockdown of EP2. Intracolonic 
administration of supernatants from biopsies of patients with IBS-D failed to 
induce visceral hypersensitivity or increase the level of PGE2 in W/WV and 
Ptgs2Y385Fmice. Reconstitution of mast cells in W/WV mice restored the visceral 
hypersensitivity response.
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal synthesis of PGE2 by colonic mast cells appears to induce 
visceral hypersensitivity in patients with IBS-D.
