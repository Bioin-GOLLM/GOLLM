No licensed human vaccines are currently available against leishmaniasis. 
Several anti-leishmanial vaccines are currently undergoing testing, including 
genetically modified live-attenuated parasite vaccines. Studies with live 
attenuated Leishmania vaccines such as centrin deleted Leishmania donovani 
parasites (LdCen -/-) showed protective immunity in animal models. Such studies 
typically examined the biomarkers of protective immunity however the biomarkers 
of attenuation in the parasite preparations have not received adequate 
attention. As several candidate vaccines enter clinical trials, a more complete 
product characterization to enable maintenance of product quality will help meet 
regulatory requirements. Towards this goal, we have determined the complete 
genome sequence of LdCen -/- and its parent strain Ld1S-2D (LdWT) and 
characterized the LdCen -/- vaccine strain using bioinformatics tools. Results 
showed that the LdCen -/- parasites, in addition to loss of the centrin gene, 
have additional deletions ranging from 350 bp to 6900 bp in non-contiguous loci 
on several chromosomes, most commonly in untranslated regions. We have 
experimentally verified a subset of these adventitious deletions that had no 
impact on the attenuation of the LdCen -/- parasites. Our results identified 
hitherto unknown features of attenuation of virulence that could be used as 
markers of product quality in production lots and highlight the importance of 
product characterization in parasitic vaccines.
