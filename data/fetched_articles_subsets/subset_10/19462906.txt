OBJECTIVE: To detect AKAP10 gene 2073A/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
genotyping by TaqMan probe real-time PCR.
METHODS: The genotype of AKAP10 gene 2073A/G was detected by real-time PCR with 
a pair of new-designed TaqMan probes. The PCR products also were subjected to 
gene sequence analysis to validate the results of TaqMan probe real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The TaqMan probe real-time PCR method was successfully developed to 
detect AKAP10 gene 2073A/G SNP. The results were accordant with those achieved 
by DNA sequencing. The distribution of AKAP10 gene 2073A/G among population had 
no relationship with gender, age (P > 0.05). Unconditional logistic regression 
analysis revealed that the variant genotypes (AG + GG) had a 52% increased risk 
of colorectal cancer, compared with the AA genotype (P = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: A detection platform for SNP genotyping by TaqMan probe was set up 
successfully. There was a significant association between AKAP10 gene 2073A/G 
and colorectal cancer.
