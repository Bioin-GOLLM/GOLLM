OBJECTIVE: Inducible nitric oxide synthase, a protein product of NOS2A, 
generates nitric oxide as a defense mechanism, but excessive levels threaten 
cellular survival. NOS2A is a candidate gene for Parkinson's disease (PD) that 
potentially interacts with cigarette smoking. We examined NOS2A for association 
with PD risk and age at onset (AAO) and for interaction with smoking.
METHODS: We genotyped 13 NOS2A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 466 
singleton families and in a validation set of 286 multiplex families. We tested 
allelic and haplotypic association using the association in the presence of 
linkage test, genotypic associations using the genotype pedigree disequilibrium 
test, AAO effects using the quantitative transmission disequilibrium test, and 
interactions using generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS: Among the pooled earliest onset families, rs2255929 and rs1060826 
generated significant allelic (p = 0.000059 and 0.0062, respectively) and 
genotypic (p = 0.0039 and 0.0014, respectively) associations with risk and AAO 
(p = 0.00070 and 0.0073, respectively); the two-SNP haplotype generated even 
stronger association with PD (p = 0.000013). Significant interactions with 
smoking (p = 0.0015 for rs 2255929 and p < 0.0001 for rs 1060826) were detected 
in a subset of the families; smoking was inversely associated with PD among risk 
allele noncarriers, but significance diminished among carriers.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings support NOS2A as a genetic risk factor in PD, 
potentially by influencing AAO and by modifying the inverse association between 
PD and smoking.
