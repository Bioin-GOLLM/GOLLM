Cyanobacteria and algae are becoming increasingly attractive cell factories for 
producing renewable biofuels and chemicals due to their ability to capture solar 
energy and CO(2) and their relatively simple genetic background for genetic 
manipulation. Increasing research efforts from the synthetic biology approach 
have been made in recent years to modify cyanobacteria and algae for various 
biotechnological applications. In this article, we critically review recent 
progresses in developing genetic tools for characterizing or manipulating 
cyanobacteria and algae, the applications of genetically modified strains for 
synthesizing renewable products such as biofuels and chemicals. In addition, the 
emergent challenges in the development and application of synthetic biology for 
cyanobacteria and algae are also discussed.
