Aging has long been considered as the main risk factor for several 
neurodegenerative disorders including a large group of diseases known as 
tauopathies. Even though neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) have been examined as 
the main histopathological hallmark, they do not seem to play a role as the 
toxic entities leading to disease. Recent studies suggest that an intermediate 
form of tau, prior to NFT formation, the tau oligomer, is the true toxic 
species. However, the mechanisms by which tau oligomers trigger 
neurodegeneration remain unknown. This review summarizes recent findings 
regarding the role of tau oligomers in disease, including release from cells, 
propagation from affected to unaffected brain regions, uptake into cells, and 
toxicity via mitochondrial dysfunction. A greater understanding of tauopathies 
may lead to future advancements in regards to prevention and treatment.
