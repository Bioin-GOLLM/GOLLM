Mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) bone marrow cells possess the potential to 
differentiate into a variety of mesenchymal tissue types and offer a source of 
easy access for obtaining stem cells for the development of experimental models 
with applications in tissue engineering. In the present work, we aimed to 
isolate by magnetic activated cell sorting CD90+ cells from MPB by means of the 
administration of Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor and to evaluate cell 
proliferation capacity, after thawing of the in vitro culture of this population 
of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in sheep. We obtained a median of 8.2 ± 0.6 
million of CD90+ cells from the 20-mL MPB sample. After thawing, at day 15 under 
in vitro culture, the mean CD90+ cells determined by flow cytometry was 92.92 ± 
1.29 % and cell duplication time determined by crystal violet staining was 47.59 
h. This study describes for the first time the isolation, characterization, and 
post-in vitro culture thawing of CD90+ MSCs from mobilized peripheral blood in 
sheep. This population can be considered as a source of MSCs for experimental 
models in tissue engineering research.
