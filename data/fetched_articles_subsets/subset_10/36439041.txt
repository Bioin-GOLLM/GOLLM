OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in fasting blood 
sugar (FBS) over time and its determinants in diabetic patients.
METHODS: A longitudinal data analysis retrospective-based study was considered 
with a sample of 312 patients, and the linear mixed effect model was applied.
RESULTS: Based on the linear mixed model, the 3-month change in time decreases 
the average FBS level by 0.0111. An increase of one unit of body mass index 
(BMI) increases the FBS level by 0.0434. Similarly, an increase in blood 
pressure (DBP) per unit increased the average log FBS level by 0.0005. Secondary 
and higher education levels lower log FBS levels by 99.41% and 99.45%, 
respectively, compared with noneducated individuals.
CONCLUSION: The study showed that hypertension history, type of diet, age, 
status of education, type of drug, body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, 
and time were statistically significant factors.
IMPLICATIONS: According to the study, eating a healthy diet, maintaining a 
healthy body weight, and a low blood sugar level are essential to controlling 
blood sugar and preventing long-term complications. The government should build 
an educational institution proportional to the population and open programs to 
increase awareness about the prevention mechanism of diabetes in communities.
