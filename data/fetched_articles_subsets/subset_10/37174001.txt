The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a key role in cancer development and 
progression, as well as contributes to the therapeutic resistance and metastasis 
of cancer cells. The TME is heterogeneous and consists of multiple cell types, 
including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, and immune 
cells, as well as various extracellular components. Recent studies have revealed 
cross talk between cancer cells and CAFs as well as between CAFs and other TME 
cells, including immune cells. Signaling by transforming growth factor-Î², 
derived from CAFs, has recently been shown to induce remodeling of tumor tissue, 
including the promotion of angiogenesis and immune cell recruitment. 
Immunocompetent mouse cancer models that recapitulate interactions of cancer 
cells with the TME have provided insight into the TME network and support the 
development of new anticancer therapeutic strategies. Recent studies based on 
such models have revealed that the antitumor action of molecularly targeted 
agents is mediated in part by effects on the tumor immune environment. In this 
review, we focus on cancer cell-TME interactions in heterogeneous tumor tissue, 
and we provide an overview of the basis for anticancer therapeutic strategies 
that target the TME, including immunotherapy.
