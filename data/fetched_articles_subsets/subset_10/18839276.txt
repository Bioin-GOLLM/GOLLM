Increase in fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) reduces globin chain imbalance in 
beta-thalassemia, consequently improving symptoms. QTL mapping together with 
previous genome-wide association study involving approximately 110,000 
gene-based SNPs in mild and severe beta(0)-thalassemia/Hb E patients revealed 
SNPs in HBS1L significantly associated with severity and Hb F levels. Given its 
potential as binding site for transcription factor activator protein 4, HBS1L 
exon 1 C32T polymorphism was genotyped in 455 cases, providing for the first 
time evidence that C allele is associated with elevated Hb F level among 
beta(0)-thalassemia/Hb E patients with XmnI-(G)gamma-/-and 
XmnI-(G)gamma+/-polymorphisms.
