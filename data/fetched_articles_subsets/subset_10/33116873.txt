Long noncoding (lnc)RNAs are a group of RNAs with a length greater than 200 nt 
that do not encode a protein but play an essential role in regulating the 
expression of target genes in normal biological contexts as well as pathologic 
processes including tumorigenesis. The lncRNA metastasis-associated lung 
adenocarcinoma transcript (MALAT)-1 has been widely studied in cancer. In this 
review, we describe the known functions of MALAT-1; its mechanisms of action; 
and associated signaling pathways and their clinical significance in different 
cancers. In most malignancies, including lung, colorectal, thyroid, and other 
cancers, MALAT-1 functions as an oncogene and is upregulated in tumors and tumor 
cell lines. MALAT-1 has a distinct mechanism of action in each cancer type and 
is thus at the center of large gene regulatory networks. Dysregulation of 
MALAT-1 affects cellular processes such as alternative splicing, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, apoptosis, and autophagy, which ultimately 
results in the abnormal cell proliferation, invasion, and migration that 
characterize cancers. In other malignancies, such as glioma and endometrial 
carcinoma, MALAT-1 functions as a tumor suppressor and thus forms additional 
regulatory networks. The current evidence indicates that MALAT-1 and its 
associated signaling pathways can serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarker or 
therapeutic target in the treatment of many cancers.
