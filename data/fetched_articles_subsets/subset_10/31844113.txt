The existence of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) is a major reason underlying 
cancer metastasis and recurrence after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Targeting 
BCSCs may ameliorate breast cancer relapse and therapy resistance. Here we 
report that expression of the pseudokinase Tribble 3 (TRIB3) positively 
associates with breast cancer stemness and progression. Elevated TRIB3 
expression supports BCSCs by interacting with AKT to interfere with the 
FOXO1-AKT interaction and suppress FOXO1 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and 
degradation by E3 ligases SKP2 and NEDD4L. The accumulated FOXO1 promotes 
transcriptional expression of SOX2, a transcriptional factor for cancer 
stemness, which in turn, activates FOXO1 transcription and forms a positive 
regulatory loop. Disturbing the TRIB3-AKT interaction suppresses BCSCs by 
accelerating FOXO1 degradation and reducing SOX2 expression in mouse models of 
breast cancer. Our study provides insights into breast cancer development and 
confers a potential therapeutic strategy against TRIB3-overexpressed breast 
cancer.
