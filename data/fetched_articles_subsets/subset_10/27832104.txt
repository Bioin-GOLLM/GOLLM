BACKGROUND: Despite the plethora of sequence variants in LRRK2, only a few 
clearly segregate with PD. Even within this group of pathogenic mutations, the 
phenotypic profile can differ widely.
OBJECTIVE: We examined multiple properties of LRRK2 behavior in cellular models 
over-expressing three sequence variants described in Greek PD patients in 
comparison to several known pathogenic and non-pathogenic LRRK2 mutations, to 
determine if specific phenotypes associated with pathogenic LRRK2 can be 
observed in other less-common sequence variants for which pathogenicity is 
unclear based on clinical and/or genetic data alone.
METHODS: The oligomerization, activity, phosphorylation, and interaction with 
FADD was assessed in HEK293T cells over-expressing LRRK2; while the induction of 
neuronal death was determined by quantifying apoptotic nuclei in primary neurons 
transiently expressing LRRK2.
RESULTS: One LRRK2 variant, A211V, exhibited a modest increase in kinase 
activity, whereas only the pathogenic mutants G2019S and I2020T displayed 
significantly altered auto-phosphorylation. We observed an induction of 
detergent-insoluble high molecular weight structures upon expression of 
pathogenic LRRK2 mutants, but not the other LRRK2 variants. In contrast, each of 
the variants tested induced apoptotic death of cultured neurons similar to 
pathogenic LRRK2 in a FADD-dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, despite differences in some properties of LRRK2 function 
such as kinase activity and its oligomerization, each of the LRRK2 variants 
examined induced neuronal death to a similar extent. Furthermore, our findings 
further strengthen the notion of a convergence on the extrinsic cell death 
pathway common to mutations in LRRK2 that are capable of inducing neuronal 
death.
