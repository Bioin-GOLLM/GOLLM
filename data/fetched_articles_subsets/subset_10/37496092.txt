BACKGROUND: Glutaric acidemia type 1 (GA1) is a rare autosomal recessive 
inherited metabolic disorder caused by variants in the gene encoding the enzyme 
glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH). The estimated prevalence of GA1 and the 
mutational spectrum of the GCDH gene vary widely according to race and region. 
The aim of this study was to assess the acylcarnitine profiles and genetic 
characteristics of patients with GA1 in Fujian Province, southeastern China.
RESULTS: From January 2014 to December 2022, a total of 1,151,069 newborns 
(631,016 males and 520,053 females) were screened using MS/MS in six newborn 
screening (NBS) centers in Fujian Province and recruited for this study. Through 
NBS, 18 newborns (13 females and 5 males) were diagnosed with GA1. Thus, the 
estimated incidence of GA1 was 1 in 63,948 newborns in Fujian province. In 
addition, 17 patients with GA1 were recruited after clinical diagnosis. All but 
one patient with GA1 had a remarkable increase in glutarylcarnitine (C5DC) 
concentrations. The results of urinary organic acid analyses in 33 patients 
showed that the concentration of glutaric acid (GA) increased in all patients. 
The levels of C5DC and GA in patients identified via NBS were higher than those 
in patients identified via clinical diagnosis (P < 0.05). A total of 71 variants 
of 70 alleles were detected in patients with GA1, with 19 different pathogenic 
variants identified. The three most prevalent variants represented 73.23% of the 
total and were c.1244-2 A > C, p.(?) (63.38%), c.1261G > A, p.Ala421Thr (5.63%), 
and c.406G > T, p.Gly136Cys (4.22%). The most abundant genotype observed was 
c.[1244-2 A > C]; [1244-2 A > C] (18/35, 52.43%) and its phenotype corresponded 
to high excretors (HE, GA > 100 mmol/mol Cr).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we investigated the biochemical and molecular 
features of 35 unrelated patients with GA1. C5DC concentrations in dried blood 
spots and urinary GA are effective indicators for a GA1 diagnosis. Our study 
also identified a GCDH variant spectrum in patients with GA1 from Fujian 
Province, southeastern China. Correlation analysis between genotypes and 
phenotypes provides preliminary and valuable information for genetic counseling 
and management.
