Terpenoid synthases construct the carbon skeletons of tens of thousands of 
natural products. To predict functions and specificity of triterpenoid 
synthases, a mechanism-based, multi-intermediate docking approach is proposed. 
In addition to enzyme function prediction, other potential applications of the 
current approach, such as enzyme mechanistic studies and enzyme redesign by 
mutagenesis, are discussed.
