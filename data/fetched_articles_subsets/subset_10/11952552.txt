Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease with variable 
expression. It is defined by a triad of symptoms: congenital ichthyosiform 
erythroderma, trichorrhexis invaginata and atopy. Recently, genetic linkage has 
been established to the SPINK5 gene locus on chromosome 5q32 encoding the serine 
protease inhibitor LEKTI. In this study, we present a recurrent homozygous 
mononucleotide deletion (153delT) resulting in a severe case of NS exhibiting 
exfoliative erythroderma with lethal outcome at the age of 4 months and its 
application in prenatal testing in a subsequent pregnancy of the mother.
