BACKGROUND: Lung cancer patients diagnosed following emergency admission often 
present with advanced disease and poor performance status, leading to suboptimal 
treatment options and outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and 
molecular characteristics, treatment initiation, and survival outcomes of these 
patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 124 patients diagnosed with lung 
cancer following emergency admission at a single institution. Clinical 
characteristics, results of molecular analyses for therapeutic purpose, systemic 
treatment initiation, and survival outcomes were assessed. Correlations between 
patients' characteristics and treatment initiation were analyzed.
RESULTS: Median age at admission was 73 years, and 79.0 % had at least one 
comorbidity. Most patients (87.1 %) were admitted due to cancer-related 
symptoms. Molecular analyses were performed in 89.5 % of advanced non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. In this subgroup, two-thirds (66.2 %) received 
first-line therapy. Median overall survival (OS) was 3.9 months for the entire 
cohort, and 2.9 months for patients with metastatic lung cancer. Among patients 
with advanced NSCLC, OS was significantly longer for those with actionable 
oncogenic drivers and those who received first-line therapy. Improvement of 
performance status during hospitalization resulted in increased probability of 
receiving first-line systemic therapy.
DISCUSSION: Patients diagnosed with lung cancer following emergency admission 
demonstrated poor survival outcomes. Treatment initiation, particularly for 
patients with actionable oncogenic drivers, was associated with longer OS. These 
findings highlight the need for proactive medical approaches, including 
improving access to molecular diagnostics and targeted treatments, to optimize 
outcomes in this patient population.
