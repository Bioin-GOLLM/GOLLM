BACKGROUND: Life at high altitude results in physiological and metabolic 
challenges that put strong evolutionary pressure on performance due to oxidative 
stress, UV radiation and other factors dependent on the natural history of the 
species. To look for genes involved in altitude adaptation in a large herbivore, 
this study explored genome differentiation between a feral population of Andean 
horses introduced by the Spanish in the 1500s to the high Andes and their 
Iberian breed relatives.
RESULTS: Using allelic genetic models and Fst analyses of ~50 K single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the horse genome, 131 candidate genes for 
altitude adaptation were revealed (Bonferoni of p ≤ 2 × 10(-7)). Significant 
signals included the EPAS1 in the hypoxia-induction-pathway (HIF) that was 
previously discovered in human studies (p = 9.27 × 10(-8)); validating the 
approach and emphasizing the importance of this gene to hypoxia adaptation. 
Strong signals in the cytochrome P450 3A gene family (p = 1.5 ×10(-8)) indicate 
that other factors, such as highly endemic vegetation in altitude environments 
are also important in adaptation. Signals in tenuerin 2 (TENM2, 
p = 7.9 × 10(-14)) along with several other genes in the nervous system (gene 
categories representation p = 5.1 × 10(-5)) indicate the nervous system is 
important in altitude adaptation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of a large introduced herbivore, it becomes apparent 
that some gene pathways, such as the HIF pathway are universally important for 
high altitude adaptation in mammals, but several others may be selected upon 
based on the natural history of a species and the unique ecology of the altitude 
environment.
