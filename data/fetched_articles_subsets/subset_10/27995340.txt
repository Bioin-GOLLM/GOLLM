AIMS: Genetic polymorphisms may contribute to platelet reactivity in diabetic 
patients; however, the information on their influence on long-term antiplatelet 
therapy is lacking. Our aim was to evaluate the role of previously described 
genetic variants and platelet reactivity on risk of all-cause mortality and 
cardiovascular events.
METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 303 Caucasian patients. Genome-wide 
genotyping was performed using Illumina Human Omni 2.5-Quad microarrays, and 
individual genotyping of selected SNPs was performed using a custom Sequenom 
iPLEX assay in conjunction with the Mass ARRAY platform. Platelet reactivity was 
measured with VerifyNow Aspirin Assay and PFA-100 Assay. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of 
genetic variants and platelets reactivity on risk of all-cause mortality and 
cardiovascular events.
RESULTS: Among the 237 patients included in the follow-up, death from any cause 
occurred in 34 (14.3%) patients and cardiovascular events occurred in 51 (21.5%) 
patients within a median observation time of 71 months (5.9 years). In 
univariate analyses, significant association in the presence of minor alleles in 
TXBA2R (rs1131882) with primary (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.15-5.60, p = 0.021) and 
secondary endpoint (HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.06-4.04, p = 0.034) was observed. In 
addition, multivariate analyses revealed the impact of this polymorphism on 
primary (HR 2.34, 95% CI 1.09-5.00, p = 0.029) and secondary endpoint (HR 1.89, 
95% CI 1.00-3.57, p = 0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: Results of the study demonstrate for the first time an association 
between genetic polymorphism within TXBA2R gene encoding platelet's surface 
receptor and long-term survival of diabetic patients treated with ASA.
