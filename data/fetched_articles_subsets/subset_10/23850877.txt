BACKGROUND & AIMS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the inosine 
triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) gene protect patients from ribavirin induced 
anemia. To investigate other possible protective cofactors, gender differences 
were analyzed in patients with HCV genotype 1.
METHODS: Hemoglobin levels at baseline (Hb0) and the decline after 4 weeks of 
treatment (HbΔ4) were analyzed in 308 chronic hepatitis C patients participating 
in 5 Austrian trials (n=308, age 43.9 ± 11.1, male:185, female:123, BMI 25.3 ± 
3.9, no cirrhosis: n=259, liver cirrhosis: n=49). All patients were treated with 
180 μg peginterferon-alpha 2a and ribavirin [1000-1200 mg/d; females: mean (95% 
CI) 15.8 mg/kg (15.4-16.2); males 14.3 (14.1-14.5); p<0.001]. The SNPs 
rs6051702, rs1127354, rs7270101 and IL28B rs12979860 were analyzed by the 
StepOnePlus Real time PCR System.
RESULTS: 188 were major alleles homozygotes; 95 (30.8%) carried the minor allele 
(C) of rs6051702, 47 (15.3%) of rs1127354 (A), and 69 (22.4%) of rs7270101 (C). 
The overall Hb0 was 14.8 g/dl (14.6-14.9) [mean (95%CI); females 13.7 
(13.5-13.9); males 15.5; 15.3-15.6; p<0.001]. The overall HbΔ4 was greater in 
major allele homozygotes [2.8 g/dl (2.6-3.0)] than in minor allele carriers [1.6 
(1.4-1.9); p<0.001]. Irrespective of the ITPA genotypes HbΔ4 was smaller in 
female [2.0 (1.7-2.2)] than in male patients [2.6 (2.4-2.8); p<0.001] and among 
females in premenopausal [1.5 (1.3-1.8)] than in postmenopausal patients [2.7 
(2.3-3.1); p<0.001].
CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of the protective effect of ITPA mutations, 
premenopausal females less likely develop ribavirin induced anemia.
