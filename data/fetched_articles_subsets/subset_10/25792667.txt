OBJECTIVES: Screening for MYO15A mutations was carried out using a large cohort 
to clarify the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with MYO15A 
(DFNB3) mutations in a hearing loss population.
METHODS: Genetic analysis of 63 previously reported deafness genes based on 
massively parallel DNA sequencing (MPS) in 1120 Japanese hearing loss patients 
from 53 otorhinolaryngology departments was performed. Detailed clinical 
features of the patients with MYO15A mutations were then collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: Eleven patients from 10 families were found to have compound 
heterozygosity for MYO15A. Audiograms showed profound or high frequency hearing 
loss, with some patients showing progressive hearing loss. Age at onset was 
found to vary from 0 to 14 years, which seemed to be associated with the 
mutation. Four children underwent bilateral cochlear implantation for congenital 
hearing loss, with all showing good results.
CONCLUSION: Mutations in the MYO15A gene are a notable cause of nonsyndromic 
hearing loss. MPS technology successfully detected mutations in relatively rare 
deafness genes such as MYO15A.
