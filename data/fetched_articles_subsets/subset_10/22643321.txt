BACKGROUND: First-degree relatives (FDRs) of women with PCOS are at increased 
risk for impaired insulin sensitivity and diabetes mellitus. Glucose tolerant 
FDR have evidence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia prior to emergence 
of frank PCOS.
AIM: To study insulin dynamics parameters in the early adolescent FDR of women 
with PCOS.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 18 adolescents whose mothers 
or sisters had been diagnosed with PCOS and 21 healthy, age-matched control 
adolescents without FDR. Subjects underwent anthropometric measurements, steroid 
profiling and frequently sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test (IVGTT), 
Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index, Glucose Disposal Index (GDI), Acute 
Insulin Response (AIR) and Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) 
were derived from IVGTT results.
RESULTS: FDRs showed significantly higher mean HOMA and lower GDI. There were no 
differences in mean age or BMI Z-score between the cohorts. No differences in 
sex steroids or AIR were identified between groups.
CONCLUSION: Female adolescent FDR of women with PCOS have higher HOMA index and 
lower QUICKI, reflecting altered insulin sensitivity and lower GDI reflecting 
poorer beta-cell function. The presence of multiple risk factors for type 2 
diabetes suggests that aggressive screening of the early adolescent FDR of women 
with PCOS is indicated.
