Increasing evidence suggests that synaptic dysfunction is a key 
pathophysiological hallmark in neurodegenerative disorders, including 
Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) in synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis, the impact of the BDNF 
Val66Met polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease-relevant endophenotypes - including 
episodic memory and hippocampal volume - and the technological progress in 
measuring synaptic changes in humans all pave the way for a 'synaptic repair' 
therapy for neurodegenerative diseases that targets pathophysiology rather than 
pathogenesis. This article reviews the key issues in translating BDNF biology 
into synaptic repair therapies.
