The continuous assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions is required for 
efficient cell spreading and migration. The G-protein-coupled receptor 
kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1) is a multidomain protein whose dynamic 
localization to sites of cytoskeletal remodeling is critically involved in the 
regulation of these processes. Here we provide evidence that the subcellular 
localization of GIT1 is regulated by protein kinase D3 (PKD3) through direct 
phosphorylation on serine 46. GIT1 phosphorylation on serine 46 was abrograted 
by PKD3 depletion, thereby identifying GIT1 as the first specific substrate for 
this kinase. A GIT1 S46D phosphomimetic mutant localized to motile, 
paxillin-positive cytoplasmic complexes, whereas the phosphorylation-deficient 
GIT1 S46A was enriched in focal adhesions. We propose that phosphorylation of 
GIT1 on serine 46 by PKD3 represents a molecular switch by which GIT1 
localization, paxillin trafficking, and cellular protrusive activity are 
regulated.
