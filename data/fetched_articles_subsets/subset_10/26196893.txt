Unfolded outer membrane beta-barrel proteins have been shown to self-associate 
in the absence of lipid bilayers. We previously investigated the formation of 
high molecular weight species by OmpA, with both the transmembrane domain alone 
and the full-length protein, and discovered that the oligomeric form contains 
non-native β-sheet structure. We have further probed the conformation of 
self-associated OmpA by monitoring binding to Thioflavin T, a dye that is known 
to bind the cross-β a structure inherent in amyloid fibrils, and by observing 
the species by electron microscopy. The significant increase in fluorescence 
indicative of Thioflavin T binding and the appearance of fibrillar species by 
electron microscopy verify that the protein forms amyloid-like fibril structures 
upon oligomerization. These results are also consistent with our previous 
kinetic analysis of OmpA self-association that revealed a nucleated growth 
polymerization mechanism, which is frequently observed in amyloid formation. The 
discovery of OmpA's ability to form amyloid-like fibrils provides a new model 
protein with which to study fibrillization, and implicates periplasmic chaperone 
proteins as capable of inhibiting fibril formation.
