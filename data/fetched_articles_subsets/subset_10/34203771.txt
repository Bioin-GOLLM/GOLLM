Melanoma develops from malignant transformations of the pigment-producing 
melanocytes. If located in the basal layer of the skin epidermis, melanoma is 
referred to as cutaneous, which is more frequent. However, as melanocytes are be 
found in the eyes, ears, gastrointestinal tract, genitalia, urinary system, and 
meninges, cases of mucosal melanoma or other types (e.g., ocular) may occur. The 
incidence and morbidity of cutaneous melanoma (cM) are constantly increasing 
worldwide. Australia and New Zealand are world leaders in this regard with a 
morbidity rate of 54/100,000 and a mortality rate of 5.6/100,000 for 2015. The 
aim of this review is to consolidate and present the data related to the 
aetiology and pathogenesis of cutaneous melanoma, thus rendering them easier to 
understand. In this article we will discuss these problems and the possible 
impacts on treatment for this disease.
