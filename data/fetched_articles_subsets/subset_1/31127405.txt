Over the last 5Â years deep learning has progressed tremendously in both image 
recognition and natural language processing. Now it is increasingly applied to 
other data rich fields. In drug discovery, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have 
been shown to be an effective method to generate novel chemical structures in 
the form of SMILES. However, ligands generated by current methods have so far 
provided relatively low diversity and do not fully cover the whole chemical 
space occupied by known ligands. Here, we propose a new method (DrugEx) to 
discover de novo drug-like molecules. DrugEx is an RNN model (generator) trained 
through reinforcement learning which was integrated with a special exploration 
strategy. As a case study we applied our method to design ligands against the 
adenosine A2A receptor. From ChEMBL data, a machine learning model (predictor) 
was created to predict whether generated molecules are active or not. Based on 
this predictor as the reward function, the generator was trained by 
reinforcement learning without any further data. We then compared the 
performance of our method with two previously published methods, REINVENT and 
ORGANIC. We found that candidate molecules our model designed, and predicted to 
be active, had a larger chemical diversity and better covered the chemical space 
of known ligands compared to the state-of-the-art.
