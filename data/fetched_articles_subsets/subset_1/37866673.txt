BACKGROUND: Historically, due to the lack of distinct clinical symptoms, Alport 
syndrome, a hereditary kidney disease prevalent in children and a leading cause 
of kidney failure, has often been misdiagnosed as other kidney conditions.
CASE DESCRIPTION: This article presents a comprehensive review and analysis of 
clinical data concerning a child diagnosed with Alport syndrome, where nephrotic 
syndrome served as the primary manifestation. The male child in this case 
exhibited symptoms starting at the age of 6, initially diagnosed as nephrotic 
syndrome. Consequently, oral steroid medication was administered, proving 
ineffective. Due to persistent proteinuria and microscopic hematuria, a renal 
biopsy was performed. Immunofluorescence staining revealed no abnormal 
expression of the α3, α4, and α5 chains of type IV collagen. Notably, electron 
microscopy revealed the basement membrane to be partially torn and arachnoid. 
Genetic testing indicated a hemizygous COL4A5 acceptor-splice-site mutation 
c.4707-1(IVS50)G > A, inherited from his mother.
CONCLUSION: This specific mutated locus, being the first of its kind reported, 
adds valuable information to the existing gene mutation spectrum of Alport 
syndrome. Consequently, it emphasizes the importance for clinicians to deepen 
their understanding of rare kidney diseases, contributing to enhanced diagnostic 
accuracy and improved patient care.
