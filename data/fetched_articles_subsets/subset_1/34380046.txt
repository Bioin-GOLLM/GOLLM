Animal bodies are composed of cell types with unique expression programs that 
implement their distinct locations, shapes, structures, and functions. Based on 
these properties, cell types assemble into specific tissues and organs. To 
systematically explore the link between cell-type-specific gene expression and 
morphology, we registered an expression atlas to a whole-body electron 
microscopy volume of the nereid Platynereis dumerilii. Automated segmentation of 
cells and nuclei identifies major cell classes and establishes a link between 
gene activation, chromatin topography, and nuclear size. Clustering of segmented 
cells according to gene expression reveals spatially coherent tissues. In the 
brain, genetically defined groups of neurons match ganglionic nuclei with 
coherent projections. Besides interneurons, we uncover sensory-neurosecretory 
cells in the nereid mushroom bodies, which thus qualify as sensory organs. They 
furthermore resemble the vertebrate telencephalon by molecular anatomy. We 
provide an integrated browser as a Fiji plugin for remote exploration of all 
available multimodal datasets.
