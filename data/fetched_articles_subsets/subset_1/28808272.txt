The human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme is part of phase-I metabolism and 
metabolizes at least 20% of all clinically relevant drugs. Therefore, it is an 
important target for drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. High-throughput 
screening (HTS) assays are commonly used tools to examine DDI, but show certain 
drawbacks with regard to their applicability to natural products. We propose an 
in silico - in vitro workflow for the reliable identification of natural 
products with CYP2D6 inhibitory potential. In order to identify candidates from 
natural product-based databases that share similar structural features with 
established inhibitors, a pharmacophore model was applied. The virtual hits were 
tested for the inhibition of recombinant human CYP2D6 in a bioluminescence-based 
assay. By controlling for unspecific interferences of the test compounds with 
the detection reaction, the number of false positives were reduced. The success 
rate of the reported workflow was 76%, as most of the candidates identified in 
the in silico approach were able to inhibit CYP2D6 activity. In summary, the 
workflow presented here is a suitable and cost-efficient strategy for the 
discovery of new CYP2D6 inhibitors with natural product libraries.
