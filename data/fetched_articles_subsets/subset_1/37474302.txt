Leukodystrophies are a group of genetic diseases with diverse clinical features 
and prominent involvement of the central nervous system white matter. We 
describe a 27-year-old man who presented with a progressive neurological 
disease, and striking involvement of the brainstem and symmetrical white matter 
lesions on MR scanning. Having excluded several other causes of leukodystrophy, 
we confirmed Alexander disease when a genetic panel showed a probable pathogenic 
variant in GFAP: p.Leu359Pro. Clinicians should suspect Alexander disease in 
people with a progressive neurological motor decline who has pyramidal and 
bulbar signs and compatible neuroimaging.
