Integrins undergo global conformational changes that specify their activation 
state. Current models portray the inactive receptor in a bent conformation that 
upon activation converts to a fully extended form in which the integrin subunit 
leg regions are separated to enable ligand binding and subsequent signaling. To 
test the applicability of this model in adherent cells, we used a fluorescent 
resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach, in combination with engineered 
integrin mutants and monoclonal antibody reporters, to image integrin 
alpha5beta1 conformation. We find that restricting leg separation causes the 
integrin to adopt a bent conformation that is unable to respond to agonists and 
mediate cell spreading. By measuring FRET between labeled alpha5beta1 and the 
cell membrane, we find extended receptors are enriched in focal adhesions 
compared with adjacent regions of the plasma membrane. These results demonstrate 
definitely that major quaternary rearrangements of beta1-integrin subunits occur 
in adherent cells and that conversion from a bent to extended form takes place 
at focal adhesions.
