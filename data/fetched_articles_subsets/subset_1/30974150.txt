Deflecting biomineralized crystals attached to vestibular hair cells are 
necessary for maintaining balance. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are useful organisms 
to study these biomineralized crystals called otoliths, as many required genes 
are homologous to human otoconial development. We sought to identify and 
characterize the causative gene in a trio of homozygous recessive mutants, no 
content (nco) and corkscrew (csr), and vanished (vns), which fail to develop 
otoliths during early ear development. We show that nco, csr, and vns have 
potentially deleterious mutations in polyketide synthase (pks1), a multi-modular 
protein that has been previously implicated in biomineralization events in 
chordates and echinoderms. We found that Otoconin-90 (Oc90) expression within 
the otocyst is diffuse in nco and csr; therefore, it is not sufficient for 
otolith biomineralization in zebrafish. Similarly, normal localization of 
Otogelin, a protein required for otolith tethering in the otolithic membrane, is 
not sufficient for Oc90 attachment. Furthermore, eNOS signaling and Endothelin-1 
signaling were the most up- and down-regulated pathways during otolith agenesis 
in nco, respectively. Our results demonstrate distinct processes for otolith 
nucleation and biomineralization in vertebrates and will be a starting point for 
models that are independent of Oc90-mediated seeding. This study will serve as a 
basis for investigating the role of eNOS signaling and Endothelin-1 signaling 
during otolith formation.
