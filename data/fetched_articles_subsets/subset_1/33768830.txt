GABA transaminase deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis 
of early onset epileptic encephalopathies. This case was diagnosed post-mortem, 
but increased vigilance to this will allow for earlier diagnoses in other 
infants and families. This is a case study which involved diagnosis of a rare 
neurometabolic disorder in one of the babies in the family and eventual genetic 
counselling of the family. The family has been offered pre-implantation genetic 
diagnosis for future pregnancies. This case reporting has been approved by the 
hospital research and ethical committee.
