BACKGROUND: Olsenella uli is anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria, commonly 
found in oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract, which has not been reported to 
be associated with lower respiratory tract infection. Herein, we report the 
first case of Olsenella uli infection in the lung.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old male farmer with no history of other 
respiratory tract diseases developed a cough with bloody sputum three times a 
day without obvious causes or other concomitant symptoms. After a period of 
treatment with empirical antibiotic, his condition did not improve. The computed 
tomography (CT) and lung biopsy results indicated bilateral pneumonia, and 
Olsenella uli was identified by micromorphology, sequence analysis and mass 
spectrometry analysis recovered from sputum. Ceftazidime, a third generation 
cephalosporin was used for the treatment, and the patient recovered after 10 
days.
CONCLUSIONS: Our report suggests a causative role of gingival bacteria in the 
pathogenesis of pneumonia, thus early diagnosis and prompt antibiotic therapy 
may play a role in the treatment of Olsenella uli induced pneumonia.
