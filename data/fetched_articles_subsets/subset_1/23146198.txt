BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorder are 
over represented in combat veterans. Veterans with both disorders have an 
increased risk of suicide. The nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein (NOS1AP) 
gene, which modulates stress-evoked N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) activity, was 
investigated in combat veterans.
METHODS: A comprehensive genetic analysis of NOS1AP and its association with 
PTSD was investigated in Vietnam combat veterans with PTSD (n=121) and a group 
of healthy control individuals (n=237). PTSD patients were assessed for symptom 
severity and level of depression using the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related 
PTSD and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI).
RESULTS: The G allele of NOS1AP SNP rs386231 was significantly associated with 
PTSD (p=0.002). Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in BDI-II 
and Mississippi scores between genotypes for rs386231 with the GG genotype 
associated with increased severity of depression (p=0.002 F=6.839) and higher 
Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD scores (p=0.033). Haplotype analysis 
revealed that the C/G haplotype (rs451275/rs386231) was significantly associated 
with PTSD (p=0.001).
LIMITATIONS: The sample sizes in our study were not sufficient to detect SNP 
associations with very small effects. In addition the study was limited by its 
cross sectional design.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting that a variant of the NOS1AP gene 
is associated with PTSD. Our data also suggest that a genetic variant in NOS1AP 
may increase the susceptibility to severe depression in patients with PTSD and 
increased risk for suicide.
