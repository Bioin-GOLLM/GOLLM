BACKGROUND: Impaired B-cell receptor (BCR) function has been associated with the 
progress of several B-cell malignancies. The spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) 
represents a potential therapeutic target in a subset of B-cell neoplasias. In 
precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the pathogenic role and 
therapeutic potential of SYK is still controversially discussed. We evaluate the 
application of the SYK inhibitor entospletinib (Ento) in pre- and pro-B-ALL cell 
lines, characterizing the biologic and molecular effects.
METHODS: SYK expression was characterized in pre-B-ALL (NALM-6) and pro-B-ALL 
cell lines (SEM and RS4;11). The cell lines were exposed to different Ento 
concentrations and the cell biological response analyzed by proliferation, 
metabolic activity, apoptosis induction, cell-cycle distribution and morphology. 
BCR pathway gene expression and protein modulations were further characterized.
RESULTS: Ento significantly induced anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects 
in NALM-6 and SEM, while barely affecting RS4;11. Targeted RNAseq revealed 
pronounced gene expression modulation only in NALM-6, while Western Blot 
analyses demonstrated that vital downstream effector proteins, such as pAKT, 
pERK, pGSK3Î², p53 and BCL-6, were affected by Ento exposure in the 
inhibitor-sensitive cell lines.
CONCLUSION: Different acting modes of Ento, independent of pre-BCR dependency, 
were characterized, unexpected in SEM. Accordingly, SYK classifies as a 
potential target structure in a subset of pro-B-ALLs.
