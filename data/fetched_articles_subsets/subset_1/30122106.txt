The human brain weighs approximately 2% of the body; however, it consumes about 
20% of a person's total energy intake. Cellular bioenergetics in the central 
nervous system involves a delicate balance between biochemical processes engaged 
in energy conversion and those responsible for respiration. Neurons have high 
energy demands, which rely on metabolic coupling with glia, such as with 
oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. It has been well established that astrocytes 
recycle and transport glutamine to neurons to make the essential 
neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, as well as shuttle lactate to support 
energy synthesis in neurons. However, the metabolic role of oligodendrocytes in 
the central nervous system is less clear. In this review, we discuss the 
energetic demands of oligodendrocytes in their survival and maturation, the 
impact of altered oligodendrocyte energetics on disease pathology, and the role 
of energetic metabolites, taurine, creatine, N-acetylaspartate, and biotin, in 
regulating oligodendrocyte function.
