Hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA) is an autosomal dominant 
disorder leading to massive brain hemorrhage and death in young adults (Jensson 
et al., 1987). A variant of a potent inhibitor of cysteine proteinases, cystatin 
C (Barrett et al., 1984), is deposited as amyloid fibrils in the cerebral 
arteries of the patients (Ghiso et al., 1986). We have used the full length 
cystatin C cDNA probe (Abrahamson et al., 1987) to demonstrate a mutation in the 
codon for leucine at position 68, which abolishes an Alu I restriction site in 
cystatin C gene of the HCCAA patients. The Alu I marker has been used to show 
that this mutation is transmitted only in the affected members in all eight 
families investigated, proving that the mutated cystatin C gene causes HCCAA. 
This DNA marker will be useful for the diagnosis of HCCAA in patients, 
asymptomatic affected individuals and also for pre-natal diagnosis. HCCAA is the 
first human disorder known to be caused by an abnormal gene for a cysteine 
proteinase inhibitor.
