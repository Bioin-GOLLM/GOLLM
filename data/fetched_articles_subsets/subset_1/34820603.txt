The kidneys balance many byproducts of the metabolism of dietary components. 
Previous studies examining dietary effects on kidney health are generally of 
short duration and manipulate a single macronutrient. Here, kidney function and 
structure were examined in C57BL/6J mice randomized to consume one of a spectrum 
of macronutrient combinations (protein [5%-60%], carbohydrate [20%-75%], and fat 
[20%-75%]) from weaning to late-middle age (15 months). Individual and 
interactive impacts of macronutrients on kidney health were modeled. Dietary 
protein had the greatest influence on kidney function, where chronic low protein 
intake decreased glomerular filtration rates and kidney mass, whereas it 
increased kidney immune infiltration and structural injury. Kidney outcomes did 
not align with cardiometabolic risk factors including glucose intolerance, 
overweight/obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension in mice with chronic low 
protein consumption. This study highlights that protein intake over a lifespan 
is an important determinant of kidney function independent of cardiometabolic 
changes.
