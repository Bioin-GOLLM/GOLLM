Members of a domestic cat colony with chylomicronemia share many phenotypic 
features with human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency. Biochemical analysis 
reveals that these cats do have defective LPL catalytic activity and have a 
clinical phenotype very similar to human LPL deficiency. To determine the 
molecular basis underlying this biochemical phenotype, we have cloned the normal 
and affected cat LPL cDNAs and shown that the affected cat has a nucleotide 
change resulting in a substitution of arginine for glycine at residue 412 in 
exon 8. In vitro mutagenesis and expression studies, in addition to segregation 
analysis, have shown that this DNA change is the cause of LPL deficiency in this 
cat colony. Reduced body mass, growth rates, and increased stillbirth rates are 
observed in cats homozygous for this mutation. These findings show that this LPL 
deficient cat can serve as an animal model of human LPL deficiency and will be 
useful for in vivo investigation of the relationship between triglyceride rich 
lipoproteins and atherogenic risk and for the assessment of new approaches for 
treatment of LPL deficiency, including gene therapy.
