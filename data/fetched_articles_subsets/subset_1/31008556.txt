OBJECTIVE: Individuals with deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2), a 
recently recognized autosomal recessive disease, present with various systemic 
vascular and inflammatory manifestations, often with young age at disease onset 
or with early onset of recurrent strokes. Their clinical features and histologic 
findings overlap with those of childhood-onset polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a 
primary "idiopathic" systemic vasculitis. Despite similar clinical presentation, 
individuals with DADA2 may respond better to biologic therapy than to 
traditional immunosuppression. The aim of this study was to screen an 
international registry of children with systemic primary vasculitis for variants 
in ADA2.
METHODS: The coding exons of ADA2 were sequenced in 60 children and adolescents 
with a diagnosis of PAN, cutaneous PAN, or unclassifiable vasculitis (UCV), any 
chronic vasculitis with onset at age 5 years or younger, or history of stroke. 
The functional consequences of the identified variants were assessed by ADA2 
enzyme assay and immunoblotting.
RESULTS: Nine children with DADA2 (5 with PAN, 3 with UCV, and 1 with 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis) were identified. 
Among them, 1 patient had no rare variants in the coding region of ADA2 and 8 
had biallelic, rare variants (minor allele frequency <0.01) with a known 
association with DADA2 (p.Gly47Arg and p.Gly47Ala) or a novel association 
(p.Arg9Trp, p.Leu351Gln, and p.Ala357Thr). The clinical phenotype varied widely.
CONCLUSION: These findings support previous observations indicating that DADA2 
has extensive genotypic and phenotypic variability. Thus, screening ADA2 among 
children with vasculitic rash, UCV, PAN, or unexplained, early-onset central 
nervous system disease with systemic inflammation may enable an earlier 
diagnosis of DADA2.
