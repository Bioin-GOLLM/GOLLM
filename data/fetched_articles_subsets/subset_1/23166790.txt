Angiogenesis inhibition is an important therapeutic strategy for advanced stage 
prostate cancer. Previous work from our laboratory showed that sustained 
stimulation of Rap1 by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP (8CPT) via activation of Epac, a Rap1 
GEF, or by expression of a constitutively active Rap1 mutant (cRap1) suppresses 
endothelial cell chemotaxis and subsequent angiogenesis. When we tested this 
model in the context of a prostate tumor xenograft, we found that 8CPT had no 
significant effect on prostate tumor growth alone. However, in cells harboring 
cRap1, 8CPT dramatically inhibited not only prostate tumor growth but also VEGF 
expression and angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment. Subsequent 
analysis of the mechanism revealed that, in prostate tumor epithelial cells, 
8CPT acted via stimulation of PKA rather than Epac/Rap1. PKA antagonizes Rap1 
and hypoxic induction of 1Î± protein expression, VEGF production and, ultimately, 
angiogenesis. Together these findings provide evidence for a novel interplay 
between Rap1, Epac, and PKA that regulates tumor-stromal induction of 
angiogenesis.
