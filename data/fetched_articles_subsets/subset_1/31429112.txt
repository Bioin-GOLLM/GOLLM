OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyse the molecular backgrounds of the family in which 
an eight-day-old baby was confirmed to have hemolytic disease of the newborn 
(HDN) and phenotype observed for the baby did not conform to the expected 
phenotype.
BACKGROUND: The silent RHCE allele is rare in the Rh system.
METHODS: To determine the antibody specificity, her family members' blood 
samples were collected and tested using routine serological methods. The Rh 
C + c-e + E- phenotype observed for the baby did not conform to the expected 
phenotype based on the maternal RhC-c + E + e- phenotype. The RH genes of the 
family members were further analysed by sequencing.
RESULTS: The Rh phenotypes of the baby, her brother, her mother and father were 
CCDee, CcDEe, ccDEE and CCDee, respectively. IgG anti-e was confirmed to cause 
the HDN in the case. A heterozygous silent RHCE * 03(c.1059G > A) mutation in 
exon 7 was found in the baby and her mother, which is a novel nonsense allele 
caused by a premature termination codon (Trp353stop).
CONCLUSION: The silent RHCE * 03(c.1059G > A) variant was observed in a 
heterozygous state in mother and baby. We predict that, had this occurred in the 
homozygous state, it would give rise to the rare D-- phenotype. To enhance the 
safety of transfusion, considerable attention should be paid to the RHCE gene in 
the Chinese population.
