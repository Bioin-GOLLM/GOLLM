Sirtuins are NAD-dependent protein deacetylases that connect metabolism and 
aging. In mammals, there are seven sirtuins (SIRT1-7), three of which are 
associated with mitochondria. Here, we show that SIRT5 localizes in the 
mitochondrial matrix and interacts with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1), 
an enzyme, catalyzing the initial step of the urea cycle for ammonia 
detoxification and disposal. SIRT5 deacetylates CPS1 and upregulates its 
activity. During fasting, NAD in liver mitochondria increases, thereby 
triggering SIRT5 deacetylation of CPS1 and adaptation to the increase in amino 
acid catabolism. Indeed, SIRT5 KO mice fail to upregulate CPS1 activity and show 
elevated blood ammonia during fasting. Similar effects occur during long-term 
calorie restriction or a high protein diet. These findings demonstrate SIRT5 
plays a pivotal role in ammonia detoxification and disposal by activating CPS1.
