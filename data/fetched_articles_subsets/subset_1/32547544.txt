Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) characterized by persistent and 
recurrent Candida infection of the skin, nails, and the mucosa membranes has 
been proposed as the major infectious phenotype in patients with 
gain-of-function mutation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 
(STAT1) 1. However, viral infections caused mostly by herpesviruses, and a broad 
range of autoimmune disorders may also be part of the clinical phenotype. We 
report here on a 31 years old female patient suffering from severe mucosal 
aphthous mucositis and ulcers and recurrent herpes simplex for decades. We found 
a previously unknown heterozygous sequence variant in STAT1 (c.1219C>G; L407V) 
affecting the DNA-binding domain of the protein in the patient and her 4 years 
old daughter. We found this mutation gain-of-function (GOF) by using immunoblot 
and luciferase assays. We detected low proportion of IL-17A-producing CD4+ T 
cell lymphocytes by using intracellular staining and flow cytometry. 
Candida-induced secretion of IL-17A and IL-22 by mononuclear cells from the 
patient was markedly decreased compared to controls. These data suggest that the 
novel mutant allele may result in impaired differentiation of CD4+ T cells to 
CD4+/IL-17+ cells. The clinical phenotype of the disease in this patient was 
unique as it was dominated primarily by severe aphthous stomatitis and 
ulcerative esophagitis and only partly by typical CMC resulting in diagnostic 
delay. We suggest that patients with severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis and 
esophagitis should be evaluated for STAT1 GOF mutation. Based on the broad 
clinical spectrum of the disease, we also suggest that CMC and CMC disease may 
not be an appropriate term to define clinically STAT1 GOF mutation.
