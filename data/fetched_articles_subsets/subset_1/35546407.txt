BACKGROUND: Finding the key amino acid sites that could affect viral 
biological properties or protein functions has always been a topic of 
substantial interest in virology. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the 
principal proteins of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 
(PRRSV) and plays a vital role in the virus life cycle. The N protein has only 
123 or 128 amino acids, some of key amino acid sites which could affect the 
protein functions or impair the viral biological characteristics have been 
identified. In this research, our objective was to find out whether there are 
other novel amino acid sites of the N protein can affect N protein functions or 
PRRSV-2 replication.
RESULTS: In this study, we found mutated the serine78 and serine 99of the 
nucleocapsid (N) protein can reduce the N-induced expression of IL-10 mRNA; 
Then, by using reverse genetics system, we constructed and rescued the mutant 
viruses, namely, A78 and A99.The IFA result proved that the mutations did not 
affect the rescue of the PRRSV-2. However, the results of the multistep growth 
kinetics and qPCR assays indicated that, compared with the viral replication 
ability, the titres and gRNA levels of A78 were significantly decreased compared 
with the wild-type. Further study showed that a single amino acid change from 
serine to alanine at position 78 of the N protein could abrogates the level of 
viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs. It means the mutation could significant 
decrease the viral replication efficiency in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the serine78 of N protein is a key site 
which could affect the N protein function and PRRSV replication ability.
