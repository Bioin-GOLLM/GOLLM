PURPOSE: To describe patients with late-onset pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) 
associated with a likely hypomorphic ABCC6 variant.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series.
METHODS: Clinical evaluation, multimodal retinal imaging, genetic testing, and 
molecular modeling.
RESULTS: Three patients, in whom vision symptoms first arose at 80 years of age 
or later, showed age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-like fundus changes. 
However, features characteristic of PXE, including discrete angioid streaks and 
reduced fluorescence on late-phase indocyanine green angiography, prompted 
genetic testing which revealed the c.1171A>G variant in combination with a large 
deletion in the ABCC6 gene in each case. None of the patients had obvious skin 
changes or cardiovascular disease atypical for their age. Comparative molecular 
modeling supported the hypothesis that the c.1171A>GABCC6 variant acted as a 
hypomorphic variant.
CONCLUSIONS: Late-onset PXE extends the spectrum of ectopic calcification 
disorders caused by mutations in ABCC6 and may clinically be limited to the eye, 
mimicking AMD. Patients may be identified based on specific ocular changes, 
whereas skin and cardiovascular changes may remain ambiguous. The study provides 
evidence for a role for hypomorphic ABCC6 variants in the pathogenesis of PXE.
