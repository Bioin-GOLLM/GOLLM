At present, cancer is the largest culprit that endangers human health. The 
current treatment options for cancer mainly include surgical resection, adjuvant 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but their therapeutic effects and long-term 
prognosis are unsatisfactory. Immunotherapy is an emerging therapy that has 
completely transformed the therapeutic landscape of advanced cancers, and has 
tried to occupy a place in the neoadjuvant therapy of resectable tumors. 
However, not all patients respond to immunotherapy due to the immunological and 
molecular features of the tumors. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) provides a 
new perspective for cancer treatment and is considered to have the potential as 
promising anti-tumor drugs considering its immunoregulatory properties. This 
review concludes commonly used TCM monomers and compounds from the perspective 
of immune regulatory pathways, aiming to clearly introduce the basic mechanisms 
of TCM in boosting cancer immunotherapy and mechanisms of several common TCM. In 
addition, we also summarized closed and ongoing trials and presented prospects 
for future development. Due to the significant role of immunotherapy in the 
treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TCM combined with immunotherapy 
should be emphasized in NSCLC.
