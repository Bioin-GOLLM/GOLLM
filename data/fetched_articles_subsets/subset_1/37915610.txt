Decidualization of endometrial stromal cells is a hallmark of endometrial 
receptivity for embryo implantation, and dysfunctional decidualization is 
associated with pregnancy failure. Protein glycosylation is an important 
posttranslational modification that affects the structure and function of 
glycoproteins. Our results showed that high-mannose epitopes were elevated in 
the decidual tissues of miscarriage patients compared with early pregnant women 
by Lectin microarray. Furthermore, the level of mannosyl-oligosaccharide α-1,2 
mannosidase IA (MAN1A1), a key enzyme for high-mannose glycan biosynthesis, was 
decreased in the decidual tissues of miscarriage patients. Screening of lncRNAs 
showed that lncNEAT1 level was increased in the serum and decidua of miscarriage 
patients, and negatively correlated with MAN1A1 expression. The results also 
revealed that specific binding of lncNEAT1 with nucleophosmin (NPM1)-SP1 
transcription complex inhibited MAN1A1 expression and hampered endometrial 
decidualization and embryo implantation potential. The study suggests the new 
insights into the function of high-mannose glycans/MAN1A1 modification during 
endometrial decidualization.
