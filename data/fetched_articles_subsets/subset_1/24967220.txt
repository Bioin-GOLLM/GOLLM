BACKGROUND: Although much is known about the management of peripheral arterial 
disease among adults in the general population, the management of this disease 
among those with diabetes, and the effects of diabetic-induced peripheral 
arterial disease on objectively-measured physical activity, is unclear. Here, we 
examined the association between accelerometer-assessed physical activity and 
peripheral arterial disease among a national sample of U.S. adults with 
diabetes.
METHODS: Data from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey were used. Physical activity was measured using an accelerometer in 254 
adults with diabetes. Peripheral arterial disease was assessed via ankle 
brachial index. Negative binomial regression analysis was used to examine the 
association between physical activity and peripheral arterial disease.
RESULTS: Results were adjusted for age, gender, race-ethnicity, comorbidity 
index, smoking, HgbA1C, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, glomerular filtration 
rate, microalbuminuria, peripheral neuropathy, physical functioning, and 
medication use. After adjustments, participants with peripheral arterial disease 
engaged in 23% less physical activity (RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.96) than those 
without peripheral arterial disease.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate an inverse association between 
accelerometer-assessed physical activity and peripheral arterial disease in a 
national sample of U.S adults with diabetes.
