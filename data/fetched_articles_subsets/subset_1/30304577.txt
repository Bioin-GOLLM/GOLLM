Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a frequently occurring disease affecting 
women under 40 years old. Recently, we have analyzed unrelated POI women via 
whole exome sequencing (WES) and identified NOTCH2 mutations underlying possible 
functional effects. The present study involved reanalyzing of WES assays. We 
used in the KGN granulosa-like cell model, a synthetic gene reporter construct 
driving luciferase gene expression to assess the functional effects of five 
NOTCH2 mutations identified in POI patients. We found that NOTCH2-p.Ser1804Leu, 
p.Ala2316Val, and p.Pro2359Ala mutations had a functional impact on the 
protein's transcriptional activity. The results have demonstrated for the first 
time that NOTCH2 mutations contribute to POI etiology. We therefore recommend 
sequencing NOTCH2's open reading frame in large panels of POI patients to 
establish an accurate genotype-phenotype correlation. We cannot rule out the 
fact that patients affected by Alagille syndrome carrying NOTCH2 mutations may 
suffer ovarian dysfunction.
