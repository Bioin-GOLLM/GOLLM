Goldenhar syndrome or oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) is a complex 
developmental disorder characterized by asymmetric ear anomalies, hemifacial 
microsomia, ocular and vertebral defects. We aimed at identifying and 
characterizing a new gene associated with OAVS. Two affected brothers with OAVS 
were analyzed by exome sequencing that revealed a missense variant 
(p.(Asn358Ser)) in the EYA3 gene. EYA3 screening was then performed in 122 OAVS 
patients that identified the same variant in one individual from an unrelated 
family. Segregation assessment in both families showed incomplete penetrance and 
variable expressivity. We investigated this variant in cellular models to 
determine its pathogenicity and demonstrated an increased half-life of the 
mutated protein without impact on its ability to dephosphorylate H2AFX following 
DNA repair pathway induction. Proteomics performed on this cellular model 
revealed four significantly predicted upstream regulators which are PPARGC1B, 
YAP1, NFE2L2 and MYC. Moreover, eya3 knocked-down zebrafish embryos developed 
specific craniofacial abnormalities corroborating previous animal models and 
supporting its involvement in the OAVS. Additionally, EYA3 gene expression was 
deregulated in vitro by retinoic acid exposure. EYA3 is the second recurrent 
gene identified to be associated with OAVS. Moreover, based on protein 
interactions and related diseases, we suggest the DNA repair as a key molecular 
pathway involved in craniofacial development.
