PURPOSE: The Aurora kinase family plays pivotal roles in mitotic integrity and 
cell cycle. We sought to determine the effects of inhibiting Aurora kinase on 
ovarian cancer growth in an orthotopic mouse model using a small molecule 
pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor, MK-0457.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined cell cycle regulatory effects and ascertained 
the therapeutic efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibition both alone and combined 
with docetaxel using both in vitro and in vivo ovarian cancer models.
RESULTS: In vitro cytotoxicity assays with HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 cells revealed 
>10-fold greater docetaxel cytotoxicity in combination with MK-0457. After in 
vivo dose kinetics were determined using phospho-histone H3 status, therapy 
experiments with the chemosensitive HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 as well as the 
chemoresistant HeyA8-MDR and A2780-CP20 models showed that Aurora kinase 
inhibition alone significantly reduced tumor burden compared with controls (P 
values<0.01). Combination treatment with docetaxel resulted in significantly 
improved reduction in tumor growth beyond that afforded by docetaxel alone (P 
<or= 0.03). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry revealed 
that MK-0457 alone and in combination with docetaxel significantly reduced 
cellular proliferation (P values<0.001). Compared with controls, treatment with 
MK-0457 alone and in combination with docetaxel also significantly increased 
tumor cell apoptosis by approximately 3-fold (P<0.01). Remarkably, compared with 
docetaxel monotherapy, MK-0457 combined with docetaxel resulted in significantly 
increased tumor cell apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Aurora kinase inhibition significantly reduces tumor burden and 
cell proliferation and increases tumor cell apoptosis in this preclinical 
orthotopic model of ovarian cancer. The role of Aurora kinase inhibition in 
ovarian cancer merits further investigation in clinical trials.
