Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder 
that affects about 1% of the population worldwide. Despite significant advances 
in the identification of genetic mutations and signaling pathways that are 
associated with the disease, the precise mechanisms implicated in the 
pathophysiology of the disease are not well understood. More importantly, 
treatments that are effective in reversing the progression of the disease is 
essentially lacking. Further investigation into the pathogenic mechanisms of PD 
thus presents a pressing concern for neuroscientists. Recently, deregulation of 
the autophagic pathway is observed in the brains of PD patients and in models of 
PD. In this review we summarize current literature on the emerging involvement 
of autophagy in PD, and the implication for future development of treatment 
against the disorder.
