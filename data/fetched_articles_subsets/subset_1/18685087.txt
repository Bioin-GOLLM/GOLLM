The ability to selectively induce a strong immune response against 
self-proteins, or increase the immunogenicity of specific epitopes in foreign 
antigens, would have a significant impact on the production of vaccines for 
cancer, protein-misfolding diseases, and infectious diseases. Here, we show that 
site-specific incorporation of an immunogenic unnatural amino acid into a 
protein of interest produces high-titer antibodies that cross-react with WT 
protein. Specifically, mutation of a single tyrosine residue (Tyr(86)) of murine 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (mTNF-alpha) to p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO(2)Phe) 
induced a high-titer antibody response in mice, whereas no significant antibody 
response was observed for a Tyr(86) --> Phe mutant. The antibodies generated 
against the pNO(2)Phe are highly cross-reactive with native mTNF-alpha and 
protect mice against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced death. This approach may 
provide a general method for inducing an antibody response to specific epitopes 
of self- and foreign antigens that lead to a neutralizing immune response.
