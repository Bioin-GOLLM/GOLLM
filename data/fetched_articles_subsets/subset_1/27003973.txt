BACKGROUND: Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death in the world. Hence, we 
investigated the factors affecting disease control among diabetic patients 
referred to Imam Reza Hospital (central hospital in the Northwest of Iran).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eight diabetic patients were evaluated. 
Patient's main medications including insulin, metformin, glibenclamide, and 
glytazon were registered and the levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), glucose 2 
h postprandial (pp), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were measured. All risk factors 
were evaluated by using a questionnaire completed by the patients.
RESULTS: The average of HbA1c, FBS, and glucose 2 h pp was 7.33%, 159 mg/dl, and 
233.03 mg/dl, respectively. In patients whose disease was controlled, the family 
history of the disease, the type of medication, and the visits to family 
physician had a significant association with disease control. The average mean 
of HbA1c among patients with controlled and uncontrolled disease was 5.93% and 
8.63 % respectively.
CONCLUSION: Less stress, education, and weekly exercise had an essential role in 
controlling the disease in diabetic patients from the Northwest of Iran and 
noncompliance with the prescribed diet by the physician and lack of timely 
medicine intake were the main reasons for uncontrolled disease.
