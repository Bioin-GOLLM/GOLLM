Establishment of infection by spotted fever group rickettsial species is 
dependent on the ability of these bacteria to adhere to and invade the host 
endothelium. Recent studies have attributed these processes to a handful of 
rickettsial surface proteins from the surface cell antigen (sca) family of 
autotransporters. A rickettsial autotransporter from Rickettsia conorii, Sca2, 
has been shown to be sufficient to mediate both adherence and invasion of human 
endothelial cells and to participate in intracellular actin-based motility. Here 
we identify a region of Sca2 capable of interacting with the mammalian cell 
surface and show that this function of Sca2 is independent and separable from 
its actin nucleation activity. Furthermore, pre-incubation of mammalian cells 
with the Sca2 mammalian association region prior to R. conorii infection can 
competitively inhibit rickettsial invasion, suggesting that Sca2 plays an 
important role in the initial interaction with mammalian cells. Together, our 
results demonstrate that the Sca2 autotransporter protein in R. conorii contains 
distinct functional domains that likely are involved in mediating cellular 
interactions at the plasma membrane and the host cytosol.
