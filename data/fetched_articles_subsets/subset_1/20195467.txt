After two decades of quiescence, epidemic resurgence of Chikungunya fever 
(CHIKF) was reported in Africa, several islands in the Indian Ocean, South-East 
Asia and the Pacific causing unprecedented morbidity with some cases of 
fatality. Early phylogenetic analyses based on partial sequences of Chikungunya 
virus (CHIKV) have led to speculation that the virus behind recent epidemics may 
result in greater pathogenicity. To understand the reasons for these new 
epidemics, we first performed extensive analyses of existing CHIKV sequences 
from its introduction in 1952 to 2009. Our results revealed the existence of a 
continuous genotypic lineage, suggesting selective pressure is active in CHIKV 
evolution. We further showed that CHIKV is undergoing mild positive selection, 
and that site-specific mutations may be driven by cell-mediated immune pressure, 
with occasional changes that resulted in the loss of human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) class I-restricting elements. These findings provide a basis to understand 
Chikungunya virus evolution and reveal the power of post-genomic analyses to 
understand CHIKV and other viral epidemiology. Such an approach is useful for 
studying the impact of host immunity on pathogen evolution, and may help 
identify appropriate antigens suitable for subunit vaccine formulations.
