To assess vaccine immunogenicity in non-infected and previously infected 
individuals in a real-world scenario, SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were 
determined during follow-up 2 (April 2021) of the population-based Tirschenreuth 
COVID-19 cohort study comprising 3378 inhabitants of the Tirschenreuth county 
aged 14 years or older. Seronegative participants vaccinated once with 
Vaxzevria, Comirnaty, or Spikevax had median neutralizing antibody titers 
ranging from ID50 = 25 to 75. Individuals with two immunizations with Comirnaty 
or Spikevax had higher median ID50s (of 253 and 554, respectively). Regression 
analysis indicated that both increased age and increased time since vaccination 
independently decreased RBD binding and neutralizing antibody levels. 
Unvaccinated participants with detectable N-antibodies at baseline (June 2020) 
revealed a median ID50 of 72 at the April 2021 follow-up. Previously infected 
participants that received one dose of Vaxzevria or Comirnaty had median ID50 to 
929 and 2502, respectively. Individuals with a second dose of Comirnaty given in 
a three-week interval after the first dose did not have higher median antibody 
levels than individuals with one dose. Prior infection also primed for high 
systemic IgA levels in response to one dose of Comirnaty that exceeded IgA 
levels observed after two doses of Comirnaty in previously uninfected 
participants. Neutralizing antibody levels targeting the spike protein of Beta 
and Delta variants were diminished compared to the wild type in vaccinated and 
infected participants.
