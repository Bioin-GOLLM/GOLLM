INTRODUCTION: Inherited macrothrombocytopenia represents a heterogeneous group 
of disorders which are characterized by the presence of a reduced number of 
abnormally large platelets in the circulation, which may or may not be 
associated with a bleeding tendency. In spite of several causative genes having 
been identified, the underlying genetic defects remain to be identified in 
approximately half of the cases.
AIMS: To understand the molecular pathology of isolated giant platelet disorder 
from India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 112 cases that were referred for investigation 
of macrothrombocytopenia. Agonist induced platelet aggregation and platelet 
GP1b/IX/V receptor expression were investigated to assess GP1b/IX/V receptor 
expression and the GP1BA, GP1BB, GP9, ABCG5, ABCG8, TUBB1 and MYH9 genes were 
analysed to identify candidate gene defects.
RESULTS: Twenty-three candidate gene defects were identified in 48 of 112 cases, 
20 of which were novel. Of the candidate defects identified, 91% were missense 
and 9% were nonsense variations. The missense variations were in GP9 (9), ABCG5 
(4), GP1BB (3), GP1BA (3) and MYH9 (2), while the nonsense defects occurred in 
MYH9 (1) and GP1BA (1).
CONCLUSIONS: This study increases the understanding of the molecular basis of an 
isolated giant platelet disorder, a common heterogeneous condition prevalent in 
north and eastern India.
