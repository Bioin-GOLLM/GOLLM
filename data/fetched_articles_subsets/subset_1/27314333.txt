R-spondin 1 (Rspo1) plays an essential role in stem cell biology by potentiating 
Wnt signaling activity. Despite the fact that Rspo1 holds therapeutic potential 
for a number of diseases, its biogenesis is not fully elucidated. All Rspo 
proteins feature two amino-terminal furin-like repeats, which are responsible 
for Wnt signal potentiation, and a thrombospondin type 1 (TSR1) domain that can 
provide affinity towards heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Using chemical 
inhibitors, deglycosylase and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that human 
Rspo1 and Rspo3 are both N-glycosylated at N137, a site near the C-terminus of 
the furin repeat 2 domain, and Rspo2 is N-glycosylated at N160, a position near 
the N-terminus of TSR1 domain. Elimination of N-glycosylation at these sites 
affects their accumulation in media but have no effect on the ability towards 
heparin. Introduction of the N-glycosylation site to Rspo2 mutant at the 
position homologous to N137 in Rspo1 restored full glycosylation and rescued the 
accumulation defect of nonglycosylated Rspo2 mutant in media. Similar effect can 
be observed in the N137 Rspo1 or Rspo3 mutant engineered with Rspo2 
N-glycosylation site. The results highlight the importance of N-glycosylation at 
these two positions in efficient folding and secretion of Rspo family. Finally, 
we further showed that human Rspo1 is subjected to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
quality control in N-glycan-dependent manner. While N-glycan of Rspo1 plays a 
role in its intracellular stability, it had little effect on secreted Rspo1. Our 
findings provide evidence for the critical role of N-glycosylation in the 
biogenesis of Rspo1.
