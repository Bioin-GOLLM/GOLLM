Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS; MIM #122470, 300590, 610759, 614701, 300882) 
is a rare and clinically variable disorder that affects multiple organs. It is 
characterized by intellectual disability (mild to severe), distinctive facial 
features, prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, and hirsutism. Congenital 
anomalies include malformations of the upper limbs, gastrointestinal 
malformation/rotation, pyloric stenosis, diaphragmatic hernia, heart defects and 
genitourinary malformations. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is present in 
almost all patients. In addition to classic forms, milder phenotypes have been 
reported. To date five genes [NIPBL (Nipped-B-like protein), SMC1A (structural 
maintenance of chromosomes 1A), SMC3 (structural maintenance of chromosomes 3), 
RAD21 (human homolog of Schizosaccharomyces pombe radiation sensitive mutant 21) 
and HDAC8 (histone deacetylase 8)] have been associated with CdLS and mutations 
of these genes comprise the underlying defect in 70% of the patients. Here, we 
will provide a brief review of the clinical features of CdLS, summarize the 
known underlying genetic defects, prenatal and postnatal diagnosis 
possibilities, and genetic counseling.
