BACKGROUND: Sortilin and SorCS2 are part of the Vps10p receptor family. They 
have both been studied in nervous tissue with several important functions 
revealed, while their expression and possible functions in developing peripheral 
tissue remain poorly understood. Here we deliver a thorough characterization of 
the prenatal localization of sortilin and SorCS2 in mouse peripheral tissue.
RESULTS: Sortilin is highly expressed in epithelial tissues of the developing 
lung, nasal cavity, kidney, pancreas, salivary gland and developing intrahepatic 
bile ducts. Furthermore tissues such as the thyroid gland, developing cartilage 
and ossifying bone also show high expression of sortilin together with cell 
types such as megakaryocytes in the liver. SorCS2 is primarily expressed in 
mesodermally derived tissues such as striated muscle, adipose tissue, ossifying 
bone and general connective tissue throughout the body, as well as in lung 
epithelia. Furthermore, the adrenal gland and liver show high expression of 
SorCS2 in embryos 13.5 days old.
CONCLUSIONS: The possible functions relating to the expression patterns of 
Sortilin and SorCS2 in development are numerous and hopefully this paper will 
help to generate new hypotheses to further our understanding of the Vps10p 
receptor family.
