A significant number of proteins are annotated as functionally uncharacterized 
proteins. Within this protocol, we describe how to use protein family multiple 
sequence alignments and structural bioinformatics resources to design 
loss-of-function mutations of previously uncharacterized proteins within the 
glycosyltransferase family. We detail approaches to determine target protein 
active sites using three-dimensional modeling. We generate active site mutants 
and quantify any changes in enzymatic function by a glycosyltransferase assay. 
With modifications, this protocol could be applied to other metal-dependent 
enzymes. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please 
refer to Ilina et al. (2022).1.
