BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to assess the disease burden and to study the 
molecular genetic characteristics of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 
(HeFH) patients within the Uzbek population to develop a program of early 
disease detection and effective treatment measures.
METHODS: 201 patients were included in the study, of whom 57 with chronic stable 
coronary artery disease (SCAD) and HeFH, and 144 with SCAD without HeFH 
belonging to the control group, and divided into two subgroups: A, statin free 
before the study (n = 63) and B (n = 81), who took statin outpatiently. We 
applied the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Criteria (DLCN) to diagnose HeFH. Serum 
level of PCSK-9 was measured with the ELISA Kit. The genetic typing at PCSK9 
E670G (rs505151) polymorphism was performed with the PCR-RFLP method.
RESULTS: Underestimation of early lipid studies and inadequate treatment in HeHF 
patients within the Uzbek population are accompanied by a 1.8-time increase of 
more frequent history of myocardial infarction (p < 0.05), a 3-time stroke 
(p < 0.05) and 2-time percutaneous coronary intervention (p < 0.05). The study 
of genotypes and alleles of PCSK9 E670G (rs505151) polymorphism allowed to state 
that сarriage of the «damaging » allele G in SCAD and HeHF patients was 2 times 
higher (11.4%), than in non HeHF (6.0%) and 3 times (3.0%) than in healthy ones, 
but the differences were not significant. Herewith, G-carriership is accompanied 
by a higher incidence of myocardial infarction (p < 0.05) and stroke (p < 0.05), 
coronary artery bypass grafting in anamnesis (p < 0.001), and number of plaques 
in carotids (p < 0.05). In group I of SCAD patients with HeFH, 18 (31.6%) cases 
of diabetes mellitus were observed, which did not exceed their number in group 
II (48, 33.3%). However, most of them were carriers of the G allele (82.0%, 
p < 0.001). Despite treatment with rosuvastatin 20-40 mg/day, in HeHF patients 
after 3 months, the level of total cholesterol (p < 0.001) and LDL-C (p < 0.001) 
was significantly higher than in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of early diagnosis of FH, including genetic 
confirmation, and preventional high-intensity statin therapy or a combination of 
statins with ezetimibe to achieve the target level of LDL-C, is the closest 
tactical objective for prevention of MACE within the Uzbek population.
