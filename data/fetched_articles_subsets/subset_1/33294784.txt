Ectodomain (EC) shedding defines the proteolytic removal of a membrane protein 
EC and acts as an important molecular switch in signaling and other cellular 
processes. Using tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α as a model substrate, we identify 
a non-canonical shedding activity of SPPL2a, an intramembrane cleaving aspartyl 
protease of the GxGD type. Proline insertions in the TNFα transmembrane (TM) 
helix strongly increased SPPL2a non-canonical shedding, while leucine mutations 
decreased this cleavage. Using biophysical and structural analysis, as well as 
molecular dynamic simulations, we identified a flexible region in the center of 
the TNFα wildtype TM domain, which plays an important role in the processing of 
TNFα by SPPL2a. This study combines molecular biology, biochemistry, and 
biophysics to provide insights into the dynamic architecture of a substrate's TM 
helix and its impact on non-canonical shedding. Thus, these data will provide 
the basis to identify further physiological substrates of non-canonical shedding 
in the future.
