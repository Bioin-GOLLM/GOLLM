Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common and fatal malignancies, 
which is a significant global health problem. The clinical applicability of 
traditional surgery and other locoregional therapies is limited, and these 
therapeutic strategies are far from satisfactory in improving the outcomes of 
advanced HCC. In the past decade, targeted therapy had made a ground-breaking 
progress in advanced HCC. Those targeted therapies exert antitumor effects 
through specific signals, including anti-angiogenesis or cell cycle progression. 
As a standard systemic therapy option, it tremendously improves the survival of 
this devastating disease. Moreover, the combination of targeted therapy with 
immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has demonstrated more potent anticancer 
effects and becomes the hot topic in clinical studies. The combining medications 
bring about a paradigm shift in the treatment of advanced HCC. In this review, 
we presented all approved targeted agents for advanced HCC with an emphasis on 
their clinical efficacy, summarized the advances of multi-target drugs in 
research for HCC and potential therapeutic targets for drug development. We also 
discussed the exciting results of the combination between targeted therapy and 
ICI.
