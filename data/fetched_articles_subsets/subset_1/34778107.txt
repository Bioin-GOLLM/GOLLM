OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of aztreonam-avibactam-auranofin 
(ATM-AVI-AUR) against a collection of 88 carbapenemase-producing 
Enterobacterales (CPE) clinical isolates and 6 in vitro selected 
ATM-AVI-resistant CPE with CMY-16 Tyr150Ser and Asn346His mutants or 
transformants.
METHODS: MICs of imipenem, ceftazidime-avibact8am (CAZ-AVI), ATM-AVI, 
CAZ-AVI-AUR and ATM-AVI-AUR were determined via the broth microdilution method. 
Genetic background and carbapenemase genes were determined by PCR and Sanger 
sequencing.
RESULTS: AUR alone showed little antibacterial activity with AUR MICs were 
greater than 64 μg/mL for all the 88 clinical CPE isolates. The addition of AUR 
(16 μg/mL) resulted in an 3-folding dilutions MIC reduction of ATM-AVI MIC50 
(0.5 to 0.0625 μg/mL) and a 2-folding dilutions MIC reduction of MIC90 (1 to 
0.25 μg/mL) against all 88 clinical CPE isolates, respectively. Notably, the 
reduced ATM-AVI MIC values were mainly found in MBL-producers, and the MIC50 and 
MIC90 reduced by 2-folding dilutions (0.25 to 0.0625 μg/mL) and 3-folding 
dilutions (2 to 0.25 μg/mL) respectively by AUR among the 51 MBL-producers. By 
contrast, the addition of AUR did not showed significant effects on ATM-AVI 
MIC50 (0.0625 μg/mL) and MIC90 (0.125 μg/mL) among single KPC-producers. 
Interestingly, the addition of AUR restored the ATM-AVI susceptibility against 
the 6 in vitro selected ATM-AVI-resistant CMY-16 Tyr150Ser and Asn346His mutants 
or transfromants, with the MICs reduced from ≥32 μg/mL (32->256 μg/mL) to ≤8 
μg/mL (0.0625-8 μg/mL).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that AUR potentiated the activities of 
CAZ-AVI and ATM-AVI against MBL-producing isolates in vitro. Importantly, AUR 
restored the ATM-AVI activity against ATM-AVI resistant mutant strains. As a 
clinically approved drug, AUR might be repurposed in combination with ATM-AVI to 
treat infections caused by highly resistant MBL-producing Enterobacterales.
