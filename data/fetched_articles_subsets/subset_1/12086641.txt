Inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) channels are important regulators of resting 
membrane potential and cell excitability. The activity of Kir channels is 
critically dependent on the integrity of channel interactions with 
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). Here we identify and 
characterize channel-PIP(2) interactions that are conserved among Kir family 
members. We find basic residues that interact with PIP(2), two of which have 
been associated with Andersen's and Bartter's syndromes. We show that several 
naturally occurring mutants decrease channel-PIP(2) interactions, leading to 
disease.
