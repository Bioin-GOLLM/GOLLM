BACKGROUND: Recently, point mutations in the Perforin gene on chromosome 10q21 
have been described to be the cause of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) 
in a subset of patients. Small deletions, missense, or nonsense mutations were 
found in both coding exons of the gene. One mutation was found apparently 
independently in different families of Turkish origin. This Trp374stop mutation 
is located within a cystein-rich epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor type 
domain in exon 3 of the Perforin gene.
PROCEDURE: To detect this mutation, we developed a rapid "fluorescence resonance 
energy transfer" (FRET) assay on the LightCycler based on the different melting 
behavior of mutated and wild-type sequences.
RESULTS: In seven out of 20 analyzed patients with defined HLH history, this 
Trp374stop mutation was detectable within the different genotypes. Additionally, 
one out of 90 alleles tested in 45 healthy Turkish controls had this mutation.
DISCUSSION: We present a rapid and reliable test for the most common Perforin 
(Trp374stop) mutation in HLH suitable for genetic testing and prenatal 
diagnosis. The mutation was detected in a large proportion of Turkish patients. 
Furthermore, a rapid and precise diagnosis of HLH will shorten the initiation of 
therapy in this subset of patients.
