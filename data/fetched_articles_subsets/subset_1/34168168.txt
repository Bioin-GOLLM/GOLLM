The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) has raised important questions about its origins and the mechanism 
of its transfer to humans. A further question was whether companion or 
commercial animals could act as SARS-CoV-2 vectors, with early data suggesting 
susceptibility is species specific. To better understand SARS-CoV-2 species 
susceptibility, we undertook an in silico structural homology modelling, 
protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics simulation study of SARS-CoV-2 
spike protein's ability to bind angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from 
relevant species. Spike protein exhibited the highest binding to human (h)ACE2 
of all the species tested, forming the highest number of hydrogen bonds with 
hACE2. Interestingly, pangolin ACE2 showed the next highest binding affinity 
despite having a relatively low sequence homology, whereas the affinity of 
monkey ACE2 was much lower despite its high sequence similarity to hACE2. These 
differences highlight the power of a structural versus a sequence-based approach 
to cross-species analyses. ACE2 species in the upper half of the predicted 
affinity range (monkey, hamster, dog, ferret, cat) have been shown to be 
permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting a correlation between binding 
affinity and infection susceptibility. These findings show that the earliest 
known SARS-CoV-2 isolates were surprisingly well adapted to bind strongly to 
human ACE2, helping explain its efficient human to human respiratory 
transmission. This study highlights how in silico structural modelling methods 
can be used to rapidly generate information on novel viruses to help predict 
their behaviour and aid in countermeasure development.
