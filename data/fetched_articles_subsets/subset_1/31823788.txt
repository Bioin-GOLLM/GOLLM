BACKGROUND: Brain metastasis (BM) is one of the principal causes of mortality 
for lung cancer patients. While the molecular events that govern BM of lung 
cancer remain frustrating cloudy.
METHODS: The miRNA expression profiles are checked in the paired human BM and 
primary lung cancer tissues. The effect of miR-143-3p on BM of lung cancer cells 
and its related mechanisms are investigated.
RESULTS: miR-143-3p is upregulated in the paired BM tissues as compared with 
that in primary cancer tissues. It can increase the invasion capability of in 
vitro blood brain barrier (BBB) model and angiogenesis of lung cancer by 
targeting the three binding sites of 3'UTR of vasohibin-1 (VASH1) to inhibit its 
expression. Mechanistically, VASH1 can increase the ubiquitylation of VEGFA to 
trigger the proteasome mediated degradation, further, it can endow the tubulin 
depolymerization through detyrosination to increase the cell motility. m6A 
methyltransferase Mettl3 can increase the splicing of precursor miR-143-3p to 
facilitate its biogenesis. Moreover, miR-143-3p/VASH1 axis acts as adverse 
prognosis factors for in vivo progression and overall survival (OS) rate of lung 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work implicates a causal role of the miR-143-3p/VASH1 axis in 
BM of lung cancers and suggests their critical roles in lung cancer 
pathogenesis.
