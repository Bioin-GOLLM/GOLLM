A cell-line (UACC 2561), was established from a biopsy specimen of a lung 
carcinosarcoma. The patient had Stage III non-small cell lung cancer. 
Characterization of this cell line revealed highly aneuploid cells containing 
multiple clonal chromosome alterations with growth in nude mice within 3 weeks 
following subcutaneous injection. The cell line UACC 2561 stained positive for 
vimentin and displayed resistance to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents. 
Polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformational polymorphism 
analysis revealed the presence of a K-ras 12 codon mutation. This mutation was 
confirmed by mutation specific PCR analysis for mutant K-ras alleles and direct 
DNA sequencing to be a GGT to GTT at codon 12 of the K-ras gene. Examination by 
PCR-SSCP for p53 mutations did not reveal any point mutations in exon 5-8 of the 
p53 gene. This relatively rare cell line may represent a useful model to 
investigate human lung sarcomas.
