PURPOSE: Adoptive T-cell immunotherapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or 
genetically-modified T cells has yielded dramatic results in some cancers. 
However, T cells need to traffic properly into tumors to adequately exert 
therapeutic effects.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The chemokine CCL2 was highly secreted by malignant pleural 
mesotheliomas (MPM; a planned tumor target), but the corresponding chemokine 
receptor (CCR2) was minimally expressed on activated human T cells transduced 
with a chimeric antibody receptor (CAR) directed to the MPM tumor antigen 
mesothelin (mesoCAR T cells). The chemokine receptor CCR2b was thus transduced 
into mesoCAR T cells using a lentiviral vector, and the modified T cells were 
used to treat established mesothelin-expressing tumors.
RESULTS: CCR2b transduction led to CCL2-induced calcium flux and increased 
transmigration, as well as augmentation of in vitro T-cell killing ability. A 
single intravenous injection of 20 million mesoCAR + CCR2b T cells into 
immunodeficient mice bearing large, established tumors (without any adjunct 
therapy) resulted in a 12.5-fold increase in T-cell tumor infiltration by day 5 
compared with mesoCAR T cells. This was associated with significantly increased 
antitumor activity.
CONCLUSIONS: CAR T cells bearing a functional chemokine receptor can overcome 
the inadequate tumor localization that limits conventional CAR targeting 
strategies and can significantly improve antitumor efficacy in vivo.
