HYPOTHESIS: Different missense mutations of the optic atrophy 1 gene (OPA1) 
identified in optic atrophy patients with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder 
(ANSD) induce functional impairment through different molecular mechanisms.
BACKGROUND: OPA1 is the gene responsible for autosomal dominant optic atrophy 
(ADOA), but some of its mutations are also associated with ANSD. OPA1 is a 
member of the GTPase family of proteins and plays a key role in the maintenance 
of mitochondrial activities that are dependent on dimer formation of the 
protein. There are many reports of OPA1 mutations, but the molecular mechanisms 
of their functional impairments are unclear.
METHODS: The sequences of coding regions in OPA1 were analyzed from blood 
samples of ADOA patients with ANSD. Molecular modeling of the protein's ability 
to form dimers and its GTP-binding ability were conducted to study the effects 
of structural changes in OPA1 caused by two identified mutations and their 
resultant effects on protein function.
RESULTS: Two heterozygous mutations, p.T414P (c.1240A>C) and p.T540P 
(c.1618A>C), located in the GTPase and middle domains of OPA1, respectively, 
were identified in two patients. Molecular modeling indicated decreased dimer 
formation caused by destabilization of the association structure of the p.T414P 
mutant, and decreased GTP-binding caused by destabilization of the binding site 
structure in the p.T540P mutant.
CONCLUSION: These two different conformational changes might result in decreased 
GTPase activities that trigger ADOA associated with ANSD, and are likely to be 
associated with mild clinical features. Molecular modeling would provide useful 
information in clinical practice.
