BACKGROUND: Transcriptome analysis has been known as a functional tool for 
cancer research recently. Mounting evidence indicated that calcium signaling 
plays several key roles in cancer progression. Despite numerous studies 
examining calcium signaling in cancer, calcium signaling studies in 
ameloblastoma are limited.
RESULTS: In the present study, comparative transcriptome profiling of two 
representative odontogenic lesions, ameloblastoma and odontogenic keratocyst, 
revealed that Cav1.2 (CACNA1C, an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel) is 
strongly enriched in ameloblastoma. It was confirmed that the Ca2+ influx in 
ameloblastoma cells is mainly mediated by Cav1.2 through L-type voltage-gated 
calcium channel agonist and blocking reagent treatment. Overexpression and 
knockdown of Cav1.2 showed that Cav1.2 is directly involved in the regulation of 
the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 (NFATc1), 
which causes cell proliferation. Furthermore, a tumoroid study indicated that 
Cav1.2-dependent Ca2+ entry is also associated with the maintenance of stemness 
of ameloblastoma cells via the enhancement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Cav1.2 regulates the NFATc1 nuclear translocation to 
enhance ameloblastoma cell proliferation. Furthermore, Cav1.2 dependent Ca2+ 
influx contributes to the Wnt/β-catenin activity for the ameloblastoma cell 
stemness and tumorigenicity. Our fundamental findings could have a major impact 
in the fields of oral maxillofacial surgery, and genetic manipulation or 
pharmacological approaches to Cav1.2 can be considered as new therapeutic 
options.
