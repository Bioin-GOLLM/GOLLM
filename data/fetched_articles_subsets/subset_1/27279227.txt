Precision medicines exert selective pressure on tumour cells that leads to the 
preferential growth of resistant subpopulations, necessitating the development 
of next-generation therapies to treat the evolving cancer. The PIK3CA-AKT-mTOR 
pathway is one of the most commonly activated pathways in human cancers, which 
has led to the development of small-molecule inhibitors that target various 
nodes in the pathway. Among these agents, first-generation mTOR inhibitors 
(rapalogs) have caused responses in 'N-of-1' cases, and second-generation mTOR 
kinase inhibitors (TORKi) are currently in clinical trials. Here we sought to 
delineate the likely resistance mechanisms to existing mTOR inhibitors in human 
cell lines, as a guide for next-generation therapies. The mechanism of 
resistance to the TORKi was unusual in that intrinsic kinase activity of mTOR 
was increased, rather than a direct active-site mutation interfering with drug 
binding. Indeed, identical drug-resistant mutations have been also identified in 
drug-naive patients, suggesting that tumours with activating MTOR mutations will 
be intrinsically resistant to second-generation mTOR inhibitors. We report the 
development of a new class of mTOR inhibitors that overcomes resistance to 
existing first- and second-generation inhibitors. The third-generation mTOR 
inhibitor exploits the unique juxtaposition of two drug-binding pockets to 
create a bivalent interaction that allows inhibition of these resistant mutants.
