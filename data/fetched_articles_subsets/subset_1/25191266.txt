The four-and-half LIM domain protein 1 (FHL1) is highly expressed in skeletal 
and cardiac muscle. Mutations of the FHL1 gene have been associated with diverse 
chronic myopathies including reducing body myopathy, rigid spine syndrome (RSS), 
and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. We investigated a family with a mutation 
(p.C150R) in the second LIM domain of FHL1. In this family, a brother and a 
sister were affected by RSS, and their mother had mild lower limbs weakness. The 
34-year-old female had an early and progressive rigidity of the cervical spine 
and severe respiratory insufficiency. Muscle mass evaluated by DXA was markedly 
reduced, while fat mass was increased to 40%. CT scan showed an almost complete 
substitution of muscle by fibro-adipose tissue. Muscle biopsy showed 
accumulation of FHL1 throughout the cytoplasm and around myonuclei into 
multiprotein aggregates with aggresome/autophagy features as indicated by 
ubiquitin, p62, and LC3 labeling. DNA deposits, not associated with nuclear 
lamina components and histones, were also detected in the aggregates, suggesting 
nuclear degradation. Ultrastructural analysis showed the presence of dysmorphic 
nuclei, accumulation of tubulofilamentous and granular material, and perinuclear 
accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. These data point to involvement of the 
aggresome-autophagy pathway in the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the 
muscle pathology of FHL1 C150R mutation.
