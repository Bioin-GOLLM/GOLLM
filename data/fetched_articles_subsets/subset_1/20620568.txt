BACKGROUND: The genetic cause of eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) has been largely 
unexplored until a recent genome-wide association study identified a disease 
susceptibility locus on 5q22, a region that harbors the thymic stromal 
lymphopoietin (TSLP) gene. However, it is unclear whether the observed genetic 
associations with EE are disease-specific or confounded by the high rate of 
allergy in patients with EE. In addition, the genetic contributions of other 
allergy-associated genes to EE risk have not been explored.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to delineate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that 
associated with EE apart from allergy.
METHODS: We used a custom array containing 738 SNPs in 53 genes implicated in 
allergic responses, immune responses, or both to genotype 220 allergic or 246 
nonallergic control subjects and a discovery cohort of 170 patients with EE. We 
replicated a statistically significant SNP association in an independent 
case-control cohort and examined the induction of the candidate gene in primary 
esophageal epithelial cells.
RESULTS: A single SNP residing in the TSLP gene reached Bonferroni linkage 
disequilibrium-adjusted significance but only when patients with EE were 
compared with allergic control subjects (rs10062929; P = 4.11 x 10(-5); odds 
ratio, 0.35). A nonsynonymous polymorphism in the thymic stromal lymphopoietin 
receptor (TSLPR) gene on Xp22.3 and Yp11.3 was significantly associated with 
disease only in male patients with EE. Primary esophageal epithelial cells 
expressed TSLP mRNA after Toll-like receptor 3 stimulation.
CONCLUSION: These data collectively identify TSLP as a candidate gene critically 
involved in EE susceptibility beyond its role in promoting T(H)2 responses.
