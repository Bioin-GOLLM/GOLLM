Retinoid acid receptors (RAR) are transcription factors that bind retinoic acid 
(RA), a metabolite of vitamin A. RARs are composed of three subunits encoded by 
RARA, RARB and RARG. In humans, RARB defects cause syndromic microphthalmia. So 
far, no germline pathogenic variants have been identified in RARA or RARG. We 
describe a girl with a de novo mutation NM_000964 c.826C > T (p.Arg276Trp) in 
RARA with symptoms overlapping those described in RARB patients (coloboma, 
muscular hypotonia, dilated pulmonary artery, ectopic kidney). RARA Arg276 
residue is functionally important, as it was previously shown that its 
substitution for Ala or Gln causes a 50- or 21-fold impairment of RA binding, 
respectively. Moreover, in leukemic cells, the p.Arg611Trp mutation in a 
chimeric PML/RARA gene (corresponding to the RARA p.Arg276Trp detected in our 
patient) conferred resistance to therapy by decreasing binding of all-trans RA. 
The functional effect of RARA p.Arg276Trp was further confirmed by in silico 
modeling which showed that binding of RA by the Trp276 variant was similarly 
defective as in the deleterious model Ala276 mutant. We propose that RARA 
p.Arg276Trp causes the disease by affecting RA interaction with the RARA 
receptor.
