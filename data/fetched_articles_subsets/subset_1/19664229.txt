BACKGROUND: Of the fewer than 100 cases reported within the literature of 
constitutional deletions involving the long arm of chromosome 6, only five have 
been characterized using high-resolution microarray analysis. Reported 6q 
deletion patients show a high incidence of mental retardation, ear anomalies, 
hypotonia, and postnatal growth retardation.
RESULTS: We report a 16-month-old male presenting with developmental delay and 
dysmorphic features who was found by array-based comparative genomic 
hybridization (aCGH) to have a ~2.16 Mb de novo deletion within chromosome band 
6q16.1 that encompasses only two genes. Expression studies of the mouse 
homologue of one of the genes, the ephrin receptor 7 gene (EPHA7), have shown 
the gene functions during murine embryogenesis to form cortical domains, 
determine brain size and shape, and play a role in development of the central 
nervous system (CNS).
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that deletion of EPHA7 plays a role in the 
neurologic and dysmorphic features, including developmental delay, hypotonia, 
and ear malformations, observed in some 6q deletion patients.
