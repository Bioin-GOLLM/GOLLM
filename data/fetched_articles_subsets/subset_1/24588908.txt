BACKGROUND: Gain of function mutations in B-RAF and N-RAS occur frequently in 
melanoma, leading to mitogen activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway 
activation, and this pathway is the target of drugs in development. Our purpose 
was to study clinical characteristics of patients with mutations in this pathway 
and to determine activity of inhibitors of B-RAF and MEK in short term cultures 
grown from tumors of some of these patients.
METHODS: Clinical and pathologic data were collected retrospectively on melanoma 
patients tested for B-RAF and N-RAS mutations at the Yale Cancer Center and 
associations with survival were determined. We studied in vitro activity of the 
pan-RAF inhibitor, RAF265, and the MEK inhibitor, MEK162, in 22 melanoma short 
term cultures. We further characterized the effect of MEK inhibition on 
apoptosis and growth of melanoma cultures.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 144 metastatic melanoma patients we found that patients 
with N-RAS mutant melanoma had a worse prognosis. These patients were more 
likely to have brain metastases at the time of presentation with metastatic 
disease than their N-RAS-wild-type counterparts. All N-RAS mutant melanoma 
cultures tested in our study (n = 7) were sensitive to MEK inhibition 162. 
Exposure to MEK162 reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and induced apoptosis. 
Clonogenic survival was significantly reduced in sensitive melanoma cell 
cultures.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with melanoma expressing constitutively 
active N-RAS is poor, consistent with studies performed at other institutions. 
N-RAS mutant melanoma cultures appear to be particularly sensitive to MEK162, 
supporting ongoing clinical trials with MEK162 in N-RAS mutated melanoma.
