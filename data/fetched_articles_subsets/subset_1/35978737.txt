BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are the most common and serious 
complications in uncontrolled diabetes. Infections are predominantly 
polymicrobial, with aerobic Gram-positive, anerobic, and fungal infections. 
Early detection of fungal infection and initiation of appropriate treatment in 
DFUs may lead to better healing and avoid amputations. The primary objective was 
to find out the prevalence of DFUs getting infected with fungus and the 
secondary objective was to identify the appropriate methodology for the 
detection of the fungus in DFUs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:  This was a cross-sectional observational study carried 
out in a tertiary care hospital with a sample size of 60 DFUs. Microbiological 
analysis was done by swab culture and deep tissue culture. Observational 
data were collected and the significance level was statistically analyzed.
RESULTS:  In the present study, the prevalence of fungal infections in DFUs was 
31.7%. Only fungal tissue was positive in 15%, the fungal swab was positive in 
8.33%, and both tissue and swab were positive in 8.33%. All these patients were 
treated with antifungal treatment as per the culture report in addition to 
appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
CONCLUSION:  A fungal culture should be done in all patients with non-healing 
DFUs. Both fungal swab and tissue culture testing should be advocated in 
patients with DFUs for better mycological evaluation. The addition of antifungal 
medications may provide better outcomes in selected cases.
