BACKGROUND: Mutations in the SLC4A1 gene have been found to cause either 
autosomal dominant (AD) or autosomal recessive (AR) distal renal tubular 
acidosis (dRTA). The SLC4A1 mutations causing AD dRTA were reported in white 
patients, whereas those associated with AR dRTA were often found in Southeast 
Asia. Here, the authors report additional novel SLC4A1 mutations in 3 patients 
with AR dRTA from 2 unrelated Thai families.
METHODS: The patients and members of their families were clinically studied. Red 
cell morphology and sulfate influx were examined. The SLC4A1 gene was screened, 
analyzed, and confirmed for mutations by molecular genetic techniques.
RESULTS: In the first family, the patient had dRTA, rickets, failure to thrive, 
nephrocalcinosis, and hypokalemic-hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with a urine 
pH level of 7.00. He had novel compound heterozygous SLC4A1 G701D/S773P 
mutations, inherited from clinically normal heterozygous mother and father. In 
the second family, the patient and his sister had dRTA and Southeast Asian 
ovalocytosis (SAO) with different clinical severity. The patient had proximal 
muscle weakness, rickets, nephrocalcinosis, hypokalemia, normal anion gap 
metabolic acidosis, and urine pH level of 6.80. His sister was asymptomatic but 
the urine pH level could not be lowered to below 5.50 after a short acid load. 
Both siblings had compound heterozygous SLC4A1 SAO/R602H mutations.
CONCLUSION: Two novel compound heterozygous SLC4A1 G701D/S773P and SAO/R602H 
mutations were identified in Thai patients with AR dRTA.
