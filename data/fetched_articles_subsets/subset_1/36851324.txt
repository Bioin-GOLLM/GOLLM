We evaluated neutralizing antibody (NAbs) levels as a protective factor against 
vaccine breakthrough infection (VBI) in healthcare workers (HCWs) during the 
third COVID-19 wave in Peru. This retrospective cohort study employed the 
information from a private laboratory in Lima (Peru) of HCW who received only 
two BBIBP-CorV vaccines or (additionally) a heterologous booster with BNT162b2. 
We evaluated the association between the VBI and the levels of NAbs at 21, 90, 
180, and 210 days after the BBIBP-CorV second dose. NAbs were calculated with 
the cPass™ SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection kit (surrogate virus 
neutralization test (sVNT)) and the Elecsys® anti-SARS-CoV-2 S Test. Of the 435 
HCW evaluated, 31.72% had an infection previous to vaccination, 68.28% received 
a booster dose, and 23.21% had a VBI during the third wave. The variables 
associated with a lower risk of VBI were male sex (aRR: 0.43) and those who had 
(180 days after BBIBP-CorV inoculation) NAbs levels ≥ 60% (aRR: 0.58) and ≥90% 
(aRR: 0.59) on cPass™, and ≥500 with Elecsys® (aRR: 0.58). HCW whose NAbs 
persisted at higher levels six months after the BBIBP-CorV showed a lower risk 
of suffering from a VBI during the third COVID-19 wave.
