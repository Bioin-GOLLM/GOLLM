50 years ago, Vincent Allfrey and colleagues discovered that lymphocyte 
activation triggers massive acetylation of chromatin. However, the molecular 
mechanisms driving epigenetic accessibility are still unknown. We here show that 
stimulated lymphocytes decondense chromatin by three differentially regulated 
steps. First, chromatin is repositioned away from the nuclear periphery in 
response to global acetylation. Second, histone nanodomain clusters decompact 
into mononucleosome fibers through a mechanism that requires Myc and continual 
energy input. Single-molecule imaging shows that this step lowers transcription 
factor residence time and non-specific collisions during sampling for DNA 
targets. Third, chromatin interactions shift from long range to predominantly 
short range, and CTCF-mediated loops and contact domains double in numbers. This 
architectural change facilitates cognate promoter-enhancer contacts and also 
requires Myc and continual ATP production. Our results thus define the nature 
and transcriptional impact of chromatin decondensation and reveal an unexpected 
role for Myc in the establishment of nuclear topology in mammalian cells.
