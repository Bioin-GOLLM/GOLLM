Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated skin disease 
affecting about 2% of the world's population. According to current knowledge, 
psoriasis is a complex disease that involves various genes and environmental 
factors, such as stress, injuries, infections and certain medications. The 
chronic inflammation of psoriasis lesions develops upon epidermal infiltration, 
activation, and expansion of type 1 and type 17 Th cells. Despite the enormous 
progress in understanding the mechanisms that cause psoriasis, the target cells 
and antigens that drive pathogenic T cell responses in psoriatic lesions are 
still unproven and the autoimmune basis of psoriasis still remains hypothetical. 
However, since the identification of the Th17 cell subset, the IL-23/Th17 immune 
axis has been considered a key driver of psoriatic inflammation, which has led 
to the development of biologic agents that target crucial elements of this 
pathway. Here we present the current understanding of various aspects in 
psoriasis pathogenesis.
