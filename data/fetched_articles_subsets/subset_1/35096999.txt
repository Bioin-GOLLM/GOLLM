We reported a case of sitosterolemia, which is a rare genetic disease, 
characterized by increased plant sterol absorption and great heterogeneity of 
clinical manifestations. Our patient was initially referred to the lipid clinic 
due to high cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease. Diagnosis 
of familial hypercholesterolemia was established in accordance with the Dutch 
Lipid Clinic Network criteria. Next-generation sequencing was later performed, 
which revealed a nonsense mutation in the ABCG8 gene, which led to the diagnosis 
of sitosterolemia. The aim of our report is to demonstrate, how genetic testing 
helped to make the correct diagnosis and to explain many of the patient's health 
problems, which etiology remained unclear for many years.
