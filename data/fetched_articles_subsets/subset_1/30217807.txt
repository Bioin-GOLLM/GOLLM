BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a bone-derived hormone that 
regulates phosphorus and vitamin D metabolism, contributes to the pathogenesis 
of mineral and bone disorders in CKD and is an emerging cardiovascular risk 
factor. Central elements of FGF23 regulation remain incompletely understood; 
genetic variation may help explain interindividual differences.
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of 
circulating FGF23 concentrations among 16,624 participants of European ancestry 
from seven cohort studies, excluding participants with eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 
m2 to focus on FGF23 under normal conditions. We evaluated the association of 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with natural log-transformed FGF23 
concentration, adjusted for age, sex, study site, and principal components of 
ancestry. A second model additionally adjusted for BMI and eGFR.
RESULTS: We discovered 154 SNPs from five independent regions associated with 
FGF23 concentration. The SNP with the strongest association, rs17216707 
(P=3.0×10-24), lies upstream of CYP24A1, which encodes the primary catabolic 
enzyme for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Each additional copy 
of the T allele at this locus is associated with 5% higher FGF23 concentration. 
Another locus strongly associated with variations in FGF23 concentration is 
rs11741640, within RGS14 and upstream of SLC34A1 (a gene involved in renal 
phosphate transport). Additional adjustment for BMI and eGFR did not materially 
alter the magnitude of these associations. Another top locus (within ABO, the 
ABO blood group transferase gene) was no longer statistically significant at the 
genome-wide level.
CONCLUSIONS: Common genetic variants located near genes involved in vitamin D 
metabolism and renal phosphate transport are associated with differences in 
circulating FGF23 concentrations.
