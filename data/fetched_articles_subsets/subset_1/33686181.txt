Saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid promote inflammation and insulin 
resistance in peripheral tissues, contrasting with the protective action of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids such docosahexaenoic acid. Palmitic acid effects 
have been in part attributed to its potential action through Toll-like receptor 
4. Beside, resistin, an adipokine, also promotes inflammation and insulin 
resistance via TLR4. In the brain, palmitic acid and resistin trigger 
neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, but their link at the neuronal level 
is unknown. Using human SH-SY5Yneuroblastoma cell line we show that palmitic 
acid treatment impaired insulin-dependent Akt and Erk phosphorylation whereas 
DHA preserved insulin action. Palmitic acid up-regulated TLR4 as well as 
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNFα contrasting with DHA effect. Similarly 
to palmitic acid, resistin treatment induced the up-regulation of IL6 and TNFα 
as well as NFκB activation. Importantly, palmitic acid potentiated the 
resistin-dependent NFkB activation whereas DHA abolished it. The recruitment of 
TLR4 to membrane lipid rafts was increased by palmitic acid treatment; this is 
concomitant with the augmentation of resistin-induced TLR4/MYD88/TIRAP complex 
formation mandatory for TLR4 signaling. In conclusion, palmitic acid increased 
TLR4 expression promoting resistin signaling through TLR4 up-regulation and its 
recruitment to membrane lipid rafts.
