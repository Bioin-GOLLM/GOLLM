Inflammation involves a series of complex biological processes mediated by 
innate immunity for host defense against pathogen infection. Chronic 
inflammation is considered to be one of the major causes of serious diseases, 
including a number of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases, cancers, cardiovascular 
diseases, and neurological diseases. Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 
(MFG-E8) is a secreted protein found in vertebrates and was initially discovered 
as a critical component of the milk fat globule. Previously, a number of studies 
have reported that MFG-E8 contributes to various biological functions including 
the phagocytic removal of damaged and apoptotic cells from tissues, the 
induction of VEGF-mediated neovascularization, the maintenance of intestinal 
epithelial homeostasis, and the promotion of mucosal healing. Recently, emerging 
studies have reported that MFG-E8 plays a role in inflammatory responses and 
inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. This review describes the characteristics of 
MFG-E8-mediated signaling pathways, summarizes recent findings supporting the 
roles of MFG-E8 in inflammatory responses and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, 
and discusses MFG-E8 targeting as a potential therapeutic strategy for the 
development of anti-inflammatory/autoimmune disease drugs.
