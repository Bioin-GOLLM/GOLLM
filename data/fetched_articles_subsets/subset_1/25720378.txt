BACKGROUND: Several genetic studies have evaluated the association between 
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) A299G polymorphism and the risk of pneumonia. 
However, the results were not consistent. We thus did this meta-analysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Relevant studies were systematically searched by using the 
NCBI, Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases. Data were extracted 
independently by 2 investigators. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.
RESULTS: Eight case-control studies with 658 patients and 1862 controls were 
included in this meta-analysis. TLR4 A299G polymorphism was significantly 
associated with pneumonia risk (OR=1.74; 95% CI 1.19-2.53; P=0.004). The result 
was significant in adults. In addition, TLR4 A299G polymorphism was also 
associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) risk. Results from cumulative 
meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis suggested that the results are reliable 
and robust.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that susceptibility to 
pneumonia was associated with TLR4 A299G polymorphism.
