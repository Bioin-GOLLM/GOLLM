cAMP is a second messenger that regulates a myriad of cellular functions in 
response to multiple extracellular stimuli. New developments in the field have 
provided exciting insights into how cAMP utilizes compartmentalization to ensure 
specificity when the message conveyed to the cell by an extracellular stimulus 
is translated into the appropriate functional outcome. cAMP compartmentalization 
relies on the formation of local signaling domains where the subset of cAMP 
signaling effectors, regulators and targets involved in a specific cellular 
response cluster together. These domains are dynamic in nature and underpin the 
exacting spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP signaling. In this review, we focus 
on how the proteomics toolbox can be utilized to identify the molecular 
components of these domains and to define the dynamic cellular cAMP signaling 
landscape. From a therapeutic perspective, compiling data on compartmentalized 
cAMP signaling in physiological and pathological conditions will help define the 
signaling events underlying disease and may reveal domain-specific targets for 
the development of precision medicine interventions.
