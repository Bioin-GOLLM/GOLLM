INTRODUCTION: Phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency (PGAM) is a rare metabolic 
myopathy that results in terminal block in glycogenolysis. Clinically, patients 
with PGAM deficiency are asymptomatic, except when they engage in brief, 
strenuous efforts, which may trigger myalgias, cramps, muscle necrosis, and 
myoglobinuria. An unusual pathologic feature of PGAM deficiency is the 
association with tubular aggregates.
METHODS: We report an African-American patient from Panama with partial 
deficiency of PGAM who presented with asymptomatic elevation of creatine kinase 
levels and tubular aggregates on muscle biopsy.
RESULTS: Muscle biopsies showed subsarcolemmal and sarcolemmal tubular 
aggregates in type 2 fibers. Muscle PGAM enzymatic activity was decreased and 
gene sequencing revealed a heterozygous mutation in codon 78 of exon 1 of the 
PGAM2 gene, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 7.
CONCLUSIONS: PGAM deficiency has been reported in 14 patients, 9 of whom were of 
African-American ethnicity, and in 5 (36%) tubular aggregates were seen on 
muscle biopsy. Contrary to previously reported cases, our patient was initially 
asymptomatic. This further expands the PGAM deficiency phenotype.
