The Indian blood group system (ISBT: IN/023) consists of two antithetical 
antigens: In(a) (IN1), which is present in approximately 10 percent of some Arab 
populations and in 3 percent of Bombay Indians, and its allelic antigen In(b) 
(IN2), an antigen of high incidence in all populations. In 2007, two new 
high-incidence antigens were identified as belonging to the IN blood group 
system, namely IN3 (INFI) and IN4 (INJA). The antigens in this system are 
located on CD44, a single-pass membrane glycoprotein that is encoded by the CD44 
gene on chromosome 11 at position p13. The biologic function of CD44 is as a 
leukocyte homing receptor and cellular adhesion molecule. The In(a) and In(b) 
polymorphism represents a 252G>C substitution of CD44, encoding R46P, and lack 
of IN3 and IN4 results from homozygosity for mutations encoding H85Q and T163R 
in the CD44 gene. The high-frequency antigen AnWj (901009) has not been assigned 
to the Indian system, but either is located on an isoform of CD44 or is closely 
associated with it.
