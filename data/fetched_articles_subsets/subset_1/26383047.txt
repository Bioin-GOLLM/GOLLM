BACKGROUND: Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by 
deleterious mutations in the coagulation factor VIII gene (F8). To date, F8 
mutations have been documented predominantly in European subjects and in 
American subjects of European descent. Information on F8 variants in individuals 
of more diverse ethnic backgrounds is limited.
OBJECTIVES: To discover novel and rare F8 variants, and to characterize F8 
variants in diverse population backgrounds.
PATIENTS/METHODS: We analyzed 2535 subjects, including 26 different ethnicities, 
whose data were available from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) phase 3 dataset, 
for F8 variants and their potential functional impact.
RESULTS: We identified 3030 single nucleotide variants, 31 short deletions and 
insertions (Indels) and a large, 497 kb, deletion. Among all variants, 86.4% 
were rare variants and 55.6% were novel. Eighteen variants previously associated 
with HA were found in our study. Most of these 'HA variants' were 
ethnic-specific with low allele frequency; however, one variant (p.M2257V) was 
present in 27% of African subjects. The p.E132D, p.T281A, p.A303V and p.D422H 
'HA variants' were identified only in males. Twelve novel missense variants were 
predicted to be deleterious. The large deletion was discovered in eight female 
subjects without affecting F8 transcription and the transcription of genes on 
the X chromosome.
CONCLUSION: Characterizing F8 in the 1000G project highlighted the complexity of 
F8 variants and the importance of interrogating genetic variants on multiple 
ethnic backgrounds for associations with bleeding and thrombosis. The haplotype 
analysis and the orientation of duplicons that flank the large deletion 
suggested that the deletion was recurrent and originated by homologous 
recombination.
