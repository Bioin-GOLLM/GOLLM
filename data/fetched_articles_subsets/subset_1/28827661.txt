Distant metastasis is the main cause of breast cancer-related death; however, 
effective therapeutic strategies targeting metastasis are still scarce. This is 
largely attributable to the spatiotemporal intratumor heterogeneity during 
metastasis. Here we show that protein deacetylase SIRT7 is significantly 
downregulated in breast cancer lung metastases in human and mice, and predicts 
metastasis-free survival. SIRT7 deficiency promotes breast cancer cell 
metastasis, while temporal expression of Sirt7 inhibits metastasis in 
polyomavirus middle T antigen breast cancer model. Mechanistically, SIRT7 
deacetylates and promotes SMAD4 degradation mediated by β-TrCP1, and SIRT7 
deficiency activates transforming growth factor-β signaling and enhances 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Significantly, resveratrol activates SIRT7 
deacetylase activity, inhibits breast cancer lung metastases, and increases 
survival. Our data highlight SIRT7 as a modulator of transforming growth 
factor-β signaling and suppressor of breast cancer metastasis, meanwhile 
providing an effective anti-metastatic therapeutic strategy.Metastatic disease 
is the major reason for breast cancer-related deaths; therefore, a better 
understanding of this process and its players is needed. Here the authors report 
the role of SIRT7 in inhibiting SMAD4-mediated breast cancer metastasis 
providing a possible therapeutic avenue.
