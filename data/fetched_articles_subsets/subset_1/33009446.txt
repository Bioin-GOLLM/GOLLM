Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare tubulopathy characterized by 
urinary concentration defect due to renal resistance to vasopressin. 
Loss-of-function mutations of vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) gene (AVPR2) is the 
most common cause of the disease. We have identified five novel mutations L86P, 
R113Q, C192S, M272R, and W323_I324insR from NDI-affected patients. Functional 
characterization of these mutants revealed that R113Q and C192S were normally 
localized at the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby Canine Kidney 
(MDCK) cells and presented proper glycosylation maturation. On the other side, 
L86P, M272R, and W323_I324insR mutants were retained in endoplasmic reticulum 
and exhibited immature glycosylation and considerably reduced stability. All 
five mutants were resistant to administration of vasopressin analogues as 
evaluated by defective response in cAMP release. In order to rescue the function 
of the mutated V2R, we tested VX-809, sildenafil citrate, ibuprofen and 
tolvaptan in MDCK cells. Among these, tolvaptan was effective in rescuing the 
function of M272R mutation, by both allowing proper glycosylation maturation, 
membrane sorting and response to dDAVP. These results show an important proof of 
concept for the use of tolvaptan in patients affected by M272R mutation of V2R 
causing NDI.
