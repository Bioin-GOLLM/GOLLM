BACKGROUND: Human loss-of-function variants of ANK2 (ankyrin-B) are linked to 
arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. However, their in vivo effects and 
specific arrhythmogenic pathways have not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: We identified new ANK2 variants in 25 unrelated Han Chinese probands 
with ventricular tachycardia by whole-exome sequencing. The potential pathogenic 
variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. We performed functional and 
mechanistic experiments in ankyrin-B knockin (KI) mouse models and in single 
myocytes isolated from KI hearts.
RESULTS: We detected a rare, heterozygous ANK2 variant (p.Q1283H) in a proband 
with recurrent ventricular tachycardia. This variant was localized to the ZU5C 
region of ANK2, where no variants have been previously reported. KI mice 
harboring the p.Q1283H variant exhibited an increased predisposition to 
ventricular arrhythmias after catecholaminergic stress in the absence of cardiac 
structural abnormalities. Functional studies illustrated an increased frequency 
of delayed afterdepolarizations and Ca2+ waves and sparks accompanied by 
decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content in KI cardiomyocytes on 
isoproterenol stimulation. The immunoblotting results showed increased levels of 
phosphorylated ryanodine receptor Ser2814 in the KI hearts, which was further 
amplified on isoproterenol stimulation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments 
demonstrated dissociation of protein phosphatase 2A from ryanodine receptor in 
the KI hearts, which was accompanied by a decreased binding of ankyrin-B to 
protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B56Î±. Finally, the administration of 
metoprolol or flecainide decreased the incidence of stress-induced ventricular 
arrhythmias in the KI mice.
CONCLUSIONS: ANK2 p.Q1283H is a disease-associated variant that confers 
susceptibility to stress-induced arrhythmias, which may be prevented by the 
administration of metoprolol or flecainide. This variant is associated with the 
loss of protein phosphatase 2A activity, increased phosphorylation of ryanodine 
receptor, exaggerated delayed afterdepolarization-mediated trigger activity, and 
arrhythmogenesis.
