Stimulation of autophagy could provide powerful therapies for multiple diseases, 
including cancer and neurodegeneration. An attractive drug target for this 
purpose is Bcl-2, which inhibits autophagy by binding to the Beclin 1 
BH3-domain. However, compounds that preclude Beclin 1/Bcl-2 binding might also 
induce apoptosis, which is inhibited by binding of Bcl-2 to BH3-domains of 
pro-apoptosis factors such as Bax. Here we describe the NMR structure of Bcl-2 
bound to 35, a compound that we recently found to inhibit Beclin 1/Bcl-2 binding 
more potently than Bax/Bcl-2 binding. The structure shows that 35 binds at one 
end of the BH3-binding groove of Bcl-2. Interestingly, much of the 35-binding 
site is not involved in binding to Bcl-2 inhibitors described previously and 
mediates binding to Beclin 1 but not Bax. The structure suggests potential 
avenues to design compounds that disrupt Beclin 1/Bcl-2 binding and stimulate 
autophagy without inducing apoptosis.
