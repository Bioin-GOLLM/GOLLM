Studies on bone development, formation and turnover have grown exponentially 
over the last decade in part because of the utility of genetic models. One area 
that has received considerable attention has been the phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which has emerged as a major survival network 
for osteoblasts. Genetic engineering has enabled investigators to study 
downstream effectors of PI3K by directly overexpressing activated forms of AKT 
in cells of the skeletal lineage or deleting Pten that leads to a constitutively 
active AKT. The results from these studies have provided novel insights into 
bone development and remodeling, critical processes in the lifelong maintenance 
of skeletal health. This paper reviews those data in relation to recent advances 
in osteoblast biology and their potential relevance to chronic disorders of the 
skeleton and their treatment.
