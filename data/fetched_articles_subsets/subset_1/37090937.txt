OBJECTIVES: To report a novel likely pathogenic variant in the SERAC1 gene 
associated with early adult-onset parkinsonism and progressive dystonia.
METHODS: Clinical, biochemical, and imaging assessments were performed on 2 
affected adult brothers with a genetically unsolved progressive neurologic 
disorder followed by whole-genome sequencing.
RESULTS: A homozygous likely pathogenic variant in the SERAC1 gene (c.[129-2A > 
C], p.[(?)];[(?)]) was discovered.
DISCUSSION: We describe a novel homozygous variant in the serine active 
site-containing protein 1 gene (SERAC1) in 2 brothers with a progressive 
extrapyramidal movement disorder of early onset parkinsonism and dystonia. 
Previous variants have been associated with a severe 3-methylglutaconic aciduria 
with dystonia, deafness, hepatopathy, encephalopathy and Leigh-like syndrome, or 
juvenile onset complicated spastic paraparesis. Our cases expand the phenotype 
of SERAC1 variants, with an adult-onset presentation of dystonia-parkinsonism.
