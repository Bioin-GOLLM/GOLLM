Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes comprise approximately 10% of 
diagnosed cancers; however, familial forms are believed to account for up to 30% 
of some cancers. In Hispanics, the most commonly diagnosed hereditary cancers 
include colorectal cancer syndromes such as, Lynch Syndrome, Familial 
Adenomatous Polyposis, and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes. 
Although the incidence of hereditary cancers is low, patients diagnosed with 
hereditary cancer syndromes are at high-risk for developing secondary cancers. 
Furthermore, the productivity loss that occurs after cancer diagnosis in these 
high-risk patients has a negative socio-economic impact. This review summarizes 
the genetic basis, phenotype characteristics, and the National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network's screening, testing, and surveillance guidelines for the leading 
hereditary cancer syndromes. The aim of this review is to promote a better 
understanding of cancer genetics and genetic testing in Hispanic patients.
