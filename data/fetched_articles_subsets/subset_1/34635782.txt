AKT-phosphorylated IWS1 promotes Histone H3K36 trimethylation and alternative 
RNA splicing of target genes, including the U2AF65 splicing factor-encoding 
U2AF2. The predominant U2AF2 transcript, upon IWS1 phosphorylation block, lacks 
the RS-domain-encoding exon 2, and encodes a protein which fails to bind Prp19. 
Here we show that although both U2AF65 isoforms bind intronless mRNAs containing 
cytoplasmic accumulation region elements (CAR-E), only the RS domain-containing 
U2AF65 recruits Prp19 and promotes their nuclear export. The loading of U2AF65 
to CAR-Elements was RS domain-independent, but RNA PolII-dependent. Virus- or 
poly(I:C)-induced type I IFNs are encoded by genes targeted by the pathway. IWS1 
phosphorylation-deficient cells therefore, express reduced levels of IFNα1/IFNβ1 
proteins, and exhibit enhanced sensitivity to infection by multiple cytolytic 
viruses. Enhanced sensitivity of IWS1-deficient cells to Vesicular Stomatitis 
Virus and Reovirus resulted in enhanced apoptotic cell death via caspase 
activation. Inhibition of this pathway may therefore sensitize cancer cells to 
oncolytic viruses.
