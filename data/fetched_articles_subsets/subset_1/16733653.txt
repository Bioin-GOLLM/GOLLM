The Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
inactivating germline mutations in the serine-threonine kinase gene LKB1, is 
characterized by mucocutaneous pigmentation, multiple gastrointestinal 
hamartomatous polyps, and by an increased risk for developing tumors involving 
several different organs. To date, no brain tumors have been described in PJS 
patients. In this report, we describe a case of ganglioglioma in a 22-year-old 
PJS patient. Single-strand conformation polymorphism-Heteroduplex analysis 
evidenced an abnormal pattern in exon 6 of the LKB1 gene. Sequencing revealed a 
821delTinsAC mutation creating a termination codon 29 nucleotides downstream 
(p.Asn274fsX11). RNA studies showed an out-of-frame LKB1 isoform derived from 
the wild type allele and generated by exon 4 skipping. Since the LKB1 gene is 
expressed in the fetal and adult brain, our data would suggest its likely 
involvement in the pathogenesis of a subset of gangliogliomas.
