N6-Methyldeoxyadenine (6mA) has been rediscovered as a DNA modification with 
potential biological function in metazoans. However, the physiological function 
and regulatory mechanisms regarding the establishment, maintenance and removal 
of 6mA in eukaryotes are still poorly understood. Here we show that genomic 6mA 
levels change in response to pathogenic infection in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. 
elegans). We further identify METL-9 as the methyltransferase that catalyzes DNA 
6mA modifications upon pathogen infection. Deficiency of METL-9 impairs the 
induction of innate immune response genes and renders the animals more 
susceptible to pathogen infection. Interestingly, METL-9 functions through both 
6mA-dependent and -independent mechanisms to transcriptionally regulate innate 
immunity. Our findings reveal that 6mA is a functional DNA modification in 
immunomodulation in C. elegans.
