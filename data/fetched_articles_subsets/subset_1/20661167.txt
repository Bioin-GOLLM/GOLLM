Dysfunction of medullary serotonin (5-HT)-mediated respiratory and autonomic 
function is postulated to underlie the pathogenesis of the majority of sudden 
infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases. Several studies have reported an increased 
frequency of the LL genotype and L allele of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene 
promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), which is associated with increased 
transcriptional activity and 5-HT transport in vitro, in SIDS cases compared 
with controls. These findings raise the possibility that this polymorphism 
contributes to or exacerbates existing medullary 5-HT dysfunction in SIDS. In 
this study, we tested the hypothesis that the frequency of LL genotype and L 
allele are higher in 179 SIDS cases compared with 139 controls of multiple 
ethnicities in the San Diego SIDS Dataset. We observed no significant 
association of genotype or allele with SIDS cases either in the total cohort or 
on stratification for ethnicity. These observations do not support previous 
findings that the L allele and/or LL genotype of the 5-HTTLPR are associated 
with SIDS.
