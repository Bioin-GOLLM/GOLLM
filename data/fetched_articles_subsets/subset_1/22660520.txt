Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the third leading cause of death in children 
<1 year of age in Mexico where there is a high prevalence of the 677C → T 
polymorphism of the MTHFR gene. This is important because the homozygous 677T/T 
MTHFR gene and deficiency of folic acid (FA) intake have been associated with 
CHD. Our objective was to analyze the possible association between the genotype 
677T/T of the MTHFR gene and supplementation of FA in Mexican women with the 
presence of complex CHD in their children. We analyzed genotypes of 31 mothers 
of children with complex CHD (group I) and 62 mothers of healthy children (group 
II) and investigated FA supplementation during pregnancy in both study groups. 
Allele frequencies in group I were 41.9 % for C and 58.1 % for T and 22.6 % for 
genotype frequencies CC, 38.7 % for CT, and 38.7 % for TT. Allele frequencies in 
group II were 63.7 % for C and 36.3 % for T and 38.7 % for genotype frequencies 
CC, 50 % for CT and 11.3 % for TT. Both populations are in Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium. Odds ratio for having a child with a complex CHD was 5.9, p = 0.008 
(95 % CI 1.67; 20.63) for the TT genotype. FA supplementation at any time during 
pregnancy was 90.3 and 87.9 % in groups II and I respectively (p > 0.05). 
Association was found between the maternal genotype (677/TT MTHFR) with the 
presence of complex CHD in their offspring. No differences in FA supplementation 
during any stage were found between groups.
