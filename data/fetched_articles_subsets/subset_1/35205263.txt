We obtained four mitochondrial genomes of Odontocolon sp., Xorides funiuensis, 
Euceros kiushuensis and Euceros serricornis, which represent the first two 
representatives from subfamily Eucerotinae and Xoridinae (Ichneumonidae), 
respectively. All of the 4 newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes contain 13 
protein-coding genes (PCGs) and most 24 RNA genes. Furthermore, they all have 
novel tRNA rearrangement patterns comparing with published mitogenomes in 
Ichneumonidae. For the tRNA cluster trnI-trnQ-trnM, X. funiuensis is shuffled as 
trnM-trnI-trnQ with trnQ inversed, while Odontocolon sp. with a remote 
translocation of trnK, shuffling as trnI-trnM-trnQ. E. kiushuensis and E. 
serricornis shared the same cluster trnQ-trnY-trnW-trnC. Finally, we 
reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among the sequenced subfamilies of 
Ichneumonidae based on nucleotides and amino acids sequences of 13 PCGs in 
mitochondrial genomes, and the results of both the maximum likelihood and 
Bayesian inference analyses highly support that Eucerotinae is the basal 
ichneumonid lineage rather than Xoridinae.
