OBJECTIVE: The molecular basis of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) 
remains elusive. While germline gain-of-function mutations in the RET 
proto-oncogene cause hereditary MTC, somatic activating RET mutations and loss 
of heterozygosity of markers in various chromosomal regions representing 
deletions of tumour suppressor genes, have been described in a variable number 
of sporadic MTC. A previous report suggested that the presence of a germline 
variant at RET codon 836 (S836S) was associated with the development of sporadic 
MTC and, furthermore, that the presence of S836S was highly correlated with 
somatic RET M918T mutation in the MTC. Thus, we sought to determine if the S836S 
variant would be associated with sporadic MTC from a completely different 
population base, that of Andalucia.
DESIGN: This is a case-control study to determine whether the presence of RET 
germline S836S is correlated with sporadic MTC in Andalucia.
PATIENTS: Thirty-two patients with sporadic MTC from the Andalucia region of 
Spain, serviced by our University Hospital, were ascertained throughout the 
period 1995-99. Sporadic MTC was defined as a lack of personal or family history 
suggestive of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) and lack of germline 
RET mutations which define any MEN 2 subtype. A region and race matched cohort 
of 250 controls was also obtained.
MEASUREMENTS: The frequency of the S836S allele was determined in cases and 
controls and compared using the standard chi-squared statistic and Fisher's 
exact test.
RESULTS: The polymorphic allele frequency at codon 836 in the control population 
(18/500 chromosomes, 3.6%) differed significantly from the MTC case cohort, 9.3% 
of case chromosomes (six of 64 alleles, Fisher's exact test, two-tailed, P = 
0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Germline RET S836S variant is associated with a two- to three-fold 
risk of sporadic MTC in the Spanish population, in accordance with a previous 
study based on German cases. Our observations suggest that this phenomenon might 
be universal and not limited to Germany.
