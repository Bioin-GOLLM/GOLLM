UDP-Galactopyranose mutase (UGM) is a unique flavin-dependent enzyme that 
catalyzes the conversion of UDP-galactopyranose(UDP-Galp) to UDP-galactofuranose 
(UDP-Galf). The product of this reaction is the precursor to Galf, a major 
component of the cell wall and of cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids in 
many eukaryotic and prokaryotic human pathogens. The function of UGM is 
important in the virulence of fungi, parasites, and bacteria. Its role in 
virulence and its absence in humans suggest that UGM is an ideal drug target. 
Significant structural and mechanistic information has been accumulated on the 
prokaryotic UGMs; however, in the past few years the research interest has 
shifted to UGMs from eukaryotic human pathogens such as fungi and protozoan 
parasites. It has become clear that UGMs from prokaryotic and eukaryotic 
organisms have different structural and mechanistic features. The amino acid 
sequence identity between these two classes of enzymes is low, resulting in 
differences in oligomeric states, substrate binding, active site flexibility, 
and interaction with redox partners. However, the unique role of the flavin 
cofactor in catalysis is conserved among this enzyme family. In this review, 
recent findings on eukaryotic UGMs are discussed and presented in comparison 
with prokaryotic UGMs.
