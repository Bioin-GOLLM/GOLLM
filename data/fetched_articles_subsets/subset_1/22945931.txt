Rho family small GTPases (Rac, RhoA, and Cdc42) function at the core of 
cytokinesis, the physical division of one cell into two. In this issue, Bastos 
et al. (2012. J. Cell Biol. http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201204107) identify a 
new role for Rac inhibition: to release cell adhesion at the division plane and 
allow efficient constriction of the contractile ring. They show that the 
GTPase-activating protein, CYK4, suppresses equatorial cell substrate adhesion 
by inhibiting Rac and therefore its effectors ARFGEF7 and PAK1/2.
