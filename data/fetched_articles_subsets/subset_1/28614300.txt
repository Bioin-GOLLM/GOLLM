In response to environmental cues that promote IP3 (inositol 
1,4,5-trisphosphate) generation, IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) located on the 
endoplasmic reticulum allow the 'quasisynaptical' feeding of calcium to the 
mitochondria to promote oxidative phosphorylation. However, persistent Ca2+ 
release results in mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and consequent apoptosis. Among 
the three mammalian IP3Rs, IP3R3 appears to be the major player in 
Ca2+-dependent apoptosis. Here we show that the F-box protein FBXL2 (the 
receptor subunit of one of 69 human SCF (SKP1, CUL1, F-box protein) ubiquitin 
ligase complexes) binds IP3R3 and targets it for ubiquitin-, p97- and 
proteasome-mediated degradation to limit Ca2+ influx into mitochondria. 
FBXL2-knockdown cells and FBXL2-insensitive IP3R3 mutant knock-in clones display 
increased cytosolic Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and 
sensitization to Ca2+-dependent apoptotic stimuli. The phosphatase and tensin 
homologue (PTEN) gene is frequently mutated or lost in human tumours and 
syndromes that predispose individuals to cancer. We found that PTEN competes 
with FBXL2 for IP3R3 binding, and the FBXL2-dependent degradation of IP3R3 is 
accelerated in Pten-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts and PTEN-null cancer cells. 
Reconstitution of PTEN-null cells with either wild-type PTEN or a catalytically 
dead mutant stabilizes IP3R3 and induces persistent Ca2+ mobilization and 
apoptosis. IP3R3 and PTEN protein levels directly correlate in human prostate 
cancer. Both in cell culture and xenograft models, a non-degradable IP3R3 mutant 
sensitizes tumour cells with low or no PTEN expression to photodynamic therapy, 
which is based on the ability of photosensitizer drugs to cause Ca2+-dependent 
cytotoxicity after irradiation with visible light. Similarly, disruption of 
FBXL2 localization with GGTi-2418, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, 
sensitizes xenotransplanted tumours to photodynamic therapy. In summary, we 
identify a novel molecular mechanism that limits mitochondrial Ca2+ overload to 
prevent cell death. Notably, we provide proof-of-principle that inhibiting IP3R3 
degradation in PTEN-deregulated cancers represents a valid therapeutic strategy.
