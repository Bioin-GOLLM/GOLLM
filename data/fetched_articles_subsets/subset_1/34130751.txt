BACKGROUND: There are geographic variations in the genotypes of Helicobacter 
pylori (H. pylori) cagA, vacA, iceA, oipA and dupA. The aim of the study was to 
investigate the distribution of these genotypes among H. pylori strains from 
five regions of China and their association with clinical outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gastric biopsy specimens were obtained from 348 patients 
with different gastrointestinal diseases in the five regions of China. The 
regional distribution was 89 patients from Shandong, 91 from Guangxi, 57 from 
Hunan, 58 from Qinghai and 53 from Heilongjiang. The presence of cagA, vacA, 
iceA, oipA and dupA genotypes was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
from H. pylori DNA.
RESULTS: A total of 269 H. pylori isolates were obtained, of which 74 isolates 
were from Shandong, 78 from Guangxi, 46 from Hunan, 33 from Qinghai and 38 from 
Heilongjiang. The cagA-positive status was predominant in the five regions. The 
predominant vacA genotypes were s1c (73.4%), m2 (70.6%) and i1 (92.9%). In 
strains from Shandong, s1a and m1 were dominant. By contrast, s1c was dominant 
in Guangxi and i1 was dominant in Hunan and Heilongjiang. The prevalence of m2 
subtype in Qinghai (78.8%) was significantly higher than that in other regions 
(P < 0.05). The predominant iceA genotype was iceA1 and the frequency of iceA1 
was significantly more prevalent in Hunan than in other regions (P < 0.05). The 
oipA status "on" gene was more frequent in Shandong (91.9%) and Guangxi (91%) 
than in Heilongjiang (71.7%) (P < 0.05). Conversely, the dupA-positive status 
was less than half in Shandong (31.1%) and Guangxi (15.4%), whereas it was 73.9% 
in Hunan and 81.8% in Qinghai (P < 0.001). There were no significant 
associations between the cagA, vacA, iceA, oipA genotypes and clinical outcomes. 
The dupA-positive strains were more common in peptic ulcer disease (PUD) 
patients than in non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) patients in Shandong and Guangxi 
(P < 0.05), but the association was not observed in other geographic regions.
CONCLUSIONS: There was significant geographic diversity of H. pylori genotypes 
in different regions of China and the presence of dupA gene can be considered as 
a marker for the development of gastroduodenal diseases. However, the cagA, 
iceA, vacA and oipA genes cannot be regarded for prediction of the clinical 
presentation of H. pylori infection in China.
