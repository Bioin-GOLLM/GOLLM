CYP1A2, one of the major members of cytochrome P450 in human liver, participates 
in the metabolism of various drugs. While most harmful mutations are located 
near the catalytic core of CYP1A2, a recently found loss-of-function mutation, 
F186L, is on the surface. By far, function of this superficial residue remains 
unclear. In this paper, 7-ethoxyresorufin, a widely used agent in benchmarking 
the O-deethylation activities of CYP1A subfamily enzymes, was employed as a 
substrate to investigate the impact of the F186L mutation through ensemble 
docking and molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that the F186L mutation 
altered the binding inclination of the substrate through a series of changes on 
the catalytic pocket, which are, actually, long-range effects. The activities of 
access channels in the enzyme are also affected by the F186L mutation and the 
substrate binding. Based on these findings, a detailed mechanism of how F186 
regulates the functions of CYP1A2 was proposed, and it may shed light on the 
diverse effects of SNPs and the personalized drug design.
