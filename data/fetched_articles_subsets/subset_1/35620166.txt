Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects more 
women than men. The pathomechanism underlying the sex disparity, especially in 
the brain, is unclear. ABCA7 is one of the strongest susceptibility genes for 
Alzheimer's disease. It mediates the transport of lipids across membranes and is 
associated with pathways related to amyloid-β neuropathology. However, the role 
of ABCA7 in the regulation of brain lipids is largely unknown. Sex-specific 
differences in the pathological link between brain lipid dysregulation and 
amyloid-β are also unknown. Here, we undertook quantitative discovery lipidomics 
of male and female Abca7 knockout (n = 52) and wild type (n = 35) mouse brain 
using sophisticated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. We identified 61 
lipid subclasses in the mouse brain and found sex-specific differences in lipids 
that were altered with Abca7 deletion. The altered lipids belong to cellular 
pathways that control cell signalling, sterol metabolism, mitochondrial function 
and neuroprotection. We also investigated the relationship between lipids and 
amyloid-β levels in the Abca7 knockout mice and found elevated free cholesterol 
only in female mice that was significantly correlated with amyloid-β42 levels. 
In male Abca7 knockout mice, the neuroprotective ganglioside GD1a levels were 
elevated and inversely correlated with amyloid-β42 levels. Collectively, these 
results demonstrate that Abca7 deletion leads to sex-specific lipid 
dysregulation in the brain, providing insight into the underlying sex disparity 
in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease.
