Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common age-related 
condition that represents a potential pre-phase of hematologic neoplasm. 
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is used to detect and monitor clonal 
hematopoiesis, and the spectrum of mutations substantially overlaps with that of 
myeloid neoplasms with DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, and JAK2 being the most frequently 
mutated. While, in general, the risk of progression to an overt myeloid neoplasm 
is only modest, the progression risk increases in patients with unexplained 
cytopenia or multiple mutations. In addition, CHIP represents a previously 
unrecognized major risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), including coronary heart disease, degenerative aortic valve stenosis, and 
chronic heart failure; and a causative role of CHIP in the development of CVD 
has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The management of patients with CHIP 
is a rapidly emerging topic in personalized medicine, as NGS has become widely 
available for clinical medicine. It requires a highly multidisciplinary setting, 
including hematology/oncology, cardiology, (clinical) pathology, and genetics 
for individualized guidance. Further research is urgently needed to provide 
robust evidence for future guidelines and recommendations on the management of 
patients with CHIP in the era of personalized medicine.
