Cellular senescence is a state of stable growth arrest and a desired outcome of 
tumor suppressive interventions. Treatment with many anti-cancer drugs can cause 
premature senescence of non-malignant cells. These therapy-induced senescent 
cells can have pro-tumorigenic and pro-disease functions via activation of an 
inflammatory secretory phenotype (SASP). Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 
4/6 (CDK4/6i) have recently proven to restrain tumor growth by activating a 
senescence-like program in cancer cells. However, the physiological consequence 
of exposing the whole organism to pharmacological CDK4/6i remains poorly 
characterized. Here, we show that exposure to CDK4/6i induces non-malignant 
cells to enter a premature state of senescence dependent on p53. We observe in 
mice and breast cancer patients that the CDK4/6i-induced senescent program 
activates only a partial SASP enriched in p53 targets but lacking 
pro-inflammatory and NF-κB-driven components. We find that CDK4/6i-induced 
senescent cells do not acquire pro-tumorigenic and detrimental properties but 
retain the ability to promote paracrine senescence and undergo clearance. Our 
results demonstrate that SASP composition is exquisitely stress-dependent and a 
predictor for the biological functions of different senescence subsets.
