Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type 1a (von Gierke disease) is an autosomal 
recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase 
(G6Pase). We have identified a novel mutation in the G6Pase gene of a individual 
with GSD type 1a. The cDNA from the patient's liver revealed a 91-nt deletion in 
exon 5. The genomic DNA from the patient's white blood cells revealed no 
deletion or mutation at the splicing junction of intron 4 and exon 5. The 3' 
splicing occurred 91 bp from the 5' site of exon 5 (at position 732 in the 
coding region), causing a substitution of a single nucleotide (G to T) at 
position 727 in the coding region. Further confirmation of the missplicing was 
obtained by transient expression of allelic minigene constructs into animal 
cells. Another eight unrelated families of nine Japanese patients were all found 
to have this mutation. This mutation is a new type of splicing mutation in the 
G6Pase gene, and 91% of patients and carriers suffering from GSD1a in Japan are 
detectable with this splicing mutation.
