Sequence-specific DNA binding activators of gene transcription may be assisted 
by SWI2 (SNF2), which contains a DNA-dependent ATPase domain. We have isolated a 
human complementary DNA encoding a 205K nuclear protein, BRG1, that contains 
extensive homology to SWI2 and Drosophila brahma. We report here that a 
SWI2/BRG1 chimera with the DNA-dependent ATPase domain replaced by corresponding 
human sequence restored normal mitotic growth and capacity for transcriptional 
activation to swi2- yeast cells. Point mutation of the conserved ATP binding 
site lysine abolished this complementation. This mutation in SWI2 exerted a 
dominant negative effect on transcription in yeast. A lysine to arginine 
substitution at the corresponding residue of BRG1 also generated a 
transcriptional dominant negative in human cells. BRG1 is exclusively nuclear 
and present in a high M(r) complex of about 2 x 10(6). These results show that 
the SWI2 family DNA-dependent ATPase domain has functional conservation between 
yeast and humans and suggest that a SWI/SNF protein complex is required for the 
activation of selective mammalian genes.
