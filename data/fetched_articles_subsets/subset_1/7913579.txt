Mutations in the AVPR2 gene encoding the receptor for arginine vasopressin in 
the kidney (V2 ADHR) have been reported in patients with congenital nephrogenic 
diabetes insipidus, a predominantly X-linked disorder of water homeostasis. We 
have used restriction-enzyme analysis and direct DNA sequencing of genomic PCR 
product to evaluate the AVPR2 gene in 11 unrelated affected males. Each patient 
has a different DNA sequence variation, and only one matches a previously 
reported mutation. Cosegregation of the variations with nephrogenic diabetes 
insipidus was demonstrated for two families, and a de novo mutation was 
documented in two additional cases. Carrier detection was accomplished in one 
family. All the variations predict frameshifts, truncations, or nonconservative 
amino acid substitutions in evolutionarily conserved positions in the V2 ADHR 
and related receptors. Of interest, a 28-bp deletion is found in one patient, 
while another, unrelated patient has a tandem duplication of the same 28-bp 
segment, suggesting that both resulted from the same unusual unequal 
crossing-over mechanism facilitated by 9-mer direct sequence repeats. Since the 
V2 ADHR is a member of the seven-transmembrane-domain, G-protein-coupled 
receptor superfamily, the loss-of-function mutations from this study and others 
provide important clues to the structure-function relationship of this and 
related receptors.
