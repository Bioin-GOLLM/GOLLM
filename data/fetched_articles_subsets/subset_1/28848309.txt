IN BRIEF Although the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial, which 
spanned more than 8 years, did not find significant differences in 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality between study groups, it did demonstrate 
significant differences in weight loss and maintenance. Using lessons learned 
from the Look AHEAD protocol, clinicians can help people with type 2 diabetes 
lose weight, improve glucose management, increase physical activity, alter 
eating patterns, and support long-term positive health outcomes. It remains 
important, however, to avoid assigning a higher priority to weight loss goals 
than to improvements in glucose management, long-term health outcomes, and 
quality of life.
