Apoptosis is an important defense mechanism mounted by the immune system to 
control virus replication. Hence, cytomegaloviruses (CMV) evolved and acquired 
numerous anti-apoptotic genes. The product of the human CMV (HCMV) UL36 gene, 
pUL36 (also known as vICA), binds to pro-caspase-8, thus inhibiting 
death-receptor apoptosis and enabling viral replication in differentiated THP-1 
cells. In vivo studies of the function of HCMV genes are severely limited due to 
the strict host specificity of cytomegaloviruses, but CMV orthologues that 
co-evolved with other species allow the experimental study of CMV biology in 
vivo. The mouse CMV (MCMV) homolog of the UL36 gene is called M36, and its 
protein product (pM36) is a functional homolog of vICA that binds to murine 
caspase-8 and inhibits its activation. M36-deficient MCMV is severely growth 
impaired in macrophages and in vivo. Here we show that pUL36 binds to the murine 
pro-caspase-8, and that UL36 expression inhibits death-receptor apoptosis in 
murine cells and can replace M36 to allow MCMV growth in vitro and in vivo. We 
generated a chimeric MCMV expressing the UL36 ORF sequence instead of the M36 
one. The newly generated MCMVUL36 inhibited apoptosis in macrophage lines RAW 
264.7, J774A.1, and IC-21 and its growth was rescued to wild type levels. 
Similarly, growth was rescued in vivo in the liver and spleen, but only 
partially in the salivary glands of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. In conclusion, we 
determined that an immune-evasive HCMV gene is conserved enough to functionally 
replace its MCMV counterpart and thus allow its study in an in vivo setting. As 
UL36 and M36 proteins engage the same molecular host target, our newly developed 
model can facilitate studies of anti-viral compounds targeting pUL36 in vivo.
