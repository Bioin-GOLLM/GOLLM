BACKGROUND: Diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) are highly invasive brain tumors with 
rare survival beyond two years past diagnosis and limited understanding of the 
mechanism behind tumor invasion. Previous reports demonstrate upregulation of 
the protein ID1 with H3K27M and ACVR1 mutations in DMG, but this has not been 
confirmed in human tumors or therapeutically targeted.
METHODS: Whole exome, RNA, and ChIP-sequencing was performed on the ID1 locus in 
DMG tissue. Scratch-assay migration and transwell invasion assays of cultured 
cells were performed following shRNA-mediated ID1-knockdown. In vitro and in 
vivo genetic and pharmacologic [cannabidiol (CBD)] inhibition of ID1 on DMG 
tumor growth was assessed. Patient-reported CBD dosing information was 
collected.
RESULTS: Increased ID1 expression in human DMG and in utero electroporation 
(IUE) murine tumors is associated with H3K27M mutation and brainstem location. 
ChIP-sequencing indicates ID1 regulatory regions are epigenetically active in 
human H3K27M-DMG tumors and prenatal pontine cells. Higher ID1-expressing 
astrocyte-like DMG cells share a transcriptional program with 
oligo/astrocyte-precursor cells (OAPCs) from the developing human brain and 
demonstrate upregulation of the migration regulatory protein SPARCL1. Genetic 
and pharmacologic (CBD) suppression of ID1 decreases tumor cell 
invasion/migration and tumor growth in H3.3/H3.1K27M PPK-IUE and human 
DIPGXIIIP* in vivo models of pHGG. The effect of CBD on cell proliferation 
appears to be non-ID1 mediated. Finally, we collected patient-reported CBD 
treatment data, finding that a clinical trial to standardize dosing may be 
beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS: H3K27M-mediated re-activation of ID1 in DMG results in a SPARCL1+ 
migratory transcriptional program that is therapeutically targetable with CBD.
