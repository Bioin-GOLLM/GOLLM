The majority of human prion diseases are sporadic, but acquired disease can 
occur, as seen with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) following 
consumption of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). With increasing rates of 
cervid chronic wasting disease (CWD), there is concern that a new form of human 
prion disease may arise. Currently, there is no evidence of transmission of CWD 
to humans, suggesting the presence of a strong species barrier; however, in 
vitro and in vivo studies on the zoonotic potential of CWD have yielded mixed 
results. The emergence of different CWD strains is also concerning, as different 
strains can have different abilities to cross species barriers. Given that 
venison consumption is common in areas where CWD rates are on the rise, 
increased rates of human exposure are inevitable. If CWD was to infect humans, 
it is unclear how it would present clinically; in vCJD, it was strain-typing of 
vCJD prions that proved the causal link to BSE. Therefore, the best way to 
screen for CWD in humans is to have thorough strain-typing of harvested cervids 
and human CJD cases so that we will be in a position to detect atypical strains 
or strain shifts within the human CJD population.
