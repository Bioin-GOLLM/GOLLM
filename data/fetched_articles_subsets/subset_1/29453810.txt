BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a popular arthrosis featured as pain, limited 
joint activity, and deformity. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been reported to be 
up-regulated in arthritic tissues and is integral to the progression of 
osteoarthritis (OA). Previous studies showed the COX-2 promoter G-765C 
polymorphism could influence COX-2 expression. However, the relationship between 
the variant and OA risk is contrasting.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study with 196 primary end-stage hip and 
knee OA cases and 196 controls in a Chinese Han population. Subsequently, we 
integrated this case-control study in a meta-analysis to acquire greater 
statistical power. The results from our case-control study using MassARRAY 
genotyping technology and binary logistic regression statistical methods.
RESULTS: The variant carriers in the Chinese Han population had a lower primary 
end-stage hip and knee OA susceptibility (C vs G: OR = 0.350, 95%CI: 
0.154-0.797, P = .012; GC vs GG: adjusted OR = 0.282, 95%CI: 0.118-0.676, 
P = .005). Stratification studies indicated that a higher GC frequency in women 
decreased not only knee OA susceptibility but also unilateral knee OA risk. The 
meta-analysis showed that the variant exhibited a significantly decreased OA 
risk through comparisons involving allelic, homozygous, heterozygous, and 
dominant models.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the COX-2 G-765C polymorphism exerts a 
protective effect against primary end-stage knee osteoarthritis in a female 
Chinese Han population.
