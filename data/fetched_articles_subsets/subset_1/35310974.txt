Complement C1q binding protein (C1QBP, p32) is primarily localized in 
mitochondrial matrix and associated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylative 
function. C1QBP deficiency presents as a mitochondrial disorder involving 
multiple organ systems. Recently, disease associated C1QBP mutations have been 
identified in patients with a combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 
taking an autosomal recessive inherited pattern. The clinical spectrum ranges 
from intrauterine growth restriction to childhood (cardio) myopathy and 
late-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia. This review summarizes the 
physiological functions of C1QBP, its mutation-associated mitochondrial 
cardiomyopathy shown in the reported available patients and current experimental 
disease platforms modeling these conditions.
