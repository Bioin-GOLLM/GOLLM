Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in our understanding 
of the immunopathogenesis and pharmacogenomics of severe 
immunologically-mediated adverse drug reactions. Such T-cell-mediated adverse 
drug reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(SJS/TEN), drug-induced liver disease (DILI) and other drug hypersensitivity 
syndromes have more recently been shown to be mediated through interactions with 
various class I and II HLA alleles. Key examples have included the associations 
of HLA-B*15:02 and carbamazepine induced SJS/TEN in Southeast Asian populations 
and HLA-B*57:01 and abacavir hypersensitivity. HLA-B*57:01 screening to prevent 
abacavir hypersensitivity exemplifies a successful translational roadmap from 
pharmacogenomic discovery through to widespread clinical implementation. 
Ultimately, our increased understanding of the interaction between drugs and the 
MHC could be used to inform drug design and drive pre-clinical toxicity programs 
to improve drug safety.
