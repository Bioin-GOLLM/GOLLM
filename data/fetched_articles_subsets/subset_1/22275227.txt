BACKGROUND: The function of Notch signaling in murine neural crest-derived cell 
lineages in vivo was examined.
RESULTS: Conditional gain (Wnt1Cre;Rosa(Notch)) or loss (Wnt1Cre;RBP-J(f/f)) of 
Notch signaling in neural crest cells (NCCs) in vivo results in craniofacial, 
cardiac, and trunk abnormalities. Severe craniofacial malformations are apparent 
in Wnt1Cre;Rosa(Notch) embryos, while less severe skull abnormalities are 
evident in Wnt1Cre;RBP-J(f/f) mice. Deficient cardiac neural crest migration, 
resulting in cardiac outflow tract malformations, occurs with increased or 
decreased Notch signaling in NCCs. Smooth muscle cell differentiation also is 
impaired in pharyngeal NCC derivatives in both Wnt1Cre;Rosa(Notch) and 
Wnt1Cre;RBP-J(f/f) embryos. Neurogenesis is absent and gliogenesis is increased 
in the dorsal root ganglia of Wnt1Cre;Rosa(Notch) embryos, while neurogenesis is 
increased and gliogenesis is decreased in Wnt1Cre;RBP-J(f/f) embryos.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these studies demonstrate essential cell-autonomous roles 
for appropriate levels of Notch signaling during NCC migration, proliferation, 
and differentiation with critical implications in craniofacial, cardiac, and 
neurogenic development and disease.
