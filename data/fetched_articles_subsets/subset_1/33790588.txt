Despite the effectiveness of the currently available antiviral drugs in treating 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, high rates of adverse effects are associated 
with their use. Moreover, a problem of increasing importance is the emergence of 
drug-resistant CMV infection. Here, we describe the first case of off-label use 
of letermovir (LMV) as preemptive antiviral therapy, in a pediatric allogeneic 
peripheral blood stem cell transplant recipient with ganciclovir-resistant CMV 
infection who was intolerant to foscarnet and unable to achieve viral clearance 
after seven doses of cidofovir. After the administration of LMV, a gradual 
reduction in viral load was observed and within 6 weeks of LMV treatment, after 
more than 6 months of positive CMV-DNAemia, the patient cleared the infection. 
No adverse effects associated with LMV were observed during treatment. In this 
pediatric study case, the off-label use of LMV for the treatment of CMV 
infection has been well tolerated and proved to be effective in leading to the 
suppression of viral replication.
