Type I (α and β) and type III (λ) interferons (IFNs) induce the expression of a 
large set of antiviral effector molecules via their respective surface membrane 
receptors. Whereas most cell types respond to type I IFN, type III IFN 
preferentially acts on epithelial cells and protects mucosal organs such as the 
lung and gastrointestinal tract. Despite the engagement of different receptor 
molecules, the type I and type III IFN-induced signaling cascade and upregulated 
gene profile is thought to be largely identical. Here, we comparatively analyzed 
the response of gut epithelial cells to IFN-β and IFN-λ2 and identified a set of 
genes predominantly induced by IFN-λ2. We confirm the influence of epithelial 
cell polarization for enhanced type III receptor expression and demonstrate the 
induction of predominantly IFN-λ2-induced genes in the gut epithelium in vivo. 
Our results suggest that IFN-λ2 targets the epithelium and induces genes to 
adjust the antiviral host response to the requirements at mucosal body sites.
