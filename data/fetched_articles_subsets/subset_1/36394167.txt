Systemic glucose metabolism and insulin activity oscillate in response to 
diurnal rhythms and nutrient availability with the necessary involvement of 
adipose tissue to maintain metabolic homeostasis. However, the adipose-intrinsic 
regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, the dynamics of PPARγ acetylation in 
adipose tissue are shown to orchestrate metabolic oscillation in daily rhythms. 
Acetylation of PPARγ displays a diurnal rhythm in young healthy mice, with the 
peak at zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0) and the trough at ZT18. This rhythmic pattern is 
deranged in pathological conditions such as obesity, aging, and circadian 
disruption. The adipocyte-specific acetylation-mimetic mutation of PPARγ K293Q 
(aKQ) restrains adipose plasticity during calorie restriction and diet-induced 
obesity, associated with proteolysis of a core circadian component BMAL1. 
Consistently, the rhythmicity in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity is 
altered in aKQ and the complementary PPARγ deacetylation-mimetic K268R/K293R 
(2KR) mouse models. Furthermore, the PPARγ acetylation-sensitive downstream 
target adipsin is revealed as a novel diurnal factor that destabilizes BMAL1 and 
mediates metabolic rhythms. These findings collectively signify that PPARγ 
acetylation is a hinge connecting adipose plasticity and metabolic rhythms, the 
two determinants of metabolic health.
