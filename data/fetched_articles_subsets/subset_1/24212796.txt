The ability of Wnt ligands to initiate a signaling cascade that results in 
cytoplasmic stabilization of, and nuclear localization of, β-catenin underlies 
their ability to regulate progenitor cell differentiation. In this review, we 
will summarize the current knowledge of the mechanisms underlying Wnt/β-catenin 
signaling and how the pathway regulates normal differentiation of stem cells in 
the intestine, mammary gland, and prostate. We will also discuss how 
dysregulation of the pathway is associated with putative cancer stem cells and 
the potential therapeutic implications of regulating Wnt signaling.
