We report a 4 years girl with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) type 
Ib due to a novel homozygous mutation in MPI gene. She presented with 
diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. CDG should be considered in 
unexplained hypoglycemia particularly in consanguineous families. Diagnosis 
enables monitoring/prevention of disease comorbidities and early effective 
treatment.
