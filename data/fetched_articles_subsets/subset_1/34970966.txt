Activation of T cells requires a rapid surge in cellular protein synthesis. 
However, the role of translation initiation in the early induction of specific 
genes remains unclear. Here, we show human translation initiation factor eIF3 
interacts with select immune system related mRNAs including those encoding the T 
cell receptor (TCR) subunits TCRA and TCRB. Binding of eIF3 to the TCRA and TCRB 
mRNA 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) depends on CD28 coreceptor signaling and 
regulates a burst in TCR translation required for robust T cell activation. Use 
of the TCRA or TCRB 3'-UTRs to control expression of an anti-CD19 chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) improves the ability of CAR-T cells to kill tumor cells 
in vitro. These results identify a new mechanism of eIF3-mediated translation 
control that can aid T cell engineering for immunotherapy applications.
