The breast- and ovarian-cancer-specific tumor suppressor BRCA1 and its 
heterodimeric partner BARD1 contain RING domains that implicate them as E3 
ubiquitin ligases. Despite extensive efforts, the bona fide substrates of 
BRCA1/BARD1 remain elusive. Here, we used recombinant GST fused to four UBA 
domains to enrich ubiquitinated proteins followed by a Lys-ε-Gly-Gly (diGly) 
antibody to enrich ubiquitinated tryptic peptides. This tandem affinity 
purification method coupled with mass spectrometry identified 101 putative 
BRCA1/BARD1 E3 substrates. We identified the histone variant macroH2A1 from the 
screen and showed that BRCA1/BARD1 ubiquitinates macroH2A1 at lysine 123 
in vitro and in vivo. Primary human fibroblasts stably expressing a 
ubiquitination-deficient macroH2A1 mutant were defective in cellular senescence 
compared to their wild-type counterpart. Our study demonstrates that BRCA1/BARD1 
is a macroH2A1 E3 ligase and implicates a role for macroH2A1 K123 ubiquitination 
in cellular senescence.
