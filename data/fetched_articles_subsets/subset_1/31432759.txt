A 13-year-old female with a novel THRB gene mutation (c.1033G>T, p.G345C) 
presented with 3- to 6-fold higher serum iodothyronine levels and more severe 
clinical manifestation than 2 other family members carrying the same mutation. 
The leukocytes of the proband expressed both wild-type and mutant THRB mRNAs, 
excluding the possibility of a partial deletion of the allele not carrying the 
mutation. The proband's fibroblasts showed reduced responsiveness to 
triiodothyronine compared with those of another affected family member. The more 
severe clinical and biochemical phenotype suggest a modifier-mediated worsening 
of the resistance to thyroid hormone.
