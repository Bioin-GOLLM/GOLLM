We have examined for a mutation in the cardiac beta myosin heavy chain gene from 
Japanese patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A missense mutation 
due to a G to A transition in codon 935, leading to a replacement of Glu with 
Lys, was found in one patient. Family members of this patient were then 
examined. It was revealed that both the proband and his elder brother, who was 
also a symptomatic patient, were homozygous for the mutation. The proband 
eventually died of intractable heart failure, and his brother died suddenly in 
their thirties. On the other hand, his parents, who were first cousins and 
heterozygous for the mutation, had cardiac hypertrophy without clinical 
symptoms. His elder sister was also heterozygous for the mutation, however, she 
did not manifest with cardiac hypertrophy. These observations suggest a 
gene-dose-like effect of the mutant cardiac beta myosin heavy chain gene on the 
clinical manifestation of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
