Stress induces extensive reprogramming of mRNA metabolism, which includes the 
transcription and translation of stress-related genes and the formation of 
stress granules. RasGAP SH3 domain-binding proteins (G3BPs, also called 
Rasputins) form a highly conserved family of proteins found throughout 
eukaryotic evolution, which coordinate signal transduction and 
posttranscriptional gene regulation and play a key role in the formation of 
stress granules. G3BPs play a role in osmotic, oxidative, and biotic stress in 
mammals, and recent results revealed that they play similar functions in higher 
plants. Although simple eukaryotes such as yeast have only one G3BP gene, higher 
plants show a massive expansion of their G3BP genes into distinct subfamilies. 
However, because this family of genes has not been well-characterized in plants, 
functions that have evolved during this expansion remain unidentified. 
Therefore, we carried out a phylogenetic analysis of G3BPs in different 
eukaryotes, particularly focusing on the green lineage. On the basis of this 
evolutionary analysis of G3BPs in eukaryotes, we propose a uniform nomenclature 
for plant G3BPs that should help predict the evolutionary and functional 
diversification in this family.
