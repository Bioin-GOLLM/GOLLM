The liver is the most common site of metastases for colorectal cancer. Complete 
resection in some patients with resectable liver metastases (LM) can lead to 
long-term survival and cure. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy after complete 
resection of LM improves recurrence-free survival; however, the overall survival 
benefit is not clear. In selected patients, preoperative systemic treatment for 
metastatic colorectal cancer can convert unresectable to resectable cancer. This 
review will focus on patient selection, and integration of perioperative and 
postoperative systemic treatment to surgery in resectable and initially 
unresectable LM. Additionally, new drugs and biomarkers will be discussed.
