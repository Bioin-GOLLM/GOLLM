Solid cancer progression is dictated by neoplastic cell features and pro-tumoral 
crosstalks with their microenvironment. Stroma modifications, such as fibroblast 
activation into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix 
(ECM) remodeling, are now recognized as critical events for cancer progression 
and as potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets. The recent appreciation of 
the key, complex and multiple roles of the ECM in cancer and of the CAF 
diversity, has revolutionized the field and raised innovative but challenging 
questions. Here, we rapidly present CAF heterogeneity in link with their 
specific ECM remodeling features observed in cancer, before developing each of 
the impacts of such ECM modifications on tumor progression (survival, 
angiogenesis, pre-metastatic niche, chemoresistance, etc.), and on patient 
prognosis. Finally, based on preclinical studies and recent results obtained 
from clinical trials, we highlight key mechanisms or proteins that are, or may 
be, used as potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets, and we report and 
discuss benefits, disappointments, or even failures, of recently reported 
stroma-targeting strategies.
