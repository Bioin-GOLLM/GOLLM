Patients with head-and-neck cancer can develop both lung metastasis and primary 
lung cancer during the course of their disease. Despite the clinical importance 
of discrimination, reliable diagnostic biomarkers are still lacking. Here, we 
have characterised a cohort of squamous cell lung (SQCLC) and head-and-neck 
(HNSCC) carcinomas by quantitative proteomics. In a training cohort, we 
quantified 4,957 proteins in 44 SQCLC and 30 HNSCC tumours. A total of 518 
proteins were found to be differentially expressed between SQCLC and HNSCC, and 
some of these were identified as genetic dependencies in either of the two 
tumour types. Using supervised machine learning, we inferred a proteomic 
signature for the classification of squamous cell carcinomas as either SQCLC or 
HNSCC, with diagnostic accuracies of 90.5% and 86.8% in cross- and independent 
validations, respectively. Furthermore, application of this signature to a 
cohort of pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas of unknown origin leads to a 
significant prognostic separation. This study not only provides a diagnostic 
proteomic signature for classification of secondary lung tumours in HNSCC 
patients, but also represents a proteomic resource for HNSCC and SQCLC.
