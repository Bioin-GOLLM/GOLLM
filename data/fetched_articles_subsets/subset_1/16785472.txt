PURPOSE: Understanding how specific genetic variants modify drug action pathways 
may provide informative blueprints for individualized chemotherapy.
METHODS: We applied a pathway-based approach to examine the impact of a 
comprehensive panel of genetic polymorphisms on clinical outcomes in 210 
esophageal cancer patients.
RESULTS: In the Cox proportional hazards model, MTHFR Glu429Ala variant 
genotypes were associated with significantly improved survival (hazard ratio 
[HR] = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89) in patients treated with fluorouracil (FU). 
The 3-year survival rates for patients with the variant genotypes and the wild 
genotypes were 65.26% and 46.43%, respectively. Joint analysis of five 
polymorphisms in three FU pathway genes showed a significant trend for reduced 
recurrence risk and longer recurrence-free survival as the number of adverse 
alleles decreased (P = .004). For patients receiving platinum drugs, the MDR1 
C3435T variant allele was associated with significantly reduced recurrence risk 
(HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.64) and improved survival (HR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23 
to 0.85). In nucleotide excision repair genes, there was a significant trend for 
a decreasing risk of death with a decreasing number of high-risk alleles (P for 
trend = .0008). In base excision repair genes, the variant alleles of XRCC1 
Arg399Gln were significantly associated with the absence of pathologic complete 
response (odds ratio = 2.75; 95% CI, 1.14 to 6.12) and poor survival (HR = 1.92; 
95% CI, 1.00 to 3.72).
CONCLUSION: Several biologically plausible associations between individual 
single nucleotide polymorphisms and clinical outcomes were found. Our data also 
strongly suggest that combined pathway-based analysis may provide valuable 
prognostic markers of clinical outcomes.
