In recent years, stem cell-related therapies have been widely applied for 
treating neurodegenerative disease. Despite their potential, stem cell tracking 
and imaging techniques for the evaluation of in vivo proof-of-concept (PoC) 
therapies have not been sufficiently represented in the research area. This 
review summarizes the recent approaches that have been used for tracking and 
imaging engrafted stem cells in vivo. Furthermore, we introduce tissue clearing 
technology that can be applied to develop three-dimensional in vivo experiments. 
Monitoring stem cell survival and migration and graft-host relationships is a 
useful strategy to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of regenerative medicine 
approaches in neurodegenerative disease.
