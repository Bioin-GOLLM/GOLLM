OBJECTIVE: The discovery of specific microRNAs (miRNA) mediates a better 
understanding of molecular mechanisms, diagnosis and prognosis of complex 
phenotypes. Synthesis of the RhD blood group involves multiple factors causing 
variation in the expression of RHD antigens. The mechanism underlying the 
extremely weak expression of RHD antigen associated with the RHD variant called 
DEL (D-elute) is incompletely understood. Down-regulation of gene expression 
through miRNA is a guide to the potential involvement of miRNAs in the DEL blood 
group. In order to determine the association of miRNAs and Rh-DEL blood donors 
with DEL variant, we investigated the expression level RHD-specific miRNA.
METHODS: Blood samples were serologically tested for RhD blood group 
determination. DNA was analysed using SSP-PCR for the Asian-type DEL allele (RHD 
1227 G>A). Bioinformatics analyses were applied for prediction of candidate 
RHD-specific miRNA. The RHD-specific miRNA expression level was quantitated 
using a real-time-qPCR approach. The miRNA expression levels of various RhD 
blood groups were compared and statistically analysed.
RESULTS: The bioinformatics tools (n = 3) for prediction of miRNA targeting on 
RHD identified miR-98 as the miRNA potentially specific for the 3' UTR of RHD. 
The relative expression levels of miR-98 among D-positive (n = 50), D-negative 
(n = 49) and DEL (n = 63) subjects showed no statistically significant 
differences (P-values = 0.58).
CONCLUSION: This is the first attempt to determine whether miR-98 is involved in 
RHD expression using computational and experimental approaches. Further 
investigations are necessary to fully characterize the miRNA genetics in DEL 
blood group regulation.
