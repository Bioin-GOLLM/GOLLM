Reversible protein biotinylation is readily affected via conjugation with a 
bromomaleimide-based reagent followed by reductive cleavage. The intermediate 
biotinylated protein constructs are stable at physiological temperature and pH 
8.0. Quantitative reversibility is elegantly delivered under mild conditions of 
using a stoichiometric amount of a bis-thiol, thus providing an approach that 
will be of general interest in chemical biology and proteomics.
