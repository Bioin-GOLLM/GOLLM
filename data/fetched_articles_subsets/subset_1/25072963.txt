The NFAT signaling pathway regulates various aspects of cellular functions; NFAT 
acts as a calcium sensor, integrating calcium signaling with other pathways 
involved in development and growth, immune response, and inflammatory response. 
The NFAT family of transcription factors regulates diverse cellular functions 
such as cell survival, proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. The 
NFAT isoforms are constitutively activated and overexpressed in several cancer 
types wherein they transactivate downstream targets that play important roles in 
cancer development and progression. Though the NFAT family has been conclusively 
proved to be pivotal in cancer progression, the different isoforms play distinct 
roles in different cellular contexts. In this review, our discussion is focused 
on the mechanisms that drive the activation of various NFAT isoforms in cancer. 
Additionally, we analyze the potential of NFAT as a valid target for cancer 
prevention and therapy.
