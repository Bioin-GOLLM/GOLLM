DNA unwinding in eukaryotic replication is performed by the Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) 
helicase. Although the CMG architecture has been elucidated, its mechanism of 
DNA unwinding and replisome interactions remain poorly understood. Here we 
report the cryoEM structure at 3.3 Å of human CMG bound to fork DNA and the 
ATP-analogue ATPγS. Eleven nucleotides of single-stranded (ss) DNA are bound 
within the C-tier of MCM2-7 AAA+ ATPase domains. All MCM subunits contact DNA, 
from MCM2 at the 5'-end to MCM5 at the 3'-end of the DNA spiral, but only MCM6, 
4, 7 and 3 make a full set of interactions. DNA binding correlates with 
nucleotide occupancy: five MCM subunits are bound to either ATPγS or ADP, 
whereas the apo MCM2-5 interface remains open. We further report the cryoEM 
structure of human CMG bound to the replisome hub AND-1 (CMGA). The AND-1 trimer 
uses one β-propeller domain of its trimerisation region to dock onto the side of 
the helicase assembly formed by Cdc45 and GINS. In the resulting CMGA 
architecture, the AND-1 trimer is closely positioned to the fork DNA while its 
CIP (Ctf4-interacting peptide)-binding helical domains remain available to 
recruit partner proteins.
