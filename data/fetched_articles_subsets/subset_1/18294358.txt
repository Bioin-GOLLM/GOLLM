Alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, one of the most common inborn errors of 
metabolism in Caucasians, is characterized by a low serum concentration of A1AT 
and a high risk of pulmonary emphysema and liver disease. The allelic frequency 
for the most common protease inhibitor (PI) Z mutation in the SERPINA1 gene is 
2-5% in Caucasians of European descent. The objective of our study was to 
estimate the PI Z mutation age using molecular analysis in Latvian and Swedish 
populations, which have the highest frequency of PI Z mutation. DNA samples of 
heterozygous and homozygous PI Z allele carriers from Latvia (n = 21) and Sweden 
(n = 65) were analysed; 113 unrelated healthy donors from Latvia were used as a 
control group. MALDI-TOF analysis was performed on all samples. Pairwise Fst was 
computed to compare the PI Z mutation ages between the two populations and 
controls. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Analysis of 
non-recombinant SNPs revealed that the PI Z mutation age was 2902 years in 
Latvia (SD 1983) and 2362 years in Sweden (SD 1614) which correlates with 
previous studies based on microsatellite analysis.
