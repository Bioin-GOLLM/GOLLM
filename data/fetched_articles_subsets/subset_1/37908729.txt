Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is an approved treatment modality, which is presently 
receiving great attention due to its limited invasiveness, high selectivity and 
limited susceptibility to drug resistance. Another related research area 
currently expanding rapidly is the development of novel theranostic agents based 
on the combination of PDT with different imaging technologies, which allows for 
both therapy and diagnosis. This combination can help to address issues of 
suboptimal biodistribution and selectivity through regional imaging, while 
therapeutic agents enable an effective and personalized therapy. In this review, 
we describe compounds, whose structures combine PDT photosensitizers with 
different imaging probes - including examples for near-infrared optical imaging, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear imaging (PET or SPECT), generating 
novel theranostic drug candidates. We have intentionally focused our attention 
on novel compounds, which have already been investigated preclinically in vivo 
in order to demonstrate the potential of such theranostic agents for clinical 
applications.
