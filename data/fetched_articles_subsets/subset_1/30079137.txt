Hepatitis B represents a global health threat because its chronic course and 
sequelae contribute to a high morbidity and mortality. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
infection can be controlled by vaccines, antiviral treatment, and by 
interrupting transmission. Rare vaccine escape mutants are serious because they 
eliminate vaccine protection. Here, we present a 74-year-old vaccinated patient 
with HBV reactivation 11 years after kidney transplantation. The patient was 
HBV-positive but HBsAg-negative prior to vaccination 6 years before 
transplantation. The reactivated virus was HBV genotype F3 with vaccine escape 
mutations G145R, P120Q, and Q129P. The patient was successfully treated with 
entecavir. The epidemiological reasons for this subgenotype, which is extremely 
rare in Western Europe, were unclear. This case illustrates that 
second-generation vaccines are not always effective in a specific group of 
patients.
