Life-threatening malignant arrhythmias in pathophysiological conditions can 
increase the mortality and morbidity of patients with cardiovascular diseases. 
Cardiac electrical activity depends on the coordinated propagation of excitatory 
stimuli and the generation of action potentials in cardiomyocytes. Action 
potential formation results from the opening and closing of ion channels. Recent 
studies have indicated that small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) 
channels play a critical role in cardiac repolarization in pathophysiological 
but not normal physiological conditions. The aim of this review is to describe 
the role of SK channels in healthy and diseased hearts, to suggest 
cardiovascular pathophysiologic targets for intervention, and to discuss studies 
of agents that target SK channels for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
