Whole exome sequencing (WES) is increasingly being used for diagnosis without 
adequate information on predictive characteristics of reportable variants 
typically found on any given individual and correlation with clinical phenotype. 
In this study, we performed WES on 89 deceased individuals (mean age at death 74 
years, range 28-93) from the Mayo Clinic Biobank. Significant clinical diagnoses 
were abstracted from electronic medical record via chart review. Variants 
[Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) and insertion/deletion] were filtered based on 
quality (accuracy >99%, read-depth >20, alternate-allele read-depth >5, 
minor-allele-frequency <0.1) and available HGMD/OMIM phenotype information. 
Variants were defined as Tier-1 (nonsense, splice or frame-shifting) and Tier-2 
(missense, predicted-damaging) and evaluated in 56 ACMG-reportable genes, 57 
cancer-predisposition genes, along with examining overall genotype-phenotype 
correlations. Following variant filtering, 7046 total variants were identified 
(~79/person, 644 Tier-1, 6402 Tier-2), 161 among 56 ACMG-reportable genes 
(~1.8/person, 13 Tier-1, 148 Tier-2), and 115 among 57 cancer-predisposition 
genes (~1.3/person, 3 Tier-1, 112 Tier-2). The number of variants across 57 
cancer-predisposition genes did not differentiate individuals with/without 
invasive cancer history (P > 0.19). Evaluating genotype-phenotype correlations 
across the exome, 202(3%) of 7046 filtered variants had some evidence for 
phenotypic correlation in medical records, while 3710(53%) variants had no 
phenotypic correlation. The phenotype associated with the remaining 44% could 
not be assessed from a typical medical record review. These data highlight 
significant continued challenges in the ability to extract medically meaningful 
predictive results from WES.
