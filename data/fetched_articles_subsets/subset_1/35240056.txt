The impact of copy-number variations (CNVs) on complex human traits remains 
understudied. We called CNVs in 331,522 UK Biobank participants and performed 
genome-wide association studies (GWASs) between the copy number of CNV-proxy 
probes and 57 continuous traits, revealing 131 signals spanning 47 phenotypes. 
Our analysis recapitulated well-known associations (e.g., 1q21 and height), 
revealed the pleiotropy of recurrent CNVs (e.g., 26 and 16 traits for 
16p11.2-BP4-BP5 and 22q11.21, respectively), and suggested gene functionalities 
(e.g., MARF1 in female reproduction). Forty-eight CNV signals (38%) overlapped 
with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-GWASs signals for the same trait. For 
instance, deletion of PDZK1, which encodes a urate transporter scaffold protein, 
decreased serum urate levels, while deletion of RHD, which encodes the Rhesus 
blood group D antigen, associated with hematological traits. Other signals 
overlapped Mendelian disorder regions, suggesting variable expressivity and 
broad impact of these loci, as illustrated by signals mapping to Rotor syndrome 
(SLCO1B1/3), renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (HNF1B), or Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
(PMP22) loci. Total CNV burden negatively impacted 35 traits, leading to 
increased adiposity, liver/kidney damage, and decreased intelligence and 
physical capacity. Thirty traits remained burden associated after correcting for 
CNV-GWAS signals, pointing to a polygenic CNV architecture. The burden 
negatively correlated with socio-economic indicators, parental lifespan, and age 
(survivorship proxy), suggesting a contribution to decreased longevity. 
Together, our results showcase how studying CNVs can expand biological insights, 
emphasizing the critical role of this mutational class in shaping human traits 
and arguing in favor of a continuum between Mendelian and complex diseases.
