A fast circadian clock at high temperatures is a conserved feature across 
Arabidopsis accessions and likely to be important for vegetative yield.

The circadian clock is an endogenous 24 h oscillator regulating many critical 
biological processes in plants. One of the key characteristics of the circadian 
clock is that it is buffered against temperature, maintaining an approximately 
24 h rhythm over a broad physiological temperature range. Here, we tested 
temperature-buffering capacity of the circadian clock across a number of 
Arabidopsis accessions using several circadian clock reporters: leaf movement, 
CCA1:LUC and LHY:LUC. We found that leaf movement was the best temperature 
buffered circadian output. On the other hand, when temperature increases, 
circadian rhythms of CCA1 and LHY transcription shorten considerably across all 
accessions, indicating that the clock driving expression of CCA1 and LHY is not 
perfectly buffered. This feature might be crucial to plants growing in a 
constantly changing environment, and here, we provide insight into the 
importance of period shortening to plant growth performance and the benefits of 
a flexible clock.
