Genetic polymorphism of human plasma apolipoprotein A-IV has been detected by 
isoelectric focusing techniques followed by immunoblotting. The molecular basis 
for this apoA-IV polymorphism has been elucidated. Analysis of the protein 
coding sequences of the apoA-IV alleles 1 and 2 revealed a single G to T 
substitution in the apoA-IV-2 allele. The point mutation, occurring in a region 
highly conserved among the mouse, rat, and human A-IV apolipoproteins, converts 
the glutamine at position 360 of the mature protein to a histidine. This amino 
acid substitution adds one positive charge unit to the apoA-IV-1 isoprotein (pI 
4.97) thus creating the more basic apoA-IV-2 isoprotein (pI 5.02). Computer 
analysis of the apoA-IV-2 allele revealed that the single G to T substitution 
results in the loss of a BbvI and a Fnu4HI restriction enzyme site and in the 
formation of a new restriction site for the enzyme SfaNI. Protein primary and 
secondary structure predictions were largely unaffected by this amino acid 
exchange. These results on the structure of the apoA-IV-1 and apoA-IV-2 alleles 
suggest that the three other rare isoproteins (apoA-IV-0, apoA-IV-3, and 
apoA-IV-4) are also due to nucleotide and subsequent amino acid substitutions in 
the apoA-IV sequence.
