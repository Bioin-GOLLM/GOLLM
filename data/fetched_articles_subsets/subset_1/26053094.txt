Neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer with highly heterogeneous biology and clinical 
behavior, is characterized by genomic aberrations including amplification of 
MYCN. Hemizygous deletion of chromosome 11q is a well-established, independent 
marker of poor prognosis. While 11q22-q23 is the most frequently deleted region, 
the neuroblastoma tumor suppressor in this region remains to be identified. 
Chromosome bands 11q22-q23 contain ATM, a cell cycle checkpoint kinase and tumor 
suppressor playing a pivotal role in the DNA damage response. Here, we report 
that haploinsufficiency of ATM in neuroblastoma correlates with lower ATM 
expression, event-free survival, and overall survival. ATM loss occurs in high 
stage neuroblastoma without MYCN amplification. In SK-N-SH, CLB-Ga and GI-ME-N 
human neuroblastoma cells, stable ATM silencing promotes neuroblastoma 
progression in soft agar assays, and in subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. 
This effect is dependent on the extent of ATM silencing and does not appear to 
involve MYCN. Our findings identify ATM as a potential haploinsufficient 
neuroblastoma tumor suppressor, whose inactivation mirrors the increased 
aggressiveness associated with 11q deletion in neuroblastoma.
