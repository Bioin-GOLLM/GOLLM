Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are latent 
transcription factors that mediate a wide range of actions induced by cytokines, 
interferons, and growth factors. We now report the development of thymic T cell 
lymphoblastic lymphomas in transgenic mice in which Stat5a or Stat5b is 
overexpressed within the lymphoid compartment. The rate of lymphoma induction 
was markedly enhanced by immunization or by the introduction of TCR transgenes. 
Remarkably, the Stat5 transgene potently induced development of CD8+ T cells, 
even in mice expressing a class II-restricted TCR transgene, with resulting CD8+ 
T cell lymphomas. These data demonstrate the oncogenic potential of dysregulated 
expression of a STAT protein that is not constitutively activated, and that TCR 
stimulation can contribute to this process.
