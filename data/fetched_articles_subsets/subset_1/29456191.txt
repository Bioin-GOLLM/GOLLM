BACKGROUND: A dose of 30 mg/kg of azithromycin is recommended for treatment of 
yaws, a disease targeted for global eradication. Treatment with 20 mg/kg of 
azithromycin is recommended for the elimination of trachoma as a public health 
problem. In some settings, these diseases are co-endemic. We aimed to determine 
the efficacy of 20 mg/kg of azithromycin compared with 30 mg/kg azithromycin for 
the treatment of active and latent yaws.
METHODS: We did a non-inferiority, open-label, randomised controlled trial in 
children aged 6-15 years who were recruited from schools in Ghana and schools 
and the community in Papua New Guinea. Participants were enrolled based on the 
presence of a clinical lesion that was consistent with infectious primary or 
secondary yaws and a positive rapid diagnostic test for treponemal and 
non-treponemal antibodies. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 
either standard-dose (30 mg/kg) or low-dose (20 mg/kg) azithromycin by a 
computer-generated random number sequence. Health-care workers assessing 
clinical outcomes in the field were not blinded to the patient's treatment, but 
investigators involved in statistical or laboratory analyses and the 
participants were blinded to treatment group. We followed up participants at 4 
weeks and 6 months. The primary outcome was cure at 6 months, defined as lesion 
healing at 4 weeks in patients with active yaws and at least a four-fold 
decrease in rapid plasma reagin titre from baseline to 6 months in patients with 
active and latent yaws. Active yaws was defined as a skin lesion that was 
positive for Treponema pallidum ssp pertenue in PCR testing. We used a 
non-inferiority margin of 10%. This trial was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02344628.
FINDINGS: Between June 12, 2015, and July 2, 2016, 583 (65·1%) of 895 children 
screened were enrolled; 292 patients were assigned a low dose of azithromycin 
and 291 patients were assigned a standard dose of azithromycin. 191 participants 
had active yaws and 392 had presumed latent yaws. Complete follow-up to 6 months 
was available for 157 (82·2%) of 191 patients with active yaws. In cases of 
active yaws, cure was achieved in 61 (80·3%) of 76 patients in the low-dose 
group and in 68 (84·0%) of 81 patients in the standard-dose group (difference 
3·7%; 95% CI -8·4 to 15·7%; this result did not meet the non-inferiority 
criterion). There were no serious adverse events reported in response to 
treatment in either group. The most commonly reported adverse event at 4 weeks 
was gastrointestinal upset, with eight (2·7%) participants in each group 
reporting this symptom.
INTERPRETATION: In this study, low-dose azithromycin did not meet the 
prespecified non-inferiority margin compared with standard-dose azithromycin in 
achieving clinical and serological cure in PCR-confirmed active yaws. Only a 
single participant (with presumed latent yaws) had definitive serological 
failure. This work suggests that 20 mg/kg of azithromycin is probably effective 
against yaws, but further data are needed.
