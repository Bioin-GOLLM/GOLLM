BACKGROUND: Obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and diabetes have been reported as 
frequent complications observed in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH) in Western countries. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
genetic predisposition on NASH pathogenesis in the Japanese population.
METHODS: Genotypes of two previously described functional 
polymorphisms-beta3-adrenergic receptor 190 T/A polymorphism, which results in 
Trp64Arg (W64R) amino acid replacement, and interleukin-1beta-511 T/C 
polymorphism in the promoter sequence-were determined in 63 Japanese NASH 
patients and 100 healthy volunteers using polymerase chain reaction and 
restriction fragment length polymorphism.
RESULTS: beta3-adrenergic receptor R allele frequency and the R/- (W/R and R/R) 
genotype frequency were significantly higher in NASH patients than those in 
control subjects. Interleukin-1beta-511 T allele frequency and the T/T genotype 
frequency were significantly higher in NASH patients than those in control 
subjects. Obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperinsulinemia were associated 
with NASH patients with the R/- genotype, whereas an increase in fasting plasma 
glucose level and a decrease in insulinogenic index were associated with NASH 
patients with the W/W genotype.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the contribution of obesity, glucose 
intolerance, and hypertriglyceridemia to NASH development in the Japanese 
population. In addition to these factors, genetic predispositions to obesity and 
inflammation in the Japanese population were shown to contribute much to the 
development of NASH.
