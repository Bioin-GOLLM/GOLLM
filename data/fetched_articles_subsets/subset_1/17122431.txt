BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous evidence from MRI and acetylcholinesterase 
histochemistry suggests cholinergic fibers are affected in cerebral autosomal 
dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy 
(CADASIL).
METHODS: As a measure of cholinergic function, we assessed choline 
acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities in the frontal and temporal neocortices and 
the immunocytochemical distribution of ChAT and p75 neurotrophin receptor 
(P75(NTR)) by in vitro imaging in the nucleus basalis of Meynert of CADASIL 
subjects.
RESULTS: ChAT activities were significantly reduced by 60% to 70% in frontal and 
temporal cortices of CADASIL cases, as were ChAT and P75(NTR) immunoreactivities 
in the nucleus basalis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest cholinergic neuronal impairment in CADASIL and 
implicate cholinomimetic therapy for subcortical vascular dementias.
