G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are key players 
in inhibitory neurotransmission in heart and brain. We conducted molecular 
dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of a selectivity filter (SF) 
mutation, G154S, on GIRK2 structure and function. We observe mutation-induced 
loss of selectivity, changes in ion occupancy and altered filter geometry. 
Unexpectedly, we reveal aberrant SF dynamics in the mutant to be correlated with 
motions in the binding site of the channel activator Gβγ. This coupling is 
corroborated by electrophysiological experiments, revealing that GIRK2wt 
activation by Gβγ reduces the affinity of Ba2+ block. We further present a 
functional characterization of the human GIRK2G154S mutant validating our 
computational findings. This study identifies an allosteric connection between 
the SF and a crucial activator binding site. This allosteric gating mechanism 
may also apply to other potassium channels that are modulated by accessory 
proteins.
