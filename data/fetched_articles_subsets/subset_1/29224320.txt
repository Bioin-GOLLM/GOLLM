Objective: To compare the cytogenetic response detected by conventional banding 
analysis (CBA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and to explore the 
correlation between the cytogenetic and molecular response in chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML) patients during tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. 
Methods: CBA, FISH and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase 
chain reaction (RQ-PCR) methods were performed to detect the cytogenetic and 
molecular response simultaneously in 504 bone marrow samples from 367 CML 
patients who received TKI treatment. Results: Among 504 samples, 344 were 
detected to reach complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by CBA, while 297 samples 
reached CCyR by FISH which were considered to carry BCR-ABL positive cells<1%. 
When the results of CBA, FISH and RQ-PCR were compared in 493 samples at the 
same time, it showed that in 337 samples with CBA-CCyR, 273 (81.0%) reached 
FISH-CCyR and 289 (85.8%) were BCR-ABL(IS) (International Scale, IS) ≤1% by 
RQ-PCR, compared to 9.0 (261/290) were BCR-ABL(IS) ≤1% among 290 samples with 
FISH-CCyR. There was no significant difference in the median value of 
BCR-ABL(IS) between samples in CBA-CCyR and FISH-CCyR (0.21% vs 0.13%, z=-1.875, 
P=0.061) . Furthermore, when the samples were divided into three groups 
according to BCR-ABL positive cells (0,>0~<1%, 1%~5%) by FISH, the statistical 
difference was observed, the proportion of samples with BCR-ABL(IS) ≤1% in the 
three groups were 94.1%, 57.6% and 27.7% respectively (χ(2)=43.499, P<0.001; 
χ(2)=9.734, P=0.003) , while the median value of BCR-ABL(IS) were 0.10%, 0.64% 
and 1.80% respectively (z=-5.864, P<0.001; z=-4.787, P<0.001) . Conclusion: FISH 
results were in good concordance with CBA in identify samples in CCyR, FISH was 
more sensitive and had better correlation with RQ-PCR results than CBA, but how 
to define FISH-CCyR need further study.

Publisher: 目的： 
比较染色体核型分析和荧光原位杂交（FISH）两种方法检测酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（TKI）治疗慢性髓性白血病（CML）细胞遗传学反应的差异，及其与分子学反应的相关性。 
方法： 
同期采集367例CML患者504份骨髓样本，以传统显带分析（CBA）法和FISH法进行染色体分析，以实时荧光定量PCR（RQ-PCR）法检测BCR-ABL转录本水平。 
结果： 
504份样本中，采用CBA法检测，344份达完全细胞遗传学反应（CCyR）；采用FISH法检测，297份达CCyR（BCR-ABL(+)细胞<1%）。同期比较493份标本的CBA、FISH和RQ-PCR结果，在337份CBA-CCyR的样本中，273份（81.0%）达FISHCCyR，289份（85.8%）分子学反应BCR-ABL(IS) 
≤ 1%；290份FISH-CCyR样本中，261份（90.0%）分子学反应BCR-ABL(IS) ≤ 
1%。CBA-CCyR和FISH-CCyR两组样本BCR-ABL(IS)中位数分别为0.21%和0.13%，差异无统计学意义（z=-1.875, 
P=0.061）。将FISH结果按BCR-ABL(+)细胞比例分成0、>0~<1%、1%~5%三组，三组样本获分子学反应BCR-ABL(IS) ≤ 
1%的比例分别为94.1%、57.6%、27.7%，差异有统计学意义（χ(2)=43.499, P<0.001; 
χ(2)=9.734，P=0.003）；三组BCR-ABL(IS)中位数分别为0.10%、0.64%、1.80%，差异有统计学意义（z=-5.864, 
P<0.001; z=-4.787, P<0.001）。 结论： 
CBA和FISH两种方法对于CCyR的监测具有较好的一致性，FISH比CBA法敏感性更高，FISH结果与分子学反应有更好的一致性，但如何定义FISH-CCyR仍需大宗病例随访研究。.
