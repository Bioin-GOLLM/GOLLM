Charcot arthropathy is an insidious condition affecting the lower limbs of 
diabetic patients. It is a complication of diabetic neuropathy resulting from 
subsequent Wallerian degeneration of the nerves. This complication may 
eventually lead to limb amputation and a poor patient prognosis if not diagnosed 
and treated successfully. Herein, we report the case of a 73-year-old female who 
presented with rapidly progressive bilateral Charcot foot over a 5-week period, 
necessitating an exostectomy on the mid foot, specifically on the cuboid bone 
and the navicular cuneiform joint. Her presentation with rapidly progressing 
foot ulcers on the plantar aspect prompted initial treatment based on 
osteomyelitis. The report will therefore serve as a useful guide on how to 
properly treat Charcot foot, which may present in an atypical manner.
