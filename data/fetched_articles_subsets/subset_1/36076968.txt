Elucidation of the factors responsible for hepatitis B virus (HBV) is extremely 
important in order to understand the viral life cycle and pathogenesis, and 
thereby explore potential anti-HBV drugs. The recent determination that sodium 
taurocholate co-transporting peptide (NTCP) is an essential molecule for the HBV 
entry into cells led to the development of an HBV infection system in vitro 
using a human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line expressing NTCP; however, 
the precise mechanism of HBV entry is still largely unknown, and thus it may be 
necessary to elucidate all the molecules involved. Here, we identified ATP5B as 
another essential factor for HBV entry. ATP5B was expressed on the cell surface 
of the HCC cell lines and bound with myristoylated but not with 
non-myristoylated preS1 2-47, which supported the notion that ATP5B is involved 
in the HBV entry process. Knockdown of ATP5B in NTCP-expressing HepG2 cells, 
which allowed HBV infection, reduced HBV infectivity with less cccDNA formation. 
Taken together, these results strongly suggested that ATP5B is an essential 
factor for HBV entry into the cells.
