Separate single nucleotide mutations have been identified in two unrelated 
homozygous type I protein C deficient individuals suffering from thrombophilia. 
Each mutation, initially established by direct DNA sequencing of polymerase 
chain reaction amplification products, results in an amino acid substitution. 
The first mutation (PCClamart) results in an Ala136 to Pro substitution in the 
protein's second epidermal growth factor-like domain. The second mutation 
(PCMÃ¼nchen) results in an Arg286 to His substitution in the serine protease 
domain. Comparison of the location of these two mutations and the relative 
conservation of the two regions in homologous vitamin K-dependent plasma 
proteins is consistent with the difference in severity of protein C deficiency 
and disease in the two individuals. Both mutations result in the abolition of a 
naturally occurring restriction endonuclease site, thereby allowing independent 
confirmation of the mutations and rapid and unambiguous genetic analysis of 
protein C deficiency in family members. In both families, the genetic analysis 
has proven useful in cases where an assignment of the protein C status based 
upon clinical laboratory measurements was either ambiguous or incorrect.
