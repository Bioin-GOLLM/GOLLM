An important class of non-heme dioxygenases contains a conserved Fe binding site 
that consists of a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad. Results from structural 
biology show that, in the resting state, these proteins are six-coordinate with 
aqua ligands occupying the remaining three coordination sites. We have utilized 
biotin-streptavidin (Sav) technology to design new artificial Fe proteins (ArMs) 
that have many of the same structural features found within active sites of 
these non-heme dioxygenases. An Sav variant was isolated that contains the S112E 
mutation, which installed a carboxylate side chain in the appropriate position 
to bind to a synthetic FeII complex confined within Sav. Structural studies 
using X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods revealed a facial triad binding site that 
is composed of two N donors from the biotinylated ligand and the monodentate 
coordination of the carboxylate from S112E. Two aqua ligands complete the 
primary coordination sphere of the FeII center with both involved in hydrogen 
bond networks within Sav. The corresponding FeIII protein was also prepared and 
structurally characterized to show a six-coordinate complex with two exogenous 
acetato ligands. The FeIII protein was further shown to bind an exogenous azido 
ligand through replacement of one acetato ligand. Spectroscopic studies of the 
ArMs in solution support the results found by XRD.
