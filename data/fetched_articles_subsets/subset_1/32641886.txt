A 5-year-old boy with the history of intractable seizure for the past 2 years 
was transferred to the emergency room for cardiopulmonary resuscitation because 
of the prolonged seizure and profound cyanosis. He was intubated and 
resuscitated by cardioversion for a bizarre shape ventricular tachycardia (VT). 
After noxious stimulation, he showed multiple polymorphic ventricular premature 
beats that were followed by a bidirectional VT in favor of catecholaminergic 
polymorphic VT. The genetic assessment was positive for CASQ2 mutation. In the 
follow-up, the arrhythmia was controlled by nadolol, however with a prominent 
neurological sequela.
