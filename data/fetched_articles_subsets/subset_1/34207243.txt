Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors. Although 
constituting only 1% of all human malignancies, STSs represent the second most 
common type of solid tumors in children and adolescents and comprise an 
important group of secondary malignancies. Over 100 histologic subtypes have 
been characterized to date (occurring predominantly in the trunk, extremity, and 
retroperitoneum), and many more are being discovered due to molecular profiling. 
STS mortality remains high, despite adjuvant chemotherapy. New prognostic 
stratification markers are needed to help identify patients at risk of 
recurrence and possibly apply more intensive or novel treatments. Recent 
scientific advancements have enabled a more precise molecular characterization 
of sarcoma subtypes and revealed novel therapeutic targets and 
prognostic/predictive biomarkers. This review aims at providing a comprehensive 
overview of the most relevant cellular, molecular and metabolic biomarkers for 
STS, and highlight advances in STS-related biomarker research.
