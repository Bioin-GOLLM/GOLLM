The development of ischemic stroke is associated with advanced age. Telomere 
length, as a marker of biological aging, has been reported to influence the risk 
of several age-related diseases, including ischemic stroke. Recent studies have 
identified the genetic variant within ACYP2 and TSPYL6 associated with shorter 
telomere length. The objective of this study is to investigate the putative 
association of ischemic stroke with common polymorphisms in ACYP2 and TSPYL6 
genes in a Chinese Han population. We found that the risk alleles of six single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs11125529, rs12615793, rs843711, 
rs11896604, and rs843706 within both ACYP2 and TSPYL6, and rs17045754 in ACYP2 
gene, were related with increased risk of ischemic stroke according to both 
allelic and genotype association analyses. The significant correlations between 
ACYP2 and TSPYL6 SNPs and ischemic stroke risk were also observed in dominant, 
recessive, and additive models, respectively. Two blocks in high linkage 
disequilibrium were identified in this study, and two haplotypes were associated 
with higher ischemic stroke susceptibility. In conclusion, the genetic 
polymorphisms of ACYP2 and TSPYL6 are associated with increased risk of 
developing ischemic stroke. Further studies with larger sample sizes are 
required to validate our findings.
