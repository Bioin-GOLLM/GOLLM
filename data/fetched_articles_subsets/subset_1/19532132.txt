OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is increasingly recognized as a form 
of chronic pancreatitis. Systematic evaluation and management of AIP in the 
United States is reported only from one center. Our aim was to review the 
evaluation and management of AIP at a large tertiary center.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed information on demographics, clinical 
presentation, laboratory and imaging findings, extrapancreatic involvement, 
treatment response, and recurrence in 26 patients with AIP treated at the 
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from 1998 to 2007.
RESULTS: The median age at presentation was 62.5 years (range: 23-86), 65% were 
men, and 88% were Caucasians. The most common presentation included new-onset 
mild abdominal pain (65%), jaundice (62%), and weight loss (42%). Pancreatic 
mass, enlargement, or prominence on imaging was present in 85% of the patients. 
Serum IgG4 (immunoglobulin-4) was elevated (>140 mg/dl) in 44% (8/18) at 
presentation. The most common extrapancreatic finding was 
extrapancreatic/intrahepatic biliary strictures (35%). Peri-pancreatic vascular 
complications were noted in 23% of the patients. Six patients underwent partial 
or complete pancreatectomy. Partial or complete response was observed for 
initial steroid treatment in 19 patients and for methotrexate in 1 patient. 
Recurrences were common, especially in patients with extrapancreatic 
manifestations, and usually responded to a combination of steroids and 
azathioprine. Any one of the commonly used diagnostic criteria (Mayo Clinic's 
HISORt criteria, the Japanese Pancreas Society criteria, Korean diagnostic 
criteria) was fulfilled in 85% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: In this second major US series, we confirm several findings 
previously reported in AIP. Our study highlights the presence of vascular 
complications in a subset of patients with AIP. The current diagnostic criteria 
may not identify all AIP patients.
