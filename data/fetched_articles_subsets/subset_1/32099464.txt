Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NEO-HT) is a possible treatment option for breast 
cancer (BC) patient with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and HER2 negative 
(HER2-) disease. The absence of solid data on the type of drugs to be used and 
duration of treatment as well as lack of clear evidence of effectiveness of 
NEO-HT compared to chemotherapy (CT) reserve its use for patients with old age 
or frail conditions. However, the low pathologic complete response rate (pCR) 
obtained with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors (AIs) alone does not make NEO-HT 
as a suitable option for the neoadjuvant treatment of HR+ HER2-. The use of the 
cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6) inhibitors palbociclib, ribociclib and 
abemaciclib of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and 
of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor taselisib together with 
endocrine therapy (ET) has become a standard in advanced breast cancer, showing 
clinical effectiveness and significantly prolonging median progression-free 
survival compared to ET only. In the early phase disease, the use of ET together 
with CDK 4/6, mTOR and PI3K inhibitors is still investigational. Data from 
recent studies are promising even though less impressive than in metastatic 
setting. In this context, the use of genomic-transcriptomic tools (such as 
ONCOTYPE, PAM50) and the identification of novel biomarkers (ESR1, PI3Kca, 
PDGF-R) on tissue or with liquid biopsy could help to select patient prone to 
respond to endocrine-combined therapy and able to achieve pCR. With our review, 
we aimed at evaluating the current state of the art in the treatment of locally 
advanced breast cancer with NEO-HT.
