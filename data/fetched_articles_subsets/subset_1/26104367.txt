Proteasomes are ATP-dependent, barrel-shaped proteases found in all three 
domains of life. In eukaryotes, proteins are typically targeted for degradation 
by posttranslational modification with the small protein ubiquitin. In 2008, the 
first bacterial protein modifier, Pup (prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein), was 
identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Functionally analogous to ubiquitin, 
conjugation with Pup serves as a signal for degradation by the mycobacterial 
proteasome. Proteolysis-dependent and -independent functions of the M. 
tuberculosis proteasome are essential for virulence of this successful pathogen. 
In this article we describe the discovery of the proteasome as a key player in 
tuberculosis pathogenesis and the biology and biochemistry of the Pup-proteasome 
system.
