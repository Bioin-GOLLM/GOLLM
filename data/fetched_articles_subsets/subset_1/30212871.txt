BACKGROUND: Interleukin-10 (IL10)/interleukin-10 receptor (IL10R) deficiency is 
a rare disease with life-threatening infantile-onset colitis. We sought to 
accurately phenotype this disorder based on a large cohort of patients with a 
proven defect of IL10 signaling and to clarify the effects of allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
METHODS: We analyzed the phenotypes of our 61 patients and reviewed 78 other 
previously reported cases with identified mutations in the genes encoding IL10 
or IL10R. We also compared the clinical features of patients with interleukin-10 
receptor B (IL10RB), interleukin-10 receptor A (IL10RA), and IL10 mutations. The 
therapeutic effects of allogeneic HSCT were evaluated.
RESULTS: We found that the disease onset time was extremely early: 70.3% within 
30 days postnatal and 94.9% within the first 6 months of life. In addition, 
94.2% of patients typically presented with perianal lesions. Oral ulcers and 
skin rash were common extra-intestinal manifestations (33.8% and 51.8%, 
respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in disease 
onset time, perianal lesion involvement, or mortality rate among patients with 
IL10RB, IL10RA, or IL10 deficiency. However, the surgery rate was higher in 
patients with IL10RB mutations than in those with IL10 or IL10RA mutations (P < 
0.05). Compared with those with IL10RA deficiency, a higher percentage (32%, 9 
of 28) of patients with IL10RB mutations developed B-cell lymphoma (P < 0.01). 
Compared with other regions, a higher percentage (98.7%) of IL10RA mutations was 
detected among patients in East Asia countries (P < 0.01), with hot-spot 
mutation sites of c.C301T and c.G537A. Allogeneic HSCT is efficacious but has a 
high mortality rate (17.5%, 7 of 40).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study expands the current knowledge on the genotype-correlated 
phenotypes with a defect of IL10 signaling. B-cell lymphoma was more frequent 
than would be expected in patients with IL10RB mutations. There may be a unique 
genetic architecture among Eastern Asia compared with other populations. 
Although allogeneic HSCT represents a causal therapeutic approach for IL10-and 
IL10R-deficient patients, a word of caution is warranted.
