Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is characterized by the accumulation of 
lipoprotein thrombi within glomerular capillaries. This rare disorder is 
associated with various types of mutations in the apolipoprotein E gene (apoE). 
Herein, we present a case of LPG with a combination of apoE Chicago (Arg147Pro) 
and apoE (Glu3Lys) mutations. A 51-year-old Japanese woman presented with severe 
(3+) proteinuria. The initial renal biopsy showed glomerular capillary dilation 
and occlusion with lipid granules, a specific characteristic of LPG. Phenotype, 
genotype, and apoE DNA sequence analyses detected 2 mutations as described above 
within the same allele. Although both mutations had already been reported in 1 
case of LPG each, this is the first time that the combination of the 2 mutations 
was identified in the same case. Familial analysis detected the same mutations 
in the patient's mother. However, she has not suffered LPG thus far. In 
addition, a re-analysis of the previous LPG case with apoE (Glu3Lys) also 
identified the apoE Chicago mutation, as was observed in our case. Treatment 
with fenofibrate and irbesartan was initiated, and urinary protein excretion 
ceased within 1 year; recurrence was not observed after an additional 2 years of 
follow-up. A second biopsy after 2 years showed great improvement, with 
lipoprotein thrombi identified only in 2 of 18 glomeruli.
