Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) was first described over a century 
ago. Since then, we have learnt much about its clinical manifestations, surgical 
and non-surgical treatment, microscopic appearance and pathogenesis. Over the 
past decade, significant advances have been made with respect to our 
understanding of FECD genetics. This progress now enables us to appreciate that 
FECD in fact describes multiple entities with distinct underlying genetic 
causes. For example, an early-onset and rare form of the disease has been 
attributed to missense mutations in the COL8A2 gene, whereas the vast majority 
of late-onset cases can be attributed to a non-coding repeat expansion within 
the TCF4 gene.FECD is one of the most common indications for corneal 
transplantation. In recent years, attention has turned to alternative treatment 
techniques that do not depend on donor tissue supply. The design and development 
of these non-surgical treatment approaches have benefited from increased 
knowledge of pathogenesis.This review will cover our current knowledge about the 
histology and genetics of FECD, and how combining these interdisciplinary 
approaches might may improve diagnostic accuracy and aid the development of 
therapeutics for this common and visually disabling disease.
