BACKGROUND: Multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) is 
one kind of severe asthenozoospermia, which is caused by dysplastic development 
of sperm flagella. In our study, we sought to investigate the novel gene 
mutations leading to severe asthenozoospermia and MMAF.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The patient's spermatozoa were tested by Papanicolaou 
staining and transmission electron microscopy. Whole exome sequencing was 
performed on the patient with severe asthenozoospermia and MMAF. Sanger 
sequencing verified the mutations in the family. The expression of DNAH17 was 
detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot.
RESULTS: Spermatozoa sample from the patient showed severe asthenozoospermia and 
MMAF. We detected biallelic mutations (c.C4445T, p.A1482V and c.C6857T, and 
p.S2286L) in DNAH17 (MIM:610063). The protein expression of DNAH17 was almost 
undetectable in spermatozoa from the patient with the biallelic mutations.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that DNAH17 may be involved in severe 
asthenozoospermia and MMAF.
