BACKGROUND: People with diabetes are at a heightened risk of cardiovascular 
disease compared with the general population. To our knowledge, randomized 
controlled trials investigating the effect of improving dietary quality on 
carotid intima media thickness, a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and 
predictor of cardiovascular disease, have not been conducted in populations with 
diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether increasing fruit (+1 serving; 150 g/d), 
vegetable (+2 servings; 150 g/d), and dairy (+1 serving; 200-250 g/d) intakes 
slows 12-mo common carotid artery intima media thickness (CCA IMT) progression, 
compared with a control group continuing to consume their usual diet, in people 
with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
DESIGN: A 12-mo randomized controlled trial was conducted. The primary outcome 
was mean CCA IMT, measured at baseline and 12 mo, with B-mode ultrasound. 
Participants in the intervention group received counseling from a dietitian at 
baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 9 mo, and compliance was measured with a 
food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, 3 mo, and 12 mo. The control group 
continued consuming their usual diet.
RESULTS: In total, 118 participants completed the study. Vegetable (46 g/d; 95% 
CI: 14, 77 g/d; P < 0.001) and fruit (179 g/d; 95% CI: 119, 239 g/d; P < 0.001) 
intakes were increased at 3 mo in the intervention group compared with the 
control group. This increase was not maintained at 12 mo, but intake increased 
overall in the cohort (fruit, 48 g/d; vegetables, 14 g/d). An increase in dairy 
consumption was not achieved, but yogurt intake was higher in the intervention 
group at 3 mo (38 g; 95% CI: 12, 65 g; P < 0.001); this was not maintained at 12 
mo. At 12 mo, CCA IMT regressed (mean ± SD: -0.01 ± 0.04 mm; P < 0.001), with a 
greater effect in the treatment group (mean ± SD: -0.02 ± 0.04 mm compared with 
-0.004 ± 0.04 mm; P = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: Improving dietary quality in people with well-controlled type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes may slow CCA IMT progression. This trial was registered at
