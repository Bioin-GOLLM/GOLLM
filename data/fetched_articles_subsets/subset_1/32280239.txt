PURPOSE: The accumulation of progerin (PG) in patients is responsible for the 
pathogenesis of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) because it triggers 
accelerated aging of cells. However, there are few studies on the effects of 
progerin on tumor cells. Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant cancers 
with high global morbidity and mortality rates; non-small cell lung cancer 
accounts for the majority of cases. The purpose of this study was to determine 
the effects of progerin on A549 cell proliferation, cell cycle, invasion, 
migration, sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, senescence and apoptosis with a 
goal of exploring new ideas for lung cancer treatment.
METHODS: A549 cells overexpressing progerin (A549-PG) and a corresponding blank 
control (A549-GFP) were constructed by lentiviral infection. A nuclear staining 
assay was utilized to detect abnormal nuclear morphology. The proliferation, 
cell cycle, colony formation, invasion and migration abilities of A549-PG were 
compared with those of A549-GFP via EdU assays, flow cytometry, colony formation 
experiments, and Matrigel invasion and migration assays, respectively. SA-β-gal 
staining was used to measure senescence in cells.
RESULTS: The expression of progerin was significantly higher in A549-PG than 
A549-GFP. About 20% of A549-PG possessed abnormal nuclei. Overexpression of 
progerin in A549 cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and 
associated proteins (CDK4, pRB, ANLN, MMP7 and MMP9) were downregulated. DNA 
damage repair was also impaired. Progerin did not cause cells to senesce, and 
there was no difference in apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: A549-PG generated some cellular changes, including the nuclear 
skeleton, the cell cycle, DNA damage repair, and migration and invasion 
abilities. Our data indicate that progerin could cause an imbalance in the 
steady state in A549 cells and increase their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic 
drugs.
