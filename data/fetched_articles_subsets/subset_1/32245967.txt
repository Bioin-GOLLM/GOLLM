Pyrazinamide is a sterilizing first-line tuberculosis drug. Genetic, metabolomic 
and biophysical analyses previously demonstrated that pyrazinoic acid, the 
bioactive form of the prodrug pyrazinamide (PZA), interrupts biosynthesis of 
coenzyme A in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by binding to aspartate decarboxylase 
PanD. While most drugs act by inhibiting protein function upon target binding, 
we find here that pyrazinoic acid is only a weak enzyme inhibitor. We show that 
binding of pyrazinoic acid to PanD triggers degradation of the protein by the 
caseinolytic protease ClpC1-ClpP. Thus, the old tuberculosis drug pyrazinamide 
exerts antibacterial activity by acting as a target degrader, a mechanism of 
action that has recently emerged as a successful strategy in drug discovery 
across disease indications. Our findings provide the basis for the rational 
discovery of next generation PZA.
