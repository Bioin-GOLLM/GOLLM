Germline mutations in five autosomal genes involved in interleukin 
(IL)-12-dependent, interferon (IFN)-gamma-mediated immunity cause Mendelian 
susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD). The molecular basis of X-linked 
recessive (XR)-MSMD remains unknown. We report here mutations in the leucine 
zipper (LZ) domain of the NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) gene in three 
unrelated kindreds with XR-MSMD. The mutant proteins were produced in normal 
amounts in blood and fibroblastic cells. However, the patients' monocytes 
presented an intrinsic defect in T cell-dependent IL-12 production, resulting in 
defective IFN-gamma secretion by T cells. IL-12 production was also impaired as 
the result of a specific defect in NEMO- and NF-kappaB/c-Rel-mediated CD40 
signaling after the stimulation of monocytes and dendritic cells by 
CD40L-expressing T cells and fibroblasts, respectively. However, the 
CD40-dependent up-regulation of costimulatory molecules of dendritic cells and 
the proliferation and immunoglobulin class switch of B cells were normal. 
Moreover, the patients' blood and fibroblastic cells responded to other 
NF-kappaB activators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, and 
lipopolysaccharide. These two mutations in the NEMO LZ domain provide the first 
genetic etiology of XR-MSMD. They also demonstrate the importance of the T cell- 
and CD40L-triggered, CD40-, and NEMO/NF-kappaB/c-Rel-mediated induction of IL-12 
by monocyte-derived cells for protective immunity to mycobacteria in humans.
