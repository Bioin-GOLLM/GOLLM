In the present study, calcined melamine (CM) and magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) 
were encapsulated in a calcium alginate (CA) matrix to effectively activate 
peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and generate free radical species for the degradation of 
ibuprofen (IBP) drug. According to the Langmuir isotherm model, the adsorption 
capacities of the as-prepared microcapsules and their components were 
insignificant. The CM/MNPs/CA/PMS process caused the maximum degradation of IBP 
(62.4%) in 30 min, with a synergy factor of 5.24. Increasing the PMS 
concentration from 1 to 2 mM improved the degradation efficiency from 62.4 to 
68.0%, respectively, while an increase to 3 mM caused a negligible effect on the 
reactor effectiveness. The process performance was enhanced by ultrasound (77.6% 
in 30 min), UV irradiation (91.6% in 30 min), and electrochemical process (100% 
in 20 min). The roles of O•H and SO4•- in the decomposition of IBP by the 
CM/MNPs/CA/PMS process were 28.0 and 25.4%, respectively. No more than 8% 
reduction in the degradation efficiency of IBP was observed after four 
experimental runs, accompanied by negligible leachate of microcapsule 
components. The bio-assessment results showed a notable reduction in the 
bio-toxicity during the treatment process based on the specific oxygen uptake 
rate (SOUR).
