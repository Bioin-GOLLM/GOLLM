Dynamic tracking of variant frequencies among viruses circulating in the global 
pandemic has revealed the emergence and dominance of a D614G mutation in the 
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. To address whether pandemic SARS-CoV-2 G614 variant 
has evolved to become more pathogenic, we infected adult hamsters (>10 months 
old) with two natural SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying either D614 or G614 spike 
protein to mimic infection of the adult/elderly human population. Hamsters 
infected by the two variants exhibited comparable viral loads and pathology in 
lung tissues as well as similar amounts of virus shed in nasal washes. 
Altogether, our study does not find that naturally circulating D614 and G614 
SARS-CoV-2 variants differ significantly in pathogenicity in hamsters.
