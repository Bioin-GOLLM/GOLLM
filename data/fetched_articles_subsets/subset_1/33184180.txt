The chromatin landscape underlying the specification of human cell types is of 
fundamental interest. We generated human cell atlases of chromatin accessibility 
and gene expression in fetal tissues. For chromatin accessibility, we devised a 
three-level combinatorial indexing assay and applied it to 53 samples 
representing 15 organs, profiling ~800,000 single cells. We leveraged cell types 
defined by gene expression to annotate these data and cataloged hundreds of 
thousands of candidate regulatory elements that exhibit cell type-specific 
chromatin accessibility. We investigated the properties of lineage-specific 
transcription factors (such as POU2F1 in neurons), organ-specific 
specializations of broadly distributed cell types (such as blood and 
endothelial), and cell type-specific enrichments of complex trait heritability. 
These data represent a rich resource for the exploration of in vivo human gene 
regulation in diverse tissues and cell types.
