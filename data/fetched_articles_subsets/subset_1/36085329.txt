Cigarette smoking has been suggested to be associated with the risk of 
schizophrenia in observational studies. A significant causal effect of smoking 
on schizophrenia has been reported in European populations using the Mendelian 
randomization approach; however, no evidence of causality was found in 
participants from East Asia. Using Taiwan Biobank (TWBB), we conducted 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify susceptibility loci for 
smoking behaviors, including smoking initiation (N = 79,989) and the onset age 
(N = 15,582). We then meta-analyzed GWAS from TWBB and Biobank Japan (BBJ) with 
the total sample size of 245,425 for smoking initiation and 46,000 for onset age 
of smoking. The GWAS for schizophrenia was taken from the East Asia Psychiatric 
Genomics Consortium, which included 22,778 cases and 35,362 controls. We 
performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization to estimate the causality of 
smoking behaviors on schizophrenia in East Asia. In TWBB, we identified one 
locus that met genome-wide significance for onset age. In a meta-analysis of 
TWBB and BBJ, we identified two loci for smoking initiation. In Mendelian 
randomization, genetically predicted smoking initiation (odds ratio (OR) = 4.00, 
95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.89-18.01, P = 0.071) and onset age (OR for a 
per-year increase = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.91-1.01, P = 0.098) were not significantly 
associated with schizophrenia; the direction of effect was consistent with 
European Ancestry samples, which had higher statistical power. These findings 
provide tentative evidence consistent with a causal role of smoking on the 
development of schizophrenia in East Asian populations.
