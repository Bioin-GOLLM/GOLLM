BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have reported a significant association between 
matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), particularly (MMP-9), and inflammatory diseases 
including Behçet's disease (BD).
PURPOSE: To study the relationship between MMP-9 rs17576 gene polymorphism and 
the development of BD, and its relation to disease activity among Egyptian 
patients.
METHODS: A total of 100 BD patients and 100 healthy control volunteers were 
genotyped for MMP-9 rs17576 polymorphism with polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), followed by the 
confirmation of our results in random subgroups using direct DNA sequencing 
technique.
RESULTS: The frequency of the GG genotype and G allele was significantly higher 
in BD patients as compared to the normal controls (p = 0.011, OR 8.61; p = 0.03, 
OR 1.65, respectively). There was no significant association between the MMP-9 
rs17576 polymorphism and the clinical outcomes of BD.
CONCLUSION: our study suggests a significant association of the MMP-9 rs17576 
A/G polymorphism with increased risk of BD development in Egyptian patients.
