The mechanical properties of vertebrate cells are largely defined by the system 
of intermediate filaments (IF). As part of a dense network, IF polymers are 
constantly rearranged and relocalized in the cell to fulfill their duty as cells 
change shape, migrate, or divide. With the development of new imaging 
technologies, such as photoconvertible proteins and super-resolution microscopy, 
a new appreciation for the complexity of IF dynamics has emerged. This review 
highlights new findings about the transport of IF, the remodeling of filaments 
by a process of severing and re-annealing, and the subunit exchange that occurs 
between filament precursors and a soluble pool of IF. We will also discuss the 
unique dynamic features of the keratin IF network. Finally, we will speculate 
about how the dynamic properties of IF are related to their functions.
