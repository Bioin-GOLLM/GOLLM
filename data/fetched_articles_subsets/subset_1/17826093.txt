Mutations in the dystrophin gene give rise to Duchenne and Becker muscular 
dystrophies (DMD and BMD), in which both skeletal and cardiac muscles are 
affected, but also to X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDC), a condition 
characterised by exclusive cardiac involvement. XLDC patients with mutations at 
the 5' end of the gene typically have a cardiac specific severe transcriptional 
pathology, with absent dystrophin in the heart, while reduced levels of 
virtually normal dystrophin transcript and protein are present in the skeletal 
muscle. We now report the identification of a new XLDC family and the detailed 
characterisation of the levels of dystrophin protein present in skeletal muscle 
of this family, and of three previously studied XLDC families. We found that 
dystrophin levels comprised between 29% and 57% were sufficient to avoid muscle 
weakness in these XLDC families. This information will be of help for the 
development of therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring dystrophin levels 
sufficient to prevent the muscle pathology in DMD.
