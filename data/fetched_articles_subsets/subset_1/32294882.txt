Human C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase are important markers 
in clinical laboratory testing-the former is used to detect in vivo 
inflammation, and the latter is used to detect cell necrosis and tissue 
destruction. We developed aptamers that bind to human CRP and human lactate 
dehydrogenase-5 (LDH-5) with high affinities (dissociation constants of 6.2 pM 
and 235 pM, respectively), applying the systematic evolution of ligands by 
exponential enrichment (SELEX) method, and by using a modified DNA library 
containing the following base-appended base modifications: analog adenine 
derivative at the fifth position of uracil (Uad), analog guanine derivative at 
the fifth position of uracil (Ugu), and analog adenine derivative at the seventh 
position of adenine (Aad). A potential application of these aptamers as sensor 
elements includes high-sensitivity target detection in point-of-care testing.
