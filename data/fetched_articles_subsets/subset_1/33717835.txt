TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a serine/threonine kinase, is a key 
intermediate in several signaling pathways. However, its role in tumorigenesis 
is still not understood well. In this study, it is found that TAK1 expression 
decreases in esophageal tumor tissues and cell lines. In vitro experiments 
demonstrate that proliferation of esophageal tumor cells is enhanced by 
knockdown of TAK1 expression and attenuated by elevated expression of TAK1. 
Using a subcutaneous tumor model, these observations are confirmed in vivo. 
Based on the results from co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, 
Ras association domain family 9 (RASSF9) is identified as a downstream target of 
TAK1. TAK1 phosphorylates RASSF9 at S284, which leads to reduced RAS 
dimerization, thereby blocking RAF/MEK/ERK signal transduction. Clinical survey 
reveals that TAK1 expression is inversely correlated with survival in esophageal 
cancer patients. Taken together, the data reveal that TAK1-mediated 
phosphorylation of RASSF9 at Ser284 negatively regulates esophageal tumor cell 
proliferation via inhibition of the RAS/MEK/ERK axis.
