Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease with a variable clinical 
presentation, and its prognosis and treatment depend on the extent and severity 
of disease. Although the pathogenesis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis has been 
debated in the past, recent evidence suggests that it is a neoplastic 
proliferation potentially derived from a myeloid-lineage precursor. Involvement 
of the gastrointestinal tract in Langerhans cell histiocytosis is exceedingly 
rare and is most often encountered in the pediatric population, in the setting 
of systemic disease. This is illustrated using a case of Langerhans cell 
histiocytosis involving the esophagus in a 59-year-old woman who presented with 
dysphagia, in which molecular testing documented a BRAF V600E mutation. We 
review the features and implications of this diagnosis.
