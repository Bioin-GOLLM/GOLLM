Environmental oxidative stress threatens cellular integrity and should therefore 
be avoided by living organisms. Yet, relatively little is known about 
environmental oxidative stress perception. Here, using microfluidics, we showed 
that like I2 pharyngeal neurons, the tail phasmid PHA neurons function as 
oxidative stress sensing neurons in C. elegans, but display different responses 
to H2O2 and light. We uncovered that different but related receptors, GUR-3 and 
LITE-1, mediate H2O2 signaling in I2 and PHA neurons. Still, the peroxiredoxin 
PRDX-2 is essential for both, and might promote H2O2-mediated receptor 
activation. Our work demonstrates that C. elegans can sense a broad range of 
oxidative stressors using partially distinct H2O2 signaling pathways in head and 
tail sensillae, and paves the way for further understanding of how the 
integration of these inputs translates into the appropriate behavior.
