Interferon (IFN)-α treatment predisposes patients to the occurrence of 
autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD).
METHODS: We investigated associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
of molecules participating in the IFN-α signature, including rs2304204 and 
rs2304206 of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), rs1061501 of IRF7, and rs7708392 of 
TNFA1P3-interacting protein 1 with serum IFN-α levels and AITD in an ethnic 
Chinese (ie Taiwanese) population. Totally, 319 patients with Graves' disease 
(GD), 83 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and 351 healthy controls 
were recruited.
RESULTS: There were increased percentages of the C allele, and CC and TC + CC 
genotypes of rs1061501 in GD patients compared to the controls. HT patients had 
higher serum IFN-α levels compared to the controls, while there was no 
difference in serum IFN-α levels between patients with GD and controls. However, 
patients with GD in a remission status had lower serum IFN-α levels than those 
without remission. On the other hand, the C allele of rs1061501 was only 
associated with serum IFN-α levels in patients with HT.
CONCLUSIONS: The SNP rs1061501 of IRF7 was associated with the development of 
GD. Serum IFN-α levels were associated with HT, while they might modify the 
disease status of GD. Moreover, a genetic effect of rs1061501 on regulating 
serum IFN-α production was observed in HT.
