The title mol-ecular salt, C(19)H(34)N(+)·C(10)H(7)O(5)S(-), is a charge-control 
agent used for toners in electrophotography with a high melting point of 508 K. 
In the crystal structure, the anions form inversion dimers, linked by pairs of 
O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. Further O-H⋯O links between dimers generate anionic sheets 
propagating in (010). One of the n-butyl chains of the cation is disordered over 
two sets of sites in a 0.53:0.47 ratio.
