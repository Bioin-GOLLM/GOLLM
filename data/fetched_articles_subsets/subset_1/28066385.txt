Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that have small genomes with 
limited coding capacity; therefore, they extensively use host intracellular 
machinery for their replication and infection in host cells. In recent years, it 
was elucidated that plants have evolved intricate defense mechanisms to prevent 
or limit damage from such pathogens. Plants employ two major strategies to 
counteract virus infections: resistance (R) gene-mediated and RNA 
silencing-based defenses. In this review, plant defenses and viral counter 
defenses are described, as are recent studies examining the cross-talk between 
different plant defense mechanisms.
