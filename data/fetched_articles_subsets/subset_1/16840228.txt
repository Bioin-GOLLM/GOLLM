We recently described a rare frameshift mutation in the delta-globin gene in a 
Dutch patient, in association with a new mutation of the Ggamma-globin gene 
promoter [Ggamma -37 (A-->T)] with a moderately elevated Hb F level of 2.3%. The 
delta mutation at codon 91 (+T) has been described once before in our laboratory 
in 1989, in a complex Belgian family with Ggamma (Agammadeltabeta)0-thalassemia 
(thal) and moderately elevated Hb F levels, without the Ggamma 
(Agammadeltabeta)0-thal deletion in some individuals. Analysis of the patients 
from 1989 revealed the presence of the same Ggamma-globin gene mutation and 
moderately elevated Hb F in all patients, who were also carriers of the 
delta-globin gene frameshift. Further analysis demonstrated that the two 
mutations were in linkage with the same haplotype in both the Belgian family and 
the recently found patient, confirming the association of the elevated Hb F 
expression with the new Ggamma-globin gene mutation.
