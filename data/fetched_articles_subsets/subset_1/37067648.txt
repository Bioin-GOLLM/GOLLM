BACKGROUND: Studies have indicated the involvement of interleukin (IL)-33 in the 
pathogenesis of Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This research intended to 
evaluate the association of IL33 gene rs1929992 and rs7044343 Single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) with risk of SLE. In addition, the association between 
these SNPs and inflammatory cytokines was determined.
METHODS: In this study, 200 SLE cases and 200 healthy subjects were recruited. 
Using allelic discrimination Real-time PCR, IL33 gene rs1929992 and rs7044343 
SNPs were genotyped. The mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-33, TNF-α 
were determined in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The serum 
levels of cytokines were also measured.
RESULTS: The G allele (OR = 1.57, CI: 1.18-2.08, P = 0.0017), GG genotype 
(OR = 2.52, CI: 1.33-4.77, P = 0.0043), and GA genotype (OR = 2.12, CI: 
1.34-3.34, P = 0.0011) of rs1929992 SNP was significantly associated with an 
increased SLE risk. The C allele (OR = 1.44, CI: 1.08-1.90; P = 0.0105), CC 
genotype (OR = 2.07, CI: 1.15-3.71; P = 0.0146), and CT genotype (OR = 1.61, CI: 
1.02-2.53, P = 0.0395) of rs7044343 was significantly associated with increased 
SLE risk. The PBMC mRNA expression and serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-33, TNF-α 
were significantly increased in the SLE patients compared to controls. However, 
there was no significant difference in the mRNA expression and serum levels of 
IL-1β, IL-6, IL-33, and TNF-α among the SLE patients with three genotypes for 
both rs1929992 and rs7044343 polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS: IL33 gene rs1929992 and rs7044343 SNPs are involved in SLE 
pathogenesis but they might not influence on the inflammatory pathway.
