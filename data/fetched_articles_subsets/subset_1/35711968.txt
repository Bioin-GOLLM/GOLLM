PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate potential causes of FDT visual field loss 
in a selected group of Fabry subjects.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a pilot observational study. Subjects were 
assessed during 2 visits. The following tests were performed: visual acuity, 
tonometry, optical coherence tomography (OCT) optic nerve scan, frequency 
doubling time (FDT) and threshold (SAP) VF, ERG, and Online 
Spectro-reflectometry Oxygenation Measurement in the Eye (OSOME). Results are 
compared across visits and, when indicated, interpreted against those collected 
on non-Fabry population matched for age and sex.
RESULTS: The study population was composed of 3 males (34.3 ± 8.9 y.o.) and 5 
females (46.4 ± 6.5 y.o). For all subjects, BCVA remained 6/6 OU throughout the 
study and OCT optic nerve scans were normal. FDT showed a defect in at least 1 
quadrant for all participants, in contrast with SAP. FDT PSD value was found 
different vs SAP. For ERG, the i-wave (52.1 + 2.7 ms) and B-waves (31.6 ± 2.1 
ms) peak times were significantly longer compared to a non-Fabry population (p < 
0.05). Overall blood oxygenation varied from 61.3% ± 4% to 68.1% ± 4% at the 
second visit, suggesting a loss of capillary perfusion. Blood volume varied 
based on location (superior/inferior), eye tested (OD/OS) and time (visit 1/2). 
The range of values exceeds normal subjects findings (p < 0.05). Blood volume 
was correlated to FDT PSD value for the superior area of the optic nerve.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Fabry subjects present FDT deficits and 
abnormal ERG patterns that may be explained by a retinal dysfunction affecting 
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), second to vascular alterations.
