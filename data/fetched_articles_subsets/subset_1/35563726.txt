Parthenocarpy, the pollination-independent fruit set, can raise the productivity 
of the fruit set even under adverse factors during the reproductive phase. The 
application of plant hormones stimulates parthenocarpy, but artificial hormones 
incur extra financial and labour costs to farmers and can induce the formation 
of deformed fruit. This study examines the performance of parthenocarpic mutants 
having no transcription factors of SlIAA9 and SlTAP3 and sldella that do not 
have the protein-coding gene, SlDELLA, in tomato (cv. Micro-Tom). At 0 day after 
the flowering (DAF) stage and DAFs after pollination, the sliaa9 mutant 
demonstrated increased pistil development compared to the other two mutants and 
wild type (WT). In contrast to WT and the other mutants, the sliaa9 mutant with 
pollination efficiently stimulated the build-up of auxin and GAs after 
flowering. Alterations in both transcript and metabolite profiles existed for WT 
with and without pollination, while the three mutants without pollination 
demonstrated the comparable metabolomic status of pollinated WT. Network 
analysis showed key modules linked to photosynthesis, sugar metabolism and cell 
proliferation. Equivalent modules were noticed in the famous parthenocarpic 
cultivars 'Severianin', particularly for emasculated samples. Our discovery 
indicates that controlling the genes and metabolites proffers future breeding 
policies for tomatoes.
