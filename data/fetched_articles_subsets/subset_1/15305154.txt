Early-onset melanoma under the age of 20 years is still a rare disease but has 
an increasing incidence. The aim of this study was to determine whether CDKN2A 
germline mutations are present in patients diagnosed with childhood/adolescent 
melanoma. From the Swedish Cancer Register we identified 60 patients with a 
diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma before the age of 20 years. A medical 
history including information on self-reported melanoma heredity was obtained, a 
physical examination was performed by a dermatologist, and the histopathology 
slides were reviewed. A blood test was obtained for analysis of germline CDKN2A 
exon 1 and exon 2 mutations by DNA sequencing. We found only one germline CDKN2A 
mutation with functional significance, which was an exon 1 missense mutation 
resulting in a proline-to-leucine substitution in codon 48. This mutation was 
seen in a patient belonging to a previously reported kindred with hereditary 
melanoma where this particular germline CDKN2A mutation had been identified. 
Thus, in the large majority of cutaneous melanoma in childhood/adolescence, any 
underlying genetic alterations have yet to be identified.
