NEMO is a scaffolding protein which plays an essential role in the NF-κB pathway 
by assembling the IKK-complex with the kinases IKKα and IKKβ. Upon activation, 
the IKK complex phosphorylates the IκB molecules leading to NF-κB nuclear 
translocation and activation of target genes. Inhibition of the NEMO/IKK 
interaction is an attractive therapeutic paradigm for the modulation of NF-κB 
pathway activity, making NEMO a target for inhibitors design and discovery. To 
facilitate the process of discovery and optimization of NEMO inhibitors, we 
engineered an improved construct of the IKK-binding domain of NEMO that would 
allow for structure determination of the protein in the apo form and while bound 
to small molecular weight inhibitors. Here, we present the strategy utilized for 
the design, expression and structural characterization of the IKK-binding domain 
of NEMO. The protein is expressed in E. coli cells, solubilized under denaturing 
conditions and purified through three chromatographic steps. We discuss the 
protocols for obtaining crystals for structure determination and describe data 
acquisition and analysis strategies. The protocols will find wide applicability 
to the structure determination of complexes of NEMO and small molecule 
inhibitors.
