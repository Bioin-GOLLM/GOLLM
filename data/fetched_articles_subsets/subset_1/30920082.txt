X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common hereditary rickets, caused by 
mutations in PHEX encoding the phosphate regulating endopeptidase homolog 
X-linked. Here, we report a nonsense variant in exon 11 of PHEX (c.1209G>A 
p.Trp403*) cosegregating with XLH in a Chinese family with a LOD score of 2.70. 
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated 
that p.Trp403* variant did not cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), but 
significantly increased the expression level of FGF23 mRNA in the patients. 
Interestingly, p.Trp403* significantly reduced phosphorylation of p38 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not ERK1/2. Moreover, overexpression 
of FGF23 significantly decreased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, whereas knockdown 
of FGF23 by siRNA significantly increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. These 
data suggest that p.Trp403* may not function via an NMD mechanism, and instead 
causes XLH via a novel signaling mechanism involving PHEX, FGF23, and p38 MAPK. 
This finding provides important insights into genetic and molecular mechanisms 
for the pathogenesis of XLH.
