Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) controls many physiological pathways, and is 
implicated in many diseases including Alzheimer's and several cancers. 
GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of target residues in microtubule-associated 
protein tau (MAPTAU) contributes to MAPTAU hyperphosphorylation and subsequent 
formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Inhibitors of GSK3β protect against 
Alzheimer's disease and are therapeutic for several cancers. A thiadiazolidinone 
drug, TDZD-8, is a non-ATP-competitive inhibitor targeting GSK3β with 
demonstrated efficacy against multiple diseases. However, no experimental data 
or models define the binding mode of TDZD-8 with GSK3β, which chiefly reflects 
our lack of an established inactive conformation for this protein. Here, we used 
metadynamic simulation to predict the three-dimensional structure of the 
inactive conformation of GSK3β. Our model predicts that phosphorylation of GSK3β 
Serine9 would hasten the DFG-flip to an inactive state. Molecular docking and 
simulation predict the TDZD-8 binding conformation of GSK3β to be inactive, and 
are consistent with biochemical evidence for the TDZD-8-interacting residues of 
GSK3β. We also identified the pharmacophore and assessed binding efficacy of 
second-generation TDZD analogs (TDZD-10 and Tideglusib) that bind GSK3β as 
non-ATP-competitive inhibitors. Based on these results, the predicted inactive 
conformation of GSK3β can facilitate the identification of novel GSK3β 
inhibitors of high potency and specificity.
