BACKGROUND: Mutations in the cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) gene are 
frequently found as a cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, only 
a few studies have analysed genotype-phenotype correlations in small series of 
patients. The present study sought to determine the clinical characteristics, 
penetrance and prognosis of HCM with an identical mutation in MYBPC3.
METHODS: 154 non-related patients with HCM (aged 55±16 years, 100 (64.9%) males) 
were studied. 18 (11.7%) were found to have an identical mutation in the MYBPC3 
gene (IVS23+1G→A). Pedigree analysis, including both clinical evaluation and 
genotyping, was performed.
RESULTS: 152 individuals (mean age 37±18 years, 53.3% males) from 18 families 
were evaluated. 65 carriers of the IVS23+1G→A mutation were identified, 61.5% of 
whom met HCM diagnostic criteria. Penetrance of the disease increased with age, 
with 50% affected at 46 years of age. Males tended to develop the disease 
earlier than females. 7 (15.6%) had systolic dysfunction. Compared with the rest 
of the HCM cohort, probands with the mutation had more hypertrophy and were 
younger at diagnosis. There was a trend towards a reduced survival free from 
sudden death (SD) (HR 1.71; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.98, p=0.059). There were 17 SD 
cases in 12 families with the mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: The MYBPC3 IVS23+1G→A mutation is associated with middle-age onset 
disease and poor outcome, with a significant proportion of patients developing 
systolic impairment and a high SD risk profile.
