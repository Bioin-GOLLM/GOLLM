Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant inherited 
cardiovascular disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy and 
cardiomyocyte disarray. In this study, a skin biopsy was obtained from a HCM 
patient, who carried a missense mutation (c.4384G > A; p.E1462K) in the myosin 
heavy chain 7 (MYH7) gene. The skin fibroblasts were subsequently reprogrammed 
with a non-integrated Sendai viral method to generate a patient-specific induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line. The generated iPSC line showed typical 
morphology and normal karyotype, expressed pluripotency markers, and was capable 
to differentiate into three germ layers.
