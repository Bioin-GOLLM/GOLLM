PURPOSE: To describe clinical and neuropsychological features of six consecutive 
sporadic girls with protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) mutations.
METHODS: Following recent descriptions of PCDH19 mutation in girls with 
epilepsy, we sequenced this gene in patients with infantile or early childhood 
seizures onset, either focal or generalized, without an obvious etiology.
KEY FINDINGS: Mean age at the time of the study was 13.5 ± 11 years. Mean age at 
seizure onset was 15.5 ± 11 months (range 9-38). All patients experienced 
clusters of either focal or generalized seizures, precipitated during febrile 
illness in five patients. Attacks were very frequent at onset, but they became 
less numerous during follow-up. Ictal electroencephalography (EEG) showed 
temporal lobe involvement in five patients. Periictal EEG showed focal or 
multifocal epileptiform and slow abnormalities. Cognitive impairment became 
obvious after seizure onset in three patients and was associated with autistic 
features in two. Genetic analysis revealed five new and one known de novo PCDH19 
mutation that were missense in four and frameshift in two. Variants are 
clustered in the large exon 1, corresponding to the extracellular domain of the 
PCDH19 protein.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings emphasize that de novo PCDH19 mutations are 
associated with infantile or early childhood onset of febrile or afebrile 
seizures often occurring in clusters. Cognitive impairment is not constantly 
present and autistic features are observed in some patients. Most patients have 
a "stormy" seizure onset, often related to fever; however, seizure severity does 
not clearly correlate with the degree of cognitive deficit. PCDH19 is likely a 
major epilepsy gene; phenotypes associated with mutations of this gene range 
from epileptic encephalopathies to mild epilepsy, yet large series of patients 
will be necessary to fully delineate phenotypic spectrum.
