Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is useful for difficult to 
cultivate pathogens. Here, we use cerebrospinal fluid mNGS to diagnose invasive 
meningococcal disease. The complete genome sequences of Neisseria meningitidis 
were assembled using N. meningitidis of ST4821-serotype C isolated from four 
patients. To investigate the phylogeny, 165 CC4821 N. meningitidis genomes from 
1972 to 2017 were also included. The core genome accumulated variation at a rate 
of 4.84×10-8 substitutions/nucleotide site/year. CC4821 differentiated into four 
sub-lineages during evolution (A, B, C, and D). While evolving from sub-lineage 
A (early stage) to sub-lineage D (late stage), the ST and CC4821 serotype 
converged into the ST4821-serotype C clone. Most strains of sub-lineage D were 
isolated from invasive meningococcal disease, with increasing resistance to 
quinolones. Phylogeographic analysis suggests that CC4821 has spread across 14 
countries. Thus, the selective pressure of quinolones may cause CC4821 to 
converge evolutionarily, making it more invasive and facilitating its spread.
