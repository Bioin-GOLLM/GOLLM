Obesity and malnutrition both cause dysbiosis and dampen retinoic acid (RA) 
signaling pathways, which play pivotal roles in biological processes. The 
current study evaluates a hypothesis that colitis-associated dysbiosis also has 
systemic negative impacts on RA signaling. Thus, we studied the effects of 
inflammation, under a vitamin A-sufficient condition, on RA signaling using 
mouse colitis models induced by dextran sulfate sodium. That data showed that 
intestinal inflammation resulted in reduced RA signaling in the liver, brain, 
gut, and adipose tissues measured by analyzing the expression of genes encoding 
for the synthesis, oxidation, transport, and receptor of RA. The expression of 
RA-regulated gut homing molecules including α4β7 integrin, and CCR9, along with 
MADCAM1 were all reduced in colitis mice revealing compromised immunity due to 
reduced RA signaling. The data also showed that the development of colitis was 
accompanied by dysbiosis featured with reduced Lactobacillaceae and 
Verrucomicrobiaceae but an expansion of Erysipelotrichaceae and others. Colitis 
resulted in reduced butyrate-producing bacteria and increased methane-generating 
bacteria. Additionally, dysbiosis was associated with induced Il-1β, Ifn-γ, and 
Tnf-α mRNA but reduced Il-22, Il-17f, and Rorγt transcripts in the colon. 
Together, intestinal inflammation inhibits RA signaling in multiple organs. RA 
is essential in regulating various biological processes, it is critical to 
detect RA signaling reduction in tissues even when vitamin A deficiency is 
absent. Moreover, probiotics can potentially prevent dysbiosis and reverse 
compromised RA signaling, having systemic health benefits.
