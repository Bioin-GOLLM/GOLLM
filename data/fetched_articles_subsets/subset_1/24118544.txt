The cells walls of filamentous fungi in the genus Aspergillus have 
galactofuranose (Galf)-containing polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, including 
O-glycans, N-glycans, fungal-type galactomannan and 
glycosylinositolphosphoceramide, which are important for cell wall integrity. 
Here, we attempted to identify galactofuranosyltransferases that couple Galf 
monomers onto other wall components in Aspergillus nidulans. Using 
reverse-genetic and biochemical approaches, we identified that the AN8677 gene 
encoded a galactofuranosyltransferase, which we called GfsA, involved in Galf 
antigen biosynthesis. Disruption of gfsA reduced binding of β-Galf-specific 
antibody EB-A2 to O-glycosylated WscA protein and galactomannoproteins. The 
results of an in-vitro Galf antigen synthase assay revealed that GfsA has β1,5- 
or β1,6-galactofuranosyltransferase activity for O-glycans in glycoproteins, 
uses UDP-d-Galf as a sugar donor, and requires a divalent manganese cation for 
activity. GfsA was found to be localized at the Golgi apparatus based on 
cellular fractionation experiments. ΔgfsA cells exhibited an abnormal morphology 
characterized by poor hyphal extension, hyphal curvature and limited formation 
of conidia. Several gfsA orthologues were identified in members of the 
Pezizomycotina subphylum of Ascomycota, including the human pathogen Aspergillus 
fumigatus. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a fungal 
β-galactofuranosyltransferase, which was shown to be involved in Galf antigen 
biosynthesis of O-glycans in the Golgi.
