Grass leaves develop from a ring of primordial initial cells within the 
periphery of the shoot apical meristem, a pool of organogenic stem cells that 
generates all of the organs of the plant shoot. At maturity, the grass leaf is a 
flattened, strap-like organ comprising a proximal supportive sheath surrounding 
the stem and a distal photosynthetic blade. The sheath and blade are partitioned 
by a hinge-like auricle and the ligule, a fringe of epidermally derived tissue 
that grows from the adaxial (top) leaf surface. Together, the ligule and auricle 
comprise morphological novelties that are specific to grass leaves. 
Understanding how the planar outgrowth of grass leaves and their adjoining 
ligules is genetically controlled can yield insight into their evolutionary 
origins. Here we use single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses to identify a 'rim' 
cell type present at the margins of maize leaf primordia. Cells in the leaf rim 
have a distinctive identity and share transcriptional signatures with 
proliferating ligule cells, suggesting that a shared developmental genetic 
programme patterns both leaves and ligules. Moreover, we show that rim function 
is regulated by genetically redundant Wuschel-like homeobox3 (WOX3) 
transcription factors. Higher-order mutations in maize Wox3 genes greatly reduce 
leaf width and disrupt ligule outgrowth and patterning. Together, these findings 
illustrate the generalizable use of a rim domain during planar growth of maize 
leaves and ligules, and suggest a parsimonious model for the homology of the 
grass ligule as a distal extension of the leaf sheath margin.
