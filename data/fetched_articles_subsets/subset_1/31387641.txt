BACKGROUND: One of the mechanisms by which tumors evade immune surveillance is 
through shedding of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I 
chain-related protein A and B (MICA/B) from their cell surface. MICA/B are 
ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D on NK and CD8 T cells. This shedding 
reduces cell surface levels of MICA/B and impairs NKG2D recognition. Shed MICA/B 
can also mask NKG2D receptor and is thought to induce NKG2D internalization, 
further compromising immune surveillance by NK cells.
METHODS: We isolated human primary NK cells from normal donors and tested the 
suppressive activity of soluble recombinant MICA in vitro. Utilizing a panel of 
novel anti-MICA antibodies, we further examined the stimulatory activities of 
anti-MICA antibodies that reversed the suppressive effects of soluble MICA.
RESULTS: We show that suppressive effects of soluble MICA (sMICA) on NK cell 
cytolytic activity was not due to the down-regulation of cell surface NKG2D. In 
the presence of an α3 domain-specific MICA antibody, which did not obstruct 
NKG2D binding, sMICA-mediated NK cell suppression was completely reversed. 
Reversal of NK cell inhibition by sMICA was mediated by immune complex formation 
that agonized NKG2D signaling. Furthermore, this restorative activity was 
dependent on antibody Fc effector function as the introduction of Fc mutations 
to abrogate Fc receptor binding failed to reverse sMICA-mediated NK cell 
suppression. Furthermore, MICA immune complexes preformed with an α3 
domain-specific antibody (containing a wild-type Fc) induced IFN-γ and TNF-α 
secretion by NK cells in the absence of cancer cells, whereas MICA immune 
complexes preformed with the Fc effectorless antibody failed to induce IFN-γ and 
TNF-α secretion. Finally, we demonstrated that MICA immune complexes formed with 
the α3 domain-specific antibody activates NKG2D on NK cells leading to the 
release of IFN-γ.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that an α3 domain-specific MICA antibody 
can circumvent sMICA-mediated suppression of NK cell cytolytic activity. 
Moreover, our data suggest that MICA immune complexes formed with α3-specific 
antibodies can activate NKG2D receptor and restore NK cell function in a 
Fc-dependent manner. The clinical utility of α3 domain-specific MICA/B 
antibodies may hold great promise as a new strategy for cancer immunotherapy.
