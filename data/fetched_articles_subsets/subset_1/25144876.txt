Sensory experience orchestrates the development of cortical circuitry by 
adaptively modifying neurotransmission and synaptic connectivity. However, the 
mechanisms underlying these experience-dependent modifications remain elusive. 
Here we demonstrate that visual experience suppresses a presynaptic NMDA 
receptor (preNMDAR)-mediated form of timing-dependent long-term depression 
(tLTD) at visual cortex layer (L) 4-2/3 synapses. This tLTD can be maintained 
during development, or reinstated in adulthood, by sensory deprivation. The 
changes in tLTD are mirrored by changes in glutamate release; visual deprivation 
enhances both tLTD and glutamate release. These effects require the GluN3A NMDAR 
subunit, the levels of which are increased by visual deprivation. Further, by 
coupling the pathway-specific optogenetic induction of tLTD with 
cell-type-specific NMDAR deletion, we find that visual experience modifies 
preNMDAR-mediated plasticity specifically at L4-L2/3 synapses.
