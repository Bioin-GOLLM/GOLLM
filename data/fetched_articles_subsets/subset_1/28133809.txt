It is clear that antibodies can play a pivotal role in preventing the 
transmission of HIV-1 and large efforts to identify an effective antibody-based 
vaccine to quell the epidemic. Shortly after HIV-1 was discovered as the cause 
of AIDS, the search for epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies became 
the driving strategy for an antibody-based vaccine. Neutralization escape 
variants were discovered shortly thereafter, and, after almost three decades of 
investigation, it is now known that autologous neutralizing antibody responses 
and their selection of neutralization resistant HIV-1 variants can lead to 
broadly neutralizing antibodies in some infected individuals. This observation 
drives an intensive effort to identify a vaccine to elicit broadly neutralizing 
antibodies. In contrast, there has been less systematic study of antibody 
specificities that must rely mainly or exclusively on other protective 
mechanisms, although non-human primate (NHP) studies as well as the RV144 
vaccine trial indicate that non-neutralizing antibodies can contribute to 
protection. Here we propose a novel strategy to identify new epitope targets 
recognized by these antibodies for which viral escape is unlikely or impossible.
