Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with a subset of both lymphoid 
and epithelial malignancies. During the EBV latency program, some viral products 
involved in the malignant transformation of infected cells are expressed. Among 
them, the BamHI-A rightward frame 1 (BARF1) is consistently detected in 
nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) and EBV-associated gastric carcinomas (EBVaGCs) 
but is practically undetectable in B-cells and lymphomas. Although BARF1 is an 
early lytic gene, it is expressed during epithelial EBV latency, mainly as a 
secreted protein (sBARF1). The capacity of sBARF1 to disrupt both innate and 
adaptive host antiviral immune responses contributes to the immune escape of 
infected cells. Additionally, BARF1 increases cell proliferation, shows 
anti-apoptotic effects, and promotes an increased hTERT activity and tumor 
formation in nude mice cooperating with other host proteins such as c-Myc and 
H-ras. These facts allow for the consideration of BARF1 as a key protein for 
promoting EBV-associated epithelial tumors. In this review, we focus on 
structural and functional aspects of BARF1, such as mechanisms involved in 
epithelial carcinogenesis and its capacity to modulate the host immune response.
