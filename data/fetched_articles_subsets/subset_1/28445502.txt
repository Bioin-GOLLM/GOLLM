Faithful segregation of the genetic material during the cell cycle is key for 
the continuation of life. Central to this process is the assembly of a bipolar 
spindle that aligns the chromosomes and segregates them to the two daughter 
cells. Spindle bipolarity is strongly dependent on the activity of the 
homotetrameric kinesin Eg5. However, another kinesin, Kif15, also provides 
forces needed to separate the spindle poles during prometaphase and to maintain 
spindle bipolarity at metaphase. Here we identify KBP as a specific interaction 
partner of Kif15 in mitosis. We show that KBP promotes the localization of Kif15 
to the spindle equator close to the chromosomes. Both Kif15 and KBP are required 
for the alignment of all the chromosomes to the metaphase plate and the assembly 
of stable kinetochore fibers of the correct length. Taken together our data 
uncover a novel role for Kif15 in complex with KBP during mitosis.
