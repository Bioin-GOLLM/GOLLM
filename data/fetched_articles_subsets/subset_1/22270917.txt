Cell migration is a dynamic process that involves the continuous formation, 
maturation, and turnover of matrix-cell adhesion sites. New (nascent) adhesions 
form at the protruding cell edge in a tension-independent manner and are 
comprised of integrin receptors, signaling, and cytoskeletal-associated 
proteins. Integrins recruit focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the cytoskeletal 
protein talin to nascent adhesions. Canonical models support a role for talin in 
mediating FAK localization and activation at adhesions. Here, alternatively, we 
show that FAK promotes talin recruitment to nascent adhesions occurring 
independently of talin binding to Î²1 integrins. The direct binding site for 
talin on FAK was identified, and a point mutation in FAK (E1015A) prevented 
talin association and talin localization to nascent adhesions but did not alter 
integrin-mediated FAK recruitment and activation at adhesions. Moreover, FAK 
E1015A inhibited cell motility and proteolytic talin cleavage needed for 
efficient adhesion dynamics. These results support an alternative linkage for 
FAK-talin interactions within nascent adhesions essential for the control of 
cell migration.
