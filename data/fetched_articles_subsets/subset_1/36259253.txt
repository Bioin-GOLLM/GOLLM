A phase II, multicenter study of lazertinib as consolidation therapy in patients 
with locally advanced, unresectable, EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung 
cancer (stage III) who have not progressed following definitive, platinum-based, 
chemoradiation therapy (PLATINUM trial).

INTRODUCTION: The PACIFIC study demonstrated that durvalumab consolidation 
therapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) in patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). However, there was no 
clinical benefit in both PFS and OS in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
mutation-positive patient groups in a post hoc exploratory analysis. Moreover, 
the clinical effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in EGFR 
mutation-positive stage IV NSCLC were demonstrated to be poor. Personalized 
treatment according to the mutation status is also required in stage III NSCLC. 
Lazertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is newly 
developed and approved for use in Korea.
METHODS: This prospective, open, single-arm, multicenter, phase II clinical 
trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lazertinib as a consolidative 
therapy after CCRT treatment in unresectable, EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC stage 
III patients. The primary endpoint of this study is PFS, and the secondary 
endpoints are OS, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), 
time to death or distant metastasis (TTDM), and safety profiles.
DISCUSSION: Our study may extend the indications for third-generation EGFR-TKIs 
to treat patients with stage III NSCLC. Moreover, using this drug to treat stage 
III NSCLC would emphasize the value of mutation analysis and personalized 
medicine.
