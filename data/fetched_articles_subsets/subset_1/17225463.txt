Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MDR1 gene that are responsible for 
drug efflux can cause toxicity. Therefore, this study determined the SNPs of the 
Korean MDR1 gene, and analyzed the haplotypes and a linkage disequilibrium (LD) 
of the SNPs determined. The frequency of 9 SNPs from the MDR1 gene was 
determined by PCR-RFLP analyses of 100 to 500 healthy individuals. The frequcies 
of the SNPs were C3435T (47.7%), G2677T (37.6%), G2677A (4.4%), T1236C (21.7%), 
T129C (8%), A2956G (2.5%), T307C (1.5%), A41aG (9.2%), C145G (0%), and G4030C (0 
%). Analyses of the haplotype structure and an estimation of the LD of the 
combined polymorphisms demonstrated that the frequency of the 1236T-2677G-3435T 
haplotype is much higher in Koreans (14.1%) than in Chinese and western black 
Africans and the C3435T SNP in Koreans appears to have LD with T129C in Koreans 
for the first time. These results provide insight into the genetic variation of 
MDR1 in Koreans, and demonstrated the possibility of a new LD in this gene.
