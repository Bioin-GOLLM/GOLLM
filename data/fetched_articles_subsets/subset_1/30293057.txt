UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGT), catalysing conjugation of UDP-activated sugar 
donors to small lipophilic chemicals, are widespread in living organisms from 
bacteria to fungi, plant, or animals. The progress of genome sequencing has 
enabled an assessment of the UGT multigene family in Haemonchus contortus 
(family Trichostrongylidae, Nematoda), a hematophagous gastrointestinal parasite 
of small ruminants. Here we report 32 putative UGT genes divided into 15 UGT 
families. Phylogenetic analysis in comparison with UGTs from Caenorhabditis 
elegans, a free-living model nematode, revealed several single member 
homologues, a lack of the dramatic gene expansion seen in C. elegans, but also 
several families (UGT365, UGT366, UGT368) expanded in H. contortus only. The 
assessment of constitutive UGT mRNA expression in H. contortus adults identified 
significant differences between females and males. In addition, we compared the 
expression of selected UGTs in the drug-sensitive ISE strain to two 
benzimidazole-resistant strains, IRE and WR, with different genetic backgrounds. 
Constitutive expression of UGT368B2 was significantly higher in both resistant 
strains than in the sensitive strain. As resistant strains were able to 
deactivate benzimidazole anthelmintics via glycosylation more effectively then 
the sensitive strain, UGT368B2 enhanced constitutive expression might contribute 
to drug resistance in H. contortus.
