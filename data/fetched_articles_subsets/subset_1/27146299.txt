BACKGROUND: Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is an intractable neurological 
disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of alternating hemiplegia 
accompanied by other paroxysmal symptoms. Recent research has identified 
mutations in the ATP1A3 gene as the underlying cause. Adenosine-5'-triphosphate 
has a vasodilatory effect, can enhance muscle strength and physical performance, 
and was hypothesized to improve the symptoms of paroxysmal hemiplegia.
METHODS: A 7-year-old boy with alternating hemiplegia of childhood who was 
positive for a de novo ATP1A3 mutation was treated with adenosine- 5'- 
triphosphate supplementation orally as an innovative therapy for 2 years. 
Outcome was evaluated through the follow-up of improvement of hemiplegic 
episodes and psychomotor development. Side effects and safety were monitored in 
regularity.
RESULTS: With the dosage of adenosine-5'-triphosphate administration increased, 
the patient showed significantly less frequency and shorter duration of 
hemiplegic episodes. Treatment with adenosine-5'-triphosphate was correlated 
with a marked amelioration of alternating hemiplegia of childhood episodes, and 
psychomotor development has improved. The maximum dose of oral administration of 
adenosine-5'-triphosphate reached 25 mg/kg per day. Adenosine-5'-triphosphate 
therapy was well tolerated without complaint of discomfort and side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2-year follow-up outcome of adenosine-5'-triphosphate therapy 
for alternating hemiplegia of childhood was successful.
