OBJECTIVE: Several studies have reported that single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B gene on chromosome 9p21.3 are associated with 
increased risk of intracranial aneurysm (IA). However, the association between 
IAs and SNPs of CDKN2A/CDKN2B in Chinese Han people is yet to be evaluated. This 
study examined the association of the SNPs rs10811661 and rs4977574 with IA in 
the Chinese Han population.
METHODS: A total of 595 IA patients and 600 sex- and age-matched controls were 
enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood was collected and stored at -80°C until 
use. CDKN2A/CDKN2B was identified using polymerase chain reaction-ligase 
detection reaction. SNP genotyping was performed for rs10811661 and rs4977574 
using a MassArray system. Associations between these two SNPs and IAs was tested 
with χ2 or Fisher's exact tests and multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: rs10811661 and rs4977574 were significantly associated with IA. The 
frequency of rs10811661-T in IA was higher than in controls (OR 1.26, 95% CI 
1.07-1.49; P<0.01). There was no significant difference in frequency of 
haplotype between control subjects and IA patients.
CONCLUSION: rs10811661 and rs4977574 on 9p21.3 were strongly associated with 
genetic susceptibility to IA in the Chinese Han population, which emphasizes a 
need for further investigation.
