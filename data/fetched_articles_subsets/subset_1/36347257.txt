Humanity has faced three recent outbreaks of novel betacoronaviruses, 
emphasizing the need to develop approaches that broadly target coronaviruses. 
Here, we identify 55 monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent donors 
that bind diverse betacoronavirus spike proteins. Most antibodies targeted an S2 
epitope that included the K814 residue and were non-neutralizing. However, 11 
antibodies targeting the stem helix neutralized betacoronaviruses from different 
lineages. Eight antibodies in this group, including the six broadest and most 
potent neutralizers, were encoded by IGHV1-46 and IGKV3-20. Crystal structures 
of three antibodies of this class at 1.5-1.75-Ã… resolution revealed a conserved 
mode of binding. COV89-22 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern including 
Omicron BA.4/5 and limited disease in Syrian hamsters. Collectively, these 
findings identify a class of IGHV1-46/IGKV3-20 antibodies that broadly 
neutralize betacoronaviruses by targeting the stem helix but indicate these 
antibodies constitute a small fraction of the broadly reactive antibody response 
to betacoronaviruses after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
