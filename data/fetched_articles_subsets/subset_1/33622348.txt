BACKGROUND: The Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type-1 (HTLV-1) is a blood-borne 
pathogen and etiological agent of Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) and 
HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 has 
currently infected up to 10 million globally with highly endemic areas in Japan, 
Africa, the Caribbean and South America. We have previously shown that 
Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) enhance HTLV-1 transmission by promoting cell-cell 
contact.
RESULTS: Here, we separated EVs into subpopulations using differential 
ultracentrifugation (DUC) at speeds of 2 k (2000×g), 10 k (10,000×g), and 100 k 
(100,000×g) from infected cell supernatants. Proteomic analysis revealed that 
EVs contain the highest viral/host protein abundance in the 2 k subpopulation 
(2 k > 10 k > 100 k). The 2 k and 10 k populations contained viral proteins 
(i.e., p19 and Tax), and autophagy proteins (i.e., LC3 and p62) suggesting 
presence of autophagosomes as well as core histones. Interestingly, the use of 
2 k EVs in an angiogenesis assay (mesenchymal stem cells + endothelial cells) 
caused deterioration of vascular-like-tubules. Cells commonly associated with 
the neurovascular unit (i.e., astrocytes, neurons, and macrophages) in the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) showed that HTLV-1 EVs may induce expression of 
cytokines involved in migration (i.e., IL-8; 100 k > 2 k > 10 k) from astrocytes 
and monocyte-derived macrophages (i.e., IL-8; 2 k > 10 k). Finally, we found 
that EVs were able to promote cell-cell contact and viral transmission in 
monocytic cell-derived dendritic cell. The EVs from both 2 k and 10 k increased 
HTLV-1 spread in a humanized mouse model, as evidenced by an increase in 
proviral DNA and RNA in the Blood, Lymph Node, and Spleen.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data suggest that various EV subpopulations 
induce cytokine expression, tissue damage, and viral spread.
