Schwann cells ensure efficient nerve impulse conduction in the peripheral 
nervous system. Their development is accompanied by defined chromatin changes, 
including variant histone deposition and redistribution. To study the importance 
of variant histones for Schwann cell development, we altered their genomic 
distribution by conditionally deleting Ep400, the central subunit of the 
Tip60/Ep400 complex. Ep400 absence causes peripheral neuropathy in mice, 
characterized by terminal differentiation defects in myelinating and 
non-myelinating Schwann cells and immune cell activation. Variant histone H2A.Z 
is differently distributed throughout the genome and remains at promoters of 
Tfap2a, Pax3 and other transcriptional regulator genes with transient function 
at earlier developmental stages. Tfap2a deletion in Ep400-deficient Schwann 
cells causes a partial rescue arguing that continued expression of early 
regulators mediates the phenotypic defects. Our results show that proper genomic 
distribution of variant histones is essential for Schwann cell differentiation, 
and assign importance to Ep400-containing chromatin remodelers in the process.
