Stress priming is an important strategy for enhancing plant defense capacity to 
deal with environmental challenges and involves reprogrammed transcriptional 
responses. Although ultraviolet (UV) light exposure is a widely adopted approach 
to elicit stress memory and tolerance in plants, the molecular mechanisms 
underlying UV-mediated plant priming tolerance are not fully understood. Here, 
we investigated the changes in the global transcriptome profile of wild Arachis 
stenosperma leaves in response to UV-C exposure. A total of 5751 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with the majority associated with cell 
signaling, protein dynamics, hormonal and transcriptional regulation, and 
secondary metabolic pathways. The expression profiles of DEGs known as 
indicators of priming state, such as transcription factors, transcriptional 
regulators and protein kinases, were further characterized. A meta-analysis, 
followed by qRT-PCR validation, identified 18 metaDEGs as being commonly 
regulated in response to UV and other primary stresses. These genes are involved 
in secondary metabolism, basal immunity, cell wall structure and integrity, and 
may constitute important players in the general defense processes and 
establishment of a priming state in A. stenosperma. Our findings contribute to a 
better understanding of transcriptional dynamics involved in wild Arachis 
adaptation to stressful conditions of their natural habitats.
