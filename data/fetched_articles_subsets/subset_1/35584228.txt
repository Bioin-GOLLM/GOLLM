Most well-characterized cases of adaptation involve single genetic loci. Theory 
suggests that multilocus adaptive walks should be common, but these are 
challenging to identify in natural populations. Here, we combine trait mapping 
with population genetic modeling to show that a two-step process rewired 
nutrient homeostasis in a population of Arabidopsis as it colonized the base of 
an active stratovolcano characterized by extremely low soil manganese (Mn). 
First, a variant that disrupted the primary iron (Fe) uptake transporter gene 
(IRT1) swept quickly to fixation in a hard selective sweep, increasing Mn but 
limiting Fe in the leaves. Second, multiple independent tandem duplications 
occurred at NRAMP1 and together rose to near fixation in the island population, 
compensating the loss of IRT1 by improving Fe homeostasis. This study provides a 
clear case of a multilocus adaptive walk and reveals how genetic variants 
reshaped a phenotype and spread over space and time.
