Focal amplifications (FA) can mediate targeted therapy resistance in cancer. 
Understanding the structure and dynamics of FAs is critical for designing 
treatments that overcome plasticity-mediated resistance. We developed a melanoma 
model of dual MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) resistance that bears BRAFV600 
amplifications through either extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)/double minutes (DM) 
or intrachromosomal homogenously staining regions (HSR). Cells harboring 
BRAFV600E FAs displayed mode switching between DMs and HSRs, from both de novo 
genetic changes and selection of preexisting subpopulations. Plasticity is not 
exclusive to ecDNAs, as cells harboring HSRs exhibit drug addiction-driven 
structural loss of BRAF amplicons upon dose reduction. FA mechanisms can couple 
with kinase domain duplications and alternative splicing to enhance resistance. 
Drug-responsive amplicon plasticity is observed in the clinic and can involve 
other MAPK pathway genes, such as RAF1 and NRAS. BRAF FA-mediated dual 
MAPKi-resistant cells are more sensitive to proferroptotic drugs, extending the 
spectrum of ferroptosis sensitivity in MAPKi resistance beyond cases of 
dedifferentiation.
SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the structure and dynamics of oncogene 
amplifications is critical for overcoming tumor relapse. BRAF amplifications are 
highly plastic under MAPKi dosage challenges in melanoma, through involvement of 
de novo genomic alterations, even in the HSR mode. Moreover, BRAF FA-driven, 
dual MAPKi-resistant cells extend the spectrum of resistance-linked ferroptosis 
sensitivity. This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 873.
