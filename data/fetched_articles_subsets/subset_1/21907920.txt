Targeting chromatin regulators for the treatment of malignancies has shown great 
promise, but also revealed significant challenges. By employing an elegant shRNA 
screen and a selective pharmacological inhibitor, a recent study published in 
Nature establishes the bromodomain protein Brd4 as novel target in acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML).
