OBJECTIVES: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are first line treatment choices 
for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). However, responses vary among patients, therefore good 
biomarkers predicting better responses are required. EGFR mutations are detected 
in the blood from patients as circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Studies have shown 
that clearing ctDNA during first line TKI treatment predicts outcomes for first 
and second generation TKI treatments. We aimed to investigate the effects on 
outcome measures of ctDNA clearing in subsequent treatment lines to treatment 
with the third generation TKI osimertinib.
METHODS: In total, 225 patients were included in a prospective, multicentre 
study, where consecutive blood samples were monitored for EGFR mutations during 
systemic treatment lines, using the Cobas® EGFR mutation test v2. This study 
focused on EGFR mutations in ctDNA of 82 systemically pre-treated patients 
receiving osimertinib.
RESULTS: Clearing all EGFR mutations from the blood after osimertinib treatment, 
significantly predicted progression-free survival, objective response rates and 
disease control rates. Primary sensitising EGFR mutations were found in ctDNA in 
70 % of patients, and were accompanied by the T790 M mutation in nearly two 
thirds of cases. The T790 M mutation was cleared in all cases, while the 
accompanying sensitising mutations did not necessarily clear. However, T790 M 
clearing without simultaneously clearing of the primary sensitising mutation did 
not predict clinical responses. Neither the detection of T790 M before 
osimertinib treatment, nor the presence of EGFR mutations at the time of 
osimertinib initiation predicted clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The clearing of EGFR mutations in ctDNA after osimertinib treatment 
initiation in patients with advanced NSCLC is useful as a positive predictor of 
clinical outcome.
