Neurofibromin is a large and multifunctional protein encoded by the tumor 
suppressor gene NF1, mutations of which cause the tumor predisposition syndrome 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Over the last three decades, studies of 
neurofibromin structure, interacting partners, and functions have shown that it 
is involved in several cell signaling pathways, including the Ras/MAPK, 
Akt/mTOR, ROCK/LIMK/cofilin, and cAMP/PKA pathways, and regulates many 
fundamental cellular processes, such as proliferation and migration, 
cytoskeletal dynamics, neurite outgrowth, dendritic-spine density, and dopamine 
levels. The crystallographic structure has been resolved for two of its 
functional domains, GRD (GAP-related (GTPase-activating protein) domain) and 
SecPH, and its post-translational modifications studied, showing it to be 
localized to several cell compartments. These findings have been of particular 
interest in the identification of many therapeutic targets and in the proposal 
of various therapeutic strategies to treat the symptoms of NF1. In this review, 
we provide an overview of the literature on neurofibromin structure, function, 
interactions, and regulation and highlight the relationships between them.
