INTRODUCTION: Despite the evidence available on the adverse impact of 
gestational diabetes (GDM) and thyroid disorders on developing type 2 diabetes 
(T2DM), the concurrent influence of these disorders on the incidence of T2DM has 
not been reported yet.
METHODS: In this prospective study, 1894 non-diabetic women aged 20 to 60 years, 
with a history of at least one term delivery, without diagnosed hyperthyroidism 
were selected at the initiation of the Tehran Thyroid Study (TTS). Pooled 
logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the association of GDM, 
thyroid disorders i.e., hypothyroidism and/or thyroid peroxidase antibody 
(TPOAb) positivity and interaction between GDM and thyroid disorders with the 
risk of incident T2DM.
RESULTS: Of the 1894 participants of the present study, 346 (18.3%) had a 
history of GDM, and 832 (43.9%) had thyroid disorders. The total cumulative 
incidence rate of T2DM at the median follow-up time of ~ 12 years was overall 
12/1000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 10/1000-13/1000), with an 
incidence rate of 16/1000 (95%CI: 13/1000-20/1000) in women with GDM; and 
11/100,000 (95%CI: 9/100,000-12/1000) among those without GDM. After adjustment 
for age, the risk of incident T2DM increased among individuals with the previous 
GDM compared to women without a history of GDM (odds ratio (OR): 1.54, 95%CI: 
1.06, 2.25). No significant associations were found between either thyroid 
disorders or the interaction between GDM and thyroid disorders with the 
development of T2DM; (OR: 1.14, 95%CI: 0.82, 1.58) and (OR: 1.27, 95%CI: 0.66, 
2.43), respectively.
CONCLUSION: GDM and thyroid disorders have no concurrent impacts on the 
incidence of T2DM.
