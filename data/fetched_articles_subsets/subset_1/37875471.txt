Plasma amyloid-β (Aβ)42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, and neurofilament light 
chain (NfL) are promising biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
whether these biomarkers can predict AD in Chinese populations is yet to be 
fully explored. We therefore tested the performance of these plasma biomarkers 
in 126 participants with preclinical AD and 123 controls with 8-10 years of 
follow-up from the China Cognition and Aging Study. Plasma Aβ42, p-tau181, and 
NfL were significantly correlated with cerebrospinal fluid counterparts and 
significantly altered in participants with preclinical AD. Combining plasma 
Aβ42, p-tau181, and NfL successfully discriminated preclinical AD from controls. 
These findings were validated in a replication cohort including 51 familial AD 
mutation carriers and 52 non-carriers from the Chinese Familial Alzheimer's 
Disease Network. Here we show that plasma Aβ42, p-tau181, and NfL may be useful 
for predicting AD 8 years before clinical onset in Chinese populations.
