Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent programmed cell death pattern that is 
characterized by iron overload, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and 
lipid peroxidation. Growing viewpoints support that the imbalance of iron 
homeostasis and the disturbance of lipid metabolism contribute to tissue or 
organ injury in various kidney diseases by triggering ferroptosis. At present, 
the key regulators and complicated network mechanisms associated with 
ferroptosis have been deeply studied; however, its role in the initiation and 
progression of kidney diseases has not been fully revealed. Herein, we aim to 
discuss the features, key regulators and complicated network mechanisms 
associated with ferroptosis, explore the emerging roles of organelles in 
ferroptosis, gather its pharmacological progress, and systematically summarize 
the most recent discoveries about the crosstalk between ferroptosis and kidney 
diseases, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), acute kidney injury (AKI), 
diabetic kidney disease (DKD), autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 
(ADPKD), renal fibrosis, lupus nephritis (LN) and IgA nephropathy. We further 
conclude the potential therapeutic strategies by targeting ferroptosis for the 
prevention and treatment of kidney diseases and hope that this work will provide 
insight for the further study of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of 
kidney-related diseases.
