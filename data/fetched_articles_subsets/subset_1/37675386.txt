In recent years, there has been a growing interest in controlling the motion of 
microparticles inside and outside a focused laser beam. A hydro-thermophoretic 
trap was recently reported [Nalupurackal et al., Soft Matter 18, 6825 (2022)], 
which can trap and manipulate microparticles and living cells outside a laser 
beam. Briefly, a hydro-thermophoretic trap works by the competition between 
thermoplasmonic flows due to laser heating of a substrate and thermophoresis 
away from the hotspot of the laser. Here, we extend that work to demonstrate the 
controlled roll rotation of a microparticle in a hydro-thermophoretic trap using 
experiments and theory. We experimentally measure the roll angular velocity of 
the trapped particle. We predict this roll rotation from theoretical computation 
of the fluid flow. The expression for the angular velocity fits the experimental 
data. Our method has potential applications in microrheology by employing a 
different mode of rotation.
