Nucleic acids encode the information of life, programming cellular functions and 
dictating many biological outcomes. Differentiating between cells based on their 
nucleic acid programs is, thus, a powerful way to unravel the genetic bases of 
many phenotypes. This is especially important considering that most cells exist 
in heterogeneous populations, requiring them to be isolated before they can be 
studied. Existing flow cytometry techniques, however, are unable to reliably 
recover specific cells based on nucleic acid content. Nucleic acid cytometry is 
a new field built on droplet microfluidics that allows robust identification, 
sorting, and sequencing of cells based on specific nucleic acid biomarkers. This 
review highlights applications that immediately benefit from the approach, 
biological questions that can be addressed for the first time with it, and 
considerations for building successful workflows.
