The 10th and 11th residues of parathyroid hormone PTH(1-12) analogues were 
substituted to study the structure and function of PTH analogues. The 
substitution of Ala(10) of [Ala(3,10,12)(Leu(7)/Phe(7))Arg(11)]rPTH(1-12)NH(2) 
with Glu(10) and/or the Arg(11) with Ile(11) markedly decreased cAMP generating 
activity. Data from circular dichroism (CD) and the nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) structural analysis of [Ala(3,10,12)(Leu(7)/Phe(7))Arg(11)]rPTH(1-12)NH(2) 
revealed tight alpha-helical structures, while the Glu(10) and/or Ile(11) 
substituted analogues showed unstable alpha-helical structures. We conclude that 
10th and 11th residues are important for stabilizing its helical conformation 
and that destabilization of the alpha-helical structure, induced by substituting 
the above residues, remarkably affect its biological potency.
