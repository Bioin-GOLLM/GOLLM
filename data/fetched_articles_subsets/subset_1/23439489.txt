Multiple osteochondromas is an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder 
characterized by the formation of multiple cartilage-capped tumours. Two causal 
genes have been identified, EXT1 and EXT2, which account for 65% and 30% of 
cases, respectively. We have undertaken a mutation analysis of the EXT1 and EXT2 
genes in 39 unrelated Spanish patients, most of them with moderate phenotype, 
and looked for genotype-phenotype correlations. We found the mutant allele in 37 
patients, 29 in EXT1 and 8 in EXT2. Five of the EXT1 mutations were deletions 
identified by MLPA. Two cases of mosaicism were documented. We detected a lower 
number of exostoses in patients with missense mutation versus other kinds of 
mutations. In conclusion, we found a mutation in EXT1 or in EXT2 in 95% of the 
Spanish patients. Eighteen of the mutations were novel.
