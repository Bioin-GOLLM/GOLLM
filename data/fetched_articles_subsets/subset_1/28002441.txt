Galectin-3, a chimeric type β-galactoside-binding protein, is known to modulate 
viral infection; however, its role in enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection has not 
been investigated. We generated galectin-3 null rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and 
evaluated whether EV71 infection would be affected. In galectin-3 null cells, 
the released and intracellular EV71 viral loads were suppressed after 24 h of 
infection, and cell death rates were significantly lower, while cell 
proliferation remained unaltered. In addition, RD cells expressing a 
nonsynonymous genetic variant of galectin-3, rs4644 (LGALS3 +191C/A, P64H), 
produced lower virus titers than those with wild-type galectin-3 (C allele). To 
clarify whether the in vitro viral load reduction correlates with clinical 
severity, we enrolled children with laboratory-confirmed EV71 infection. Since 
hyperglycemia is an indicator of severe EV71 infection in children, 152 of 401 
enrolled children had glucose examinations at admission, and 59 subjects had 
serum glucose levels ≥ 150 mg/dL. In comparison to the rs4644 AA genotype (2.2 ± 
0.06 log10 mg/dL), serum glucose levels during EV71 infection were higher in 
patients with CC (2.4 ± 0.17 log10 mg/dL, p = 0.03) and CA (2.4 ± 0.15 log10 
mg/dL, p = 0.02) genotypes, respectively. These findings suggest that the rs4644 
AA genotype of galectin-3 might exert a protective effect. In summary, 
galectin-3 affects EV71 replication in our cellular model and its variant, 
rs4644, is associated with hyperglycemia in the clinical setting. The underlying 
mechanism and its potential therapeutic application warrant further 
investigation.
