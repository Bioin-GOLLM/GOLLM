BACKGROUND: Alport syndrome (AS) is a renal disease that is characterized by 
proteinuria and progressive renal failure, and often accompanied by 
sensorineural hearing loss and ocular changes. Mutations in the genes encoding 
for three members of the type IV collagen protein family have been found to be 
the cause of the disease. We describe a large Turkish family with X-linked AS. 
We performed linkage analysis in this family and sequencing to identify the 
mutation in the proband whose disease was confirmed by renal biopsy.
METHODS: After genomic DNAs extracted, linkage to the COL4A5 locus was examined 
using the 2B6 and 2B20, DXS1106, DXS1105 and COL4A5 markers. In addition, COL4A5 
gene sequence analysis was performed in the proband.
RESULTS: Genetic linkage analysis demonstrated co-segregation of the disease. 
Haplotype analysis showed that the same haplotype was carried by all affected 
males and obligatory carrier females. Mutation analysis of the proband has 
revealed a novel nonsense mutation (c.1135C>T; Gln379X) in exon 19 of the COL4A5 
gene which may lead to a more severe phenotype in affected family members 
carrying this mutation. According to GenBank data base, this mutation has not 
been reported previously.
CONCLUSION: Genetic testing identified a previously undescribed COL4A5 mutation 
as the cause of the disease.
