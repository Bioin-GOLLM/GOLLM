BACKGROUND: DNMT3A mutations are frequently discovered in acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML), associated with poor outcome. Recently, a relapse case report of AML 
extramedullary disease has showed that AML cells harboring DNMT3A variation were 
detected in the cerebral spinal fluid. However, whether a causal relationship 
exists between DNMT3A mutation (D3Amut) and extramedullary infiltration (EMI) is 
unclear.
METHODS: We took advantage of DNMT3A (R882C) mutation-carrying AML cell strain, 
that is, OCI-AML3, assessing its migration ability in vitro and in vivo. By RNA 
interfering technology and a xenograft mouse model, we evaluated the effect of 
DNMT3A mutation on cell mobility and explored the possible mechanism.
RESULTS: OCI-AML3 displayed extraordinary migration ability in vitro and 
infiltrated into meninges of NOD/SCID mice after intravenous transfusion. We 
found that this leukemic migration or infiltration capacity was significantly 
compromised by the knockdown of DNMT3A mutant. Notably, TWIST1, a critical 
inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which underlies the metastasis of 
carcinomas, was highly expressed in association with R882 mutations. Abrogation 
of TWIST1 in DNMT3A mutated cells considerably weakened their mobility or 
infiltration.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that D3Amut in OCI-AML3 strain enhances 
leukemic aggressiveness by promoting EMI process, which is partially through 
upregulating TWIST1.
