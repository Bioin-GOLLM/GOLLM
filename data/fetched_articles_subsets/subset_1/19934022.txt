Most T lymphocytes appear to arise from very rare early T lineage progenitors 
(ETPs) in the thymus, but the transcriptional programs that specify ETP 
generation are not completely known. The transcription factor GATA-3 is required 
for the development of T lymphocytes at multiple late differentiation steps as 
well as for the development of thymic natural killer cells. However, a role for 
GATA-3 before the double-negative (DN) 3 stage of T cell development has to date 
been obscured both by the developmental heterogeneity of DN1 thymocytes and the 
paucity of ETPs. We provide multiple lines of in vivo evidence through the 
analysis of T cell development in Gata3 hypomorphic mutant embryos, in 
irradiated mice reconstituted with Gata3 mutant hematopoietic cells, and in mice 
conditionally ablated for the Gata3 gene to show that GATA-3 is required for ETP 
generation. We further show that Gata3 loss does not affect hematopoietic stem 
cells or multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. Finally, we demonstrate that 
Gata3 mutant lymphoid progenitors exhibit neither increased apoptosis nor 
diminished cell-cycle progression. Thus, GATA-3 is required for the 
cell-autonomous development of the earliest characterized thymic T cell 
progenitors.
