Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is believed to play an important role in inducing 
Th1-type cytokine profiles. Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) 
are considered to be Th2 and Th1 type disease, respectively. The IL-12 p40 
subunit gene (IL12B) is located at chromosome 5q31-33 and linkage findings of AD 
on 5q31 were reported. Recently single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (1188A/C) 
of IL12B has been reported. In function, it has been reported that this SNP is 
associated with IL12B mRNA expression levels. To learn whether this SNP is 
associated with susceptibility to AD or PsV, we investigated the genotype and 
allele frequencies of the SNP in AD patients, in PsV patients and in controls, 
examining 164 AD patients, 143 PsV patients and 100 healthy individuals in 
Japanese population. Genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The A allele was 
decreased in AD patients (40.9%, p = 0.031) and increased in PsV patients 
(60.1%, p = 0.035) compared with controls (50.5%). This suggests that IL12B SNP 
is associated with susceptibility to AD and PsV, presumably by affecting the 
Th1/Th2 balance.
