Pollution by heavy metals limits the area of land available for cultivation of 
food crops. A potential solution to this problem might lie in the molecular 
breeding of food crops for phytoremediation that accumulate toxic metals in 
straw while producing safe and nutritious grains. Here, we identify a rice 
quantitative trait locus we name cadmium (Cd) accumulation in leaf 1 (CAL1), 
which encodes a defensin-like protein. CAL1 is expressed preferentially in root 
exodermis and xylem parenchyma cells. We provide evidence that CAL1 acts by 
chelating Cd in the cytosol and facilitating Cd secretion to extracellular 
spaces, hence lowering cytosolic Cd concentration while driving long-distance Cd 
transport via xylem vessels. CAL1 does not appear to affect Cd accumulation in 
rice grains or the accumulation of other essential metals, thus providing an 
efficient molecular tool to breed dual-function rice varieties that produce safe 
grains while remediating paddy soils.
