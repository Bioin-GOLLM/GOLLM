Owing to the diversity of cancer types and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of 
tumour signals, high-resolution imaging of occult malignancy is challenging. 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography allows for near-universal 
cancer detection, yet in many clinical scenarios it is hampered by false 
positives. Here, we report a method for the amplification of imaging contrast in 
tumours via the temporal integration of the imaging signals triggered by tumour 
acidosis. This method exploits the catastrophic disassembly, at the acidic pH of 
the tumour milieu, of pH-sensitive positron-emitting neutral copolymer micelles 
into polycationic polymers, which are then internalized and retained by the 
cancer cells. Positron emission tomography imaging of the 64Cu-labelled polymers 
detected small occult tumours (10-20â€‰mm3) in the brain, head, neck and breast of 
mice at much higher contrast than 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, 11C-methionine and 
pH-insensitive 64Cu-labelled nanoparticles. We also show that the pH-sensitive 
probes reduce false positive detection rates in a mouse model of non-cancerous 
lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. This macromolecular strategy for 
integrating tumour acidosis should enable improved cancer detection, 
surveillance and staging.
