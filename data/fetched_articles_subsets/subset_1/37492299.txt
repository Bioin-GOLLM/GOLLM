Lipoid proteinosis is a rare multisystem genodermatosis inherited as autosomal 
recessive trait. We report a case of lipoid proteinosis in a 10-year-old boy 
born to first-degree consanguineous parents presented with marked hoarseness of 
voice, accelerated photoaging appearance, enlarged and erythematous tongue with 
restricted movement and widespread dermatoses. Biopsy of oral mucosa revealed 
Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive amorphous eosinophilic hyaline deposits. 
Mutational analysis revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation with C to T 
substitution at nucleotide position 1246(c.1246C>T) in exon-8 of the 
extracellular matrix protein 1 gene leading to a stop codon. Both the parents 
were unaffected heterozygous carriers. To our knowledge, this is the first case 
report of lipoid proteinosis with evidence of a novel nonsense genetic mutation 
from Bangladesh.
