Gene conversion (655G splicing mutation) and the founder effect (Gln318Stop) 
contribute to the most frequent severe point mutations in congenital adrenal 
hyperplasia (21-hydroxylase deficiency) in the Spanish population.

This study addresses the contributions of gene conversion and a founder effect 
to the distribution of the two most frequent severe point mutations of the 
21-hydroxylase (21OH) gene causing congenital adrenal hyperplasia: the 655G 
splicing mutation at intron 2, and Gln318Stop in a Spanish population. Direct 
and indirect analyses of segregated mutant and normal 21OH genes in 200 Spanish 
families (classic and nonclassic 21OH deficiency) were performed. Both 
mechanisms were found to contribute to different degrees to the defective 
investigated alleles. The 655G splicing mutation (62 alleles, 15.5%) seemed to 
be almost exclusively related to recent conversion events, whereas Gln318Stop 
(33 alleles, 8.3%) is more likely to be due to the dissemination of remotely 
generated mutant alleles. Other severe defective alleles, 8 bp-deletion (13 
alleles, 3.3%), 306insT (5 alleles, 1.3%), and gene deletions (43 alleles, 11%), 
as well as the mild mutation Val281Leu (120 alleles, 30%), also appear to be 
strongly associated with particular D6S273 alleles. Although gene conversion 
contributes to the generation of severe 21OH alleles, the high frequency of some 
severe mutations in different geographic areas is consistent with a founder 
effect.
