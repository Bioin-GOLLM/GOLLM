This paper reviews the published evidence on genetically driven variation in 
neurotransmitter function and brain circuits involved in emotion. Several 
studies point to a role of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism in 
amygdala activation during emotion perception. We also discuss other 
polymorphisms (e.g. the COMT val158met polymorphism, tryptophan hydroxylase-2 
-703 G/T) and putative effects on affective processing in cortical and limbic 
regions. A different line of research concerns studies with genetic disorders. 
Although at a less fine-grained level, studies with individuals with 
aneuploidies of the X chromosome (Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome), who 
display impairments in emotion processing, have resulted in new insights and 
hypotheses with regard to X chromosomal influences on brain systems supporting 
cognition and emotion. These have also implicated a key role for the amygdala. 
Integration of the emerging evidence, suggests that the study of polymorphisms 
using brain imaging can potentially elucidate biological pathways and mechanisms 
contributing to individual differences in brain circuits that may bias behavior 
and affect risk for psychiatric illness.
