INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the 
polymorphism in the kinase-binding domain of A-kinase anchoring protein 10 
(AKAP10) was related to the risk of occurrence of potentially dangerous 
arrhythmias during kidney transplant.
METHODS: We performed this prospective observational study with additional 
patient monitoring during the kidney transplant procedure and in the 
postoperative period with continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) - (digital holter; 
ECG monitor type 300-7 Suprima system; Oxford, UK). After manual trace analysis, 
we performed classification of arrhythmias by interval measurement (including QT 
correction according to Bazett's formula: Qtc = QT/RR1/2), ST segment analysis 
within all channels, and analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) parameters 
(time analysis: SDNN as total rate variability measure, SDANN as long-term 
variability measure, SDNNindex, rMSSD and pNN50 as short-term variability 
measure) as well as frequency measure of power width parameters in the spectrum 
between 0.0033 Hz and 0.4 Hz. Subsequently applying polymerase chain reaction 
restriction fragment length polymorphism methods, we investigated A1936G 
(rs203462) AKAP10 polymorphism among 54 kidney recipients.
RESULTS: Analysis of variance showed that prolongation of the QTc interval 
associated with the variant genotypes (GG + AG) was significantly greater 
compared with the AA genotype among kidney recipients (P = .04). We did not 
observe a relationship between the AKAP10 polymorphism and other arrhythmias, or 
clinical or environmental factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that the AKAP10 (rs203462) GG + AG variation was 
associated with an increased risk of severe arrhythmias during kidney 
transplantation.
