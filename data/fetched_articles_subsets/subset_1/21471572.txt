BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Premature intra-acinar activation of trypsinogen is widely 
considered key for both the initiation of acute pancreatitis and the development 
of chronic pancreatitis. However, the biological consequences of intracellular 
trypsinogen activation have not been directly examined. To do so, a new mouse 
model was developed.
METHODS: Mice were engineered to conditionally express an endogenously activated 
trypsinogen within pancreatic acinar cells (PACE-tryp(on)). Hallmarks of 
pancreatitis were determined and findings were correlated to the level 
(zygosity) and extent (temporal and spatial) of conditional PACE-tryp(on) 
expression. Furthermore, the impact of acinar cell death in PACE-tryp(on) mice 
was assessed and compared with a model of selective diphtheria toxin 
(DT)-mediated induction of acinar apoptosis.
RESULTS: Initiation of acute pancreatitis was observed with high (homozygous), 
but not low (heterozygous) levels of PACE-tryp(on) expression. Subtotal 
(maximal-rapid induction) but not limited (gradual-repetitive induction) 
conditional PACE-tryp(on) expression was associated with systemic complications 
and mortality. Rapid caspase-3 activation and apoptosis with delayed necrosis 
was observed, and loss of acinar cells led to replacement with fatty tissue. 
Chronic inflammation or fibrosis did not develop. Selective depletion of 
pancreatic acinar cells by apoptosis using DT evoked similar consequences.
CONCLUSIONS: Intra-acinar activation of trypsinogen is sufficient to initiate 
acute pancreatitis. However, the primary response to intracellular trypsin 
activity is rapid induction of acinar cell death via apoptosis which facilitates 
resolution of the acute inflammation rather than causing chronic pancreatitis. 
This novel model provides a powerful tool to improve our understanding of basic 
mechanisms occurring during pancreatitis.
