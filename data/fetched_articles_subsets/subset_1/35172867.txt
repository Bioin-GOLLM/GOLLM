BACKGROUND: The genetic landscape of neurodevelopmental disorders is constantly 
expanding and children with early-onset neurological phenotypes increasingly 
receive a genetic diagnosis. Nonetheless, the awareness of the chronic course of 
these conditions, and consequently their recognition and management in the adult 
population, is still limited.
RESULTS: Herein, we describe four patients with rare neurodevelopmental 
disorders (SON, ZMYND11, DNMT1 and YY1-related diseases), who received a genetic 
assignment only in the adulthood. All these patients had an early developmental 
delay and displayed a movement disorder (dystonia/ataxia/tremor) which 
manifested for the first time, or worsened, in the adulthood, prompting the 
referral to a neurologist. This phenotypic combination led eventually to the 
genetic testing. We report previously unrecognized features and highlight the 
peculiarities of the adult presentation of four neurodevelopmental disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: This report expands the current knowledge on four rare 
neurodevelopmental disorders (SON, ZMYND11, DNMT1 and YY1), which was mainly 
based on reports from paediatric cases. This case series emphasize the 
importance of a tight neurological surveillance extending beyond the childhood.
