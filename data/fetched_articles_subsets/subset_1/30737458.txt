G proteins are major transducers of signals from G-protein coupled receptors 
(GPCRs). They are made up of α, β, and γ subunits, with 16 Gα, 5 Gβ and 12 Gγ 
subunits. Though much is known about the specificity of Gα subunits, the 
specificity of Gβγs activated by a given GPCR and that activate each effector in 
vivo is not known. Here, we examined the in vivo Gβγ specificity of presynaptic 
α2a-adrenergic receptors (α2aARs) in both adrenergic (auto-α2aARs) and 
non-adrenergic neurons (hetero-α2aARs) for the first time. With a quantitative 
MRM proteomic analysis of neuronal Gβ and Gγ subunits, and 
co-immunoprecipitation of tagged α2aARs from mouse models including transgenic 
FLAG-α2aARs and knock-in HA-α2aARs, we investigated the in vivo specificity of 
Gβ and Gγ subunits to auto-α2aARs and hetero-α2aARs activated with epinephrine 
to understand the role of Gβγ specificity in diverse physiological functions 
such as anesthetic sparing, and working memory enhancement. We detected Gβ2, 
Gγ2, Gγ3, and Gγ4 with activated auto α2aARs, whereas we found Gβ4 and Gγ12 
preferentially interacted with activated hetero-α2aARs. Further understanding of 
in vivo Gβγ specificity to various GPCRs offers new insights into the 
multiplicity of genes for Gβ and Gγ, and the mechanisms underlying GPCR 
signaling through Gβγ subunits.
