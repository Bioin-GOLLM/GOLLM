BACKGROUND: As a new epi-center of COVID-19 in Asia and a densely populated 
developing country, Indonesia is facing unprecedented challenges in public 
health. SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.466.2 was reported to be an indigenous dominant 
strain in Indonesia (once second only to the Delta variant). However, it remains 
unclear how this variant evolved and spread within such an archipelagic nation.
METHODS: For statistical description, the spatiotemporal distributions of the 
B.1.466.2 variant were plotted using the publicly accessible metadata in GISAID. 
A total of 1302 complete genome sequences of Indonesian B.1.466.2 strains with 
high coverage were downloaded from the GISAID's EpiCoV database on 28 August 
2021. To determine the molecular evolutionary characteristics, we performed a 
time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood algorithm and 
called the single nucleotide variants taking the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence as 
reference. To investigate the spatiotemporal transmission patterns, we estimated 
two dynamic parameters (effective population size and effective reproduction 
number) and reconstructed the phylogeography among different islands.
RESULTS: As of the end of August 2021, nearly 85% of the global SARS-CoV-2 
lineage B.1.466.2 sequences (including the first one) were obtained from 
Indonesia. This variant was estimated to account for over 50% of Indonesia's 
daily infections during the period of March-May 2021. The time-scaled phylogeny 
suggested that SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.466.2 circulating in Indonesia might have 
originated from Java Island in mid-June 2020 and had evolved into two 
disproportional and distinct sub-lineages. High-frequency non-synonymous 
mutations were mostly found in the spike and NSP3; the S-D614G/N439K/P681R 
co-mutations were identified in its larger sub-lineage. The demographic history 
was inferred to have experienced four phases, with an exponential growth from 
October 2020 to February 2021. The effective reproduction number was estimated 
to have reached its peak (11.18) in late December 2020 and dropped to be less 
than one after early May 2021. The relevant phylogeography showed that Java and 
Sumatra might successively act as epi-centers and form a stable transmission 
loop. Additionally, several long-distance transmission links across seas were 
revealed.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the tropical archipelago may 
follow unique patterns of evolution and transmission. Continuous, extensive and 
targeted genomic surveillance is essential.
