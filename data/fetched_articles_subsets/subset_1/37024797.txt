BACKGROUND: Starch hydrolysates are energy sources for plant growth and 
development, regulate osmotic pressure and transmit signals in response to both 
biological and abiotic stresses. The α-amylase (AMY) and the β-amylase (BAM) are 
important enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of plant starch. Cassava (Manihot 
esculenta Crantz) is treated as one of the most drought-tolerant crops. However, 
the mechanisms of how AMY and BAM respond to drought in cassava are still 
unknown.
RESULTS: Six MeAMY genes and ten MeBAM genes were identified and characterized 
in the cassava genome. Both MeAMY and MeBAM gene families contain four genes 
with alternative splicing. Tandem and fragment replications play important roles 
in the amplification of MeAMY and MeBAM genes. Both MeBAM5 and MeBAM10 have a 
BZR1/BES1 domain at the N-terminus, which may have transcription factor 
functions. The promoter regions of MeAMY and MeBAM genes contain a large number 
of cis-acting elements related to abiotic stress. MeAMY1, MeAMY2, MeAMY5, and 
MeBAM3 are proven as critical genes in response to drought stress according to 
their expression patterns under drought. The starch content, soluble sugar 
content, and amylase activity were significantly altered in cassava under 
different levels of drought stress.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide fundamental knowledge for not only further 
exploring the starch metabolism functions of cassava under drought stress but 
also offering new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of how cassava 
survives and develops under drought.
