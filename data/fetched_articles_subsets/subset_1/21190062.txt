The solution NMR resonance assignment of the protein backbone is most commonly 
carried out using triple resonance experiments that involve (15)N and (1)HN 
resonances. The assignment becomes problematic when there is resonance overlap 
of (15)N-(1)HN cross peaks. For such residues, one cannot unambiguously link the 
"left" side of the NH root to the "right" side, and the residues associated with 
such overlapping HN resonances remain often unassigned. Here we present a 
solution to this problem: a hybrid (4d,3d) reduced-dimensionality 
HN(CO)CA(CON)CA sequence. In this experiment, the Ca(i) resonance is modulated 
with the frequency of the Ca(i-1) resonance, which helps in resolving the 
ambiguity involved in connecting the Ca(i) and Ca(i-1) resonances for 
overlapping NH roots. The experiment has limited sensitivity, and is only suited 
for small or unfolded proteins. In a companion experiment, (4d,3d) 
reduced-dimensionality HNCO(N)CA, the Ca(i) resonance is modulated with the 
frequency of the CO(i-1) resonance, hence resolving the ambiguity existent in 
pairing up the Ca(i) and CO(i-1) resonances for overlapping NH roots.
