We hypothesized that host antiviral genes induced by type I interferons might 
affect the natural course of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We 
analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 2',5'-oligoadenylate 
synthetase 1 (OAS-1), myxovirus resistance-A (MxA), and double-stranded 
RNA-dependent protein kinase in 44 Vietnamese SARS patients with 103 controls. 
The G-allele of non-synonymous A/G SNP in exon 3 of OAS-1 gene showed 
association with SARS (p=0.0090). The G-allele in exon 3 of OAS-1 and the one in 
exon 6 were in strong linkage disequilibrium and both of them were associated 
with SARS infection. The GG genotype and G-allele of G/T SNP at position -88 in 
the MxA gene promoter were found more frequently in hypoxemic group than in 
non-hypoxemic group of SARS (p=0.0195). Our findings suggest that polymorphisms 
of two IFN-inducible genes OAS-1 and MxA might affect susceptibility to the 
disease and progression of SARS at each level.
