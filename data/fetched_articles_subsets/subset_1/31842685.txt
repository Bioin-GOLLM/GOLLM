Despite recent evidence that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) possesses roles in 
gene regulation distinct from 5-methylcytosine (5mC), relatively little is known 
regarding the functions of 5hmC in mammalian tissues. To address this issue, we 
utilized an approach combining both paired bisulfite (BS) and oxidative 
bisulfite (oxBS) DNA treatment, to resolve genome-wide patterns of 5hmC and 5mC 
in normal breast tissue from disease-free women. Although less abundant than 
5mC, 5hmC was differentially distributed, and consistently enriched among 
breast-specific enhancers and transcriptionally active chromatin. In contrast, 
regulatory regions associated with transcriptional inactivity, such as 
heterochromatin and repressed Polycomb regions, were relatively depleted of 
5hmC. Gene regions containing abundant 5hmC were significantly associated with 
lactate oxidation, immune cell function, and prolactin signaling pathways. 
Furthermore, genes containing abundant 5hmC were enriched among those actively 
transcribed in normal breast tissue. Finally, in independent data sets, normal 
breast tissue 5hmC was significantly enriched among CpG loci demonstrated to 
have altered methylation in pre-invasive breast cancer and invasive breast 
tumors. Primarily, our findings identify genomic loci containing abundant 5hmC 
in breast tissues and provide a genome-wide map of nucleotide-level 5hmC in 
normal breast tissue. Additionally, these data suggest 5hmC may participate in 
gene regulatory programs that are dysregulated during breast-related 
carcinogenesis.
