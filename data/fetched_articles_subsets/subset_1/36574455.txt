Genetic association studies of many heritable traits resulting from 
physiological testing often have modest sample sizes due to the cost and burden 
of the required phenotyping. This reduces statistical power and limits discovery 
of multiple genetic associations. We present a strategy to leverage pleiotropy 
between traits to both discover new loci and to provide mechanistic hypotheses 
of the underlying pathophysiology. Specifically, we combine a colocalization 
test with a locus-level test of pleiotropy. In simulations, we show that this 
approach is highly selective for identifying true pleiotropy driven by the same 
causative variant, thereby improves the chance to replicate the associations in 
underpowered validation cohorts and leads to higher interpretability. Here, as 
an exemplar, we use Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a common disorder diagnosed 
using overnight multi-channel physiological testing. We leverage pleiotropy with 
relevant cellular and cardio-metabolic phenotypes and gene expression traits to 
map new risk loci in an underpowered OSA GWAS. We identify several pleiotropic 
loci harboring suggestive associations to OSA and genome-wide significant 
associations to other traits, and show that their OSA association replicates in 
independent cohorts of diverse ancestries. By investigating pleiotropic loci, 
our strategy allows proposing new hypotheses about OSA pathobiology across many 
physiological layers. For example, we identify and replicate the pleiotropy 
across the plateletcrit, OSA and an eQTL of DNA primase subunit 1 (PRIM1) in 
immune cells. We find suggestive links between OSA, a measure of lung function 
(FEV1/FVC), and an eQTL of matrix metallopeptidase 15 (MMP15) in lung tissue. We 
also link a previously known genome-wide significant peak for OSA in the 
hexokinase 1 (HK1) locus to hematocrit and other red blood cell related traits. 
Thus, the analysis of pleiotropic associations has the potential to assemble 
diverse phenotypes into a chain of mechanistic hypotheses that provide insight 
into the pathogenesis of complex human diseases.
