Preclinical screening with animal models is an important initial step in 
clinical translation of new drug delivery systems. However, establishing 
efficacy, biodistribution, and biotoxicity of complex, multicomponent systems in 
small animal models can be expensive and time-consuming. Zebrafish models 
represent an alternative for preclinical studies for nanoscale drug delivery 
systems. These models allow easy optical imaging, large sample size, and 
organ-specific studies, and hence an increasing number of preclinical studies 
are employing zebrafish models. In this review, we introduce various models and 
discuss recent studies of nanoscale drug delivery systems in zebrafish models. 
Also in the end, we proposed a guideline for the preclinical trials to 
accelerate the progress in this field.
