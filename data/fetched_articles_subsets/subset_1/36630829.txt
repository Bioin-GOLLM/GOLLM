SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous deaths globally. It is of great value to 
predict the evolutionary direction of SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we proposed a 
novel mathematical model that could predict the evolutionary trend of 
SARS-CoV-2. We focus on the mutational effects on viral assembly capacity. A 
robust coarse-grained mathematical model is constructed to simulate the virus 
dynamics in the host body. Both virulence and transmissibility can be quantified 
in this model. A delicate equilibrium point that optimizes the transmissibility 
can be numerically obtained. Based on this model, the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 
might further decrease, accompanied by an enhancement of transmissibility. 
However, this trend is not continuous; its virulence will not disappear but 
remains at a relatively stable range. A virus assembly model which simulates the 
virus packing process is also proposed. It can be explained why a few mutations 
would lead to a significant divergence in clinical performance, both in the 
overall particle formation quantity and virulence. This research provides a 
novel mathematical attempt to elucidate the evolutionary driving force in RNA 
virus evolution.
