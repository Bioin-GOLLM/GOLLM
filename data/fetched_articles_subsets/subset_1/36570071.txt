The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an ongoing threat to global health, and the 
continuing emergence of contagious variants highlights the urgent need for 
additional antiviral therapy to attenuate COVID-19 disease. The SARS-CoV-2 main 
protease (3CLpro) presents an attractive target for such therapy due to its high 
sequence conservation and key role in the viral life cycle. In this study, we 
designed a fluorescent-luminescent cell-based reporter for the detection and 
quantification of 3CLpro intracellular activity. Employing this platform, we 
examined the efficiency of known protease inhibitors against 3CLpro and further 
identified potent inhibitors through high-throughput chemical screening. 
Computational analysis confirmed a direct interaction of the lead compounds with 
the protease catalytic site and identified a prototype for efficient allosteric 
inhibition. These developments address a pressing need for a convenient sensor 
and specific targets for both virus detection and rapid discovery of potential 
inhibitors.
