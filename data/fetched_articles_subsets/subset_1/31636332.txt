The recognition of PPxY viral Late domains by the third WW domain of the HECT-E3 
ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 (hNEDD4-WW3) is essential for the completion of the 
budding process of numerous enveloped viruses, including Ebola, Marburg, HTLV1 
or Rabies. hNEDD4-WW3 has been validated as a promising target for the 
development of novel host-oriented broad spectrum antivirals. Nonetheless, 
finding inhibitors with good properties as therapeutic agents remains a 
challenge since the key determinants of binding affinity and specificity are 
still poorly understood. We present here a detailed structural and thermodynamic 
study of the interactions of hNEDD4-WW3 with viral Late domains combining 
isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR structural determination and molecular 
dynamics simulations. Structural and energetic differences in Late domain 
recognition reveal a highly plastic hNEDD4-WW3 binding site that can accommodate 
PPxY-containing ligands with varying orientations. These orientations are mostly 
determined by specific conformations adopted by residues I859 and T866. Our 
results suggest a conformational selection mechanism, extensive to other WW 
domains, and highlight the functional relevance of hNEDD4-WW3 domain 
conformational flexibility at the binding interface, which emerges as a key 
element to consider in the search for potent and selective inhibitors of 
therapeutic interest.
