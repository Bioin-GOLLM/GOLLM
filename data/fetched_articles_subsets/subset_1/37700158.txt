Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) not only increases the inertia of 
grid-connected system, but also brings the problem of active power oscillation 
under grid disturbance. Therefore, VSG control strategy and system model order 
reduction method with transient electromagnetic power compensation are proposed. 
The closed-loop active power small signal model of the system is established, 
and the influence of transient electromagnetic power compensation on the power 
stability of VSG is analyzed based on root locus method. By removing the items 
which have little influence on the stability of the system in the small signal 
model, the order is reduced to obtain the equivalent second-order model of the 
system. According to the second-order model, the quantitative design criteria of 
the system parameters are given. The proposed transient electromagnetic power 
compensation strategy not only increases the transient equivalent damping of the 
system, but also does not affect the primary frequency modulation 
characteristics and will not cause large overshoot of the output active power. 
The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical analysis, which 
testify the effectiveness and correctness of the system control strategy and the 
model reduction method.
