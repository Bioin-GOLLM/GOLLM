The AAA-ATPase (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) 
valosin-containing protein (VCP), is essential for many cellular pathways 
including but not limited to endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation 
(ERAD), DNA damage responses, and cell cycle regulation. VCP primarily 
identifies ubiquitylated proteins in these pathways and mediates their unfolding 
and degradation by the 26S proteasome. This review summarizes recent research on 
VCP that has uncovered surprising new ways that this ATPase is regulated, new 
aspects of recognition of substrates and novel pathways and substrates that 
utilize its activity.
