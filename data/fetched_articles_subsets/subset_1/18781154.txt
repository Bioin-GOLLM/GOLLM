The close functional relationship between p53 and the breast cancer 
susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 has promoted the investigation of various 
polymorphisms in the p53 gene as possible risk modifiers in BRCA1/2 mutation 
carriers. Specifically, two polymorphisms in p53, c.97-147ins16bp and p.Arg72Pro 
have been analysed as putative breast cancer susceptibility variants, and it has 
been recently reported that a p53 haplotype combining the absence of the 16-bp 
insertion and the presence of proline at codon 72 (No Ins-72Pro) was associated 
with an earlier age at the onset of the first primary tumour in BRCA2 mutation 
carriers in the Spanish population. In this study, we have evaluated this 
association in a series of 2932 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers from the Consortium of 
Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2.
