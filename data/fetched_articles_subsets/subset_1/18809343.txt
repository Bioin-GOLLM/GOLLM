PURPOSE: Allelic variation in the adipokine angiopoietin-like 4 gene 
(ANGPTL4[E40K]) has been cross-sectionally associated with triglycerides, but 
the effects of genotype, or the interaction between genotype and body weight, on 
longitudinal triglyceride change have not been studied.
METHODS: Body weight, triglycerides, and ANGPTL4[E40K] genotype were determined 
at baseline (1987-1989) and at 3 follow-up exams (1990-1992, 1993-1995, 
1996-1998) in 7,939 white ANGPTL4[E40K] G allele homozygotes and 344 A allele 
carriers. Changes in body weight and triglycerides were characterized as the 
difference between exam 4 and baseline measurements.
RESULTS: ANGPTL4[E40K] A allele carriers had triglyceride concentrations that 
were 15 to 18 mg/dL lower than G allele homozygotes at all exams (P<0.0001). 
Triglycerides increased in both genotype groups over the 9-year period 
(+19.1+/-0.9 and +16.2+/-4.1 mg/dL in GG and GA/AA, respectively; P difference, 
0.48). Weight gain was associated with increased triglycerides to a comparable 
degree in both genotype groups (+5.5+/-0.3 and +4.3+/-0.9 mg/dL per 2-kg 
increase in body weight in GG and GA/AA, respectively, p interaction=0.30).
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in triglyceride concentrations between ANGPTL4[E40K] A 
allele carriers and G allele homozygotes are maintained over time, but the 
degree of increase in triglycerides was similar between groups and was not 
modified by body weight changes.
