Chemokines control the migration of cells in normal physiological processes and 
in the context of disease such as inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer. Two 
major interactions are involved: (i) binding of chemokines to chemokine 
receptors, which activates the cellular machinery required for movement; and 
(ii) binding of chemokines to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which facilitates the 
organization of chemokines into haptotactic gradients that direct cell movement. 
Chemokines can bind and activate their receptors as monomers; however, the 
ability to oligomerize is critical for the function of many chemokines in vivo 
Chemokine oligomerization is thought to enhance their affinity for GAGs, and 
here we show that it significantly affects the ability of chemokines to 
accumulate on and be retained by heparan sulfate (HS). We also demonstrate that 
several chemokines differentially rigidify and cross-link HS, thereby affecting 
HS rigidity and mobility, and that HS cross-linking is significantly enhanced by 
chemokine oligomerization. These findings suggest that chemokine-GAG 
interactions may play more diverse biological roles than the traditional 
paradigms of physical immobilization and establishment of chemokine gradients; 
we hypothesize that they may promote receptor-independent events such as 
physical re-organization of the endothelial glycocalyx and extracellular matrix, 
as well as signalling through proteoglycans to facilitate leukocyte adhesion and 
transmigration.
