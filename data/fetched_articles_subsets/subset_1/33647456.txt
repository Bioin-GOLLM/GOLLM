Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has led to impressive clinical 
responses in patients with hematological malignancies; however, its 
effectiveness in patients with solid tumors has been limited. While CAR T cells 
for the treatment of advanced prostate and pancreas cancer, including those 
targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), are being clinically evaluated and 
are anticipated to show bioactivity, their safety and the impact of the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) have not been faithfully explored 
preclinically. Using a novel human PSCA knockin (hPSCA-KI) immunocompetent mouse 
model, we evaluated the safety and therapeutic efficacy of PSCA-CAR T cells. We 
demonstrated that cyclophosphamide (Cy) pre-conditioning significantly modified 
the immunosuppressive TME and was required to uncover the efficacy of PSCA-CAR 
T cells in metastatic prostate and pancreas cancer models, with no observed 
toxicities in normal tissues with endogenous expression of PSCA. This 
combination dampened the immunosuppressive TME, generated pro-inflammatory 
myeloid and T cell signatures in tumors, and enhanced the recruitment of 
antigen-presenting cells, as well as endogenous and adoptively transferred 
T cells, resulting in long-term anti-tumor immunity.
