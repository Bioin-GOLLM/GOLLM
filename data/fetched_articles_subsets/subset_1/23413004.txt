We report a target enrichment method to map nucleosomes of large genomes at 
unprecedented coverage and resolution by deeply sequencing locus-specific 
mononucleosomal DNA enriched via hybridization with bacterial artificial 
chromosomes. We achieved ≈ 10 000-fold enrichment of specific loci, which 
enabled sequencing nucleosomes at up to ≈ 500-fold higher coverage than has been 
reported in a mammalian genome. We demonstrate the advantages of generating 
high-sequencing coverage for mapping the center of discrete nucleosomes, and we 
show the use of the method by mapping nucleosomes during T cell differentiation 
using nuclei from effector T-cells differentiated from clonal, isogenic, naïve, 
primary murine CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes. The analysis reveals that discrete 
nucleosomes exhibit cell type-specific occupancy and positioning depending on 
differentiation status and transcription. This method is widely applicable to 
mapping many features of chromatin and discerning its landscape in large genomes 
at unprecedented resolution.
