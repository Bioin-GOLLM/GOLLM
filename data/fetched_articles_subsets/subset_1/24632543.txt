PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Understanding the effects of in-utero exposures to 
environmental agents is of great importance as the resulting deregulation of 
biological processes can affect both fetal development and health outcomes that 
manifest later in life. Due to their established role in developmental processes 
and inherent stability ex vivo, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as attractive 
candidates to explore the impact of such exposures during this critical window 
of susceptibility. In this review, we summarize the findings of studies 
assessing miRNAs as markers of in-utero environmental exposures and as 
candidates for the molecular basis through which these exposures exert their 
influence on children's health.
RECENT FINDINGS: To date, miRNA expression profiles due to various in-utero 
environmental exposures, including xenochemicals, endogenous factors, and 
nutritional status, have been reported.
SUMMARY: While the validity of the identified exposure-specific miRNA profiles 
remains to be established, the findings thus far do raise interesting questions 
worth addressing in future studies. Gaps that remain to be addressed include 
linking specific in-utero exposures to subsequent health outcomes based on 
established miRNA expression profiles and experimentally validating putative 
downstream targets of the deregulated miRNAs.
