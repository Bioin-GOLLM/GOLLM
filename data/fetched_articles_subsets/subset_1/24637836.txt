The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is an enormous proteinaceous complex composed of 
multiple copies of about 30 different proteins called nucleoporins. In this 
study, we analyzed the composition of the NPC in the model organism 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe using strains in which individual nucleoporins were 
tagged with GFP. We identified 31 proteins as nucleoporins by their localization 
to the nuclear periphery. Gene disruption analysis in previous studies coupled 
with gene disruption analysis in the present study indicates that 15 of these 
nucleoporins are essential for vegetative cell growth and the other 16 
nucleoporins are non-essential. Among the 16 non-essential nucleoporins, 11 are 
required for normal progression through meiosis and their disruption caused 
abnormal spore formation or poor spore viability. Based on fluorescence 
measurements of GFP-fused nucleoporins, we estimated the composition of the NPC 
in S. pombe and found that the organization of the S. pombe NPC is largely 
similar to that of other organisms; a single NPC was estimated as being 
45.8-47.8 MDa in size. We also used fluorescence measurements of single NPCs and 
quantitative western blotting to analyze the composition of the Nup107-Nup160 
subcomplex, which plays an indispensable role in NPC organization and function. 
Our analysis revealed low amounts of Nup107 and Nup131 and high amounts of 
Nup132 in the Nup107-Nup160 subcomplex, suggesting that the composition of this 
complex in S. pombe may differ from that in S. cerevisiae and humans. 
Comparative analysis of NPCs in various organisms will lead to a comprehensive 
understanding of the functional architecture of the NPC.
