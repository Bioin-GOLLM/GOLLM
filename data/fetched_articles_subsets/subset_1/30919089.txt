PURPOSE: Developing and testing of microbicides for pre-exposure prophylaxis and 
post-exposure protection from HIV are on the list of major HIV/AIDS research 
priorities. To improve solubility and bioavailability of highly potent 
anti-retroviral drugs, we explored the use of a nanoparticle (NP) for 
formulating a combination of two water-insoluble HIV inhibitors.
METHODS: The combination of a non-nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NNRTI), Efavirenz (EFV), and an inhibitor of HIV integrase, Elvitegravir (ELV) 
was stabilized with a graft copolymer of methoxypolyethylene glycol-polylysine 
with a hydrophobic core (HC) composed of fatty acids (HC-PGC). Formulations were 
tested in TZM-bl cells infected either with wild-type HIV-1IIIB, or 
drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. In vivo testing of double-labeled NP formulations 
was performed in female rats after a topical intravaginal administration using 
SPECT/CT imaging and fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: We observed a formation of stable 23-30 nm NP with very low 
cytotoxicity when EFV and ELV were combined with HC-PGC at a 1:10 weight ratio. 
For NP containing ELV and EFV (at 1:1 by weight) we observed a remarkable 
improvement of EC50 of EFV by 20 times in the case of A17 strain. In vivo 
imaging and biodistribution showed in vivo presence of NP components at 24 and 
48 h after administration, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: insoluble orthogonal inhibitors of HIV-1 life cycle may be 
formulated into the non-aggregating ultrasmall NP which are highly efficient 
against NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 variant.
