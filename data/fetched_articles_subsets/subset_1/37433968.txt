The development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves central and peripheral 
immune deregulation. Gene identification and studies of AD genetic variants of 
peripheral immune components may aid understanding of peripheral-central immune 
crosstalk and facilitate new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. In this 
study, we have identified in a Flanders-Belgian family a novel variant p.E317D 
in the Toll-like receptor 9 gene (TLR9), co-segregating with EOAD in an 
autosomal dominant manner. In human, TLR9 is an essential innate and adaptive 
immune component predominantly expressed in peripheral immune cells. The p.E317D 
variant caused 50% reduction in TLR9 activation in the NF-κB luciferase assay 
suggesting that p.E317D is a loss-of-function mutation. Cytokine profiling of 
human PBMCs upon TLR9 activation revealed a predominantly anti-inflammatory 
response in contrast to the inflammatory responses from TLR7/8 activation. The 
cytokines released upon TLR9 activation suppressed inflammation and promoted 
phagocytosis of Aβ42 oligomers in human iPSC-derived microglia. Transcriptome 
analysis identified upregulation of AXL, RUBICON and associated signaling 
pathways, which may underline the effects of TLR9 signaling-induced cytokines in 
regulating the inflammatory status and phagocytic property of microglia. Our 
data suggest a protective role of TLR9 signaling in AD pathogenesis, and we 
propose that TLR9 loss-of-function may disrupt a peripheral-central immune 
crosstalk that promotes dampening of inflammation and clearance of toxic protein 
species, leading to the build-up of neuroinflammation and pathogenic protein 
aggregates in AD development.
