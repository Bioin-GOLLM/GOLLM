GSK3β binding of GSKIP affects neurite outgrowth, but the physiological 
significance of PKA binding to GSKIP remains to be determined. We hypothesized 
that GSKIP and GSK3β mediate cAMP/PKA/Drp1 axis signaling and modulate 
mitochondrial morphology by forming a working complex comprising 
PKA/GSKIP/GSK3β/Drp1. We demonstrated that GSKIP wild-type overexpression 
increased phosphorylation of Drp1 S637 by 7-8-fold compared to PKA 
kinase-inactive mutants (V41/L45) and a GSK3β binding-defective mutant (L130) 
under H2O2 and forskolin challenge in HEK293 cells, indicating that not only 
V41/L45, but also L130 may be involved in Drp1-associated protection of GSKIP. 
Interestingly, silencing either GSKIP or GSK3β but not GSK3α resulted in a 
dramatic decrease in Drp1 S637 phosphorylation, revealing that both GSKIP and 
GSK3β are required in this novel PKA/GSKIP/GSK3β/Drp1 complex. Moreover, 
overexpressed kinase-dead GSK3β-K85R, which retains the capacity to bind GSKIP, 
but not K85M which shows total loss of GSKIP-binding, has a higher Drp1 S637 
phosphorylation similar to the GSKIP wt overexpression group, indicating that 
GSK3β recruits Drp1 by anchoring rather than in a kinase role. With further 
overexpression of either V41/L45P or the L130P GSKIP mutant, the elongated 
mitochondrial phenotype was lost; however, ectopically expressed Drp1 S637D, a 
phosphomimetic mutant, but not S637A, a non-phosphorylated mutant, restored the 
elongated mitochondrial morphology, indicating that Drp1 is a downstream 
effector of direct PKA signaling and possibly has an indirect GSKIP function 
involved in the cAMP/PKA/Drp1 signaling axis. Collectively, our data revealed 
that both GSKIP and GSK3β function as anchoring proteins in the cAMP/PKA/Drp1 
signaling axis modulating Drp1 phosphorylation.
