Here, we investigated novel interactions of three global regulators of the 
network that controls biofilm formation in the model bacterium Escherichia coli 
using computational network analysis, an in vivo reporter assay and 
physiological validation experiments. We were able to map critical nodes that 
govern planktonic to biofilm transition and identify 8 new regulatory 
interactions for CRP, IHF or Fis responsible for the control of the promoters of 
rpoS, rpoE, flhD, fliA, csgD and yeaJ. Additionally, an in vivo promoter 
reporter assay and motility analysis revealed a key role for IHF as a repressor 
of cell motility through the control of FliA sigma factor expression. This 
investigation of first stage and mature biofilm formation indicates that biofilm 
structure is strongly affected by IHF and Fis, while CRP seems to provide a 
fine-tuning mechanism. Taken together, the analysis presented here shows the 
utility of combining computational and experimental approaches to generate a 
deeper understanding of the biofilm formation process in bacteria.
