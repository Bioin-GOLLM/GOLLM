OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic association of miR-146a gene polymorphisms 
at loci rs2910164 G/C, rs57095329 A/G, and rs6864584 T/C in patients with 
Kawasaki disease (KD) and coronary artery lesions (CAL).
METHODS: There were 120 patients with KD and 126 healthy subjects in this study. 
The genotype of loci rs2910164 G/C, rs57095329 A/G, and rs6864584 T/C of 
miR-146a gene were detected by polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing.
RESULTS: For miR-146a gene polymorphisms at loci rs2910164 G/C, rs57095329 A/G, 
and rs6864584 T/C, there were no significant difference of genotype frequencies 
and allele frequencies between KD group and healthy control group, or between 
the IVIG-resistant group and IVIG-sensitive group (P > 0.05). In KD with 
coronary artery lesions (KD-CAL) group, the genotype frequencies of GG were 
higher than that in KD without coronary artery lesion (KD-WO) group at locus 
rs2910164 G/C polymorphisms of miR-146a gene (χ2 = 6.660, P = 0.036), patients 
with KD carried genotype of GG were at 3.636 times higher risk of getting 
coronary artery lesions than those of non-carriers (χ2 = 6.455, P = 0.018, 
OR = 3.636, 95%CI = 1.280-10.262). While there was no significant difference of 
allele frequency of G and C between KD-CAL group and KD-WO group (P > 0.05). In 
KD-CAL group, the allele frequency of A was higher than that in KD-WO group at 
locus rs57095329 A/G polymorphisms of miR-146a gene (χ2 = 4.745, P = 0.035), 
carriers with allele A were at 2.422 times higher risk of getting coronary 
artery lesions than those of non-carriers (χ2 = 4.745, P = 0.035, OR = 2.422, 
95%CI = 1.073-5.465), while there was no significant difference of genotype 
frequency of AA, AG, and GG types between KD-CAL group and KD-WO group 
(P > 0.05). There was no significant difference of genotype frequencies of TT, 
TC, and CC types and allele frequencies of T and C types between KD-CAL group 
and KD-WO group at locus rs6864584 T/C polymorphisms of miR-146a gene 
(P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The significant association has been found between the genotype and 
allele frequency of the miR-146a gene loci rs2910164 G/C and rs57095329 A/G, the 
genotype GG of rs2910164 G/C, and allele A of rs57095329 A/G were risk factors 
for getting coronary artery lesions.
