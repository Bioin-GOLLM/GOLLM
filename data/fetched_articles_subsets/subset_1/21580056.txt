The title compound, C(18)H(19)NO, was synthesized from the multi-component 
one-pot reaction between p-toluidine, benzaldehyde and 2,3-dihydro-furan in the 
presence of palladium dichloride. There are two mol-ecules in the asymmetric 
unit. The crystal packing is stabilized by classical inter-molecular N-Hâ‹¯O 
hydrogen bonds.
