AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlations between 
thrombophilic mutations, anticoagulant activity and hemolysis, elevated liver 
functions and low thrombocyte count (HELLP) syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five healthy pregnant women (control group) and 34 
patients with HELLP syndrome (study group) were included in the study between 
April 2007 and January 2008. Homocysteine levels and activities of protein C, 
protein S and antithrombin III of the groups were compared. Frequency of factor 
V Leiden mutation, prothrombin 20210A mutation and C677 T mutation of 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene were also compared.
RESULTS: Frequencies of thrombophilic gene mutations of the two groups were not 
significantly different. Homocysteine levels were significantly higher in the 
study group. Protein C and protein S deficiencies of the two groups were 
similar. Antithrombin III deficiency was statistically higher in the patients 
with HELLP syndrome.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of antithrombin III deficiency and homocysteine levels 
were higher in the patients with HELLP syndrome; however, there was no positive 
relationship between hereditary thrombophilic mutations and the disease. Larger 
prospective studies are needed to validate our findings.
