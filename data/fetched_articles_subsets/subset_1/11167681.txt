BACKGROUND: A distinctive subtype of epidermolysis bullosa simplex, with the 
additional feature of mottled pigmentation (EBS-MP), was initially characterized 
in a Swedish family in 1979, and seven further families have been reported. 
Features of EBS-MP that are observed in most affected patients include acral 
blistering early in childhood, mottled pigmentation distributed in a number of 
sites, focal punctate hyperkeratoses of the palms and soles, and dystrophic, 
thickened nails. The genetic basis of EBS-MP has been ascribed in five unrelated 
families to a heterozygous point mutation, P25L, in the non-helical V1 domain of 
K5.
OBJECTIVES: We report a clinical, ultrastructural and molecular study of two of 
the earliest families to be clinically characterized as EBS-MP.
METHODS: The P25L mutation was identified in all affected members of each of 
these families, bringing the total number of EBS-MP families with this mutation 
to seven.
RESULTS: This unusual recurrent mutation may uniquely cause EBS-MP.
CONCLUSIONS: While the exact molecular mechanisms by which this mutation causes 
epidermolysis, palmoplantar keratoderma and pigmentation remain elusive, we 
suggest possible molecular mechanisms through which the P25L substitution could 
cause this unusual phenotype.
