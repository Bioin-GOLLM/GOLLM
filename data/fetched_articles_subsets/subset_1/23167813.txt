As an ever-growing number of genome sequences appear, it is becoming 
increasingly clear that factors other than genome sequence impart complexity to 
the proteome. Of the various sources of proteomic variability, 
post-translational modifications (PTMs) most greatly serve to expand the variety 
of proteins found in the cell. Likewise, modulating the rates at which different 
proteins are degraded also results in a constantly changing cellular protein 
profile. While both strategies for generating proteomic diversity are adopted by 
organisms across evolution, the responsible pathways and enzymes in Archaea are 
often less well described than are their eukaryotic and bacterial counterparts. 
Studies on halophilic archaea, in particular Haloferax volcanii, originally 
isolated from the Dead Sea, are helping to fill the void. In this review, recent 
developments concerning PTMs and protein degradation in the haloarchaea are 
discussed.
