CLN3 Batten disease (CLN3 disease) is a pediatric lysosomal storage disorder 
that presents with progressive blindness, motor and cognitive decline, seizures, 
and premature death. CLN3 disease results from mutations in CLN3 with the most 
prevalent mutation, a 966 bp deletion spanning exons 7-8, affecting ~ 75% of 
patients. Mouse models with complete Cln3 deletion or Cln3Δex7/8 mutation have 
been invaluable for learning about both the basic biology of CLN3 and the 
underlying pathological changes associated with CLN3 disease. These models, 
however, vary in their disease presentation and are limited in their utility for 
studying the role of nonsense mediated decay, and as a consequence, in testing 
nonsense suppression therapies and read-through compounds. In order to develop a 
model containing a disease-causing nonsense point mutation, here we describe a 
first-of-its-kind Cln3Q352X mouse model containing a c.1054C > T (p.Gln352Ter) 
point mutation. Similar to previously characterized Cln3 mutant mouse lines, 
this novel model shows pathological deficits throughout the CNS including 
accumulation of lysosomal storage material and glial activation, and has limited 
perturbation in behavioral measures. Thus, at the molecular and cellular level, 
this mouse line provides a valuable tool for testing nonsense suppression 
therapies or read through compounds in CLN3 disease in the future.
