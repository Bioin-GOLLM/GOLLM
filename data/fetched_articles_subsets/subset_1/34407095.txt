BACKGROUND: Adipokine leptin plays a crucial role in metabolic and reproductive 
functions. Leptin receptor has a soluble form that binds to leptin, thus 
modulating its level in the circulation. It has been indicated that the levels 
of leptin and leptin receptor and also LEP rs7799039 and LEPR rs1137101 
polymorphisms are associated with metabolic disorders. In the present study, we 
assessed the levels of leptin and soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), and also the 
frequency of rs7799039 and rs1137101 polymorphisms in healthy fertile women and 
patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), inclusive of PCOS-infertile and 
PCOS-recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) subjects.
METHODS: A total of 324 PCOS patients- including 199 infertile cases and 125 
patients with a history of RPL- and 144 healthy controls were enrolled in this 
study. Biochemical parameters and plasma leptin and sOB-R levels were measured 
by ELISA and the genotypes of rs7799039 and rs1137101 polymorphisms were 
determined using PCR- RFLP.
RESULTS: Plasma leptin and sOB-R levels were significantly higher and lower in 
PCOS, PCOS-infertile and PCOS RPL groups, respectively. The GG genotype 
frequencies of rs7799039 and rs1137101 polymorphisms were significantly 
different between PCOS-infertile women and non-PCOS subjects (P = 0.043, OR = 
0.47, 95% CI = 0.22-0.97, and P = 0.01, OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.12-0.75, 
respectively). Increased LEP levels were associated with the risk of PCOS and 
RPL in women with PCOS (P = 0.039, OR = 1.203, 95%CI = [1.009-1.435] and P = 
0.012, OR = 1.267, 95% CI = [1.054-1.522], respectively).
CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms rs7799039 and rs1137101 and circulating leptin and 
sOB-R levels were associated with infertility in Iranian women with PCOS. 
Further studies are needed to reveal the role of leptin in PCOS pathogenesis.
