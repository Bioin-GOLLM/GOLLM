Blood isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi from two recently returned 
Bangladeshi patients in Kuwait were ciprofloxacin resistant, with ciprofloxacin 
MICs of 12 mg/liter for both isolates. Both isolates had three novel gyrA 
mutations (55-Leu-->Trp, 87-Asp-->Ala, and 106-Gln-->Arg) and three novel parC 
mutations (84-Glu-->Lys, 106-Trp-->Gly, and 128-Tyr-->Asp).
