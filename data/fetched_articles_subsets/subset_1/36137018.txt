The vertebrate intestine forms by asymmetric gut rotation and elongation, and 
errors cause lethal obstructions in human infants. Rotation begins with tissue 
deformation of the dorsal mesentery, which is dependent on left-sided expression 
of the Paired-like transcription factor Pitx2. The conserved morphogen Nodal 
induces asymmetric Pitx2 to govern embryonic laterality, but organ-level 
regulation of Pitx2 during gut asymmetry remains unknown. We found Nodal to be 
dispensable for Pitx2 expression during mesentery deformation. Intestinal 
rotation instead required a mechanosensitive latent transforming growth factor-β 
(TGFβ), tuning a second wave of Pitx2 that induced reciprocal tissue stiffness 
in the left mesentery as mechanical feedback with the right side. This signaling 
regulator, an accelerator (right) and brake (left), combines biochemical and 
biomechanical inputs to break gut morphological symmetry and direct intestinal 
rotation.
