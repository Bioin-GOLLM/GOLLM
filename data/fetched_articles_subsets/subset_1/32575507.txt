Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is a secreted glycoprotein linked to several physiological 
roles, including transporting hydrophobic ligands across cell membranes, 
modulating immune responses, maintaining iron homeostasis, and promoting 
epithelial cell differentiation. Although LNC2 is expressed at low levels in 
most human tissues, it is abundant in aggressive subtypes of cancer, including 
breast, pancreas, thyroid, ovarian, colon, and bile duct cancers. High levels of 
LCN2 have been associated with increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell 
invasion, and metastasis. Moreover, LCN2 modulates the degradation, allosteric 
events, and enzymatic activity of matrix metalloprotease-9, a metalloprotease 
that promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Hence, LCN2 has emerged as a 
potential therapeutic target against many cancer types. This review summarizes 
the most relevant findings regarding the expression, biological roles, and 
regulation of LCN2, as well as the proteins LCN2 interacts with in cancer. We 
also discuss the approaches to targeting LCN2 for cancer treatment that are 
currently under investigation, including the use of interference RNAs, 
antibodies, and gene editing.
