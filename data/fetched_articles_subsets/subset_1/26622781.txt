The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in the quality control of secreted 
protein via promoting the correct folding of nascent protein and mediating the 
degradation of unfolded or misfolded protein, namely ER-associated degradation. 
When the unfolded or misfolded proteins are abundant, the unfolded protein 
response (UPR) is elicited, an adaptive signaling cascade from the ER to the 
nucleus, which restores the homeostatic functions of the ER. Autophagy is a 
conserved catabolic process where cellular long-lived proteins and damaged 
organelles are engulfed and degraded for recycling to maintain homeostasis. The 
UPR and autophagy occur simultaneously and are involved in pathological 
processes, including tumorigenesis, chemoresistance of malignancies and 
neurodegeneration. Accumulative data has indicated that the UPR may induce 
autophagy and that autophagy is able to alleviate the UPR. However, the detailed 
mechanism of interplay between autophagy and UPR remains to be fully understood. 
The present review aimed to depict the core pathways of the two processes and to 
elucidate how autophagy and UPR are regulated. Moreover, the review also 
discusses the molecular mechanism of crosstalk between the UPR and autophagy and 
their roles in malignant survival and drug resistance.
