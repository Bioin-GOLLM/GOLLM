INTRODUCTION: As a member of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) gene family, BCL-2 
associated X (BAX) is important for cell apoptosis. In this work, we 
investigated the association of BAX promoter DNA methylation with coronary heart 
disease (CHD) in Han Chinese.
METHODS: A SYBR green-based quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) was 
used to test BAX methylation levels in 959 CHD cases and 514 controls.
RESULTS: Although BAX methylation was not associated with CHD in the total 
samples, further breakdown analysis by age showed that BAX hypermethylation was 
significantly associated with CHD for individuals aged over 70 (median 
percentage of methylation ratio [PMR], 10.70% in cases versus (vs) 2.25% in 
controls, P =.046). Moreover, BAX methylation was associated with smoking and 
lipoprotein A (Lp(a)) for individuals aged over 70 (CHD: smoking P = .012, Lp(a) 
P = .001; non-CHD: smoking P = .051, Lp(a) P = .004). Further analysis of Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data showed BAX 
expression was upregulated by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine demethylation agent 
(fold = 1.66, P = .038) and inversely correlated with BAX methylation 
(r = -0.428, P = 8E-05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study supported that BAX hypermethylation might contribute to 
CHD risk via downregulation of BAX expression for individuals aged over 70.
