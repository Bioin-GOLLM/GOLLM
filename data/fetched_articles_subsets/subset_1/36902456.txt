The standard of care for most malignant solid tumors still involves tumor 
resection followed by chemo- and radiation therapy, hoping to eliminate the 
residual tumor cells. This strategy has been successful in extending the life of 
many cancer patients. Still, for primary glioblastoma (GBM), it has not 
controlled recurrence or increased the life expectancies of patients. Amid such 
disappointment, attempts to design therapies using the cells in the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) have gained ground. Such "immunotherapies" have so far 
overwhelmingly used genetic modifications of Tc cells (Car-T cell therapy) or 
blocking of proteins (PD-1 or PD-L1) that inhibit Tc-cell-mediated cancer cell 
elimination. Despite such advances, GBM has remained a "Kiss of Death" for most 
patients. Although the use of innate immune cells, such as the microglia, 
macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, has been considered in designing 
therapies for cancers, such attempts have not reached the clinic yet. We have 
reported a series of preclinical studies highlighting strategies to "re-educate" 
GBM-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs) so that they assume a 
tumoricidal status. Such cells then secrete chemokines to recruit activated, 
GBM-eliminating NK cells and cause the rescue of 50-60% GBM mice in a syngeneic 
model of GBM. This review discusses a more fundamental question that most 
biochemists harbor: "since we are generating mutant cells in our body all the 
time, why don't we get cancer more often?" The review visits publications 
addressing this question and discusses some published strategies for 
re-educating the TAMs to take on the "sentry" role they initially maintained in 
the absence of cancer.
