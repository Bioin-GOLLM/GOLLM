According to statistics, lung cancer kills 1.8 million people each year and is 
the main cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
accounts for over 85% of all lung cancers. Lung cancer has a strong genetic 
predisposition, demonstrating that the susceptibility and survival of lung 
cancer are related to specific genes. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
and next-generation sequencing have been used to discover genes related to 
NSCLC. However, many studies ignored the intricate interaction information 
between gene pairs. In the paper, we proposed a novel deep learning method named 
Deep-LC for predicting NSCLC-related genes. First, we built a gene interaction 
network and used graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract features of 
genes and interactions between gene pairs. Then a simple convolutional neural 
network (CNN) module is used as the decoder to decide whether the gene is 
related to the disease. Deep-LC is an end-to-end method, and from the evaluation 
results, we can conclude that Deep-LC performs well in mining potential 
NSCLC-related genes and performs better than existing state-of-the-art methods.
