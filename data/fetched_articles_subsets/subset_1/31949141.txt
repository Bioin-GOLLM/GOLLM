Biological processes in development and disease are controlled by the abundance, 
localization and modification of cellular proteins. We have developed versatile 
tools based on recombinant E3 ubiquitin ligases that are controlled by light or 
drug induced heterodimerization for nanobody or DARPin targeted depletion of 
endogenous proteins in cells and organisms. We use this rapid, tunable and 
reversible protein depletion for functional studies of essential proteins like 
PCNA in DNA repair and to investigate the role of CED-3 in apoptosis during 
Caenorhabditis elegans development. These independent tools can be combined for 
spatial and temporal depletion of different sets of proteins, can help to 
distinguish immediate cellular responses from long-term adaptation effects and 
can facilitate the exploration of complex networks.
