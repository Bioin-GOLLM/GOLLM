We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between the 
functional IL-1β+3954 (C/T), IL-6-174 (G/C), IL-10-1082 (G/A), and IL-10-819C/T 
genetic polymorphisms and risk of recurrent oral ulceration (ROU) in a Chinese 
population. Polymorphisms of IL-1β+3954C/T, IL-6-174G/C, IL-10-1082A/G and 
IL-10-819C/T were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment 
length polymorphism. The genotype distributions of the IL-1β+3954 C/T and 
IL-10-819C/T were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group. 
Conditional logistic regression analyses showed that subjects carrying the 
IL-1β+3954CC and IL-10-1082AA genotypes had a significantly increased risk of 
ROU, with adjusted ORs (95%CI) of 2.86 (1.37-6.33) and 1.72 (1.02-2.89), 
respectively. In summary, we found that IL-1β+3954C/T and IL-10-1082A/G 
polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of ROU.
