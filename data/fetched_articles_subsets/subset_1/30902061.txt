BACKGROUND: Synaptic damage precedes neuron death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Neurexins, NRXN1, NRXN2, and NRXN3, are presynaptic adhesion molecules that 
specify neuron synapses and regulate neurotransmitter release. Neurexins and 
postsynaptic neuroligins interact with amyloid beta oligomer (AβO) deposits in 
damaged synapses. NRXN3 gene variants have been associated with autism, 
addiction, and schizophrenia, however, not fully investigated in Alzheimer's 
disease. In the present study, we investigated an AD association of a 
3'-splicing allele of rs8019381 that produces altered expression of 
transmembrane or soluble NRXN3 isoforms.
METHODS: We carried out RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction), PCR-RFLP (PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism), Sanger 
sequencing, and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays for NRXN3 neuron expression 
and genotyping. Genetic associations were analyzed by χ2 tests, and ISH signals 
were analyzed by FISH v1.0 module of Indica Labs HALO software.
RESULTS: We previously identified a functional haplotype in the 3' region of 
neurexin 3 (NRXN3) gene that alters the expression ratios between NRXN3 
transmembrane and soluble isoforms. In this study, we found that expression and 
ratio of transmembrane and soluble NRXN3 isoforms were reduced in AD postmortem 
brains and inversely correlated with inflammasome component NLRP3 in AD brain 
regions. The splicing haplotype related to the transmembrane and soluble NRXN3 
expression was associated with AD samples with P = 6.3 × 10-5 (odds 
ratio = 2.48) and interacted with APOE genotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the SNP rs8019381 of NRXN3 that is located adjacent 
to splicing site #5 (SS#5) interacts with the APOE ε4 haplotype and alters NRXN3 
transmembrane or soluble isoform expression in AD postmortem cortex. 
Dysregulation of presynaptic NRXN3 expression and splicing might increase neuron 
inflammation in AD brain.
