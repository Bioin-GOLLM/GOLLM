OBJECTIVE: Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) has recently been reported as a marker 
of cancer stem-like cells in ovarian cancer. However, the prognostic role of 
ALDH in ovarian cancer still remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to 
evaluate the association between the expression of ALDH and the outcome of 
ovarian cancer patients by performing a meta-analysis.
METHODS: We systematically searched for studies investigating the relationships 
between ALDH expression and outcome of ovarian cancer patients. Only articles in 
which ALDH expression was detected by immunohistochemical staining were 
included. A meta-analysis was performed to generate combined hazard ratios (HRs) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free 
survival (DFS).
RESULTS: A total of 1,258 patients from 7 studies (6 articles) were included in 
the analysis. Our results showed that high ALDH expression in patients with 
ovarian cancer was associated with poor prognosis in terms of Os (HR, 1.25; 95% 
CI, 1.07-1.47; P = 0.005) and DFS (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.00-2.49; P = 0.052), 
though the difference for DFS was not statistically significant. In addition, 
there was no evidence of publication bias as suggested by Begg's and Egger's 
tests (Begg's test, P = 0.707; Egger's test, P = 0.355).
CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis indicated that elevated ALDH expression 
was associated with poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer.
