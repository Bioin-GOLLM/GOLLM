MOTIVATION: Protein-protein interaction (PPI), as a relative property, is 
determined by two binding proteins, which brings a great challenge to design an 
expert model with an unbiased learning architecture and a superior 
generalization performance. Additionally, few efforts have been made to allow 
PPI predictors to discriminate between relative properties and intrinsic 
properties.
RESULTS: We present a sequence-based approach, DeepTrio, for PPI prediction 
using mask multiple parallel convolutional neural networks. Experimental 
evaluations show that DeepTrio achieves a better performance over several 
state-of-the-art methods in terms of various quality metrics. Besides, DeepTrio 
is extended to provide additional insights into the contribution of each input 
neuron to the prediction results.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We provide an online application at 
http://bis.zju.edu.cn/deeptrio. The DeepTrio models and training data are 
deposited at https://github.com/huxiaoti/deeptrio.git.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics 
online.
