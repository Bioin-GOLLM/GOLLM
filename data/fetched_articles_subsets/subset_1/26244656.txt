The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays important roles in normal and 
cancer cell growth. The EGFR has principally two different signaling pathways: 
the canonical kinase route induced at the plasma membrane resulting in an 
intracellular phosphorylation cascade via MAPKs and PI3K and the more recently 
discovered pathway by which the receptor functions as a transcriptional 
co-activator inside the cell nucleus. Full length EGFR translocates to the inner 
nuclear membrane, via the endoplasmic reticulum, through association with the 
sec61β translocon. The c-myc (MYC) and cyclin D1 (CNND1) genes represent two 
target genes for nuclear EGFR (nEGFR). Here we show that EGFR is SUMOylated and 
that the SUMO-1-modified receptors are almost unexceptionally nuclear. 
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that EGFR is multi-SUMOylated. Using 
two mass spectrometry-based strategies (matrix-assisted laser desorption 
ionization time of flight and electrospray ionization liquid chromatography with 
tandem mass spectrometry), lysine 37 was identified as a SUMO-1-modified residue 
by both methods. A lysine 37 site mutant (K37R) was transfected into EGFR 
deficient cells. Total SUMOylation of EGFR was not altered in the 
K37R-transfected cells, confirming the presence of other SUMOylation sites. To 
gain preliminary insight into the possible functional role of EGFR SUMOylation, 
we compared the effect of expression of the wild-type EGFR with the K37R mutant 
on promoter activity and expression of CMYC and CNND1. Our results indicate that 
SUMO-1 modification may affect the transcriptional activity of EGFR, which might 
have additional impact on, e.g., cancer progression.
