Hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) regulates orthogonal MAP kinase 
signaling cascades by dephosphorylating both extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK) and p38. HePTP recognizes a docking site (D-recruitment site, DRS) 
on its targets using a conserved N-terminal sequence motif (D-motif). Using 
solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration 
calorimetry, we compare, for the first time, the docking interactions of HePTP 
with ERK2 and p38α. Our results demonstrate that ERK2-HePTP interactions 
primarily involve the D-motif, while a contiguous region called the kinase 
specificity motif also plays a key role in p38α-HePTP interactions. D-Motif-DRS 
interactions for the two kinases, while similar overall, do show some specific 
differences.
