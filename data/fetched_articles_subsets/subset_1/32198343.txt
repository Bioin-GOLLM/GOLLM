Breast cancer is the most common malignancy for women worldwide, while Triple 
Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% in all patients. Compared with 
estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, which could be effectively controlled 
via endocrine therapy, TNBC is more aggressive and worse in prognosis. It is 
therefore urgent and necessary to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for TNBC 
treatment. Recent studies identified Hippo signaling is highly activated in 
TNBC, which could be a driving pathway for TNBC progression. In our study, we 
determine RNF187 as a negative regulator for Hippo signaling activation. RNF187 
depletion significantly decreases cell migration and invasion capacity in TNBC. 
These effects could be rescued by further YAP depletion. Depletion of RNF187 
increases the YAP protein level and Hippo signaling target genes, such as CTGF 
and CYR61 in TNBC. Immuno-precipitation assay shows that RNF187 associates with 
YAP, promoting its degradation possibly via inducing YAP K48-dependent 
poly-ubiquitination. Interestingly, Our clinical data reveals that RNF187 
reversely correlates with YAP protein level and Hippo target genes. RNF187 tends 
to correlate with good prognosis in TNBC patients. Our study provides evidence 
to establish a proteolytic mechanism in regulation Hippo signaling activation in 
TNBC.
