Diurnal metabolic rhythms add an important temporal dimension to metabolic 
homeostasis in mammals. Although it remains a challenge to untangle the 
intricate networks of crosstalk among the body clock, nutrient signalling and 
tissue metabolism, there is little doubt that the rhythmic nature of nutrient 
and energy metabolism is a central aspect of metabolic physiology. Disruption of 
the synchrony between clock and metabolism has been causally linked to diverse 
pathophysiological states. As such, restoring the rhythmicity of body physiology 
and therapeutic targeting directed at specific time windows during the day may 
have important implications in human health and medicine. In this review, we 
summarize recent findings on the integration of hepatic glucose metabolism and 
the body clock through a regulatory network centred on the PPARγ coactivator 1 
(PGC-1) transcriptional coactivators. In addition, we discuss the 
transcriptional mechanisms underlying circadian control of the autophagy gene 
programme and autophagy in the liver.
