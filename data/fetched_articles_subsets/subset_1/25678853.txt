MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as fundamental post-transcriptional 
regulators inhibit gene expression linked to various biological processes. 
MiR-206 is one of the most studied and best characterized miRNA to date, which 
specifically expressed in skeletal muscle. In this review, we summarized the 
results of studies of miR-206 with emphasis on its function in skeletal muscle 
development. Importantly, dysregulation of miR-206 has been linked to many 
disorders in skeletal muscle such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and circulating miR-206 has highlighted its 
potential as a diagnose biomarker. In addition, a mutation in the 3' 
untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the myostatin gene in the Texel sheep creating a 
target site for the miR-206 and miR-1 leads to inhibition of myostatin 
expression, which likely to cause the muscular hypertrophy phenotype of this 
breed of sheep. Therefore, miR-206 may become novel target for ameliorating 
skeletal muscle-related disorders and optimization of muscle quantity of 
domestic animals.
