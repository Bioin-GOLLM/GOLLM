POU3F3, also referred to as Brain-1, is a well-known transcription factor 
involved in the development of the central nervous system, but it has not 
previously been associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder. Here, we report 
the identification of 19 individuals with heterozygous POU3F3 disruptions, most 
of which are de novo variants. All individuals had developmental delays and/or 
intellectual disability and impairments in speech and language skills. Thirteen 
individuals had characteristic low-set, prominent, and/or cupped ears. Brain 
abnormalities were observed in seven of eleven MRI reports. POU3F3 is an 
intronless gene, insensitive to nonsense-mediated decay, and 13 individuals 
carried protein-truncating variants. All truncating variants that we tested in 
cellular models led to aberrant subcellular localization of the encoded protein. 
Luciferase assays demonstrated negative effects of these alleles on 
transcriptional activation of a reporter with a FOXP2-derived binding motif. In 
addition to the loss-of-function variants, five individuals had missense 
variants that clustered at specific positions within the functional domains, and 
one small in-frame deletion was identified. Two missense variants showed reduced 
transactivation capacity in our assays, whereas one variant displayed 
gain-of-function effects, suggesting a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. In 
bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) interaction assays, all the 
truncated POU3F3 versions that we tested had significantly impaired dimerization 
capacities, whereas all missense variants showed unaffected dimerization with 
wild-type POU3F3. Taken together, our identification and functional cell-based 
analyses of pathogenic variants in POU3F3, coupled with a clinical 
characterization, implicate disruptions of this gene in a characteristic 
neurodevelopmental disorder.
