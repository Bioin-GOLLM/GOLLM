BACKGROUND: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal-recessive lipid 
storage disorder caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene encoding the key enzyme 
in the bile acid synthesis, sterol 27-hydroxylase. Here, we report two Japanese 
CTX siblings with a novel compound heterozygous CYP27A1 mutation, showing 
different clinical phenotypes and responses to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) 
therapy.
CASE PRESENTATION: The proband, a 32-year-old man, who had chronic diarrhea, 
bilateral cataracts, and xanthomas, demonstrated progressive neurological 
manifestations including ataxia, and spastic paraplegia during a 5-year 
follow-up period despite normalization of serum cholestanol after initiation of 
CDCA treatment. He also exhibited cognitive decline although improvement had 
been observed at the beginning of treatment. Follow-up brain magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) revealed pronounced progressive atrophy in the cerebellum, in 
addition to expanding hyperintense lesions in the dentate nuclei, posterior limb 
of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncles, and inferior olives on T2-weighted 
images. In contrast, the two-year-younger sister of the proband presented with 
chronic diarrhea, cataracts, xanthomas, and intellectual disability but no other 
neurological symptoms at the time of diagnosis. CDCA treatment lead to 
improvement of cognitive function and there were no characteristic CTX-related 
MRI features during the follow-up period. The siblings shared a paternally 
inherited c.1420C > T mutation (p.Arg474Trp) and a maternally inherited novel 
c.1176_1177delGA mutation, predicting p.(Glu392Asp*20).
CONCLUSIONS: Our cases suggest that early diagnosis and subsequent initiation of 
CDCA treatment are crucial before the appearance of characteristic MRI findings 
and severe neurological manifestations related to CTX. Further studies are 
required to elucidate mechanisms responsible for the clinical diversity of CTX 
and prognostic factors for long-term outcomes following initiation of CDCA 
treatment.
