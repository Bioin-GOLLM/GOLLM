BACKGROUND: Obesity is often associated with inflammation in adipose tissue (AT) 
with release of mediators of atherogenesis. We postulated that it would be 
feasible to collect sufficient abdominal AT to quantify changes in a broad array 
of adaptive and innate mononuclear white cells in obese non-diabetic adults in 
response to a dipeptidyl protease inhibitor (DPP4i), known to inhibit activation 
of immune white cells.
METHODS: Adults 18-55 years-of-age were screened for abdominal obesity and 
insulin resistance or impaired glucose tolerance but without known inflammatory 
conditions. Twenty-one eligible participants consented for study and were 
randomized 3:1 to receive sitagliptin (DPP4i) at 100mg or matching placebo daily 
for 28 days. Abdominal AT collected by percutaneous biopsy and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell fractions were evaluated before and after treatment; plasma was 
stored for batch testing.
RESULTS: Highly sensitive C-reactive protein, a global marker of inflammation, 
was not elevated in the study population. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) type 3 
(ILC-3) in abdominal AT decreased with active treatment compared with placebo (p 
= 0.04). Other immune white cells in AT and peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
(PBMC) fractions did not change with treatment compared to placebo (p>0.05); 
although ILC-2 declined in PBMCs (p = 0.007) in the sitagliptin treatment group. 
Two circulating biomarkers of atherogenesis, interferon-inducible protein-10 
(IP-10) and sCD40L declined in plasma (p = 0.02 and p = 0.07, respectively) in 
the active treatment group, providing indirect validation of a net reduction in 
inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, two cell types of the innate lymphoid system, 
ILC-3 in AT and ILC-2 PBMCs declined during treatment and as did circulating 
biomarkers of atherogenesis. Changes in other immune cells were not 
demonstrable. The study showed that sufficient abdominal AT could be obtained to 
quantify white cells of both innate and adaptive immunity and to demonstrate 
changes during therapy with an immune inhibitor.
