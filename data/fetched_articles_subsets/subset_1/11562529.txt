Papillomaviruses contain a gene, E5, that encodes a short hydrophobic 
polypeptide that has transforming activity. E5 proteins bind to the 16 kDa 
subunit c (proteolipid) of the eukaryotic vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) and 
this binding is thought to disturb the V-ATPase and to be part of 
transformation. This link has been examined in the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. The E5 proteins from human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16, bovine 
papillomavirus (BPV) type 1, BPV-4 E5 and various mutants of E5 and the p12' 
polypeptide from human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I all bound to the S. 
cerevisiae subunit c (Vma3p) and could be found in vacuolar membranes. However, 
none affected the activity of the V-ATPase. In contrast, a dominant-negative 
mutant of Vma3p (E137G) inactivated the enzyme and gave the characteristic VMA 
phenotype. A hybrid V-ATPase containing a subunit c from Norway lobster also 
showed no disruption. Sedimentation showed that HPV-16 E5 was not part of the 
active V-ATPase. It is concluded that the binding of E5 and E5-related proteins 
to subunit c does not affect V-ATPase activity or function and it is proposed 
that the binding may be due to a chaperone function of subunit c.
