Liver cancer is the sixth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third 
dominant cause of cancer death worldwide. Ferroptosis is characterized as an 
iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, with accumulation of lipid 
peroxides to lethal amounts. Evidences have showed that ferroptosis is closely 
associated with HCC, but the mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this 
review, we mainly summarize the roles of several typical molecules as well as 
radiotherapy in regulating the ferroptosis process in HCC. Chances are that this 
review may help address specific issues in the treatment of HCC.
