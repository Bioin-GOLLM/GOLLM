INTRODUCTION: Alveolar macrophages that regulate the inflammatory response in 
lungs are the main target cell for the treatment of inflammatory pulmonary 
pathologies, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Yolk sac 
derived alveolar resident macrophages play an important role in the pulmonary 
inflammatory response. With regards to anti-inflammatory actions, lipoxin A4 
(LXA4) has been identified as an inflammatory "braking signal".
METHODS: In vivo, LXA4 (0.1 µg/mouse) was injected intraperitoneally after 
intratracheal (1 mg/kg) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration; flow cytometry 
was used to measure peripheral blood monocyte derived recruited macrophage and 
neutrophil numbers; resident alveolar macrophage was depleted by liposome 
clodronate; CXCL2, CCL2, MMP9 level was detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. In vitro, 
sorted resident macrophages (1×106) were cultured with LPS (1 μg/mL) and LXA4 
(100 nmol/mL) with or without BOC-2 (10 μM) for 24 h to gain a better 
understanding of the mechanisms of LXA4.
RESULTS: LXA4 inhibited tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β) production induced by LPS. LXA4 also mediated LPS-induced macrophage 
recruitment and showed that this was dependent on CCL2 secretion and release by 
resident macrophages. LXA4 protects lung tissue by inhibiting neutrophil 
recruitment, partly through the CXCL2/MMP-9 signaling pathway. CXCL2 and MMP-9 
are mainly expressed by resident macrophages and neutrophils, respectively. 
Finally, LXA4's beneficial effects were abrogated by BOC-2, an LXA4 receptor 
inhibitor.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LXA4 may be a promising therapy for 
preventing and treating ARDS.
