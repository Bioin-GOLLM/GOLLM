The title compound, C15H13NOS, is a chiral mol-ecule crystallized as a racemate, 
with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In each of the mol-ecules, the 
five-membered thia-zine ring has an envelope conformation, with the S atom 
forming the flap. In one mol-ecule, the angle between the two phenyl-ring planes 
is 82.77 (7)°, while in the other it is 89.12 (6)°. In the crystal, mol-ecules 
are linked into chains along the b-axis direction by C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds.
