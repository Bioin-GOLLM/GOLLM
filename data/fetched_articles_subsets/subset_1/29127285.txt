The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 binds to a guide RNA and cleaves 
double-stranded DNA with a sequence complementary to the RNA guide. The Cas9-RNA 
system has been harnessed for numerous applications, such as genome editing. 
Here we use high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) to visualize the 
real-space and real-time dynamics of CRISPR-Cas9 in action. HS-AFM movies 
indicate that, whereas apo-Cas9 adopts unexpected flexible conformations, 
Cas9-RNA forms a stable bilobed structure and interrogates target sites on the 
DNA by three-dimensional diffusion. These movies also provide real-time 
visualization of the Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage process. Notably, the Cas9 HNH 
nuclease domain fluctuates upon DNA binding, and subsequently adopts an active 
conformation, where the HNH active site is docked at the cleavage site in the 
target DNA. Collectively, our HS-AFM data extend our understanding of the action 
mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9.
