Excitatory amino acid transporters can maintain extracellular glutamate 
concentrations lower than neurotoxic levels by transferring neurotransmitters 
from the synaptic cleft into surrounding glial cells and neurons. Previous work 
regarding the structural studies of Glt Ph , Glt TK , excitatory amino acid 
transporter 1 (EAAT1), EAAT3 and alanine serine cysteine transporter 2 described 
the transport mechanism of the glutamate transporter in depth. However, much 
remains unknown about the role of the loop between transmembrane segment 3 and 4 
during transport. To probe the function of this loop in the transport cycle, we 
engineered a pair of cysteine residues between the TM3-TM4 loop and TM7 in 
cysteine-less EAAT2. Here, we show that the oxidative cross-linking reagent CuPh 
inhibits transport activity of the paired mutant L149C/M414C, whereas DTT 
inhibits the effect of CuPh on transport activity of L149C/M414C. Additionally, 
we show that the effect of cross-linking in the mutant is due to the formation 
of the disulfide bond within the molecules of EAAT2. Further, L-glutamate or KCl 
protect, and D,L-threo-β-benzyloxy-aspartate (TBOA) increases, CuPh-induced 
inhibition in the L149C/M414 mutant, suggesting that the L149C and M414C 
cysteines are closer or farther away in the outward- or inward-facing 
conformations, respectively. Together, our findings provide evidence that the 
distance between TM3-TM4 loop and TM7 alter when substrates are transported.
