Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain condition marked by centrally mediated 
augmentation of pain and sensory processes. Skepticism has marked the history of 
this condition, but more recent study has identified neurobiological 
underpinnings supporting many of the symptoms associated with this condition. 
Early research in FM had unprecedented latitude within the rheumatology 
community to borrow heavily from theory and methods being applied in chronic 
pain research more generally. These insights facilitated rapid advances in FM 
research, not the least of which was the abandonment of a peripheral focus in 
favor of studying central mechanisms associated with central augmentation. 
Currently, rapid-paced discovery is taking place in FM genetics, patient 
assessment, new therapeutic targets, and novel methods of treatment delivery. 
Such insights are not likely to be limited in application just to FM and could 
have relevance to the broader field of pain research as well.
PERSPECTIVE: This manuscript reviews the history of FM and its diagnosis, 
evidence supporting central augmentation of pain in FM, potential mechanisms of 
central augmentation, current approaches to integrated care of FM, and areas of 
active collaboration between FM research and other chronic pain conditions.
