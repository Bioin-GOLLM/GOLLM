T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) proteins are cell-surface signaling 
receptors in T cells and scavenger receptors in antigen-presenting cells and 
kidney tubular epithelia. Here, we demonstrated a function for TIM proteins in 
mediating the degradation of NUR77, a nuclear receptor implicated in apoptosis 
and cell survival. TIM proteins interacted with and mediated the lysosomal 
degradation of NUR77 in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent pathway. We also 
showed dynamic cycling of TIM-1 to and from the cell surface through 
clathrin-dependent constitutive endocytosis. Blocking this process or mutating 
the phosphatidylserine-binding pocket in TIM-1 abrogated TIM-1-mediated 
degradation of NUR77. In an in vitro model of kidney injury, silencing TIM-1 
increased NUR77 abundance and decreased epithelial cell survival. These results 
show that TIM proteins may affect immune cell function and the response of the 
kidney to injury.
