Following prolonged exposure to hypoxic conditions, for example, due to ascent 
to high altitude, stroke, or traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema can develop. 
The exact nature and genesis of hypoxia-induced edema in healthy individuals 
remain unresolved. We examined the effects of prolonged, normobaric hypoxia, 
induced by 16 h of exposure to simulated high altitude, on healthy brains using 
proton, dynamic contrast enhanced, and sodium MRI. This dual approach allowed us 
to directly measure key factors in the development of hypoxia-induced brain 
edema: (1) Sodium signals as a surrogate of the distribution of electrolytes 
within the cerebral tissue and (2) Ktrans as a marker of blood-brain-barrier 
integrity. The measurements point toward an accumulation of sodium ions in 
extra- but not in intracellular space in combination with an intact endothelium. 
Both findings in combination are indicative of ionic extracellular edema, a 
subtype of cerebral edema that was only recently specified as an intermittent, 
yet distinct stage between cytotoxic and vasogenic edemas. In sum, here a 
combination of imaging techniques demonstrates the development of ionic edemas 
following prolonged normobaric hypoxia in agreement with cascadic models of 
edema formation.
