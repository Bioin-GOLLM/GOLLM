Genetic susceptibility may influence ischemic heart disease (IHD) predisposition 
and affect coronary blood flow (CBF) regulation mechanisms. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the association among single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) of genes encoding for proteins involved in CBF regulation and IHD. A 
total of 468 consecutive patients were enrolled and divided into three groups 
according to coronary angiography and intracoronary functional tests results: 
G1, patients with coronary artery disease (CAD); G2, patients with coronary 
microvascular dysfunction (CMD); and G3, patients with angiographic and 
functionally normal coronary arteries. A genetic analysis of the SNPs rs5215 of 
the potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 11 (KCNJ11) gene 
and rs1799983 of the nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) gene, respectively encoding 
for the Kir6.2 subunit of ATP sensitive potassium (KATP) channels and nitric 
oxide synthase (eNOS), was performed on peripheral whole blood samples. A 
significant association of rs5215_G/G of KCNJ11 and rs1799983_T/T of NOS3 genes 
was detected in healthy controls compared with CAD and CMD patients. Based on 
univariable and multivariable analyses, the co-presence of rs5215_G/G of KCNJ11 
and rs1799983_T/T of NOS3 may represent an independent protective factor against 
IHD, regardless of cardiovascular risk factors. This study supports the 
hypothesis that SNP association may influence the crosstalk between eNOS and the 
KATP channel that provides a potential protective effect against IHD.
