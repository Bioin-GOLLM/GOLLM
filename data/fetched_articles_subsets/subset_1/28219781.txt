While it is well known that adenosine receptor activation protects the heart 
from ischemia/reperfusion injury, the precise mitochondrial mechanism 
responsible for the action remains unknown. This study probed the mitochondrial 
events associated with the cardioprotective effect of 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido) 
adenosine (NECA), an adenosine A2 receptor agonist. Isolated rat hearts were 
subjected to 30min ischemia followed by 10min of reperfusion, whereas H9c2 cells 
experienced 20min ischemia and 10min reperfusion. NECA prevented mitochondrial 
structural damage, decreases in respiratory control ratio (RCR), and collapse of 
mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). Both the adenosine A2A receptor 
antagonist SCH58261 and A2B receptor antagonist MRS1706 inhibited the action of 
NECA. NECA reduced mitochondrial proteins carbonylation, H2O2, and superoxide 
generation at reperfusion, but did not change superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
activity. In support, the protective effects of NECA and Peg-SOD on ΔΨm upon 
reperfusion were additive, implying that NECA's protection is attributable to 
the reduced superoxide generation but not to the enhancement of the 
superoxide-scavenging capacity. NECA increased the mitochondrial Src tyrosine 
kinase activity and suppressed complex I activity at reperfusion in a 
Src-dependent manner. NECA also reduced mitochondrial superoxide through Src 
tyrosine kinase. Studies with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) 
identified Tyr118 of the NDUFV2 subunit of complex 1 as a likely site of the 
tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, the complex I activity of cells 
transfected with the Y118F mutant was increased, suggesting that this site might 
be a negative regulator of complex I activity. In support, NECA failed to 
suppress complex I activity at reperfusion in cells transfected with the Y118F 
mutant of NDUFV2. In conclusion, NECA prevents mitochondrial oxidative stress by 
decreasing mitochondrial superoxide generation through inhibition of complex I 
via the mitochondrial Src tyrosine kinase. Phosphorylation of Tyr118 residue in 
NDUFV2 subunit may account for the inhibitory effect of NECA on complex I.
