BACKGROUND: Based on associations between sleep spindles, cognition, and 
sleep-dependent memory processing, here we evaluated potential relationships 
between levels of CSF Aβ42, P-tau, and T-tau with sleep spindle density and 
other biophysical properties of sleep spindles in a sample of cognitively normal 
elderly individuals.
METHODS: One-night in-lab nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and morning to early 
afternoon CSF collection were performed to measure CSF Aβ42, P-tau and T-tau. 
Seven days of actigraphy were collected to assess habitual total sleep time.
RESULTS: Spindle density during NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep was negatively 
correlated with CSF Aβ42, P-tau and T-tau. From the three, CSF T-tau was the 
most significantly associated with spindle density, after adjusting for age, sex 
and ApoE4. Spindle duration, count and fast spindle density were also negatively 
correlated with T-tau levels. Sleep duration and other measures of sleep quality 
were not correlated with spindle characteristics and did not modify the 
associations between sleep spindle characteristics and the CSF biomarkers of AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced spindles during N2 sleep may represent an early dysfunction 
related to tau, possibly reflecting axonal damage or altered neuronal tau 
secretion, rendering it a potentially novel biomarker for early neuronal 
dysfunction. Given their putative role in memory consolidation and 
neuroplasticity, sleep spindles may represent a mechanism by which tau impairs 
memory consolidation, as well as a possible target for therapeutic interventions 
in cognitive decline.
