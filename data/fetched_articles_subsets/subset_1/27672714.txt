AIM: To explore the association between VDR polymorphisms and several 
cardiovascular risk factors and adiponectin.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Three-hundred and sixty-nine healthy students were randomly 
selected. Five VDR polymorphisms were genotyped: BsmI rs1544410; Cdx2 
rs11568820; ApaI rs7975232; TaqI rs731236 and FokI rs2228570. BMI, waist 
circumference (WC), blood pressure, lipid/glycemic profiles and adiponectin were 
assessed.
RESULTS: In men, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI were associated with BMI and WC (p < 0.05). 
FokI was associated with triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein levels (p = 
0.0036; p = 0.005) whereas BsmI and Cdx2 were associated with adiponectin levels 
(p = 0.026; p = 0.048). Associations disappeared after BMI and WC adjustments. 
In women, ApaI was associated with systolic blood pressure (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a gender-specific difference between VDR SNPs 
and various cardiovascular risk factors and adiponectin.
