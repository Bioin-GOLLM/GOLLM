Successful targeting of HER2-activating mutations in DESTINY-Lung02 phase II 
study has led to the approval of the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) trastuzumab 
deruxtecan (T-DXd) as second-line treatment in patients with non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). Despite the impressive results, several matters need to be 
addressed, including the clinical activity of T-DXd in patients with disease in 
the central nervous system as well as the role of T-DXd in the context of HER2 
overexpression. Additionally, data regarding novel agents used to target HER2 
continue to accumulate. This review highlights the challenges and unanswered 
questions that have emerged after the approval of T-DXd in patients with 
HER2-mutant NSCLC.
