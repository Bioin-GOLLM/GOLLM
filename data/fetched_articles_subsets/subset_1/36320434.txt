BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has resulted in acute respiratory 
distress, fatal systemic manifestations (extrapulmonary as well as pulmonary), 
and premature mortality among many patients. Therapy for COVID-19 has focused on 
the treatment of symptoms and of acute inflammation (cytokine storm) and the 
prevention of viral infection. Although the mechanism of COVID-19 is not fully 
understood, potential clinical targets have been identified for pharmacological, 
immunological, and vaccinal approaches.
AREA COVERED: Pharmacological approaches including drug repositioning have been 
a priority for initial COVID-19 therapy due to the time-consuming nature of the 
vaccine development process. COVID-19 drugs have been shown to manage the 
antiviral infection cycle (cell entry and replication of proteins and genomic 
RNA) and anti-inflammation. In this review, we evaluated the interaction of 
current COVID-19 drugs with two ATP-binding cassette transporters 
[P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)] and 
potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) among COVID-19 drugs, especially those 
associated with P-gp and BCRP efflux transporters.
EXPERT OPINION: Overall, understanding the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic DDIs 
of COVID-19 drugs can be useful for pharmacological therapy in COVID-19 
patients.
