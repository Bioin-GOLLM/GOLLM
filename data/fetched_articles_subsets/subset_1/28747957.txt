BACKGROUND: Airway epithelial cells are the first line of defense, against 
pathogens and environmental pollutants, in the lungs. Cellular stress by cadmium 
(Cd), resulting in airway inflammation, is assumed to be directly involved in 
tissue injury, linked to the development of lung cancer, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). We had earlier shown that ACN9 (chromosome 7q21), is a 
potential candidate gene for COPD, and identified significant interaction with 
smoking, based on genetic studies. However, the role of ACN9 in the inflammatory 
response, in the airway cells, has not yet been reported.
METHODS: We first checked the anatomical distribution of ACN9 in lung tissues, 
using mRNA in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Gene expression 
profiling in bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), was performed, after 
silencing ACN9. We further tested the roles of ACN9, in the intracellular 
mechanism, leading to Cd-induced production, of proinflammatory cytokines in 
BEAS-2B.
RESULTS: ACN9 was localized in lymphoid, and epithelial cells, of human lung 
tissues. ACN9 silencing, led to differential expression of 216 genes. Pathways 
of sensory perception to chemical stimuli, and cell surface receptor-linked 
signal transduction, were significantly enriched. ACN9 silencing, further 
increased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, in BEAS-2B after Cd 
exposure.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest, that ACN9 may have a role, in the inflammatory 
response in the airway.
