OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate perinatal imaging findings and to investigate the 
mutation in the NEK1 gene in a fetus with type III short rib-polydactyly 
syndrome (SRPS) (Verma-Naumoff).
CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old woman with no past history of fetal SRPS was referred 
to the hospital at 21 weeks of gestation because of sonographic diagnosis of 
short limbs in the fetus. Fetal ultrasound revealed a narrow thorax, short ribs, 
short limbs with marginal spurs, and postaxial hexadactyly in both the hands and 
feet. A diagnosis of SRPS III (Verma-Naumoff) was made. Amniocentesis was 
performed. The karyotype was 46,XY. Molecular genetic analysis of the amniotic 
fluid cells identified a homozygous splice site mutation in intron 4 (c.331-1 
A > G) or IVS4-1 A > G in the NEK1 gene. The parents were heterozygous for the 
mutation. The pregnancy was subsequently terminated and a malformed fetus was 
delivered with prominent forehead, a flattened nasal bridge, a narrow and short 
trunk, a protuberant abdomen, bilateral postaxial polydactyly and syndactyly of 
the hands and feet, and micromelic limbs. No facial cleft or genital abnormality 
was noted. The radiograph was consistent with SRPS III.
CONCLUSION: Polydactyly, micromelia, metaphyseal spurs, widened humeral 
metaphyses, and shortened ribs can be prominent prenatal ultrasound findings of 
SRPS III. The present case provides evidence for a correlation of a mutation in 
the NEK1 gene with SRPS III.
