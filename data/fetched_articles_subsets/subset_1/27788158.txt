The zero-tannin trait in lentil is controlled by a single recessive gene (tan) 
that results in a phenotype characterized by green stems, white flowers, and 
thin, transparent, or translucent seed coats. Genes that result in zero-tannin 
characteristics are useful for studies of seed coat pigmentation and biochemical 
characters because they have altered pigmentation. In this study, one of the 
major groups of plant pigments, phenolic compounds, was compared among 
zero-tannin and normal phenotypes and genotypes of lentil. Biochemical data were 
obtained by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Genomic sequencing 
was used to identify a candidate gene for the tan locus. Phenolic compound 
profiling revealed that myricetin, dihydromyricetin, flavan-3-ols, and 
proanthocyanidins are only detected in normal lentil phenotypes and not in 
zero-tannin types. The molecular analysis showed that the tan gene encodes a 
bHLH transcription factor, homologous to the A gene in pea. The results of this 
study suggest that tan as a bHLH transcription factor interacts with the 
regulatory genes in the biochemical pathway of phenolic compounds starting from 
flavonoid-3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H) and dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR).
