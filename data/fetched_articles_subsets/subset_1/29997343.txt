Background: We use a mobile software application (app) to measure for the first 
time, which fundamental characteristics of raw, natural medical Cannabis flower 
are associated with changes in perceived insomnia under naturalistic conditions. 
Methods: Four hundred and nine people with a specified condition of insomnia 
completed 1056 medical cannabis administration sessions using the Releaf AppTM 
educational software during which they recorded real-time ratings of 
self-perceived insomnia severity levels prior to and following consumption, 
experienced side effects, and product characteristics, including combustion 
method, cannabis subtypes, and/or major cannabinoid contents of cannabis 
consumed. Within-user effects of different flower characteristics were modeled 
using a fixed effects panel regression approach with standard errors clustered 
at the user level. Results: Releaf AppTM users showed an average symptom 
severity reduction of -4.5 points on a 0‚Åª10 point visual analogue scale (SD = 
2.7, d = 2.10, p < 0.001). Use of pipes and vaporizers was associated with 
greater symptom relief and more positive and context-specific side effects as 
compared to the use of joints, while vaporization was also associated with lower 
negative effects. Cannabidiol (CBD) was associated with greater statistically 
significant symptom relief than tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), but the cannabinoid 
levels generally were not associated with differential side effects. Flower from 
C. sativa plants was associated with more negative side effects than flower from 
C. indica or hybrid plant subtypes. Conclusions: Consumption of medical Cannabis 
flower is associated with significant improvements in perceived insomnia with 
differential effectiveness and side effect profiles, depending on the product 
characteristics.
