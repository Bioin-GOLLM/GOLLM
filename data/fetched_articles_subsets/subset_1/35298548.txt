BACKGROUND: Through continuous innovation and improvement, Nanopore sequencing 
has become a powerful technology. Because of its fast processing time, low cost, 
and ability to generate long reads, this sequencing technique would be 
particularly suitable for clinical diagnostics. However, its raw data accuracy 
is inferior in contrast to other sequencing technologies. This constraint still 
results in limited use of Nanopore sequencing in the field of clinical 
diagnostics and requires further validation and IVD certification.
METHODS: We evaluated the performance of latest Nanopore sequencing in 
combination with a dedicated data-analysis pipeline for single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) genotyping of the familial Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) by 
amplicon sequencing of 47 clinical samples. Mutations in MEFV are associated 
with Mediterranean fever, a hereditary periodic fever syndrome. Conventional 
Sanger sequencing, which is commonly applied in clinical genetic diagnostics, 
was used as a reference method.
RESULTS: Nanopore sequencing enabled the sequencing of 10 target regions within 
MEFV with high read depth (median read depth 7565x) in all samples and 
identified a total of 435 SNPs in the whole sample collective, of which 29 were 
unique. Comparison of both sequencing workflows showed a near perfect agreement 
with no false negative calls. Precision, Recall, and F1-Score of the Nanopore 
sequencing workflow were > 0.99, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated the great potential of current Nanopore 
sequencing for application in clinical diagnostics, at least for SNP genotyping 
by amplicon sequencing. Other more complex applications, especially structural 
variant identification, require further in-depth clinical validation.
