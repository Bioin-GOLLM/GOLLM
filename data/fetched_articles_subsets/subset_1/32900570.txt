The light-sensitive outer segment organelle of the vertebrate photoreceptor cell 
is a modified cilium filled with hundreds of flattened 'disc' membranes that 
provide vast light-absorbing surfaces. The outer segment is constantly renewed 
with new discs added at its base every day. This continuous process is essential 
for photoreceptor viability. In this review, we describe recent breakthroughs in 
the understanding of disc morphogenesis, with a focus on the molecular 
mechanisms responsible for initiating disc formation from the ciliary membrane. 
We highlight the discoveries that this mechanism evolved from an innate ciliary 
process of releasing small extracellular vesicles, or ectosomes, and that both 
disc formation and ectosome release rely on the actin cytoskeleton.
