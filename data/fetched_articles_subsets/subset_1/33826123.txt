Obesity and aging are two important epidemic factors for metabolic syndrome and 
many other health issues, which contribute to devastating diseases such as 
cardiovascular diseases, stroke and cancers. The brain plays a central role in 
controlling metabolic physiology in that it integrates information from other 
metabolic organs, sends regulatory projections and orchestrates the whole-body 
function. Emerging studies suggest that brain dysfunction in sensing various 
internal cues or processing external cues may have profound effects on metabolic 
and other physiological functions. This review highlights brain dysfunction 
linked to genetic mutations, sex, brain inflammation, microbiota, stress as 
causes for whole-body pathophysiology, arguing brain dysfunction as a root cause 
for the epidemic of aging and obesity-related disorders. We also speculate key 
issues that need to be addressed on how to reveal relevant brain dysfunction 
that underlines the development of these disorders and diseases in order to 
develop new treatment strategies against these health problems.
