Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus-1 (PBCV-1) is a large double-stranded DNA 
(dsDNA) virus that infects the unicellular green alga Chlorella variabilis 
NC64A. Unlike many other viruses, PBCV-1 encodes most, if not all, of the 
enzymes involved in the synthesis of the glycans attached to its major capsid 
protein. Importantly, these glycans differ from those reported from the three 
domains of life in terms of structure and asparagine location in the sequon of 
the protein. Previous data collected from 20 PBCV-1 spontaneous mutants (or 
antigenic variants) suggested that the a064r gene encodes a glycosyltransferase 
(GT) with three domains, each with a different function. Here, we demonstrate 
that: domain 1 is a β-l-rhamnosyltransferase; domain 2 is an 
α-l-rhamnosyltransferase resembling only bacterial proteins of unknown function, 
and domain 3 is a methyltransferase that methylates the C-2 hydroxyl group of 
the terminal α-l-rhamnose (Rha) unit. We also establish that methylation of the 
C-3 hydroxyl group of the terminal α-l-Rha is achieved by another virus-encoded 
protein A061L, which requires an O-2 methylated substrate. This study, thus, 
identifies two of the glycosyltransferase activities involved in the synthesis 
of the N-glycan of the viral major capsid protein in PBCV-1 and establishes that 
a single protein A064R possesses the three activities needed to synthetize the 
2-OMe-α-l-Rha-(1→2)-β-l-Rha fragment. Remarkably, this fragment can be attached 
to any xylose unit.
