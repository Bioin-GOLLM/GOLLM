BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy (MiP) remains a major public health challenge 
in areas of high malaria transmission. Intermittent preventive treatment in 
pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended to prevent 
the adverse consequences of MiP. The effectiveness of SP for IPTp may be reduced 
in areas where the dhps581 mutation (a key marker of high level SP resistance) 
is found; this mutation was previously reported to be common in the Tanga Region 
of northern Tanzania, but there are limited data from other areas. The frequency 
of molecular markers of SP resistance was investigated in malaria parasites from 
febrile patients at health centres (HC) in seven regions comprising the Lake and 
Southern Zones of mainland Tanzania as part of the ongoing efforts to generate 
national-wide data of SP resistance.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the outpatient departments of 
14 HCs in seven regions from April to June, 2015. 1750 dried blood spot (DBS) 
samples were collected (117 to 160 per facility) from consenting patients with 
positive rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, and no recent (within past 
2Â months) exposure to SP or related drugs. DNA was extracted from the DBS, 
pooled by HC, and underwent pooled targeted amplicon deep sequencing to yield 
estimates of mutated parasite allele frequency at each locus of interest.
RESULTS: The dhps540 mutation was common across all 14 sites, ranging from 55 to 
98.4% of sequences obtained. Frequency of the dhps581 mutation ranged from 0 to 
2.4%, except at Kayanga HC (Kagera Region, Lake Zone) where 24.9% of sequences 
obtained were mutated. The dhfr164 mutation was detected only at Kanyanga HC 
(0.06%).
CONCLUSION: By pooling DNA extracts, the allele frequency of mutations in 14 
sites could be directly determined on a single deep-sequencing run. The dhps540 
mutant was very common at all locations. Surprisingly, the dhps581 was common at 
one health center, but rare in all the others, suggesting that there is 
geographic micro-heterogeneity in mutant distribution and that accurate 
surveillance requires inclusion of multiple sites. A better understanding of the 
effect of the dhps581 mutant on the efficacy of IPTp-SP is needed.
