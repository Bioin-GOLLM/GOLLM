PURPOSE: The goal of the present study was to determine the efficacy of 
temozolomide (TEM) and pazopanib (PAZ) combined with FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, 
leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil) on a colorectal cancer patient-derived orthotopic 
xenograft (PDOX) mouse model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A colorectal cancer tumor from a patient previously 
established in non-transgenic nude mice was implanted subcutaneously in 
transgenic green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing nude mice in order to 
label the tumor stromal cells with GFP. Then labeled tumors were orthotopically 
implanted into the cecum of nude mice. Mice were randomized into four groups: 
Group 1, untreated control; group 2, TEM + PAZ; group 3, FOLFOX; group 4, 
TEM + PAZ plus FOLFOX. Tumor width, length, and mouse body weight were measured 
weekly. The Fluor Vivo imaging System was used to image the GFP-lableled tumor 
stromal cells in vivo. H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining were used 
for histological analysis.
RESULTS: All three treatments inhibited tumor growth as compared to the 
untreated control group. The combination of TEM + PAZ + FOLFOX regressed tumor 
growth significantly more effectively than TEM + PAZ or FOLFOX. Only the 
combination of TEM + PAZ + FOLFOX group caused a decrease in body weight. PAZ 
suppressed lymph vessels density in the colorectal cancer PDOX mouse model 
suggesting inhibition of lymphangiogenesis.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the combination of TEM + PAZ + FOLFOX has 
clinical potential for colorectal cancer patient.
