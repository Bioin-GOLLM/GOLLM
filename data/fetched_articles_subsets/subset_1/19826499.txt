Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 
(HMSN) is a genetically heterogeneous group of conditions that affect the 
peripheral nervous system. The disease is characterized by degeneration or 
abnormal development of peripheral nerves and exhibits a range of patterns of 
genetic transmission. In the majority of cases, CMT first appears in infancy, 
and its manifestations include clumsiness of gait, predominantly distal muscular 
atrophy of the limbs, and deformity of the feet in the form of foot drop. It can 
be classified according to the pattern of transmission (autosomal dominant, 
autosomal recessive, or X linked), according to electrophysiological findings 
(demyelinating or axonal), or according to the causative mutant gene. The 
classification of CMT is complex and undergoes constant revision as new genes 
and mutations are discovered. In this paper, we review the most efficient 
diagnostic algorithms for the molecular diagnosis of CMT, which are based on 
clinical and electrophysiological data.
