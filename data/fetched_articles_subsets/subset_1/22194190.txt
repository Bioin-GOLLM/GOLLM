C5L2, a G protein-coupled receptor, is known to be a functional receptor of 
acylation-stimulating protein, which is a stimulator of triglyceride synthesis 
and glucose transport. A novel C5L2 variant (S323I) was identified and its 
association with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) was recently reported. 
We looked for this SNP in three Chinese ethnic groups, including Han, Uygur, and 
Kazakh controls and patients with FCH and type 2 diabetes. One hundred and 
eighty-two unrelated subjects (77 of Han, 57 of Uygur, and 48 of Kazakh) with 
FCH were genotyped by direct sequencing, and 852 subjects (342 of Han, 338 of 
Uygur, 172 of Kazakh) with type 2 diabetes and 200 healthy controls (67 of Han, 
72 of Uygur, and 61 of Kazakh) chosen from a cardiovascular risk survey study 
were genotyped with PCR-RFLP analysis. All 182 subjects with FCH, 99.5% of the 
type 2 diabetes patients and 100% of the healthy controls were successfully 
genotyped. Neither the FCH subjects nor the type 2 diabetes patients were found 
to have the S323I variant. This variant was also not identified in the healthy 
controls. We found no evidence to demonstrate that the S323I polymorphism 
contributes to familial combined hyperlipidemia or type 2 diabetes in the 
Chinese population.
