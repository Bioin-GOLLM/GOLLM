Cytochrome c (Cytc) is a multifunctional protein that operates as an electron 
carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and plays a key role in 
apoptosis. We have previously shown that tissue-specific phosphorylations of 
Cytc in the heart, liver, and kidney play an important role in the regulation of 
cellular respiration and cell death. Here, we report that Cytc purified from 
mammalian brain is phosphorylated on S47 and that this phosphorylation is lost 
during ischemia. We have characterized the functional effects in vitro using 
phosphorylated Cytc purified from pig brain tissue and a recombinant 
phosphomimetic mutant (S47E). We crystallized S47E phosphomimetic Cytc at 1.55 Å 
and suggest that it spatially matches S47-phosphorylated Cytc, making it a good 
model system. Both S47-phosphorylated and phosphomimetic Cytc showed a lower 
oxygen consumption rate in reaction with isolated Cytc oxidase, which we propose 
maintains intermediate mitochondrial membrane potentials under physiologic 
conditions, thus minimizing production of reactive oxygen species. 
S47-phosphorylated and phosphomimetic Cytc showed lower caspase-3 activity. 
Furthermore, phosphomimetic Cytc had decreased cardiolipin peroxidase activity 
and is more stable in the presence of H2O2. Our data suggest that S47 
phosphorylation of Cytc is tissue protective and promotes cell survival in the 
brain.-Kalpage, H. A., Vaishnav, A., Liu, J., Varughese, A., Wan, J., Turner, A.
