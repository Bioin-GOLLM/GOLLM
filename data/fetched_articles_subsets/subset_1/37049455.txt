Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world. Lifestyle 
and eating patterns may have a significant impact on the prevention of this type 
of cancer. Bioactive food ingredients influence the gut microbiome and can have 
a protective effect. Bee products (honey, propolis, royal jelly, and bee venom) 
or pharmacologically active fractions obtained from them are widely used in many 
fields of medicine, pharmacy, and cosmetics. Some evidence suggests that bee 
products may have anti-cancer potential. The main bioactive components with 
anti-colon cancer potential from propolis and bee honey are polyphenols such as 
pinocembrin, galangin, luteolin, CAPE, Artepilin C, chrysin, caffeic, and 
p-coumaric acids. This review is focused on the new data on epidemiology, risk 
factors for colon cancer, and current reports on the potential role of bee 
products in the chemoprevention of this type of cancer.
