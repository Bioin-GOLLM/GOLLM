In clinical practice, it is found that autoimmune thyroid disease often 
additionally occurs with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). In addition, several studies showed that eye-specific autoimmune 
diseases may have a strong relationship with systemic autoimmune diseases. We 
focused on Graves' disease (GD) with ocular conditions, also known as Graves' 
ophthalmopathy (GO), trying to find out the potential genetic background related 
to GO, RA, and SLE. There were 40 GO cases and 40 healthy controls enrolled in 
this study. The association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 
the co-stimulatory molecule genes and GO was analyzed using a chi-square test. 
It showed that rs11571315, rs733618, rs4553808, rs11571316, rs16840252, and 
rs11571319 of CTLA4, rs3181098 of CD28, rs36084323 and rs10204525 of PDCD1, and 
rs11889352 and rs4675379 of ICOS were significantly associated with GO based on 
genotype analysis and/or allele analysis (p < 0.05). After summarizing the GO 
data and the previously published SLE and RA data, it was found that rs11571315, 
rs733618, rs4553808, rs16840252, rs11571319, and rs36084323 were shared in these 
three diseases. Furthermore, the bio-function was confirmed by dual-luciferase 
reporter assay. It was shown that rs733618 T > C and rs4553808 A > G 
significantly decreased the transcriptional activity (both p < 0.001). This 
study is the first to confirm that these three diseases share genetically 
predisposing factors, and our results support the proposal that rs733618 T > C 
and rs4553808 A > G have bio-functional effects on the transcriptional activity 
of the CTLA4 gene.
