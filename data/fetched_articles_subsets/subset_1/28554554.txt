Autosomal dominant mutations of DYNC1H1 cause a range of neurogenetic diseases, 
including mental retardation with cortical malformations, hereditary spastic 
paraplegia and spinal muscular atrophy. Using SNP array, linkage analysis and 
next generation sequencing, we identified two families and one isolated proband 
sharing a known spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity predominant (SMALED) 
causing mutation DYNC1H1 c.1792C>T, p.Arg598Cys, and another family harbouring a 
c.2327C>T, p.Pro776Leu mutation. Here, we present a detailed clinical and 
pathological examination of these patients, and show that patients with DYNC1H1 
mutations may present with a phenotype mimicking a congenital myopathy. We also 
highlight features that increase the phenotypic overlap with BICD2, which causes 
SMALED2. Serial muscle biopsies were available for several patients, spanning 
from infancy and early childhood to middle age. These provide a unique insight 
into the developmental and pathological origins of SMALED, suggesting in utero 
denervation with reinnervation by surrounding intact motor neurons and segmental 
anterior horn cell deficits. We characterise biopsy features that may make 
diagnosis of this condition easier in the future.
