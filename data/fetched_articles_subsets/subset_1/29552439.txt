Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with proximal dominant involvement 
(HMSN-P) is a motor and sensory neuronopathy with autosomal dominant 
inheritance, adult onset, slowly progressive course, and is associated with 
TRK-fused gene (TFG) mutation. At advanced stages, respiratory failure and 
dysphagia becomes life-threatoning, and patients typically die by their 70s. 
Although there is currently no evidence for effective treatment, a therapy may 
be found by elucidation of the function of TFG. Recently its pathomechanism has 
been proposed to be associated with abnormalities in protein transfer from the 
endoplasmic reticulum. Such pathomechanisms might involve a similar process in 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; thus, its pathomechanisms and treatment strategy 
might make it a good model for neurodegenerative disorders. It is of great value 
to clarify the natural history of HMSN-P, in oder to judge the treatment effect. 
By evaluating 97 patients (79 out of 97 were examined and all confirmed with 
p.Pro 285 Leu mutation) in this study, it was confirmed that this disease 
follows a uniform course in the earlier stages, and there are individual 
differences in the onset between 20 and 30 years. Such uniformity might be due 
to the proposed single gene abnormality. At advanced stages, there are larger 
individual differences in the progression, but the reasons for these are 
unknown. Longer survival might be achieved with a better care for respiratory 
failure and dysphagia if such cares were undertaken at appropriate times.
