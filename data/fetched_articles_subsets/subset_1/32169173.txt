Oocytes stockpile nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in cytoplasmic membrane sheets 
called annulate lamellae (AL) in preparation for rapid cell cycles during 
embryogenesis. Recently, Hampoelz et al. reported that AL-NPC assembly depends 
on the coordinated formation, transport, and interaction of biomolecular 
condensates containing distinct sets of nucleoporins.
