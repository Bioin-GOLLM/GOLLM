The mutations of HOXD13 gene have been involved in synpolydactyly (SPD), and the 
polyalanine extension mutation of Hoxd13 gene could lead to SPD in mice. In this 
study, a novel missense mutation of Hoxd13 (NM_000523: exon2: c.G917T: p.R306L) 
was identified in a Chinese family with SPD. The mice carrying the corresponding 
Hoxd13mutation were generated. The results showed that the homozygous mutation 
of Hoxd13 also caused SPD, but heterozygous mutation did not affect limbs 
development, which was different from that of SPD patients. With the increasing 
generation, the mice with homozygous Hoxd13 mutation presented more severe 
syndactyly. Western blotting showed that this mutation did not affect the 
protein expression of Hoxd13, suggesting that this mutation did not result in 
haploinsufficiency. Further analysis demonstrated that this homozygous 
Hoxd13mutation promoted osteoclast differentiation and bone loss, and enhanced 
the mRNA and protein expression of osteoclast-related genes Rank, c-Fos, and 
p65. Meanwhile, this homozygous Hoxd13 mutation elevated the level of 
phosphorylated Smad5 (pSmad5). Co-immunoprecipitation verified that this 
mutation attenuated the interaction between pSmad5 and HOXD13, suggesting that 
this mutation released more pSmad5. Inhibition of pSmad5 reduced the expression 
of Rank, c-Fos, and p65 despite in the mutation group. In addition, inhibition 
of pSmad5 repressed the osteoclast differentiation. ChIP assay confirmed that 
p65 and c-Fos could bind to the promoter of Rank. These results suggested that 
this novel Hoxd13 mutation promoted osteoclast differentiation by regulating 
Smad5/p65/c-Fos/Rank axis, which might provide a new insight into SPD 
development.
