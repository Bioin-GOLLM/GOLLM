E3 ligase BRUTUS (BTS), a putative iron sensor, is expressed in both root and 
shoot tissues in seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana. The role of BTS in root 
tissues has been well established. However, its role in shoot tissues has been 
scarcely studied. Comparative transcriptome analysis with shoot and root tissues 
revealed that BTS is involved in regulating energy metabolism by modulating 
expression of mitochondrial and chloroplast genes in shoot tissues. Moreover, in 
shoot tissues of bts-1 plants, levels of ADP and ATP and the ratio of ADP/ATP 
were greatly increased with a concomitant decrease in levels of soluble sugar 
and starch. The decreased starch level in bts-1 shoot tissues was restored to 
the level of shoot tissues of wild-type plants upon vanadate treatment. Through 
this study, we expand the role of BTS to regulation of energy metabolism in the 
shoot in addition to its role of iron deficiency response in roots.
