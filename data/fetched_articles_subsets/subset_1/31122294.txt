BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal brain tumor, lacking effective 
treatment. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is recognized as an 
attractive target for GBM treatment. However, GBMs have very poor responses to 
the first- and second-generation EGFR inhibitors. The third-generation 
EGFR-targeted drug, AZD9291, is a novel and irreversible inhibitor. It is 
noteworthy that AZD9291 shows excellent blood-brain barrier penetration and has 
potential for the treatment of brain tumors.
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity and effectiveness 
of AZD9291 in a preclinical GBM model.
RESULTS: AZD9291 showed dose-responsive growth inhibitory activity against six 
GBM cell lines. Importantly, AZD9291 inhibited GBM cell proliferation >â€‰10 times 
more efficiently than the first-generation EGFR inhibitors. AZD9291 induced GBM 
cell cycle arrest and significantly inhibited colony formation, migration, and 
invasion of GBM cells. In an orthotopic GBM model, AZD9291 treatment 
significantly inhibited tumor survival and prolonged animal survival. The 
underlying anti-GBM mechanism of AZD9291 was shown to be different from that of 
the first-generation EGFR inhibitors. In contrast to erlotinib, AZD9291 
continuously and efficiently inhibited the EGFR/ERK signaling in GBM cells.
CONCLUSION: AZD9291 demonstrated an efficient preclinical activity in GBM in 
vitro and in vivo models. AZD9291 has been approved for the treatment of lung 
cancer with good safety and tolerability. Our results support the possibility of 
conducting clinical trials of anti-GBM therapy using AZD9291.
