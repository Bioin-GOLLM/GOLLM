Understanding how human ACE2 genetic variants differ in their recognition by 
SARS-CoV-2 can have a major impact in leveraging ACE2 as an axis for treating 
and preventing COVID-19. In this work, we experimentally interrogate thousands 
of ACE2 mutants to identify over one hundred human single-nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) that are likely to have altered recognition by the virus, and make the 
complementary discovery that ACE2 residues distant from the spike interface can 
have a strong influence upon the ACE2-spike interaction. These findings 
illuminate new links between ACE2 sequence and spike recognition, and will find 
wide-ranging utility in SARS-CoV-2 fundamental research, epidemiological 
analyses, and clinical trial design.
