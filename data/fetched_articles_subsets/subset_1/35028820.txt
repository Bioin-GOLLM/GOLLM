PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Successful treatment of cancer can be hampered by the 
attendant risk of cardiotoxicity, manifesting as cardiomyopathy, left ventricle 
systolic dysfunction and, in some cases, heart failure. This risk can be 
mitigated if the injury to the heart is detected before the onset to 
irreversible cardiac impairment. The gold standard for cardiac imaging in 
cardio-oncology is echocardiography. Despite improvements in the application of 
this modality, it is not typically sensitive to sub-clinical or early-stage 
dysfunction. We identify in this review some emerging tracers for detecting 
incipient cardiotoxicity by positron emission tomography (PET).
RECENT FINDINGS: Vectors labeled with positron-emitting radionuclides (e.g., 
carbon-11, fluorine-18, gallium-68) are now available to study cardiac function, 
metabolism, and tissue repair in preclinical models. Many of these probes are 
highly sensitive to early damage, thereby potentially addressing the limitations 
of current imaging approaches, and show promise in preliminary clinical 
evaluations. The overlapping pathophysiology between cardiotoxicity and heart 
failure significantly expands the number of imaging tools available to 
cardio-oncology. This is highlighted by the emergence of radiolabeled probes 
targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) for sensitive detection of 
dysregulated healing process that underpins adverse cardiac remodeling. The 
growth of PET scanner technology also creates an opportunity for a renaissance 
in metabolic imaging in cardio-oncology research.
