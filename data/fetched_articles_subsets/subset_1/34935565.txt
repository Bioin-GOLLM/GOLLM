Transthyretin (TTR) is the precursor of the fibrils that compromise organ 
function in hereditary and sporadic systemic amyloidoses (ATTR). 
RNA-interference and anti-sense therapeutics targeting TTR hepatic transcription 
have been shown to reduce TTR amyloid formation. In the present study, we 
leveraged genetic and phenotypic information from the UK Biobank and 
transcriptomic profiles from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project to test the 
association of genetically regulated TTR gene expression with 7149 traits 
assessed in 420,531 individuals. We conducted a multi-tissue analysis of TTR 
transcription and identified an association with a operational procedure related 
to bone fracture (p = 5.46×10-6). Using tissue-specific TTR expression 
information, we demonstrated that the association is driven by the genetic 
regulation of TTR hepatic expression (odds ratio [OR] = 3.46, p = 9.51×10-5). 
Using the UK Biobank electronic health records (EHRs), we investigated the 
comorbidities affecting individuals undergoing this surgical procedure. 
Excluding bone fracture EHRs, we identified a pattern of health outcomes 
previously associated with ATTR manifestations. These included osteoarthritis 
(OR = 3.18, p = 9.18×10-8), carpal tunnel syndrome (OR = 2.15, p = .002), and a 
history of gastrointestinal diseases (OR = 2.01, p = 8.07×10-4). In conclusion, 
our study supports that TTR hepatic expression can affect health outcomes linked 
to physiological and pathological processes presumably related to the encoded 
protein.
