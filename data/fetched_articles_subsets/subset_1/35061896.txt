Homologous recombination (HR) is critical for error-free repair of DNA 
double-strand breaks. Chromatin loading of RAD51, a key protein that mediates 
the recombination, is a crucial step in the execution of the HR repair. Here, we 
present evidence that SUMOylation of RAD51 is crucial for the RAD51 recruitment 
to chromatin and HR repair. We found that topoisomerase 1-binding 
arginine/serine-rich protein (TOPORS) induces the SUMOylation of RAD51 at lysine 
residues 57 and 70 in response to DNA damaging agents. The SUMOylation was 
facilitated by an ATM-induced phosphorylation of TOPORS at threonine 515 upon 
DNA damage. Knockdown of TOPORS or expression of SUMOylation-deficient RAD51 
mutants caused reduction in supporting normal RAD51 functions during the HR 
repair, suggesting the physiological importance of the modification. We found 
that the SUMOylation-deficient RAD51 reduces the association with its crucial 
binding partner BRCA2, explaining its deficiency in supporting the HR repair. 
These findings altogether demonstrate a crucial role for TOPORS-mediated RAD51 
SUMOylation in promoting HR repair and genomic maintenance.
