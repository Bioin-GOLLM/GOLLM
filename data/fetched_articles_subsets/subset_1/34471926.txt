Infertility afflicts up to 15% of couples globally each year with men a 
contributing factor in 50% of these cases. Globozoospermia is a rare condition 
found in infertile men, which is characterized by defective acrosome biogenesis 
leading to the production of round-headed sperm. Here, we report that family 
with sequence similarity 209 (Fam209) is required for acrosome biogenesis in 
mouse sperm. FAM209 is a small transmembrane protein conserved among mammals. 
Loss of Fam209 results in fertility defects that are secondary to abnormalities 
in acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis, reminiscent of globozoospermia. 
Analysis of the FAM209 proteome identified DPY19L2, whose human orthologue is 
involved in the majority of globozoospermia cases. Although mutations in human 
and mouse Dpy19l2 have been shown to cause globozoospermia, no in vivo 
interacting partners of DPY19L2 have been identified until now. FAM209 
colocalizes with DPY19L2 at the inner nuclear membrane to maintain the 
developing acrosome. Here, we identified FAM209 as the first interacting partner 
of DPY19L2, and the second protein that is essential for acrosome biogenesis 
that localizes to the inner nuclear membrane.
