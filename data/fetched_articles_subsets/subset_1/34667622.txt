Two new 1-(thia-zol-2-yl)-4,5-di-hydropyrazoles have been synthesized from 
simple precursors, and characterized both spectroscopically and structurally. In 
addition, two inter-mediates in the reaction pathway have been isolated and 
characterized, one of them structurally. The mol-ecules of the inter-mediate 
(E)-1-(4-meth-oxy-phen-yl)-3-[4-(prop-2-yn-yloxy)phen-yl]prop-2-en-1-one, 
C19H16O3 (I), are linked by a combination of C-H⋯O and C-H⋯π(arene) hydrogen 
bonds to form ribbons. The products 
(RS)-5-(4-meth-oxy-phen-yl)-1-(4-phenythiazol-2-yl)-3-[4-(prop-2-yn--yloxy)phen-yl]-4,5-di-hydro-1H-pyrazole, 
C28H23N3O2S (II), and 
(RS)-5-(4-meth-oxy-phen-yl)-1-[4-(4-methyl-phen-yl)thia-zol-2-yl]-3-[4-(prop-2-yn-yloxy)phen-yl]-4,5-di-hydro-1H-pyrazole, 
C29H25N3O2S (III), are closely related - differing only by presence or absence 
of a methyl group at the aryl-thia-zolyl substituent - and crystallize in an 
isomorphous setting. Both mol-ecules contain an effectively planar 
di-hydro-pyrazole ring, and possess an overall T-shaped structure, which is a 
characteristic of triaryl-substituted 4,5-di-hydro-1-(thia-zol-2-yl)pyrazole 
compounds. The crystal packing is characterized by inter-molecular C-H⋯S and 
C-H⋯π (ar-yl/alkyne) inter-actions. A combination of two C-H⋯π(arene) hydrogen 
bonds links the product mol-ecules into sheets.
