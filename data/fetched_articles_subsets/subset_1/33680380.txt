BACKGROUND: The decisive etiology of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is 
still ambiguous, but we recognize the contribution of genetic aberration and 
environmental agents due to OSCC initiation. In the current study, we elucidate 
the potential impact of EGFR gene polymorphisms on the risk of OSCC in Southeast 
Iran.
METHODS: Forty-eight OSCC patients along with 100 healthy volunteers were 
included. Three polymorphisms of the EGFR gene (rs2227983, rs2293347 and 
rs2227984) were genotype by Tetra-ARMS PCR. Data were analyzed with a chi-square 
test, and p<0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: In rs2227983, the frequency of AG and GG genotypes were 62.5%, 37.5% in 
cases and 42%, 57% in the control group (P=0.02, OR=2.3) and also A allele 
frequency was 31.3% in the case and 22% in control (P=0.08, OR=0.62). AG + AA 
genotype frequency was 62.5% and 43% in case and control, respectively (p=0.03, 
OR=2.2). In rs2227984 and rs2293347, no statistical differences showed in the 
distribution of genotypes between the case and control group. Also the majority 
of the OSCC belonged to grade I (43.8%).
CONCLUSION: The present investigation indicated that rs2227983 polymorphism 
might contribute to OSCC susceptibility in Iran's southeast population. 
Although, with the inconsistent interpretation mentioned due to the various 
geographical residencies and populations, more studies of significant 
populations are suggested to validate our findings.
