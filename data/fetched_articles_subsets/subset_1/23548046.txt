Recent progress in the use of genetics to understand links between type 2 
diabetes and related metabolic traits.

Yaghootkar H, Frayling TM.

Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with 
increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this review is to highlight some 
of the insights into the mechanism underlying type 2 diabetes provided by 
genetic association studies.
