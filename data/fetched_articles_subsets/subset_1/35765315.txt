BACKGROUND: Global efforts are needed to elucidate the epidemiology of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the underlying cause of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including seroprevalence, risk factors, and 
long-term sequelae, as well as immune responses after vaccination across 
populations and the social dimensions of prevention and treatment strategies.
METHODS: In the United States, the National Cancer Institute in partnership with 
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, established the 
SARS-CoV-2 Serological Sciences Network (SeroNet) as the nation's largest 
coordinated effort to study coronavirus disease 2019. The network comprises 
multidisciplinary researchers bridging gaps and fostering collaborations among 
immunologists, epidemiologists, virologists, clinicians and clinical 
laboratories, social and behavioral scientists, policymakers, data scientists, 
and community members. In total, 49 institutions form the SeroNet consortium to 
study individuals with cancer, autoimmune disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, 
cardiovascular diseases, human immunodeficiency virus, transplant recipients, as 
well as otherwise healthy pregnant women, children, college students, and 
high-risk occupational workers (including healthcare workers and first 
responders).
RESULTS: Several studies focus on underrepresented populations, including ethnic 
minorities and rural communities. To support integrative data analyses across 
SeroNet studies, efforts are underway to define common data elements for 
standardized serology measurements, cellular and molecular assays, self-reported 
data, treatment, and clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we discuss the overarching framework for SeroNet 
epidemiology studies, critical research questions under investigation, and data 
accessibility for the worldwide scientific community. Lessons learned will help 
inform preparedness and responsiveness to future emerging diseases.
