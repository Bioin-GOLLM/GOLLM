BACKGROUND: Defects in ABCB4 have been found to cause progressive familial 
intrahepatic cholestasis type 3. Liver histology is important, but not specific, 
for diagnosis. Genotyping is conclusive.
AIM: To determine the pathogenetic role of two novel ABCB4 mutations in two 
unrelated children from North Africa and South Asia.
METHODS: In both children liver histology showed extensive ductular reaction 
with portal and periportal fibrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis displayed 
absence of MDR3 protein expression at the canalicular pole. Genotype analysis 
was performed.
RESULTS: Genotyping revealed two novel mutations in ABCB4: the c.1783 C>T 
(p.R595X) mutation in exon 15 was detected in compound heterozygosity with the 
c.937_992 in/del in exon 9 in one case, whereas the homozygous p.R595X mutation 
was recognized in the second child.
CONCLUSIONS: Two novel loss-of-function mutations have been identified. 
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 has a worldwide 
distribution and genetic analyses are conclusive for correct diagnosis.
