T lymphocytes are the principal actors of vertebrates' cell-mediated immunity. 
Like B cells, they can recognize an unlimited number of foreign molecules 
through their antigen-specific heterodimer receptors (TRs), which consist of αβ 
or γδ chains. The diversity of the TRs is mainly due to the unique organization 
of the genes encoding the α, β, γ, and δ chains. For each chain, multi-gene 
families are arranged in a TR locus, and their expression is guaranteed by the 
somatic recombination process. A great plasticity of the gene organization 
within the TR loci exists among species. Marked structural differences affect 
the TR γ (TRG) locus. The recent sequencing of multiple whole genome provides an 
opportunity to examine the TR gene repertoire in a systematic and consistent 
fashion. In this review, we report the most recent findings on the genomic 
organization of TRG loci in mammalian species in order to show differences and 
similarities. The comparison revealed remarkable diversification of both the 
genomic organization and gene repertoire across species, but also unexpected 
evolutionary conservation, which highlights the important role of the T cells in 
the immune response.
