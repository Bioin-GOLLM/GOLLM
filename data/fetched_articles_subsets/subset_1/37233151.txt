INTRODUCTION: Bone scintigraphy has emerged as a key tool for non-invasive 
etiologic diagnosis of transthyretin (ATTR) cardiac amyloidosis (CA). We focused 
on a new semi-quantification method (on planar imaging) that could complement 
the qualitative/visual Perugini scoring system, especially when SPET/CT is not 
available.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively/qualitatively evaluated 8674 
consecutive, planar 99mTc-biphosphonate scintigraphies (performed for 
non-cardiac reasons), identifying 68 (0.78%) individuals (mean age 79 ± 7 years, 
range 62-100 years; female/male ratio 16/52) presenting myocardial uptake. Due 
to the retrospective nature of the study, no SPET/CT, pathologic or genetic 
confirmation was obtained. The Perugini scoring system was determined (in 
patients presenting cardiac uptake) and compared with three newly proposed 
semi-quantitative indices. We took 349 consecutive bone scintigraphies, 
qualitatively absent of any cardiac/pulmonary uptake, as "healthy controls" 
(HC).
RESULTS: The heart-to-thigh ratio (RHT) and lung-to-thigh ratio (RLT) indices 
were significantly higher in patients than in HCs (p ≤ 0.0001). There were 
statistically significant differences for RHT in HCs vs. patients with 
qualitative Perugini scores of 1 or >1 (with p ranging from ≤0.001 to ≤0.0001). 
ROC curves showed that RHT outperformed the other indices and was more accurate 
in both male and female groups. Furthermore, in the male population, RHT 
accurately distinguished HCs and patients with scores of 1 (less likely affected 
by ATTR) from patients with qualitative scores >1 (more likely affected by ATTR) 
with an AUC of 99% (sensitivity: 95%; specificity: 97%).
CONCLUSION: The proposed semi-quantitative RHT index can 
accurately/semi-quantitatively distinguish between HCs and subjects probably 
affected by CA (Perugini scores from 1 to 3), and could be particularly useful 
when no SPET/CT data are available (such as in retrospective studies and data 
mining). Furthermore, RHT can semi-quantitatively predict, with very high 
accuracy, subjects in the male population more likely to be affected by ATTR. 
The present study, although using a very large sample, is however retrospective, 
monocentric, and therefore the generalizability of the results should be proved 
by an accurate external validation.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The proposed heart-to-thigh ratio (RHT) can distinguish 
healthy controls and subjects that are probably affected by cardiac amyloidosis 
in a simple and more reproducible way, as compared to standard 
qualitative/visual evaluation.
