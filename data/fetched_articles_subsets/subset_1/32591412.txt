The oncogene YAP has been shown previously to promote tumor growth and 
metastasis. However, how YAP influences the behavior of tumor cells traveling 
within the circulatory system has not been as well explored. Given that 
rate-limiting steps of metastasis are known to occur while tumor cells enter, 
travel through, or exit circulation, we sought to study how YAP influences tumor 
cell behavior within the circulatory system. Intravital imaging in live 
zebrafish embryos revealed that YAP influenced the distribution of tumor cells 
within the animal following intravenous injection. Control cells became lodged 
in the first capillary bed encountered in the tail, whereas cells overexpressing 
constitutively active YAP were able to travel through this capillary plexus, 
reenter systemic circulation, and seed in the brain. YAP controlled transit 
through these capillaries by promoting active migration within the vasculature. 
These results were corroborated in a mouse model following intravenous 
injection, where active YAP increased the number of circulating tumor cells over 
time. Our results suggest a possible mechanism whereby tumor cells can spread to 
organs beyond the first capillary bed downstream from the primary tumor. These 
results also show that a specific gene can affect the distribution of tumor 
cells within an animal, thereby influencing the global pattern of metastasis in 
that animal. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that YAP endows tumor 
cells with the ability to move through capillaries, allowing them to return to 
and persist in circulation, thereby increasing their metastatic spread.See 
related commentary by Davidson, p. 3797.
