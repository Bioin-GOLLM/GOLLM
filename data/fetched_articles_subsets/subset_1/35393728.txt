Ethical, environmental and health concerns around dairy products are driving a 
fast-growing industry for plant-based dairy alternatives, but undesirable 
flavours and textures in available products are limiting their uptake into the 
mainstream. The molecular processes initiated during fermentation by lactic acid 
bacteria in dairy products is well understood, such as proteolysis of caseins 
into peptides and amino acids, and the utilisation of carbohydrates to form 
lactic acid and exopolysaccharides. These processes are fundamental to 
developing the flavour and texture of fermented dairy products like cheese and 
yoghurt, yet how these processes work in plant-based alternatives is poorly 
understood. With this knowledge, bespoke fermentative processes could be 
engineered for specific food qualities in plant-based foods. This review will 
provide an overview of recent research that reveals how fermentation occurs in 
plant-based milk, with a focus on how differences in plant proteins and 
carbohydrate structure affect how they undergo the fermentation process. The 
practical aspects of how this knowledge has been used to develop plant-based 
cheeses and yoghurts is also discussed.
