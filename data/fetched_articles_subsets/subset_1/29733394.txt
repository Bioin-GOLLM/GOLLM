Sin3a is a core component of histone-deacetylation-activity-associated 
transcriptional repressor complex, playing important roles in early embryo 
development. Here, we reported that down-regulation of Sin3a led to the loss of 
embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and skewed differentiation into 
mesendoderm lineage. We found that Sin3a functioned as a transcriptional 
coactivator of the critical Nodal antagonist Lefty1 through interacting with 
Tet1 to de-methylate the Lefty1 promoter. Further studies showed that two amino 
acid residues (Phe147, Phe182) in the PAH1 domain of Sin3a are essential for 
Sin3a-Tet1 interaction and its activity in regulating pluripotency. Furthermore, 
genome-wide analyses of Sin3a, Tet1 and Pol II ChIP-seq and of 5mC MeDIP-seq 
revealed that Sin3a acted with Tet1 to facilitate the transcription of a set of 
their co-target genes. These results link Sin3a to epigenetic DNA modifications 
in transcriptional activation and have implications for understanding mechanisms 
underlying versatile functions of Sin3a in mouse ESCs.
