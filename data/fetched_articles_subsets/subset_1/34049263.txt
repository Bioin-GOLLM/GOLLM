INTRODUCTION: Brain sexual differentiation results from the effects of sex 
steroids on the developing brain. The presumptive route for brain 
masculinization is the direct induction of gene expression via activation of the 
estrogen receptors α and β and the androgen receptor through their binding to 
ligands and to coactivators, regulating the transcription of multiple genes in a 
cascade effect.
AIM: To analyze the implication of the estrogen receptor coactivators SRC-1, 
SRC-2, and SRC-3 in the genetic basis of gender incongruence.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analysis of 157 polymorphisms located at the estrogen 
receptor coactivators SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3, in 94 transgender versus 94 
cisgender individuals.
METHOD: Using SNPStats software, the allele and genotype frequencies were 
analyzed by χ2, the strength of the association was measured by binary logistic 
regression, estimating the odds ratio for each genotype. Measurements of linkage 
disequilibrium and haplotype frequencies were also performed.
RESULTS: We found significant differences at level P < .05 in 8 polymorphisms 
that correspond to 5.09% of the total. Three were located in SRC-1 and 5 in 
SRC-2. The odds ratio analysis showed significant differences at level P < .05 
for multiple patterns of inheritance. The polymorphisms analyzed were in linkage 
disequilibrium. The SRC-1 haplotypes CGA and CGG (global haplotype association P 
< .009) and the SRC-2 haplotypes GGTAA and GGTAG (global haplotype association P 
< .005) were overrepresented in the transgender population.
CONCLUSION: The coactivators SRC-1 and SRC-2 could be considered as candidates 
for increasing the list of potential genes for gender incongruence. Ramírez KDV,
