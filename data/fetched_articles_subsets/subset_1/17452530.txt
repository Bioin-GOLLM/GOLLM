Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense the presence of microbial and viral pathogens 
by signal transduction mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated. A single 
point mutation (H412R) in the polytopic endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident 
membrane protein UNC93B abolishes signaling via TLR3, 7, and 9. We show that 
UNC93B specifically interacts with TLR3, 7, 9, and 13, whereas introduction of 
the point mutation H412R in UNC93B abolishes their interactions. We establish 
the physical interaction of the intracellular TLRs with UNC93B in splenocytes 
and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Further, by expressing chimeric TLRs, 
we show that TLR3 and 9 bind to UNC93B via their transmembrane domains. We 
propose that a physical association between UNC93B and TLRs in the ER is 
essential for proper TLR signaling.
