The behavior of genetic circuits is often poorly predictable. A gene's 
expression level is not only determined by the intended regulators, but also 
affected by changes in ribosome availability imparted by expression of other 
genes. HereÂ we design a quasi-integral biomolecular feedback controller that 
enables the expression level of any gene of interest (GOI) to adapt to changes 
in available ribosomes. The feedback is implemented through a synthetic small 
RNA (sRNA) that silences the GOI's mRNA, and uses orthogonal extracytoplasmic 
function (ECF) sigma factor to sense the GOI's translation and to actuate sRNA 
transcription. Without the controller, the expression level of the GOI is 
reduced by 50% when a resource competitor is activated. With the controller, by 
contrast, gene expression level is practically unaffected by the competitor. 
This feedback controller allows adaptation of genetic modules to variable 
ribosome demand and thus aids modular construction of complicated circuits.
