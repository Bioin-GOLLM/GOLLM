Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) frequently harbor KRAS mutations. 
Although MEK inhibitors represent a plausible therapeutic option, most PDACs are 
innately resistant to these agents. Here, we identify a critical adaptive 
response that mediates resistance. Specifically, we show that MEK inhibitors 
upregulate the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 by triggering an association with 
its deubiquitinase, USP9X, resulting in acute Mcl-1 stabilization and protection 
from apoptosis. Notably, these findings contrast the canonical positive 
regulation of Mcl-1 by RAS/ERK. We further show that Mcl-1 inhibitors and 
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, which suppress Mcl-1 transcription, 
prevent this protective response and induce tumor regression when combined with 
MEK inhibitors. Finally, we identify USP9X as an additional potential 
therapeutic target. Together, these studies (1) demonstrate that USP9X regulates 
a critical mechanism of resistance in PDAC, (2) reveal an unexpected mechanism 
of Mcl-1 regulation in response to RAS pathway suppression, and (3) provide 
multiple distinct promising therapeutic strategies for this deadly malignancy.
