Recent studies showing an association between glucocerebrosidase deficiency and 
parkinsonism in Gaucher disease prompted an examination of the 
glucocerebrosidase gene sequence (GBA) and enzyme activity in brain samples from 
57 subjects carrying the diagnosis of Parkinson disease. Alterations in GBA were 
identified in 12 samples (21%) and were more frequent among the younger 
subjects. These included eight with mutations (N370S, L444P, K198T, and R329C) 
and four with probable polymorphisms (T369M and E326K). Our findings suggest 
that mutations in glucocerebrosidase may be a risk factor for the development of 
parkinsonism.
