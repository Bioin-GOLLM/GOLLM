In this issue of Blood, Hinds et al identify several novel polymorphic genomic 
loci that are associated with an increased risk of developing JAK2 V617F–driven 
clonal hematopoiesis and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Their findings 
affirm the notion that, although the acquisition of somatic mutations in 
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) genomes is an infrequent and apparently stochastic 
process, the fate of mutant cells and their clonal progeny is profoundly 
influenced by heritable genetic polymorphisms present in the host’s genome.
