The tumor suppressor, p53, plays an essential role in the cellular response to 
stress through regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, 
apoptosis and autophagy. Here, we used a cell-based reporter system for the 
detection of p53 response transcription to identify the marine sponge 
metabolites, ilimaquinone and ethylsmenoquinone, as activators of the p53 
pathway. We demonstrated that ilimaquinone and ethylsmenoquinone efficiently 
stabilize the p53 protein through promotion of p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 in 
both HCT116 and RKO colon cancer cells. Moreover, both compounds upregulate the 
expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, a p53-dependent gene, and suppress proliferation of 
colon cancer cells. In addition, ilimaquinone and ethylsmenoquinone induced G2/M 
cell cycle arrest and increased caspase-3 cleavage and the population of cells 
that positively stained with Annexin V-FITC, both of which are typical 
biochemical markers of apoptosis. Furthermore, autophagy was elicited by both 
compounds, as indicated by microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) 
puncta formations and LC3-II turnover in HCT116 cells. Our findings suggest that 
ilimaquinone and ethylsmenoquinone exert their anti-cancer activity by 
activation of the p53 pathway and may have significant potential as 
chemo-preventive and therapeutic agents for human colon cancer.
