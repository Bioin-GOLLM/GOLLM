Interleukin 10 is a central regulator of the antigen-presenting function of 
myeloid cells. It exerts immunomodulatory effects in vivo and induces a 
regulatory phenotype in monocyte-derived cells in vitro. We analyzed phenotype 
and function of monocytic cells in vitro in relation to the cytokine milieu and 
the timing of TLR-based activation. In GM-CSF/IL-4 cultured human monocytic 
cells, we identified two, mutually exclusive cell populations arising from 
undifferentiated cells: CD83+ fully activated dendritic cells and CD14+ 
macrophage like cells. Re-expression of CD14 occurs primarily after a sequential 
trigger with a TLR signal following IL-10 preincubation. This cell population 
with re-expressed CD14 greatly differs in phenotype and function from the CD83+ 
cells. Detailed analysis of individual subpopulations reveals that exogenous 
IL-10 is critical for inducing the shift toward the CD14+ population, but does 
not affect individual changes in marker expression or cell function in most 
cases. Thus, plasticity of CD14 expression, defining a subset of 
immunoregulatory cells, is highly relevant for the composition of cellular 
products (such as DC vaccines) as it affects the function of the total product.
