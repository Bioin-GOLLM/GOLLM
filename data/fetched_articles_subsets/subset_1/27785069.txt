PURPOSE: Controversial associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(rs2279744, rs937283, rs3730485) of the MDM2 gene and the etiology of squamous 
cell carcinomas (SCCs) have been reported. This merits further comprehensive 
assessment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically reviewed the available data and 
conducted an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the genetic effect of MDM2 
polymorphisms in SCC susceptibility, using Stata/SE 12.0 software.
RESULTS: After screening, 7,987 SCC cases and 12,954 controls from 26 eligible 
case-control studies were enrolled. Overall, compared with the control group, a 
significantly increased SCC risk was observed for the MDM2 rs2279744 
polymorphism in the Asian population (test of association: odds ratio [OR] 1.12, 
P=0.027 for G vs T; OR 1.26, P=0.016 for GG vs TT; OR 1.25, P<0.001 for GG vs TT 
+ TG; and OR 1.08, P=0.023 for carrier G vs T). In subgroup analysis by SCC 
type, a similarly increased esophageal SCC risk was detected (OR 1.19, P<0.001 
for G vs T; OR 1.46, P<0.001 for GG vs TT; and OR 1.48, P=0.005 for GG vs TT + 
TG). Furthermore, MDM2-TP53 double mutation was statistically associated with 
increased SCC susceptibility overall (OR 1.52, P=0.001), especially in the Asian 
population (OR 1.49, P=0.022). However, no significant difference between the 
control and case groups was obtained for MDM2 rs937283 or rs3730485 under any 
genetic model (all P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results highlight a positive association between the GG genotype 
of MDM2 rs2279744 polymorphism and an increased risk of esophageal SCC in the 
Asian population, which needs to be clarified by more large-scale studies.
