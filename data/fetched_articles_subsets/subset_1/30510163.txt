Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex and progressive disease requiring 
polypharmacy to manage hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular risk factors. However, 
most patients do not achieve combined treatment goals. To address this 
therapeutic gap, we have developed MEDI4166, a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) receptor agonist peptide fused to a proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) neutralising antibody that allows for glycaemic 
control and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering in a single 
molecule. The fusion has been engineered to deliver sustained peptide activity 
in vivo in combination with reduced potency, to manage GLP-1 driven adverse 
effects at high dose, and a favourable manufacturability profile. MEDI4166 
showed robust and sustained LDL-C lowering in cynomolgus monkeys and exhibited 
the anticipated GLP-1 effects in T2D mouse models. We believe MEDI4166 is a 
novel molecule combining long acting agonist peptide and neutralising antibody 
activities to deliver a unique pharmacology profile for the management of T2D.
