Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CM) 
constitute a mixed population of ventricular-, atrial-, nodal-like cells, 
limiting the reliability for studying chamber-specific disease mechanisms. 
Previous studies characterised CM phenotype based on action potential (AP) 
morphology, but the classification criteria were still undefined. Our aim was to 
use in silico models to develop an automated approach for discriminating the 
electrophysiological differences between hiPSC-CM. We propose the dynamic clamp 
(DC) technique with the injection of a specific IK1 current as a tool for 
deriving nine electrical biomarkers and blindly classifying differentiated CM. 
An unsupervised learning algorithm was applied to discriminate CM phenotypes and 
principal component analysis was used to visualise cell clustering. 
Pharmacological validation was performed by specific ion channel blocker and 
receptor agonist. The proposed approach improves the translational relevance of 
the hiPSC-CM model for studying mechanisms underlying inherited or acquired 
atrial arrhythmias in human CM, and for screening anti-arrhythmic agents.
