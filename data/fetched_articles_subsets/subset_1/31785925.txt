Natural product biosynthetic pathways are replete with enzymes repurposed for 
new catalytic functions. In some modular polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways, a 
GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT)-like enzyme with an additional 
decarboxylation function initiates biosynthesis. Here, we probe two PKS 
GNAT-like domains for the dual activities of S-acyl transfer from coenzyme A 
(CoA) to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and decarboxylation. The GphF and CurA 
GNAT-like domains selectively decarboxylate substrates that yield the 
anticipated pathway starter units. The GphF enzyme lacks detectable acyl 
transfer activity, and a crystal structure with an isobutyryl-CoA product analog 
reveals a partially occluded acyltransfer acceptor site. Further analysis 
indicates that the CurA GNAT-like domain also catalyzes only decarboxylation, 
and the initial acyl transfer is catalyzed by an unidentified enzyme. Thus, PKS 
GNAT-like domains are re-classified as GNAT-like decarboxylases. Two other 
decarboxylases, malonyl-CoA decarboxylase and EryM, reside on distant nodes of 
the superfamily, illustrating the adaptability of the GNAT fold.
