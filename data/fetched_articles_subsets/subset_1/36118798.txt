Inflammatory bowel diseases are considered immune disorders with a complex 
genetic architecture involving constantly changing endogenous and exogenous 
factors. The rapid evolution of genomic technologies and the emergence of newly 
discovered molecular actors are compelling the research community to reevaluate 
the knowledge and molecular processes. The human intestinal tract contains 
intestinal human microbiota consisting of commensal, pathogenic, and symbiotic 
strains leading to immune responses that can contribute and lead to both 
systemic and intestinal disorders including IBD. In this review, we attempted to 
highlight some updates of the new IBD features related to genomics, microbiota, 
new emerging therapies and some major established IBD risk factors.
