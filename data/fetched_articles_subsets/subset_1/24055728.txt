BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Thalassemia is one of the most common hereditary disorders. 
This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of thalassemia and the mutation 
spectrum in Chongqing, the southern area of China.
METHODS: A total of 1057 children were recruited from Chongqing. Hematological 
parameters were examined and globin genes were genetically analyzed.
RESULTS: The total frequency of thalassemia carriers was 7.76% in this group of 
children. Among these, α-thalassemia was 5.20%, β-thalassemia was 1.99% and 
abnormal hemoglobin variant was 0.57%. Furthermore, 24 cases of α-triplication 
were detected, frequency of which was 2.55%. The true prevalence of silent 
α-thalassemia was first reported in this study. In addition, six novel mutations 
that give rise to α-thalassemia and two rare abnormal hemoglobin variants were 
first identified in Chinese population.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that the population in Chongqing are at high 
risk of α- and β-thalassemia. The findings will be useful for genetic counseling 
and the prevention of severe thalassemias in this area.
