When compared to two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, 3D spheroids have been 
considered suitable in vitro models for drug discovery research and other 
studies of drug activity. Based on different 3D cell culture procedures, we 
describe procedures we have used to obtain 3D tumor spheroids by both the 
hanging-drop and ultra-low-attachment plate methods and to analyze the 
antiproliferative and antitumor efficacy of different chemotherapeutic agents, 
including a peptidomimetic. We have applied this method to breast and lung 
cancer cell lines such as BT-474, MCF-7, A549, and Calu-3. We also describe a 
proximity ligation assay of the cells from the spheroid model to detect 
protein-protein interactions of EGFR and HER2. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.
