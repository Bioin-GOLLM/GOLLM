INTRODUCTION: Exenatide is gradually released from exenatide once weekly (QW) 
microspheres, and at steady state, consistently controls glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This post hoc analysis examined 
the timing to onset of clinical responses and their correlations with exenatide 
concentrations after initiation of exenatide QW in patients with T2D.
METHODS: Trial data were retrospectively analyzed to explore the early clinical 
responses to exenatide QW, including the relationship of exenatide concentration 
with its effects on efficacy [fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, and body 
weight] and tolerability (nausea and vomiting). Exenatide QW efficacy and 
tolerability data were from DURATION-5, a 24-week, randomized, 
comparator-controlled trial [intent-to-treat (ITT) population]. Exenatide 
concentrations were measured in a patient subset (pharmacokinetic population).
RESULTS: In the ITT (n = 129)/pharmacokinetic (n = 72) populations, baseline 
FPG, HbA1c, and body weight were 173/173 mg/dL, 8.5%/8.4%, and 97/98 kg, 
respectively. Exenatide concentrations gradually increased until reaching steady 
state at week 8. By week 4, the FPG reduction (-32.4 mg/dL) was 94% of the 
week 24 reduction (-34.6 mg/dL). Reductions in HbA1c began by week 4 (-0.6%) and 
stabilized by week 14 (week 24: -1.6%). Weight reduction at week 4 was -0.7 kg 
and decreased further (week 24: -2.3 kg). Peak nausea (7.2%) and vomiting (2.4%) 
occurred at weeks 6-8, declining thereafter.
CONCLUSION: Clinically relevant responses to exenatide QW were evident by 
week 4, after exenatide concentration passed the therapeutic threshold but 
before steady state was achieved.
