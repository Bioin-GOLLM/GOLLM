BACKGROUND: HPV genotypes are the most common etiological factor for genital 
neoplasia. It would appear that sexually transmitted infections accompanied with 
HPV genotypes might have synergistic interactions in cancer progression. The 
genetic polymorphisms are involved in metabolizing carcinogens which may 
contribute to the susceptibility of developing genital cancers by less efficient 
or overly down metabolic pathways and cell signaling. MTHFR polymorphisms are 
related to several metabolic disorders and human cancers. We investigated the 
contribution of MTHFR 1298 and MTHFR 677 polymorphisms as potential risk factors 
for outcomes with HPV genotypes and STIs in Iranian population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: As a case-control study, MTHFR A1298C and C677T were 
assessed for SNPs analysis using a PCR-RFLP assay in 50 cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia (CIN) cases, 98 HPV-positive subjects and 47 non-cancerous/non-HPV 
patients as healthy controls.
RESULTS: Finding suggested a significant association between the MTHFR 1298 CC 
polymorphisms (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.13-10.82, P ≤ 0.05) in women with CIN as 
compared to non-cancerous/non-HPV subjects. There was not a significant 
difference of MTHFR 677 between outcomes.
DISCUSSION: It would seem MTHFR 1298 CC is more likely to be a potential risk 
factor for HPV-cervical cancer progression. Consequences support further 
attempts to understand the clinical manifestations of neoplasia related to 
genital infections and gene mutations.
