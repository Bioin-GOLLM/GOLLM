Constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway/β-catenin signaling may be important 
in aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). However, significant gaps remain in our 
understanding of the prevalence and clinical outcomes after adrenalectomy in APA 
patients harboring CTNNB1 mutations. The molecular expression of CYP11B2 and 
gonadal receptors in adenomas were also explored. Adenomas from 219 APA patients 
(95 men; 44.2%; aged 50.5 ± 11.9 years) showed a high rate of somatic mutations 
(n = 128, 58.4%). The majority of them harbored KCNJ5 mutations (n = 116, 
52.9%); 8 patients (3.7%, 6 women) had CTNNB1 mutations. Patients with APAs 
harboring CTNNB1 mutations were older and had shorter duration of hypertension. 
After adrenalectomy, CTNNB1 mutation carriers had a higher possibility (87.5%) 
of residual hypertension than other APA patients. APAs harboring CTNNB1 
mutations have heterogeneous staining of β-catenin and variable expression of 
gonadal receptors and both CYP11B1 and CYP11B2. This suggests that CTNNB1 
mutations may be more related to tumorigenesis rather than excessive aldosterone 
production.
