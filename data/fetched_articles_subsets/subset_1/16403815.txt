CONTEXT: Defects in thyroglobulin (Tg) synthesis are one of the causes of 
thyroid dyshormonogenesis. Only a few mutations in the Tg gene have been 
described.
OBJECTIVES: We describe a novel Tg gene mutation and discuss the mechanisms by 
which it causes dyshormonogenesis with subsequent malignant transformation.
CASES: Two siblings aged 21 and 19 yr presented with recurrent goiters for which 
they had undergone multiple thyroid surgeries since early childhood. The older 
sibling was diagnosed with metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma at age 15 yr.
METHODS: The entire coding region and intron-exon boundaries of the Tg gene were 
amplified and sequenced from the patients. We also sequenced the boundaries of 
exon 5 and intron 5 from both parents. RT-PCR amplification of a cDNA fragment 
encompassing exons 4-6 was also performed.
RESULTS: A homozygous G to A point mutation at position +1 of the splice donor 
site of intron 5 (g.IVS5+1G-->A) was detected in both patients, whereas a 
monoallelic mutation was found in their parents. RT-PCR amplification of a cDNA 
fragment covering exons 4-6 revealed a 191-bp fragment in the patients and 351- 
and 191-bp fragments in the parents. Sequence analysis of these two fragments 
confirmed deletion of exon 5 in the 191-bp fragment.
CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant splicing occurred as a result of the g.IVS5+1G-->A 
mutation, which caused fusion of exons 4 and 6, resulting in the frame shift at 
codon position 141 and a premature stop codon at position 147 (FS141-->147X). 
The malignant transformation is likely a result of prolonged TSH stimulation.
