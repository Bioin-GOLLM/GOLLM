Posttransfusion purpura (PTP) is an uncommon, but potentially fatal, transfusion 
reaction characterized by profound thrombocytopenia and bleeding. PTP is caused 
by alloimmunization to human platelet specific antigens following blood 
component transfusion. Although there is evidence of a wide serological spectrum 
of culprit antibodies implicated, Anti-human-platelet-antigen- (HPA-) 1a is the 
most common antibody in cases reported. We report a case of posttransfusion 
purpura in an African American. The patient was negative for HPA-1a antibodies, 
but anti-HPA-1b was identified with a platelet phenotype of HPA-1a/HPA-1a. 
Although less common, HPA-1b antibody may be an important consideration in 
posttransfusion purpura diagnosed in patients of African descent.
