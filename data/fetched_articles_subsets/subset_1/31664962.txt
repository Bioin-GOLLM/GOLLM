BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and BRAF 
expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is not well-defined. In this study 
we investigated alterations in PD-L1, BRAF and EGFR by using 
immunohistochemistry analysis in a cohort of consecutively enrolled NPC 
patients.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 154 NPC patients form our previous study (BMC 
Cancer. 2013; 13:226) were conducted. Survival and prognostic impacts were 
analyzed based on PD-L1, BRAF and EGFR expression levels.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty four patients were included in this study. PD-L1 
expression was detected in 87.7% of patients; 14.3% had 1-5% PD-L1 expression, 
47.4% had 5-49% expression while 26% had ≥50% expression Higher PD-L1 expression 
was significantly associated with shorter PFS and OS. The median PFS was 
25 months (95% CI 15.7-34.3 months) and OS was 35 months (95% CI 
22.60-47.4 months) for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50%; both median PFS and 
OS were not yet reached for patients with PD-L1 expression < 50%. PFS was 
significantly higher in BRAF mutation positive patients (5-year PFS: 55.1% vs. 
30.8%, P = 0.044).
CONCLUSION: Tumor PD-L1 expression and BRAF mutation are associated with poor 
outcomes in patients with NPC. This study was retrospectively registered in 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03989297) on 2019-6-18.
