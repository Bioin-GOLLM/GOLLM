COVID-19 is the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. 
Cytokine storm appears to be a factor in COVID-19 mortality. Echinacea species 
have been used historically for immune modulation. A previous rapid review 
suggested that Echinacea supplementation may decrease the levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in cytokine storm. The objective of the 
present systematic review was to identify all research that has assessed changes 
in levels of cytokines relevant to cytokine storm in response to administration 
of Echinacea supplementation. The following databases were searched: Medline 
(Ovid), AMED (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Ovid). Title and abstract 
screening, full text screening, and data extraction were completed in duplicate 
using a piloted extraction template. Risk of bias assessment was completed. 
Qualitative analysis was used to assess for trends in cytokine level changes. 
The search identified 279 unique publications. After full text screening, 105 
studies met criteria for inclusion including 13 human studies, 24 animal 
studies, and 71 in vitro or ex vivo studies. The data suggest that Echinacea 
supplementation may be associated with a decrease in the pro-inflammatory 
cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF, as well as an increase in the anti-inflammatory 
cytokine IL-10. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally high. 
While there is currently no substantive research on the therapeutic effects of 
Echinacea in the management of either cytokine storm or COVID-19, the present 
evidence related to the herb's impact on cytokine levels suggests that further 
research may be warranted in the form of a clinical trial involving patients 
with COVID-19.
