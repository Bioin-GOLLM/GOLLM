BACKGROUND: The functional Ser9Gly single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 
dopamine D3 receptor gene is associated with impulse control disorders (ICD) in 
Parkinson's disease (PD) in Indian patients. Whether the same SNP modulates 
impulsivity in PD patients without active ICD is unknown. We aimed to compare 
decision-making under uncertainty in PD patients with DRD3 p.S9G (rs6280) 
variants CT/CC or TT.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study including PD patients (n = 78) 
whose DRD3 p.S9G (rs6280) genotypic status was known (CC, CT, and TT). 
Decision-making was assessed using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT).
RESULTS: IGT total (p = 0.267) or block scores did not differ between the DRD3 
rs6280 variant groups. Deck choice analysis revealed that the CT/CC group showed 
a skewed preference in deck choice (p = 0.002) due to significantly fewer draws 
from deck B, compared to all other decks (deck A, p < 0.001; deck C, p = 0.004; 
deck D, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The functional Ser9Gly DRD3 variant is associated with aberrant 
decision-making under uncertainty in PD patients without active ICD. This 
ability to modulate impulsivity may underlie its association with clinical ICD 
in PD.
