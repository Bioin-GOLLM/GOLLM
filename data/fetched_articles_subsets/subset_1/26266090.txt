OBJECTIVE: Obesity is an enormous burden for patients and health systems 
world-wide. Brown adipose tissue dissipates energy in response to cold and has 
been shown to be metabolically active in human adults. The type I transforming 
growth factor β (TGFβ) receptor Activin receptor-like kinase 7 (Alk7) is highly 
expressed in adipose tissues and is down-regulated in obese patients. Here, we 
studied the function of Alk7 in brown adipocytes.
METHODS: Using pharmacological and genetic tools, Alk7 signaling pathway and its 
effects were studied in murine brown adipocytes. Brown adipocyte differentiation 
and activation was analyzed.
RESULTS: Alk7 is highly upregulated during differentiation of brown adipocytes. 
Interestingly, Alk7 expression is increased by cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) 
signaling, which enhances brown adipocyte differentiation. Activin AB 
effectively activates Alk7 and SMAD3 signaling. Activation of Alk7 in brown 
preadipocytes suppresses the master adipogenic transcription factor PPARγ and 
differentiation. Stimulation of Alk7 during late differentiation of brown 
adipocytes reduces lipid content and adipogenic marker expression but enhances 
UCP1 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a so far unknown crosstalk between cGMP and Alk7 signaling 
pathways. Tight regulation of Alk7 is required for efficient differentiation of 
brown adipocytes. Alk7 has differential effects on adipogenic differentiation 
and the development of the thermogenic program in brown adipocytes.
