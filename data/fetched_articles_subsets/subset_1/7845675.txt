Germline mutations within one of six codons of the RET proto-oncogene account 
for the majority of cases of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A and type 
2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). MEN 2A and FMTC mutations 
characterised thus far occur exclusively in the cysteine-rich domain of the 
extracellular region of RET. We now report a missense mutation in the 
intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of RET in the germline of a family with 
FMTC that does not have a cysteine codon mutation. In this family, the mutation, 
which alters GAG (Glu) to GAC (Asp) at codon 768, segregates with the FMTC 
phenotype. The same mutation was also detected in sporadic MTC but not in 
corresponding constitutional DNA, confirming that it is likely to be of 
pathological significance rather than a rare polymorphism.
