BACKGROUND: Thyroid-like low-grade nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma 
(TL-LGNPPA) is a rare nasopharyngeal malignant tumor that is easy to 
misdiagnose. Immunohistochemistry plays an indispensable role in distinguishing 
TL-LGNPPA from other malignancies. However, there is no article to summarize the 
immunohistochemical characteristics of TL-LGNPPA. Herein, we report a case of 
TL-LGNPPA and present the immunohistochemical results reported in the Chinese 
literature.
METHODS: An electronic search of the CNKI (China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure) database was performed. From our literature survey, 53 cases of 
TL-LGNPPA (including the case described in this report) have been identified in 
China. We summarize the Chinese literature's clinical characteristics, 
immunohistochemical results, treatments, and prognosis of 53 cases.
RESULTS: Based on our literature survey, 53 cases of TL-LGNPPA (including the 
case described in this report) have been reported in China. We found TL-LGNPPA 
and papillary thyroid carcinoma were positive for TTF-1 and CK19. TL-LGNPPA was 
negative for TG and PAX-8, whereas papillary thyroid carcinoma was positive for 
TG and PAX-8. However, negative expression of TTF-1 and positive expression of 
TG were also found in some TL-LGNPPA cases. Our literature survey found that all 
TL-LGNPPA cases were negative for PAX-8.Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous 
immunohistochemical determination of TTF-1 and CK19, as well as TG and PAX-8, 
can increase the diagnostic accuracy of TL-LGNPPA.
CONCLUSION: The 4th edition of the World Health Organization Classification of 
Head and Neck Tumors (WHO-HNT) indicates that NPPA with positive expression of 
cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and TTF-1 and negative expression of TG is called 
TL-LGNPPA.
