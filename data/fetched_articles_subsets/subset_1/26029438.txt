The crystal structure of the title compound, berkeleydione [systematic name; 
(5aS,7R,9S,11R,11aS)-methyl 
9-hy-droxy-1,1,5,7,9,11a-hexa-methyl-14-methyl-idene-3,8,10-trioxo-1,3,4,5a,6,7,8,9,10,11,11a,12-dodeca-hydro-7,11-methano-cycloocta-[4,5]cyclo-hepta-[1,2-c]pyran-11-carboxyl-ate], 
C26H32O7, has been reported previously [Stierle et al. (2004 ▶). Org. Lett. 6, 
1049-1052]. However, the absolute configuration could not be determined from the 
data collected with Mo Kα radiation and has now been determined by refinement of 
the Flack parameter with data collected using Cu Kα radiation. It is in 
agreement with the previous circular dichroism assignment, and the crystal 
packing is similar to that described previously.
