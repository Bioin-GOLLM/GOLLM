We evaluated the role of NM_001024924.1:c.1330+1646C>T (rs13117307) single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), situated in the intronic region of exocyst 
complex component 1 (EXCO1), in the development and spreading of cervical 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Utilizing high resolution melting curve analysis, 
we analyzed this polymorphism in patients with cervical SCC (n=485) and controls 
(n=509) in the Polish Caucasian population. Logistic regression analysis was 
used to adjust for age, parity, oral contraceptive use, tobacco smoking, and 
menopausal status. The influence of this polymorphism on the expression of EXCO1 
was assessed by reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR analysis. 
For all patients with SCC, the p trend value calculated for rs13117307 was 
statistically significant (ptrend=0.0158). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for T/T 
vs. C/C was 1.434 (95 % CI 1.105-1.861, p=0.007). We also found a significant 
contribution of rs13117307 to tumor stages III, IV and grade of differentiation 
G3. Other contributors are parity, oral contraceptive use, smoking, and women of 
postmenopausal age. We observed significant upregulation of EXCO1 transcript 
levels in the non-cancerous cervical tissues in carriers of the T/T vs. C/C 
(p=0.016), as well as an increase in the EXCO1 transcript levels in the cervical 
SCC tissue in carriers of the T/T vs. C/C (p=0.029) and for T/T vs C/T 
(p=0.0032). The rs13117307 SNP variants may upregulate the transcription of 
EXCO1, as well as the risk of development and spreading of cervical SCC.
