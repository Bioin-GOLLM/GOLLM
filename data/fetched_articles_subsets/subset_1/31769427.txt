The liver is a key organ for metabolism, protein synthesis, detoxification, and 
endocrine function, and among liver diseases, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, 
malignant tumors, and congenital disease, liver cancer is one of the leading 
causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Conventional therapeutic options such 
as embolization and chemotherapy are not effective against advanced-stage liver 
cancer; therefore, continuous efforts focus on the development of novel 
therapeutic options, including molecular targeted agents and gene therapy. In 
this review, we will summarize the progress toward the development of gene 
therapies for liver cancer, with an emphasis on recent clinical trials and 
preclinical studies.
