Large multidomain proteins occur in different conformational states to function. 
Detection and monitoring of these different structural states are of crucial 
interest for understanding the mechanics of proteins. Using computational 
methods, we show that different protein conformational states of the two-domain 
70 kDa human Heat-shock protein (hHsp70), with similar vibrational density of 
states, lead to remarkably different far-IR spectra at acoustical frequencies (ν 
< 300 GHz). We found that the slow damped motions of the positively charged 
residues of hHsp70 contribute the most to collective IR active modes at low 
frequencies (ν < 300 GHz). We predicted that different structural states and 
functional modes of large proteins, such as hHsp70, might be detected in the 
sub-THz frequency range by single-molecule spectroscopy similar to the recent 
extraordinary acoustic Raman spectroscopy (Wheaton S.; Nat. Photonics2015, 9, 
68-72).
