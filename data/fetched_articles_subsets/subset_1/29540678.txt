Mycolactone is the exotoxin virulence factor of Mycobacterium ulcerans that 
causes the neglected tropical disease Buruli ulcer. We recently showed it to be 
a broad spectrum inhibitor of Sec61-dependent co-translational translocation of 
proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). An outstanding question is the 
molecular pathway linking this to its known cytotoxicity. We have now used 
translational profiling to better understand the reprogramming that occurs in 
cells exposed to mycolactone. Gene ontology identified enrichment in genes 
involved in cellular response to stress, and apoptosis signalling among those 
showing enhanced translation. Validation of these results supports a mechanism 
by which mycolactone activates an integrated stress response meditated by 
phosphorylation of eIF2α via multiple kinases (PERK, GCN, PKR) without 
activation of the ER stress sensors IRE1 or ATF6. The response therefore 
uncouples the integrated stress response from ER stress, and features 
translational and transcriptional modes of genes expression that feature the key 
regulatory transcription factor ATF4. Emphasising the importance of this 
uncoupled response in cytotoxicity, downstream activation of this pathway is 
abolished in cells expressing mycolactone-resistant Sec61α variants. Using 
multiple genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that eIF2α 
phosphorylation is responsible for mycolactone-dependent translation 
attenuation, which initially protects cells from cell death. However, chronic 
activation without stress remediation enhances autophagy and apoptosis of cells 
by a pathway facilitated by ATF4 and CHOP. Our findings demonstrate that priming 
events at the ER can result in the sensing of stress within different cellular 
compartments.
