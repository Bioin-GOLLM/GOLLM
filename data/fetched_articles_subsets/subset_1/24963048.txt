PURPOSE: Numerous biomarkers for pancreatic cancer have been reported. We 
determined the extent to which such biomarkers are expressed throughout 
metastatic progression, including those that effectively predict biologic 
behavior.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Biomarker profiling was performed for 35 oncoproteins in 
matched primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer tissues from 36 rapid autopsy 
patients. Proteins of significance were validated by immunolabeling in an 
independent sample set, and functional studies were performed in vitro and in 
vivo.
RESULTS: Most biomarkers were similarly expressed or lost in expression in most 
samples analyzed, and the matched primary and metastases from a specific patient 
were most similar to each other than to other patients. However, a subset of 
proteins showed extensive interpatient heterogeneity, one of which was p38 MAPK. 
Strong positive pp38 MAPK immunolabeling was significantly correlated with 
improved postresection survival by multivariate analysis (median overall 
survival 27.9 months, P = 0.041). In pancreatic cancer cells, inhibition of 
functional p38 by SB202190 increased cell proliferation in vitro in both 
low-serum and low-oxygen conditions. High functional p38 activity in vitro 
corresponded to lower levels of pJNK protein expression, and p38 inhibition 
resulted in increased pJNK and pMKK7 by Western blot analysis. Moreover, JNK 
inhibition by SP600125 or MKK7 siRNA knockdown antagonized the effects of p38 
inhibition by SB202190. In vivo, SP600125 significantly decreased growth rates 
of xenografts with high p38 activity compared with those without p38 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional p38 MAPK activity contributes to overall survival 
through JNK signaling, thus providing a rationale for JNK inhibition in 
pancreatic cancer management.
