BACKGROUND: To evaluate the outcomes in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) 
patients who achieved excellent response to initial treatment and developed 
distant metastasis during follow-up.
METHODS: Thyroid cancer patients registered in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital 
thyroid cancer database between January 1979 and December 2019 were assessed.
RESULTS: Among 1053 DTC patients with excellent response to initial therapy, 14 
(1.3%) patients developed metastatic disease during follow-up, including 6 males 
and 8 females with median age of 50.2 years [interquartile range (IQR), 
39.9-53.7]. Nine (64.3%) patients had papillary cancer, four (28.6%) had 
follicular cancer, and one (7.1%) had Hürthle cell cancer. Most patients (92.9%) 
had stage I disease at diagnosis. The sites of metastasis were lung (71.4%), 
bone (7.1%), mediastinum (7.1%) and multiple sites (14.3%). With a median 
follow-up of 18.3 years (IQR, 14.8-23.8), 2 patients had disease-specific 
mortality. The 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival after the diagnosis of 
distant metastasis was 92% and 74%, respectively. Multiple sites of metastasis 
was associated with increased risk of mortality (P = 0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: A small proportion of DTC patients with an excellence response to 
initial therapy developed distant metastasis during follow-up. Multiple organ 
distant metastases conferred a worse disease-specific survival.
