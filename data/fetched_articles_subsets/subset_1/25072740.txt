We compare the aqueous self-assembly behavior within the homologous peptide 
series AnK, where A is alanine, K is lysine, and n = 4, 6, 8, and 10. The 
aqueous peptide solubility, ϕ(s) (volume fraction), depends strongly on the 
number of hydrophobic alanine residues and decreases approximately as ϕ(s) ≈ 
10(-n). Also the self-assembly structure depends on n. A4K is highly 
water-soluble and shows no relevant self-assembly. A6K, which has been 
extensively studied previously, forms hollow nanotubes in water. A8K and A10K 
self-assembly is characterized here using a combination of small- and wide-angle 
X-ray scattering, static and dynamic light scattering, cryo transmission 
electron microscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. They both form similar 
thin rodlike aggregates with lengths on the order of 100 nm and a biaxial 
cross-section with dimensions of 4 nm × 8 nm. We show that different sample 
preparation protocols result in different lengths of the A10K rodlike 
aggregates. On the basis of these findings, the question of thermodynamic 
equilibrium of peptide self-assembly is discussed.
