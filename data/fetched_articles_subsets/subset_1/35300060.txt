INTRODUCTION: Lymph node metastasis (LNM) from primary tumors of the central 
nervous system (CNS) is an infrequent condition, and classically it was thought 
that CNS tumors could not spread via the lymphatic route. Recent discoveries 
about this route of dissemination make its knowledge necessary for surgeons and 
pathologists to avoid delays in diagnosis and unnecessary treatments. The aim of 
this paper is to review the literature and to discuss the relevant pathogenetic 
mechanism and the cytologic features along with recommendations for surgical 
treatment of these cervical LNM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review 
of the literature published from 1944 to 2021, updating the comprehensive review 
published in 2010 by our group.
RESULTS: Our review includes data of 143 articles obtaining 174 patients with 
LNM from a primary CNS tumor. The mean age of the patients was 31.9 years 
(range, 0.1-87) and there were 61 females (35.1%) and 103 males (59.2%), and in 
10 cases (5.7%) the gender was not specified. The more frequent sites of distant 
metastasis were bones (23%), lungs (11.5%) and non-cervical lymph nodes (11%).
CONCLUSION: Cervical LNM from CNS tumors is infrequent. Pathologic diagnosis can 
be obtained by fine-needle aspiration cytology in most cases, giving surgeons 
the option to plan the appropriate surgical treatment. Given the poor prognosis 
of these cases, the most conservative possible cervical dissection is usually 
the treatment of choice.
