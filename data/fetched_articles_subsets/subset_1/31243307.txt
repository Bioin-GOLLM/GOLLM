There is a need to qualify additively manufactured parts that are used in highly 
regulated industries such as aerospace and nuclear power. This paper 
investigates the use of resonant ultrasound measurements to predict the 
mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V manufactured by selective laser melting using 
a Renishaw AM 250. It is first demonstrated why R2 should not be used to assess 
the predictive capability of a model, before introducing a method for 
calculating predicted R2, which is then used to assess the models. It is found 
that a linear model with the resonant frequency peaks as predictors cannot be 
used to predict elongation at failure or reduction in area. However, linear 
models did demonstrate better predictive capabilities for Young's modulus, yield 
strength, and especially ultimate tensile strength.
