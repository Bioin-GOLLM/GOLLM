This 2022 European Atherosclerosis Society lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] consensus 
statement updates evidence for the role of Lp(a) in atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and aortic valve stenosis, provides clinical 
guidance for testing and treating elevated Lp(a) levels, and considers its 
inclusion in global risk estimation. Epidemiologic and genetic studies involving 
hundreds of thousands of individuals strongly support a causal and continuous 
association between Lp(a) concentration and cardiovascular outcomes in different 
ethnicities; elevated Lp(a) is a risk factor even at very low levels of 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. High Lp(a) is associated with both 
microcalcification and macrocalcification of the aortic valve. Current findings 
do not support Lp(a) as a risk factor for venous thrombotic events and impaired 
fibrinolysis. Very low Lp(a) levels may associate with increased risk of 
diabetes mellitus meriting further study. Lp(a) has pro-inflammatory and 
pro-atherosclerotic properties, which may partly relate to the oxidized 
phospholipids carried by Lp(a). This panel recommends testing Lp(a) 
concentration at least once in adults; cascade testing has potential value in 
familial hypercholesterolaemia, or with family or personal history of (very) 
high Lp(a) or premature ASCVD. Without specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies, early 
intensive risk factor management is recommended, targeted according to global 
cardiovascular risk and Lp(a) level. Lipoprotein apheresis is an option for very 
high Lp(a) with progressive cardiovascular disease despite optimal management of 
risk factors. In conclusion, this statement reinforces evidence for Lp(a) as a 
causal risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes. Trials of specific 
Lp(a)-lowering treatments are critical to confirm clinical benefit for 
cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis.
