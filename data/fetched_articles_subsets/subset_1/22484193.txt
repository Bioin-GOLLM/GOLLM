Metastatic melanoma is notoriously resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
regimens. The prospect for newly diagnosed metastatic melanoma patients is grim, 
with a median survival of less than 1 year. Currently, the only therapies 
resulting in long-term disease-free intervals, high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) 
and more recently anti-CTLA-4, work through activation of the immune system. 
However, with both therapies the response rate is low. Advances in our knowledge 
of how the immune system interacts with cancer have led to a number of 
strategies to manipulate anti-tumor immune responses through immunotherapy. This 
review will focus on one avenue of immunotherapy using the transfer of T cells 
referred to as "adoptive cell therapy" (ACT), which involves the ex vivo 
expansion of autologous tumor-specific T cells to large numbers that are 
ultimately transferred back to the patient to boost anti-tumor immunity. This 
approach has been shown to be effective in the treatment of virally induced 
cancers, as well as metastatic melanoma. Recent successes with ACT hold promise 
and further emphasize the tremendous potential benefit of harnessing the immune 
system in the fight against cancer.
