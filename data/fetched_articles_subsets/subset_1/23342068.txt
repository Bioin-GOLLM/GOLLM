Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital malformation of the hindgut 
resulting from a disruption of neural crest cell migration during embryonic 
development. It has a complex genetic aetiology with several genes involved in 
its pathogenesis. PHOX2B plays a key function in the development of neural crest 
derivatives, and heterozygous mutations cause a complex dysautonomia associating 
HSCR, Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) and neuroblastoma (NB) 
in various combinations. In order to determine the role of PHOX2B in isolated 
HSCR, we performed a mutational screening in a cohort of 207 Spanish HSCR 
patients. Our most relevant finding has been the identification of a de novo and 
novel deletion (c.393_410del18) in a patient with HSCR. Results of in silico and 
functional assays support its pathogenic effect related to HSCR. Therefore our 
results support that PHOX2B loss-of-function is a rare cause of HSCR phenotype.
