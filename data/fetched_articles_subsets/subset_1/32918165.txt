PURPOSE: To describe the development of progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML) in a patient with primary immune deficiency (PID) due 
to a NFKB1 (nuclear factor kB subunit 1) mutation, who was treated successfully 
with a combination of mirtazapine and mefloquine.
METHODS: We've based the treatment of our patient on literature research and 
provide a review of PML in CVID patients.
RESULTS: Only a few reports have been published on the occurrence of PML in PID. 
PML is mainly observed in patients with reduced cellular immunity, which was not 
the case in our patient. Successful treatment options in this population are 
limited. Though severely disabled, our patient still survives, more than 4 years 
after symptom onset and shows consistent improvement on MRI (magnetic resonance 
imaging) and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) analysis.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that some patients with PML might be treatable and can 
show long-term survival although neurological deficits remain. Involvement of 
humoral immunity in the pathogenesis of PML as well as the possible role of 
NFKB1 mutations in response to specific pathogens deserves further 
investigation.
