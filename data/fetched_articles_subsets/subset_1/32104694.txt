Introduction. The biological roles of microRNA-654-5p (miR-654-5p) in cancers 
have been previously reported. However, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
remains largely unknown. The purpose of this work was to investigate the roles 
and associated mechanisms in CRC.
METHODS: Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to explore the 
expression pattern of miR-654-5p in CRC cells. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) 
assay, wound-healing assay, and transwell invasion assay were conducted to 
investigate the effects of miR-654-5p on CRC cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion, respectively. Moreover, the mechanisms behind miR-654-5p regulates CRC 
progression were investigated.
RESULTS: Compared with normal cell line, miR-654-5p expression level was 
significantly suppressed in CRC cells. After overexpression of miR-654-5p, the 
malignancy behaviors of CRC cells including cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion were remarkably decreased. Subsequently, we found hematopoietic 
cell-specific protein 1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was a putative target for 
miR-654-5p. Rescue experiments showed overexpression of HAX-1 could partially 
reversed the effects of miR-654-4p on CRC cell events.
CONCLUSION: miR-654-5p was reduced expression in CRC cells and could regulate 
CRC progression via targeting HAX-1.
