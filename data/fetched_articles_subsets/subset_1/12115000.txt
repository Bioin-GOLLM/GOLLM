HEL cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line, mainly express fetal globin 
gene(gamma) and small amount of the embryonic(epsilon) globin gene, but not the 
adult (beta) globin gene. Our previous studies demonstrated that hydroxyurea 
could induce HEL cells to express adult (beta) globin gene and induce HEL cells 
to terminal differentiation. In order to reveal the differentiation mechanism of 
HEL cells induced by hydroxyurea, GMSA was performed to examine the binding of 
nuclear extracts from hydroxyurea induced and uninduced HEL cells to the 
positive control region in the 5'-flanking sequence of human beta-globin gene 
and to the synthesized GATA oligonucleotides. Our results showed that, in the 
nuclear proteins from the induced HEL cells, the binding of GATA-1 to GATA motif 
was increased. However, the binding of GATA-2 to GATA motif was decreased. 
Besides, our data showed that a YY1-like protein was decreased quickly in 
hydroxyurea induced HEL cells. Western blotting analysis was used to analyze 
variation of GATA proteins in nuclei of HEL cells. Results revealed that the 
amount of GATA-2 was significantly decreased while the amount of GATA-1 was 
increased after HEL cells were induced for 12 h. These results indicate that 
GATA-1 may play a critical role in inducing HEL cells to terminal 
differentiation. The YY1-like protein and GATA-2 might inhibit HEL cells from 
terminal differentiation.
