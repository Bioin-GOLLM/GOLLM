OBJECTIVE: To identify factors independently associated with incomplete response 
to therapy based on the 2015 ATA guidelines in surgically treated Filipino 
patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective cohort study of adults aged 21-74 years 
with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) treated with surgery with or without 
radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) in Makati Medical Center from 2013 to 2017. We 
collected the following factors through a review of charts: age at diagnosis, 
gender, family history of thyroid cancer, date of surgery, tumor size, 
capsular/lymphovascular invasion, lymph node/distant metastases, stage, risk of 
recurrence, dose of post-surgical RAI therapy, initial post-treatment serum 
Thyroglobulin (Tg) and anti-Tg antibody levels (Negative Tg level: suppressed 
non-stimulated Tg <0.2 ng/mL or TSH-stimulated Tg <1 ng/mL; Positive Tg level: 
suppressed Tg ≥1 ng/mL or a TSH-stimulated Tg ≥10 ng/mL or rising anti-Tg 
antibody levels), thyroid stimulating hormone suppression, post-operative 
imaging studies and levothyroxine dose. Response to therapy was checked 6-24 
months post-therapy.
RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 115 patients with PTC who underwent 
thyroidectomy. Patients who had family history of thyroid cancer were less 
likely to have an incomplete or indeterminate response (p=0.045). None of the 
patients with excellent response had lymphovascular invasion. Having a positive 
Tg (p=0.001) and positive anti-Tg post-operatively (p<0.001) were strongly 
associated with incomplete or indeterminate response.
CONCLUSION: Patients who were positive for thyroglobulin and anti-thyroglobulin 
post-operatively were strongly associated with incomplete or indeterminate 
response to therapy in PTC.
