RATIONALE: Hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumor (HOCT) is defined as tumor 
composed of renal oncocytoma (RO) and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (CHRCC). 
Sporadic HOCT is extremely rare, the preoperative diagnosis is difficult, and no 
guidelines for clinical therapy. We report a case who is the youngest male 
patient of sporadic HOCT in the world, review the previously reported cases, and 
share the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of HOCT.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 30-year-old man was admitted with the complaints of 
incidental right renal tumor detected by abdominal ultrasound. He had no 
complaints of urological symptoms, abdominal pain, osphyalgia, and hematuria. 
Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed an 85 mm × 80 
mm × 80 mm unilateral and solid renal mass, and no findings of metastases.
DIAGNOSIS: The preoperative diagnosis was right renal tumor.
INTERVENTIONS: Laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy was performed.
OUTCOMES: Histopathology demonstrated a mixture of cells with the morphologic 
features of those seen in CHRCC and RO. The patient was final diagnosed as 
sporadic HOCT. After follow-up of 14 months, the patient had no complaints and 
evidence of disease recurrence.
LESSONS: Sporadic HOCT is extremely rare. It is possible that core biopsy could 
improve diagnostic accuracy. Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy or nephron sparing 
surgery should be considered the clinical therapy of the sporadic HOCT patients. 
The clinical behavior of HOCT is still entirely uncertain and should be proved 
by studies with available long follow-up.
