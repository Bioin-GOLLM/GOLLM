WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Essential hypertension (EH) is a common disease 
exhibiting large individual difference in occurrence, development and treatment 
response. Genetic factors are implicated in the development and progression of 
EH. This study aimed to explore the association between NPR3 single nucleotide 
polymorphism rs2270915 (A/G, Asn521Asp) and the risk of EH in a Chinese Han 
population by a case-control study.
METHODS: The study was a single-centre, case-control trial, in which a total of 
287 EH patients and 289 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. The 
inclusion criteria were as follows: Han Chinese origin, male or female patients, 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
≥90 mm Hg. The healthy controls were subjects without histories of 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. NPR3 rs2270915 polymorphism was 
genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(PCR-RFLP). In addition, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) 
were isolated from 19 fresh human umbilical cords and cultured. Atrial 
natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration in cell medium was determined by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NPR3 mRNA expression was determined 
by real-time semi-quantitative PCR.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: No significant difference in genotype distribution of 
NPR3 rs2270915 polymorphism was observed between cases and controls (P>.05). 
Patients carrying the rs2270915 G allele showed decreased SBP, and the 
difference was marginal. As compared with cells carrying the rs2270915 AA 
genotype, those with the AG genotype showed significantly lower NPR3 mRNA 
expression levels (P<.05) and lower medium ANP concentration (P<.001).
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This study suggested that NPR3 rs2270915 
polymorphism was associated with decreased SBP level marginally in EH patients 
in a Chinese Han population, and the polymorphism may function through 
decreasing NPR3 mRNA expression and ANP level.
