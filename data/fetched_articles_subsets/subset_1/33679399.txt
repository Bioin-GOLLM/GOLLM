Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a worldwide burden due to 
the high co-morbidity and mortality. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the 
leading causes of CKD, and pre-dialysis is one of the most critical stages 
before the end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although Chinese herbal medicine 
(CHM) use is not uncommon, the feasibility of using CHM among pre-dialysis DN 
patients remains unclear. Materials and methods: We analyzed a population-based 
cohort, retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, to 
study the long-term outcome of using CHM among incident pre-dialysis DN patients 
from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2007. All patients were followed up to 
5 years or the occurrence of mortality. The risks of all-cause mortality and 
ESRD were carried out using Kaplan-Meier and competing risk estimation, 
respectively. Further, we demonstrated the CHM prescriptions and core CHMs using 
the Chinese herbal medicine network (CMN) analysis. Results: A total of 6,648 
incident pre-dialysis DN patients were analyzed, including 877 CHM users and 
5,771 CHM nonusers. With overlap weighing for balancing all accessible 
covariates between CHM users and nonusers, we found the use of CHM was 
associated with lower all-cause mortality (0.22 versus 0.56; log-rank test: 
p-value <0.001), and the risk of mortality was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.36-0.49; p-value 
<0.001) by adjusting all accessible covariates. Further, the use of CHM was 
associated with a lower risk of ESRD (cause-specific hazard ratio: 0.59, 95%CI: 
0.55-0.63; p-value <0.001). Also, from the 5,901 CHM prescriptions, we found 
Ji-Sheng-Shen-Qi-Wan, Astragalus mongholicus Bunge or (Astragalus membranaceus 
(Fisch.) Bge.), Plantago asiatica L. (or Plantago depressa Willd.), Salvia 
miltiorrhiza Bunge, and Rheum palmatum L. (or Rheum tanguticum (Maxim. ex Regel) 
Balf., Rheum officinale Baill.) were used as core CHMs for different CHM 
indications. Use of core CHMs was associated with a lower risk of mortality than 
CHM users without using core CHMs. Conclusions: The use of CHM seemed feasible 
among pre-dialysis DN patients; however, the beneficial effects still need to be 
validated by well-designed clinical trials.
