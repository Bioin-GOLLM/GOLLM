Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients show a myriad of energetic 
abnormalities, such as weight loss, hypermetabolism, and dyslipidaemia. Evidence 
suggests that these indices correlate with and ultimately affect the duration of 
survival. This review aims to discuss ALS metabolic abnormalities in the context 
of autophagy, the primordial system acting at the cellular level for energy 
production during nutrient deficiency. As the primary pathway of protein 
degradation in eukaryotic cells, the fundamental role of cellular autophagy is 
the adaptation to metabolic demands. Therefore, autophagy is tightly coupled to 
cellular metabolism. We review evidence that the delicate balance between 
autophagy and metabolism is aberrant in ALS, giving rise to intracellular and 
systemic pathophysiology observations. Understanding the metabolism autophagy 
crosstalk can lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for ALS.
