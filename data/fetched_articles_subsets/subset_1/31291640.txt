BACKGROUND/AIMS: The association between ACYP2(Acylphosphatase 2) polymorphisms 
and immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) risk in the Chinese Han population 
remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the association between ACYP2 
polymorphisms and IgAN risk by performing a case-control study.
METHODS: Eleven ACYP2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 416 IgAN 
patients and 495 healthy controls were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY 
platform. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to 
evaluate the association of ACYP2 polymorphisms with IgAN risk.
RESULTS: We observed that rs843720 was significantly associated with an 
increased risk of IgAN (allele G: OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01-1.49, p = 0.036; 
dominant model: OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.01-2.37, p =0.044; log-additive model: OR = 
1.43, 95% CI: 1.04-1.95, p = 0.026) before Bonferroni correction. The SNP 
rs12615793 was also significantly associated with an increased IgAN risk in the 
recessive model (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.05-10.51, p = 0.042) before Bonferroni 
correction.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that polymorphisms (rs843720 and 
rs12615793) of ACYP2 may be pivotal in the development of IgAN. However, more 
functional and association studies with larger sample sizes should be performed 
to further validate our results in the future.
