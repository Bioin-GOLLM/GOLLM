BACKGROUND: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) provide a foundation for robust and 
continual spermatogenesis in mammals. SSCs self-renew to maintain a functional 
stem cell pool and differentiate to supply committed progenitors. Metabolism 
acts as a crucial determinant of stem cell fates; however, factors linking 
metabolic programs to SSC development and maintenance are poorly understood.
RESULTS: We analyzed the chromatin accessibility of undifferentiated 
spermatogonia at the single-cell level and identified 37 positive TF regulators 
that may have potential roles in dictating SSC fates. The transcription factor 
E4F1 is expressed in spermatogonia, and its conditional deletion in mouse germ 
cells results in progressive loss of the entire undifferentiated spermatogonial 
pool. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of control and E4f1-deficient spermatogonia 
revealed that E4F1 acts as a key regulator of mitochondrial function. E4F1 binds 
to promotors of genes that encode components of the mitochondrial respiratory 
chain, including Ndufs5, Cox7a2, Cox6c, and Dnajc19. Loss of E4f1 function 
caused abnormal mitochondrial morphology and defects in fatty acid metabolism; 
as a result, undifferentiated spermatogonia were gradually lost due to cell 
cycle arrest and elevated apoptosis. Deletion of p53 in E4f1-deficient germ 
cells only temporarily prevented spermatogonial loss but did not rescue the 
defects in SSC maintenance.
CONCLUSIONS: Emerging evidence indicates that metabolic signals dictate stem 
cell fate decisions. In this study, we identified a list of transcription 
regulators that have potential roles in the fate transitions of undifferentiated 
spermatogonia in mice. Functional experiments demonstrated that the 
E4F1-mediated transcription program is a crucial regulator of metabolism and SSC 
fate decisions in mammals.
