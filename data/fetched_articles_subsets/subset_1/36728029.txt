Cell membrane repair is a critical process used to maintain cell integrity and 
survival from potentially lethal chemical, and mechanical membrane injury. Rapid 
increases in local calcium levels due to a membrane rupture have been widely 
accepted as a trigger for multiple membrane-resealing models that utilize 
exocytosis, endocytosis, patching, and shedding mechanisms. Calcium-sensor 
proteins, such as synaptotagmins (Syt), dysferlin, S100 proteins, and annexins, 
have all been identified to regulate, or participate in, multiple modes of 
membrane repair. Dysfunction of membrane repair from inefficiencies or genetic 
alterations in these proteins contributes to diseases such as muscular dystrophy 
(MD) and heart disease. The present review covers the role of some of the key 
calcium-sensor proteins and their involvement in membrane repair.
