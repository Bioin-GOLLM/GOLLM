OBJECTIVE: This study (1) examined pubertal development in relation to 
actigraphy-assessed sleep in twin children, and tested whether associations 
differed by child race and gender, (2) modeled genetic and environmental 
influences on pubertal development and sleep indicators, and (3) examined 
genetic and environmental influences on the covariation of puberty and sleep.
DESIGN: The classic twin design was used to examine genetic and environmental 
contributions to puberty and sleep and their associations.
SETTING: Data were collected from community-dwelling urban and rural families of 
twins in the southwestern U.S.
PARTICIPANTS: The racially and socioeconomically diverse sample included 596 
twin children (Mage = 8.41, SD = 0.69; 51.7% female; 66.3% white; 33.7% 
Hispanic; 170 monozygotic, 236 same-sex dizygotic, 188 opposite-sex dizygotic).
MEASUREMENTS: Pubertal development was assessed via parent report. Children wore 
actigraph watches for 7 nights (M = 6.81, SD = 0.67) to capture sleep duration, 
efficiency, midpoint, onset latency, and duration variability.
RESULTS: In contrast to extant literature with older youth, more advanced 
pubertal development was associated with longer sleep durations in Hispanic and 
white girls and higher sleep efficiency in white girls, though Hispanic girls 
demonstrated later sleep midpoints. Pubertal development was moderately 
heritable and there was a genetic influence on the covariance between puberty 
and sleep indicators.
CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to examine the genetic and environmental 
influences on the covariation between puberty and sleep, and found genetic 
underpinnings between pubertal development and actigraphy-assessed sleep 
duration and efficiency, though sleep and puberty were almost entirely 
independent in twins at this age.
