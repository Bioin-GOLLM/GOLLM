COPA (coatomer subunit α) syndrome is a newly recognised cause of interstitial 
lung disease in children and adults, frequently associated with arthritis and 
renal dysfunction. We report a 11-year-old girl with disease limited to major 
pulmonary haemosiderosis manifesting at the age of 2 years, due to a 
heterozygous p.(Arg233His) mutation in COPA Her interferon (IFN) signature was 
elevated (10.312 and 12.429, healthy <2.466), as was the level of serum IFNα 
(211 fg/mL, healthy <10 fg/mL). STAT1 phosphorylation in T lymphocytes and 
monocytes was increased as compared with healthy controls. Based on these 
results she was treated with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, which resulted in 
reduction in IFN signalling and appeared to be associated with partial though 
incomplete decrease in the severity of her pulmonary disease. Patients with 
alveolar haemorrhage of unknown origin should be considered for COPA screening. 
Functional tests can help to personalise patient therapy.
