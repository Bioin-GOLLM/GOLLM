Beta-defensins are both antimicrobial and able to chemoattract various immune 
cells including immature dendritic cells and CD4 T cells through CCR6. They are 
short, cationic peptides with a highly conserved six-cysteine motif. It has been 
shown that only the fifth cysteine is critical for chemoattraction of cells 
expressing CCR6. In order to identify other residues essential for functional 
interaction with CCR6 we used a library of peptide deletion derivatives based on 
Defb14. Loss of the initial two amino acids from the Defb14-1C(V) derivative 
destroys its ability to chemoattract cells expressing CCR6. As the second amino 
acid is an evolutionarily conserved leucine, we make full-length Defb14-1C(V) 
peptides with substitution of the leucine(2) for glycine (L2G), lysine (L2K) or 
isoleucine (L2I). Defb14-1C(V) L2G and L2K and are unable to chemoattract CCR6 
expressing cells but the semi-conservative change L2I has activity. By circular 
dichroism spectroscopy we can see no evidence for a significant change in 
secondary structure as a consequence of these substitutions and so cannot 
attribute loss of chemotactic activity with disruption of the N-terminal helix. 
We conclude that isoleucine/leucine in the N-terminal alpha-helix region of this 
beta-defensin is essential for CCR6-mediated chemotaxis.
