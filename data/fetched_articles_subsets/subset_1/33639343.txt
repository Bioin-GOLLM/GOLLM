Prior modification of betulinic acid (1), a natural product lead with promising 
anti-HIV activity, produced 3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)betulinic acid 
(bevirimat, 3), the first-in-class HIV maturation inhibitor. After 3-resistant 
variants were found during Phase I and IIa clinical trials, further modification 
of 3 produced 4 with improved activity against wild-type and 3-resistant HIV-1. 
In continued efforts to optimize 1, 63 final products have now been designed, 
synthesized, and evaluated for anti-HIV-1 replication activity against 
HIV-1NL4-3 infected MT-4 cell lines. Five known and 21 new derivatives were as 
or more potent than 3 (EC50 0.065 μM), while eight new derivatives were as or 
more potent than 4 (EC50 0.019 μM). These derivatives feature expanded 
structural diversity and chemical space that may improve the antiviral activity 
and address the growing resistance crisis. Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) 
correlations were thoroughly analyzed, and a 3D Quantitative SAR model with high 
predictability was constructed to facilitate further rational design and 
development of new potent derivatives.
