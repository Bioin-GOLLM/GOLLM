OBJECTIVES: The emergency department (ED) is a challenging setting to conduct 
pharmacogenomic studies and integrate that data into fast-paced and potentially 
life-saving treatment decisions. Therefore, our objective is to present the 
methods and feasibility of a pilot pharmacogenomic study set in the ED that 
measured pediatric bronchodilator response (BDR) during acute asthma 
exacerbations.
METHODS: This is an exploratory pilot study that collected buccal swabs for DNA 
and measured BDR during ED encounters for pediatric asthma exacerbations. We 
evaluated the study's feasibility with a qualitative analysis of ED provider 
surveys and quantitatively by the proportion of eligible patients enrolled.
RESULTS: We enrolled 59 out of 90 patients (65%) that were identified and 
considered eligible during a 5-month period (target enrollment 60 patients over 
12 months). The median patient age was 7 years (interquartile range 4-9 years), 
61% (N = 36) were male, and 92% (N = 54) were African American. Quality DNA 
collection was successful for all 59 patients. The ED provider survey response 
rate was 100%. Most ED providers reported that the study did not impact their 
workflow (98% of physicians, 88% of nurses, and 90% of respiratory therapists). 
ED providers did report difficulties with spirometry in the younger age group.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacogenomic studies can be conducted in the ED setting, and 
enroll a younger patient population with a high proportion of minority 
participants. By disseminating this study's methods and feasibility analysis, we 
aim to increase interest in pharmacogenomic studies set in the ED and aimed 
toward future ED-based pharmacogenomic decision-making.
