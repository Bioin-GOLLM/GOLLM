Influenza pandemic occurs when a new strain from other animal species overcomes 
the inter-species barriers and supports rapid human-to-human transmission. A 
critical prerequisite to this process is that hemagglutinin (HA) acquires a few 
key mutations to switch from avian receptors to human receptors. Previous 
studies suggest that H1 and H2/H3 HAs use different sets of mutations for the 
switch. This report shows that HA from the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus (1918H1 HA) 
adopts the set of mutations used by H2/H3 HAs in receptor-preference switch when 
its 130-loop is made similar to those of H2/H3 HAs. Thus, the 130-loop appears 
to be the key determinant for the different mutations employed by pandemic H1 or 
H2/H3 HA. The correlation of the mutational routes and the 130-loop as unraveled 
in this study opens the door for efficient investigation of mutations required 
by other HA subtypes for inter-human airborne transmission.
