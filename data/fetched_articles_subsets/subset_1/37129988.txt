An inversion method for time-resolved data from ultrafast experiments is 
introduced, based on forward-optimization in a trajectory basis. The method is 
applied to experimental data from X-ray scattering of the photochemical 
ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and electron diffraction of the 
photodissociation of CS2. In each case, inversion yields a model that reproduces 
the experimental data, identifies the main dynamic motifs, and agrees with 
independent experimental observations. Notably, the method explicitly accounts 
for continuity constraints and is robust even for noisy data.
