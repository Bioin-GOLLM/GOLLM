Connexin37-mediated regulation of cell cycle modulators and, consequently, 
growth arrest lack mechanistic understanding. We previously showed that arterial 
shear stress up-regulates Cx37 in endothelial cells and activates a 
Notch/Cx37/p27 signaling axis to promote G1 cell cycle arrest, and this is 
required to enable arterial gene expression. However, how induced expression of 
a gap junction protein, Cx37, up-regulates cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 
to enable endothelial growth suppression and arterial specification is unclear. 
Herein, we fill this knowledge gap by expressing wild-type and regulatory domain 
mutants of Cx37 in cultured endothelial cells expressing the Fucci cell cycle 
reporter. We determined that both the channel-forming and cytoplasmic tail 
domains of Cx37 are required for p27 up-regulation and late G1 arrest. 
Mechanistically, the cytoplasmic tail domain of Cx37 interacts with, and 
sequesters, activated ERK in the cytoplasm. This then stabilizes pERK nuclear 
target Foxo3a, which up-regulates p27 transcription. Consistent with previous 
studies, we found this Cx37/pERK/Foxo3a/p27 signaling axis functions downstream 
of arterial shear stress to promote endothelial late G1 state and enable 
up-regulation of arterial genes.
