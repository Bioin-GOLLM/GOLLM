The function of IM30 (also known as Vipp1) is linked to protection and/or 
remodeling of the thylakoid membrane system in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. 
Recently, it has been revealed that the Arabidopsis IM30 protein exhibits GTP 
hydrolyzing activity in vitro, which was unexpected, as IM30 does not show any 
classical GTPase features. In the present study, we addressed the question, 
whether an apparent GTPase activity is conserved in IM30 proteins and can also 
be observed for IM30 of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We show 
that Synechocystis IM30 is indeed able to bind and hydrolyze GTP followed by the 
release of Pi. Yet, the apparent GTPase activity of Synechocystis IM30 does not 
depend on Mg2+, which, together with the lack of classical GTPase features, 
renders IM30 an atypical GTPase. To elucidate the impact of this cryptic GTPase 
activity on the membrane remodeling activity of IM30, we tested whether GTP 
hydrolysis influences IM30 membrane binding and/or IM30-mediated membrane 
fusion. We show that membrane remodeling by Synechocystis IM30 is slightly 
affected by nucleotides. Yet, despite IM30 clearly catalyzing GTP hydrolysis, 
this does not seem to be vital for its membrane remodeling function.
