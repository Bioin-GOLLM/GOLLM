Human apolipoprotein A-IV exhibits a polymorphism, first investigated at the 
protein level, that is caused by a single amino acid substitution of glutamine 
to histidine at codon 360. Detection of this polymorphism requires polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing of the amplified products, 
radiolabeled allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASOs) technique, or restriction 
enzyme analysis of the amplified products. However, these techniques involve the 
use of radioactivity and/or are not well suited to the rapid processing of a 
large number of samples. In this paper, we propose a new technique, a 
bispecific-allele primer amplification, in which a simple electrophoresis of PCR 
products is used for typing the variation at codon 360. The 3' primer of PCR 
hybridizes with one or other homologous sequence in the apoA-IV gene, depending 
on the presence or the absence of the mutation. This differential hybridization 
of the primer is used for typing the variation. In order to demonstrate the 
validity of this system, 120 individuals phenotyped by two-dimensional 
electrophoresis and genotyped by ASO were analyzed by this new technique. The 
results obtained by the latter method are in agreement with those found by the 
other techniques. However, this method is simple, more reliable, and will 
facilitate population studies without using radioactive materials.
