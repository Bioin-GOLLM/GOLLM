The cytoplasmic surface of Drosophila melanogaster Rh1 rhodopsin (ninaE) 
harbours amino acids which are highly conserved among G-protein-coupled 
receptors. Site-directed mutations which cause Leu81Gln or Asn86Ile amino acid 
substitutions in the first cytoplasmic loop of the Rh1 opsin protein, are shown 
to block rhodopsin synthesis in the nascent, glycosylated state from which the 
mutant opsin is degraded rapidly. In mutants Leu81Gln and Asn86Ile, only 20-30% 
and <2% respectively, of functional rhodopsins are synthesized and transported 
to the photoreceptive membrane. Thus, conserved amino acids in opsin's 
cytoplasmic surface are a critical factor in the interaction of opsin with 
proteins of the rhodopsin processing machinery. Photoreceptor cells expressing 
mutant rhodopsins undergo age-dependent degeneration in a recessive manner.
