BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Dubin Johnson Syndrome (DJS) occurs mostly in young 
adults but an early-onset of the disease has been reported in less common forms 
(Neonatal DJS and Infantile DJS). In this case, the clinical findings are of 
limit for the DJS diagnosis. Hence, the genetic testing remains the method of 
choice to provide an accurate diagnosis. In our study, we aimed to perform a 
genetic analysis for two siblings presented with an intrahepatic cholestasis 
before the age of 1 year to provide a molecular explanation for the developed 
phenotype.
PATIENTS & METHODS: A Tunisian family, having two siblings, manifesting signs of 
a hepatopathy, was enrolled in our study. A molecular analysis was performed, 
using a panel-based next generation sequencing, supplying results that were the 
subject of computational analysis. Then, a clinical follow-up was carried out to 
assess the evolution of the disease.
RESULTS: The genetic analysis revealed the presence of a novel missense 
c.4179G > T, (p.M1393I) mutation in ABCC2 gene associated with a substitution 
c.2789G > A (R930Q) in ATP8B1 gene. Predictive results consolidated the 
pathogenic effect of both variants. These results confirmed the DJS diagnosis in 
the studied patients. The clinical course of both patients fit well with the 
benign nature of DJS.
CONCLUSION: We described here a novel ABCC2 mutation associated with a putative 
ATP8B1 modifier variant. This finding constituted the first report of a complex 
genotype in DJS. Hence, genetic analysis by a panel-based next generation 
sequencing permits an accurate diagnosis and the identification of putative 
variants that could influence the developed phenotype.
