PURPOSE: Graves' disease (GD) is a multigenic, organ specific autoimmune 
disorder with a strong genetic predisposition and IL-1β has been shown to be 
involved in its pathogenesis. The present study was aimed to determine the 
genetic associations between polymorphisms of IL-1β gene promoter region 
(-511 T>C) (rs16944), exon 5 (+3954 C>T) (rs1143634) and IL-1RN gene VNTR 
(rs2234663) polymorphism in patients with GD in ethnic Kashmiri population.
METHODS: A total of 135 Graves' disease patients and 150 healthy individuals 
were included in the study. PCR and PCR-based restriction analysis methods were 
done for IL-1RNVNTR and IL-1β gene polymorphisms respectively.
RESULTS: We found statistically significant increased frequencies of the 
C/C + CT genotype (P = 0.001; odds ratio (OR) = 5.04, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 3.02-8.42) and the C allele (P = 0.001; OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 2.14-4.50) in 
IL-1β gene promoter polymorphism (rs16944) with GD patients compared to normal 
controls. Also in the exon 5 (rs1143634), a significant increase in frequency of 
the C/C homozygous genotype (P = 0.001; OR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.11-0.30) and C 
allele (P = 0.001; OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.20-0.48) was observed in GD cases as 
against controls. For IL-1RNVNTR (rs2234663), we didn't observe any significant 
difference in the allelic and genotypic frequencies between cases and controls.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that both promoter and exon polymorphisms of 
IL-1β gene have a significant role in the risk of developing GD, whereas 
IL-1RNVNTR has no association with GD.
