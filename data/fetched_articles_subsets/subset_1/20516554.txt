BACKGROUND: Children remain under-represented in national antiretroviral 
treatment (ART) programmes in settings with limited resources and high HIV 
prevalence. In Malawi, an increasing number of HIV-infected children have been 
started on ART with split tablets of an adult fixed-dose combination drug in the 
past few years. In 2006, the national paediatric ART regime was changed from 
Triomune 40 (T40) to Triomune 30 (T30).
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the paediatric ART clinic 
in Blantyre (Malawi) from September 2006 to July 2007. Children taking T30 for > 
6 weeks from each dosing weight band (<5, 5-<8, 8-<12, 12-<14, 14-<19, 19-<26, 
26-<30 and > or = 30 kg) were recruited. Plasma drug concentration, CD4+ T-cell 
count and HIV viral load were measured.
RESULTS: A total of 74 children were analysed. The median nevirapine (NVP) 
concentration was 7.35 mg/l. A therapeutic NVP plasma level > 3 mg/l was found 
in 62 (87.8%) children. A subtherapeutic NVP level (< 3 mg/l) occurred 
significantly more often in children treated with T30 doses between one-quarter 
tablet once daily and one-half tablet twice daily (P=0.035). Median prescribed 
NVP dose was 342 mg/m(2)/day, but 13 (17.6%) children received a dose below the 
recommended dose of 300 mg/m(2)/day. Compared with a historical control, the 
median prescribed NVP dose was increased (from 243 to 342 mg/m(2)/day).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that with the Malawian T30-based ART regime, 
the majority (87.8%) of children in the study group achieved a therapeutic NVP 
level. However, treatment remains suboptimal especially for young children 
receiving T30 dosages less than or equal to one-half tablets twice daily and 
child appropriate formulations are warranted.
