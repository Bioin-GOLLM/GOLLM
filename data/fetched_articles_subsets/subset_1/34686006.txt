Himatanthus sucuuba, also known as "Bellaco caspi", is a medicinal plant whose 
latex, stem bark, and leaves possess phenolic acids, lupeol, 
β-dihydro-plumbericinic acid, plumericin, and plumeride, among other components. 
Some of these have been linked to such biological activities as antiulcer, 
anti-inflammatory, and wound healing. The aim of this study was to determine the 
phytochemical compounds of H. sucuuba latex, as well as its in vitro 
cytotoxicity and wound healing effect in mice. Latex was collected in the 
province of Iquitos, Peru. Phytochemical analysis was carried out with 
UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on two colon tumor cell lines 
(SW480 and SW620) and non-malignant cells (human keratinocytes, HaCaT, and 
Chinese hamster ovary, CHO-K1). The mice were distributed into two groups, as 
follows: Group I-control (n = 10; without treatment); II-(n = 10) H. sucuuba 
latex; wounds were induced with a scalpel in the dorsal-cervical area and 
treatments were applied topically twice a day on the incision for 10 days. 
Molecular docking was carried out on the glycogen synthase kinase 3β protein. 
Twenty-four chemical compounds were determined, mainly flavonoid-type compounds. 
Latex did not have a cytotoxic effect on tumor cells with IC50 values of more 
than 500 µg/mL. The latex had a regenerative effect on wounds in mice. 
Acacetin-7-O-neohesperidoside had the best docking score of -9.9 kcal/mol. In 
conclusion, H. sucuuba latex had a wound healing effect in mice, as confirmed by 
histological study. However, a non-cytotoxic effect was observed on colon tumor 
cells SW480 and SW620.
