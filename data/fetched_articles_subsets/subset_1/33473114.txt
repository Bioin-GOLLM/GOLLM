Osteoarthritis causes debilitating pain and disability, resulting in a 
considerable socioeconomic burden, yet no drugs are available that prevent 
disease onset or progression. Here, we develop, validate and use 
rapid-throughput imaging techniques to identify abnormal joint phenotypes in 
randomly selected mutant mice generated by the International Knockout Mouse 
Consortium. We identify 14 genes with functional involvement in osteoarthritis 
pathogenesis, including the homeobox gene Pitx1, and functionally characterize 6 
candidate human osteoarthritis genes in mouse models. We demonstrate sensitivity 
of the methods by identifying age-related degenerative joint damage in wild-type 
mice. Finally, we phenotype previously generated mutant mice with an 
osteoarthritis-associated polymorphism in the Dio2 gene by CRISPR/Cas9 genome 
editing and demonstrate a protective role in disease onset with public health 
implications. We hope this expanding resource of mutant mice will accelerate 
functional gene discovery in osteoarthritis and offer drug discovery 
opportunities for this common, incapacitating chronic disease.
