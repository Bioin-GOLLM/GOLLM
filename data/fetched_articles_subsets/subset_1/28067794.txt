Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most fatal human cancers 
due to its complicated genomic instability. PDAC frequently presents at an 
advanced stage with extensive metastasis, which portends a poor prognosis. The 
known risk factors associated with PDAC include advanced age, smoking, 
long-standing chronic pancreatitis, obesity, and diabetes. Its association with 
genomic and somatic mutations is the most important factor for its 
aggressiveness. The most common gene mutations associated with PDAC include 
KRas2, p16, TP53, and Smad4. Among these, Smad4 mutation is relatively specific 
and its inactivation is found in more than 50% of invasive pancreatic 
adenocarcinomas. Smad4 is a member of the Smad family of signal transducers and 
acts as a central mediator of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling 
pathways. The TGF-β signaling pathway promotes many physiological processes, 
including cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, fibrosis, and scar 
formation. It also plays a major role in the development of tumors through 
induction of angiogenesis and immune suppression. In this review, we will 
discuss the molecular mechanism of TGF-β/Smad4 signaling in the pathogenesis of 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma and its clinical implication, particularly potential 
as a prognostic factor and a therapeutic target.
