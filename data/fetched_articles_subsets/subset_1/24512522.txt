BACKGROUND: Esterases are often overexpressed in cancer cells and can have 
chiral specificities different from that of the corresponding normal tissues. 
For this reason, ester prodrugs could be a promising approach in chemotherapy. 
In this study, we focused on the identification and characterization of 
differentially expressed esterases between non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic 
prostate epithelial cells.
METHODS: Cellular lysates from LNCaP, DU 145, and PC3 prostate cancer cell 
lines, tumorigenic RWPE-2 prostate epithelial cells, and non-tumorigenic RWPE-1 
prostate epithelial cells were separated by native polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (n-PAGE) and the esterase activity bands visualized using 
α-naphthyl acetate or α-naphthyl-N-acetylalaninate (ANAA) chiral esters and Fast 
Blue RR salt. The esterases were identified using nanospray LC/MS-MS tandem mass 
spectrometry and confirmed by Western blotting, native electroblotting, 
inhibition assays, and activity towards a known specific substrate. The serine 
protease/esterase oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH) was overexpressed in COS-7 
cells to verify our results.
RESULTS: The major esterase observed with the ANAA substrates within the n-PAGE 
activity bands was identified as OPH. OPH (EC 3.4.19.1) is a serine 
protease/esterase and a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase family. We found 
that LNCaP lysates contained approximately 40% more OPH compared to RWPE-1 
lysates. RWPE-2, DU145 and PC3 cell lysates had similar levels of OPH activity. 
OPH within all of the cell lysates tested had a chiral preference for the 
S-isomer of ANAA. LNCaP cells were stained more intensely with ANAA substrates 
than RWPE-1 cells and COS-7 cells overexpressing OPH were found to have a higher 
activity towards the ANAA and AcApNA than parent COS-7 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that prodrug derivatives of ANAA and AcApNA 
could have potential as chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of prostate 
cancer tumors that overexpress OPH.
