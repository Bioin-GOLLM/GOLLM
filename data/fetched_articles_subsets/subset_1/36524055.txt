Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on atomic models play an 
increasingly important role in a wide range of applications in physics, biology, 
and chemistry. Nonetheless, generating genuine knowledge about biological 
systems using MD simulations remains challenging. Protein tyrosine kinases are 
important cellular signaling enzymes that regulate cell growth, proliferation, 
metabolism, differentiation, and migration. Due to the large conformational 
changes and long timescales involved in their function, these kinases present 
particularly challenging problems to modern computational and theoretical 
frameworks aimed at elucidating the dynamics of complex biomolecular systems. 
Markov state models have achieved limited success in tackling the broader 
conformational ensemble and biased methods are often employed to examine 
specific long timescale events. Recent advances in machine learning continue to 
push the limitations of current methodologies and provide notable improvements 
when integrated with the existing frameworks. A broad perspective is drawn from 
a critical review of recent studies.
