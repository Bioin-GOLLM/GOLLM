Improved biomaterials are required for application in regenerative medicine, 
biosensing, and as medical devices. The response of cells to the chemistry of 
polymers cultured in media is generally regarded as being dominated by proteins 
adsorbed to the surface. Here we use mass spectrometry to identify proteins 
adsorbed from a complex mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) conditioned medium 
found to support pluripotent human embryonic stem cell (hESC) expansion on a 
plasma etched tissue culture polystyrene surface. A total of 71 proteins were 
identified, of which 14 uniquely correlated with the surface on which 
pluripotent stem cell expansion was achieved. We have developed a microarray 
combinatorial protein spotting approach to test the potential of these 14 
proteins to support expansion of a hESC cell line (HUES-7) and a human induced 
pluripotent stem cell line (ReBl-PAT) on a novel polymer (N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl) 
methacrylamide). These proteins were spotted to form a primary array yielding 
several protein mixture 'hits' that enhanced cell attachment to the polymer. A 
second array was generated to test the function of a refined set of protein 
mixtures. We found that a combination of heat shock protein 90 and heat shock 
protein-1 encourage elevated adherence of pluripotent stem cells at a level 
comparable to fibronectin pre-treatment.
