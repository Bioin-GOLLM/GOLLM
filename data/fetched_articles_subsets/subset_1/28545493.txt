BACKGROUND: For the nearly 75% of patients living with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) 
that do not use insulin, decisions regarding self-monitoring of blood glucose 
(SMBG) can be especially problematic. While in theory SMBG holds great promise 
for sparking favorable behavior change, it is a resource intensive activity 
without firmly established patient benefits. This study describes our study 
protocol to assess the impact of three different SMBG testing approaches on 
patient-centered outcomes in patients with non-insulin treated T2DM within a 
community-based, clinic setting.
METHODS/DESIGN: Using stakeholder engagement approach, we developed and 
implemented a pragmatic trial of patient with non-insulin treated T2DM patients 
from five primary care practices randomized to one of three SMBG regimens: 1) no 
testing; 2) once daily testing with standard feedback consisting of glucose 
values being immediately reported to the patient through the glucose meter; and 
3) once daily testing with enhanced patient feedback consisting of glucose 
values being immediately reported to the patient PLUS automated, tailored 
feedback messaging delivered to the patient through the glucose meter following 
each testing. Main outcomes assessed at 52 weeks include quality of life and 
glycemic control.
DISCUSSION: This pragmatic trial seeks to better understand the value of SMBG in 
non-insulin treated patients with T2DM. This paper outlines the protocol used to 
implement this study in fifteen community-based primary care practices and 
highlights the impact of stakeholder involvement from the earliest stages of 
project conception and implementation. Plans for stakeholder involvement for 
result dissemination are also discussed.
