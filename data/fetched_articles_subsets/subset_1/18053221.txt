BACKGROUND: The estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ESR1, ESR2) have been 
implicated in adiposity, lipid metabolism and feeding behaviour. In this report 
we analyse ESR1 and ESR2 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 
association with obesity. We also relate adipose tissue ESR1 mRNA levels and 
ESR1 SNPs to adipocyte lipolysis and lipogenesis phenotypes.
METHODS: 23 ESR1 and 11 ESR2 tag-SNPs, covering most of the common haplotype 
variation in each gene according to HAPMAP data, were analysed by Chi2 for 
association with obesity in a cohort comprising 705 adults with severe obesity 
and 402 lean individuals. Results were replicated in a cohort comprising 837 
obese and 613 lean subjects. About 80% of both cohorts comprised women and 20% 
men. Adipose tissue ESR1 mRNA was quantified in 122 women and related to 
lipolysis and lipogenesis by multiple regression. ESR1 SNPs were analysed for 
association with adipocyte lipolysis and lipogenesis phenotypes in 204 obese 
women by simple regression.
RESULTS: No ESR1 SNP was associated with obesity. Five ESR2 SNPs displayed 
nominal significant allelic association with obesity in women and one in men. 
The two ESR2 SNPs associated with obesity with nominal P value < 0.01 were 
genotyped in a second cohort where no association with obesity was observed. 
There was an inverse correlation between ESR1 mRNA levels in abdominal 
subcutaneous (sc) adipose tissue and basal lipolysis, as well as responsiveness 
to adrenoceptor agonists independent of age and BMI (P value 0.009-0.045). ESR1 
rs532010 was associated with lipolytic sensitivity to noradrenaline (nominal P 
value 0.012), and ESR1 rs1884051 with responsiveness to the non-selective 
beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (nominal P value 0.05). These 
associations became non-significant after Bonferroni correction.
CONCLUSION: ESR1 gene alleles are unlikely to be a major cause of obesity in 
women. A minor importance of ESR2 on severe obesity cannot be excluded. The 
inverse correlation between ESR1 mRNA levels and lipolytic responsiveness to 
adrenoceptor agonists implies that low adipose tissue ESR1 levels attenuate 
catecholamine resistance in sc fat cells of obese women hereby contributing to 
loss of sc and gain of visceral fat. There is no evidence for a genetic impact 
of ESR1 on lipolysis or lipogenesis.
