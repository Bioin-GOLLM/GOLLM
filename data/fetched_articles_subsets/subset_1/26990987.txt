The death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) initiates death receptor-induced 
apoptosis. DISC assembly and activation are controlled by c-FLIP isoforms, which 
function as pro-apoptotic (c-FLIPL only) or anti-apoptotic (c-FLIPL/c-FLIPS) 
regulators of procaspase-8 activation. Current models assume that c-FLIP 
directly competes with procaspase-8 for recruitment to FADD. Using a functional 
reconstituted DISC, structure-guided mutagenesis, and quantitative LC-MS/MS, we 
show that c-FLIPL/S binding to the DISC is instead a co-operative 
procaspase-8-dependent process. FADD initially recruits procaspase-8, which in 
turn recruits and heterodimerizes with c-FLIPL/S via a hierarchical binding 
mechanism. Procaspase-8 activation is regulated by the ratio of unbound 
c-FLIPL/S to procaspase-8, which determines composition of the 
procaspase-8:c-FLIPL/S heterodimer. Thus, procaspase-8:c-FLIPL exhibits 
localized enzymatic activity and is preferentially an activator, promoting 
DED-mediated procaspase-8 oligomer assembly, whereas procaspase-8:c-FLIPS lacks 
activity and potently blocks procaspase-8 activation. This co-operative 
hierarchical binding model explains the dual role of c-FLIPL and crucially 
defines how c-FLIP isoforms differentially control cell fate.
