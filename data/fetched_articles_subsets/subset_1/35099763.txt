BACKGROUND: NPHS2 is the causative gene of nephrotic syndrome type 2 (MIM 
600995) which often clinically manifests as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome 
(SRNS). The NPHS2 gene encodes a slit diaphragm (SD) associated protein podocin.
OBJECTIVE: This study reported a novel disease-causing mutation of NPHS2 in a 
Chinese family with SRNS. We also investigated the pathogenic mechanism of the 
variants in this family.
METHOD: A Chinese family with SRNS was recruited. Whole exome sequencing was 
performed to screen for disease-causing mutation. Sanger sequencing was used to 
confirm the results. In vitro functional experiments including immunoblotting, 
co-immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescence staining were performed to 
explore the pathogenic mechanisms of mutations.
RESULTS: In this family, compound heterozygous mutations of NPHS2 (c.467dupT and 
c.865A > G) were identified and segregated with the disease. The maternal 
c.865A > G was a novel variant, leading to amino acid substitution (p.K289E). In 
vitro functional assays indicated that c.467dupT (p.L156FfsX11) mutant lost 
interaction with nephrin. Both K289E and L156FfsX11 mutants showed sharply 
diminished plasma membrane localization. Furthermore, abnormal distribution of 
podocin mutants also altered the cell membrane localization of nephrin.
CONCLUSION: We reported a family with SRNS caused by compound heterozygous 
mutations of NPHS2 (c.467dupT and c.865A > G). c.865A > G (p.K289E) in NPHS2 was 
a novel causative variant associated with SRNS. Both variants in this family not 
only affected the normal cell membrane localization of podocin, but also altered 
the cell membrane localization of nephrin which is the major architectural 
protein of SD.
