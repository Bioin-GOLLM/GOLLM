Two-component regulatory systems (TCRSs) mediate cellular response by coupling 
sensing and regulatory mechanisms. TCRSs are comprised of a histidine kinase 
(HK), which serves as a sensor, and a response regulator, which regulates 
expression of the effector gene after being phosphorylated by HK. Using these 
attributes, bacterial TCRSs can be engineered to design microbial systems for 
different applications. This review focuses on the current advances in 
TCRS-based biosensors and on the design of microbial systems for bioremediation 
and their potential application in biorefinery.
