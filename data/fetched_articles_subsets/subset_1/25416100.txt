BACKGROUND: Alterations in the redox balance are involved in the origin, 
promotion and progression of cancer. Inter-individual differences in the 
oxidative stress regulation can explain a part of the variability in cancer 
susceptibility.The aim of this study was to evaluate if polymorphisms in genes 
codifying for the different systems involved in oxidative stress levels can have 
a role in susceptibility to breast cancer.
METHODS: We have analyzed 76 single base polymorphisms located in 27 genes 
involved in oxidative stress regulation by SNPlex technology. First, we have 
tested all the selected SNPs in 493 breast cancer patients and 683 controls and 
we have replicated the significant results in a second independent set of 
samples (430 patients and 803 controls). Gene-gene interactions were performed 
by the multifactor dimensionality reduction approach.
RESULTS: Six polymorphisms rs1052133 (OGG1), rs406113 and rs974334 (GPX6), 
rs2284659 (SOD3), rs4135225 (TXN) and rs207454 (XDH) were significant in the 
global analysis. The gene-gene interactions demonstrated a significant 
four-variant interaction among rs406113 (GPX6), rs974334 (GPX6), rs105213 (OGG1) 
and rs2284659 (SOD3) (p-value = 0.0008) with high-risk genotype combination 
showing increased risk for breast cancer (OR = 1.75 [95% CI; 1.26-2.44]).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that different genotypes in 
genes of the oxidant/antioxidant pathway could affect the susceptibility to 
breast cancer. Furthermore, our study highlighted the importance of the analysis 
of the epistatic interactions to define with more accuracy the influence of 
genetic variants in susceptibility to breast cancer.
