Indole-3-acetamide (IAM) is the first confirmed auxin biosynthetic intermediate 
in some plant pathogenic bacteria. Exogenously applied IAM or production of IAM 
by overexpressing the bacterial iaaM gene in Arabidopsis causes auxin 
overproduction phenotypes. However, it is still inconclusive whether plants use 
IAM as a key precursor for auxin biosynthesis. Herein, we reported the isolation 
IAMHYDROLASE1 (IAMH1) gene in Arabidopsis from a forward genetic screen for 
IAM-insensitive mutants that display normal auxin sensitivities. IAMH1 has a 
close homolog named IAMH2 that is located right next to IAMH1 on chromosome IV 
in Arabidopsis. We generated iamh1 iamh2 double mutants using our CRISPR/Cas9 
gene editing technology. We showed that disruption of the IAMH genes rendered 
Arabidopsis plants resistant to IAM treatments and also suppressed the iaaM 
overexpression phenotypes, suggesting that IAMH1 and IAMH2 are the main enzymes 
responsible for converting IAM into indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in Arabidopsis. 
The iamh double mutants did not display obvious developmental defects, 
indicating that IAM does not play a major role in auxin biosynthesis under 
normal growth conditions. Our findings provide a solid foundation for clarifying 
the roles of IAM in auxin biosynthesis and plant development.
