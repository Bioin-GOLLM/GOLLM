We report the detection in TMC-1 of the protonated form of C3S. The discovery of 
the cation HC3S+ was carried through the observation of four harmonically 
related lines in the Q band using the Yebes 40m radiotelescope, and is supported 
by accurate ab initio calculations and laboratory measurements of its rotational 
spectrum. We derive a column density N(HC3S+) = (2.0 ± 0.5) × 1011 cm-2, which 
translates to an abundance ratio C3S/HC3S+ of 65 ± 20. This ratio is comparable 
to the CS/HCS+ ratio (35 ± 8) and is a factor of about ten larger than the 
C3O/HC3O+ ratio previously found in the same source. However, the abundance 
ratio HC3O+/HC3S+ is 1.0 ± 0.5, while C3O/C3S is just ~ 0.11. We also searched 
for protonated C2S in TMC-1, based on ab initio calculations of its 
spectroscopic parameters, and derive a 3σ upper limit of N(HC2S+)≤ 9×1011 cm-2 
and a C2S/HC2S+ ≥ 60. The observational results are compared with a 
state-of-the-art gas-phase chemical model and conclude that HC3S+ is mostly 
formed through several pathways: proton transfer to C3S, reaction of S+ with 
c-C3H2, and reaction between neutral atomic sulfur and the ion C3H+ 3.
