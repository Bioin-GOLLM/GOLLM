Mixed Cryptosporidium infections were detected in 7 of 21 patients with a 
diagnosis of rare Cryptosporidium canis or C. felis infections; 6 patients were 
infected with 2 Cryptosporidium spp. and 1 patient with 3 species. Mixed 
infections may occur more frequently than previously believed and should be 
considered when assessing cryptosporidiosis.
