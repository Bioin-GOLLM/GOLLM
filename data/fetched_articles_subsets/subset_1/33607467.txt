Skin fibroblasts obtained from a 28-year-old man with clinically manifested and 
genetically proven (F508del/W1282X) cystic fibrosis were successfully 
transformed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by using non-viral, 
non-integrating, self-replicating RNA reprogramming vectorthat contains five 
reprogramming factors: OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, GLIS1, and c-MYC as well as a 
puromycin-resistance gene. Two iPSC lines showed a normal karyotype, expressed 
pluripotency markers and exhibited the potential to differentiate into three 
germ layers in spontaneous differentiation assay. These iPSC lines may be 
subsequently used for development of a personalized etiotropic treatment,disease 
modelling, cell differentiation and organoid formation, pharmacological 
investigations and drug screening.
