Mutations in the Des gene coding for the muscle-specific intermediate filament 
protein desmin lead to myopathies and cardiomyopathies. We previously generated 
a R349P desmin knock-in mouse strain as a patient-mimicking model for the 
corresponding most frequent human desmin mutation R350P. Since nothing is known 
about the age-dependent changes in the biomechanics of affected muscles, we 
investigated the passive and active biomechanics of small fiber bundles from 
young (17-23 wks), adult (25-45 wks) and aged (>60 wks) heterozygous and 
homozygous R349P desmin knock-in mice in comparison to wild-type littermates. We 
used a novel automated biomechatronics platform, the MyoRobot, to perform 
coherent quantitative recordings of passive (resting length-tension curves, 
visco-elasticity) and active (caffeine-induced force transients, pCa-force, 
'slack-tests') parameters to determine age-dependent effects of the R349P desmin 
mutation in slow-twitch soleus and fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus small 
fiber bundles. We demonstrate that active force properties are not affected by 
this mutation while passive steady-state elasticity is vastly altered in R349P 
desmin fiber bundles compatible with a pre-aged phenotype exhibiting stiffer 
muscle preparations. Visco-elasticity on the other hand, was not altered. Our 
study represents the first systematic age-related characterization of small 
muscle fiber bundle preparation biomechanics in conjunction with inherited 
desminopathy.
