Thirty-two healthy volunteers with different SLCO1B1 genotypes ingested a 0.5-mg 
dose of repaglinide and 60-mg dose of nateglinide with a washout period of 1 
week. Participants with SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype (n = 4) had a 59% (P = 0.001) 
or 72% (P < 0.001) greater mean area under the plasma repaglinide 
concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) than participants with c.521TC (n = 
12) or c.521TT (n = 16) genotypes. The AUC(0-infinity) of repaglinide 
metabolites M2 and M4 were 112% (P = 0.004) and 81% (P = 0.002) larger in 
participants with c.521CC genotype than in those with c.521TT genotype, but no 
differences existed in the pharmacokinetics of M1. Maximum decrease in blood 
glucose concentration correlated with repaglinide AUC(0-infinity) (r = 0.412, P 
= 0.019). SLCO1B1 polymorphism had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics 
or pharmacodynamics of nateglinide or its M7 metabolite. Thus, in contrast to 
repaglinide, the disposition of nateglinide is unaffected by the SLCO1B1 
c.521T>C polymorphism.
