Environmental and genetic factors are associated with pandemic obesity since 
childhood. However, the association of overweight-obesity with these factors, 
acting as a consortium, has been scarcely studied in children. We aimed here to 
assess the probabilities of being overweighed-obese in a randomly recruited 
cohort of Spanish children and adolescents (n = 415, 5-17 years-old) by 
estimating the odds ratios for different predictor variables, and their relative 
importance in the prediction. The predictor variables were ethnicity, age, sex, 
adherence to the Mediterranean diet (KIDMED), physical activity, urolithin 
metabotypes (UM-A, UM-B and UM-0) as biomarkers of the gut microbiota, and 53 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 43 genes mainly related to obesity 
and cardiometabolic diseases. A proportional-odds logistic ordinal regression, 
validated through bootstrap, was used to model the data. While every variable 
was not independently associated with overweight-obesity, however, the ordinal 
logistic model revealed that overweight-obesity prevalence was related to being 
a young boy with either UM-B or UM-0, low KIDMED score and high contribution of 
a consortium of 24 SNPs, being rs1801253-ADRB1, rs4343-ACE, rs8061518-FTO, 
rs1130864-CRP, rs659366-UCP2, rs6131-SELP, rs12535708-LEP, rs1501299-ADIPOQ, 
rs708272-CETP and rs2241766-ADIPOQ the top-ten contributing SNPs. Additional 
research should confirm and complete this model by including dietary 
interventions and the individuals' gut microbiota composition.
