A case of congenital goiter with defective thyroglobulin synthesis has been 
studied in molecular terms. The patient is the fifth of a kindred of six, three 
of which have a goiter. The parents are first cousins. Segregation of 
thyroglobulin alleles in the family was studied by Southern blotting with a 
probe revealing a diallelic restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The 
results demonstrated that the three affected siblings were homozygous for the 
RFLP. Northern blotting analysis of the goiter RNA with a thyroglobulin probe 
suggested that thyroglobulin mRNA size was slightly reduced. Polymerase chain 
reaction amplification of the 8.5-kb thyroglobulin mRNA as overlapping cDNA 
fragments demonstrated that a 200-bp segment was missing from the 5' region of 
the goiter mRNA. Subcloning and sequencing of the cDNA fragments, and of the 
patient genomic DNA amplified from this region, revealed that exon 4 is missing 
from the major thyroglobulin transcript in the goiter, and that this aberrant 
splicing is due to a C to G transversion at position minus 3 in the acceptor 
splice site of intron 3. The presence in exon 4 of a putative donor tyrosine 
residue (Tyrosine nr 130) involved in thyroid hormone formation provides a 
coherent explanation to the hypothyroid status of the patient.
