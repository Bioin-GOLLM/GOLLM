Lysosomal cysteine peptidase cathepsin B (catB) is an important tumor-promoting 
factor involved in tumor progression and metastasis representing a relevant 
target for the development of new antitumor agents. In the present study, we 
synthesized 11 ruthenium compounds bearing either the clinical agent nitroxoline 
that was previously identified as potent selective reversible inhibitor of catB 
activity or its derivatives. We demonstrated that organoruthenation is a viable 
strategy for obtaining highly effective and specific inhibitors of catB endo- 
and exopeptidase activity, as shown using enzyme kinetics and microscale 
thermophoresis. Furthermore, we showed that the novel metallodrugs by catB 
inhibition significantly impair processes of tumor progression in in vitro cell 
based functional assays at low noncytotoxic concentrations. Generally, by using 
metallodrugs we observed an improvement in catB inhibition, a reduction of 
extracellular matrix degradation and tumor cell invasion in comparison to free 
ligands, and a correlation with the reactivity of the monodentate halide leaving 
ligand.
