Adenosine A2A receptor (A2A R) activation modulates several brain processes, 
ranging from neuronal maturation to synaptic plasticity. Most of these actions 
occur through the modulation of the actions of the neurotrophin brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In this work, we studied the role of A2A Rs in 
regulating postnatal and adult neurogenesis in the rat hippocampal dentate gyrus 
(DG). Here, we show that A2A R activation with CGS 21680 promoted neural stem 
cell self-renewal, protected committed neuronal cells from cell death and 
contributed to a higher density of immature and mature neuronal cells, 
particularly glutamatergic neurons. Moreover, A2A R endogenous activation was 
found to be essential for BDNF-mediated increase in cell proliferation and 
neuronal differentiation. Our findings contribute to further understand the role 
of adenosinergic signaling in the brain and may have an impact in the 
development of strategies for brain repair under pathological conditions.
