The PII proteins constitute one of the most widely distributed families of 
signal transduction proteins in nature. They are pivotal players in the control 
of nitrogen metabolism in bacteria and archaea, and are also found in the 
plastids of plants. Quite remarkably PII proteins control the activities of a 
diverse range of enzymes, transcription factors and membrane transport proteins, 
and in all known cases they achieve their regulatory effect by direct 
interaction with their target. PII proteins in the Proteobacteria and the 
Actinobacteria are subject to post-translational modification by uridylylation 
or adenylylation respectively, whilst in some Cyanobacteria they can be modified 
by phosphorylation. In all these cases the protein's modification state is 
influenced by the cellular nitrogen status and is thought to regulate its 
activity. However, in many organisms there is no evidence for modification of 
PII proteins and indeed the ability of these proteins to respond to the cellular 
nitrogen status is fundamentally independent of post-translational modification. 
In this review we explore the role of post-translational modification in PII 
proteins in the light of recent studies.
