Targeted inhibition of oncogenic pathways can be highly effective in halting the 
rapid growth of tumors but often leads to the emergence of slowly dividing 
persister cells, which constitute a reservoir for the selection of 
drug-resistant clones. In BRAFV600E melanomas, RAF and MEK inhibitors 
efficiently block oncogenic signaling, but persister cells emerge. Here, we show 
that persister cells escape drug-induced cell-cycle arrest via brief, sporadic 
ERK pulses generated by transmembrane receptors and growth factors operating in 
an autocrine/paracrine manner. Quantitative proteomics and computational 
modeling show that ERK pulsing is enabled by rewiring of mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling: from an oncogenic BRAFV600E monomer-driven 
configuration that is drug sensitive to a receptor-driven configuration that 
involves Ras-GTP and RAF dimers and is highly resistant to RAF and MEK 
inhibitors. Altogether, this work shows that pulsatile MAPK activation by 
factors in the microenvironment generates a persistent population of melanoma 
cells that rewires MAPK signaling to sustain non-genetic drug resistance.
