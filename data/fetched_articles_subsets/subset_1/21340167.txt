Type II 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ(5)-Δ(4)-isomerase (3β-HSD2), encoded 
by the HSD3B2 gene, is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of all the 
classes of steroid hormones. Deleterious mutations in the HSD3B2 gene cause the 
classical deficiency of 3β-HSD2, which is a rare autosomal recessive disease 
that leads to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is the most frequent 
cause of ambiguous genitalia and adrenal insufficiency in newborn infants with 
variable degrees of salt losing. Here we report the molecular and structural 
analysis of the HSD3B2 gene in a 46,XY child, who was born from consanguineous 
parents, and presented with ambiguous genitalia and salt losing. The patient 
carries a homozygous nucleotide c.665C>A change in exon 4 that putatively 
substitutes the proline at codon 222 for glutamine. Molecular homology modeling 
of normal and mutant 3β-HSD2 enzymes emphasizes codon 222 as an important 
residue for the folding pattern of the enzyme and validates a suitable model for 
analysis of new mutations.
