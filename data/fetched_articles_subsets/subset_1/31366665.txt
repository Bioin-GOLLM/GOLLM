The DNA replication machinery frequently encounters impediments that slow 
replication fork progression and threaten timely and error-free replication. The 
CHK1 protein kinase is essential to deal with replication stress (RS) and ensure 
genome integrity and cell survival, yet how basal levels and activity of CHK1 
are maintained under physiological, unstressed conditions is not well 
understood. Here, we reveal that CHK1 stability is controlled by its 
steady-state activity during unchallenged cell proliferation. This 
autoactivatory mechanism, which depends on ATR and its coactivator ETAA1 and is 
tightly associated with CHK1 autophosphorylation at S296, counters CHK1 
ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, thereby preventing attenuation of 
S-phase checkpoint functions and a compromised capacity to respond to RS. Based 
on these findings, we propose that steady-state CHK1 activity safeguards its 
stability to maintain intrinsic checkpoint functions and ensure genome integrity 
and cell survival.
