Two new members of the amphidinol family, amphidinol A (1) and its 7-sulfate 
derivative amphidinol B (2), were isolated from a strain of Amphidinium carterae 
of Lake Fusaro, near Naples (Italy), and chemically identified by spectroscopic 
and spectrometric methods. Amphidinol A showed antifungal activity against 
Candida albicans (MIC = 19 Âµg/mL). Biosynthetic experiments with stable 
isotope-labelled acetate allowed defining the elongation process in 1. For the 
first time the use of glycolate as a starter unit in the polyketide biosynthesis 
of amphidinol metabolites was unambiguously demonstrated.
