Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a rare, non-hereditary skeletal disorder characterized 
by its chronic course of non-neoplastic fibrous tissue buildup in place of 
healthy bone. A myriad of factors have been associated with its onset and 
progression. Perturbation of cell-cell signaling networks and response outputs 
leading to disrupted building blocks, incoherent multi-level organization, and 
loss of rigid structural motifs in mineralized tissues are factors that have 
been identified to participate in FD induction. In more recent years, novel 
insights into the unique biology of FD are transforming our understandings of 
its pathology, natural discourse of the disease, and treatment prospects. 
Herein, we built upon existing knowledge with recent findings to review 
clinical, etiologic, and histological features of FD and discussed known and 
potential mechanisms underlying FD manifestations. Subsequently, we ended on a 
note of optimism by highlighting emerging therapeutic approaches aimed at either 
halting or ameliorating disease progression.
