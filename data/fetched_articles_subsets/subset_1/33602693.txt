The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an urgent need to uncover the underlying 
biology of this devastating disease. Though RNA viruses mutate more rapidly than 
DNA viruses, there are a relatively small number of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) that differentiate the main SARS-CoV-2 lineages that have 
spread throughout the world. In this study, we investigated 129 RNA-seq data 
sets and 6928 consensus genomes to contrast the intra-host and inter-host 
diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses yielded three major observations. First, 
the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 highlights intra-host single nucleotide 
variant (iSNV) and SNP similarity, albeit with differences in C > U changes. 
Second, iSNV and SNP patterns in SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to MERS-CoV than 
SARS-CoV-1. Third, a significant fraction of insertions and deletions contribute 
to the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Altogether, our findings provide insight 
into SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, inform the design of detection tests, and 
highlight the potential of iSNVs for tracking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
