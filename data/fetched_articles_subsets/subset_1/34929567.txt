The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) is essential to the virus life cycle and is supposed to be a 
potential target for the treatment of coronaviral infection. Traditional Chinese 
medicines (TCMs) have played an impressive role in the treatment of COVID-19 in 
China. The effectiveness of TCM formulations prompts scientists to take 
continuous effort on searching for bioactive small molecules from the ancient 
resources. Herein, we developed a native mass spectrometry-based 
affinity-selection method for rapid screening of active small molecules from 
crude herbal extracts applied for COVID-19 therapy. Six common herbs named 
Lonicera japonica, Scutellaria baicalensis, Forsythia suspensa, Glycyrrhiza 
uralensis, Cirsium japonicum, and Andrographis paniculata were investigated. 
After preliminary separation of the crude extracts, the fractions were incubated 
with 3CLpro. A native MS-based affinity screening assay was then conducted to 
search for the protein-ligand complexes. A UHPLC-Q/TOF-MS with UNIFI data 
acquisition and data processing software was applied to identify the hit 
compounds. Standard compounds were used to verify the outcomes. Among the 16 
hits, three flavonoids, baicalein, scutellarein and ganhuangenin, were 
identified as potential noncovalent inhibitors against 3CLpro with IC50 values 
of 0.94, 3.02, and 0.84 μM, respectively. Their binding affinities were further 
characterized by native MS, with Kd values being 1.43, 3.85, and 1.09 μM, 
respectively. Overall, we established an efficient native MS-based strategy for 
discovering 3CLpro ligands from crude mixtures, which supplies a potential 
strategy of small molecule lead discovery from TCMs.
