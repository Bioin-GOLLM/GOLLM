Ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, is successfully used for the prevention 
and treatment of HIV infections. Ritonavir pharmacokinetics are complicated by 
inhibition, induction and pharmacogenetics of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes 
mediating its clearance. This investigation revealed that CYP2J2, along with 
CYP3A4/5 and CYP2D6, efficiently metabolizes ritonavir, and to a CYP2J2-specific 
(minor) metabolite. Chemical inhibition of ritonavir metabolism, clearance, 
KI/kinact and abundance of CYP2J2 in liver microsomes were evaluated and then 
applied to an in vitro-in vivo static scaling model to estimate the contribution 
of each isozyme, as a function of CYP abundance, activity, and genotype. 
Disposition of the CYP2J2-specific metabolite was also evaluated in vivo. In 
plasma, metabolite abundance was well above previously reported levels with 
circulating concentrations measured at 2 μM for the main hydroxylisopropyl 
metabolite. Ritonavir and metabolite plasma profiles were simulated using 
Simcyp(®). A modest (2-6%) contribution of CYP2J2 to ritonavir clearance is 
predicted which increases to more than 20% in subjects carrying CYP2D6 poor 
metabolizer polymorphisms and CYP3A4 irreversible inhibition. These results 
indicate that minor drug metabolizing enzymes could become quantitatively 
important in RTV clearance if main metabolic pathways are impeded.
