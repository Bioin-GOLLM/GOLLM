BACKGROUND: In bacteria, cell size affects chromosome replication, the assembly 
of division machinery, cell wall synthesis, membrane synthesis and ultimately 
growth rate. In addition, cell size can also be a target for Darwinian evolution 
for protection from predators. This strong coupling of cell size and growth, 
however, could lead to the introduction of growth defects after size evolution. 
An important question remains: can bacterial cell size change and/or evolve 
without imposing a growth burden?
RESULTS: The directed evolution of particular cell sizes, without a growth 
burden, was tested with a laboratory Escherichia coli strain. Cells of defined 
size ranges were collected by a cell sorter and were subsequently cultured. This 
selection-propagation cycle was repeated, and significant changes in cell size 
were detected within 400 generations. In addition, the width of the size 
distribution was altered. The changes in cell size were unaccompanied by a 
growth burden. Whole genome sequencing revealed that only a few mutations in 
genes related to membrane synthesis conferred the size evolution.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, bacterial cell size could evolve, through a few 
mutations, without growth reduction. The size evolution without growth reduction 
suggests a rapid evolutionary change to diverse cell sizes in bacterial survival 
strategies.
