Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder 
associated with dementia in late adulthood. Mitochondrial respiratory chain 
impairment has been detected in the brain, muscle, fibroblasts and platelets of 
AD patients, indicating a possible involvement of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in 
the etiology of the disease. Several reports have identified mtDNA mutations in 
AD patients, but there is no consensual opinion regarding the cause of the 
impairment. We have studied mtDNA NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 nucleotides 
3337-3340, searching for mutations. Our study group included 129 AD patients and 
125 healthy age-matched controls. We have found alterations in two AD patients: 
one had two already known mtDNA modifications (3197 T-C and 3338 T-C) and the 
other a novel transition (3199 T-C) which, to our knowledge, has not been 
described before.
