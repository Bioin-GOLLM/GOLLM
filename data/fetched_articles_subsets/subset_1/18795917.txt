BACKGROUND: Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked 
(IPEX) syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by neonatal autoimmune 
enteropathy, diabetes and thyroiditis, food allergies and skin rash. IPEX 
syndrome is caused by mutations in FOXP3, a master control gene of regulatory T 
cells (Tregs), resulting in absent or dysfunctional Tregs. Data in the 
literature are scarce and the cutaneous manifestations are rarely depicted.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency and characteristics of cutaneous 
manifestations found in IPEX.
METHODS: Retrospective single-centre study of a case series of IPEX. Patients' 
data were retrieved from medical files and numerous parameters concerning 
general and cutaneous characteristics of the disease were recorded.
RESULTS: Ten children with IPEX were studied. Cutaneous involvement was present 
in seven of 10 children; age at onset was 0-4 months, median 1.5. All patients 
presented with atopic dermatitis (AD). Three presented more psoriasiform 
lesions. Eczema was severe; most affected areas were lower limbs, trunk and 
face. Pruritus was present in four of seven, and painful fissurary cheilitis in 
four of seven. Hyper-IgE was found in seven of 10 and hypereosinophilia in five 
of 10. Skin biopsies showed eczematiform or psoriasiform features. Affected 
patients were improved by dermocorticoids; no clear improvement was obtained 
with immunosuppressive regimens. Other features were urticaria secondary to food 
allergies and staphylococcal sepsis, mostly Staphylococcus aureus and catheter 
related.
CONCLUSIONS: AD seems to be a frequent finding in IPEX syndrome, which is 
characterized by Treg anomalies. This hints to a possible role of Tregs in AD, 
which is then discussed in this study.
