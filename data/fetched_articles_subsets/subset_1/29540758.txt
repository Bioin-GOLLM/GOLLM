Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental biological process. Deficiency in 
MOSAIC DEATH 1 (MOD1), a plastid-localized enoyl-ACP reductase, leads to the 
accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and PCD, which can be suppressed 
by mitochondrial complex I mutations, indicating a signal from chloroplasts to 
mitochondria. However, this signal remains to be elucidated. In this study, 
through cloning and analyzing a series of mod1 suppressors, we reveal a 
comprehensive organelle communication pathway that regulates the generation of 
mitochondrial ROS and triggers PCD. We show that mutations in PLASTIDIAL 
NAD-DEPENDENT MALATE DEHYDROGENASE (plNAD-MDH), chloroplastic DICARBOXYLATE 
TRANSPORTER 1 (DiT1) and MITOCHONDRIAL MALATE DEHYDROGENASE 1 (mMDH1) can each 
rescue the ROS accumulation and PCD phenotypes in mod1, demonstrating a direct 
communication from chloroplasts to mitochondria via the malate shuttle. Further 
studies demonstrate that these elements play critical roles in the redox 
homeostasis and plant growth under different photoperiod conditions. Moreover, 
we reveal that the ROS level and PCD are significantly increased in 
malate-treated HeLa cells, which can be dramatically attenuated by knockdown of 
the human gene MDH2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis mMDH1. These results uncover a 
conserved malate-induced PCD pathway in plant and animal systems, 
revolutionizing our understanding of the communication between organelles.
