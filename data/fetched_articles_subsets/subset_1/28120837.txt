Several genome-wide association studies have been conducted to investigate the 
influence of genetic polymorphisms in the development of allergic diseases, but 
few of them have included the X chromosome. The aim of present study was to 
perform an X chromosome-wide association study (X-WAS) for asthma symptoms. The 
study included 1307 children of which 294 were asthma cases. DNA was genotyped 
using 2.5 HumanOmni Beadchip from Illumina. Statistical analyses were performed 
in PLINK 1.9, MACH 1.0 and Minimac2. The variant rs12007907 (g.29483892C>A) in 
IL1RAPL gene was suggestively associated with asthma symptoms in discovery set 
(odds ratio (OR)=0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37-0.67; P=3.33 × 10-6). 
This result was replicated in the ProAr cohort in men only (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 
0.21-0.95; P=0.038). Furthermore, investigating the functional role of the 
rs12007907 on the production a Th2-type cytokine, IL-13, we found a negative 
association between the minor allele A with IL-13 production in the discovery 
set (P=0.044). Gene-based analysis revealed that NUDT10 was the most 
consistently associated with asthma symptoms in discovery sample. In conclusion, 
the rs12007907 variant in IL1RAPL gene was negatively associated with asthma and 
IL-13 production in our study and a sex-specific association was observed in one 
of the validation samples. It suggests an effect on asthma susceptibility and 
may explain differences in severe asthma frequency between women and men.
