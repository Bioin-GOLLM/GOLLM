Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is a difficult-to-control bacterium since commercial 
vaccines do not prevent colonization and excretion. The present study aimed to 
evaluate the performance of an orally administered vaccine composed of antigens 
extracted from Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and incorporated into mesoporous silica 
(SBA-15), which has an adjuvant-carrier function, aiming to potentiate the 
action of the commercial intramuscular vaccine. A total of 60 piglets were 
divided into four groups (n = 15) submitted to different vaccination protocols 
as follows, Group 1: oral SBA15 + commercial vaccine at 24 days after weaning, 
G2: oral vaccine on the third day of life + vaccine commercial vaccine at 24 
days, G3: commercial vaccine at 24 days, and G4: commercial vaccine + oral 
vaccine at 24 days. On the first day, the piglets were weighed and, from the 
third day onwards, submitted to blood collections for the detection and 
quantification of anti-Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae IgG. Nasal swabs were collected 
to monitor IgA by ELISA, and oropharyngeal swabs were used to assess the 
bacterial load by qPCR. Biological samples were collected periodically from the 
third day of life until the 73rd day. At 41 days of life, 15 individuals of the 
same age, experimentally challenged with an inoculum containing M. 
hyopneumoniae, were co-housed with the animals from groups (1 to 4) in a single 
pen to increase the infection pressure during the nursery period. At 73 days, 
all piglets were euthanized, and lungs were evaluated by collecting samples for 
estimation of bacterial load by qPCR. Quantitative data obtained from physical 
parameters and laboratory investigation were analyzed by performing parametric 
or non-parametric statistical tests. Results indicate that animals from G2 
showed smaller affected lung areas compared to G3. Animals from G2 and G4 had a 
low prevalence of animals shedding M. hyopneumoniae at 61 days of age. 
Additionally, no correlation was observed between lung lesions and M. 
hyopneumoniae load in lung and BALF samples in animals that received the oral 
vaccine, while a strong correlation was observed in other groups. In the present 
study, evidence points to the effectiveness of the oral vaccine developed for 
controlling M. hyopneumoniae in pig production under field conditions.
