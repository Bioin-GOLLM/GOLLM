Viral capsid assembly and stability in tailed, dsDNA phage and Herpesviridae are 
achieved by various means including chemical crosslinks (unique to HK97), or 
auxiliary proteins (lambda, T4, phi29, and herpesviruses). All these viruses 
have coat proteins (CP) with a conserved, HK97-like core structure. We used a 
combination of trypsin digestion, gold labeling, cryo-electron microscopy, 3D 
image reconstruction, and comparative modeling to derive two independent, 
pseudoatomic models of bacteriophage P22 CP: before and after maturation. P22 
capsid stabilization results from intersubunit interactions among N-terminal 
helices and an extensive "P loop," which obviate the need for crosslinks or 
auxiliary proteins. P22 CP also has a telokin-like Ig domain that likely 
stabilizes the monomer fold so that assembly may proceed via individual subunit 
addition rather than via preformed capsomers as occurs in HK97. Hence, the P22 
CP structure may be a paradigm for understanding how monomers assemble in 
viruses like phi29 and HSV-1.
