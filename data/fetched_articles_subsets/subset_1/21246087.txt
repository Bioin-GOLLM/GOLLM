Pharmacological preconditioning with insulin and lithium ions prevented the 
death of renal cells under conditions of ischemia/reperfusion. Preincubation of 
cells with insulin or lithium ions decreased production of reactive oxygen 
species after ischemia/reoxygenation. These agents also prevented the 
development of mitochondrial dysfunction in renal cells induced by 
ischemia/reoxygenation. It was hypothesized that the protective effects of these 
agents are related to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3(. This enzyme is 
inactivated upon phosphorylation of serine residue in position 9. We found that 
in vivo administration of lithium ions to animals before renal ischemia prevents 
the development of kidney failure.
