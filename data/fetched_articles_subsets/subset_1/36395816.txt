With more and more data being collected, modern network representations exploit 
the complementary nature of different data sources as well as similarities 
across patients. We here introduce the Variation of information fused Layers of 
Networks algorithm (ViLoN), a novel network-based approach for the integration 
of multiple molecular profiles. As a key innovation, it directly incorporates 
prior functional knowledge (KEGG, GO). In the constructed network of patients, 
patients are represented by networks of pathways, comprising genes that are 
linked by common functions and joint regulation in the disease. Patient 
stratification remains a key challenge both in the clinic and for research on 
disease mechanisms and treatments. We thus validated ViLoN for patient 
stratification on multiple data type combinations (gene expression, methylation, 
copy number), showing substantial improvements and consistently competitive 
performance for all. Notably, the incorporation of prior functional knowledge 
was critical for good results in the smaller cohorts (rectum adenocarcinoma: 90, 
esophageal carcinoma: 180), where alternative methods failed.
