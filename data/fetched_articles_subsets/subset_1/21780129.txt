BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most 
frequent malignant neoplasms worldwide, and the second leading cause of death 
from cancer in Taiwan. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is an angiogenic chemokine with 
important roles in the development and progression of many human malignancies 
including HCC. This study investigates the effects of single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-8 gene on the susceptibility and 
clinicopathological characteristics of HCC.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-one HCC patients and 340 control subjects were 
analyzed for four IL-8 SNPs (-251 T/A, +781 C/T, +1633 C/T, and +2767 A/T) using 
PCR-RFLP genotyping analysis.
RESULTS: After adjusting for other confounders, results show that individuals 
with the IL-8 +781 T/T polymorphic genotype had a significantly lower risk of 
developing HCC than those with the wild-type (C/C) genotype (AOR = 0.346; 95% 
CI: 0.132-0.909). Multiple regression analysis showed that the presence of T/A 
or A/A at IL-8 -251 may indicate higher potential risk of hepatitis B infection 
(AOR = 2.847; 95% CI: 1.083-8.656). Additionally, these four IL-8 SNPs did not 
associate with liver-related clinicopathological markers in serum.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphism at IL-8 +781 is an important factor in 
determining susceptibility to HCC in the Taiwanese population.
