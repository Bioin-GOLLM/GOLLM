Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) is a severe disorder associated 
with epilepsy, developmental delay and intellectual disability, and in some 
cases premature mortality. We report the case of a female infant with EIEE and 
strikingly suppressed respiratory dysfunction that led to death. Postmortem 
research evaluation revealed hypoplasia of the arcuate nucleus of the medulla, a 
candidate region for respiratory regulation. Genetic evaluation revealed 
heterozygous variants in the related genes NRXN1 (c.2686C>T, p.Arg896Trp) and 
NRXN2 (c.3176G>A, p.Arg1059Gln), one inherited from the mother with family 
history of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and one from the father with 
family history of febrile seizures. Although there are no previous reports with 
the digenic combination of NRXN1 and NRXN2 variants, patients with biallelic 
loss of NRXN1 in humans and double neurexin 1α/2α knockout mice have severe 
breathing abnormalities, corresponding to the respiratory phenotype of our 
patient. These observations and the known interaction between the NRXN1 and 
NRXN2 proteins lead us to hypothesize that digenic variants in NRXN1 and NRXN2 
contributed to the phenotype of EIEE, arcuate nucleus hypoplasia, respiratory 
failure, and death.
