This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a quantitative 
electroencephalography (qEEG) biomarker in predicting the response to 
pharmacological treatment in patients with anxiety disorder. A total of 86 
patients were diagnosed with anxiety disorder according to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition, and subsequently treated 
with antidepressants. After 8-12 weeks, the participants were divided into 
treatment-resistant (TRS) and treatment-response (TRP) groups based on their 
Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scores. We obtained the 
absolute-EEG measurements for 19-channels and analyzed qEEG findings according 
to the frequency range: delta, theta, alpha, and beta. The beta-wave was 
subdivided into low-beta, beta, and high-beta waves. The theta-beta ratio (TBR) 
was calculated, and an analysis of covariance was performed. Of the 86 patients 
with anxiety disorder, 56 patients (65%) were classified in the TRS group. The 
TRS and TRP groups did not differ in terms of age, sex, or medication-dosage. 
However, the baseline CGI-S was higher in the TRP group. After calibration by 
covariates, the TRP group showed higher beta-waves in T3 and T4, and a lower 
TBR, especially in T3 and T4, than the TRS group. These results indicate that 
patients with a lower TBR and higher beta and high-beta waves in T3 and T4 are 
more likely to respond to medication.
