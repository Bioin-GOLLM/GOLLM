The outer segments (OS) of rod and cone photoreceptor cells are specialized 
sensory cilia that contain hundreds of opsin-loaded stacked membrane disks that 
enable phototransduction. The biogenesis of these disks is initiated at the OS 
base, but the driving force has been debated. Here, we studied the function of 
the protein encoded by the photoreceptor-specific gene C2orf71, which is mutated 
in inherited retinal dystrophy (RP54). We demonstrate that C2orf71/PCARE 
(photoreceptor cilium actin regulator) can interact with the Arp2/3 complex 
activator WASF3, and efficiently recruits it to the primary cilium. Ectopic 
coexpression of PCARE and WASF3 in ciliated cells results in the remarkable 
expansion of the ciliary tip. This process was disrupted by small interfering 
RNA (siRNA)-based down-regulation of an actin regulator, by pharmacological 
inhibition of actin polymerization, and by the expression of PCARE harboring a 
retinal dystrophy-associated missense mutation. Using human retinal organoids 
and mouse retina, we observed that a similar actin dynamics-driven process is 
operational at the base of the photoreceptor OS where the PCARE module and actin 
colocalize, but which is abrogated in Pcare-/- mice. The observation that 
several proteins involved in retinal ciliopathies are translocated to these 
expansions renders it a potential common denominator in the pathomechanisms of 
these hereditary disorders. Together, our work suggests that PCARE is an 
actin-associated protein that interacts with WASF3 to regulate the actin-driven 
expansion of the ciliary membrane at the initiation of new outer segment disk 
formation.
