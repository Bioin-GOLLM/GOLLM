The most prevalent form of cystic fibrosis arises from an amino acid deletion in 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, CFTR. A recently 
approved treatment for individuals homozygous for this mutation combines a 
chemical corrector, which helps CFTR fold, and a potentiator that increases CFTR 
channel activity.
