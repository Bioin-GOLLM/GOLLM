Neuromedin U receptor 2 (NMU2), an emerging attractive target for treating 
obesity, has shown the capability in reducing food intake and regulating energy 
metabolism when activated. However, drug development of NMU2 was deferred 
partially due to the lack of structural information. Here, we present the 
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of NMU2 bound to the endogenous 
agonist NmU-25 and Gi1 at 3.3 Å resolution. Combined with functional and 
computational data, the structure reveals the key factors that govern the 
recognition and selectivity of peptide agonist as well as non-peptide 
antagonist, providing the structural basis for design of novel and highly 
selective drugs targeting NMU2. In addition, a 25-degree rotation of Gi protein 
in reference to NMU2 is also observed compared in other structures of class A 
GPCR-Gi complexes, suggesting heterogeneity in the processes of G 
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activation and G protein coupling.
