Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are chronic demyelinating 
diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Recently, variants of vitamin D 
metabolizing genes, including rs12368653, rs10876994, rs118204009 and rs703842 
in CYP27B1, and rs2248359 in CYP24A1 have been identified to be associated with 
the pathogenicity of MS in Caucasian populations. However, these results have 
not been replicated in Han Chinese population. Here we investigated the 
association of these variants with MS and NMO susceptibility in 149 MS patients, 
110 NMO patients and 294 healthy controls using MassARRAY system and Sanger 
sequencing. We found that the frequencies of the A allele of rs703842 were 
higher in MS patients than controls (p=0.032), and statistical differences were 
observed in the genotypes of both rs703842 (p=0.013) and rs10876994 (p=0.001) 
between NMO patients and controls. In addition, we found difference in the 
genotype of rs12368653 between MS patients and controls (p=0.008). However, no 
difference was found in rs2248359 among these three groups. The reported rare 
mutation p.R389H (rs118204009) was not found in our study. In conclusion, our 
study suggested that variants of CYP27B1 were associated with both MS and NMO 
patients in Han Chinese population.
