Hearing loss (HL) is the most common congenital sensory impairment. Usher 
syndrome (USH) is the leading genetic etiology of congenital deafness combined 
with progressive vision loss, and individuals presenting with these symptoms are 
often assumed to have USH. This can be an erroneous assumption, as there are 
additional genetic causes of deaf-blindness. Our objective is to describe and 
accurately diagnose non-USH genetic causes of deaf-blindness. We present three 
children with hearing and vision loss with clinical and genetic findings 
suggestive of USH. However, ongoing clinical assessment did not completely 
support an USH diagnosis, and exome analysis was pursued for all three 
individuals. Updated genetic testing showed pathogenic variants in ALMS1 in the 
first individual and TUBB4B in the second and third. Although HL in all three 
was consistent with USH type 2, vision impairment with retinal changes was noted 
by age 2 yr, which is unusual for USH. In all three the updated genotype more 
accurately fit the clinical phenotype. Because USH is the most common form of 
genetic deaf-blindness, individuals with HL, early vision impairment, and 
retinal dysfunction are often assumed to have USH. However, additional genes 
associated with HL and retinal impairment include ALMS1, TUBB4B, CEP78, ABHD12, 
and PRPS1 Accurate genetic diagnosis is critical to these individuals' 
understanding of their genetic conditions, prognosis, vision and hearing loss 
management, and future access to molecular therapies. If clinically or 
genetically USH seems uncertain, updated genetic testing for non-USH genes is 
essential.
