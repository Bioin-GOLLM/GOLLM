BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and the leading 
cause of death for women worldwide, and the problem is currently getting worse. 
In Ethiopia, it has become one of the most prevalent cancers, with high rates of 
morbidity and mortality. The BRCA2 gene variant c.5946delT has been linked to a 
higher risk of developing breast cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to detect the presence of the 
c.5946delT pathogenic variant in the BRCA2 gene and associated risk factors 
among breast cancer patients visiting FHRH and UoGCSH.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2021 to October 
2022. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 100 patients with breast 
cancer, and gDNA was extracted using the salting-out method as per the protocol 
provided in the manufacturer's instructions. The BRCA2 gene c.5946delT variant 
was detected using the PCR-RFLP technique. The data were analyzed using SPSS 
version 23. P≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: In this study, we discovered that 2% of breast cancer patients had a 
c.5946delT pathogenic variant of the BRCA2 gene. In addition, the results 
suggested that the c.5946delT pathogenic variant and age at diagnosis were 
significantly correlated. On the other hand, there was no significant 
association between inhabitance and family history for the c.5946delT variant.
CONCLUSION: We have found out that breast cancer patients in the study area had 
the BRCA2 gene variant c.5946delT, which suggests that this pathogenic variant 
is linked to breast cancer. Hence, assessing gene alterations using the PCR 
technique is one of the most effective early diagnostic strategies for breast 
cancer that should be used in hospitals in order to lower mortality.
