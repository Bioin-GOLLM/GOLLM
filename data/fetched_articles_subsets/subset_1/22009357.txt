The use of mutant mouse models of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative 
disease is essential in order to understand the pathogenesis of many genetic 
diseases such as fragile X syndrome and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
syndrome (FXTAS). The choice of which animal model is most suitable to mimic a 
particular disease depends on a range of factors, including anatomical, 
physiological, and pathological similarities; presence of orthologs of genes of 
interest; and conservation of basic cell biological and metabolic processes. In 
this chapter, we will discuss two mouse models of the fragile X premutation 
which have been generated to study the pathogenesis of FXTAS and the effects of 
potential therapeutic interventions. Behavioral, molecular, neuropathological, 
and endocrine features of the mouse models and their relation to human FXTAS are 
discussed.
