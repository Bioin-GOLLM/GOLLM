BACKGROUND: Genomic analysis has upended chordate phylogeny, placing the 
tunicates as the sister group to the vertebrates. This taxonomic rearrangement 
raises questions about the emergence of a tunicate/vertebrate ancestor.
RESULTS: Characterization of developmental genes uniquely shared by tunicates 
and vertebrates is one promising approach for deciphering developmental shifts 
underlying acquisition of novel, ancestral traits. The matrix glycoprotein 
Fibronectin (FN) has long been considered a vertebrate-specific gene, playing a 
major instructive role in vertebrate embryonic development. However, the recent 
computational prediction of an orthologous "vertebrate-like" Fn gene in the 
genome of a tunicate, Ciona savignyi, challenges this viewpoint suggesting that 
Fn may have arisen in the shared tunicate/vertebrate ancestor. Here we verify 
the presence of a tunicate Fn ortholog. Transgenic reporter analysis was used to 
characterize a Ciona Fn enhancer driving expression in the notochord. Targeted 
knockdown in the notochord lineage indicates that FN is required for proper 
convergent extension.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that acquisition of Fn was associated with 
altered notochord morphogenesis in the vertebrate/tunicate ancestor.
