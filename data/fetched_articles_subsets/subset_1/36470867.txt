Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), enactment of dreams 
during REM sleep, is an early clinical symptom of alpha-synucleinopathies and 
defines a more severe subtype. The genetic background of RBD and its underlying 
mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we perform a genome-wide association 
study of RBD, identifying five RBD risk loci near SNCA, GBA, TMEM175, INPP5F, 
and SCARB2. Expression analyses highlight SNCA-AS1 and potentially SCARB2 
differential expression in different brain regions in RBD, with SNCA-AS1 further 
supported by colocalization analyses. Polygenic risk score, pathway analysis, 
and genetic correlations provide further insights into RBD genetics, 
highlighting RBD as a unique alpha-synucleinopathy subpopulation that will allow 
future early intervention.
