INTRODUCTION: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive 
condition related to abnormal inflammatory responses. As an inflammatory driver, 
nucleotide-binding oligomerizing domain-1 (NOD1) is highly expressed in 
pulmonary inflammatory cells; however, the roles of NOD1 in COPD are unknown.
METHODS: A COPD mouse model was established by lipopolysaccharides tracheal 
instillation plus cigarette smoke (CS) exposure. NOD1 activation was induced by 
C12-iE-DAP (iE) treatment in both control and COPD mice. Inflammatory 
infiltration, pulmonary histological damage and gene expression were measured to 
evaluate the lung function of treated mice.
RESULTS: The results showed that NOD1 was up-regulated in COPD mice, which 
significantly exaggerated CS-induced impairment of lung function, demonstrated 
by increased airway resistance, functional residual capacity and pulmonary 
damages. Mechanistically, NOD1 activation strongly activated the TLR4/NF-κB 
signaling pathway and then increased inflammatory responses and promoted the 
secretion of inflammatory cytokines.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that NOD1 is an important risk factor in the 
progression of COPD; therefore, targeting NOD1 in lung tissues is a potential 
strategy for COPD treatment.
