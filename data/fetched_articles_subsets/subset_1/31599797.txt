PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To recap the expanding clinical spectrum, genotype-phenotype 
associations and treatment options in the light of recently published articles 
regarding the deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2).
RECENT FINDINGS: Whole-exome sequencing enabled novel clinical phenotypes 
associated with ADA2 mutations. Since its discovery, the phenotypic spectrum of 
DADA2 has substantially expanded to cover Diamond-Blackfan anaemia, cytopenia 
and immunodeficiency syndromes. In addition to elevated TNF alpha levels, 
increased levels of interferon-stimulated genes were also detected in patients 
with DADA2. Given the absence of clinical trials until now, no standard 
treatment strategy exists for DADA2. Currently, anti-TNF alpha agents are the 
mainstay of treatment, based on the data both from the initial two reports and 
from subsequent studies. However, it is still unclear how to manage asymptomatic 
patients with ADA2 mutation and/or with absent ADA2 activity and what is the 
optimal duration of anti-TNF therapy.
SUMMARY: Among a total of 206 DADA2 patients described so far, the overall 
mortality was found as 8.3%. Biallelic homozygous G47R mutations were mostly 
associated with a vascular phenotype, whereas patients with homozygous R169Q 
mutations seem to display a mixed clinical phenotype including vascular, 
haematological and immunological manifestations. HSCT should be reserved as a 
curative treatment option for DADA2 patients unresponsive to the anti-TNF 
therapy, as it carries a significant morbidity.
