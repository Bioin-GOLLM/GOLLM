Cancer metabolic reprogramming is essential for maintaining cancer cell survival 
and rapid replication. A common target of this metabolic reprogramming is 
one-carbon metabolism which is notable for its function in DNA synthesis, 
protein and DNA methylation, and antioxidant production. Polyamines are a key 
output of one-carbon metabolism with widespread effects on gene expression and 
signaling. As a result of these functions, one-carbon and polyamine metabolism 
have recently drawn a lot of interest for their part in cancer malignancy. 
Therapeutic inhibitors that target one-carbon and polyamine metabolism have thus 
been trialed as anticancer medications. The significance and future 
possibilities of one-carbon and polyamine metabolism as a target in cancer 
therapy are discussed in this review.
