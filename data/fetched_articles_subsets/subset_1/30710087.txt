The 22q11.2 deletion is a strong, but insufficient, "first hit" genetic risk 
factor for schizophrenia (SZ). We attempted to identify "second hits" from the 
entire genome in a unique multiplex 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS) family. 
Bioinformatic analysis of whole-exome sequencing and comparative-genomic 
hybridization array identified de novo and inherited, rare and damaging 
variants, including copy number variations, outside the 22q11.2 region. A 
specific 22q11.2-haplotype was associated with psychosis. The interaction of the 
identified "second hits" with the 22q11.2 haploinsufficiency may affect 
neurodevelopmental processes, including neuron projection, cytoskeleton 
activity, and histone modification in 22q11.2DS-ralated psychosis. A larger load 
of variants, involved in neurodevelopment, in combination with additional 
molecular events that affect sensory perception, olfactory transduction and 
G-protein-coupled receptor signaling may account for the development of 
22q11.2DS-related SZ. Comprehensive analysis of multiplex families is a 
promising approach to the elucidation of the molecular pathophysiology of 
22q11.2DS-related SZ with potential relevance to treatment.
