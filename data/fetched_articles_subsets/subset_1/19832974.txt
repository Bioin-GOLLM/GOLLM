BACKGROUND: The beta2-adrenergic receptor (BAR2) is the main lipolytic receptor 
in white human adipose tissue. There is a functional glutamine 27 glutamic acid 
(Gln27Glu, rs 1042714) polymorphism in its gene, which has been variably 
associated with body mass index. This gene variant may be associated with 
male-type adiposity in women and thus increased cardiovascular risk. We 
investigated whether the BAR2 Gln27Glu polymorphism is associated with visceral 
fat and coronary intima thickness in women.
METHODS: The amount of mesenteric and omental fat was directly measured and 
anthropometric measurements were done from 112 forensic autopsy cases of women 
aged 15 to 49 years. The thickness of the coronary intima, which reflects the 
severity of atherosclerosis, was measured by computerized image analysis. The 
BAR2 Gln27Glu polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: We found that the amount of visceral fat was significantly higher in 
women with the Glu allele (689 +/- 555 g) compared to Gln/Gln homozygotes (481 
+/- 392 g, P = 0.023). The waist-hip ratio also tended to be higher in women 
with the Glu allele compared to Gln/Gln homozygotes (p = 0.050). There were no 
statistically significant differences between the genotype groups in BMI or the 
thickness of coronary intima.
CONCLUSION: The Glu allele of the BAR2 gene may be a risk factor for visceral 
fat accumulation in young to middle-aged women. However, this polymorphism was 
not associated with preclinical atherosclerosis.
