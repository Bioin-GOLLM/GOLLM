The lysis protein A2 , present as a single copy on the surface of Qβ virion 
particles, was previously shown to inhibit the activity of MurA, an enzyme that 
catalyses the first committed step of murein biosynthesis. Here we report 
experiments with a two-hybrid study that indicates A2 and MurA interact 
directly. Moreover, experiments with a soluble MBP-A2 fusion indicate that the 
interaction between MurA and A2 is dependent on a substrate-induced 
conformational change featured in the UDP-NAG-liganded state of MurA but not the 
tetrahedral intermediate state. Moreover, based on the location of L138Q, the 
original dominant A2 -resistant mutant that identified MurA as the target, a 
directed mutagenesis strategy has identified a continuous surface required for 
A2 binding. This surface spans the catalytic loop/cleft and encompasses both the 
catalytic and C-terminal domains. These data support a model in which A2 
preferentially binds MurA liganded with UDP-NAG, thereby preventing catalysis by 
occluding PEP from accessing the active site.
