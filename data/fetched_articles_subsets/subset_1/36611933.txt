Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignancy of the thyroid 
gland and early stages are curable. However, a subset of PTCs shows an unusually 
aggressive phenotype with extensive lymph node metastasis and higher incidence 
of locoregional recurrence. In this study, we investigated a large cohort of PTC 
cases with an unusual aggressive phenotype using a high-throughput RNA 
sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify differentially regulated genes associated with 
metastatic PTC. All metastatic PTC with mutated BRAF (V600E) but not BRAF 
wild-type expressed an up-regulation of R-Spondin Protein 4 (RSPO4) concomitant 
with an upregulation of genes involved in focal adhesion and cell-extracellular 
matrix signaling. Further immunohistochemistry validation confirmed the 
upregulation of these target genes in metastatic PTC cases. Preclinical studies 
using established PTC cell lines support that RSPO4 overexpression is associated 
with BRAF V600E mutation and is a critical upstream event that promote 
activation of kinases of focal adhesion signaling known to drive cancer cell 
locomotion and invasion. This finding opens up the potential of co-targeting 
B-Raf, RSPO and focal adhesion proteins as a pharmacological approach for 
aggressive BRAF V600E PTC.
