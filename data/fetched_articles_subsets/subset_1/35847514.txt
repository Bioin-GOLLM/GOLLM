Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is a significant human pathogen, especially in 
children. EV-A71 infection is one of the leading causes of hand, foot, and mouth 
diseases (HFMD), and can lead to neurological complications such as acute 
flaccid myelitis (AFM) in severe cases. Although three EV-A71 vaccines are 
available in China, they are not broadly protective and have reduced efficacy 
against emerging strains. There is currently no approved antiviral for EV-A71. 
Significant progress has been made in developing antivirals against EV-A71 by 
targeting both viral proteins and host factors. However, viral capsid inhibitors 
and protease inhibitors failed in clinical trials of human rhinovirus infection 
due to limited efficacy or side effects. This review discusses major discoveries 
in EV-A71 antiviral development, analyzes the advantages and limitations of each 
drug target, and highlights the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to 
advance the field forward.
