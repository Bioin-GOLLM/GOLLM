Granulosa cell tumor (GST) is a sex-cord/stromal neoplasm of the gonads, more 
commonly arising in the ovaries, while approximately 80 cases have been reported 
in the testes. Out of these, 30 cases were of the adult type, while the 
remainder 50 cases were of the juvenile type. The latter mostly concerned 
infants and followed a benign course. However, the adult type testicular GCTs 
may be potentially malignant as it also happens in female patients with such 
neoplasms. We present a case of an adult type GCT located at the left testis. 
The patient was subjected to total orchiectomy and received no further 
treatment. Histology showed typical GCT histomorphology with Call-Exner bodies 
in some places. The immunoprofile of the tumor was CD99 (+), calretinin (+), 
inhibin (+), alpha smooth muscle actin (+), vimentin (+), ER (-), PR (-), 
keratin AE1/AE3 (-), alpha fetoprotein (-), CD117 (-), and placental alkaline 
phosphatase (-). Two years after surgery, the patient is alive and well with no 
signs of recurrence.
