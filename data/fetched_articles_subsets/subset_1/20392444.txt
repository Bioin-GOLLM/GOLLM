OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the influence of apolipoprotein A5 gene 
(APOA5)-1131T>C single nucleotide polymorphism on the effects of dietary 
intervention and regular exercise (DIRE) targeting ApoA5 and triglyceride (TG) 
concentrations.
METHODS: Hypertriglyceridemia patients (TG, 150-500mg/dL, n=283) undertook a 
12-week DIRE (replacing 1/3 of refined rice in their diets with legumes, 
increasing vegetable intake, and regular walking).
RESULTS: Pre-treatment, no genotype-related differences were detected in ApoA5, 
TG, or HDL cholesterol levels; however, post-treatment, subjects homozygous 
(T/T) for the T allele had lower serum TG (P=0.009) and higher HDL cholesterol 
(P=0.036) than other subjects. In T/T subjects, after adjustments for age, sex 
and weight changes (r1) or initial TG levels (r2), changes in ApoA5 levels 
negatively correlated with TG changes (r1=-0.29, P=0.05, r2=-0.28, P<0.1) and 
positively correlated with changes in HDL cholesterol (r1=0.30, P<0.05, r2=0.32, 
P<0.05) and free fatty acid (r1=0.38, P<0.01, r2=0.40, P<0.01). In those with 
moderate hypertriglyceridemia (TG, 200-500mg/dL, n=130), APOA5-1131T/T carriers 
achieved significantly lower TG (P=0.007) and higher HDL cholesterol (P<0.001) 
than -1131C allele carriers. Additionally, statistically significant 
interactions between the -1131T>C and the compliance of DIRE were found for the 
change in TG (P=0.002) and HDL cholesterol (P=0.039). In good compliance group, 
T/T subjects showed greater reduction of TG and higher increase of HDL 
cholesterol than other subjects. On the other hand, non-good compliance group 
had no significant improvement in these variables.
CONCLUSIONS: APOA5-1131T/T carriers may benefit more from the DIRE than C allele 
carriers. These effects were remarkable in patients with moderate 
hypertriglyceridemia and the individuals with good compliance.
