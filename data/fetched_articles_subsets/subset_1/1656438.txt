Retinal degeneration in the mouse mutant, rd, was previously shown to be a 
disorder of cyclic nucleotide metabolism involving a deficiency in the activity 
of the rod photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). We have characterized the 
normal and rd PDE beta-subunit gene, and their respective transcripts, by PCR 
and direct sequence analysis. We show that the gene consists of at least 22 
exons ranging in size from 48 base pairs to several hundred base pairs, covering 
greater than 25 kilobases. Within a 67-base-pair exon of the rd PDE beta-subunit 
gene, we identified a nonsense ochre mutation (a C----A transversion in codon 
347) that truncates the normal gene product, eliminating more than one-half of 
the peptide chain, including the putative catalytic domain. The consequences of 
the truncation are consistent with the observed phenotypes in rd mice 
heterozygous and homozygous for the disorder. The nonsense mutation was also 
found in another related and in six unrelated strains displaying the rd 
phenotype, indicating that the rd allele arose from a single genetic event. The 
results strongly argue for the nonsense mutation being responsible for retinal 
degeneration in the rd mouse.
