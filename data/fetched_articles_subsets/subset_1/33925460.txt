BACKGROUND: Survival rates for highly invasive bladder cancer (BC) patients have 
been very low, with a 5-year survival rate of 6%. Accurate prediction of tumor 
progression and survival is important for diagnosis and therapeutic decisions 
for BC patients. Our study aims to develop an autophagy-related-gene (ARG) 
signature that helps to predict the survival of BC patients.
METHODS: RNA-seq data of 403 BC patients were retrieved from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma (TCGA-BLCA) database. Univariate Cox 
regression analysis was performed to identify overall survival (OS)-related 
ARGs. The Lasso Cox regression model was applied to establish an ARG signature 
in the TCGA training cohort (N = 203). The performance of the 11-gene ARG 
signature was further evaluated in a training cohort and an independent 
validation cohort (N = 200) using Kaplan-Meier OS curve analysis, receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, as well as univariate and multivariate 
Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Our study identified an 11-gene ARG signature that is significantly 
associated with OS, including APOL1, ATG4B, BAG1, CASP3, DRAM1, ITGA3, KLHL24, 
P4HB, PRKCD, ULK2, and WDR45. The ARGs-derived high-risk bladder cancer patients 
exhibited significantly poor OS in both training and validation cohorts. The 
prognostic model showed good predictive efficacy, with the area under the ROC 
curve (AUCs) for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival of 0.702 (0.695), 
0.744 (0.640), and 0.794 (0.658) in the training and validation cohorts, 
respectively. A prognostic nomogram, which included the ARGs-derived risk 
factor, age and stage for eventual clinical translation, was established.
CONCLUSION: We identified a novel ARG signature for risk-stratification and 
robust prediction of overall survival for BC patients.
