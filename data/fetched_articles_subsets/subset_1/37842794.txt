INTRODUCTION: Factor X deficiency is a rare inherited bleeding disorder. To 
date, 181 variants are reported in the recently updated F10-gene variant 
database.
AIM: This study aimed to describe new F10 variants.
METHOD: The F10 gene was analysed in 16 consecutive families with FX deficiency 
by a targeted high-throughput sequencing approach, including F10, F9, F8 genes, 
and 78 genes dedicated to haematological malignancies.
RESULTS: We identified 19 variants (17 missense, one nonsense and one 
frameshift) and two copy number variations. Two patients presenting a combined 
FVII-FX deficiency showed a loss of one F10 gene copy (del13q34) associated with 
a missense variant on the remaining allele, leading to a FX:C significantly 
lower than the FVII:C level and explaining their unusual bleeding history. We 
reported five novel variants. Three missense variants (p.Glu22Val affecting the 
signal peptide cleavage site, p.Cys342Tyr removing the disulphide bond between 
the FX heavy and light chains, and p.Val385Met located in FX peptidase S1 
domain) were detected at compound heterozygosis status in three patients with 
severe bleeding symptoms and FX:C level below 10 IU/dL. Two truncating variants 
p.Tyr279* and p.Thr434Aspfs*13 leading to an altered FX protein were found at 
heterozygous state in two patients with mild bleeding history.
CONCLUSION: This study showed the feasibility and the interest of 
high-throughput sequencing approach for rare bleeding disorders, enabling the 
report of F10 gene screening in a 3-weeks delay, suitable for clinical use. The 
description of five new variants may contribute to a better understanding of the 
phenotype-genotype correlation in FX deficiency.
