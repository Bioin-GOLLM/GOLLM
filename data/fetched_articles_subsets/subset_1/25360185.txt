INTRODUCTION: Despite the medical progress in treatment. Tuberculosis (TB) 
continues to be a serious global health problem. A genome-wide linkage study 
identified a major susceptibility locus on chromosomal region 8q12-q13 in 
Moroccan TB patients. The CYP7A1 gene is located in this region and codes for 
cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol catabolism.
METHODS: We selected three SNPs (rs3808607, rs8192875 and rs8192879) and studied 
their genotype and allele frequencies distribution in patients with pulmonary 
(PTB) or pleural TB (pTB), and compared them to Healthy Controls (HC). 
Genotyping of rs8192875 and rs8192879 SNPs was carried out using the Taq Man SNP 
genotyping Assay while rs3808607 was investigated by PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: We reported here for the first time a statistically significant 
increase in the AA homozygote genotype frequency of rs3808607 in PTB patients 
compared to HC (p=0.02, OR=1.93, 95% CI: 1.93 (1.07;3.49). The increased risk of 
developing TB was maintained when we combined the groups of patients (PTB-pTB) 
(p=0.01, OR=1.91, 95% CI=(1.07-3.42). In contrast, no genetic association was 
observed between the rs8192875 or rs8192879 polymorphisms and TB.
CONCLUSION: Our investigations suggest that rs3808607 may play a role in 
susceptibility to TB in a Moroccan population.
