Cerebral palsy is a major neonatal handicap with unknown aetiology. There is 
evidence that prenatal brain injury is the leading cause of CP. Severe placental 
pathology accounts for a high percentage of cases. Several factors predispose to 
prenatal brain damage but when and how they act is unclear. The aim of this 
paper was to determine if hypoxia during pregnancy leads to damage in fetal 
brain and to evaluate the localization of this injury. An animal model of 
chronic hypoxia produced by chronic administration of a nitric oxide synthase 
inhibitor (L-NAME) was used to evaluate apoptotic activity in fetal brains and 
to localize the most sensitive areas. L-NAME reproduces a preeclamptic-like 
condition with increased blood pressure, proteinuria, growth restriction and 
intrauterine mortality. Apoptotic activity was increased in L-NAME brains and 
the most sensitive areas were the subventricular and pallidum zone. These 
results may explain the clinical features of CP. Further studies are needed.
