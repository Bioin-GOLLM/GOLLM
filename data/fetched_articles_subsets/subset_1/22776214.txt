Live attenuated viruses make potent and effective vaccines. Despite the urgent 
need for an HIV vaccine, this approach has not been feasible, since it has not 
been possible to attenuate the virus reliably and guarantee vaccine safety. 
Instead, live viral vectors have been proposed that could present HIV vaccine 
antigens in the most immunogenic way, in the context of an active infection. We 
have adapted the rubella vaccine strain RA27/3 as a vector to express HIV and 
SIV antigens, and tested the effect of insert size and composition on vector 
stability and viral titer. We have identified an acceptor site in the rubella 
nonstructural gene region, where foreign genes can be expressed as a fusion 
protein with the nonstructural protein P150 without affecting essential viral 
functions. The inserts were expressed as early genes of rubella, under control 
of the rubella genomic promoter. At this site, HIV and SIV antigens were 
expressed stably for at least seven passages, as the rubella vectors reached 
high titers. Rubella readily infects rhesus macaques, and these animals will 
provide an ideal model for testing the new vectors for replication in vivo, 
immunogenicity, and protection against SIV or SHIV challenge.
