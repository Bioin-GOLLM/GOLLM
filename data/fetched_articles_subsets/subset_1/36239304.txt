The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic arbovirus considered a global threat to 
public health. Although there have been several efforts in drug discovery 
projects for ZIKV in recent years, there are still no antiviral drugs approved 
to date. Here, we describe the results of a global collaborative crowdsourced 
open science project, the OpenZika project, from IBM's World Community Grid 
(WCG), which integrates different computational and experimental strategies for 
advancing a drug candidate for ZIKV. Initially, molecular docking protocols were 
developed to identify potential inhibitors of ZIKV NS5 RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase (NS5 RdRp), NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro), and NS3 helicase (NS3hel). 
Then, a machine learning (ML) model was built to distinguish active vs inactive 
compounds for the cytoprotective effect against ZIKV infection. We performed 
three independent target-based virtual screening campaigns (NS5 RdRp, 
NS2B-NS3pro, and NS3hel), followed by predictions by the ML model and other 
filters, and prioritized a total of 61 compounds for further testing in 
enzymatic and phenotypic assays. This yielded five non-nucleoside compounds 
which showed inhibitory activity against ZIKV NS5 RdRp in enzymatic assays (IC50 
range from 0.61 to 17 μM). Two compounds thermally destabilized NS3hel and 
showed binding affinity in the micromolar range (Kd range from 9 to 35 μM). 
Moreover, the compounds LabMol-301 inhibited both NS5 RdRp and NS2B-NS3pro (IC50 
of 0.8 and 7.4 μM, respectively) and LabMol-212 thermally destabilized the ZIKV 
NS3hel (Kd of 35 μM). Both also protected cells from death induced by ZIKV 
infection in in vitro cell-based assays. However, while eight compounds 
(including LabMol-301 and LabMol-212) showed a cytoprotective effect and 
prevented ZIKV-induced cell death, agreeing with our ML model for prediction of 
this cytoprotective effect, no compound showed a direct antiviral effect against 
ZIKV. Thus, the new scaffolds discovered here are promising hits for future 
structural optimization and for advancing the discovery of further drug 
candidates for ZIKV. Furthermore, this work has demonstrated the importance of 
the integration of computational and experimental approaches, as well as the 
potential of large-scale collaborative networks to advance drug discovery 
projects for neglected diseases and emerging viruses, despite the lack of 
available direct antiviral activity and cytoprotective effect data, that 
reflects on the assertiveness of the computational predictions. The importance 
of these efforts rests with the need to be prepared for future viral epidemic 
and pandemic outbreaks.
