Intellectual disability (ID), occurring in syndromic or non-syndromic forms, is 
the most common neurodevelopmental disorder. Although many cases are caused by 
single gene defects, ID is highly genetically heterogeneous. Biallelic variants 
in the transmembrane protein TMEM147 have recently been linked to intellectual 
disability with dysmorphic facial features. TMEM147 is believed to localize to 
the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and nuclear envelope and also involved in 
biogenesis of multi-pass membrane proteins. Here, we report two patients born to 
a consanguineous family with a novel loss-of-function variant; 
(NM_001242597.2:c.193-197del) in TMEM147 causing intellectual disability and 
spasticity. Whole exome sequencing and validating Sanger sequencing were 
utilized to confirm the identified causal variant. Our findings were in line 
with the previously described patients with TMEM147 variants manifesting 
intellectual disability as a major clinical sign but also featured spasticity as 
a phenotypic expansion. This study provides additional evidence for the 
pathogenicity of TMEM147 mutations in intellectual disability and expands the 
phenotypic and variant spectrum linked to this gene.
