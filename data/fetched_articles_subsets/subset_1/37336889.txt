The COVID-19 response strategies in Chinese mainland were recently adjusted due 
to the reduced pathogenicity and enhanced infectivity of Omicron subvariants. In 
Chengdu, China, an infection wave was predominantly induced by the BA.5 
subvariant. It is crucial to determine whether the hybrid anti-SARS-CoV-2 
immunity following BA.5 infection, coupled with a variety of immune background, 
is sufficient to shape the immune responses against newly emerged Omicron 
subvariants, especially for XBB lineages. To investigate this, we collected 
serum and nasal swab samples from 108 participants who had been infected in this 
BA.5 infection wave, and evaluated the neutralization against pseudoviruses. Our 
results showed that convalescent sera from individuals, regardless of 
vaccination history, had remarkably compromised neutralization capacities 
against the newly emerged XBB and XBB.1.5 subvariants. Although post-vaccination 
with BA.5 breakthrough infection slightly elevated plasma neutralizing 
antibodies against a part of pseudoviruses, the neutralization activities were 
remarkably impaired by XBB lineages. Furthermore, we analyzed the impacts of the 
number of vaccinations, age, and sex on the humoral and cellular immune response 
after BA.5 infection. Our findings suggest that the neutralization against XBB 
lineages that elicited by current hybrid immunity after BA.5 infection, are 
remained at low levels, indicating an urgent need for the development of 
next-generation of COVID-19 vaccines that designed based on the XBB sub-lineages 
and other future variants.
