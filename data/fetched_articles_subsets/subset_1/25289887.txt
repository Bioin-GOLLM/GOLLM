Dinaciclib is a potent CDK1, 2, 5 and 9 inhibitor being developed for the 
treatment of cancer. Additional understanding of antitumor mechanisms and 
identification of predictive biomarkers are important for its clinical 
development. Here we demonstrate that while dinaciclib can effectively block 
cell cycle progression, in vitro and in vivo studies, coupled with mouse and 
human pharmacokinetics, support a model whereby induction of apoptosis is a main 
mechanism of dinaciclib's antitumor effect and relevant to the clinical duration 
of exposure. This was further underscored by kinetics of dinaciclib-induced 
downregulation of the antiapoptotic BCL2 family member MCL1 and correlation of 
sensitivity with the MCL1-to-BCL-xL mRNA ratio or MCL1 amplification in solid 
tumor models in vitro and in vivo. This MCL1-dependent apoptotic mechanism was 
additionally supported by synergy with the BCL2, BCL-xL and BCL-w inhibitor 
navitoclax (ABT-263). These results provide the rationale for investigating MCL1 
and BCL-xL as predictive biomarkers for dinaciclib antitumor response and 
testing combinations with BCL2 family member inhibitors.
