The etiology of imperforate anus, a major phenotype of anorectal malformation 
(ARM), is still unknown and not a single gene has been reported to be associated 
with it. We studied a Korean family with six affected members with imperforate 
anus across three generations by whole exome sequencing and identified a 
missense mutation in the EBF2 gene (c.215C > T; p.Ala72Val). This mutation is 
completely segregated with the disease phenotype in the family and is 
evolutionarily highly conserved among diverse vertebrates. Also, this mutation 
was predicted to be functionally damaging. These results support that missense 
mutation in the EBF2 c.215C > T (p.Ala72Val) is very likely to contribute to the 
pathogenesis of ARM in this family.
