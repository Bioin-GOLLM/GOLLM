BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Achieving HBsAg loss is an important landmark in the 
natural history of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A more personalized approach to 
prediction of HBsAg loss is relevant in counseling patients. This study sought 
to develop and validate a prediction model for HBsAg loss based on quantitative 
HBsAg levels (qHBsAg) and other baseline characteristics.
METHODS: The Hepatitis B Research Network (HBRN) is a prospective cohort 
including 1240 untreated HBeAg-negative patients (1150 adults, 90 children) with 
median follow-up of 5.5 years. Incidence rates of HBsAg loss and hepatitis B 
surface antibody (anti-HBs) acquisition were determined, and a predictor score 
of HBsAg loss using readily available variables was developed and externally 
validated.
RESULTS: Crude incidence rates of HBsAg loss and anti-HBs acquisition were 1.6 
and 1.1 per 100 person-years (PY); 67 achieved sustained HBsAg loss for an 
incidence rate of 1.2 per 100 PY. Increased HBsAg loss was significantly 
associated with older age, non-Asian race, HBV phenotype (inactive CHB vs. 
others), HBV genotype A, lower HBV-DNA levels, and lower and greater change in 
qHBsAg. The HBRN-SQuARe (sex,∆quantHBsAg, age, race) score predicted HBsAg loss 
over time with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 
(95% CIs) at 1 and 3 years of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.987-1.00) and 0.95 (95% CI 
0.91-1.00), respectively. In validation in another cohort of 1253 HBeAg-negative 
patients with median follow-up of 3.1 years, HBRN SQuARe predicted HBsAg loss at 
1 and 3 years with AUROC values of 0.99 (0.98-1.00) and 0.88 (0.77-0.99), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: HBsAg loss in predominantly untreated patients with HBeAg-negative 
CHB can be accurately predicted over a 3-year horizon using a simple validated 
score (HBRN SQuARe). This prognostication tool can be used to support patient 
care and counseling.
