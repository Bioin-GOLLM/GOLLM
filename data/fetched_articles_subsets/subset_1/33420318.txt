The RNA integrity number (RIN) is a frequently used quality metric to assess the 
completeness of rRNA, as a proxy for the corresponding mRNA in a tissue. Current 
methods operate at bulk resolution and provide a single average estimate for the 
whole sample. Spatial transcriptomics technologies have emerged and shown their 
value by placing gene expression into a tissue context, resulting in 
transcriptional information from all tissue regions. Thus, the ability to 
estimate RNA quality in situ has become of utmost importance to overcome the 
limitation with a bulk rRNA measurement. Here we show a new tool, the spatial 
RNA integrity number (sRIN) assay, to assess the rRNA completeness in a tissue 
wide manner at cellular resolution. We demonstrate the use of sRIN to identify 
spatial variation in tissue quality prior to more comprehensive spatial 
transcriptomics workflows.
