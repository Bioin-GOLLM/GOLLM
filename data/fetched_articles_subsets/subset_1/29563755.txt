AIM: To establish a rat model for evaluating the maturity of liver regeneration 
derived from associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged 
hepatectomy (ALPPS).
METHODS: In the present study, ALPPS, partial hepatecotmy (PHx), and sham rat 
models were established initially, which were validated by significant increase 
of proliferative markers including Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, 
and cyclin D1. In the setting of accelerated proliferation in volume at the 
second and fifth day after ALPPS, the characteristics of newborn hepatocytes, as 
well as specific markers of progenitor hepatic cell, were identified. 
Afterwards, the detection of liver function followed by cluster analysis of 
functional gene expression were performed to evaluate the maturity.
RESULTS: Compared with PHx and sham groups, the proliferation of FLR was 
significantly higher in ALPPS group (P = 0.023 and 0.001 at second day, P = 
0.034 and P < 0.001 at fifth day after stage I). Meanwhile, the increased 
expression of proliferative markers including Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear 
antigen, and cyclin D1 verified the accelerated liver regeneration derived from 
ALPPS procedure. However, ALPPS-induced Sox9 positive hepatocytes significantly 
increased beyond the portal triad, which indicated the progenitor hepatic cell 
was potentially involved. And the characteristics of ALPPS-induced hepatocytes 
indicated the lower expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 and anti-tryptase 
in early proliferative stage. Both suggested the immaturity of ALPPS-derived 
liver regeneration. Additionally, the detection of liver function and functional 
genes expression confirmed the immaturity of renascent hepatocytes derived in 
early stage of ALPPS-derived liver regeneration.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the immaturity of ALPPS-derived proliferation in 
early regenerative response, which indicated that the volumetric assessment 
overestimated the functional proliferation. This could be convincing evidence 
that the stage II of ALPPS should be performed prudently in patients with 
marginally adequate FLR, as the ALPPS-derived proliferation in volume lags 
behind the functional regeneration.
