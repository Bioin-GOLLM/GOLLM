Alternative splicing is a post-transcriptional regulatory process that is 
attaining stronger recognition as a modulator of gene expression. Alternative 
splicing occurs when the primary RNA transcript is differentially processed into 
more than one mature RNAs. This is the result of a variable definition/inclusion 
of the exons, the sequences that are excised from the primary RNA to form the 
mature RNAs. Consequently, RNA expression can generate a collection of 
differentially spliced RNAs, which may distinctly influence subsequent 
biological events, such as protein synthesis or other biomolecular interactions. 
Still the mechanisms that control exon definition and exon inclusion are not 
fully clarified. This mini-review highlights advances in this field as well as 
the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in affecting splicing decisions. 
The Glioma-associated oncogene 1, GLI1, is taken as an example in addressing the 
role of nucleotide substitutions for splicing regulation.
