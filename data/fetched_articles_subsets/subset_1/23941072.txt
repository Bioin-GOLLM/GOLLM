AIM: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is one of the most common hip 
deformities in children. Since the COL1A1 gene is located in the DDH relating 
region, we investigated the COL1A1 promoter variations in the development of 
DDH.
RESULTS: We collected 154 unrelated female patients and 180 matched healthy 
female children, and then sequenced the COL1A1 gene promoter for detection of 
variations. Three variations in the COL1A1 gene promoter were detected in ten 
patients (T-139C, C-106T, and C-35T [rs113647555]), but none of the 180 health 
controls. The chi-square test showed that the rate of total variations in COL1A1 
gene contributed to DDH (p=0.0016).
CONCLUSION: We detected three variations in the COL1A1 gene promoter in patients 
and first demonstrated that the higher rate of total variations of COL1A1 gene 
contributed to DDH in Chinese female children; thus, the COL1A1 gene is a new 
candidate gene for DDH disease.
