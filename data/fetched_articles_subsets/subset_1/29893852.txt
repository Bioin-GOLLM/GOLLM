SEC23B is a component of coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles that transport 
secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. 
Loss-of-function SEC23B mutations cause a rare form of anemia, resulting from 
decreased SEC23B levels. We recently identified germline heterozygous SEC23B 
variants as potentially cancer-predisposing. Mutant SEC23B associated with ER 
stress-mediated tumorigenesis, without decreased SEC23B expression. However, our 
understanding of the processes behind these observations remain limited. Here, 
we show mutant SEC23B exists within nucleoli, in addition to classical 
distribution at the ER/Golgi. This occurs independent of other COPII proteins 
and does not compromise secretory function. Mutant cells have increased 
ribosomal protein and translation-related gene expression, and enhanced 
translational capacity, in the presence of ER stress. We show that mutant SEC23B 
binds to UBF transcription factor, with increased UBF transcription factor 
binding at the ribosomal DNA promoter. Our data indicate SEC23B has potential 
non-canonical COPII-independent function, particularly within the ribosome 
biogenesis pathway, and that may contribute to the pathogenesis of 
cancer-predisposition.
