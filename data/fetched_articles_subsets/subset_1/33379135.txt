BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate clinical and 
pathological characteristics of the tall cell variant of papillary thyroid 
carcinoma compared to conventional variants.
METHODS: The clinical records of patients who underwent surgical treatment 
between 2009 and 2015 were analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups: 
those with a histopathological diagnosis of tall cell papillary carcinoma were 
included in Group A, and those with a diagnosis of conventional variants in 
Group B.
RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were included in Group A and 316 in Group B. All 
patients underwent total thyroidectomy. Central compartment and lateral cervical 
lymph node dissection were performed more frequently in Group A (42.8% vs. 18%, 
p = 0.001, and 17.1% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.04). Angiolymphatic invasion, parenchymal 
invasion, extrathyroidal extension, and lymph node metastases were more frequent 
in Group A, and the data reached statistical significance. Local recurrence was 
more frequent in Group A (17.1% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.02), with two patients (5.7%) in 
Group A showing visceral metastases, whereas no patient in Group B developed 
metastatic cancer (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Tall cell papillary carcinoma is the most frequent aggressive 
variant of papillary thyroid cancer. Tall cell histology represents an 
independent poor prognostic factor compared to conventional variants.
