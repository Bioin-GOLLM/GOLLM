OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: SLITRK family proteins control neurite outgrowth and 
regulate synaptic development. In mice, Slitrk6 plays a role in the survival and 
innervation of sensory neurons in the inner ear, vestibular apparatus, and 
retina, and also influences axial eye length. We provide the first detailed 
description of the auditory phenotype in humans with recessive SLITRK6 
deficiency.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational case study.
METHODS: Nine closely related Amish subjects from an endogamous Amish community 
of Pennsylvania underwent audiologic and vestibular testing. Single nucleotide 
polymorphism microarrays were used to map the chromosome locus, and Sanger 
sequencing or high-resolution melt analysis were used to confirm the allelic 
variant.
RESULTS: All nine subjects were homozygous for a novel nonsense variant of 
SLITRK6 (c.1240C>T, p.Gln414Ter). Adult patients had high myopia. The 4 oldest 
SLITRK6 c.1240C>T homozygotes had absent ipsilateral middle ear muscle reflexes 
(MEMRs). Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were absent in all 
ears tested and the cochlear microphonic (CM) was increased in amplitude and 
duration in young patients and absent in the two oldest subjects. Auditory 
brainstem responses (ABRs) were dys-synchronised bilaterally with no 
reproducible waves I, III, or V at high intensities. Hearing loss and speech 
reception thresholds deteriorated symmetrically with age, which resulted in 
severe-to-profound hearing impairment by early adulthood. Vestibular evoked 
myogenic potentials were normal in three ears and absent in one.
CONCLUSION: Homozygous SLITRK6 c.1240C>T (p.Gln414Ter) nonsense mutations are 
associated with high myopia, cochlear dysfunction attributed to outer hair cell 
disease, and progressive auditory neuropathy.
