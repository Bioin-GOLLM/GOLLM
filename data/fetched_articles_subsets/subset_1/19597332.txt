The Akt (PKB) protein kinases are critical regulators of human physiology that 
control an impressive array of diverse cellular functions, including the 
modulation of growth, survival, proliferation and metabolism. The Akt kinase 
family is comprised of three highly homologous isoforms: Akt1 (PKBalpha), Akt2 
(PKBbeta) and Akt3 (PKBgamma). Phenotypic analyses of Akt isoform knockout mice 
documented Akt isoform specific functions in the regulation of cellular growth, 
glucose homeostasis and neuronal development. Those studies establish that the 
functions of the different Akt kinases are not completely overlapping and that 
isoform-specific signaling contributes to the diversity of Akt activities. 
However, despite these important advances, a thorough understanding about the 
specific roles of Akt family members and the molecular mechanisms that determine 
Akt isoform functional specificity will be essential to elucidate the complexity 
of Akt regulated cellular processes and how Akt isoform-specific deregulation 
might contribute to disease states. Here, we summarize recent advances in 
understanding the roles of Akt isoforms in the regulation of metabolism and 
cancer, and possible mechanisms contributing to Akt isoform functional 
specificity.
