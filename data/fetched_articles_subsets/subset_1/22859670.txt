Spatial and temporal organization of signal transduction is coordinated through 
the segregation of signaling enzymes in selected cellular compartments. This 
highly evolved regulatory mechanism ensures the activation of selected enzymes 
only in the vicinity of their target proteins. In this context, cAMP-responsive 
triggering of protein kinase A is modulated by a family of scaffold proteins 
referred to as A-kinase anchoring proteins. A-kinase anchoring proteins form the 
core of multiprotein complexes and enable simultaneous but segregated cAMP 
signaling events to occur in defined cellular compartments. In this review we 
will focus on the description of A-kinase anchoring protein function in the 
regulation of cardiac physiopathology.
