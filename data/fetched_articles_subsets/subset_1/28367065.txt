OBJECTIVE: No definitive chemotherapeutic regimen has been established in 
patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who failed second- or 
third-line treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate apatinib, a VEGFR-2 
inhibitor, in advanced NSCLC as salvage treatment.
METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of apatinib in patients with 
previously treated advanced NSCLC from 2014 to 2015 in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. 
Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients were included in the present study. Four patients 
achieved partial response, and 22 achieved stable disease, representing a 
response rate of 9.5% and a disease control rate of 61.9%. Median 
progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.2 and 6.0 months, 
respectively. The toxicities associated with apatinib were generally acceptable 
with a total grade 3/4 toxicity of 50%.
CONCLUSION: Apatinib appears to have some activity against advanced NSCLC when 
utilized as salvage treatment.
