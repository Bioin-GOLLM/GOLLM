OBJECTIVE: Ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV LED) irradiation at 280 nm has 
been confirmed to induce apoptosis in cultured HL-60 cells, but the underlying 
mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 280 nm 
UV LED irradiation on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial 
membrane potential (MMP) in HL-60 cells.
METHODS: HL-60 cells were irradiated with 0, 8, 15, or 30 J/m2 of 280 nm UV LED 
and incubated for 2 hours. The intracellular ROS levels were assessed using the 
fluorescent probe 2'-7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and a 
fluorescence plate reader. MMP was determined by flow cytometry using 
5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide 
(JC-1) staining. The apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl-2 were evaluated by 
western blot.
RESULTS: UV LED irradiation at 280 nm induced a dose-dependent increase in ROS 
production and loss of MMP, and it activated apoptosis at irradiation doses of 8 
to 30 J/m2. These results were consistent with a previous apoptosis study from 
the authors' group.
CONCLUSION: Enhanced ROS production and mitochondrial depolarization are two 
distinct but interacting events, and both are involved in UV LED-induced 
apoptosis in HL-60 cells.
