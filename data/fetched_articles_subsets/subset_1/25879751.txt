Determining immune protection-inducing protein structures (IMPIPS) involves 
defining the stereo-electron and topochemical characteristics which are 
essential in MHC-p-TCR complex formation. Modified high activity binding 
peptides (mHABP) were thus synthesised to produce a large panel of IMPIPS 
measuring 26.5 ±3.5Å between the farthest atoms fitting into Pockets 1 to 9 of 
HLA-DRβ1* structures. They displayed a polyproline II-like (PPIIL) structure 
with their backbone O and N atoms orientated to establish H-bonds with specific 
residues from HLA-DRβ1*-peptide binding regions (PBR). Residues having specific 
charge and gauche+ orientation regarding p3χ1, p5χ2, and p7χ1 angles determined 
appropriate rotamer orientation for perfectly fitting into the TCR to induce an 
appropriate immune response. Immunological assays in Aotus monkeys involving 
IMPIPS mixtures led to promising results; taken together with the aforementioned 
physicochemical principles, non-interfering, long-lasting, protection-inducing, 
multi-epitope, multistage, minimal subunit-based chemically-synthesised peptides 
can be designed against diseases scourging humankind.
