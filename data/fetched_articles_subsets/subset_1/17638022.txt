Juvenile cystinosis was diagnosed in a patient who presented with severe 
headache attacks and photophobia. Treatment with oral cysteamine and topical 
cysteamine eye drops was started. One-and-a-half years later, he developed 
unilateral gynecomastia and elevated prolactin and growth hormone levels. A 
pituitary macroprolactinoma was discovered and successfully treated with the 
dopamine agonist cabergoline. Increased serum growth hormone levels were 
attributed to enhanced growth hormone production by the prolactinoma and 
somatostatin inhibition by cysteamine. Although the occurrence of prolactinoma 
in this patient could be a simple coincidence, it might also be a rare yet 
unrecognised complication of cystinosis.
