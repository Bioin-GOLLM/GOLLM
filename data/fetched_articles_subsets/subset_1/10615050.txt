Expression of Q205L Galphao (Galphao*), an alpha subunit of heterotrimeric 
guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) that lacks guanosine 
triphosphatase (GTPase) activity in NIH-3T3 cells, results in transformation. 
Expression of Galphao* in NIH-3T3 cells activated signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) but not mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 
kinases 1 or 2. Coexpression of dominant negative Stat3 inhibited 
Galphao*-induced transformation of NIH-3T3 cells and activation of endogenous 
Stat3. Furthermore, Galphao* expression increased activity of the tyrosine 
kinase c-Src, and the Galphao*-induced activation of Stat3 was blocked by 
expression of Csk (carboxyl-terminal Src kinase), which inactivates c-Src. The 
results indicate that Stat3 can function as a downstream effector for Galphao* 
and mediate its biological effects.
