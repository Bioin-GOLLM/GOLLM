The electrical discharge drilling (EDD) process is an effective machining 
approach to produce various holes in difficult-to-cut materials. However, the 
energy efficiency of the EDD operation has not thoroughly been considered in 
published works. The aim of the current work is to optimize varied parameters 
for enhancing the material removal rate (MRR), saving drilled energy (ED), and 
decreasing the expansion of the hole (HE) for the EDD process. Three advanced 
factors, including the gap voltage adjustor (GAP), capacitance parallel 
connection (CAP), and servo sensitivity selection (SV), are considered. The 
predictive models of the performances were proposed with the support of the 
adaptive neuro-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). An integrative approach 
combining the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the neighborhood cultivation 
genetic algorithm (NCGA) was employed to select optimal factors. The findings 
revealed the optimal values of the CAP, GAP, and SV were 6, 5, and 4, 
respectively. Moreover, the ED and HE were decreased by 16.78% and 28.68%, while 
the MRR was enhanced by 89.72%, respectively, as compared to the common setting 
values. The explored outcome can be employed as a technical solution to enhance 
the energy efficiency, drilled quality, and productivity of the EDD operation.
