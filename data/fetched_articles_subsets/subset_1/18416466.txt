AIM: To analyze the metallochaperone antioxidant-1 (Atox1) gene sequence in 
Wilson disease patients.
METHODS: Mutation analysis of the four exons of the Atox1 gene including the 
intron- exon boundaries was performed in 63 Wilson disease patients by direct 
sequencing.
RESULTS: From 63 selected patients no mutations were identified after the entire 
coding region including the intron- exon boundaries of Atox1 were sequenced. One 
known polymorphism within the Atox1 gene (5'UTR -99 T>C) in 31 (49%) of the 
Wilson patients as well as one previously undescribed variation (5'UTR -68 C>T) 
in 2 of the Wilson patients could be detected. Statistical analyses revealed 
that the existence of a variation within the Atox1- gene showed a tendency 
towards an earlier onset of the disease.
CONCLUSION: Based on the data of this study, no major role can be attributed to 
Atox1 in the pathophysiology or clinical variation of Wilson disease.
