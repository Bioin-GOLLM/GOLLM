Primary hyperammonemic encephalopathy due to urea cycle disorders (UCD) 
typically manifests with episodic unresponsiveness and this clinical entity is 
not often included in the differential diagnosis of presumed non-convulsive 
status epilepticus (NCSE). However, this diagnostic consideration has 
therapeutic implications. In this report, we document the therapeutic importance 
of elucidating the specific cause of hyperammonemic encephalopathy that closely 
mimicked NCSE through 2 unique illustrative cases.
