Stigma characteristics are important factors affecting the seed yield of hybrid 
rice per unit area. Natural variation of stigma characteristics has been 
reported in rice, but the genetic basis for this variation is largely unknown. 
We performed a genome-wide association study on three stigma characteristics in 
six environments using 1.3 million single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) 
characterized in 353 diverse accessions of Oryza sativa. An abundance of 
phenotypic variation was present in the three stigma characteristics of these 
collections. We identified four significant SNPs associated with stigma length, 
20 SNPs with style length (SYL), and 17 SNPs with the sum of stigma and style 
length, which were detected repeatedly in more than four environments. Of these 
SNPs, 28 were novel. We identified two causal gene loci for SYL, OsSYL3 and 
OsSYL2; OsSYL3 was co-localized with the grain size gene GS3. The SYL of 
accessions carrying allele OsSYL3AA was significantly longer than that of those 
carrying allele OsSYL3CC . We also demonstrated that the outcrossing rate of 
female parents carrying allele OsSYL2AA increased by 5.71% compared with that of 
the isogenic line carrying allele OsSYL2CC in an F1 hybrid seed production 
field. The allele frequencies of OsSYL3AA and OsSYL2AA decreased gradually with 
an increase in latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results should 
facilitate the improvement in stigma characteristics of parents of hybrid rice.
