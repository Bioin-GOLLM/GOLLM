Identifying a suitable course of immunotherapy treatment for a given patient as 
well as monitoring treatment response is heavily reliant on biomarkers detected 
and quantified in blood and tissue biospecimens. Suboptimal or variable 
biospecimen collection, processing, and storage practices have the potential to 
alter clinically relevant biomarkers, including those used in cancer 
immunotherapy. In the present review, we summarize effects reported for 
immunologically relevant biomarkers and highlight preanalytical factors 
associated with specific analytical platforms and assays used to predict and 
gauge immunotherapy response. Given that many of the effects introduced by 
preanalytical variability are gene-, transcript-, and protein-specific, 
biospecimen practices should be standardized and validated for each biomarker 
and assay to ensure accurate results and facilitate clinical implementation of 
newly identified immunotherapy approaches.
