Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism by 
activating PTH type I receptor (PTH1R). Here we show that transforming growth 
factor (TGF)-beta type II receptor (TbetaRII) forms an endocytic complex with 
PTH1R in response to PTH and regulates signalling by PTH and TGF-beta. TbetaRII 
directly phosphorylates the PTH1R cytoplasmic domain, which modulates 
PTH-induced endocytosis of the PTH1R-TbetaRII complex. Deletion of TbetaRII in 
osteoblasts increases the cell-surface expression of PTH1R and augments PTH 
signalling. Conditional knockout of TbetaRII in osteoblasts in mice results in a 
high bone mass with increased trabecular bone and decreased cortical bone, 
similar to the bone phenotype in mice expressing a constitutively active PTH1R. 
Disruption of PTH signalling by injection of PTH(7-34) or ablation of PTH1R 
rescues the bone phenotype of TbetaRII knockout mice. These studies reveal a 
previously unrecognized function for TbetaRII and a mechanism for integration of 
PTH and local growth factor at the membrane receptor level.
