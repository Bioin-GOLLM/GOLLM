Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is considered a priority pathogen and a major threat 
to global health. While CHIKV infections may be asymptomatic, symptomatic 
patients can develop chikungunya fever (CHIKF) characterized by severe 
arthralgia which often transitions into incapacitating arthritis that could last 
for years and lead to significant loss in health-related quality of life. Yet, 
Chikungunya fever (CHIKF) remains a neglected tropical disease due to its 
complex epidemiology and the misrepresentation of its incidence and disease 
burden worldwide. Transmitted to humans by infected Aedes mosquitoes, CHIKV has 
dramatically expanded its geographic distribution to over 100 countries, causing 
large-scale outbreaks around the world and putting more than half of the 
population of the world at risk of infection. More than 50 years have passed 
since the first CHIKV vaccine was reported to be in development. Despite this, 
there is no licensed vaccine or antiviral treatments against CHIKV to date. In 
this review, we highlight the clinical relevance of developing chikungunya 
vaccines by discussing the poor understanding of long-term disease burden in 
CHIKV endemic countries, the complexity of CHIKV epidemiological surveillance, 
and emphasising the impact of the global emergence of CHIKV infections. 
Additionally, our review focuses on the recent progress of chikungunya vaccines 
in development, providing insight into the most advanced vaccine candidates in 
the pipeline and the potential implications of their roll-out.
