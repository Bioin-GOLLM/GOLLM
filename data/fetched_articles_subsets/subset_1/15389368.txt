CASE REPORT: A fifty-five year old man complained of diminished visual acuity in 
his right eye and reported a deep venous thrombosis in his right leg five years 
ago. Examination showed a central retinal vein occlusion in the right eye. 
Mutations in the factor V gene and prothrombin gene were found in a 
thrombophilia study. The patient was anticoagulated and no laser 
photocoagulation was required.
DISCUSSION: Various coagulation disorders induced by genetic mutations are often 
associated with an increased risk for retinal vein occlusion although there are 
no statistically significant associations reported in the literature.
