We investigated the associations between hearing aids (HA) and the maintenance 
of cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults with moderate 
hearing loss. A total of 407 participants aged 60 years or older with moderate 
hearing loss were recruited from the National Institute for Longevity Sciences, 
Longitudinal Study for Aging (NILS-LSA). Moderate hearing loss was defined as a 
pure-tone average of 40-69 dB at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz of the better ear, 
according to the definition proposed by the Japan Audiological Society. 
Cognitive function was evaluated using the four subtests of the Japanese version 
of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Short Forms (WAIS-R-SF): 
Information, Similarities, Picture completion, and Digit Symbol Substitution 
(DSST). A longitudinal analysis of 1192 observations with a mean follow-up 
period of 4.5 ± 3.9 years was performed. The HA use rate at any time during the 
follow-up period was 31.4%, and HA users were significantly younger (t-test, p = 
0.001), had worse hearing (p < .0001) and higher education (p = 0.001), 
participated more frequently in the survey (p < .0001), and were less depressed 
(χ2 test, p = 0.003) than the older adults not using HA. General linear mixed 
models consisted of the fixed effects of HA use, follow-up time, and an HA use × 
time interaction term adjusted for age and pure-tone average thresholds at 
baseline, sex, education, and other possible confounders. HA use showed 
significant main effects on the scores for Picture completion and DSST after 
adjustment; scores were better in the HA use group than in the no HA use group. 
The HA use × time interaction was significant for the Information score (p = 
0.040). The model-predicted 12-year slope with centralizing age indicated that 
the no HA use group showed greater decline over time on Information scores than 
did HA use group. The slopes did not differ between HA users and non-users for 
the Similarities, Picture completion and DSST. In conclusion, HA use may have a 
protective effect on the decline in general knowledge in older adults with 
moderate hearing loss.
