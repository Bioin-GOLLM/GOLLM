PARP1 rapidly detects DNA strand break damage and allosterically signals break 
detection to the PARP1 catalytic domain to activate poly(ADP-ribose) production 
from NAD+. PARP1 activation is characterized by dynamic changes in the structure 
of a regulatory helical domain (HD); yet, there are limited insights into the 
specific contributions that the HD makes to PARP1 allostery. Here, we have 
determined crystal structures of PARP1 in isolated active states that display 
specific HD conformations. These captured snapshots and biochemical analysis 
illustrate HD contributions to PARP1 multi-domain and high-affinity interaction 
with DNA damage, provide novel insights into the mechanics of PARP1 allostery, 
and indicate how HD active conformations correspond to alterations in the 
catalytic region that reveal the active site to NAD+. Our work deepens the 
understanding of PARP1 catalytic activation, the dynamics of the binding site of 
PARP inhibitor compounds, and the mechanisms regulating PARP1 retention on DNA 
damage.
