The homeostatic balance of hepatic glucose utilization, storage, and production 
is exquisitely controlled by hormonal signals and hepatic carbon metabolism 
during fed and fasted states. How the liver senses extracellular glucose to cue 
glucose utilization versus production is not fully understood. We show that the 
physiologic balance of hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is regulated by 
Bcl-2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), a protein with roles in apoptosis 
and metabolism. BAD deficiency reprograms hepatic substrate and energy 
metabolism toward diminished glycolysis, excess fatty acid oxidation, and 
exaggerated glucose production that escapes suppression by insulin. Genetic and 
biochemical evidence suggests that BAD's suppression of gluconeogenesis is 
actuated by phosphorylation of its BCL-2 homology (BH)-3 domain and subsequent 
activation of glucokinase. The physiologic relevance of these findings is 
evident from the ability of a BAD phosphomimic variant to counteract 
unrestrained gluconeogenesis and improve glycemia in leptin-resistant and 
high-fat diet models of diabetes and insulin resistance.
