Infection and transmission of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(MDR-Mtb) and extensively drug-resistant M. tuberculosis (XDR-Mtb) is a serious 
health problem. We analyzed a total of 1,110 Mtb isolates in Osaka Prefecture 
and neighboring areas from April 2000 to March 2009. A total of 89 MDR-Mtb were 
identified, 36 (48.5%) of which were determined to be XDR-Mtb. Among the 89 
MDR-Mtb isolates, 24 (27.0%) phylogenetically distributed into six clusters 
based on mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-various number of tandem 
repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing. Among these six clusters, the MIRU-VNTR patterns of 
four (OM-V02, OM-V03, OM-V04, and OM-V06) were only found for MDR-Mtb. Further 
analysis revealed that all isolates belonging to OM-V02 and OM-V03, and two 
isolates from OM-V04 were clonal. Importantly such genotypes were not observed 
for drug-sensitive isolates. These suggest that few but transmissible clones can 
transmit after acquiring multidrug resistance and colonize even in a country 
with a developed, well-organized healthcare system.
