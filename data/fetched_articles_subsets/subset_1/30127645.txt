PURPOSE: No consensus exists on the impact of polymorphisms in cytokines (such 
as interleukin IL-8 and IL-18) on cancer risk; moreover, there is very little 
evidence regarding head and neck cancer (HNC).
METHODS: Thus, a meta-analysis including 22 studies with 4731 cases and 8736 
controls was conducted to evaluate this association. The summary odds ratio (OR) 
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for C-X-C motif chemokine 
ligand 8 (CXCL8, which encodes IL-8) and IL-18 polymorphisms and HNC risk were 
estimated.
RESULTS: The results showed a significantly increased risk of HNC susceptibility 
for IL18 -137 G/C in five genetic models, but, interestingly, no significant 
association was found for the CXCL8 -251 A/T polymorphism. When stratified by 
cancer type, an increased risk of nasopharyngeal cancer was found for both -137 
G/C and -251A/T. When the studies were stratified by ethnicity and genotyping 
method, there were significant associations between Asian populations and 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) 
studies for -137 G/C, and African populations for -251 A/T in some genetic 
models. A positive association was also found between the population-based 
groups in some models for -137 G/C; conversely, significantly decreased risk was 
found among the -251 A/T hospital-based group. Meta-regression was also 
conducted. The publication year, control source, and cancer type contributed to 
CXCL8 -251 A/T heterogeneity; however, no factors were found that contributed to 
IL-18 -137 G/C heterogeneity. Marginal significance was found in the recessive 
model for IL-18 -137 G/C by Egger's test, whereas no publication bias was 
detected for CXCL8 -251 A/T.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the IL-18 -137 G/C polymorphism is 
associated with HNC risk, especially nasopharyngeal cancer, in Asian populations 
and, when using PCR-RFLP, CXCL8 -251 A/T polymorphisms play a complex role in 
HNC development.
