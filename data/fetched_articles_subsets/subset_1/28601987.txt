BACKGROUND: The effects of rs1501299 variant of ADIPO gene on weight loss after 
bariatric surgery have not been evaluated. We decided to investigate the role of 
this genetic variant on anthropometric and biochemical outcomes such as serum 
adiponectin levels after biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) surgery in morbidly 
obese patients during 3 years.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of 64 patients with morbid obesity without 
diabetes mellitus was operated. Biochemical and anthropometric evaluation were 
realized at basal visit and at each visit during 3 years (1, 2, and 3 years).
RESULTS: Percent excess weight loss, body mass index, weight, waist 
circumference, fat mass, blood pressure, fasting glucose, LDL cholesterol, total 
cholesterol, and triglycerides levels improved in both genotype groups. Fasting 
insulin levels and HOMA-IR decreased significantly only in non-T allele 
carriers. The decrease of fasting insulin levels at 3 years (delta -9.2 ± 3.4 vs 
-2.9 ± 2.2 mUI/L; p = 0.01) and HOMA-IR (delta -1.3 ± 0.3 vs -0.8 ± 0.4 units; 
p = 0.03) were higher in non-T allele carriers than T carriers. Adiponectin 
levels increased in all times after surgery in non-T allele carriers, too. The 
increase of adiponectin levels at 3 years (delta 12.2 ± 3.6 vs 1.8 ± 1.2 ng/mL; 
p = 0.01) was higher in non-T allele carriers than T carriers.
CONCLUSION: Non-T allele of ADIPOQ gene variant (rs1501299) is associated with 
increases in adiponectin levels and better improvements of insulin and HOMA-IR 
after BPD massive weight loss. These parameters remained unchanged in T allele 
carriers.
