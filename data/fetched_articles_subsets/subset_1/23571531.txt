Yellow pigments, fomitellanols A (1a) and B (2a), and drimane-type 
sesquiterpenoid ethers of isocitric acid, cryptoporic acids P (3) and Q (4), 
have been isolated from the fruiting bodies of Fomitella fraxinea 
(Polyporaceae). Their structures were established by a combination of extensive 
NMR spectroscopy and/or X-ray crystallographic analyses, and their biological 
activity against COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LO was investigated.
