BACKGROUND: Persons with acute HIV infection (AHI) have heightened transmission 
risk. We evaluated potential transmission reduction using behavioral and 
biomedical interventions in a randomized controlled pilot study in Malawi.
METHODS: Persons were randomized 1:2:2 to standard counseling (SC), 5-session 
behavioral intervention (BI), or behavioral intervention plus 12 weeks of 
antiretrovirals (ARVs; BIA). All were followed for 26-52 weeks and, regardless 
of arm, referred for treatment according to Malawi-ARV guidelines. Participants 
were asked to refer partners for testing.
RESULTS: Among 46 persons (9 SC, 18 BI, 19 BIA), the average age was 28; 61% 
were male. The median viral load (VL) was 5.9 log copies/mL at enrollment. 67% 
(10/15) of BIA participants were suppressed (<1000 copies/mL) at week 12 vs 25% 
BI and 50% SC (P = .07). Although the mean number of reported condomless sexual 
acts in the past week decreased from baseline across all arms (1.5 vs 0.3 acts), 
36% experienced incident sexually transmitted infection by 52 weeks (12% SC, 28% 
BI, 18% BIA). Forty-one percent (19/46) of participants referred partners (44% 
SC, 44% BI, 37% BIA); 15 of the partners were HIV-infected.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of AHI facilitates behavioral and biomedical risk 
reduction strategies during a high-transmission period that begins years before 
people are typically identified and started on ARVs. Sexually transmitted 
infection incidence in this cohort suggests ongoing risk behaviors, reinforcing 
the importance of early intervention with ARVs to reduce transmission. Early 
diagnosis coupled with standard AHI counseling and early ARV referral quickly 
suppresses viremia, may effectively change behavior, and could have tremendous 
public health benefit in reducing onward transmission.
