Retrograde transport of lysosomes is recognised as a critical autophagy 
regulator. Here, we found that acrolein, an aldehyde that is significantly 
elevated in Parkinson's disease patient serum, enhances autophagy by promoting 
lysosomal clustering around the microtubule organising centre via a newly 
identified JIP4-TRPML1-ALG2 pathway. Phosphorylation of JIP4 at T217 by CaMK2G 
in response to Ca2+ fluxes tightly regulated this system. Increased 
vulnerability of JIP4 KO cells to acrolein indicated that lysosomal clustering 
and subsequent autophagy activation served as defence mechanisms against 
cytotoxicity of acrolein itself. Furthermore, the JIP4-TRPML1-ALG2 pathway was 
also activated by H2 O2 , indicating that this system acts as a broad mechanism 
of the oxidative stress response. Conversely, starvation-induced lysosomal 
retrograde transport involved both the TMEM55B-JIP4 and TRPML1-ALG2 pathways in 
the absence of the JIP4 phosphorylation. Therefore, the phosphorylation status 
of JIP4 acts as a switch that controls the signalling pathways of lysosoma l 
distribution depending on the type of autophagy-inducing signal.
