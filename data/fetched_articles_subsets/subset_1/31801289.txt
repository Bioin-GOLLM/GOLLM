The development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), a major cause of 
cancer-related death in the western world, is accompanied with alterations of 
sphingolipid (SL) composition in colon tumors. A number of enzymes involved in 
the SL metabolism have been found to be deregulated in human colon tumors, in 
experimental rodent studies, and in human colon cancer cells in vitro. 
Therefore, the enzymatic pathways that modulate SL levels have received a 
significant attention, due to their possible contribution to CRC development, or 
as potential therapeutic targets. Many of these enzymes are associated with an 
increased sphingosine-1-phosphate/ceramide ratio, which is in turn linked with 
increased colon cancer cell survival, proliferation and cancer progression. 
Nevertheless, more attention should also be paid to the more complex SLs, 
including specific glycosphingolipids, such as lactosylceramides, which can be 
also deregulated during CRC development. In this review, we focus on the 
potential roles of individual SLs/SL metabolism enzymes in colon cancer, as well 
as on the pros and cons of employing the current in vitro models of colon cancer 
cells for lipidomic studies investigating the SL metabolism in CRC.
