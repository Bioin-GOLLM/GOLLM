The connectivity and interplay between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus 
underpin various key cognitive processes, with changes in these interactions 
being implicated in both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. 
Understanding the precise cellular connections through which this circuit is 
organised is, therefore, vital for understanding these same processes. 
Overturning earlier findings, a recent study described a novel excitatory 
projection from anterior cingulate area to dorsal hippocampus. We sought to 
validate this unexpected finding using multiple, complementary methods: 
anterograde and retrograde anatomical tracing, using anterograde and retrograde 
adeno-associated viral vectors, monosynaptic rabies tracing, and the Fast Blue 
classical tracer. Additionally, an extensive data search of the Allen Projection 
Brain Atlas database was conducted to find the stated projection within any of 
the deposited anatomical studies as an independent verification of our own 
results. However, we failed to find any evidence of a direct, monosynaptic 
glutamatergic projection from mouse anterior cingulate cortex to the hippocampus 
proper.
