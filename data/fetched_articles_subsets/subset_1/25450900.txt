BACKGROUND: Eating in the Absence of Hunger (EAH), or consuming highly palatable 
foods when satiated, is one behavioral pathway that may lead to childhood 
obesity. EAH is an objective, laboratory-based measure. A more comprehensive 
understanding of potential determinants of EAH could inform childhood obesity 
programs outside of a laboratory setting.
OBJECTIVE: Systematic review of EAH experiments to identify individual, 
familial, and societal-level correlates of EAH among children 12 years of age or 
younger.
DESIGN: 1487 studies were retrieved from five electronic databases (Medline 
[PubMed], Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO). Eligible studies 
were those that measured EAH as initially operationalized in a laboratory 
setting enrolling children ≤12 years or reporting age-specific results for 
children ≤12 years. Only articles written in English were included.
RESULTS: 12 cross-sectional, six prospective, and one behavioral-intervention 
studies were included in the review. EAH was observable among boys and girls; 
absolute levels of EAH increased with age; and maternal feeding styles were 
associated with EAH among girls. The most consistent evidence supported 
increased levels of EAH among overweight and obese versus normal weight 
children, both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Two studies supported a 
genetic component to EAH.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies enrolling independent samples support a positive 
association between weight status and EAH among children; studies addressing 
causality are needed. Other various individual, genetic, and familiar 
characteristics were associated with EAH, yet studies among more heterogeneous 
sample populations are needed to confirm findings. Studies addressing 
societal-level factors related to EAH were absent.
