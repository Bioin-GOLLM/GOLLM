Determining the aggressiveness of gliomas, termed grading, is a critical step 
toward treatment optimization to increase the survival rate and decrease 
treatment toxicity for patients. Streamlined grading using molecular information 
has the potential to facilitate decision making in the clinic and aid in 
treatment planning. In recent years, molecular markers have increasingly gained 
importance in the classification of tumors. In this study, we propose a novel 
hierarchical voting-based methodology for improving the performance results of 
the feature selection stage and machine learning models for glioma grading with 
clinical and molecular predictors. To identify the best scheme for the given 
soft-voting-based ensemble learning model selections, we utilized publicly 
available TCGA and CGGA datasets and employed four dimensionality reduction 
methods to carry out a voting-based ensemble feature selection and five 
supervised models, with a total of sixteen combination sets. We also compared 
our proposed feature selection method with the LASSO feature selection method in 
isolation. The computational results indicate that the proposed method achieves 
87.606% and 79.668% accuracy rates on TCGA and CGGA datasets, respectively, 
outperforming the LASSO feature selection method.
