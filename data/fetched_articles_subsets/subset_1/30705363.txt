Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is characterised by focal abnormalities of bone 
remodelling, with increased osteoclastic resorption the primary feature of the 
disease. Genetic factors have been shown to play an important role in PDB, and 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 7 genetic loci as 
associated with PDB at the genome-wide level. Expression quantitative trait 
locus (eQTL) studies using cell types that are directly relevant to the disease 
of interest are increasingly being used to identify putative effector genes for 
GWAS loci. We have recently constructed a unique osteoclast-specific eQTL 
resource using cells differentiated in vitro from 158 subjects for study of the 
genetics of bone disease. Considering the major role osteoclasts have in PDB, we 
used this resource to investigate potential genetic regulatory effects for the 7 
PDB genome-wide significant loci on genes located within 500â€‰kb of each locus. 
After correction for multiple testing, we observed statistically significant 
associations for rs4294134 with expression of the gene STMP1, and rs2458413 with 
expression of the genes DPYS and DCSTAMP. The eQTL associations observed for 
rs4294134 with STMP1, and rs2458413 with DCSTAMP were further supported by eQTL 
data from other tissue types. The product of the STMP1 gene has not been 
extensively studied, however the DCSTAMP gene has an established role in 
osteoclast differentiation and the associations seen between rs2458413 and PDB 
are likely mediated through regulatory effects on this gene. This study 
highlights the value of eQTL data in determining which genes are relevant to 
GWAS loci.
