Microtubule-targeted drugs are essential chemotherapeutic agents for various 
types of cancer. A series of 3-vinyl-β-lactams (2-azetidinones) were designed, 
synthesized and evaluated as potential tubulin polymerization inhibitors, and 
for their antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cells. These compounds 
showed potent activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells with an IC50 value of 8 nM 
for compound 7s 
4-[3-Hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl]-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-vinylazetidin-2-one) 
which was comparable to the activity of Combretastatin A-4. Compound 7s had 
minimal cytotoxicity against both non-tumorigenic HEK-293T cells and murine 
mammary epithelial cells. The compounds inhibited the polymerisation of tubulin 
in vitro with an 8.7-fold reduction in tubulin polymerization at 10 M for 
compound 7s and were shown to interact at the colchicine-binding site on 
tubulin, resulting in significant G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. 
Immunofluorescence staining of MCF-7 cells confirmed that β-lactam 7s is 
targeting tubulin and resulted in mitotic catastrophe. A docking simulation 
indicated potential binding conformations for the 3-vinyl-β-lactam 7s in the 
colchicine domain of tubulin. These compounds are promising candidates for 
development as antiproiferative microtubule-disrupting agents.
