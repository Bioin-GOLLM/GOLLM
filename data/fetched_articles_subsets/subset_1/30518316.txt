BACKGROUND: In flowering plants, lipid biosynthesis and transport within anthers 
is essential for male reproductive success. TaMs1, a dominant wheat fertility 
gene located on chromosome 4BS, has been previously fine mapped and identified 
to encode a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored non-specific lipid 
transfer protein (nsLTP). Although this gene is critical for pollen exine 
development, details of its function remains poorly understood.
RESULTS: In this study, we report that TaMs1 is only expressed from the B 
sub-genome, with highest transcript abundance detected in anthers containing 
microspores undergoing pre-meiosis through to meiosis. β-glucuronidase 
transcriptional fusions further revealed that TaMs1 is expressed throughout all 
anther cell-types. TaMs1 was identified to be expressed at an earlier stage of 
anther development relative to genes reported to be necessary for sporopollenin 
precursor biosynthesis. In anthers missing a functional TaMs1 (ms1c deletion 
mutant), these same genes were not observed to be mis-regulated, indicating an 
independent function for TaMs1 in pollen development. Exogenous hormone 
treatments on GUS reporter lines suggest that TaMs1 expression is increased by 
both indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Translational fusion 
constructs showed that TaMs1 is targeted to the plasma membrane.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, TaMs1 is a wheat fertility gene, expressed early in 
anther development and encodes a GPI-LTP targeted to the plasma membrane. The 
work presented provides a new insight into the process of wheat pollen 
development.
