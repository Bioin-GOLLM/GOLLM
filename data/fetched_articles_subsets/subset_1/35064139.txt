Accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein aggregates has been implicated in 
several diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLB), and is thought to spread in a prion-like manner. Elucidating the 
mechanisms of prion-like transmission of α-synuclein is important for the 
development of therapies for these diseases, but little is known about the 
details. Here, we injected α-synuclein fibrils into the brains of wild-type mice 
and examined the early phase of the induction of phosphorylated α-synuclein 
accumulation. We found that phosphorylated α-synuclein appeared within a few 
days after the intracerebral injection. It was observed initially in presynaptic 
regions and subsequently extended its localization to axons and cell 
bodies.　These results suggest that extracellular α-synuclein fibrils are taken 
up into the presynaptic region and seed-dependently convert the endogenous 
normal α-synuclein that is abundant there to an abnormal phosphorylated form, 
which is then transported through the axon to the cell body.
