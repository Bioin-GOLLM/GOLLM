Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as novel gene expression regulators. Recent 
evidence strongly suggests a role for miRNAs in a large variety of 
cancer-related pathways. Different studies have shown that 18.7 to 37% of all 
human miRNA genes are clustered. miR-17-92 polycistronic cluster overexpression 
is associated with human hematolymphoid and solid malignancies including breast 
cancer (BC). Here, we report the identification of rs770419845, a rare 6 bp 
deletion located within the polycistronic miR-17-92 cluster, in two first-degree 
relatives from a Chilean family with familial BC and negative for point 
mutations in BRCA 1/2 genes. The deletion was identified by Sanger sequencing 
when 99 BRCA1/2 mutation-negative BC cases with a strong family history were 
initially screened. In silico analysis predicts that rs770419845 affects the 
secondary structure and stability of the pre-miR-17-pre-miR-18 region and the 
entire 17-92 cluster. The deletion was screened in 458 high-risk 
BRCA1/2-negative Chilean families and 480 controls. rs770419845 was not detected 
in any control but identified in a single family with two cases of BC and other 
cancers. Both BC cases, the mother and her daughter, carried the deletion. Based 
on bioinformatic analyses, the location of the deletion and its low frequency, 
we presume rs770419845 may be a pathogenic variant. Functional studies are 
needed to support this hypothesis.
