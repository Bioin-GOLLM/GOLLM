BACKGROUND: The role of IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL36RN), a mutated gene 
expression of IL-36 in periodontitis patients with peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC) and plasma remains to be undetermined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study discovered the IL36RN expression through GEO 
public databases and further validated by PBMC and plasma of periodontitis 
patients and healthy participants. A total of 194 participants of public 
datasets, consisting of 97 cases of periodontitis and 97 cases of healthy 
control were retrospectively evaluated and explored the gene enrichment pathways 
and clinical significance of IL36RN expression accompanied by three different 
cytokines. Furthermore, the clinical significance of IL36RN was evaluated in 
mild-to-severe patients of periodontitis by the receiver operating curve (ROC) 
using the area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: IL36RN expressions were notably down-regulated in PBMC and plasma of 
periodontitis patients. Further, a positive correlation of IL36RN expression was 
significantly observed between PBMC and plasma of periodontitis patients while 
IL36RN expression was negatively correlated to serum-based three different 
cytokines of periodontitis patients. Meanwhile, the ROC-AUCs achieved a 
significantly higher range from 0.80 to 0.87 with PBMC of mild-to-severe and 
moderate-to-severe periodontitis patients whereas similar patients with plasma 
obtained a significant AUC range from 0.73 to 0.83.
CONCLUSION: IL36RN can distinctively be detectable in periodontitis patients 
with PBMC and plasma, which can act as a down-regulated mutated gene that might 
play an effective role in causing periodontitis. IL36RN may involve by other 
inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.
