Hereditary amyloidosis: description of a new American kindred with late onset 
cardiomyopathy. Appalachian amyloid.

Benson MD, Wallace MR, Tejada E, Baumann H, Page B.

A family with hereditary amyloidosis characterized by peripheral neuropathy and 
cardiomyopathy is described. Lack of eye involvement sets their disease apart 
from the Indiana/Swiss familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy type II. The disease 
is of late onset; affected members die of cardiomyopathy after age 60. The late 
onset and lack of clinically significant neuropathy in several family members 
has led to misdiagnosis of the cardiomyopathy. Immunohistochemistry using 
antiprealbumin antiserum showed staining of amyloid deposits in nerve and heart.
