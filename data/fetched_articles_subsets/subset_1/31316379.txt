Animal studies of effort-based choice behavior are being used to model 
effort-related motivational dysfunctions in humans. With these procedures, 
animals are offered a choice between high-effort instrumental actions leading to 
highly valued reinforcers vs. low effort/low reward options. Several previous 
studies have shown that dopamine (DA) uptake inhibitors, including GBR12909, 
lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and PRX-14040, can reverse the effort-related 
effects of the vesicular monoamine transport blocker tetrabenazine, which 
inhibits DA storage. Because many drugs that block DA transport act as major 
stimulants that also release DA, and produce a number of undesirable side 
effects, there is a need to develop and characterize novel atypical DA transport 
inhibitors. (S)-CE-123 ((S)-5-((benzhydrylsulfinyl) methyl)thiazole) is a 
recently developed analog of modafinil with the biochemical characteristics of 
an atypical DA transport blocker. The present paper describes the 
enantioselective synthesis and initial chemical characterization of (S)-CE-123, 
as well as behavioral experiments involving effort-based choice and 
microdialysis studies of extracellular DA. Rats were assessed using the fixed 
ratio 5/chow feeding choice test. Tetrabenazine (1.0 mg/kg) shifted choice 
behavior, decreasing lever pressing and increasing chow intake. (S)-CE-123 was 
coadministered at doses ranging from 6.0 to 24.0 mg/kg, and the highest dose 
partially but significantly reversed the effects of tetrabenazine, although this 
dose had no effect on fixed ratio responding when administered alone. Additional 
experiments showed that (S)-CE-123 significantly increased lever pressing on a 
progressive ratio/chow feeding choice task and that the effective dose (24.0 
mg/kg) increased extracellular DA in nucleus accumbens core. In summary, 
(S)-CE-123 has the behavioral and neurochemical profile of a compound that can 
block DA transport, reverse the effort-related effects of tetrabenazine, and 
increase selection of high-effort progressive ratio responding. This suggests 
that (S)-CE-123 or a similar compound could be useful as a treatment for 
effort-related motivational dysfunction in humans.
