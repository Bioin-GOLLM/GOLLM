Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and devastating syndrome 
that contributes to serious morbidities and mortality in critically ill 
patients. No known pharmacologic therapy is beneficial in the treatment of ARDS, 
and the only effective management is through a protective lung strategy. 
Platelets play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, and antiplatelet 
therapy may be a potential medication for ARDS. In this review, we introduce the 
overall pathogenesis of ARDS, and then focus on platelet-related mechanisms 
underlying the development of ARDS, including platelet adhesion to the injured 
vessel wall, platelet-leukocyte-endothelium interactions, platelet-related lipid 
mediators, and neutrophil extracellular traps. We further summarize antiplatelet 
therapy, including aspirin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, and 
P2Y12 inhibitors for ARDS in experimental and clinical studies and a 
meta-analysis. Novel aspirin-derived agents, aspirin-triggered lipoxin, and 
aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 are also described here. In this narrative review, 
we summarize the current knowledge of the role of platelets in the pathogenesis 
of ARDS, and the potential benefits of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention 
and treatment of ARDS.
