EGFR oncogenic mutations predict sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC, but 
less is known about EGFR "variants of unknown significance." Using preclinical 
models, 3D structure analyses, and patient response data, Robichaux et al. show 
in Nature that mutations in structural regions of EGFR predict responses to 
different EGFR inhibitors.
