The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is inappropriately activated in 
obesity. In individuals at risk for diabetes, RAAS inhibition protects against 
kidney and heart disease, and also reduces the incidence of diabetes in large 
clinical trials. At a cellular level, angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone 
induce insulin resistance by increasing oxidative stress and altering insulin 
signaling, leading to decreased glucose transport. Ang II also contributes to 
oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in pancreatic β cells. Aldosterone 
diminishes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo and in vitro from 
isolated pancreatic islets and cultured β cells through a mineralocorticoid 
receptor (MR)-independent mechanism. We review these findings in the context of 
pharmacological strategies interrupting the RAAS to highlight the potential 
application of these strategies to the prevention of diabetes progression.
