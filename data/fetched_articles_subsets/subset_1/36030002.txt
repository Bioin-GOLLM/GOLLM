We describe the synthesis of a series of 3-t-butyl 5-aminopyrazole p-substituted 
arylamides as inhibitors of serine-threonine25 (STK25), an enzyme implicated in 
the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Appending a 
p-N-pyrrolidinosulphonamide group to the arylamide group led to a 'first-in 
kind' inhibitor with IC50 = 228 nM. A co-crystal structure with STK 25 revealed 
productive interactions which were also reproduced using molecular docking. A 
new series of triazolo dihydro oxazine carboxamides of 3-t-butyl 5-aminopyrazole 
was not active against STK25.
