Interactions of the CHMP protein carboxyl terminal tails with effector proteins 
play important roles in retroviral budding, cytokinesis, and multivesicular body 
biogenesis. Here we demonstrate that hydrophobic residues at the CHMP4B 
C-terminal amphipathic α helix bind a concave surface of Brox, a mammalian 
paralog of Alix. Unexpectedly, CHMP5 was also found to bind Brox and 
specifically recruit endogenous Brox to detergent-resistant membrane fractions 
through its C-terminal 20 residues. Instead of an α helix, the CHMP5 C-terminal 
tail adopts a tandem β-hairpin structure that binds Brox at the same site as 
CHMP4B. Additional Brox:CHMP5 interface is furnished by a unique CHMP5 
hydrophobic pocket engaging the Brox residue Y348 that is not conserved among 
the Bro1 domains. Our studies thus unveil a β-hairpin conformation of the CHMP5 
protein C-terminal tail, and provide insights into the overlapping but distinct 
binding profiles of ESCRT-III and the Bro1 domain proteins.
