Purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria (PNSB) such as Rhodobacter capsulatus 
serve as a versatile platform for fundamental studies and various 
biotechnological applications. In this study, we sought to develop the class II 
RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas12a system from Francisella novicida for genome editing and 
transcriptional regulation in R. capsulatus. Template-free disruption method 
mediated by CRISPR/Cas12a reached ˜ 90% editing efficiency when targeting ccoO 
or nifH gene. When both genes were simultaneously edited, the multiplex editing 
efficiency reached > 63%. In addition, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) using 
deactivated Cas12a was also evaluated using reporter genes egfp and lacZ, and 
the transcriptional repression efficiency reached ˜ 80%. In summary, our work 
represents the first report to develop CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated genome editing and 
transcriptional regulation in R. capsulatus, which would greatly accelerate 
PNSB-related researches.
