Hemiplegic migraine (HM) is a rare variant of migraine with aura, characterized 
by migrainous headache and fully reversible motor deficit within 24 hours. Both 
sporadic and familial forms of HMs are genetically heterogenous with little 
information on neuroimaging during and after acute attacks. We report 2 cases of 
children with presumed HM and late cytotoxic edema.
