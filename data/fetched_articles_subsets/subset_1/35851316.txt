BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral large artery and small vessel diseases are 
related to different pathogenetic mechanisms and have different risk factor 
profile. Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) was shown to promote atherosclerosis but data 
was limited on its association with cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVD). The 
objective of this study was to assess the associations of Lp(a) level with the 
two types of cerebrovascular diseases.
METHODS: Community-dwelling subjects aged 50-75 years from the baseline survey 
of The PolyvasculaR Evaluation for Cognitive Impairment and vaScular Events 
study were included. Lp(a) concentrations was measured and categorised into 
three groups according to the tertiles. Eligible participants were scanned by a 
3.0T MRI scanner and assessed for intracranial atherosclerosis and cSVD burden 
based on four imaging markers.
RESULTS: This study included 3059 subjects. The average age of the participants 
was 61.2±6.7 years, and 53.5% (1636) were female. Compared with the first 
tertile, subjects with the second and third tertiles of Lp(a) concentrations 
were associated with an increased odds of presence of intracranial plaque (18.7% 
vs 15.4%, adj.OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.75; 18.9% vs 15.4%, adj.OR 1.34, 95% CI 
1.05 to 1.72). Similar associations were observed for intracranial 
atherosclerotic burden. Whereas, subjects with the third tertile of Lp(a) level 
had a decreased odds of presence of cSVD (25.9% vs 31.7%, adj.OR 0.74, 95% CI 
0.60 to 0.92) and lower cSVD burden (adj.cOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Lp(a) concentrations were positively associated with 
presence and burden of intracranial atherosclerosis, but was inversely 
associated with cSVD.
