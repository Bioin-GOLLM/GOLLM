Amyloid β (Aβ) oligomer-induced aberrant neurotransmitter release is proposed to 
be a crucial early event leading to synapse dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). In the present study, we report that the release probability (Pr) at the 
synapse between the Schaffer collateral (SC) and CA1 pyramidal neurons is 
significantly reduced at an early stage in mouse models of AD with elevated Aβ 
production. High nanomolar synthetic oligomeric Aβ42 also suppresses Pr at the 
SC-CA1 synapse in wild-type mice. This Aβ-induced suppression of Pr is mainly 
due to an mGluR5-mediated depletion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 
(PIP2) in axons. Selectively inhibiting Aβ-induced PIP2 hydrolysis in the CA3 
region of the hippocampus strongly prevents oligomeric Aβ-induced suppression of 
Pr at the SC-CA1 synapse and rescues synaptic and spatial learning and memory 
deficits in APP/PS1 mice. These results first reveal the presynaptic mGluR5-PIP2 
pathway whereby oligomeric Aβ induces early synaptic deficits in AD.
