loss of channel function.

We explored the clinico-genetic basis of spinocerebellar ataxia 29 (SCA29) by 
determining the frequency, phenotype, and functional impact of ITPR1 missense 
variants associated with early-onset ataxia (EOA). Three hundred thirty one 
patients from a European EOA target cohort (n = 120), US-American EOA validation 
cohort (n = 72), and early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) control cohort 
(n = 139) were screened for de novo ITPR1 variants. The target cohort was also 
screened for inherited ITPR1 variants. The variants' functional impact was 
determined by IP3-induced Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells. 3/120 patients (2.5%) 
from the target cohort and 4/72 patients (5.5%) from the validation cohort, but 
none from the EOEE control cohort, carried de novo ITPR1 variants. However, most 
ITPR1 variants (7/10 = 70%) in the target cohort were inherited from a healthy 
parent, with 3/6 patients carrying disease-causing variants in other genes. This 
suggests limited or no phenotypic impact of many ITPR1 missense variants, even 
if ultra-rare and well-conserved. While common bioinformatics tools did not 
discriminate de novo from other ITPR1 variants, functional characterization 
demonstrated reduced IP3-induced Ca2+ release for all de novo variants, 
including the recurrent c.805C>T (p.(R269W)) variant. In sum, these findings 
show that de novo ITPR1 missense variants are a recurrent cause of EOA (SCA29) 
across independent cohorts, acting via loss of IP3 channel function. Inherited 
ITPR1 variants are also enriched in EOA, but often without strong impact, albeit 
rare and well-conserved. Functional studies allow identifying ITPR1 variants 
with large impact, likely disease-causing. Such functional confirmation is 
warranted for inherited ITPR1 variants before making a SCA29 diagnosis.
