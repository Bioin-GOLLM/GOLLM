Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is a post-translational modification of 
proteins mediated by PARP family members, such as PARP-1. Although PARylation 
has been studied extensively, few examples of definitive biological roles for 
site-specific PARylation have been reported. Here we show that C/EBPβ, a key 
pro-adipogenic transcription factor, is PARylated by PARP-1 on three amino acids 
in a conserved regulatory domain. PARylation at these sites inhibits C/EBPβ's 
DNA binding and transcriptional activities and attenuates adipogenesis in 
various genetic and cell-based models. Interestingly, PARP-1 catalytic activity 
drops precipitously during the first 48 hr of differentiation, corresponding to 
a release of C/EBPβ from PARylation-mediated inhibition. This promotes the 
binding of C/EBPβ at enhancers controlling the expression of adipogenic target 
genes and continued differentiation. Depletion or chemical inhibition of PARP-1, 
or mutation of the PARylation sites on C/EBPβ, enhances these early adipogenic 
events. Collectively, our results provide a clear example of how site-specific 
PARylation drives biological outcomes.
