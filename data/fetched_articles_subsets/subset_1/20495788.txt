INTRODUCTION: The neurotransmitter dopamine has frequently been implicated in 
reward processing but is also, increasingly, implicated in punishment 
processing. We have previously shown that both patients with Parkinson's disease 
and healthy individuals with low dopamine (DA) synthesis are better at reversal 
learning based on punishment than reward. Here, we extend these prior findings 
by examining the effects of artificially reducing DA synthesis in healthy 
individuals performing this previously employed task.
METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we applied the 
acute tyrosine and phenylalanine depletion (ATPD) procedure to reduce global DA 
synthesis in 15 female and 14 male subjects. Each subject performed the reward- 
and punishment-based reversal-learning paradigm.
RESULTS: There was a significant three-way interaction between ATPD, the valence 
of the outcome signalling reversal and the gender of the participants. 
Examination of punishment and reward-based reversals separately revealed that 
this was driven by a significant improvement in punishment processing in female 
but not male subjects following DA depletion.
CONCLUSIONS: Reducing DA synthesis in healthy individuals shifted sensitivity of 
performance from reward to punishment processing. Gender differences in DA 
synthesis might underlie the selectivity of this effect to female subjects. Such 
gender biases may go some way towards explaining the gender biases in certain 
psychiatric disorders such as depression and Parkinson's disease.
