BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection may be a risk factor for pancreatic 
cancer, particularly infection by strains without the cytotoxin-associated gene 
A (CagA) virulence factor. Non-O blood type is a known risk factor for 
pancreatic cancer, and H. pylori gastric colonization occurs largely from 
bacterial adhesins binding to blood group antigens on gastric mucosa.
METHODS: We included 485 pancreatic cancer cases and 1,122 matched controls from 
5 U.S. prospective cohorts. Prediagnostic plasma samples were assessed for H. 
pylori and CagA antibody titers. Conditional logistic regression was used to 
estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pancreatic 
cancer. ABO blood type was assessed using genetic polymorphisms at the ABO gene 
locus or self-report.
RESULTS: Compared with H. pylori -seronegative participants, those who were 
seropositive did not demonstrate an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (OR 
0.83, 95% CI 0.65-1.06). This lack of association was similar among 
CagA-seropositive (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53-1.04) and -seronegative (OR 0.89, 95% CI 
0.65-1.20) participants. The association was also similar when stratified by 
time between blood collection and cancer diagnosis ( P -interaction = 0.80). 
Consistent with previous studies, non-O blood type was associated with increased 
pancreatic cancer risk, but this increase in risk was similar regardless of H. 
pylori seropositivity ( P -interaction = 0.51).
DISCUSSION: In this nested case-control study, history of H. pylori infection as 
determined by H. pylori antibody serology was not associated with pancreatic 
cancer risk, regardless of CagA virulence factor status. The elevated risk 
associated with non-O blood type was consistent in those with or without H. 
pylori seropositivity.
