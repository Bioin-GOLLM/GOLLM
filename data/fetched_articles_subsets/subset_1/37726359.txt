Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder associated with a reduced 
fertility and decreased life expectancy, yet common predisposing variation 
substantially contributes to the onset of the disorder, which poses an 
evolutionary paradox. Previous research has suggested balanced selection, a 
mechanism by which schizophrenia risk alleles could also provide advantages 
under certain environments, as a reliable explanation. However, recent studies 
have shown strong evidence against a positive selection of predisposing loci. 
Furthermore, evolutionary pressures on schizophrenia risk alleles could have 
changed throughout human history as new environments emerged. Here in this 
study, we used 1000 Genomes Project data to explore the relationship between 
schizophrenia predisposing loci and recent natural selection (RNS) signatures 
after the human diaspora out of Africa around 100,000 years ago on a genome-wide 
scale. We found evidence for significant enrichment of RNS markers in derived 
alleles arisen during human evolution conferring protection to schizophrenia. 
Moreover, both partitioned heritability and gene set enrichment analyses of 
mapped genes from schizophrenia predisposing loci subject to RNS revealed a 
lower involvement in brain and neuronal related functions compared to those not 
subject to RNS. Taken together, our results suggest non-antagonistic pleiotropy 
as a likely mechanism behind RNS that could explain the persistence of 
schizophrenia common predisposing variation in human populations due to its 
association to other non-psychiatric phenotypes.
