BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine H2-receptor antagonists 
(H2RAs) are commonly prescribed to people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) to treat 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and/or protect pancreatic enzymes from 
degradation in the stomach. Acid suppressive medications (ASMs) could 
theoretically reduce hemoglobin (Hgb) levels by restricting enteral iron 
absorption, but evidence of an association between use of ASMs and lower Hgb 
levels is lacking in PwCF.
METHODS: We used unadjusted and covariate-adjusted generalized linear mixed 
models (GLMMs) to estimate the fixed effects of using versus never using ASMs on 
annual Hgb levels of PwCF in the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient 
Registry (CFFPR) from 2011 to 2017.
RESULTS: There were 9850 users and 9007 never-users of ASMs from 2011 to 2017 
who met inclusion criteria. Not adjusting for covariates, Hgb estimates were 
lower for male and female H2RA and/or PPI users versus never-users. Adjusting 
for covariates, mean Hgb was 0.1 g/dl (95% CI: 0.03, 0.17) lower for males that 
exclusively used PPIs than it was for male never-users of ASMs (p = .008). 
Adjusting for covariates, mean Hgb levels were 0.11 g/dl (95% CI: 0.04, 0.18) 
lower for females that exclusively used PPIs and 0.16 g/dl (95% CI: 0.05, 0.27) 
lower for females that used PPIs and H2RAs concurrently than it was for female 
never-users of ASMs (p = .005 and p = .002 for respective comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS: Males and females with cystic fibrosis (CF) who used PPIs and 
females with CF who concurrently used PPIs and H2RAs had lower Hgb levels than 
never-users of ASMs of the same sex in the CFFPR from 2011 to 2017.
