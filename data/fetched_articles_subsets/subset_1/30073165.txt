Endocannabinoids are important players in neural development and function. They 
act via receptors, whose activation inhibits cAMP production. The aim of the 
paper was to look for calcium- and cAMP-signaling cross-talk mediated by 
cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1R) and to assess the relevance of EF-hand CaM-like 
calcium sensors in this regard. Using a heterologous expression system, we 
demonstrated that CB1R interacts with calneuron-1 and NCS1 but not with 
caldendrin. Furthermore, interaction motives were identified in both calcium 
binding proteins and the receptor, and we showed that the first two sensors 
competed for binding to the receptor in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Assays in 
neuronal primary cultures showed that, CB1R-NCS1 complexes predominate at basal 
Ca2+ levels, whereas in the presence of ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, 
CB1R-calneuron-1 complexes were more abundant. Signaling assays following 
forskolin-induced intracellular cAMP levels showed in mouse striatal neurons 
that binding of CB1R to NCS1 is required for CB1R-mediated signaling, while the 
binding of CB1R to calneuron-1 completely blocked Gi-mediated signaling in 
response to a selective receptor agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide. 
Calcium levels and interaction with calcium sensors may even lead to apparent Gs 
coupling after CB1R agonist challenge.
