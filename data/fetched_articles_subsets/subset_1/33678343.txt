OBJECTIVE: Skeletal dysplasias, caused by genetic mutations, are a heterogenous 
group of heritable disorders affecting bone development during fetal life. 
Stickler syndrome, one of the skeletal dysplasias, is an autosomal dominant 
connective tissue disorder caused by abnormal collagen synthesis owing to a 
genetic mutation in COL2A1.
CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 38-year-old multipara woman whose first 
trimester screening showed a normal karyotype. However, the bilateral femur and 
humerus length symmetrically shortened after 20 weeks. Next-generation 
sequencing for mutations in potential genes leading to skeletal dysplasia 
detected a novel de novo mutation (c.1438G > A, p.Gly480Arg) in COL2A1, causing 
Stickler syndrome type 1. This pathogenic mutation might impair or destabilize 
the collagen structure, leading to collagen type II, IX, and XI dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: We identified a novel de novo mutation in COL2A1 related to the STL1 
syndrome and delineated the extent of the skeletal dysplasia disease spectrum.
