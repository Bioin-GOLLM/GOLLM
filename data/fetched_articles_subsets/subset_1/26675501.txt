Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underlie most biological processes. An 
increasing interest to investigate the unexplored potential of PPIs in drug 
discovery is driven by the need to find novel therapeutic targets for a whole 
range of diseases with a high unmet medical need. To date, PPI inhibition with 
small molecules is the mechanism that has most often been explored, resulting in 
significant progress towards drug development. However, also PPI stabilization 
is gradually gaining ground. In this review, we provide a focused overview of a 
number of PPIs that control critical regulatory pathways and constitute targets 
for the design of novel therapeutics. We discuss PPI-modulating small molecules 
that are already pursued in clinical trials. In addition, we review a number of 
PPIs that are still under preclinical investigation but for which preliminary 
data support their use as therapeutic targets.
