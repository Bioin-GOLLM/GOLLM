BACKGROUND: Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD 88) is an 
intracellular adapter protein that mediates the early immune response to 
pathogens. Toll-like receptors (except TLR-3) induce the immune response through 
a MyD 88-dependent signal pathway.
AIMS: We aimed to investigate the MyD 88 polymorphisms that play important roles 
in the immune response in septic children and to evaluate whether or not they 
were risk factors in the development of sepsis.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study.
METHODS: Sixty-five patients diagnosed with sepsis in the Pediatric Intensive 
Care Unit during the period from April 2010 to January 2012 were included as the 
study group. Sixty-five children without sepsis were included as controls. After 
DNA was obtained from blood samples in the study and control groups, MyD 88 
polymorphisms were analyzed. According to the genotype and allele frequencies, 
the distributions of MyD 88 polymorphisms [Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
- 938 C/A (rs4988453), MyD 88 SNP 1944 C/G (rs4988457)] were analyzed in both 
the study and control groups.
RESULTS: The C/C genotype of MyD 88 SNP -938 was significantly more common than 
the C/A genotype in the patient group (p=0.002). No statistically significant 
difference in the frequency of the MyD 88 SNP 1944 genotype was found between 
the study and control groups (p=0.272).
CONCLUSION: Gene polymorphism studies could elucidate our understanding of 
sepsis in terms of prevalence and the management of treatment. It was shown in 
this study that children with the MyD 88 SNP -938 C/C genotype had a greater 
tendency toward sepsis. However, additional studies should be performed.
