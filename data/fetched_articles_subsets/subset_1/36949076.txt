Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that causes human African 
trypanosomiasis. Its major surface antigen VSG is expressed from subtelomeric 
loci in a strictly monoallelic manner. We previously showed that the telomere 
protein TbRAP1 binds dsDNA through its 737RKRRR741 patch to silence VSGs 
globally. How TbRAP1 permits expression of the single active VSG is unknown. 
Through NMR structural analysis, we unexpectedly identify an RNA Recognition 
Motif (RRM) in TbRAP1, which is unprecedented for RAP1 homologs. Assisted by the 
737RKRRR741 patch, TbRAP1 RRM recognizes consensus sequences of VSG 3'UTRs in 
vitro and binds the active VSG RNA in vivo. Mutating conserved RRM residues 
abolishes the RNA binding activity, significantly decreases the active VSG RNA 
level, and derepresses silent VSGs. The competition between TbRAP1's RNA and 
dsDNA binding activities suggests a VSG monoallelic expression mechanism in 
which the active VSG's abundant RNA antagonizes TbRAP1's silencing effect, 
thereby sustaining its full-level expression.
