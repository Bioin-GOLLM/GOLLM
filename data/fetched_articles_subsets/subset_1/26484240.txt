The tumor microenvironment is generally hypoxic because of the limited oxygen 
supply from inefficient or insufficient vasculature. Hypoxic tumor tissues are 
also poorly supplied with serum components. We have previously demonstrated that 
expression of the FVII gene is induced in response to hypoxia in ovarian clear 
cell carcinoma (CCC) cells. This gene activation is synergistically enhanced 
when cells are simultaneously subjected to serum starvation, and is dependent on 
the transcription factor Sp1 directly associating with the FVII promoter. We 
have identified additional genes activated via a similar Sp1-dependent mechanism 
by conducting cDNA microarray analysis (GSE55565). ICAM1, which encodes 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), is one such gene. ICAM-1 confers an 
anti-apoptotic effect upon CCC cells in vitro and promotes growth of CCC tumors. 
Here we describe the transcriptome analysis performed in our recently published 
study (Koizume et al., 2015). We further show that autonomous activation of the 
TNFα-NFκB axis is responsible for the synergistic activation of ICAM1 under 
hypoxic and serum starvation conditions. This study provides additional 
information as to how CCC cell survival can be facilitated under conditions of 
serum starvation and hypoxia.
