EML4-ALK fusion, observed in about 3%-7% of human lung adenocarcinoma, is one of 
the most important oncogenic drivers in initiating lung tumorigenesis. However, 
it still remains largely unknown about how EML4-ALK fusion exactly fires 
downstream signaling and drives lung cancer formation. We here find that 
EML4-ALK variant 1 (exon 1-13 of EML4 fused to exon 20-29 of ALK) forms 
condensates via phase separation in the cytoplasm of various human cancer cell 
lines. Using two genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), we find that 
EML4-ALK variant 1 can drive lung tumorigenesis and these murine tumors, as well 
as primary tumor-derived organoids, clearly show the condensates of EML4-ALK 
protein, further supporting the findings from in vitro study. Mutation of 
multiple aromatic residues in EML4 region significantly impairs the phase 
separation of EML4-ALK and dampens the activation of the downstream signaling 
pathways, especially the STAT3 phosphorylation. Importantly, it also 
significantly decreases cancer malignant transformation and tumor formation. 
These data together highlight an important role of phase separation in 
orchestrating EML4-ALK signaling and promoting tumorigenesis, which might 
provide new clues for the development of clinical therapeutic strategies in 
treating lung cancer patients with the EML4-ALK fusion.
