In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted much attention because of 
their prominent role in cancer. An increasing number of studies have shown that 
miRNAs play an important role in a variety of tumors. miR-608 has been reported 
to be decreased in cancers, especially in solid tumors. miR-608 is regarded as a 
tumor suppressor, which has been verified through a large number of experiments 
both in vivo and in vitro. miR-608 participates in many biological processes, 
including cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis, by inhibiting 
transmembrane proteins and many signaling pathways. Here, we summarize the 
expression profile and biological functions and mechanism of miR-608, suggesting 
that miR-608 is an ideal diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and a treatment 
target for cancer.
