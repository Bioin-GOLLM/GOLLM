Steroid sulfatase (STS) plays an important role in the regulation of steroid 
hormones. Metabolism of steroid hormones in zebrafish has been investigated, but 
the action of steroid sulfatase remains unknown. In this study, a zebrafish sts 
was cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized in comparison with the 
orthologous human enzyme. Enzymatic assays demonstrated that similar to human 
STS, zebrafish Sts was most active in catalyzing the hydrolysis of 
estrone-sulfate and estradiol-sulfate, among five steroid sulfates tested as 
substrates. Kinetic analyses revealed that the Km values of zebrafish Sts and 
human STS differed with respective substrates, but the catalytic efficiency as 
reflected by the Vmax/Km appeared comparable, except for DHEA-sulfate with which 
zebrafish Sts appeared less efficient. While zebrafish Sts was catalytically 
active at 28 °C, the enzyme appeared more active at 37 °C and with similar Km 
values to those determined at 28 °C. Assays performed in the presence of 
different divalent cations showed that the activities of both zebrafish and 
human STSs were stimulated by Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+, and inhibited by Zn+2 and 
Fe2+. EMATE and STX64, two known mammalian steroid sulafatase inhibitors, were 
shown to be capable of inhibiting the activity of zebrafish Sts. Collectively, 
the results obtained indicated that zebrafish Sts exhibited enzymatic 
characteristics comparable to the human STS, suggesting that the physiological 
function of STS may be conserved between zebrafish and humans.
