BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) and accelerated atherosclerosis are 
major causes of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in haemodialysis 
(HD) patients. Inhibitory proteins are associated with reduced VC and may play a 
key role in preventing CV in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Fetuin-A, 
also known as alpha(2)-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG), is a circulating 
plasma protein with inhibitory effects on VC that has been associated with 
inflammation and CV mortality in HD patients. In the present study, we 
investigated the associations between serum fetuin-A levels and its gene (AHSG) 
polymorphisms in an Italian HD population.
METHODS: Ninety-six patients on stable chronic HD treatment and 57 healthy 
controls were genotyped for the common polymorphisms on the AHSG (T256S). In 
addition, serum fetuin-A levels were tested.
RESULTS: In this study, serum fetuin-A levels were lower in HD patients (0.35 
+/- 0.11 g/l) compared with healthy controls (0.62 +/- 0.31 g/l, p < 0.05). In 
both HD patients and the control group, the distribution of the AHSG gene did 
not show significant association between low serum fetuin-A levels and the 
Ser/Ser genotype, known to be associated with a higher CV mortality risk in the 
HD population. Moreover, the distribution of AHSG gene polymorphisms in HD 
patients and in healthy controls was similar.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with previous reports, this study suggests that CKD 
patients on HD treatment have a similar polymorphism distribution of the AHSG 
gene compared with the normal population and that the reduction in serum 
fetuin-A levels in Italian HD patients is not associated with an alteration in 
the distribution of AHSG T256S polymorphisms.
