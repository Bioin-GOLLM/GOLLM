Recurrent copy-number variations (CNVs) at chromosome 16p11.2 are associated 
with neurodevelopmental diseases, skeletal system abnormalities, anemia, and 
genitourinary defects. Among the 40 protein-coding genes encompassed within the 
rearrangement, some have roles in leukocyte biology and immunodeficiency, like 
SPN and CORO1A. We therefore investigated leukocyte differential counts and 
disease in 16p11.2 CNV carriers. In our clinically-recruited cohort, we 
identified three deletion carriers from two families (out of 32 families 
assessed) with neutropenia and lymphopenia. They had no deleterious 
single-nucleotide or indel variant in known cytopenia genes, suggesting a 
possible causative role of the deletion. Noticeably, all three individuals had 
the lowest copy number of the human-specific BOLA2 duplicon (copy-number range: 
3-8). Consistent with the lymphopenia and in contrast with the neutropenia 
associations, adult deletion carriers from UK biobank (n = 74) showed lower 
lymphocyte (Padj = 0.04) and increased neutrophil (Padj = 8.31e-05) counts. 
Mendelian randomization studies pinpointed to reduced CORO1A, KIF22, and 
BOLA2-SMG1P6 expressions being causative for the lower lymphocyte counts. In 
conclusion, our data suggest that 16p11.2 deletion, and possibly also the lowest 
dosage of the BOLA2 duplicon, are associated with low lymphocyte counts. There 
is a trend between 16p11.2 deletion with lower copy-number of the BOLA2 duplicon 
and higher susceptibility to moderate neutropenia. Higher numbers of cases are 
warranted to confirm the association with neutropenia and to resolve the 
involvement of the deletion coupled with deleterious variants in other genes 
and/or with the structure and copy number of segments in the CNV breakpoint 
regions.
