We present the interim results of the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of 
the two-dose schedules of TURKOVAC versus CoronaVac. This was a randomized, 
observer-blinded, non-inferiority trial (NCT04942405). Volunteers were 18-55 
years old and randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either TURKOVAC or CoronaVac 
at Day 0 and Day 28, both of which are 3 μg/0.5 mL of inactivated severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide. 
The primary efficacy outcome was the prevention of polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at least 14 days 
after the second dose in the modified per-protocol (mPP) group. Safety analyses 
were performed in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) group. Between 22 June 
2021 and 7 January 2022, 1290 participants were randomized. The mITT group 
consisted of 915 participants, and the mPP group consisted of 732 participants. 
During a median follow-up of 90 (IQR 86-90) days, the relative risk reduction 
with TURKOVAC compared to CoronaVac was 41.03% (95% CI 12.95-60.06) for 
preventing PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19. The incidences of adverse events 
(AEs) overall were 58.8% in TURKOVAC and 49.7% in CoronaVac arms (p = 0.006), 
with no fatalities or grade four AEs. TURKOVAC was non-inferior to CoronaVac in 
terms of efficacy and demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile.
