CONTEXT: The potential impact of severe periodontitis on glycemia in 
systemically healthy individuals is not clearly established. It was hypothesized 
that among individuals who were previously undiagnosed for diabetes mellitus, 
patients with severe periodontitis have impaired glycemia and insulin 
resistance.
AIMS: The aim of our study was to assess and compare glycemia in severe 
periodontitis patients and in individuals with clinically healthy periodontium.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical design was employed. From 
among individuals who were undiagnosed for diabetes mellitus, 37 patients with 
severe periodontitis and 37 individuals with healthy periodontium in the age 
group of 25-55 years were recruited for the study. The fasting blood sugar 
(FBS), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and insulin resistance by the 
Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were assessed and 
compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The mean FBS, HOMA-IR, and HbA1c were significantly higher for patients 
with severe periodontitis than those individuals with healthy periodontium. 
After adjustments for age, gender, and body mass index, patients with severe 
periodontitis had a statistically significant association with impaired glucose 
metabolism (HbA1c ≥5.7) (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of 9.56; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 1.819-46.08; P < 0.01). Furthermore, patients with severe 
periodontitis had significantly greater odds to develop impaired fasting glucose 
(adjusted OR of 7.489, 95% CI: 1.408-39.839; P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The mean FBS, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in 
severe periodontitis patients than in the control group. A higher proportion of 
patients presented with prediabetes, incident diabetes, and insulin resistance 
in the severe periodontitis group.
