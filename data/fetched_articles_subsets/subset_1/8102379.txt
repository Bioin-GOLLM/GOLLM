We analyzed the DNA sequence of the cDNA encoding the NH2 terminal region of 
beta spectrin from members of a kindred with autosomal dominant hereditary 
spherocytosis associated with defective protein 4.1 binding. We found a point 
mutation at codon 202 within the 272 amino acid NH2-terminal region of beta 
spectrin. TGG was changed to CGG, resulting in the replacement of tryptophan by 
arginine. The base change eliminates a normally occurring PvuII restriction site 
and creates a new MspI site. This finding enabled rapid detection or exclusion 
of the mutation at the DNA level among the family members, including one member 
for whom this analysis was performed prenatally. The mutation was found only in 
the affected family members and occurred as a de novo mutation in the proband. 
It has not been found in 20 other kindreds. The recombinant peptide derived from 
the normal cDNA retains the capacity to sediment with protein 4.1 and F-actin. 
The mutant peptide spontaneously degrades. This variant represents both the 
first point mutation and the first beta spectrin mutation demonstrated in 
autosomal dominant hereditary spherocytosis. Furthermore, the mutation is 
located within a conserved sequence among spectrinlike proteins and may define 
an amino acid critical for protein 4.1 binding activity.
