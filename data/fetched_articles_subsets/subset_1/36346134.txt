Autoimmune neuropathy associated with antibodies against pan-neurofascin is a 
new subtype of nodo-paranodopathy. It is relevant because it is associated with 
high morbidity and mortality. Affected patients often require intensive care 
unit treatment for several months, and data on the reversibility and long-term 
prognosis are limited. The pathogenicity including IgG subclass-associated 
mechanisms has not been unravelled, nor directly compared to 
anti-neurofascin-155 IgG4-related pathology. Understanding the underlying 
pathology might have a direct impact on treatment of these severely affected 
patients. By a multicentre combined prospective and retrospective approach, we 
provide clinical data of a large cohort of patients with 
anti-neurofascin-associated neuropathy (n = 18) including longitudinal titre and 
neurofilament light chain assessment via Ella® and relate clinical data to in 
vitro pathogenicity studies of anti-neurofascin antibodies. We assessed antibody 
binding characteristics and the pathogenic effects of anti-pan-neurofascin 
versus neurofascin-155 antibodies on living myelinating dorsal root ganglia 
co-cultures. Additionally, we analysed the IgG subclass profile and the 
complement binding capacity and effector functions considering the effects of 
intravenous immunoglobulin preparations via enzyme-linked immunosorbent and 
cell-based assays. In contrast to chronic neurofascin-155 IgG4-associated 
neuropathy, anti-pan-neurofascin-associated disease presented with a high 
morbidity and mortality, but as a monophasic and potentially reversible 
disorder. During follow-up, antibodies were no longer detectable in 8 of 11 
patients. Anti-pan-neurofascin had direct access to the nodes of Ranvier in 
myelinating cultures titre-dependently, most probably inducing this severe 
phenotype. Antibody preincubation led to impaired paranode formation, 
destruction of paranodal architecture and alterations on paranodal myelin and 
sensory neurons in the cultures, with more severe effects than neurofascin-155 
antibodies. Besides IgG4, subclass IgG3 was detected and associated with 
complement binding and cytotoxic effects in vitro. As a possible correlate of 
axonal damage in vivo, we detected highly increased serum neurofilament light 
chain levels (sNF-L), correlating to serum C3a. Still, sNF-L was not identified 
as a marker for poor prognosis, but rather as an intra- and interindividual 
marker for acuteness, severity and course, with a strong decrease during 
recovery. Our data provide evidence that anti-pan-neurofascin antibodies 
directly attack the node and induce severe and acute, but potentially 
reversible, nodo-paranodal pathology, possibly involving complement-mediated 
mechanisms. Screening for autoantibodies thus is crucial to identify this subset 
of patients who benefit from early antibody-depleting therapy. Titre and sNF-L 
might serve as valuable follow-up parameters. The prospect of a favourable 
outcome has high relevance for physicians, patients and relatives during months 
of critical care.
