The transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles exhibits an unusual form of 
regulation by Cl- as well as an associated Cl- conductance. To distinguish 
direct effects of Cl- on the transporter from indirect effects via the driving 
force Δψ, we used whole endosome recording and report the first currents due to 
glutamate flux by the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs). Chloride 
allosterically activates the VGLUTs from both sides of the membrane, and we find 
that neutralization of an arginine in transmembrane domain four suffices for the 
lumenal activation. The dose dependence suggests that Cl- permeates through a 
channel and glutamate through a transporter. Competition between the anions 
nonetheless indicates that they use a similar permeation pathway. By controlling 
both ionic gradients and Δψ, endosome recording isolates different steps in the 
process of synaptic vesicle filling, suggesting distinct roles for Cl- in both 
allosteric activation and permeation.
