[Formula: see text]-Propeller proteins are common natural disc-like 
pseudo-symmetric proteins that contain multiple repeats ('blades') each 
consisting of a 4-stranded anti-parallel [Formula: see text]-sheet. So far, 4- 
to 12-bladed [Formula: see text]-propellers have been discovered in nature 
showing large functional and sequential variation. Using computational design 
approaches, we created perfectly symmetric [Formula: see text]-propellers out of 
natural pseudo-symmetric templates. These proteins are useful tools to study 
protein evolution of this very diverse fold. While the 7-bladed architecture is 
the most common, no symmetric 7-bladed monomer has been created and 
characterized so far. Here we describe such a engineered protein, based on a 
highly symmetric natural template, and test the effects of circular permutation 
on its stability. Geometrical analysis of this protein and other artificial 
symmetrical proteins reveals no systematic constraint that could be used to help 
in engineering of this fold, and suggests sequence constraints unique to each 
[Formula: see text]-propeller sub-family.
