Mammalian lipid homeostasis requires proteolytic activation of membrane-bound 
sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors through 
sequential action of the Golgi Site-1 and Site-2 proteases. Here we report that 
while SREBP function is conserved in fungi, fission yeast employs a different 
mechanism for SREBP cleavage. Using genetics and biochemistry, we identified 
four genes defective for SREBP cleavage, dsc1-4, encoding components of a 
transmembrane Golgi E3 ligase complex with structural homology to the Hrd1 E3 
ligase complex involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. The Dsc 
complex binds SREBP and cleavage requires components of the ubiquitin-proteasome 
pathway: the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc4, the Dsc1 RING E3 ligase, and the 
proteasome. dsc mutants display conserved aggravating genetic interactions with 
components of the multivesicular body pathway in fission yeast and budding 
yeast, which lacks SREBP. Together, these data suggest that the Golgi Dsc E3 
ligase complex functions in a post-ER pathway for protein degradation.
