During JADPRO Live Virtual 2021, three advanced practitioners-in surgery, 
radiation oncology, and medical oncology-discussed their collaboration in the 
management of resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. The presenters 
discussed the role of screening and early surgical resection, cancer

novel therapies and their associated toxicities.
