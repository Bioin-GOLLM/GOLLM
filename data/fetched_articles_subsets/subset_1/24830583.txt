Graves' disease (GD) is postulated to be caused by the combined effects of 
susceptibility genes and environmental triggers. Toll like receptors (TLRs) play 
a role in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses in mammalians. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential association of TLR4 and TLR5 
gene polymorphisms with GD in Chinese Cantonese population. Four single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs11536889 and rs7873784 in TLR4, rs2072493 and 
rs5744174 in TLR5, were evaluated in 332 GD patients and 351 unrelated controls 
from Chinese Cantonese population. The minor allele C of TLR5 rs5744174 
decreased the risk to GD in females (ORC vs. T=0.63; p=0.003; ptrend=0.003). 
Under a dominant model, rs5744174 conferred a protective effect in all cases 
(ORCC/CT vs. TT=0.65; p=0.009) or female subset (ORCC/CT vs. TT=0.57; p=0.002). 
Under a co-dominant model, rs5744174 also conferred a protective effect in all 
cases (ORTC vs. TT=0.64; p=0.008) and females (ORTC vs. TT=0.57; p=0.002). The 
haplotype A-C of TLR5 (rs2072493-rs5744174) decreased the risk of GD in females 
(OR=0.62; p=0.002). The other three SNPs were not found associated with GD. This 
study provided evidence that polymorphisms in TLR5 might be associated with 
decreased susceptibility of GD in females.
