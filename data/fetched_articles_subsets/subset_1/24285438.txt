INTRODUCTION: Earlier, we reported syntheses of 
ethyl-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1,4')-2'-deoxy-2'-[(18)F]fluoro-β-D-glucopyranoside 
(Et-[(18)F]FDL) and 1'-[(18)F]fluoroethyl-β-D-lactose ([(18)F]-FEL) for positron 
emission tomography (PET) of pancreatic carcinoma. Et-[(18)F]FDL requires a 
precursor, which involves 11 steps to synthesize and produces overall low 
yields. Synthesis of precursors for [(18)F]-FEL requires four steps, but those 
precursors produced low radiochemical yields. Here, we report new precursors and 
an improved synthesis of [(18)F]-FEL.
METHOD: Two precursors, 
1'-(methanesulfonyl)ethyl-2',3',6',2,3,4,6-hepta-O-acetyl-β-D-lactose 2a and 
1'-(p-nitrophenyl-sulfonyl)ethyl-2',3',6',2,3,4,6-hepta-O-acetyl-β-D-lactose 2b, 
were synthesized from lactose in four steps. Radiofluorination reactions were 
performed using K(18)F/kryptofix and the crude product [(18)F]-3 was purified by 
HPLC. Basic hydrolysis of [(18)F]-3 produced 1'-[(18)F]fluoroethyl-β-D-lactose 
[(18)F]-4, which was neutralized, diluted with saline, filtered on a 0.22-µm 
filter, and analyzed by radio-TLC.
RESULTS: The average radiochemical yields of [(18)F]-4 (d. c.) from 2a and 2b 
were 21% (n = 6) and 65% (n = 6), respectively, with >99% radiochemical purity 
and specific activity of 55.5 GBq/µmol. Synthesis time was 90-95 min from the 
end of bombardment.
CONCLUSION: An improved synthesis of [(18)F]FEL has been achieved in high 
yields, with high purity and specific activity. Precursor 2b with this method 
should be applicable for high yield automated production in a commercial 
synthesis module for clinical application.
