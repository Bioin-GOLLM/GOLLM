Saccades are rapid eye movements designed to shift the fovea to objects of 
visual interest. Abnormalities of saccades offer important clues in the 
diagnosis of a number of movement disorders. In this review, we explore the 
anatomy of horizontal and vertical saccades, discuss practical aspects of their 
examination, and review how saccadic abnormalities in hyperkinetic and 
hypokinetic movement disorders aid in diagnosis, with video demonstration of 
classic examples. Documentation of the ease of saccade initiation, range of 
motion and conjugacy of saccades, speed and accuracy of saccades, dynamic 
saccadic trajectory, and the presence or absence of saccadic intrusions and 
oscillations are important components of this exam. We also provide a practical 
algorithm to demonstrate the value of saccades in the differential diagnosis of 
the movement disorders patient.
