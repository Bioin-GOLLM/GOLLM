The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) can be stabilized by the 
introduction of a disulfide bond between the gp120 and gp41 subunits. The 
resulting protein is monomeric, but trimerization can be improved by the 
introduction of a single helix-breaking residue at the conserved Ile559 site in 
the N-terminal heptad repeat region of gp41. To provide more insight into how 
such a substitution in gp41 affects Env structure and function, we evaluated the 
effect on the wild-type Env in the context of replicating virus. The Ile559Gly 
and Ile559Pro mutations adversely affect Env biosynthesis and Env incorporation 
into virions. Biophysical studies show that the Ile559Pro mutation essentially 
disrupts the folding of a recombinant gp41 ectodomain core into a six-helix 
bundle structure. Viruses containing the Ile559Gly and Ile559Pro substitutions 
replicate poorly, but an evolutionary route is described that restores 
replication competence. In the escape virus, which contains a Pro559Leu 
first-site pseudoreversion, the local helical structure and, as a consequence, 
Env biosynthesis and function are restored.
