BACKGROUND: N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is elevated in 
gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. This trial aimed to generate data for 
gestational diabetes mellitus patients, who are at risk to develop these 
complications.
METHODS: We have measured NT-proBNP in 223 otherwise healthy women between 
gestational week 24 and 32 referred to the outpatient diabetes unit in a 
cross-sectional study.
RESULTS: 88 control subjects, 45 patients with indication for medical nutrition 
therapy (MNT) alone and 90 patients who required insulin therapy were included. 
Groups of women were comparable regarding gestational week. Body mass index 
before pregnancy and at blood draw was significantly higher in subjects with 
insulin dependent gestational diabetes mellitus compared to MNT controlled 
gestational diabetes mellitus. NT-proBNP was significantly lower in patients 
with insulin dependent gestational diabetes mellitus (35 ± 25 pg/ml) compared to 
controls (53 ± 43 pg/ml, p = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: NT-proBNP is within the reference range of normal subjects in women 
with gestational diabetes mellitus. Differences in body mass index, changes in 
glomerular filtration rate and haemodynamics may explain lower NT-proBNP 
concentrations in insulin dependent gestational diabetes mellitus. A false 
negative interpretation needs to be considered in these women.
