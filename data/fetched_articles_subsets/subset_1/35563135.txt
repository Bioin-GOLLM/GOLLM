The term Western diet (WD) describes the consumption of large amounts of highly 
processed foods, rich in simple sugars and saturated fats. Long-term WD feeding 
leads to insulin resistance, postulated as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). AD is the main cause of progressive dementia characterized by the 
deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of 
the hyperphosphorylated tau (p-Tau) protein in the brain, starting from the 
entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. In this study, we report that WD-derived 
impairment in insulin signaling induces tau and Aβ brain pathology in wild-type 
C57BL/6 mice, and that the entorhinal cortex is more sensitive than the 
hippocampus to the impairment of brain insulin signaling. In the brain areas 
developing WD-induced insulin resistance, we observed changes in p-Tau(Thr231) 
localization in neuronal subcellular compartments, indicating progressive 
tauopathy, and a decrease in amyloid precursor protein levels correlating with 
the appearance of Aβ peptides. These results suggest that WD promotes the 
development of AD and may be considered not only a risk factor, but also a 
modifiable trigger of AD.
