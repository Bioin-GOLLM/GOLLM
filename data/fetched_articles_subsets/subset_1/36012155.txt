Implants are essential therapeutic tools for treating bone fractures and joint 
replacements. Despite the in-depth study of osseointegration for more than fifty 
years, poor osseointegration caused by aseptic loosening remains one of the 
leading causes of late implant failures. Osseointegration is a highly 
sophisticated and spatiotemporal process in vivo involving the immune response, 
angiogenesis, and osteogenesis. It has been unraveled that the nervous system 
plays a pivotal role in skeletal health via manipulating neurotrophins, 
neuropeptides, and nerve cells. Herein, the research related to nervous 
system-driven osseointegration was systematically analyzed and reviewed, aiming 
to demonstrate the prominent role of neuromodulation in osseointegration. 
Additionally, it is indicated that the implant design considering the role of 
neuromodulation might be a promising way to prevent aseptic loosening.
