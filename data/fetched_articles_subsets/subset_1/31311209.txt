Candida species represent one of the most frequent causes of hospital-acquired 
infections in immunocompromised patient cohorts. Due to a very limited set of 
antifungals available and an increasing prevalence of drug resistance, the 
discovery of novel antifungal targets is essential. Targeting chromatin 
modifiers as potential antifungal targets has gained attention recently, mainly 
due to their role in regulating virulence in Candida species. Here, we describe 
a novel activity for the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor 
Cyclopentylidene-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)hydrazone (CPTH2) as a specific 
inhibitor of CTG clade Candida species. Furthermore, we show that CPTH2 has 
fungicidal activity and protects macrophages from Candida-mediated death. Thus, 
this work could provide a starting point for the development of novel 
antifungals specific to CTG clade Candida species.
