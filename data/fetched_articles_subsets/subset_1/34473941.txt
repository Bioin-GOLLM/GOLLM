Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a prime environmental stressor that our epidermis 
is exposed to on a daily basis. To avert UV-induced damage, epidermal stem cells 
(EpSCs) become pigmented via a process of heterotypic interaction between 
melanocytes and EpSCs; however, the molecular mechanisms of this interaction are 
not well understood. In this study, we show that the function of a key chromatin 
regulator, the Polycomb complex, was reduced upon UV exposure in human and mouse 
epidermis. Genetic ablation of key Polycomb subunits in murine EpSCs, mimicking 
depletion upon UV exposure, results in an increased number of epidermal 
melanocytes and subsequent epidermal pigmentation. Genome-wide transcriptional 
and chromatin studies show that Polycomb regulates the expression of 
UV-responsive genes and identifies type II collagen (COL2A1) as a critical 
secreted regulator of melanogenesis and epidermal pigmentation. Together, our 
findings show how UV exposure induces Polycomb-mediated changes in EpSCs to 
affect melanocyte behavior and promote epidermal pigmentation.
