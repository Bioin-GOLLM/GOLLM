BACKGROUND: Invadopodia are actin-based cell-membrane protrusions associated 
with the extracellular matrix degradation accompanying cancer invasion. The 
elucidation of the molecular mechanisms leading to invadopodia formation and 
activity is central for the prevention of tumor spreading and growth. Protein 
tyrosine kinases such as Src are known to regulate invadopodia assembly, little 
is however known on the role of protein tyrosine phosphatases in this process. 
Among these enzymes, we have selected the tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 to 
investigate its potential role in invadopodia assembly, due to its involvement 
in cancer development.
METHODS: Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies were employed to 
identify novel substrate/s of Shp1AQ controlling invadopodia activity. The 
phosphorylation level of cortactin, the Shp1 substrate identified in this study, 
was assessed by immunoprecipitation, in vitro phosphatase and western blot 
assays. Short interference RNA and a catalytically-dead mutant of Shp1 expressed 
in A375MM melanoma cells were used to evaluate the role of the specific 
Shp1-mediated dephosphorylation of cortactin. The anti-invasive proprieties of 
glycerophosphoinositol, that directly binds and regulates Shp1, were 
investigated by extracellular matrix degradation assays and in vivo mouse model 
of metastasis.
RESULTS: The data show that Shp1 was recruited to invadopodia and promoted the 
dephosphorylation of cortactin at tyrosine 421, leading to an attenuated 
capacity of melanoma cancer cells to degrade the extracellular matrix. Controls 
included the use of short interference RNA and catalytically-dead mutant that 
prevented the dephosphorylation of cortactin and hence the decrease the 
extracellular matrix degradation by melanoma cells. In addition, the 
phosphoinositide metabolite glycerophosphoinositol facilitated the localization 
of Shp1 at invadopodia hence promoting cortactin dephosphorylation. This 
impaired invadopodia function and tumor dissemination both in vitro and in an in 
vivo model of melanomas.
CONCLUSION: The main finding here reported is that cortactin is a specific 
substrate of the tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 and that its 
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation affects invadopodia formation and, as a 
consequence, the ability of melanoma cells to invade the extracellular matrix. 
Shp1 can thus be considered as a regulator of melanoma cell invasiveness and a 
potential target for antimetastatic drugs. Video abstract.
