BACKGROUND: Hydrops fetalis, a pathological fluid accumulation in two or more 
body compartments, is aetiologically heterogeneous. We investigated a 
consanguineous family with recurrent pregnancy loss due to severe early-onset 
non-immune hydrops fetalis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole exome sequencing in four fetuses with hydrops fetalis 
revealed that they were homozygous for the angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) variant Chr8 
(GRCh37/Hg19): 6385085T>C, NM_001147.2:c.557A>G. The substitution introduces a 
cryptic, exonic splice site predicted to result in loss of 10 nucleotides with 
subsequent shift in reading frame, leading to a premature stop codon. RNA 
analysis in the heterozygous parents demonstrated loss of detectable mutant 
allele, indicative of loss-of-function via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Serum 
ANGPT2 levels were reduced in the parents. In a pregnancy with a healthy, 
heterozygous child, transiently increased fetal nuchal translucency was noted.
CONCLUSION: Pathogenic heterozygous ANGPT2 missense variants were recently shown 
to cause autosomal dominant primary lymphoedema. ANGPT2 is a ligand of the 
TIE1-TIE2 (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and epidermal growth 
factor-like domains 1 and 2) pathway. It is critical to the formation and 
remodelling of blood and lymphatic vessels and is involved in vessel 
maintenance. ANGPT2 knockout mice die from generalised lymphatic dysfunction. We 
show here that a homozygous pathogenic variant causes loss-of-function and 
results in severe early-onset hydrops fetalis. This is the first report of an 
autosomal recessive ANGPT2-related disorder in humans.
