KK obese mice exhibit a multigenic syndrome of moderate obesity, 
hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. Here we show that the syndrome is 
accompanied by a marked elevation of leptin protein in adipose tissue, as well 
as leptin levels in serum, which corresponds with the degree of obesity. The 
cDNA sequence of leptin is normal in KK mice, whereas three nucleotide 
polymorphisms were found in the cDNA of the leptin receptor, one of them 
resulting in exchange of an aspartate residue for asparagine (Asp600Asn) in a 
highly conserved part of the second extracellular cytokine-receptor homology 
module. In female (but not male) F2 mice of a C57BL/6JxKK intercross, the weight 
of gonadal, retroperitoneal and mesenteric adipose tissue was positively 
correlated with the number of alleles inherited from the KK parental strain at a 
microsatellite marker (D4Mit175) which maps close (0.7 centimorgan proximal) to 
the leptin receptor gene. It is suggested that the Asp600Asn leptin receptor 
variant contributes to the obesity syndrome in KK female mice, but that its 
contribution is only a part of the multigenic syndrome.
