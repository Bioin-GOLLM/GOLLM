During vertebrate heart development, two progenitor populations, first and 
second heart fields (FHF, SHF), sequentially contribute to longitudinal 
subdivisions of the heart tube (HT), with the FHF contributing the left 
ventricle and part of the atria, and the SHF the rest of the heart. Here, we 
study the dynamics of cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis by tracking 
individual cells in live analysis of mouse embryos. We report that during an 
initial phase, FHF precursors differentiate rapidly to form a cardiac crescent, 
while limited morphogenesis takes place. In a second phase, no differentiation 
occurs while extensive morphogenesis, including splanchnic mesoderm sliding over 
the endoderm, results in HT formation. In a third phase, cardiac precursor 
differentiation resumes and contributes to SHF-derived regions and the dorsal 
closure of the HT. These results reveal tissue-level coordination between 
morphogenesis and differentiation during HT formation and provide a new 
framework to understand heart development.
