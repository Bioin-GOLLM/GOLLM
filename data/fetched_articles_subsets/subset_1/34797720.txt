How DNA damage leads to chronic inflammation and tissue degeneration with aging 
remains to be fully resolved. Here, we show that DNA damage leads to cellular 
senescence, fibrosis, loss-of-tissue architecture, and chronic pancreatitis in 
mice with an inborn defect in the excision repair cross complementation group 1 
(Ercc1) gene. We find that DNA damage-driven R-loops causally contribute to the 
active release and buildup of single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in the cytoplasm of 
cells triggering a viral-like immune response in progeroid and naturally aged 
pancreata. To reduce the proinflammatory load, we developed an extracellular 
vesicle (EV)-based strategy to deliver recombinant S1 or ribonuclease H 
nucleases in inflamed Ercc1−/− pancreatic cells. Treatment of Ercc1−/− animals 
with the EV-delivered nuclease cargo eliminates DNA damage-induced R-loops and 
cytoplasmic ssDNAs alleviating chronic inflammation. Thus, DNA damage-driven 
ssDNAs causally contribute to tissue degeneration, Ercc1−/− paving the way for 
novel rationalized intervention strategies against age-related chronic 
inflammation.
