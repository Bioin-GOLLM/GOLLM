The discovery and characterization of the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas immune system 
has led to a revolution in genome editing and engineering technologies. Despite 
the fact that most applications emerged after the discovery of the type II-A 
CRISPR-Cas9 system of Streptococcus pyogenes, its biological importance in this 
organism has received little attention. Here, we provide a comprehensive 
overview of the current knowledge about CRISPR-Cas systems from S. pyogenes. We 
discuss how the interplay between CRISPR-mediated immunity and horizontal gene 
transfer might have modeled the evolution of this pathogen. We review the 
current literature about the CRISPR-Cas systems present in S. pyogenes (types 
I-C and II-A), and describe their distinctive biochemical and functional 
features. Finally, we summarize the main biotechnological applications that have 
arisen from the discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in S. pyogenes.
