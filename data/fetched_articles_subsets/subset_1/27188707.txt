OBJECTIVE: Spasmodic dysphonia is a focal dystonia of the larynx with 
heterogeneous manifestations and association with familial risk factors. There 
are scarce data to allow precise understanding of etiology and pathophysiology. 
Screening for dystonia-causing genetic mutations has the potential to allow 
accurate diagnosis, inform about genotype-phenotype correlations, and allow a 
better understanding of mechanisms of disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients presenting with spasmodic dysphonia 
to the voice clinic of our academic medical center. Data included demographics, 
clinical features, family history, and treatments administered. The following 
genes with disease-causing mutations previously associated with spasmodic 
dysphonia were screened: TOR1A (DYT1), TUBB4 (DYT4), and THAP1 (DYT6).
RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were recruited, comprising 77% females and 23% 
males. A definite family history of neurologic disorder was present in 15% (13 
of 86). Average age (± standard deviation) of symptom onset was 42.1 ± 15.7 
years. Most (99%; 85 of 86) were treated with botulinum toxin, and 12% (11 of 
86) received oral medications. Genetic screening was negative in all patients 
for the GAG deletion in TOR1A (DYT1) and in the 5 exons currently associated 
with disease-causing mutations in TUBB4 (DYT4). Two patients tested positive for 
novel/rare variants in THAP1 (DYT6).
CONCLUSION: Genetic screening targeted at currently known disease-causing 
mutations in TOR1A, THAP1, and TUBB4 appears to have low diagnostic yield in 
sporadic spasmodic dysphonia. In our cohort, only 2 patients tested positive for 
novel/rare variants in THAP1. Clinicians should make use of genetic testing 
judiciously and in cost-effective ways.
