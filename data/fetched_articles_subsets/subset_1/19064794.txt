Cellular elements of the neurovascular unit are essential for the physiological 
functioning of brain vessels. If any of these vascular elements are disturbed 
the consequences can be dire. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a disorder 
caused by the accumulation of amyloid in cerebral vessels, provides a case study 
of progressive neurovascular unit dysfunction leading to failure of vascular 
reactivity, smooth muscle cell loss, and eventual frank breakdown of vessel 
integrity resulting in recurrent and sometimes fatal intracerebral hemorrhage.
