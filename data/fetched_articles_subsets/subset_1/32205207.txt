Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most 
important porcine viruses worldwide. Recently, severe PRRS outbreaks had 
occurred in two farms located in eastern and southern Thailand where stringent 
vaccination had been routinely practiced. Genetic analysis of GP5 identified two 
highly virulent PRRSVs designated as NA/TH/S001/2015 and NA/TH/E001/2016 from 
the southern and eastern farms, respectively. Both incidences were the first 
outbreaks of severe PRRSV since the implementation of the modified live virus 
(MLV) vaccine, indicating the concurrent emergence of immune-escape viruses. The 
genetics of the two PRRSV variants, the previous studied sequences from 
Thailand, and the reference strains were characterized with a focus on the GP5 
and NSP2 genes. The results indicated that NA/TH/S001/2015 and NA/TH/E001/2016 
shared less than 87% nucleotide similarity to the MLV and PRRSV type 2, lineages 
1 and 8.7 (NA), respectively. A comparative analysis of the retrospective GP5 
sequences categorized the PRRSVs into five groups based on the clinical 
outcomes, and both of the novel PRRSV strains were in the same group. Epitope A, 
T cell epitope, and N-linked glycosylation patterns within GP5 of both PRRSV 
variants were highly variable and significantly differed from those of MLV. As 
observed in highly virulent type 2 strains, NA/TH/S001/2015 contained a single 
amino acid deletion at position 33 in the hypervariable region 1 (HV-1) of GP5. 
Amino acid analysis of the hypervariable region of NSP2 revealed that 
NA/TH/E001/2016 had a unique deletion pattern that included two discontinuous 
deletions: a 127-amino acid deletion from residues 301 to 427 and a single amino 
acid deletion at position 470. These results indicate the emergence of two novel 
PRRSV strains and highlight the common genetic characteristics of the 
immune-escaping PRRSV variants.
