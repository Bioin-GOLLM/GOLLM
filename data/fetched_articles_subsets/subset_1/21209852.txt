BACKGROUND: Enhanced motility of cancer cells is a critical step in promoting 
tumor metastasis. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), representing the major mitogenic 
activity in serum, stimulates migration in various types of cancer cells. 
However, the underlying signaling mechanisms for LPA-induced motility of cancer 
cells remain to be elucidated.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we found that LPA 
dose-dependently stimulated migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, with 10 
ÂµM being the most effective. LPA also increased ERK activity and the MEK 
inhibitor U0126 could block LPA-induced ERK activity and cell migration. In 
addition, LPA induced PAK1 activation while ERK activation and cell migration 
were inhibited by ectopic expression of an inactive mutant form of PAK1 in 
MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, LPA increased PI3K activity, and the PI3K 
inhibitor LY294002 inhibited both LPA-induced PAK1/ERK activation and cell 
migration. Moreover, in the breast cancer cell, LPA treatment resulted in 
remarkable production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while LPA-induced ROS 
generation, PI3K/PAK1/ERK activation and cell migration could be inhibited by 
N-acetyl-L-Cysteine, a scavenger of ROS.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, this study identifies a PI3K/PAK1/ERK 
signaling pathway for LPA-stimulated breast cancer cell migration. These data 
also suggest that ROS generation plays an essential role in the activation of 
LPA-stimulated PI3K/PAK1/ERK signaling and breast cancer cell migration. These 
findings may provide a basis for designing future therapeutic strategy for 
blocking breast cancer metastasis.
