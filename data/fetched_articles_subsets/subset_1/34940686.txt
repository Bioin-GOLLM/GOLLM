Lectins are proteins with a remarkably high affinity and specificity for 
carbohydrates. Many organisms naturally produce them, including animals, plants, 
fungi, protists, bacteria, archaea, and viruses. The present report focuses on 
lectins produced by marine or freshwater organisms, in particular algae and 
cyanobacteria. We explore their structure, function, classification, and 
antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, we look at the expression of lectins in 
heterologous systems and the current research on the preclinical and clinical 
evaluation of these fascinating molecules. The further development of these 
molecules might positively impact human health, particularly the prevention or 
treatment of diseases caused by pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus, 
influenza, and severe acute respiratory coronaviruses, among others.
