The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is a DNA damage response (DDR) factor that 
promotes monoubiquitination of H2A/H2AX at K13/15, facilitates recruitment of 
other DDR factors (e.g. 53BP1) to DNA damage, and inhibits homologous 
recombination (HR) in cells deficient in the tumor suppressor BRCA1. We have 
examined the domains of RNF168 important for these DDR events, including 
chromosomal HR that is induced by several nucleases (I-SceI, CAS9-WT and 
CAS9-D10A), since the inducing nuclease affects the relative frequency of 
distinct repair outcomes. We found that an N-terminal fragment of RNF168 
(1-220/N221*) efficiently inhibits HR induced by each of these nucleases in 
BRCA1 depleted cells, and promotes recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA damage and H2AX 
monoubiquitination at K13/15. Each of these DDR events requires a charged 
residue in RNF168 (R57). Notably, RNF168-N221* fails to self-accumulate into 
ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF). Furthermore, expression of RNF168 WT and 
N221* can significantly bypass the role of another E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF8, 
for inhibition of HR in BRCA1 depleted cells, and for promotion of 53BP1 IRIF. 
We suggest that the ability for RNF168 to promote H2A/H2AX monoubiquitination 
and 53BP1 IRIF, but not RNF168 self-accumulation into IRIF, is important for 
inhibition of HR in BRCA1 deficient cells.
