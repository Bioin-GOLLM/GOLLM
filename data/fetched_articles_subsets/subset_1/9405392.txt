The catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase requires two distinct 
surfaces to form a stable complex with its physiological inhibitors, the 
regulatory (R) subunits and the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitors. In 
addition to a substrate-like segment that is common to both inhibitors, R 
requires a peripheral recognition site, PRS2. This surface is comprised of the 
essential phosphorylation site, Thr-197, His-87, Trp-196, and several 
surrounding basic residues. To probe the role of Trp-196 in the recognition of 
R, Trp-196 was replaced with Arg and Ala. Although both rC(W196A) and rC(W196R) 
were inhibited readily with cAMP-free R, they failed to form an inhibited 
holoenzyme complex with native R under conditions in which wild-type holoenzyme 
formed readily. Pairing rC(W196R) with mutant forms of R lacking domain B or 
having defects in cAMP binding sites A or B highlighted the importance of the 
conformation of R, and, in particular, the accessibility of site A. One of these 
mutants, rR(R333K), having a defect in cAMP binding site B formed a stable 
complex with rC(W196R) in the absence of cAMP. However, unlike wild-type 
holoenzyme, this complex was active.
