Efferocytosis is the effective clearance of apoptotic cells by professional and 
non-professional phagocytes. The process is mechanically different from other 
forms of phagocytosis and involves the localization, binding, internalization, 
and degradation of apoptotic cells. Defective efferocytosis has been 
demonstrated to associate with the pathogenesis of various inflammatory 
disorders. In the current review, we summarize recent findings with regard to 
efferocytosis networks and discuss the relationship between efferocytosis and 
different immune cell populations, as well as describe how efferocytosis helps 
resolve inflammatory response and modulate immune balance. Our knowledge so far 
about efferocytosis suggests that it may be a useful target in the treatment of 
numerous inflammatory diseases.
