Individuals with the neuropsychiatric disorder mania exhibit hyperactivity, 
elevated mood, and a decreased need for sleep. The brain areas and neuronal 
populations involved in mania-like behaviors, however, have not been elucidated. 
In this study, we found that ablating the ventral medial midbrain/pons (VMP) 
GABAergic neurons induced mania-like behaviors in mice, including hyperactivity, 
anti-depressive behaviors, reduced anxiety, increased risk-taking behaviors, 
distractibility, and an extremely shortened sleep time. Strikingly, these mice 
also showed no rebound sleep after sleep deprivation, suggesting abnormal sleep 
homeostatic regulation. Dopamine D2 receptor deficiency largely abolished the 
sleep reduction induced by ablating the VMP GABAergic neurons without affecting 
the hyperactivity and anti-depressive behaviors. Our data demonstrate that VMP 
GABAergic neurons are involved in the expression of mania-like behaviors, which 
can be segregated to the short-sleep and other phenotypes on the basis of the 
dopamine D2 receptors.
