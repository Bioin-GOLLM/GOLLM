OBJECTIVE: With rising obesity, it is becoming increasingly difficult to 
distinguish between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in young 
adults. There has been substantial recent progress in identifying the 
contribution of common genetic variants to T1D and T2D. We aimed to determine 
whether a score generated from common genetic variants could be used to 
discriminate between T1D and T2D and also to predict severe insulin deficiency 
in young adults with diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed genetic risk scores (GRSs) from 
published T1D- and T2D-associated variants. We first tested whether the scores 
could distinguish clinically defined T1D and T2D from the Wellcome Trust Case 
Control Consortium (WTCCC) (n = 3,887). We then assessed whether the T1D GRS 
correctly classified young adults (diagnosed at 20-40 years of age, the 
age-group with the most diagnostic difficulty in clinical practice; n = 223) who 
progressed to severe insulin deficiency <3 years from diagnosis.
RESULTS: In the WTCCC, the T1D GRS, based on 30 T1D-associated risk variants, 
was highly discriminative of T1D and T2D (area under the curve [AUC] 0.88 [95% 
CI 0.87-0.89]; P < 0.0001), and the T2D GRS added little discrimination (AUC 
0.89). A T1D GRS >0.280 (>50th centile in those with T1D) is indicative of T1D 
(50% sensitivity, 95% specificity). A low T1D GRS (<0.234, <5th centile T1D) is 
indicative of T2D (53% sensitivity, 95% specificity). Most discriminative 
ability was obtained from just nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (AUC 0.87). 
In young adults with diabetes, T1D GRS alone predicted progression to insulin 
deficiency (AUC 0.87 [95% CI 0.82-0.92]; P < 0.0001). T1D GRS, autoantibody 
status, and clinical features were independent and additive predictors of severe 
insulin deficiency (combined AUC 0.96 [95% CI 0.94-0.99]; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: A T1D GRS can accurately identify young adults with diabetes who 
will require insulin treatment. This will be an important addition to correctly 
classifying individuals with diabetes when clinical features and autoimmune 
markers are equivocal.
