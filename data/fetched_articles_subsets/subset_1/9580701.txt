A 40 amino acid region of Oct-2 from amino acids 142 to 181 functions as an 
active repressor domain capable of inhibiting both basal activity and activation 
of promoters containing a TATA box, but not of those that contain an initiator 
element. Based on our observation that the equivalent region of the closely 
related Oct-1 factor does not act as an inhibitory domain, we have mutated 
specific residues in the Oct-2 domain in an attempt to probe their importance in 
repressor domain function. Although mutations of several residues have no or 
minimal effect, mutation of proline 175 to arginine abolishes the ability to 
inhibit both basal and activated transcription. In contrast, mutation of proline 
174 to arginine confers upon the domain the ability to repress activation of an 
initiator-containing promoter by acidic activation domains, and also suppresses 
the effect of the proline 175 mutation. Hence, adjacent proline residues play 
key roles in the functioning of the inhibitory domain and in limiting its 
specificity to TATA-box-containing promoters.
