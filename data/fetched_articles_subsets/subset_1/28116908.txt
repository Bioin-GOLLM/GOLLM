The T790 M mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is the 
most common mechanism underlying resistance to first- or second-generation EGFR 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, shows robust clinical 
efficacy in patients with T790 M-mutated lung cancer. Areas covered: We analyzed 
and reviewed clinical data for which patients who experienced acquired 
resistance to first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs. In addition, we briefly 
reviewed the potential role of osimertinib as a first-line therapy. Expert 
opinion: Osimertinib was recently licensed for use in NSCLC patients with 
acquired resistance to other EGFR TKIs due to a T790 M mutation. However, 
unresolved issues surrounding the optimal application of osimertinib remain, 
specifically the development of a plasma-based mutation test to overcome the 
difficulty of repeat biopsy, the efficacy of osimertinib for brain or 
leptomeningeal metastases, the development of resistance to osimertinib, and the 
use of osimertinib therapy as a first-line treatment. Many ongoing studies are 
currently exploring these issues.
