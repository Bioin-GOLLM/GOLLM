As expansions of CGG short tandem repeats (STRs) are established as the genetic 
etiology of many neurodevelopmental disorders, we aimed to elucidate the 
inheritance patterns and role of CGG STRs in autism-spectrum disorder (ASD). By 
genotyping 6063 CGG STR loci in a large cohort of trios and quads with an 
ASD-affected proband, we determined an unprecedented rate of CGG repeat length 
deviation across a single generation. Although the concept of repeat length 
being linked to deviation rate was solidified, we show how shorter STRs display 
greater degrees of size variation. We observed that CGG STRs did not segregate 
by Mendelian principles but with a bias against longer repeats, which appeared 
to magnify as repeat length increased. Through logistic regression, we 
identified 19 genes that displayed significantly higher rates and degrees of CGG 
STR expansion within the ASD-affected probands (P < 1 × 10-5). This study not 
only highlights novel repeat expansions that may play a role in ASD but also 
reinforces the hypothesis that CGG STRs are specifically linked to human 
cognition.
