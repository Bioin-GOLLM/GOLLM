BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore potential associations between single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 
(XRCC1) and cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1-like (CLPTM1L) and 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) susceptibility in non-smoker Chinese 
patients.
METHODS: A total of 200 NSCLC patients and 200 healthy controls with matched age 
and gender were recruited for genotyping of XRCC1 SNPs (rs2256507 and rs1001581) 
and CLPTM1L SNPs (rs401681 and rs4975616). Association of these SNPs with NSCLC 
risk was evaluated by computing the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval 
(CI) from multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses with 
adjustment for gender and age.
RESULTS: The frequencies of genotype and allele in these four loci (rs2256507, 
rs1001581, rs401681, and rs4975616) were not significantly different between the 
cases and controls, or between either of the histological subgroups 
(adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Although these SNPs are associated with NSCLC risk in patients with 
a tobacco-smoking habit, this study demonstrated that XRCC1 and CLPTM1L gene 
SPNs are not linked with NSCLC risk in non-smoking patients, indicating that 
molecular mechanisms of NSCLC betwee tobacco smokers and non-smokers may be 
different. Future studies are needed to uncover the underlying molecular 
mechanisms for NSCLC in non-smokers.
