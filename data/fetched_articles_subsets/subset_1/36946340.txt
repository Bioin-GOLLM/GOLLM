Background: The presence of polymorphisms in the TPMT gene is associated with 
adverse effects in patients treated with standard doses of thiopurine drugs. 
Scientific evidence recognizes significant ethnic differences in their 
frequencies and how their early identification can prevent clinical 
complications. Methods: 150 healthy residents of Aragua, Venezuela were 
enrolled. The SNPs c.460G>A and c.719A>G were detected by PCR-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism assay and c.238G>C by allele-specific PCR. Results: 
All genotype polymorphisms were heterozygous. TPMT*1/*3A, TPMT*1/*3C and 
TPMT*1/*2 genotypes were found in 4.0, 2.0 and 0.7%, respectively. Conclusion: 
6.7% of individuals have an intermediate TPMT activity. These findings support 
the importance of prior genotyping of TPMT in Venezuelan patients who require 
thiopurine drug therapy.
