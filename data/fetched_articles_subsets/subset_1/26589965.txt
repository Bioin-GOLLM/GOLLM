Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) is a key transcription 
factor that regulates genes involved in the de novo lipid synthesis and 
glycolysis pathways. The structure, turnover and transactivation potential of 
SREBP-1c are regulated by macronutrients and hormones via a cascade of 
signalling kinases. Using MS, we have identified serine 73 as a novel glycogen 
synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) phosphorylation site in the rat SREBP-1c purified from 
McA-RH7777 hepatoma cells. Our site-specific mutagenesis strategy revealed that 
the turnover of SREBP-1c, containing wild type, phospho-null (serine to alanine) 
or phospho-mimetic (serine to aspartic acid) substitutions, was differentially 
regulated. We show that the S73D mutant of pSREBP-1c, that mimicked a state of 
constitutive phosphorylation, dissociated from the SREBP-1c-SCAP complex more 
readily and underwent GSK-3-dependent proteasomal degradation via SCF(Fbw7) 
ubiquitin ligase pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3 or knockdown of 
GSK-3 by siRNA prevented accelerated degradation of SREBP-1c. As demonstrated by 
MS, SREBP-1c was phosphorylated in vitro by GSK-3β at serine 73. Phosphorylation 
of serine 73 also occurs in the intact liver. We propose that GSK-3-mediated 
phosphorylation of serine 73 in the rat SREBP-1c and its concomitant 
destabilization represents a novel mechanism involved in the inhibition of de 
novo lipid synthesis in the liver.
