Aberrant nucleic acids generated during viral replication are the main trigger 
for antiviral immunity, and mutations that disrupt nucleic acid metabolism can 
lead to autoinflammatory disorders. Here we investigated the etiology of 
X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder (XLPDR), a primary immunodeficiency with 
autoinflammatory features. We discovered that XLPDR is caused by an intronic 
mutation that disrupts the expression of POLA1, which encodes the catalytic 
subunit of DNA polymerase-α. Unexpectedly, POLA1 deficiency resulted in 
increased production of type I interferons. This enzyme is necessary for the 
synthesis of RNA:DNA primers during DNA replication and, strikingly, we found 
that POLA1 is also required for the synthesis of cytosolic RNA:DNA, which 
directly modulates interferon activation. Together this work identifies POLA1 as 
a critical regulator of the type I interferon response.
