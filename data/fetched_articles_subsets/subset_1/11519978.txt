In 1956 Rolf Kostmann reported on six children with severe neutropenia 
associated with a block in myelopoiesis at the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage and 
an autosomal recessive inheritance. He named the new syndrome infantile genetic 
agranulocytosis. Today it is known as Kostmann's syndrome or severe congenital 
neutropenia. In 1975 an additional 10 cases from northern Sweden were published. 
This article reports on the only long-term survivor from the 1975 report plus 
another five patients born after 1975 who belong to the original "Kostmann 
family". Treatment and survival have changed dramatically since Kostmann's first 
publication. In the pre-antibiotic era, Kostmann's syndrome was inevitably fatal 
during the first year of life.
CONCLUSION: Since the introduction of recombinant human granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) about 10 y ago, most patients now enjoy a 
normal life span and a greatly improved quality of life. Although the threat of 
death has disappeared, patients still have problems with infections, especially 
chronic gingivitis and periodontitis. In other groups of severe neutropenia, not 
related to the original "Kostmann family", an increased incidence of myeloid 
leukaemia has been observed. However, in this small cohort none of the children 
on chronic G-CSF therapy have developed malignancies.
