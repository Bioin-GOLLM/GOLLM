Histopathological level imaging in a non-invasive manner is important for 
clinical diagnosis, which has been a tremendous challenge for current imaging 
modalities. Recent development of ultra-high-field (UHF) magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) represents a large step toward this goal. Nevertheless, there is a 
lack of proper contrast agents that can provide superior imaging sensitivity at 
UHF for disease detection, because conventional contrast agents generally induce 
T2 decaying effects that are too strong and thus limit the imaging performance. 
Herein, by rationally engineering the size, spin alignment, and magnetic moment 
of the nanoparticles, we develop an UHF MRI-tailored ultra-sensitive 
antiferromagnetic nanoparticle probe (AFNP), which possesses exceptionally small 
magnetisation to minimize T2 decaying effect. Under the applied magnetic field 
of 9 T with mice dedicated hardware, the nanoprobe exhibits the ultralow r2/r1 
value (~1.93), enabling the sensitive detection of microscopic primary tumours 
(<0.60 mm) and micrometastases (down to 0.20 mm) in mice. The sensitivity and 
accuracy of AFNP-enhanced UHF MRI are comparable to those of the 
histopathological examination, enabling the development of non-invasive 
visualization of previously undetectable biological entities critical to medical 
diagnosis and therapy.
