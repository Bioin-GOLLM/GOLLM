CONTEXT: Pancreatic masses are routinely encountered on imaging and often 
present as a diagnostic dilemma. These masses range from benign inflammatory 
masses, requiring no intervention to malignant masses, which carry grave 
prognosis and hence require aggressive management.
AIMS: Compare the diagnostic accuracy of 256 multislice CT and endoscopic 
ultrasound (EUS) in characterization and assessment of resectability of 
pancreatic masses and compare the multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and 
EUS findings with histopathological findings.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Prospective study.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 36 patients with pancreatic masses were included who 
underwent dual phase CT using pancreatic protocol and EUS using 5-13 MHz 
transducer. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was done wherever feasible. 
Parameters regarding tumor size, location, imaging morphology, and vessel 
involvement were recorded. Findings were compared with 
histopathological/operative diagnosis/clinical follow-up.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Descriptive statistics with percentages and 
proportions and Chi-square test.
RESULTS: Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and EUS established diagnosis 
consistent with tissue diagnosis in 30 (83%) and 22 (61%) patients, 
respectively. However, the best results were obtained with the combined use of 
MDCT and EUS. The number of patients categorized as inconclusive by MDCT were 
lower compared to EUS. Assessing resectability for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 
MDCT showed specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% compared to 
EUS, which had specificity and PPV of 75% and 92.3%, respectively. MDCT is the 
first-line imaging modality in detection, characterization of pancreatic masses, 
and assessment of resectability in malignant neoplasms. EUS is beneficial in the 
detection of masses <2 cm in size causing pancreatic contour deformity on CT, 
for guiding FNAC. MDCT and EUS with EUS-guided FNA are complementary not 
competitive tools in preoperative imaging of pancreatic masses.
