Pathogenic variants in the MBTPS1 gene encoding the Site 1 protease have been 
described so far only in one growth retarded patients with skeletal deformities, 
large ears, a triangular face reminiscent to Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), and 
elevated blood lysosomal enzymes. We now report on the identification of a 
second adult patient homozygous for one of the two published pathogenic MBTPS1 
variants (p.Asp365Gly) by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), and a comparable 
phenotype. With this case, the association of pathogenic variants in MBTPS1 with 
a recognizable disorder could be confirmed, and the autosomal recessive 
inheritance is further established. As the variant was identified after a long 
diagnostic odyssey of the family, this example illustrates the need to apply WES 
in the diagnostic workup in case of growth retardation as early as possible. By 
compiling the clinical data of this new patient with those of the already 
reported patient, a better prognosis for future patients with MBTPS1 variants 
can be issued, and clinical management can be adjusted.
