BACKGROUND: Thalassemias (Thal) are forms of inherited autosomal recessive blood 
disorders arising out of mutations in the chromosomes 11 or 16. These disorders 
lead to poor oxygen delivery to blood vessels and consequent splenomegaly, bone 
deformities, and shorter life spans. The most common detection methods for Thal 
are complete blood count (CBC) followed by electrophoresis and molecular 
diagnosis methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping. These methods involve sophisticated 
instrumentations and are cumbersome and expensive.
RESULTS: In this study an innovative spectral detection method, based on the 
fluorescence spectra of a set of biomolecules (tyrosine, tryptophan, 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and flavin adenine dinucleotide and 
porphyrins) found in blood components is presented. An algorithm based on the 
spectral features of such biomolecules of blood components of 20 Thal patients 
(10 female and 10 male) and 18 age adjusted normal controls (4 female and 14 
male) demonstrate reasonable level of classification with sensitivity and 
specificity values exceeding 90%.
CONCLUSION: This new technique could be of significant value for Thal detection, 
diagnosis, and subsequent genetic counselling and could be adapted for use in 
small primary health centres.
