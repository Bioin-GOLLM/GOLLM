Leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) mutations are a common cause of Parkinson's 
disease. Here we identify inhibitors of LRRK2 kinase that are protective in in 
vitro and in vivo models of LRRK2-induced neurodegeneration. These results 
establish that LRRK2-induced degeneration of neurons in vivo is kinase dependent 
and that LRRK2 kinase inhibition provides a potential new neuroprotective 
paradigm for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
