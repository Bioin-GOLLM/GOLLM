Activity-induced changes in adhesion molecules may coordinate presynaptic and 
postsynaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that beta-catenin, which mediates 
interactions between cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton, moves from dendritic 
shafts into spines upon depolarization, increasing its association with 
cadherins. beta-catenin's redistribution was mimicked or prevented by a tyrosine 
kinase or phosphatase inhibitor, respectively. Point mutations of beta-catenin's 
tyrosine 654 altered the shaft/spine distribution: Y654F-beta-catenin-GFP 
(phosphorylation-prevented) was concentrated in spines, whereas 
Y654E-beta-catenin-GFP (phosphorylation-mimic) accumulated in dendritic shafts. 
In Y654F-expressing neurons, the PSD-95 or associated synapsin-I clusters were 
larger than those observed in either wild-type-beta-catenin or also 
Y654E-expressing neurons. Y654F-expressing neurons exhibited a higher 
minifrequency. Thus, neural activity induces beta-catenin's redistribution into 
spines, where it interacts with cadherin to influence synaptic size and 
strength.
