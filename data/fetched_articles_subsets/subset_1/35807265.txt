Adenosine mediates various physiological activities in the body. Adenosine 
receptors (ARs) are widely expressed in tumors and the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), and they induce tumor proliferation and suppress immune cell function. 
There are four types of human adenosine receptor (hARs): hA1, hA2A, hA2B, and 
hA3. Both hA1 and hA3 AR play an important role in tumor proliferation. We 
designed and synthesized novel 1,3,5-triazine derivatives through amination and 
Suzuki coupling, and evaluated them for binding affinities to each hAR subtype. 
Compounds 9a and 11b showed good binding affinity to both hA1 and hA3 AR, while 
9c showed the highest binding affinity to hA1 AR. In this study, we discovered 
that 9c inhibits cell viability, leading to cell death in lung cancer cell 
lines. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that 9c caused an increase in 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a depolarization of the 
mitochondrial membrane potential. The binding mode of 1,3,5-triazine derivatives 
to hA1 and hA3 AR were predicted by a molecular docking study.
