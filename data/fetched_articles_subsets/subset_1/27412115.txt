BACKGROUND: Numerous case-control studies have been performed to investigate the 
association between three cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) polymorphisms (rs20417 
(-765G > C), rs689466 (-1195G > A), and rs5275 (8473 T > C)) and the risk of 
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the results were 
inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the 
association.
METHODS: We searched in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to January 20, 
2015 (last updated on May 12, 2016). Two independent reviewers extracted the 
data. Odds ratios (ORs) with their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to 
assess the association. All statistical analyses were performed using the Review 
Manager (RevMan) 5.2 software.
RESULTS: Finally 8 case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis. For 
unadjusted data, an association with increased risk was observed in three 
genetic models in COX-2 rs689466 polymorphism; however, COX-2 rs5275 and rs20417 
polymorphisms were not related to HNSCC risk in this study. The pooled results 
from adjusted data all revealed non-significant association between these three 
polymorphisms and risk of HNSCC. We also found a similar result in the subgroup 
analyses, based on both unadjusted data and adjusted data.
CONCLUSION: Current results suggest that COX-2 rs689466, rs5275, and rs20417 
polymorphisms are not associated with HNSCC. Further large and well-designed 
studies are necessary to validate this association.
