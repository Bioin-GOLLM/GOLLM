Latent transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-binding protein 2 (LTBP2) is an 
extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that associates with fibrillin-1 containing 
microfibrils. Various factors prompted considering LTBP2 in the etiology of 
isolated ectopia lentis and associated conditions such as Weill-Marchesani 
syndrome (WMS) and Marfan syndrome (MFS). LTBP2 was screened in 30 unrelated 
Iranian patients. Mutations were found only in one WMS proband and one MFS 
proband. Homozygous c.3529G>A (p.Val1177Met) was shown to cause autosomal 
recessive WMS or WM-like syndrome by several approaches, including homozygosity 
mapping. Light, fluorescent, and electron microscopy evidenced disruptions of 
the microfibrillar network in the ECM of the proband's skin. In conjunction with 
recent findings regarding other ECM proteins, the results presented strongly 
support the contention that anomalies in WMS patients are due to disruptions in 
the ECM. Heterozygous c.1642C >T (p.Arg548*) possibly contributed to MFS-related 
phenotypes, including ocular manifestations, mitral valve prolapse, and pectus 
excavatum, but was not cause of MFS.
