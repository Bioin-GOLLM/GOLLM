BACKGROUND: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography using a short double-balloon 
endoscope (DB-ERC) is a promising minimally-invasive method for accessing 
hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) anastomosis in patients with surgically altered 
anatomy. We aimed to evaluate the immediate and long-term outcomes of balloon 
dilatation for benign HJ anastomotic stricture (HJAS) in patients who had 
previously undergone Whipple's procedure using a DB-ERC.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 46 patients who underwent 
balloon dilatation alone with a DB-ERC for benign HJAS between November 2008 and 
November 2014. The median follow-up duration was 3.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 
1.9-5.1) years.
RESULTS: The technical and clinical success rates were 100%, and adverse events 
occurred in 7% (3/46, cholangitis). The median hospitalization period was seven 
(IQR, 5-10) days. Of 42 patients (91%) followed-up for > 1 year, 24 (51%) had 
recurrent HJAS at a median of 1.2 (IQR, 0.6-2.9) years after balloon dilatation. 
The cumulative anastomotic patency rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 73, 55, and 
49%, respectively. In univariate analysis, early stricture formation (< 1 year) 
was a risk factor for recurrent stenosis, although no statistically significant 
risk factors were observed in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic balloon dilatation with DB-ERC for benign HJAS is 
effective and safe, having good immediate technical success and few adverse 
events. Further improvements to this procedure are needed to prevent recurrent 
HJAS.
