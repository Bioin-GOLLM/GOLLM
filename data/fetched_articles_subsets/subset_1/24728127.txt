AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Glucokinase (GCK) plays a role in glucose metabolism and 
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Rare mutations in GCK cause MODY. We 
investigated whether common variation (minor allele frequency ≥0.01) in GCK is 
associated with metabolic traits and type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: Four exonic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and three SNPs 
predicted to cause loss of promoter function were identified in whole-genome 
sequence data from 234 Pima Indians. These seven tag SNPs and rs4607517, a type 
2 diabetes variant established in other studies, were analysed in 415 
full-heritage non-diabetic Pima Indians characterised for metabolic traits, and 
7,667 American Indians who had data on type 2 diabetes and BMI.
RESULTS: A novel 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) SNP, chr7:44184184-G/A, was 
associated with the rate of carbohydrate oxidation post-absorptively (β = 0.22 
mg [kg estimated metabolic body size (EMBS)](-1) min(-1), p = 0.005) and during 
a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (β = 0.24 mg [kg EMBS](-1) min(-1), 
p = 0.0002), the rate of carbohydrate oxidation in a respiratory chamber 
(β = 311 kJ/day, p = 0.03) and 24 h energy expenditure, which was attributable 
to the thermic effect of food (β = 520 kJ/day, p = 3.39 × 10(-6)). This 3'UTR 
SNP was also associated with diabetes (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.11, 1.65, p = 0.002), 
where the A allele (allele frequency 0.05) was associated with a lower rate of 
carbohydrate oxidation, lower 24 h energy expenditure and higher risk for 
diabetes. In a Cox proportional hazards model, a rate of insulin-stimulated 
carbohydrate oxidation lower than the mean rate at baseline predicted a higher 
risk for developing diabetes than for those above the mean (hazard rate ratio 
2.2, 95% CI 1.3, 3.6, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Common variation in GCK influences the rate of 
carbohydrate oxidation, 24 h energy expenditure and diabetes risk in Pima 
Indians.
