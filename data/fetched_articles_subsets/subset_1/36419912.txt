BACKGROUND: Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACT deficiency) is 
a rare and life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder of mitochondrial fatty 
acid oxidation caused by variant of SLC25A20 gene. The most prevalent missense 
variant in the SLC25A20 gene in Asia was c.199-10T > G. Due to the c.199-10T > G 
variant, CACT deficiency is a severe phenotype.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, we present a neonatal case with c.199-10T > G 
variant in China and analyze the clinical, biochemical, and genetic aspects of 
78 patients previously identified with CACT deficiency.
RESULTS: The patient presented with a series of severe metabolic crises that 
rapidly deteriorated and eventually died 3 days after delivery. The sequencing 
of the patient's genome indicated that he was homozygous for the c.199-10T > G 
variant. 30 patients were found to have the c.199-10T > G mutation, of which 23 
were Chinese and 22 were afflicted by the c.199-10T > G splicing variation. In 
China, c.199-10T > G allele frequency was 82.6%.
CONCLUSION: In CACT deficiency, prompt recognition and treatment are critical. 
Our data suggested that c.199-10T > G may be a potential hotspot SLC25A20 gene 
mutation in the Chinese population. Detection of single nucleotide polymorphism 
is possible for high-risk patients and parents in China.
