Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is autosomal dominant and it is the most common 
hereditary disease. This case report is about a woman and her daughter. Both of 
them are NF1 and mother also has metachronous bilateral breast carcinoma. We 
analyzed expressions of 84 genes related with DNA Repair by Real Time PCR (AB 
Applied Biosystem 7000 Sequence Detection System; Thermo Fisher, Foster City, 
CA, USA). We also performed NF1 sequencing analyzing in exon 9 of the NF1 gene 
for mother. In Real Time PCR analysis of DNA Repair Genes, expression chances 
were predominant both in mother and daughter compared with control group. When 
the mother and daughter's expression profiles were compared, similar DNA repair 
array gene expression profiles were observed and the expression of DDB2, MGMT, 
MLH1, POLB UNG, XPA genes were high in both mother and daughter. In sequencing 
analysis, we obtained a mutation in c.1246 C>T. This mutation is reported to be 
common in NF1 cases with breast carcinoma. Our results indicate that the 
daughter with NF1 is probably prone to have malignancy in her future life. She 
should be carefully followed up for early diagnosis of a probable malignancy.
