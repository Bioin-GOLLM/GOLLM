Annexin A2 is a pleiotropic calcium- and anionic phospholipid-binding protein 
that exists as a monomer and as a heterotetrameric complex with the plasminogen 
receptor protein, S100A10. Annexin A2 has been proposed to play a key role in 
many processes including exocytosis, endocytosis, membrane organization, ion 
channel conductance, and also to link F-actin cytoskeleton to the plasma 
membrane. Despite an impressive list of potential binding partners and 
regulatory activities, it was somewhat unexpected that the annexin A2-null mouse 
should show a relatively benign phenotype. Studies with the annexin A2-null 
mouse have suggested important functions for annexin A2 and the heterotetramer 
in fibrinolysis, in the regulation of the LDL receptor and in cellular redox 
regulation. However, the demonstration that depletion of annexin A2 causes the 
depletion of several other proteins including S100A10, fascin and affects the 
expression of at least sixty-one genes has confounded the reports of its 
function. In this review we will discuss the annexin A2 structure and function 
and its proposed physiological and pathological roles.
