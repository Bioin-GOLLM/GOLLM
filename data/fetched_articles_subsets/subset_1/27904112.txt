Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of 
α-galactosidase A. This disease is classified into two types, namely a classical 
and variant type. We herein present the case of a 36-year-old man who showed a 
renal variant of Fabry disease and was diagnosed at an early stage by the 
presence of mulberry cells. He had no history of general symptoms except for 
proteinuria. The presence of mulberry cells caused us to suspect Fabry disease 
and he was thereafter diagnosed to have a renal variant of Fabry disease based 
on the findings of a renal biopsy, a mutation analysis and a low level of 
α-galactosidase A activity.
