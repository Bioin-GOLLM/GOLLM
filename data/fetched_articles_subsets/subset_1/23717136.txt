Ginseng, the root of the Panax ginseng, has been a popular and widely-used 
traditional herbal medicine in Korea, China, and Japan for thousands of years. 
Now it has become popular as a functional health food and is used globally as a 
natural medicine. Evidence is accumulating in the literature on the 
physiological and pharmacological effects of P. ginseng on neurodegenerative 
diseases. Possible ginseng- or ginsenosides-mediated neuroprotective mechanisms 
mainly involve maintaining homeostasis, and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, 
anti-apoptotic, and immune-stimulatory activities. This review considers 
publications dealing with the various actions of P. ginseng that are indicative 
of possible neurotherapeutic efficacies in neurodegenerative diseases and 
neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.
