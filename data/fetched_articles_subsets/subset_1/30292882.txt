Mutations in the KCNA2 gene, coding for the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1.2, can 
cause developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Kv1.2 channels play an 
important role in the repolarization phase of an action potential in nerve 
cells. Here, we reprogrammed human skin fibroblasts from a 13-year-old male 
patient with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy carrying a point 
mutation (c.982T>G, p.Leu328Val) in KCNA2 to human induced pluripotent stem 
cells (iPSCs) (HIHDNEi001-A). The cells maintained a normal karyotype and their 
pluripotency state was verified by the expression and staining of several 
pluripotency markers and capability to differentiate into all three germ layers.
