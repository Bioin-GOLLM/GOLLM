Osteoporosis is a metabolic disease characterized by reduced osteoblast 
differentiation and proliferation. Oxidative stress plays a role in the 
pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Aucubin (AU), an iridoid glycoside, was previously 
shown to promote osteoblast differentiation. We investigated the effects of AU 
on MG63 human osteoblast-like cells treated with dexamethasone (Dex) or hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2) to induce oxidative damage. AU protected MG63 cells against 
apoptosis, and promoted increased expression of cytokines associated with 
osteoblast differentiation, including collagen I, osteocalcin (OCN), osteopontin 
(OPN), and osterix. In Dex- and H2O2-treated MG63 cells, AU also enhanced the 
expression of anti-oxidative stress-associated factors in the nuclear 
respiratory factor 2 signaling pathway, including superoxide dismutases 1 and 2, 
heme oxygenases 1 and 2, and catalase. In vivo, using a Dex-induced mouse model 
of osteoporosis, AU promoted increased cortical bone thickness, increased bone 
density, and tighter trabecular bone. Additionally, it stimulated an increase in 
the expression of collagen I, OCN, OPN, osterix, and phosphorylated Akt and 
Smads in bone tissue. Finally, AU stimulated the expression of cytokines 
associated with osteoblast differentiation in bone tissue and serum. Our data 
indicate AU may have therapeutic efficacy in osteoporosis.
