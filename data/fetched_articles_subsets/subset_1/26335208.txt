BACKGROUND: Transcriptomics analyses of bacteria (and other organisms) provide 
global as well as detailed information on gene expression levels and, 
consequently, on other processes in the cell. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has over 
the past few years become the most accurate method for global transcriptome 
measurements and for the identification of novel RNAs. This development has been 
accompanied by advances in the bioinformatics methods, tools and software 
packages that deal with the analysis of the large data sets resulting from 
RNA-seq efforts.
RESULTS: Based on years of experience in analyzing transcriptome data, we 
developed a user-friendly webserver that performs the statistical analysis on 
the gene expression values generated by RNA-seq. It also provides the user with 
a whole range of data plots. We benchmarked our RNA-seq pipeline, T-REx, using a 
case study of CodY mutants of Bacillus subtilis and show that it could easily 
and automatically reproduce the statistical analysis of the cognate publication. 
Furthermore, by mining the correlation matrices, k-means clusters and heatmaps 
generated by T-REx we observed interesting gene-behavior and identified 
sub-groups in the CodY regulon.
CONCLUSION: T-REx is a parameter-free statistical analysis pipeline for RNA-seq 
gene expression data that is dedicated for use by biologists and 
bioinformaticians alike. The tables and figures produced by T-REx are in most 
cases sufficient to accurately mine the statistical results. In addition to the 
stand-alone version, we offer a user-friendly webserver that only needs basic 
input ( http://genome2d.molgenrug.nl ).
