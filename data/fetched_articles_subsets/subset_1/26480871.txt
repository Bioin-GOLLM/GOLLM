BACKGROUND: Synaptic dysfunction is a key event in pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) where synapse loss 
pathologically correlates with cognitive decline and dementia. Although evidence 
suggests that aberrant protein production and aggregation are the causative 
factors in familial subsets of such diseases, drugs singularly targeting these 
hallmark proteins, such as amyloid-β, have failed in late stage clinical trials. 
Therefore, to provide a successful disease-modifying compound and address 
synaptic dysfunction and memory loss in AD and mixed pathology dementia, we 
repurposed a clinically proven drug, CMZ, with neuroprotective and 
anti-inflammatory properties via addition of nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP 
signaling property.
RESULTS: The novel compound, NMZ, was shown to retain the GABAA potentiating 
actions of CMZ in vitro and sedative activity in vivo. Importantly, NMZ restored 
LTP in hippocampal slices from AD transgenic mice, whereas CMZ was without 
effect. NMZ reversed amnestic blockade of acetylcholine receptors by scopolamine 
as well as NMDA receptor blockade by a benzodiazepine and a NO synthase 
inhibitor in the step-through passive avoidance (STPA) test of learning and 
working memory. A PK/PD relationship was developed based on STPA analysis 
coupled with pharmacokinetic measures of drug levels in the brain: at 1 nM 
concentration in brain and plasma, NMZ was able to restore memory consolidation 
in mice.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that NMZ embodies a promising pharmacological 
approach targeting synaptic dysfunction and opens new avenues for 
neuroprotective intervention strategies in mixed pathology AD, 
neurodegeneration, and dementia.
