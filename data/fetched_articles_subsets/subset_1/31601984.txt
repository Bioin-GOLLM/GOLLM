relies on lymphofollicular structures.

In peripherally acquired prion diseases, prions move through several tissues of 
the infected host, notably in the lymphoid tissue, long before the occurrence of 
neuroinvasion. Accumulation can even be restricted to the lymphoid tissue 
without neuroinvasion and clinical disease. Several experimental observations 
indicated that the presence of differentiated follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) 
in the lymphoid structures and the strain type are critical determinants of 
prion extraneural replication. In this context, the report that granulomatous 
structures apparently devoid of FDCs could support prion replication raised the 
question of the requirements for prion lymphotropism. The report also raised the 
possibility that nonlymphoid tissue-tropic prions could actually target these 
inflammatory structures. To investigate these issues, we examined the capacity 
of closely related prions, albeit with opposite lymphotropism (or FDC 
dependency), for establishment in experimentally-induced granuloma in ovine PrP 
transgenic mice. We found a positive correlation between the prion capacity to 
accumulate in the lymphoid tissue and granuloma, regardless of the prion 
detection method used. Surprisingly, we also revealed that the accumulation of 
prions in granulomas involved lymphoid-like structures associated with the 
granulomas and containing cells that stain positive for PrP, Mfge-8 but not CD45 
that strongly suggest FDCs. These results suggest that the FDC requirement for 
prion replication in lymphoid/inflammatory tissues may be strain-dependent.
