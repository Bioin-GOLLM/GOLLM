Hb Q-Thailand [α74(EF3)Asp→His (α1), GAC>CAC, HBA1: c.223G>C] is an abnormal 
hemoglobin (Hb) frequently found in Thailand and Southeast Asian countries. The 
association of the αQ-Thailand allele with other globin gene disorders has 
important implications in diagnosis. Here, we report how to diagnose the 
coinheritance of Hb Q-Thailand with β-thalassemia (β-thal)/Hb E disease in four 
Thai samples from high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary 
electrophoresis (CE) testing results. Understanding of the HPLC chromatogram and 
CE electropherogram patterns of this complex mutation is important for 
interpretation of testing results and providing genetic counseling.
