Cofilin mediates lamellipodium extension and polarized cell migration by 
stimulating actin filament dynamics at the leading edge of migrating cells. 
Cofilin is inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser-3 and reactivated by 
cofilin-phosphatase Slingshot-1L (SSH1L). Little is known of signaling 
mechanisms of cofilin activation and how this activation is spatially regulated. 
Here, we show that cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L increases approximately 
10-fold by association with actin filaments, which indicates that actin assembly 
at the leading edge per se triggers local activation of SSH1L and thereby 
stimulates cofilin-mediated actin turnover in lamellipodia. We also provide 
evidence that 14-3-3 proteins inhibit SSH1L activity, dependent on the 
phosphorylation of Ser-937 and Ser-978 of SSH1L. Stimulation of cells with 
neuregulin-1beta induced Ser-978 dephosphorylation, translocation of SSH1L onto 
F-actin-rich lamellipodia, and cofilin dephosphorylation. These findings suggest 
that SSH1L is locally activated by translocation to and association with F-actin 
in lamellipodia in response to neuregulin-1beta and 14-3-3 proteins negatively 
regulate SSH1L activity by sequestering it in the cytoplasm.
