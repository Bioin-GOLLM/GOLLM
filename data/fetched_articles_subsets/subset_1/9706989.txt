In our experiments, we evaluated the possible effect of M235T molecular variant 
of the angiotensinogen gene on the response to a physical workload. A group of 
volunteers was composed of healthy male subjects, approximately of the same 
weight and height, same age and not actively trained. None of these subjects was 
under any medication. Blood sampling was carried out via an indwelling catheter. 
Besides blood pressure and heart rate, angiotensin I, angiotensin II, 
epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were measured in the blood. Our 
results suggest that only the response of diastolic blood pressure during 
submaximal exercise corresponded to the presence of M235T molecular variant. In 
all other parameters we found no significant correlation of the response with 
the M235T molecular variant.
