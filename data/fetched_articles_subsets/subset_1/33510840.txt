The human apoptosis-inducing factor (hAIF) is a moonlight flavoprotein involved 
in mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly and caspase-independent programmed 
cell death. These functions might be modulated by its redox-linked structural 
transition that enables hAIF to act as a NAD(H/+) redox sensor. Upon reduction 
with NADH, hAIF undergoes a conformational reorganization in two specific 
insertions-the flexible regulatory C-loop and the 190-202 β-harpin-promoting 
protein dimerization and the stabilization of a long-life charge transfer 
complex (CTC) that modulates its monomer-dimer equilibrium and its protein 
interaction network in healthy mitochondria. In this regard, here, we 
investigated the precise function of the β-hairpin in the AIF conformation 
landscape related to its redox mechanism, by analyzing the role played by W196, 
a key residue in the interaction of this motif with the regulatory C-loop. 
Mutations at W196 decrease the compactness and stability of the oxidized hAIF, 
indicating that the β-hairpin and C-loop coupling contribute to protein 
stability. Kinetic studies complemented with computational simulations reveal 
that W196 and the β-hairpin conformation modulate the low efficiency of hAIF as 
NADH oxidoreductase, contributing to configure its active site in a noncompetent 
geometry for hydride transfer and to stabilize the CTC state by enhancing the 
affinity for NAD+. Finally, the β-hairpin motif contributes to define the 
conformation of AIF's interaction surfaces with its physiological partners. 
These findings improve our understanding on the molecular basis of hAIF's 
cellular activities, a crucial aspect for clarifying its associated pathological 
mechanisms and developing new molecular therapies.
