Prions are conformationally flexible proteins capable of adopting a native state 
and a spectrum of alternative states associated with a change in the function of 
the protein. These alternative states are prone to assemble into amyloid 
aggregates, which provide a structure for self-replication and transmission of 
the underlying conformer and thereby the emergence of a new phenotype. Amyloid 
appearance is a rare event in vivo, regulated by both the aggregation propensity 
of prion proteins and their cellular environment. How these forces normally 
intersect to suppress amyloid appearance and the ways in which these 
restrictions can be bypassed to create protein-only phenotypes remain poorly 
understood. The most widely studied and perhaps most experimentally tractable 
system to explore the mechanisms regulating amyloid appearance is the [PIN+] 
prion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. [PIN+] is required for the appearance of the 
amyloid state for both native yeast proteins and for human proteins expressed in 
yeast. These observations suggest that [PIN+] facilitates the bypass of amyloid 
regulatory mechanisms by other proteins in vivo. Several models of prion 
appearance are compatible with current observations, highlighting the complexity 
of the process and the questions that must be resolved to gain greater insight 
into the mechanisms regulating these events.
