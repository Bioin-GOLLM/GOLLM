Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating chronic disease 
and the third-leading cause of mortality worldwide. It is characterized by 
airway neutrophilia, promoting tissue injury through release of toxic mediators 
and proteases. Recently, it has been shown that neutrophil-derived extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) from lungs of patients with COPD can cause a neutrophil 
elastase-dependent (NE-dependent) COPD-like disease upon transfer to mouse 
airways. However, in vivo preclinical models elucidating the impact of EVs on 
disease are lacking, delaying opportunities for therapeutic testing. Here, we 
developed an in vivo preclinical mouse model of lung EV-induced COPD. EVs from 
in vivo LPS-activated mouse neutrophils induced COPD-like disease in naive 
recipients through an Î±-1 antitrypsin-resistant, NE-dependent mechanism. 
Together, these results show a key pathogenic and mechanistic role for 
neutrophil-derived EVs in a mouse model of COPD. Broadly, the in vivo model 
described herein could be leveraged to develop targeted therapies for severe 
lung disease.
