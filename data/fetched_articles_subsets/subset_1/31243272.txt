CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems function to protect bacteria from invasion by 
foreign genetic elements. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been widely adopted as a 
powerful genome-editing tool, and phage-encoded inhibitors, known as 
anti-CRISPRs, offer a means of regulating its activity. Here, we report the 
crystal structures of anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIC2Nme alone and in complex with 
Nme1Cas9. We demonstrate that AcrIIC2Nme inhibits Cas9 through interactions with 
the positively charged bridge helix, thereby preventing sgRNA loading. In vivo 
phage plaque assays and in vitro DNA cleavage assays show that AcrIIC2Nme 
mediates its activity through a large electronegative surface. This work shows 
that anti-CRISPR activity can be mediated through the inhibition of Cas9 complex 
assembly.
