Fic proteins are ubiquitous in all of the domains of life and have critical 
roles in multiple cellular processes through AMPylation of (transfer of AMP to) 
target proteins. Doc from the doc-phd toxin-antitoxin module is a member of the 
Fic family and inhibits bacterial translation by an unknown mechanism. Here we 
show that, in contrast to having AMPylating activity, Doc is a new type of 
kinase that inhibits bacterial translation by phosphorylating the conserved 
threonine (Thr382) of the translation elongation factor EF-Tu, rendering EF-Tu 
unable to bind aminoacylated tRNAs. We provide evidence that EF-Tu 
phosphorylation diverged from AMPylation by antiparallel binding of the NTP 
relative to the catalytic residues of the conserved Fic catalytic core of Doc. 
The results bring insights into the mechanism and role of phosphorylation of 
EF-Tu in bacterial physiology as well as represent an example of the catalytic 
plasticity of enzymes and a mechanism for the evolution of new enzymatic 
activities.
