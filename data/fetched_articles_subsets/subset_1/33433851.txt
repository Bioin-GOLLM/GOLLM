The phenotypes of patients with disease-associated variants in DNMT1 have been 
classified into two syndromes: hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 
1E (HSAN1E, MIM614116, https://www.omim.org/ ) and autosomal dominant cerebellar 
ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy (ADCA-DN, MIM604121). The amino acid codon 511 
is a hotspot, and p.Y511C is the most frequently observed disease-associated 
variant among those in HSAN1E patients, whereas there have been only a few 
reports on patients with p.Y511H. In this study, we report on the cases of a 
kindred carrying the DNMT1 variant NM_001130823.2:c.1531 T > C (p.Y511H) 
presenting with the ADCA-DN phenotype. The review of the literature further 
revealed that later ages at onset and the presence of cerebellar ataxia are the 
main characteristics of patients carrying the DNMT1 p.Y511H as compared with 
those carrying DNMT1 p.Y511C. Although HSAN1E and ADCA-DN are proposed to be 
called DNMT1-complex disorders owing to their overlapping symptoms, this finding 
suggests a distinct genotype-phenotype correlation regarding the DNMT1 p.Y511H 
and p.Y511C variants.
