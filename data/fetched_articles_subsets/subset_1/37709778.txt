Phototherapy of deep tumors still suffers from many obstacles, such as limited 
near-infrared (NIR) tissue penetration depth and low accumulation efficiency 
within the target sites. Herein, stimuli-sensitive tumor-targeted photodynamic 
nanoparticles (STPNs) with persistent luminescence for the treatment of deep 
tumors are reported. Purpurin 18 (Pu18), a porphyrin derivative, is utilized as 
a photosensitizer to produce persistent luminescence in STPNs, while 
lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) exhibit bioimaging 
properties and possess high photostability that can enhance photosensitizer 
efficacy. STPNs are initially stimulated by NIR irradiation before intravenous 
administration and accumulate at the tumor site to enter the cells through the 
HER2 receptor. Due to Pu18 afterglow luminescence properties, STPNs can 
continuously generate ROS to inhibit NFκB nuclear translocation, leading to 
tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, STPNs can be used for diagnostic purposes 
through MRI and intraoperative NIR navigation. STPNs exceptional antitumor 
properties combined the advantages of UCNPs and persistent luminescence, 
representing a promising phototherapeutic strategy for deep tumors.
