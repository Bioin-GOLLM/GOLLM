Down-regulation of UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like containing PHD and Ring Finger 1) in 
Jurkat cells, induced by natural anticancer compounds such as thymoquinone, 
allows re-expression of tumor suppressor genes such as p73 and p16INK4A . In 
order to decipher the mechanisms of UHRF1 down-regulation, we investigated the 
kinetic of expression of HAUSP (herpes virus-associated ubiquitin-specific 
protease), UHRF1, cleaved caspase-3 and p73 in Jurkat cells treated with 
thymoquinone. We found that thymoquinone induced degradation of UHRF1, 
correlated with a sharp decrease in HAUSP and an increase in cleaved caspase-3 
and p73. UHRF1 concomitantly underwent a rapid ubiquitination in response to 
thymoquinone and this effect was not observed in the cells expressing mutant 
UHRF1 RING domain, suggesting that UHRF1 commits an auto-ubiquitination through 
its RING domain in response to thymoquinone treatment. Exposure of cells to 
Z-DEVD, an inhibitor of caspase-3 markedly reduced the thymoquinone-induced 
down-regulation of UHRF1, while proteosomal inhibitor MG132 had no such effect. 
The present findings indicate that thymoquinone induces in cancer cells a fast 
UHRF1 auto-ubiquitination through its RING domain associated with HAUSP 
down-regulation. They further suggest that thymoquinone-induced UHRF1 
auto-ubiquitination followed by its degradation is a key event in inducing 
apoptosis through a proteasome-independent mechanism.
