How complex, multi-component macromolecular machines evolved remains poorly 
understood. Here we reveal the evolutionary origins of the chemosensory 
machinery that controls flagellar motility in Escherichia coli. We first 
identify ancestral forms still present in Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, Shewanella oneidensis and Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum, 
characterizing their structures by electron cryotomography and finding evidence 
that they function in a stress response pathway. Using bioinformatics, we trace 
the evolution of the system through γ-Proteobacteria, pinpointing key 
evolutionary events that led to the machine now seen in E. coli. Our results 
suggest that two ancient chemosensory systems with different inputs and outputs 
(F6 and F7) existed contemporaneously, with one (F7) ultimately taking over the 
inputs and outputs of the other (F6), which was subsequently lost.
