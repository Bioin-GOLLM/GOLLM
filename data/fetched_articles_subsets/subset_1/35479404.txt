Sex differences in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases because of 
differential immune responses between females and males have been 
well-documented for multiple pathogens. However, the molecular mechanism 
underlying the observed sex differences in influenza virus infection remains 
poorly understood. In this study, we used a network-based approach to 
characterize the blood transcriptome collected over the course of infection with 
influenza A virus from female and male ferrets to dissect sex-biased gene 
expression. We identified significant differences in the temporal dynamics and 
regulation of immune responses between females and males. Our results elucidate 
sex-differentiated pathways involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), 
lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses, including a female-biased 
IRE1/XBP1 activation and male-biased crosstalk between metabolic reprogramming 
and IL-1 and AP-1 pathways. Overall, our study provides molecular insights into 
sex differences in transcriptional regulation of immune responses and 
contributes to a better understanding of sex biases in influenza pathogenesis.
