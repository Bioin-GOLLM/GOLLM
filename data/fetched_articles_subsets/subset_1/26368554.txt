BACKGROUND & AIMS: The presence of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) of 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) attenuates the efficacy of direct acting antivirals 
(DAAs). The objective of this study was to characterize the susceptibility of 
RAVs to interferon-based therapy.
METHODS: Direct and deep sequencing were performed to detect Y93H RAV in the 
NS5A region. Twenty nine genotype 1b patients with detectable RAV at baseline 
were treated by a combination of simeprevir, pegylated interferon and ribavirin. 
The longitudinal changes in the proportion of Y93H RAV during therapy and at 
breakthrough or relapse were determined.
RESULTS: By direct sequencing, Y93H RAV became undetectable or decreased in 
proportion at an early time point during therapy (within 7 days) in 57% of 
patients with both the Y93H variant and wild type virus at baseline when HCV RNA 
was still detectable. By deep sequencing, the proportion of Y93H RAV against Y93 
wild type was 52.7% (5.8%- 97.4%) at baseline which significantly decreased to 
29.7% (0.16%- 98.3%) within 7 days of initiation of treatment (p = 0.023). The 
proportion of Y93H RAV was reduced in 21 of 29 cases (72.4%) and a marked 
reduction of more than 10% was observed in 14 cases (48.7%). HCV RNA reduction 
was significantly greater for Y93H RAV (-3.65±1.3 logIU/mL/day) than the Y93 
wild type (-3.35±1.0 logIU/mL/day) (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Y93H RAV is more susceptible to interferon-based therapy than the 
Y93 wild type.
