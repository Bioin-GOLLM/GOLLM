Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the most abundant white blood cells, are 
recruited rapidly to sites of infection to exert potent anti-microbial activity. 
Information regarding their role in infection with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) is limited. Here we report that addition of PMNs to HIV-infected cultures 
of human tonsil tissue or peripheral blood mononuclear cells causes immediate 
and long-lasting suppression of HIV-1 spread and virus-induced depletion of CD4 
T cells. This inhibition of HIV-1 spread strictly requires PMN contact with 
infected cells and is not mediated by soluble factors. 2-Photon (2PM) imaging 
visualized contacts of PMNs with HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells in tonsil tissue 
that do not result in lysis or uptake of infected cells. The anti-HIV activity 
of PMNs also does not involve degranulation, formation of neutrophil 
extracellular traps, or integrin-dependent cell communication. These results 
reveal that PMNs efficiently blunt HIV-1 replication in primary target cells and 
tissue by an unconventional mechanism.
