Establishment of a functional vascular network is rate-limiting in embryonic 
development, tissue repair and engineering. During blood vessel formation, newly 
generated endothelial cells rapidly expand into primitive plexi that undergo 
vascular remodeling into circulatory networks, requiring coordinated growth 
inhibition and arterial-venous specification. Whether the mechanisms controlling 
endothelial cell cycle arrest and acquisition of specialized phenotypes are 
interdependent is unknown. Here we demonstrate that fluid shear stress, at 
arterial flow magnitudes, maximally activates NOTCH signaling, which upregulates 
GJA4 (commonly, Cx37) and downstream cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1B (p27). Blockade 
of any of these steps causes hyperproliferation and loss of arterial 
specification. Re-expression of GJA4 or CDKN1B, or chemical cell cycle 
inhibition, restores endothelial growth control and arterial gene expression. 
Thus, we elucidate a mechanochemical pathway in which arterial shear activates a 
NOTCH-GJA4-CDKN1B axis that promotes endothelial cell cycle arrest to enable 
arterial gene expression. These insights will guide vascular regeneration and 
engineering.
