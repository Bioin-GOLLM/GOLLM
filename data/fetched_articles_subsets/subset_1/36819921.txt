Glioma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and accounts 
for approximately 80% of brain and central nervous system tumors. In 2021, the 
World Health Organization (WHO) published a new taxonomy for glioma based on its 
histological features and molecular alterations. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 
catalyzes the decarboxylation of isocitrate, a critical metabolic reaction in 
energy generation in cells. Mutations in the IDH genes interrupt cell 
differentiation and serve as molecular biomarkers that can be used to classify 
gliomas. For example, the mutant IDH is widely detected in low-grade gliomas, 
whereas the wild type is in high-grade ones, including glioblastomas. Long 
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are epigenetically involved in gene expression and 
contribute to glioma development. To investigate the potential use of lncRNAs as 
biomarkers, we examined lncRNA dysregulation dependent on the IDH mutation 
status. We found that several lncRNAs, namely, AL606760.2, H19, MALAT1, PVT1 and 
SBF2-AS1 may function as glioma risk factors, whereas AC068643.1, AC079228.1, 
DGCR5, FAM13A-AS1, HAR1A and WDFY3-AS2 may have protective effects. Notably, 
H19, MALAT1, PVT1, and SBF2-AS1 have been associated with temozolomide 
resistance in glioma patients. This review study suggests that targeting 
glioma-associated lncRNAs might aid the treatment of glioma.
