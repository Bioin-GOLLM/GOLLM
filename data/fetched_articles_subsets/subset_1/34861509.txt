Transplantation of xenogeneic organs is an attractive solution to the existing 
organ shortage dilemma, thus, securing a clinically acceptable prolongation of 
xenograft survival is an important goal. In preclinical transplantation models, 
recipients of liver, kidney, heart, or lung xenotransplants demonstrate 
significant graft damages through the release of pro-inflammatory molecules, 
including the C-reactive protein, cytokines, and histone-DNA complexes that all 
foster graft rejection. Recent studies have demonstrated that mitigation of 
ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) greatly improves xenograft survival. Organ IRI 
develops primarily on a complex network of cytokines and chemokines responding 
to molecular cues from the graft milieu. Among these, interleukin 27 (IL-27) 
plays an immunomodulatory role in IRI onset due to graft environment-dependent 
pro- and anti- inflammatory activities. This review focuses on the impact of 
IL-27 on IRI of liver xenotransplants and provides insights on the function of 
IL-27 that could potentially guide genetic engineering strategies of donor pigs 
and/or conditioning of organs prior to transplantation.
