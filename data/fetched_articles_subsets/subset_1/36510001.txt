Advanced and metastatic prostate cancer is often incurable, but its dependency 
on certain molecular alterations may provide the basis for targeted therapies. A 
growing body of research has demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor gamma (PPARγ) is amplified as prostate cancer progresses. PPARγ has 
been shown to support prostate cancer growth through its roles in fatty acid 
synthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and co-operating with androgen receptor 
signalling. Interestingly, splice variants of PPARγ may have differing and 
contrasting roles. PPARγ itself is a highly druggable target, with agonists 
having been used for the past two decades in treating diabetes. However, side 
effects associated with these compounds have currently limited clinical use of 
these drugs in prostate cancer. Further understanding of PPARγ and novel 
techniques to target it, may provide therapies for advanced prostate cancer.
