Notch family members are transmembrane receptors that mediate essential 
developmental programs. Upon ligand binding, a proteolytic event releases the 
intracellular domain of Notch, which translocates to the nucleus to regulate 
gene transcription. In addition, Notch trafficking across the endolysosomal 
system is critical in its regulation. In this study we report that Notch 
recycling to the cell surface is dependent on the COMMD-CCDC22-CCDC93 (CCC) 
complex, a recently identified regulator of endosomal trafficking. Disruption in 
this system leads to intracellular accumulation of Notch2 and concomitant 
reduction in Notch signaling. Interestingly, among the 10 copper metabolism 
MURR1 domain containing (COMMD) family members that can associate with the CCC 
complex, only COMMD9 and its binding partner, COMMD5, have substantial effects 
on Notch. Furthermore, Commd9 deletion in mice leads to embryonic lethality and 
complex cardiovascular alterations that bear hallmarks of Notch deficiency. 
Altogether, these studies highlight that the CCC complex controls Notch 
activation by modulating its intracellular trafficking and demonstrate 
cargo-specific effects for members of the COMMD protein family.
