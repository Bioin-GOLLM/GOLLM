Most patients with diabetes mellitus are asymptomatic, which leads to delayed 
and more complex treatment. At the same time, most individuals are routinely 
subjected to standard clinical laboratory examinations, which create large 
health datasets over a lifetime. Computer processing has been used to search for 
health anomalies and predict diseases using clinical examinations. This work 
studied machine learning models to support the screening of diabetes through 
routine laboratory tests using data from laboratory tests of 62,496 patients. 
The classification and regression models used were the K-nearest neighbor, 
support vector machines, Bayes naïve, random forest models, and artificial 
neural networks. Glycated hemoglobin, a test used for diabetes diagnosis, was 
used as the target. Regression models calculated glycated hemoglobin directly 
and were later classified. The performance of classification computer models has 
been studied under various subdataset partitions and combinations (e.g., 
healthy, prediabetic, and diabetes, as well as no healthy and no diabetes). The 
best single performance was achieved with the artificial neural network model 
when detecting prediabetes or diabetes. The artificial neural network 
classification model scored 78.1%, 78.7%, and 78.4% for sensitivity, precision, 
and F1 scores, respectively, when identifying no healthy group. Other models 
also had good results, depending on what is desired. Machine learning-based 
models can predict glycated hemoglobin values from routine laboratory tests and 
can be used as a screening tool to refer a patient for further testing.
