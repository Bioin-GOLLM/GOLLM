BACKGROUND: Mutations of both the PMP22 and EGR2 genes cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
(CMT) disease type 1. Deletion of the PMP22 gene, results in hereditary 
neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. More publications exist about the 
interaction of PMP22 duplication and other CMT-causing gene mutations. In these 
cases the intrafamiliar discordant phenotypes draw the attention to the possible 
role of modifying genes. The gene-gene interactions between the PMP22 and EGR2 
genes are not well understood.
CASE REPORT: We report two brothers with late onset CMT1 due to a c. 1142 G>A 
(Arg381His) heterozygous substitution in the EGR2 gene. Additionally, the older 
brother with the less severe symptoms harbored the PMP22 gene deletion also.
CONCLUSION: The coexistence of the two genetic alterations did not aggravate the 
clinical symptoms. Moreover, the PMP22 deletion appeared to have a beneficial 
modifying effect, thus implying potential gene-gene interaction of PMP22 and 
EGR2. PMP22 deletion may increase Schwann cells proliferation and compensate the 
dominant-negative effect of the Arg381 His substitution in the EGR2 gene.
