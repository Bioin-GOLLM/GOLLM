OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of a 
continuous estrogen, cyclic progesterone replacement therapy on the secretion of 
growth hormone (GH) and IGF I as well as of somatometric-GH correlation 
patterns.
METHODS: The study included 23 healthy postmenopausal women. Of the proband 
group 13 randomly selected women were treated with orally applicated 2 mg 
estradiol-valerat (E2V) and 10 mg dydrogesterone for 10 months. Ten women did 
not receive any hormonal treatment during this time. After 10 months all 
probands were reexamined and their GH and IGF I secretion, as well as their 
somatometric-hormonal correlation patterns, compared with those of a fertile 
control group.
RESULTS: It could be shown, that in postmenopausal women a 10-month oral hormone 
replacement therapy led to a significant increase of GH- and IGF I levels, 
however, the treated postmenopausal women did not reach the levels of the 
fertile controls. Those women who did not receive any hormonal treatment and the 
postmenopausal women before HRT showed nearly identical GH- and IGF I levels as 
well as somatometric-GH correlation patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present paper indicate a marked influence of 
estrogens on GH and IGF I secretion. Furthermore, hormonal replacement therapy 
(HRT) may influence somatometric GH correlation patterns too.
