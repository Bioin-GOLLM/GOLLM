The organisation of mammalian genomes into loops and topologically associating 
domains (TADs) contributes to chromatin structure, gene expression and 
recombination. TADs and many loops are formed by cohesin and positioned by CTCF. 
In proliferating cells, cohesin also mediates sister chromatid cohesion, which 
is essential for chromosome segregation. Current models of chromatin folding and 
cohesion are based on assumptions of how many cohesin and CTCF molecules 
organise the genome. Here we have measured absolute copy numbers and dynamics of 
cohesin, CTCF, NIPBL, WAPL and sororin by mass spectrometry, 
fluorescence-correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence recovery after 
photobleaching in HeLa cells. In G1-phase, there are ~250,000 nuclear cohesin 
complexes, of which ~ 160,000 are chromatin-bound. Comparison with chromatin 
immunoprecipitation-sequencing data implies that some genomic cohesin and CTCF 
enrichment sites are unoccupied in single cells at any one time. We discuss the 
implications of these findings for how cohesin can contribute to genome 
organisation and cohesion.
