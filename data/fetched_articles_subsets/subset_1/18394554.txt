We report that TG101348, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of JAK2 with an in 
vitro IC50 of approximately 3 nM, shows therapeutic efficacy in a murine model 
of myeloproliferative disease induced by the JAK2V617F mutation. In treated 
animals, there was a statistically significant reduction in hematocrit and 
leukocyte count, a dose-dependent reduction/elimination of extramedullary 
hematopoiesis, and, at least in some instances, evidence for attenuation of 
myelofibrosis. There were no apparent toxicities and no effect on T cell number. 
In vivo responses were correlated with surrogate endpoints, including 
reduction/elimination of JAK2V617F disease burden assessed by quantitative 
genomic PCR, suppression of endogenous erythroid colony formation, and in vivo 
inhibition of JAK-STAT signal transduction as assessed by flow cytometric 
measurement of phosphorylated Stat5.
