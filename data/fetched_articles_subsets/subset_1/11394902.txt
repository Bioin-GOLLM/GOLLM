Caveolae are flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane formed by the 
association of caveolin proteins with lipid rafts. In endothelial cells, 
caveolae function as signal transduction centers controlling NO synthesis and 
mechanotransduction. We now provide evidence that the endothelial 
volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is also under the control of the caveolar 
system. When calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells were transfected 
with caveolin-1 Delta1-81 (deletion of amino acids 1 to 81), activation of VRAC 
by hypotonic cell swelling was strongly impaired. Concomitantly, caveolin-1 
Delta1-81 disturbed the formation of caveolin-1 containing lipid rafts as 
evidenced by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. In nontransfected cells, 
endogenous caveolin-1 typically associated with low-density, detergent-resistant 
lipid rafts. However, transient expression of caveolin-1 Delta1-81 caused a 
redistribution of endogenous caveolin-1 to high-density, detergent-soluble 
membrane fractions. We therefore conclude that the interaction between 
caveolin-1 and detergent-resistant lipid rafts is an important prerequisite for 
endothelial VRAC activity.
