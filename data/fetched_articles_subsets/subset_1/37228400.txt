BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease (CHD) represents the most widespread 
congenital birth defect among neonates worldwide, leading to substantial 
expenses and contributing significantly to premature death caused by birth 
defects. Despite the significance of CHD, research on its etiology remains 
limited and has failed to provide substantial evidence for the molecular basis 
of the disease. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS), 
genetic screening has become increasingly accessible, offering a greater 
capability for identifying potential genetic variants associated with CHD.
CASE PRESENTATION: Exome sequencing and variant analysis of TMEM260 were 
performed to obtain genetic data, and clinical characteristics were determined. 
A complex and severe form of CHD, comprising a persistent truncus arteriosus 
type I, ventricular septal defect, right aortic arch, as well as critical 
neurodevelopmental delay and neurological dysfunction, was observed in a 
patient. This proband presented global muscle hypotonia and a significant delay 
in gross and fine motor development. Cranial computed tomography scanning showed 
the presence of bilateral apical, occipital, and temporal subdural effusions; 
slightly wider bilateral lateral ventricles and annular cisterns; and bilateral 
cerebral hemispheric parenchyma atrophy. Upon genetic analysis of the patient, a 
novel homozygous mutation was identified in the TMEM260 gene. The mutation, 
c.1336_1339DEL, was found to be homozygous and resulted in a frameshift 
mutation, causing a p.L447Vfs*9 amino acid change. This mutation led to the 
deletion of a TCTC sequence from positions 1336 to 1339 in the TMEM260 gene, 
changing leucine to valine at amino acid 447 and introducing a stop codon after 
the ninth amino acid. This structural deletion in the TMEM260 protein resulted 
in the loss of gene function.
CONCLUSION: This case report presents a newly discovered variant site in the 
TMEM260 gene and reinforces the relationship between TMEM260 molecular function 
and differentiation of mesoderm and ectoderm. Furthermore, our findings broaden 
the spectrum of variants in the TMEM260 gene and contribute to advancing the 
genetic understanding of CHD.
