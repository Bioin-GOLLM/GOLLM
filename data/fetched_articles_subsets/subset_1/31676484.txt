Altered regulation of exocytosis is an important mechanism controlling many 
diseases, including cancer. Defects in exocytosis have been implicated in many 
cancer cell types and are generally attributed to mutations in cellular 
transport, trafficking, and assembly of machinery necessary for exocytosis of 
secretory vesicle cargo. In these cancers, up-regulation of trafficking and 
secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a proteolytic enzyme, is 
responsible for degrading the extracellular matrix, a necessary step in tumor 
progression. Using TIRF microscopy, we identified proteins associated with 
secretory vesicles containing MMP-9 and imaged the local dynamics of these 
proteins at fusion sites during regulated exocytosis of MMP-9 from MCF-7 breast 
cancer cells. We found that many regulators of exocytosis, including several Rab 
GTPases, Rab effector proteins, and SNARE/SNARE modulator proteins, are stably 
assembled on docked secretory vesicles before exocytosis. At the moment of 
fusion, many of these components are quickly lost from the vesicle, while 
several endocytic proteins and lipids are simultaneously recruited to exocytic 
sites at precisely that moment. Our findings provide insight into the dynamic 
behavior of key core exocytic proteins, accessory proteins, lipids, and some 
endocytic proteins at single sites of secretory vesicle fusion in breast cancer 
cells.
