PURPOSE: In EGFR-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), outcomes 
from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have differed historically by mutation type 
present, with lower benefit reported in patients with ex21L858R versus ex19del 
mutations. We investigated if EGFR-activating mutation subtypes impact treatment 
outcomes in the phase III RELAY study. Associations between EGFR mutation type 
and preexisting co-occurring and treatment-emergent genetic alterations were 
also explored.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with metastatic NSCLC, an EGFR ex19del or 
ex21L858R mutation, and no central nervous system metastases were randomized 
(1:1) to erlotinib (150 mg/day) with either ramucirumab (10 mg/kg; RAM+ERL) or 
placebo (PBO+ERL), every 2 weeks, until RECIST v1.1-defined progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). 
Secondary and exploratory endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), 
duration of response (DOR), PFS2, time-to-chemotherapy (TTCT), safety, and 
next-generation sequencing analyses.
RESULTS: Patients with ex19del and ex21L858R mutations had similar clinical 
characteristics and comutational profiles. One-year PFS rates for ex19del 
patients were 74% for RAM+ERL versus 54% for PBO+ERL; for ex21L858R rates were 
70% (RAM+ERL) versus 47% (PBO+ERL). Similar treatment benefits (ORR, DOR, PFS2, 
and TTCT) were observed in RAM+ERL-treated patients with ex19del and ex21L858R. 
Baseline TP53 comutation was associated with superior outcomes for RAM+ERL in 
both ex19del and ex21L858R subgroups. EGFR T790M mutation rate at progression 
was similar between treatment arms and by mutation type.
CONCLUSIONS: RAM+ERL provided significant clinical benefit for both EGFR ex19del 
and ex21L858R NSCLC, supporting this regimen as suitable for patients with 
either of these EGFR mutation types.
