Recent reports suggest that some SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants, such as B.1.1.7, 
might be more transmissible and are quickly spreading around the world. As the 
emergence of more transmissible variants could exacerbate the pandemic, we 
provide public health guidance for increased surveillance and measures to reduce 
community transmission.
