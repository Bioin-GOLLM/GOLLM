Human 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase-1 (OAS1) is central in innate immune 
system detection of cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and promotion of 
host antiviral responses. However, the molecular signatures that promote OAS1 
activation are currently poorly defined. We show that the 3'-end polyuridine 
sequence of viral and cellular RNA polymerase III non-coding transcripts is 
critical for their optimal activation of OAS1. Potentiation of OAS1 activity was 
also observed with a model dsRNA duplex containing an OAS1 activation consensus 
sequence. We determined that the effect is attributable to a single appended 
3'-end residue, is dependent upon its single-stranded nature with strong 
preference for pyrimidine residues and is mediated by a highly conserved OAS1 
residue adjacent to the dsRNA binding surface. These findings represent 
discovery of a novel signature for OAS1 activation, the 3'-single-stranded 
pyrimidine (3'-ssPy) motif, with potential functional implications for OAS1 
activity in its antiviral and other anti-proliferative roles.
