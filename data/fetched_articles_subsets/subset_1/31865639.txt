BACKGROUND: Individual identification is one of the most important tasks in the 
field of forensic genetics. Insertion/Deletion (InDel) polymorphism marker has 
been a promising marker for individual identification. However, a part of InDel 
loci in commonly used commercial kit show low polymorphisms in Chinese 
populations.
METHODS: We evaluated a panel of 35 InDel loci constructed previously for 
individual identifications in Hui group. Subsequently, population data of three 
Chinese populations from 1,000 Genomes Project database were used to evaluate 
individual identification performance of these 35 InDels. Forensic parameters, 
such as heterozygosity, power of exclusion, match probability and power of 
discrimination, were calculated to evaluate the forensic efficiency of these 
loci in Hui group. The heatmap of insertion allelic frequencies, Nei's genetic 
distances, pairwise fixation index values, principal component analyses and 
admixture analyses were used to analyze the genetic differentiations and 
structure between Hui group and other populations.
RESULTS: In studied Hui group, besides rs3054057, polymorphism information 
content values of the remaining loci were greater than 0.3. Values of expected 
heterozygosity of these loci were close to 0.5. The combined power of 
discrimination and power of exclusion values were 0.99999999999999659609 and 
0.998682, respectively. Analyses of population genetics revealed that Chinese 
Hui group had closer genetic relationships with East Asian populations than 
other intercontinental populations.
CONCLUSION: The forensic statistical analyses revealed these loci showed 
relatively high genetic polymorphisms in Chinese Hui group, and could be served 
as a useful tool for individual identifications in Hui group. Population genetic 
evaluations indicated that Chinese Hui group had close genetic relationships 
with East Asian populations.
