BACKGROUND: BRAF V600E mutation has been reported to show a high specificity for 
papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Using this marker to upgrade 'indeterminate' 
or 'suspicious' thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology to 'malignant' 
could potentially allow one-stage therapeutic total thyroidectomy.
METHODS: For a 14-month period, FNA cytology specimens in the Thy3-5 categories, 
which are the UK equivalents of indeterminate (Thy3a, atypical; Thy3f, 
follicular), suspicious for malignancy (Thy4) and malignant (Thy5) in the 
Bethesda System, underwent BRAF mutation testing by melt curve analysis. The 
results were correlated with histology.
RESULTS: We tested 123 cytology specimens of which 12 (9.8%) failed. The BRAF 
mutation rate in the remainder was 16.2% (18/111), with 93 showing the 
wild-type. Seventeen mutations were V600E and one was non-V600E. The rate of 
mutation increased significantly (P < 0.0001 if Thy3a and Thy3f were combined) 
with the cytology category: 1/42 Thy3a (2.4%), 1/36 Thy3f (2.8%), 4/15 Thy4 
(26.7%), 12/18 Thy5 (66.7%). All BRAF mutations correlated with PTC on 
histology, except for one recurrent PTC without histology. One mutation-positive 
case with Thy3a cytology showed the target lesion to be a 10-mm follicular 
adenoma on histology with an immediately adjacent 4-mm micro-PTC, in a patient 
who did not require total thyroidectomy.
CONCLUSION: BRAF mutational analysis by melt curve analysis is feasible in 
routine thyroid cytology, and in our series had a 100% specificity for PTC in 
subsequent histology. The application of BRAF analysis could be useful for 
indeterminate cytology, but we suggest that it would be most appropriate and 
cost-effective for Thy4/suspicious cases, for which it could enable one-stage 
therapeutic surgery in the context of multidisciplinary discussion. In contrast, 
the sensitivity is low and there is no role for avoiding diagnostic thyroid 
surgery if wild-type BRAF is found.
