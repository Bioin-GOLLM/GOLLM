The epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) is a major regulator of salt and water 
reabsorption in a number of epithelial tissues. Abnormalities in ENaC function 
have been directly linked to several human disease states including Liddle 
syndrome, psuedohypoaldosteronism, and cystic fibrosis and may be implicated in 
salt-sensitive hypertension. ENaC activity in epithelial cells is regulated both 
by open probability and channel number. This review focuses on the regulation of 
ENaC in the cells of the kidney cortical collecting duct by trafficking and 
recycling. The trafficking of ENaC is discussed in the broader context of 
epithelial cell vesicle trafficking. Well-characterized pathways and protein 
interactions elucidated using epithelial model cells are discussed, and the 
known overlap with ENaC regulation is highlighted. In following the life of ENaC 
in CCD epithelial cells the apical delivery, internalization, recycling, and 
destruction of the channel will be discussed. While a number of pathways 
presented still need to be linked to ENaC regulation and many details of the 
regulation of ENaC trafficking remain to be elucidated, knowledge of these 
mechanisms may provide further insights into ENaC activity in normal and disease 
states.
