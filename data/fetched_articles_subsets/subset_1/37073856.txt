SUMMARY: A 44-year-old athletic man presented in 2009 with severe low back pain. 
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry revealed severe osteoporosis; serum 
testosterone was 189 ng/dL while serum estradiol (E2) measured by liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry was 8 pg/mL. DNA was extracted and sequenced 
from a blood sample from the patient since his maternal first cousin also had 
low bone mass and both patients were screened for aromatase dysfunction by PCR 
analysis for the CYP19A1 gene, which encodes aromatase. No known pathologic 
mutations were observed in the coding exons, but novel single nucleotide 
polymorphisms were detected both in the proband and in his cousin. Treatment 
with topical testosterone started in August 2010. Over the next 8 years, 
testosterone dosage was varied and switched from topical gel to injections and 
maintained on depo-injections of testosterone at about 60 mg once per week. 
Re-examination in March 2012 included a brain MRI to exclude pituitary lesions; 
hyperparathyroidism was ruled out (normal serum parathyroid hormone, calcium, 
and calcium to phosphorous ratio) and celiac disease was excluded (negative 
transglutaminase antibodies). Follow-up in October 2018 showed improved bone 
mineral density of the lumbar spine by 29% and of the left femoral hip by 15% 
compared to baseline measurements. This reveals the importance of measuring 
serum E2 for making the correct diagnosis, as well as for monitoring a 
therapeutic effect. Herein, we propose treatment of male osteoporosis where 
serum E2 levels are below about 20 pg/mL with testosterone to reverse 
osteoporosis.
LEARNING POINTS: Estrogen deficiency in the diagnosis of male idiopathic 
osteoporosis. Importance of serum estradiol in male osteoporosis. Role of 
polymorphisms in aromatase gene on bone health. Reversal of osteoporosis. 
Tailored testosterone treatment for bone health.
