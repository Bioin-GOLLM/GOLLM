One of the most prevalent forms of post-transcritpional RNA modification is the 
conversion of adenosine nucleosides to inosine (A-to-I), mediated by the ADAR 
family of enzymes. The functional requirement and regulatory landscape for the 
majority of A-to-I editing events are, at present, uncertain. Recent studies 
have identified key in vivo functions of ADAR enzymes, informing our 
understanding of the biological importance of A-to-I editing. Large-scale 
studies have revealed how editing is regulated both in cis and in trans. This 
review will explore these recent studies and how they broaden our understanding 
of the functions and regulation of ADAR-mediated RNA editing.
