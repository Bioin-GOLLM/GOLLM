BACKGROUND: In Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), affected individuals are 
blind, or nearly so, from birth. This early onset suggests abnormal development 
of the neural retina. Mutations in genes that affect the development and/or 
function of photoreceptor cells have been found to be responsible in some 
families. These examples include mutations in the photoreceptor transcription 
factor, Crx.
RESULTS: A Crx mutant strain of mice was created to serve as a model for LCA and 
to provide more insight into Crx's function. In this study, an ultrastructural 
analysis of the developing retina in Crx mutant mice was performed. Outer 
segment morphogenesis was found to be blocked at the elongation stage, leading 
to a failure in production of the phototransduction apparatus. Further, Crx-/- 
photoreceptors demonstrated severely abnormal synaptic endings in the outer 
plexiform layer.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a synaptogenesis defect in an animal 
model for LCA. These data confirm the essential role this gene plays in multiple 
aspects of photoreceptor development and extend our understanding of the basic 
pathology of LCA.
