The ydaO riboswitch, involved in sporulation, osmotic stress responses and cell 
wall metabolism, targets the second messenger cyclic-di-AMP with subnanomolar 
affinity. We have solved the structure of c-di-AMP bound to the 
Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis ydaO riboswitch, thereby identifying a 
five-helical scaffold containing a zippered-up bubble, a pseudoknot and 
long-range tertiary base pairs. Highlights include the identification of two 
c-di-AMP binding pockets on the same face of the riboswitch, related by 
pseudo-two-fold symmetry, with potential for cross-talk between sites mediated 
by adjacently positioned base-stacking alignments connecting pockets. The 
adenine rings of bound c-di-AMP molecules are wedged between bases and 
stabilized by stacking, base-sugar and sugar-sugar intermolecular hydrogen 
bonding interactions. The structural studies are complemented by isothermal 
titration calorimetry-based binding studies of mutants mediating key tertiary 
intermolecular contacts. The T. tengcongensis ydaO riboswitch, like its Bacillus 
subtilis counterpart, most likely functions through a transcription termination 
mechanism, with the c-di-AMP bound state representing an 'off' switch.
