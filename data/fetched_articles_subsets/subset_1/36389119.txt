Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is an emerging tobamovirus that 
overcomes the Tm-2 2 resistance gene used in commercial tomato plants to protect 
against tobamoviruses. In this article, we show that ToBRFV is recognised 
through its P50 replicase fragment by the resistance gene N in N. tabacum , 
which triggers a hypersensitive response (HR). We also demonstrate that the N' 
gene provides protection against ToBRFV through recognition of the viral coat 
protein without triggering a typical HR in N. tabacum .
