T-helper (Th) cell differentiation drives specialized gene programs that dictate 
effector T cell function at sites of infection. Here, we have shown Th cell 
differentiation also imposes discrete motility gene programs that shape Th1 and 
Th2 cell navigation of the inflamed dermis. Th1 cells scanned a smaller tissue 
area in a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and chemokine-dependent fashion, 
while Th2 cells scanned a larger tissue area independent of GPCR signals. 
Differential chemokine reliance for interstitial migration was linked to STAT6 
transcription-factor-dependent programming of integrin αVβ3 expression: Th2 cell 
differentiation led to high αVβ3 expression relative to Th1 cells. Th1 and Th2 
cell modes of motility could be switched simply by manipulating the amount of 
αVβ3 on the cell surface. Deviating motility modes from those established during 
differentiation impaired effector function. Thus, programmed expression of αVβ3 
tunes effector T cell reliance on environmental cues for optimal exploration of 
inflamed tissues.
