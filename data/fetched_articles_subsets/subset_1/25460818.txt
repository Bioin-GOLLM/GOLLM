Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus; GAS) is a strict human pathogen 
with a very high prevalence worldwide. This review highlights the genetic 
organization of the species and the important ecological considerations that 
impact its evolution. Recent advances are presented on the topics of molecular 
epidemiology, population biology, molecular basis for genetic change, genome 
structure and genetic flux, phylogenomics and closely related streptococcal 
species, and the long- and short-term evolution of GAS. The application of whole 
genome sequence data to addressing key biological questions is discussed.
