BACKGROUND: Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) play a major role in detoxification 
of aldehydes. High expression of ALDHs is a marker for stem cells of many organs 
including the lungs. A common polymorphism in ALDH2 gene (ALDH2*2) results in 
inactivation of the enzyme and is associated with alcohol flushing syndrome and 
increased risk for cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases and some cancers. The 
effect of this ALDH2 polymorphism on the lung and its stem cells has not been 
thoroughly examined.
METHODS: We examined the association between the ALDH2*2 allele and lung 
function parameters in a population of healthy individuals. We also examined its 
association with the incidence of asthma and COPD in patient cohorts. We used 
the in vitro colony forming assay to detect the effect of the polymorphism on 
lung epithelial stem cells from both primary human surgical samples and Aldh2*2 
transgenic (Tg) and Aldh2 -/- mice. Response to acute and chronic lung injuries 
was compared between wild type (WT), Aldh2*2 Tg and Aldh2 -/- mice.
RESULTS: In humans, the ALDH2*2 allele was associated with lower FEV1/FVC in the 
general population, but not with the development of asthma or COPD. Both the 
bronchial and lung epithelium carrying the ALDH2*2 allele showed a tendency for 
lower colony forming efficiency (CFE) compared to ALDH2 allele. In mice, the 
tracheal epithelial thickness, nuclear density, and number of basal stem cells 
were significantly lower in Aldh2 -/- and Aldh2*2 Tg adult mice than in WT. 
Electron microscopy showed significantly increased number of morphologically 
abnormal mitochondria in the trachea of Aldh2 -/- mice. Aldh2 -/- tracheal and 
lung cells showed higher ROS levels and fewer functional mitochondria than those 
from WT mice. No significant differences were detected when tracheal and lung 
epithelial stem cells were examined for their in vitro CFE. When exposed to 
chronic cigarette smoke, Aldh2*2 Tg mice were resistant to emphysema 
development, whereas influenza infection caused more epithelial damage in Aldh2 
-/- mice than in WT mice.
CONCLUSIONS: ALDH2 polymorphism has several subtle effects on the lungs, some of 
which are similar to changes observed during normal aging, suggesting a 
"premature lung aging" effect.
