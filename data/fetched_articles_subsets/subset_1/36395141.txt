Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), generally (1) losses containing 
interferons and interferon-pathway genes, many on chromosome 9p, predict 
immune-cold, immune checkpoint therapy (ICT)-resistant tumors (2); however, 
genomic regions mediating these effects are unclear and probably tissue 
specific. Previously, 9p21.3 loss was found to be an early genetic driver of 
human papillomavirus-negative (HPV-) head and neck squamous cancer (HNSC), 
associated with an immune-cold tumor microenvironment (TME) signal, and recent 
evidence suggested that this TME-cold phenotype was greatly enhanced with 9p21 
deletion size, notably encompassing band 9p24.1 (3). Here, we report multi-omic, 
-threshold and continuous-variable dissection of 9p21 and 9p24 loci (including 
depth and degree of somatic alteration of each band at each locus, and each gene 
at each band) and TME of four HPV- HNSC cohorts. Preferential 9p24 deletion, CD8 
T-cell immune-cold associations were observed, driven by 9p24.1 loss, and in 
turn by an essential telomeric regulatory gene element, JAK2-CD274. 
Surprisingly, same genetic region gains were immune hot. Related 9p21-TME 
analyses were less evident. Inherent 9p-band-level influences on anti-PD1 ICT 
survival rates, coincident with TME patterns, were also observed. At a 9p24.1 
whole-transcriptome expression threshold of 60th percentile, ICT survival rate 
exceeded that of lower expression percentiles and of chemotherapy; below this 
transcript threshold, ICT survival was inferior to chemotherapy, the latter 
unaffected by 9p24.1 expression level (P-values < 0.01, including in a PD-L1 
immunohistochemistry-positive patient subgroup). Whole-exome analyses of 10 
solid-tumor types suggest that these 9p-related ICT findings could be relevant 
to squamous cancers, in which 9p24.1 gain/immune-hot associations exist.
