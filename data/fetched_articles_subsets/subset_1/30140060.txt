Leigh syndrome is one of the most common subtypes of mitochondrial disease. 
Mutations in encoding genes of oxidative phosphorylation complexes have been 
frequently reported, of which, MTATP6 was one of the most frequently reported 
genes for Leigh syndrome. In this study, by using next-generation sequencing 
targeted to MitoExome in a patient with clinical manifestations of Leigh 
syndrome, two missense mutations of NDUFS3 (c.418 C > T/p.R140W and 
c.595 C > T/p.R199W) were identified, of which c.418 C > T was novel. 
Functionally, the patient derived lymphoblastoid cells showed decreased amount 
of NDUFS3 and complex I assembly when compared with two control cells. Although 
NDUFS3 mutations have been related to late onset Leigh syndrome, we found that 
the patient carrying these two mutations developed an early onset Leigh 
syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the second study on patient carrying NDUFS3 
mutations. In conclusion, we identified a novel Leigh syndrome causing NDUFS3 
mutation and expanded the clinical spectrum caused by NDUFS3 mutations in this 
study.
