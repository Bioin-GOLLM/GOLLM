The human CDK-activating kinase (CAK), a complex composed of cyclin-dependent 
kinase (CDK) 7, cyclin H, and MAT1, is a critical regulator of transcription 
initiation and the cell cycle. It acts by phosphorylating the C-terminal 
heptapeptide repeat domain of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB1, which 
is an important regulatory event in transcription initiation by Pol II, and it 
phosphorylates the regulatory T-loop of CDKs that control cell cycle 
progression. Here, we have determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of 
the catalytic module of human CAK, revealing the structural basis of its 
assembly and providing insight into CDK7 activation in this context. The unique 
third component of the complex, MAT1, substantially extends the interaction 
interface between CDK7 and cyclin H, explaining its role as a CAK assembly 
factor, and it forms interactions with the CDK7 T-loop, which may contribute to 
enhancing CAK activity. We have also determined the structure of the CAK in 
complex with the covalently bound inhibitor THZ1 in order to provide insight 
into the binding of inhibitors at the CDK7 active site and to aid in the 
rational design of therapeutic compounds.
