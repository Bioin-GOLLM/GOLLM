Breast, prostate, pancreatic, colorectal, lung, and head and neck cancers 
exploit deregulated signaling by ErbB family receptors and their ligands, EGF 
family peptide growth factors. EGF family members that bind the same receptor 
are able to stimulate divergent biological responses both in cell culture and in 
vivo. This is analogous to the functional selectivity exhibited by ligands for 
G-protein coupled receptors. Here we review this literature and propose that 
this functional selectivity of EGF family members is due to distinctions in the 
conformation of the liganded receptor and subsequent differences in the sites of 
receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and receptor coupling to signaling effectors. 
We also discuss the roles of divergent ligand activity in establishing and 
maintaining malignant phenotypes. Finally, we discuss the potential of mutant 
EGF family ligands as cancer chemotherapeutics targeted to ErbB receptors.
