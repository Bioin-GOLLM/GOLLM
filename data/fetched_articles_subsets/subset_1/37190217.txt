BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of the bone, 
being most prevalent in childhood and adolescence. Despite recent progress in 
diagnostic methods, histopathology remains the gold standard for disease staging 
and therapy decisions. Machine learning and deep learning methods have shown 
potential for evaluating and classifying histopathological cross-sections.
METHODS: This study used publicly available images of osteosarcoma 
cross-sections to analyze and compare the performance of state-of-the-art deep 
neural networks for histopathological evaluation of osteosarcomas.
RESULTS: The classification performance did not necessarily improve when using 
larger networks on our dataset. In fact, the smallest network combined with the 
smallest image input size achieved the best overall performance. When trained 
using 5-fold cross-validation, the MobileNetV2 network achieved 91% overall 
accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the importance of careful selection of 
network and input image size. Our results indicate that a larger number of 
parameters is not always better, and the best results can be achieved on smaller 
and more efficient networks. The identification of an optimal network and 
training configuration could greatly improve the accuracy of osteosarcoma 
diagnoses and ultimately lead to better disease outcomes for patients.
