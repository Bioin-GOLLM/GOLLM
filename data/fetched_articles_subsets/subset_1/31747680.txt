The current need for novel antibiotics is especially acute for drug-resistant 
Gram-negative pathogens1,2. These microorganisms have a highly restrictive 
permeability barrier, which limits the penetration of most compounds3,4. As a 
result, the last class of antibiotics that acted against Gram-negative bacteria 
was developed in the 1960s2. We reason that useful compounds can be found in 
bacteria that share similar requirements for antibiotics with humans, and focus 
on Photorhabdus symbionts of entomopathogenic nematode microbiomes. Here we 
report a new antibiotic that we name darobactin, which was obtained using a 
screen of Photorhabdus isolates. Darobactin is coded by a silent operon with 
little production under laboratory conditions, and is ribosomally synthesized. 
Darobactin has an unusual structure with two fused rings that form 
post-translationally. The compound is active against important Gram-negative 
pathogens both in vitro and in animal models of infection. Mutants that are 
resistant to darobactin map to BamA, an essential chaperone and translocator 
that folds outer membrane proteins. Our study suggests that bacterial symbionts 
of animals contain antibiotics that are particularly suitable for development 
into therapeutics.
