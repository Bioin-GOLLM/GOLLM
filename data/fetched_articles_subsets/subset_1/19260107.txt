DYT1 dystonia are one of the exceptions in human genetics with its unique and 
recurrent mutation (c.907delGAG). In this rare movement disorder, the mutation 
is associated with incomplete penetrance as well as great clinical variability, 
making this disease a benchmark to search for genetic modifiers. Recently, Risch 
et al. have demonstrated the implication of the rs1801968 SNP in disease 
penetrance. We attempted to replicate this result in an exhaustive DYT1 French 
population with no success. Our results argue that the rs1801968 H allele effect 
is not part of the modifiers in the French population of DYT1 patients and that 
others have to be identified in our population.
