Tetraspanins are a family of proteins possessing four transmembrane domains that 
help in lateral organization of plasma membrane proteins. These proteins 
interact with each other as well as other receptors and signaling proteins, 
resulting in functional complexes called "tetraspanin microdomains." 
Tetraspanins, including CD82, play an essential role in the pathogenesis of 
fungal infections. Dectin-1, a receptor for the fungal cell wall carbohydrate 
β-1,3-glucan, is vital to host defense against fungal infections. The current 
study identifies a novel association between tetraspanin CD82 and Dectin-1 on 
the plasma membrane of Candida albicans-containing phagosomes independent of 
phagocytic ability. Deletion of CD82 in mice resulted in diminished fungicidal 
activity, increased C. albicans viability within macrophages, and decreased 
cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β) at both mRNA and protein level in 
macrophages. Additionally, CD82 organized Dectin-1 clustering in the phagocytic 
cup. Deletion of CD82 modulates Dectin-1 signaling, resulting in a reduction of 
Src and Syk phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species production. CD82 
knockout mice were more susceptible to C. albicans as compared with wild-type 
mice. Furthermore, patient C. albicans-induced cytokine production was 
influenced by two human CD82 single nucleotide polymorphisms, whereas an 
additional CD82 single nucleotide polymorphism increased the risk for candidemia 
independent of cytokine production. Together, these data demonstrate that CD82 
organizes the proper assembly of Dectin-1 signaling machinery in response to C. 
albicans.
