Based on work by Dubochet and others in the 1980s and 1990s, samples for 
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have been vitrified using 
ethane, propane or ethane/propane mixtures. These liquid cryogens have a large 
difference between their melting and boiling temperatures and so can absorb 
substantial heat without formation of an insulating vapor layer adjacent to a 
cooling sample. However, ethane and propane are flammable, they must be 
liquified in liquid nitro-gen immediately before cryo-EM sample preparation, and 
cryocooled samples must be transferred to liquid nitro-gen for storage, 
complicating workflows and increasing the chance of sample damage during 
handling. Experiments over the last 15 years have shown that cooling rates 
required to vitrify pure water are only ∼250 000 K s-1, at the low end of 
earlier estimates, and that the dominant factor that has limited cooling rates 
of small samples in liquid nitro-gen is sample precooling in cold gas present 
above the liquid cryogen surface, not the Leidenfrost effect. Using an automated 
cryocooling instrument developed for cryocrystallography that combines high 
plunge speeds with efficient removal of cold gas, we show that single-particle 
cryo-EM samples on commercial grids can be routinely vitrified using only 
boiling nitro-gen and obtain apoferritin datasets and refined structures with 
2.65 Å resolution. The use of liquid nitro-gen as the primary coolant may allow 
manual and automated workflows to be simplified and may reduce sample stresses 
that contribute to beam-induced motion.
