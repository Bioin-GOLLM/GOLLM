Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 1 (PIK3R1) is believed to function 
as a tumor suppressor, while Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 2 
(PIK3R2) as a tumor driver. However, there is no systematic pan-cancer analysis 
of them. The pan-cancer study comprehensively investigated the gene expression, 
genetic alteration, DNA methylation, and prognostic significance of PIK3R1 and 
PIK3R2 in 33 different tumors based on the TIMER, GEPIA, UALCAN, HPA, 
cBioPortal, and Kaplan-Meier Plotter database. The results indicated that PIK3R1 
is lowly expressed in most tumors while PIK3R2 is highly expressed in most 
tumors, and abnormal gene expression may be related to promoter methylation. 
Moreover, not only mutations, downregulation of PIK3R1 and upregulation of 
PIK3R2 were found to be detrimental to the survival of most cancer patients as 
well. Furthermore, the expression of both PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 was associated with 
the level of immune infiltration in multiple tumors, such as breast invasive 
carcinoma. Our study conducted a comparatively comprehensive analysis of the 
role of PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 in a variety of cancers, contributing to further study 
of their potential mechanisms in cancer occurrence and progression. Our findings 
suggested that PIK3R1 and PIK3R2 could serve as prognostic markers for several 
cancers.
