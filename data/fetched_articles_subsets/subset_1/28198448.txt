A single nucleotide polymorphism of rs1360780 in the FKBP5 gene is associated 
with a predisposition to developing major depressive disorder (MDD). We 
investigated the interactive effects of FKBP5 rs1360780 allelic variants, DNA 
methylation, and the diagnosis of MDD on structural changes of the entire brain. 
One hundred and fourteen patients with MDD and eighty-eight healthy controls 
underwent T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging and FKBP5 rs1360780 
genotyping, including DNA methylation of intron 7. We analyzed the volume of 
cortical and subcortical regions and cortical thickness using FreeSurfer. 
Significant genotype-by-diagnosis interactions were observed for volumes of the 
left pars triangularis, supramarginal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, right 
frontomarginal, and posterior midcingulate gyrus. The T allele was associated 
with significant volume reductions in these brain regions only in the MDD group 
except for the right posterior midcingulate gyrus. FKBP5 DNA methylation showed 
a positive correlation with the thickness of the right transverse frontopolar 
gyrus in the C allele homozygote group. Our findings suggest that the FKBP5 gene 
and its epigenetic changes could have influence on morphologic changes of 
several brain regions involved in emotion regulation, and that this process may 
be associated with the development of MDD.
