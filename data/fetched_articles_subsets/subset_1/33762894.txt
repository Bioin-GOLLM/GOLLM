Aarskog-Scott syndrome is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous rare 
condition caused by a pathogenic variant in the FGD1 gene. A systematic review 
was carried out to analyse the prevalence of clinical manifestations found in 
patients, as well as to evaluate the genotype-phenotype correlation. The results 
obtained show that clinical findings of the craniofacial, orthopaedic, and 
genitourinary tract correspond to the highest scores of prevalence. The authors 
reclassified the primary, secondary, and additional criteria based on their 
prevalence. Furthermore, it was possible to observe, in accordance with previous 
reports, that the reported phenotypes do not present a direct relation to the 
underlying genotypes.
