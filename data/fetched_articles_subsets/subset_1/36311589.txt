OBJECTIVE: Universal health coverage can decrease the magnitude of the 
individual patient's financial burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the 
residual financial hardship from the patients' perspective has not been 
well-studied in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aimed to 
evaluate the residual financial burden in patients with CKD stage 3 to dialysis 
in the "PD First Policy" under Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) in Thailand.
METHODS: This multicenter nationwide cross-sectional study in Thailand enrolled 
1,224 patients with pre-dialysis CKD, hemodialysis (HD), and peritoneal dialysis 
(PD) covered by UCS and other health schemes for employees and civil servants. 
We interviewed patients to estimate the proportion with catastrophic health 
expenditure (CHE) and medical impoverishment. The risk factors associated with 
CHE were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Under UCS, the total out-of-pocket expenditure in HD was over two times 
higher than PD and nearly six times higher than CKD stages 3-4. HD suffered 
significantly more CHE and medical impoverishment than PD and pre-dialysis CKD 
[CHE: 8.5, 9.3, 19.5, 50.0% (p < 0.001) and medical impoverishment: 8.0, 3.1, 
11.5, 31.6% (p < 0.001) for CKD Stages 3-4, Stage 5, PD, and HD, respectively]. 
In the poorest quintile of UCS, medical impoverishment was present in all HD and 
two-thirds of PD patients. Travel cost was the main driver of CHE in HD. In UCS, 
the adjusted risk of CHE increased in PD and HD (OR: 3.5 and 16.3, respectively) 
compared to CKD stage 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite universal coverage, the residual financial burden remained 
high in patients with kidney failure. CHE was considerably lower in PD than HD, 
although the rates remained alarmingly high in the poor. The "PD First' program" 
could serve as a model for other LMICs. However, strategies to minimize 
financial distress should be further developed, especially for the poor.
