The cation, anion, and solvent in the title compound, 
[K(C(18)H(36)N(2)O(6))][Co(C(8)H(12))(C(16)H(10))(2)]·0.5C(5)H(12), are well 
separated. The pentane solvent mol-ecules are found in channels along [100] and 
were modeled as disordered over crystallographic inversion centers. Using the 
mid-points of the coordinated olefins, the angle between the 
C(py)/C(py)-Co-C(py)/C(py) and the C(cod)/C(cod)-Co-C(cod)/C(cod) planes (py is 
pyrene and cod is cyclo-octa-diene) is 67.6 (2)°. Thus, the overall geometry of 
the coordination sphere around cobalt is best described as distorted 
tetra-hedral.
