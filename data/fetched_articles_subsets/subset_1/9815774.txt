Gliomas are tumors of the central nervous system that may be inherited in some 
patients. The gene(s) responsible for the clustering of gliomas in families have 
not yet been identified. Molecular studies of sporadic high-grade gliomas have 
revealed mutations or deletions of the genes encoding the protein kinase 
inhibitors p16(INK4A) and p15(INK4B) in a large proportion of tumors. Moreover, 
those tumors without deletions frequently display gene amplification and/or 
over-expression of mRNA encoding the protein kinase cdk4. We hypothesized that 
germ-line mutations in the p16(INK4A), p15(INK4B), or CDK4 genes might 
contribute to some cases of familial gliomas. To address this issue, we analyzed 
36 kindreds with a predisposition to glial tumors. Genomic DNA from index 
members of these families was screened by PCR-single-strand conformational 
polymorphism analysis. We did not detect any functional mutations in the 
p16(INK4A), p15(INK4B), or CDK4 genes, although two individuals did have a 
previously described A140T polymorphism in p16(INK4A). Thus, despite the 
association between the sporadic forms of high-grade glioma and abnormalities of 
p16(INK4A), p15(INK4B), or CDK4, we found no evidence that germ-line mutations 
in the coding region of these three genes predispose to inherited glial tumors.
