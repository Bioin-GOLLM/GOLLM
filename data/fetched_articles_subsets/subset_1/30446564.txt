Cryptosporidium is an important opportunistic intestinal pathogen for 
immunocompromised individuals and a common cause of diarrhea in young children 
in developing countries. Gastrointestinal epithelial cells play a central role 
in activating and orchestrating host immune responses against Cryptosporidium 
infection, but underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We 
report in this paper that C. parvum infection causes significant alterations in 
long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles in murine intestinal epithelial 
cells. Transcription of a panel of lncRNA genes, including NR_045064, in 
infected cells is controlled by the NF-κB signaling. Functionally, inhibition of 
NR_045064 induction increases parasite burden in intestinal epithelial cells. 
Induction of NR_045064 enhances the transcription of selected defense genes in 
host cells following C. parvum infection. Epigenetic histone modifications are 
involved in NR_045064-mediated transcription of associated defense genes in 
infected host cells. Moreover, the p300/MLL-associated chromatin remodeling is 
involved in NR_045064-mediated transcription of associated defense genes in 
intestinal epithelial cells following C. parvum infection. Expression of 
NR_045064 and associated genes is also identified in intestinal epithelium in 
C57BL/6J mice following phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide or LPS 
stimulation. Our data demonstrate that lncRNAs, such as NR_045064, play a role 
in regulating epithelial defense against microbial infection.
