Strand-seq is a single-cell sequencing technique to finely map sister chromatid 
exchanges (SCEs) and other rearrangements. To analyze these data, we introduce 
BAIT, software which assigns templates and identifies and localizes SCEs. We 
demonstrate BAIT can refine completed reference assemblies, identifying 
approximately 21 Mb of incorrectly oriented fragments and placing over half (2.6 
Mb) of the orphan fragments in mm10/GRCm38. BAIT also stratifies scaffold-stage 
assemblies, potentially accelerating the assembling and finishing of reference 
genomes. BAIT is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/bait/.
