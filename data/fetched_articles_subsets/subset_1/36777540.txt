Plant immunity induction with natural biocontrol compounds is a valuable and 
promising ecofriendly tool that fits with sustainable agriculture and healthy 
food. Despite the agroeconomic significance of wheat, the mechanisms underlying 
its induced defense responses remain obscure. We reveal here, using combined 
transcriptomic, metabolomic and cytologic approach, that the lipopeptide 
mycosubtilin from the beneficial bacterium Bacillus subtilis, protects wheat 
against Zymoseptoria tritici through a dual mode of action (direct and indirect) 
and that the indirect one relies mainly on the priming rather than on the 
elicitation of plant defense-related mechanisms. Indeed, the molecule primes the 
expression of 80 genes associated with sixteen functional groups during the 
early stages of infection, as well as the accumulation of several flavonoids 
during the period preceding the fungal switch to the necrotrophic phase. 
Moreover, genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and ABA-associated 
signaling pathways are regulated, suggesting a role of this phytohormone in the 
indirect activity of mycosubtilin. The priming-based bioactivity of mycosubtilin 
against a biotic stress could result from an interaction of the molecule with 
leaf cell plasma membranes that may mimic an abiotic stress stimulus in wheat 
leaves. This study provides new insights into induced immunity in wheat and 
opens new perspectives for the use of mycosubtilin as a biocontrol compound 
against Z. tritici.
