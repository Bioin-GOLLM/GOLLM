BACKGROUND: Men are more likely than women to have subthreshold overeating 
disorders. Lifestyle plays a role as a determinant, while chronotype is an 
emerging factor. Chronotype explains the natural preferences of wakefulness and 
activity throughout the day: evening chronotypes (E-Types), those most 
productive in the evening, have been linked with unhealthy dietary patterns and 
a higher propensity to substance addiction than morning types (M-Types).
METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study on 750 overweight or obese 
adults (70% females, 48 ± 10 years, BMI 31.7 ± 5.8 kg/m2). The Binge-Eating 
Scale, the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (YFAS 2.0), the reduced 
Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ), and the MEDAS questionnaire were 
used to assess binge eating, food addiction, chronotype, and adherence to the 
Mediterranean diet, respectively.
RESULTS: No differences in BES binge-eating and FA food-addiction scores 
occurred between chronotypes, but we found significant interactions between sex 
× rMEQ score. While women showed the same prevalence for binge eating and food 
addiction across all chronotypes, binge eating and food addiction risk increased 
with reducing rMEQ score in men, indicating that being male and E-Type increases 
the risk association of binge eating and/or food addiction prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: chronotype is associated with binge eating and food addiction in 
men, emphasizing the link between chronobiology and sex differences as 
determinants in appetite and eating behaviour dysregulation and in overweight 
and obesity.
