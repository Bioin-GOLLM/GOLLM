Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant tumor 
syndrome that may be caused by mutations in the MEN1 gene on 11q13. Loss of 
function of the tumor suppressor gene MEN1 leads to synchronous or metachronous 
appearance of neuroendocrine tumors arising from neuroendocrine cells of the 
parathyroid and pituitary glands, the duodenum and pancreatic islets, and other 
endocrine organs such as the adrenal cortex. We here present a patient with MEN1 
who developed hyperparathyroidism, multiple well differentiated functionally 
inactive neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and an adrenal carcinoma. We 
describe a new mutation at codon 443 in the coding region of exon 9 in the MEN1 
gene, where a cytosine residue was exchanged for adenosine (TCC > TAC) and, 
consequently, serine for tyrosine (p.Ser443Tyr; c.1328C > A). [corrected] Also, 
we provide clinical data that may add to the genotype-phenotype discussion. We 
conclude that the novel mutation in the MEN1 gene described herein was 
clinically relevant.
