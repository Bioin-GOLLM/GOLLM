BACKGROUND: Erlotinib is presently the first line treatment for non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) active 
mutation. An increasing number of evidences show that the treatment efficacy and 
toxicities are considerably heterogeneous among individuals. Hence, it is 
necessary to find biological predictors for further individualized treatment of 
erlotinib in NSCLC patients.
METHODS: Our present study enrolled 87 cases of NSCLC patients who had been 
administrated erlotinib with a fixed dose (150 mg/d). Eleven polymorphisms in 
seven genes of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters were genotyped and the 
steady state trough concentrations were also determined.
RESULTS: There were significant variances in the steady-state erlotinib trough 
plasma concentrations, ranging from 315.6 ng/ml to 4479.83 ng/ml. Erlotinib 
steady state trough concentration was remarkably lower in current smoking 
patients. The steady state trough concentration of GG in rs1048943 of CYP1A1 was 
significantly higher than that of AA allele carriers. The polymorphism of CYP1A2 
was significantly associated with the severity of skin rash, and the development 
of diarrhea was associated with SNPs in ABCB1 and CYP3A5. We also observed that 
GG allele in CYP1A1 was accompanied with a longer PFS in our study.
CONCLUSION: A large variability of erlotinib steady state trough concentration 
was found among Chinese Han population. SNPs in CYP1A1 appeared to influence the 
steady state trough concentration of erlotinib. Correlation between CYP1A2 
polymorphisms and severity of skin rash was observed, together with the 
correlation between the development of diarrhea and SNPs in ABCB1 and CYP3A5.
