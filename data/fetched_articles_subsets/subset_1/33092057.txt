African swine fever virus (ASFV) is currently the most dreaded infectious 
disease affecting the global swine production industry. There is no commercial 
vaccine available, making the culling of infected animals the current solution 
to control outbreaks. Effective experimental vaccines have been developed by 
deleting virus genes associated with virulence. Deletion of the ASFV 9GL gene 
(∆9GL) has resulted in the attenuation of different ASFV strains, although the 
degree of attenuation varies across isolates. Here, we investigated the 
possibility of the increased safety of the experimental vaccine strain 
ASFV-G-Δ9GL by deleting two additional virus genes involved in pathogenesis, 
CD2v, a CD2 like viral encoded gene from the EP402R open reading frame (ORF), 
and C-type lectin-like viral gene, encoded from the EP153R ORF. Two new 
recombinant viruses were developed, ASFV-G-Δ9GL/ΔCD2v and 
ASFV-G-Δ9GL/ΔCD2v/ΔEP153R, harboring two and three gene deletions, respectively. 
ASFV-G-Δ9GL/ΔCD2v/ΔEP153R, but not ASFV-G-Δ9GL/ΔCD2v, had a decreased ability to 
replicate in vitro in swine macrophage cultures when compared with parental 
ASFV-G-Δ9GL. Importantly, ASFV-G-Δ9GL/ΔCD2v and ASFV-G-Δ9GL/ΔCD2v/ΔEP153R 
induced almost undetectable viremia levels when inoculated into domestic pigs 
and failed to protect them against challenge with parental virulent 
ASFV-Georgia, while ASFV-G-Δ9GL offered robust protection during challenge. 
Therefore, the deletion of CD2-like and C-type lectin-like genes significantly 
decreased the protective potential of ASFV-G-Δ9GL as a vaccine candidate. This 
study constitutes an example of the unpredictability of genetic manipulation 
involving the simultaneous deletion of multiple genes from the ASFV genome.
