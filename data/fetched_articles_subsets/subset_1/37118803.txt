BACKGROUND: Furmonertinib (AST2818) is a brain penetrant pan-epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting both EGFR 
sensitizing mutations and T790M mutation. We report the pooled central nervous 
system (CNS) efficacy data of furmonertinib in patients with EGFR T790M mutated 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from two phase 2 studies.
METHODS: This was a pooled, post-hoc analysis of two phase 2 studies 
(NCT03127449 [phase 2a study of furmonertinib], NCT03452592 [phase 2b study of 
furmonertinib]). In the phase 2a study, patients received furmonertinib 40 mg, 
80 mg, 160 mg, or 240 mg orally once daily. In the phase 2b study, all patients 
received furmonertinib 80 mg orally once daily. CNS efficacy of furmonertinib 
was analyzed in patients with baseline CNS lesions by an independent review 
center per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1.
RESULTS: A total of 132 patients with baseline CNS metastases were included in 
this analysis. In 52 patients with measurable CNS lesions, CNS objective 
response rates were zero (0/1), 65% (22/34), 85% (11/13), and 25% (1/4), and CNS 
disease control rates were zero (0/1), 97% (33/34), 100% (13/13), and 100% (4/4) 
in the 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, and 240 mg orally once daily group, respectively. 
In patients with measurable or non-measurable CNS lesions, median CNS 
progression-free survival was 2.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-8.3), 
11.6 months (95% CI 8.3-13.8), 19.3 months (95% CI 5.5-not available [NA]), and 
not reached (95% CI 2.8 months-NA) in the 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, and 240 mg 
orally once daily group, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Furmonertinib showed promising CNS efficacy in doses of 80 mg 
orally once daily or higher in patients with EGFR T790M mutated NSCLC.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Both studies were registered on ClinicalTrial.gov. The phase 
2a study was registered with NCT03127449 on April 25, 2017; The phase 2b study 
was registered with NCT03452592 on March 2, 2018.
