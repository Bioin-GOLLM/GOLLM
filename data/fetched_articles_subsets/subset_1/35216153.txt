Glioblastoma (GB) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor among adults and 
currently there is no effective treatment. This aggressive tumor grows fast and 
spreads through the brain causing death in 15 months. GB cells display a high 
mutation rate and generate a heterogeneous population of tumoral cells that are 
genetically distinct. Thus, the contribution of genes and signaling pathways 
relevant for GB progression is of great relevance. We used a Drosophila model of 
GB that reproduces the features of human GB and describe the upregulation of the 
circadian gene cry in GB patients and in a Drosophila GB model. We studied the 
contribution of cry to the expansion of GB cells and the neurodegeneration and 
premature death caused by GB, and we determined that cry is required for GB 
progression. Moreover, we determined that the PI3K pathway regulates cry 
expression in GB cells, and in turn, cry is necessary and sufficient to promote 
Myc accumulation in GB. These results contribute to understanding the mechanisms 
underlying GB malignancy and lethality, and describe a novel role of Cry in GB 
cells.
