Cry j 1 is a major allergen present in Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) 
pollens. Peptides with the core sequence of KVTVAFNQF from Cry j 1 ('pCj1') bind 
to HLA-DP5 and activate Th2 cells. In this study, we noticed that Ser and Lys at 
positions -2 and -3, respectively, in the N-terminal flanking (NF) region to 
pCj1 are conserved well in HLA-DP5-binding allergen peptides. A competitive 
binding assay showed that the double mutation of Ser(-2) and Lys(-3) to Glu 
[S(P-2)E/K(P-3)E] in a 13-residue Cry j 1 peptide (NF-pCj1) decreased its 
affinity for HLA-DP5 by about 2-fold. Similarly, this double mutation reduced, 
by about 2-fold, the amount of NF-pCj1 presented on the surface of mouse 
antigen-presenting dendritic cell line 1 (mDC1) cells stably expressing HLA-DP5. 
We established NF-pCj1-specific and HLA-DP5-restricted CD4+ T-cell clones from 
HLA-DP5 positive cedar pollinosis (CP) patients, and analyzed their IL-2 
production due to the activation of mouse TG40 cells expressing the cloned 
T-cell receptor by the NF-pCj1-presenting mDC1 cells. The T-cell activation was 
actually decreased by the S(P-2)E/K(P-3)E mutation, corresponding to the 
reduction in the peptide presentation by this mutation. In contrast, the 
affinity of NF-pCj1·HLA-DP5 for the T-cell receptor was not affected by the 
S(P-2)E/K(P-3)E mutation, as analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. Considering 
the positional and side-chain differences of these NF residues from previously 
reported T-cell activating sequences, the mechanisms of enhanced T-cell 
activation by Ser(-2) and Lys(-3) of NF-pCj1 may be novel.
