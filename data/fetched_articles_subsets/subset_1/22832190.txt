BACKGROUND/AIMS: Knowledge about the abundance and distribution of CFTR protein 
glycoforms in native lung tissue is scarce. For upcoming studies with correctors 
and potentiators for CFTR it is important to get more information about mutant 
CFTR protein biochemistry. Target for novel treatment is the most afflicted 
organ in cystic fibrosis (CF), the lung.
METHODS: Lung tissue sampled from patients with CF and non-CF donors prior to 
lung transplantation was examined for CFTR-immunoreactive signals by immunoblot. 
Quantitation of the immunoreactive signals was carried out by densitometry.
RESULTS: The complex-glycosylated and mannose-rich CFTR isoforms were present in 
all non-CF specimens, whereas no or only the immature CFTR isoform was visible 
in CF samples. Whereas some complex-glycosylated CFTR was often present in 
rectal biopsies of F508del homozygous subjects, no mature CFTR was detectable in 
CF lungs at the stage of terminal respiratory insufficiency.
CONCLUSION: Immunoblot analysis of CFTR in lung tissue is feasible, but in 
context of the upcoming studies of CFTR correctors and potentiators rectal 
biopsies seem to be a more appropriate choice because of their safe and 
repeatable excision.
