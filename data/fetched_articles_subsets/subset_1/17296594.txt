Given that many cases of thrombosis do not have a clear cause, a 
myeloproliferative disease could be involved. We investigated the V617F mutation 
of the JAK2 gene in 295 patients with thrombosis. Only one case was positive. 
Therefore, the study of this mutation is not necessary in all patients with 
idiopathic thrombosis.
