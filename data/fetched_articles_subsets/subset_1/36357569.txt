Immune checkpoint therapies, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
blockade, have shown remarkable clinical benefit in many cancers by restoring 
the function of exhausted T cells. Hence, the identification of novel PD-L1 
regulators and the development of their inhibition strategies have significant 
therapeutic advantages. Here, we conducted pooled shRNA screening to identify 
regulators of membrane PD-L1 levels in lung cancer cells targeting druggable 
genes and cancer drivers. We identified WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 3 
(WNK3) as a novel positive regulator of PD-L1 expression. The kinase-dead WNK3 
mutant failed to elevate PD-L1 levels, indicating the involvement of its kinase 
domain in this function. WNK3 perturbation increased cancer cell death in cancer 
cell-immune cell coculture conditions and boosted the secretion of cytokines and 
cytolytic enzymes, promoting antitumor activities in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. 
WNK463, a pan-WNK inhibitor, enhanced CD8+ T-cell-mediated antitumor activity 
and suppressed tumor growth as a monotherapy as well as in combination with a 
low-dose anti-PD-1 antibody in the MC38 syngeneic mouse model. Furthermore, we 
demonstrated that the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-JUN pathway underlies 
WNK3-mediated transcriptional regulation of PD-L1. Our findings highlight that 
WNK3 inhibition might serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer 
immunotherapy through its concurrent impact on cancer cells and immune cells.
