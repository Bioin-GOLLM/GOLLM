We describe the de novo design of an allosterically regulated protein, which 
comprises two tightly coupled domains. One domain is based on the DF (Due Ferri 
in Italian or two-iron in English) family of de novo proteins, which have a 
diiron cofactor that catalyzes a phenol oxidase reaction, while the second 
domain is based on PS1 (Porphyrin-binding Sequence), which binds a synthetic 
Zn-porphyrin (ZnP). The binding of ZnP to the original PS1 protein induces 
changes in structure and dynamics, which we expected to influence the catalytic 
rate of a fused DF domain when appropriately coupled. Both DF and PS1 are 
four-helix bundles, but they have distinct bundle architectures. To achieve 
tight coupling between the domains, they were connected by four helical linkers 
using a computational method to discover the most designable connections capable 
of spanning the two architectures. The resulting protein, DFP1 (Due Ferri 
Porphyrin), bound the two cofactors in the expected manner. The crystal 
structure of fully reconstituted DFP1 was also in excellent agreement with the 
design, and it showed the ZnP cofactor bound over 12 Å from the dimetal center. 
Next, a substrate-binding cleft leading to the diiron center was introduced into 
DFP1. The resulting protein acts as an allosterically modulated phenol oxidase. 
Its Michaelis-Menten parameters were strongly affected by the binding of ZnP, 
resulting in a fourfold tighter Km and a 7-fold decrease in kcat These studies 
establish the feasibility of designing allosterically regulated catalytic 
proteins, entirely from scratch.
