Most nonsignalized T-shaped intersections permit U-turn movements, which make 
the traffic conditions of intersection complex. In this paper, a new cellular 
automaton (CA) model is proposed to characterize the traffic flow at the 
intersection of this type. In present CA model, new rules are designed to avoid 
the conflicts among different directional vehicles and eliminate the gridlock. 
Two kinds of performance measures (i.e., flux and average control delay) for 
intersection are compared. The impacts of U-turn movements are analyzed under 
different initial conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that (i) the 
average control delay is more practical than flux in measuring the performance 
of intersection, (ii) U-turn movements increase the range and degree of high 
congestion, and (iii) U-turn movements on the different direction of main road 
have asymmetrical influences on the traffic conditions of intersection.
