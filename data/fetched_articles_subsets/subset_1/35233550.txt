The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) omicron variant 
emerged in November 2021 and consists of several mutations within the spike. We 
use serum from mRNA-vaccinated individuals to measure neutralization activity 
against omicron in a live-virus assay. At 2-4 weeks after a primary series of 
vaccinations, we observe a 30-fold reduction in neutralizing activity against 
omicron. Six months after the initial two-vaccine doses, sera from naive 
vaccinated subjects show no neutralizing activity against omicron. In contrast, 
COVID-19-recovered individuals 6 months after receiving the primary series of 
vaccinations show a 22-fold reduction, with the majority of the subjects 
retaining neutralizing antibody responses. In naive individuals following a 
booster shot (third dose), we observe a 14-fold reduction in neutralizing 
activity against omicron, and over 90% of subjects show neutralizing activity. 
These findings show that a third dose is required to provide robust neutralizing 
antibody responses against the omicron variant.
