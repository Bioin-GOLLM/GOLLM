BACKGROUND: We aimed to build a novel model with golgi apparatus related genes 
(GaGs) signature and relevant clinical parameters for predicting 
progression-free interval (PFI) after surgery for papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(PTC).
METHODS: We performed a bioinformatic analysis of integrated PTC datasets with 
the GaGs to identify differentially expressed GaGs (DE-GaGs). Then we generated 
PFI-related DE-GaGs and established a novel GaGs based signature. After that, we 
validated the signature on multiple external datasets and PTC cell lines. 
Further, we conducted uni- and multivariate analyses to identify independent 
prognostic characters. Finally, we established a signature and clinical 
parameters-based nomogram for predicting the PFI of PTC.
RESULTS: We identified 260 DE-GaGs related to PFI in PTC. The functional 
enrichment analysis showed that the DE-MTGs were associated with an essential 
oncogenic glycoprotein biosynthetic process. Consequently, we established and 
optimized a novel 11 gene signature that could distinguish patients with poorer 
prognoses and predicted PFI accurately. The novel signature had a C-index of 
0.78, and the relevant nomogram had a C-index of 0.79. Also, it was closely 
related to the pivotal clinical characters of and anaplastic potential in 
datasets and PTC cell lines. And the signature was confirmed a significant 
independent prognostic factor in PTC. Finally, we built a nomogram by including 
the signature and relevant clinical factors. Validation analysis showed that the 
nomogram's efficacy was satisfying in predicting PTC's PFI.
CONCLUSION: The GaGs signature and nomogram were closely associated with PTC 
prognosis and may help clinicians improve the individualized prediction of PFI, 
especially for high-risk patients after surgery.
