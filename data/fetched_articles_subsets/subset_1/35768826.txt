BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, seasonal 
influenza activity declined globally and remained below previous seasonal 
levels, but intensified in China since 2021. Preventive measures to COVID-19 
accompanied by different epidemic characteristics of influenza in different 
regions of the world. To better respond to influenza outbreaks under the 
COVID-19 pandemic, we analyzed the epidemiology, antigenic and genetic 
characteristics, and antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses in the 
mainland of China during 2020-2021.
METHODS: Respiratory specimens from influenza like illness cases were collected 
by sentinel hospitals and sent to network laboratories in Chinese National 
Influenza Surveillance Network. Antigenic mutation analysis of influenza virus 
isolates was performed by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Next-generation 
sequencing was used for genetic analyses. We also conducted molecular 
characterization and phylogenetic analysis of circulating influenza viruses. 
Viruses were tested for resistance to antiviral medications using phenotypic 
and/or sequence-based methods.
RESULTS: In the mainland of China, influenza activity recovered in 2021 compared 
with that in 2020 and intensified during the traditional influenza winter 
season, but it did not exceed the peak in previous years. Almost all viruses 
isolated during the study period were of the B/Victoria lineage and were 
characterized by genetic diversity, with the subgroup 1A.3a.2 viruses currently 
predominated. 37.8% viruses tested were antigenically similar to reference 
viruses representing the components of the vaccine for the 2020-2021 and 
2021-2022 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons. In addition, China has a unique 
subgroup of 1A.3a.1 viruses. All viruses tested were sensitive to neuraminidase 
inhibitors and endonuclease inhibitors, except two B/Victoria lineage viruses 
identified to have reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: Influenza activity increased in the mainland of China in 2021, and 
caused flu season in the winter of 2021-2022. Although the diversity of 
influenza (sub)type decreases, B/Victoria lineage viruses show increased genetic 
and antigenic diversity. The world needs to be fully prepared for the 
co-epidemic of influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) virus globally.
