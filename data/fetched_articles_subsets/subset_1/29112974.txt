We prospectively studied the consequences of extensive antibiotic treatment on 
faecal carriage of antibiotic-resistant enterobacteria in a cohort of children 
with cystic fibrosis (CF) and a cohort of children with cancer compared to 
healthy children with no or low antibiotic exposure. The study was conducted in 
Norway in a low resistance prevalence setting. Sixty longitudinally collected 
faecal samples from children with CF (n = 32), 88 samples from children with 
cancer (n = 45) and 127 samples from healthy children (n = 70) were examined. A 
direct MIC-gradient strip method was used to detect resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
by applying Etest strips directly onto agar-plates swabbed with faecal samples. 
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data were analysed to identify resistance 
mechanisms in 28 multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolates. The prevalence 
of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin 
was low in all the study groups. At inclusion the prevalence of 
ampicillin-resistant E. coli and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant E. coli 
in the CF group compared to healthy controls was 58.6% vs. 28.4% (p = 0.005) and 
48.3% vs. 14.9% (p = 0.001), respectively, with a similar prevalence at the end 
of the study. The prevalence of resistant enterobacteria was not significantly 
different in the children with cancer compared to the healthy children, not even 
at the end of the study when the children with cancer had been treated with 
repeated courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Children with cancer were mainly 
treated with intravenous antibiotics, while the CF group mainly received peroral 
treatment. Our observations indicate that the mode of administration of 
antibiotics and the general level of antimicrobial resistance in the community 
may have an impact on emergence of resistance in intestinal enterobacteria 
during antibiotic treatment. The WGS analyses detected acquired resistance genes 
and/or chromosomal mutations that explained the observed phenotypic resistance 
in all 28 multidrug-resistant E. coli isolates examined.
