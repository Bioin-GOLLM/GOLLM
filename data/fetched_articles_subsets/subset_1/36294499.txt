CIREL, a prospective, Europe-wide, observational study aimed to assess the 
real-world feasibility and tolerability of irinotecan-based transarterial 
chemoembolization (LP-irinotecan TACE) for unresectable colorectal cancer liver 
metastases with regard to the treatment plan and adverse events (AEs). CIREL 
enrolled 152 eligible patients (≥18 years) with liver-only or dominant 
metastases treated with LP-irinotecan TACE following a multidisciplinary tumor 
board decision. Data were prospectively collected for baseline, the number of 
planned and performed sessions, and technical information and safety according 
to CTCAE 4.03/5.0. Results from 351 analyzed treatment sessions showed technical 
success for 99% of sessions, and 121 patients (79%) completed all planned 
sessions. Further, 60% of sessions were performed using opioids, 4% 
intra-arterial anesthetics, and 25% both. Additionally, 60% of patients 
experienced at least one peri-interventional AE of any grade; 8% of grade 3−4. 
Occurrence of AEs was related to larger liver-involvement (p < 0.001), bi-lobar 
disease (p = 0.002), and larger beads (p < 0.001). Using corticosteroids 
together with antiemetics showed reduced and lower grade vomiting (p = 0.01). 
LP-irinotecan TACE was tolerated well and had a high proportion of completed 
treatment plans. This minimally invasive locoregional treatment can be used 
together with concomitant systemic therapy or ablation.
