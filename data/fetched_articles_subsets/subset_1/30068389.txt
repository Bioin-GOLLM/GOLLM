The development of insoluble, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of 
the microtubule-associated protein tau is a defining feature of tauopathies, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidence suggests that tau 
pathology co-localizes with RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are known markers 
for stress granules (SGs). Here we used proteomics to determine how the network 
of tau binding proteins changes with disease in the rTg4510 mouse, and then 
followed up with immunohistochemistry to identify RNA binding proteins that 
co-localize with tau pathology. The tau interactome networks revealed striking 
disease-related changes in interactions between tau and a multiple RBPs, and 
biochemical fractionation studies demonstrated that many of these proteins 
including hnRNPA0, EWSR1, PABP and RPL7 form insoluble aggregates as tau 
pathology develops. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse and human brain 
tissues suggest a model of evolving pathological interaction, in which RBPs 
co-localize with pathological phospho-tau but occur adjacent to larger 
pathological tau inclusions. We suggest a model in which tau initially interacts 
with RBPs in small complexes, but evolves into isolated aggregated inclusions as 
tau pathology matures.
