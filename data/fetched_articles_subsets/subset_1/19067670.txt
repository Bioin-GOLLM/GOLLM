AIMS: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is the major endotoxin signalling receptor of 
the innate immune system and is required for efficient recognition of bacterial 
infections. Here, we analysed a possible association between the TLR4 variant 
Asp299Gly and disease outcome in children with invasive meningococcal disease.
METHODS: In total, 197 children with invasive meningococcal disease were 
analysed for the TLR4 Asp299Gly variant. Genotyping results were correlated with 
mortality, the frequency of ventilation support, application of inotropic 
substances, skin grafting, and limb loss.
RESULTS: The overall Asp299Gly allele frequency was 9.4%. Detection of a 
heterozygous Asp299Gly TLR4 mutation was significantly associated with fatal 
outcome (non-survivor group: 31.6% vs. survivor group: 12.1%; p = 0.021) and was 
even more pronounced in patients with disease onset less than 24 months of age 
(non-survivor group: 42.8% vs. survivor group: 10.2%; p = 0.006). In this age 
group, ventilation support was also more frequent in patients with the Asp299Gly 
genotype (37.5% vs. 6.2%).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the heterozygous TLR4 Asp299Gly genotype is 
associated with an increased mortality in children with invasive meningococcal 
disease.
