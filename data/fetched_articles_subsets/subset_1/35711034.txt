BACKGROUND: Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) use can lead to early detection 
of periprocedural complications and may improve patient outcomes by providing 
real-time visualization of catheter location and the treatment area during 
cardiac ablation (CA) for atrial fibrillation (AF).
OBJECTIVE: Examine complications and 12-month healthcare use among patients with 
AF undergoing CA with versus without ICE use during the procedure in a 
real-world setting.
METHODS: The 2015-2020 IBM MarketScan® Database was used to identify non-elderly 
adults (age 18-64 years) undergoing CA for AF. Patients were classified into 
ICE/non-ICE groups based on the presence or absence of ICE procedure codes. 
Patients in each group were matched on study covariates using propensity scores. 
Peri-procedural complications, 12-month cardiovascular (CV) or AF-related 
inpatient admission, repeat CA, and cardioversion were compared using a Cox 
proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: 1371 patients were identified in each study cohort (ICE and non-ICE) 
after propensity matching. Patients who had CA with ICE had a significantly 
lower rate of complications than those without (2.9% vs. 5.8%; p < .001). The 
risk of complications was 50% lower with ICE use (hazard ratio [HR] 0.50; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.72). For assessment of 12-month healthcare 
utilization, 1250 patients were identified in each cohort after propensity 
matching. ICE use was associated with a 36% lower risk of 12-month repeat 
ablation (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.49-0.83). No differences in CV- or AF-related 
inpatient admission and cardioversion were observed.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with AF, the use of ICE during an ablation procedure 
was associated with lower incidence of complications and repeat ablation.
