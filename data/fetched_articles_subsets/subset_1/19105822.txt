BACKGROUND: The alpha1A-adrenergic receptor (alpha1A-AR) regulates the cardiac 
and peripheral vascular system through sympathetic activation. Due to its 
important role in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure, we aimed 
to investigate the association between the Arg347Cys polymorphism in the 
alpha1A-AR gene and blood pressure phenotypes, in a large sample of Brazilians 
from an urban population.
METHODS: A total of 1568 individuals were randomly selected from the general 
population of the Vitória City metropolitan area. Genetic analysis of the 
Arg347Cys polymorphism was conducted by polymerase chain reaction/restriction 
fragment length polymorphism. We have compared cardiovascular risk variables and 
genotypes using ANOVA, and Chi-square test for univariate comparisons and 
logistic regression for multivariate comparisons.
RESULTS: Association analysis indicated a significant difference between 
genotype groups with respect to diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.04), but not 
systolic blood pressure (p = 0.12). In addition, presence of the Cys/Cys 
genotype was marginally associated with hypertension in our population (p = 
0.06). Significant interaction effects were observed between the studied genetic 
variant, age and physical activity. Presence of the Cys/Cys genotype was 
associated with hypertension only in individuals with regular physical activity 
(odds ratio = 1.86; p = 0.03) or younger than 45 years (odds ratio = 1.27; p = 
0.04).
CONCLUSION: Physical activity and age may potentially play a role by disclosing 
the effects of the Cys allele on blood pressure. According to our data it is 
possible that the Arg347Cys polymorphism can be used as a biomarker to disease 
risk in a selected group of individuals.
