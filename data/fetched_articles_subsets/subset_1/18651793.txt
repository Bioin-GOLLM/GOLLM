Spinal cord injury often results in permanent functional impairment. Neural stem 
cells present in the adult spinal cord can be expanded in vitro and improve 
recovery when transplanted to the injured spinal cord, demonstrating the 
presence of cells that can promote regeneration but that normally fail to do so 
efficiently. Using genetic fate mapping, we show that close to all in vitro 
neural stem cell potential in the adult spinal cord resides within the 
population of ependymal cells lining the central canal. These cells are 
recruited by spinal cord injury and produce not only scar-forming glial cells, 
but also, to a lesser degree, oligodendrocytes. Modulating the fate of ependymal 
progeny after spinal cord injury may offer an alternative to cell 
transplantation for cell replacement therapies in spinal cord injury.
