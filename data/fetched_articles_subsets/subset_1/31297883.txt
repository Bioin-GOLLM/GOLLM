OBJECTIVE: Given a proposed role for PD-L1+ and IL-10-producing B-cell subsets 
in promoting certain cancers, we sought to characterize the frequency and 
phenotype of B cells in patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms 
(MPNs) and the influence of ruxolitinib and interferon-α2 therapy.
METHODS: We analyzed B-cell frequencies and phenotype in patients with MPNs 
(n = 107), before and during treatment with ruxolitinib (n = 29), interferon-α2 
(n = 21), or the two drugs in combination (COMBI; n = 42) and healthy donors 
(HDs; n = 52) using flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Myelofibrosis patients had lower lymphocyte counts and proportions of B 
cells than patients with essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera and HDs. 
The B-cell count correlated inversely with JAK2-V617F allele burden and spleen 
size and increased after ruxolitinib or COMBI treatment. The proportions of 
PD-L1+ B cells and PD-1+ B cells were significantly higher in patients with 
myelofibrosis or polycythemia vera than in HDs and decreased during ruxolitinib 
and COMBI treatment. The proportions of TNF-α+ and IL-6+ B cells were elevated 
in myelofibrosis patients. The proportion of IL-6+ B cells decreased, and the 
proportion of IL-10+ B cells increased during ruxolitinib treatment.
CONCLUSION: B-cell frequency and phenotype were altered in MPN patients. 
Ruxolitinib therapy had marked effects on both frequency and phenotype.
