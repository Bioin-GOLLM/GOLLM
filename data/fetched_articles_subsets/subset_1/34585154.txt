Archaea-infecting viruses are morphologically and genomically among the most 
diverse entities. Unfortunately, they are also fairly understudied due to a lack 
of efficient genetic tools. Here, we present a detailed protocol for the 
CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing of the virus SIRV2 infecting the genus 
Sulfolobus, which could easily be adapted to other archaeal viruses. This 
protocol also includes the procedure for endogenous viral protein purification 
and identification, allowing for assessing the molecular mechanisms behind virus 
life cycle and virus-host interactions. For complete details on the use and 
execution of this protocol, please refer to Mayo-Muñoz et al. (2018) and 
Bhoobalan-Chitty et al. (2019).
