Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a 
high incidence of skin cancers. Yeast RAD30 encodes a DNA polymerase involved in 
the error-free bypass of ultraviolet (UV) damage. Here it is shown that XP 
variant (XP-V) cell lines harbor nonsense or frameshift mutations in hRAD30, the 
human counterpart of yeast RAD30. Of the eight mutations identified, seven would 
result in a severely truncated hRad30 protein. These results indicate that 
defects in hRAD30 cause XP-V, and they suggest that error-free replication of UV 
lesions by hRad30 plays an important role in minimizing the incidence of 
sunlight-induced skin cancers.
