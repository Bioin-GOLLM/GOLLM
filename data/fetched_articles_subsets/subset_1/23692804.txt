BACKGROUND: Olmsted syndrome is a rare congenital skin disorder presenting with 
periorifical hyperkeratotic lesions and mutilating palmoplantar keratoderma, 
which is often associated with infections of the keratotic area. A recent study 
identified de novo mutations causing constitutive activation of TRPV3 as a cause 
of the keratotic manifestations of Olmsted syndrome.
METHODS: Genetic, clinical and immunological profiling was performed on a case 
study patient with the clinical diagnosis of Olmsted syndrome.
RESULTS: The patient was found to harbour a previously undescribed 1718G-C 
transversion in TRPV3, causing a G573A point mutation. In depth clinical and 
immunological analysis found multiple indicators of immune dysregulation, 
including frequent dermal infections, inflammatory infiltrate in the affected 
skin, hyper IgE production and elevated follicular T cells and eosinophils in 
the peripheral blood.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first comprehensive assessment of the 
immunological features of Olmsted syndrome. The systemic phenotype of hyper IgE 
and persistent eosinophilia suggest a primary or secondary role of immunological 
processes in the pathogenesis of Olmsted syndrome, and have important clinical 
consequences with regard to the treatment of Olmsted syndrome patients.
