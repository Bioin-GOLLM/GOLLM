BACKGROUND: Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1), an 
inherited liver disease caused by mutations in ATP8B1, progresses to severe 
cholestasis with a sustained intractable itch. Currently, no effective therapy 
has been established for PFIC1. Decreased function of the bile salt export pump 
(BSEP) in hepatocytes is suggested to be responsible for the severe cholestasis 
observed in PFIC1. We found a previously unidentified pharmacological effect of 
4-phenylbutyrate (4PB) that increases the expression and function of BSEP. Here, 
we tested 4PB therapy in three patients with PFIC1.
METHODS: The therapeutic potency of 4PB in these patients was tested by oral 
administration of this drug with gradually increasing dosage (200, 350, and 
500 mg/kg/day) for 6 months. Biochemical, histological, and clinical data were 
collected.
RESULTS: 4PB therapy had no beneficial effect on the patients' liver functions, 
as assessed by biochemical and histological analyses, despite an increase in 
hepatic BSEP expression. However, therapy with 4PB at a dosage of 350 or 
500 mg/kg/day significantly relieved the intractable itch. Serum levels of 
potential pruritogens in cholestasis were much higher than the reference ranges 
during the 4PB therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: 4PB therapy may be a new medication for patients with intractable 
cholestatic pruritus and may improve quality of life for patients and their 
families.
