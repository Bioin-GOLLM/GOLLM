Hymenoptera venom allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis in adults and 
the second-most frequent in children. The proper diagnosis of this 
life-threatening allergy remains a challenge. This review focuses on the current 
knowledge regarding diagnostics of Hymenoptera venom allergy. The paper includes 
a brief description of the representatives of Hymenoptera order and the 
composition of their venoms. Then, diagnostic tests for allergy to Hymenoptera 
venom are described. Common diagnostic problems, especially double positivity in 
tests for IgE antibodies specific to honeybee and wasp venom, are also 
discussed. Special attention is paid to the search for new diagnostic 
capabilities using modern methodologies. Multidimensional molecular analysis 
offers an opportunity to characterize changes in body fluids associated with 
Hymenoptera venom allergy and yields a unique insight into the cell status. 
Despite recent developments in the diagnostics of Hymenoptera venom allergy, new 
testing methodologies are still needed to answer questions and doubts we have.
