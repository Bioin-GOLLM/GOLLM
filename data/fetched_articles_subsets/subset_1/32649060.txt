The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) revolutionized the 
approach to cell therapy in regenerative medicine. Reprogramming of somatic 
cells into an embryonic-like pluripotent state provides an invaluable resource 
of patient-specific cells of any lineage. Implementation of procedures and 
protocols adapted to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements is 
critical to ensure robust and consistent high-quality iPSC manufacturing. The 
technology developed at Allele Biotechnology for iPSC generation under cGMP 
conditions is a powerful platform for derivation of pluripotent stem cells 
through a footprint-free, feeder-free, and xeno-free reprogramming method. The 
cGMP process established by Allele Biotechnology entails fully cGMP compliant 
iPSC lines where the entire manufacturing process, from tissue collection, cell 
reprogramming, cell expansion, cell banking and quality control testing are 
adopted. Previously, we described in this series of publications how to create 
iPSCs using mRNA only, and how to do so under cGMP conditions. In this article, 
we describe in detail how to culture, examine and storage cGMP-iPSCs using 
reagents, materials and equipment compliant with cGMP standards. © 2020 The
