L-asparaginase is an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the asparagine to aspartic 
acid and ammonia. L-asparaginase is widely used in the treatment of acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and other cancers. Here, for the first time, the 
effects of a novel yeast L-asparaginase from Yarrowia lipolytica were studied on 
human lung (A549) and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines as the solid cancer cell 
lines in terms of cell growth and metastasis inhibition. Functional analysis 
showed the L-asparagine deprivation mediated anti-proliferation effects by 
apoptosis induction and changes in the expression of target genes involved in 
apoptosis and migration pathways. The qRT-PCR analysis showed the higher 
expression levels of pro-apoptosis genes, including Bax, P53, caspase 3, caspase 
8, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic gene in treated cells. On the 
other hand, there was no increase in ROS production in the treated cells. 
However, L-asparaginase treatment was able to significantly induce autophagy 
activation in A549 cells. Besides, wound healing assay showed that 
L-asparaginase could considerably inhibit the migration of A549 and MCF7 cells. 
Taken together, our results suggested that Yarrowia lipolytica L-asparaginase 
might be considered for enzyme therapy against breast and lung cancers.
