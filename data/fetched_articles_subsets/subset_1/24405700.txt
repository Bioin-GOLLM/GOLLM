BACKGROUND: With the development of sequencing technologies, more and more 
sequence variants are available for investigation. Different classes of variants 
in the human genome have been identified, including single nucleotide 
substitutions, insertion and deletion, and large structural variations such as 
duplications and deletions. Insertion and deletion (indel) variants comprise a 
major proportion of human genetic variation. However, little is known about 
their effects on humans. The absence of understanding is largely due to the lack 
of both biological data and computational resources.
RESULTS: This paper presents a new indel functional prediction method HMMvar 
based on HMM profiles, which capture the conservation information in sequences. 
The results demonstrate that a scoring strategy based on HMM profiles can 
achieve good performance in identifying deleterious or neutral variants for 
different data sets, and can predict the protein functional effects of both 
single and multiple mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper proposed a quantitative prediction method, HMMvar, to 
predict the effect of genetic variation using hidden Markov models. The HMM 
based pipeline program implementing the method HMMvar is freely available at
