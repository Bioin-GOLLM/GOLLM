Ikaros zinc finger transcription factors are important regulators of the gene 
programs underlying the development of hematopoietic cell lineages. The family 
consists of five members: Ikaros, Helios, Aiolos, Eos, and Pegasus, which engage 
in both homo- and heterotypic intrafamilial interactions to exert diverse 
functional effects. Pioneering studies focused on the role of these factors in 
early lymphoid development, as their absence resulted in severe defects in 
lymphocyte populations. More recent work has now begun to define nuanced, 
stage-specific roles for Ikaros family members in the differentiation and 
function of mature T, B, and innate lymphoid cell populations including natural 
killer (NK) cells. The precise transcriptional mechanisms by which these factors 
function, both independently and collaboratively, is an area of active 
investigation. However, several key themes appear to be emerging regarding the 
pathways influenced by Ikaros family members, including the end-to-end 
regulation of cytokine signaling. Here, we review roles for Ikaros factors in 
lymphoid cell development, differentiation, and function, including a discussion 
of the current understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms they employ and 
considerations for the future study of this important transcription factor 
family.
