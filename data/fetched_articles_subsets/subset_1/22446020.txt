BACKGROUND: KRAS testing is mandatory if anti-EGFR therapy is considered in 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). In addition, BRAF mutations 
seem to be an important negative prognostic factor. The aim of this study is to 
establish the concordance of KRAS and BRAF mutational status in paired biopsy 
and resection specimens of primary CRC using several analytic methods.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks of 126 CRC patients. KRAS codon 
12/13 and BRAF V600E mutational status was assessed using high resolution 
melting (HRM), direct sequencing (DS) of the HRM polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
product. In addition, the Therascreen Amplification Refractory Mutation System 
(ARMS)-Scorpion KRAS assay and BRAF pyrosequencing were employed; both assays 
claim to require less tumour cells in comparison with DS.
RESULTS: KRAS and BRAF were found to be mutually exclusive. Mutation frequencies 
were 33.9% for KRAS, and for BRAF 19.0%, respectively. Concordance of KRAS 
mutational status between biopsy and resection specimens was 97.4% (ARMS), 98.4% 
(DS) and 99.2% (HRM), respectively. For BRAF concordance was 98.4% (Pyro, DS) 
and 99.2% (HRM).
CONCLUSIONS: KRAS and BRAF mutational status of endoscopic biopsies and 
resection specimens of CRC showed a >95% concordance. Endoscopic biopsies can be 
confidently used for molecular analysis.
