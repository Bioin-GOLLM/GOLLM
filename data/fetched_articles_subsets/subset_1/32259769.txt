Mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial carrier protein SLC25A46 are 
known to cause optic atrophy associated with peripheral neuropathy and 
congenital pontocerebellar hypoplasia. We found novel biallelic SLC25A46 
mutations (p.H137R, p.A401Sfs*17) in a patient with Parkinson's disease and 
optic atrophy. Screening of six unrelated patients with parkinsonism and optic 
atrophy allowed us to identify two additional mutations (p.A176V, p.K256R) in a 
second patient. All identified variants are predicted likely pathogenic and 
affect very conserved protein residues. These findings suggest for the first 
time a possible link between Parkinson's Disease and SLC25A46 mutations. 
Replication in additional studies is needed to conclusively prove this link.
