PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of acupuncture for improving the pregnancy 
rate of COH rats from the viewpoint of regulating the opening time of the 
implantation window and endometrial receptivity.
METHODS: Experimental rats were randomly divided into normal group (N), model 
group (M) and acupuncture group(A), and samples were collected on Day 4, 5 and 6 
after mating. COH rats were treated with acupuncture at SP6, LR3, and ST36 once 
a day for 7 times. The pinopodes were observed under a scanning electron 
microscope. Serum estrogen and progesterone levels were measured via ELISA. The 
protein and mRNA levels of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), 
leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), integrin β3, vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) in the endometrium were 
evaluated via West-blot, immunohistochemistry, and PCR.
RESULTS: Compared with group N, the pregnancy rate of group M was significantly 
decreased (P<0.05), and the abnormal serum hormone levels and implantation 
window advancement were observed. Compared with group M, the pregnancy rate of 
group A was significantly increased (P<0.05), the supraphysiological serum 
progesterone levels were restored to normalcy (P<0.05), and the advanced 
implantation window was restored to a certain extent. Further, the abnormal ER, 
PR, LIF, integrin β3, VEGF, and FGF-2 expression levels of the endometrium got 
recovered to varying degrees.
CONCLUSION: Acupuncture may restore the estrogen and progesterone balance in COH 
rats and the forward shift of the implantation window to a certain extent, 
improving the endometrial receptivity and finally improving the pregnancy rate 
of COH rats.
