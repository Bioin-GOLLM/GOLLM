OBJECTIVE: To compare the ultrasonography and pathology features between 
children and adolescents with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
METHODS: A total of 53 patients who were surgically diagnosed with childhood or 
adolescent PTC between 2017 and 2022 were included in this study. The 
pre-operative ultrasonography, post-operative histology, and molecular and 
clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: No differences were observed in composition, echogenicity, and shape 
using ultrasonography. Moreover, there was a significantly higher rate of 
extrathyroidal extension, punctate echogenic foci, and lymph node metastases in 
children compared to adolescents. The molecular analysis showed that BRAFV600E 
mutations are the most prevalent abnormality in adolescent PTC (12/20, 60.0%). 
However, they are less in childhood PTC (7/23, 30.4%). In addition, using 
next-generation sequencing, three cases with oncogenic fusion (one TRIM33-RET 
case, one CCDC6-RET case, and one STRN-ALK case) were identified in childhood 
PTC.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of extrathyroidal extension, punctate echogenic foci, 
and lymph node metastases were higher in childhood PTC, while BRAFV600E 
mutations were higher in adolescent PTC.
