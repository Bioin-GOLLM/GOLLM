PURPOSE: The clinical objective of this trial was to evaluate gefitinib in 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that had progressed despite prior 
treatment. Serial tumor biopsies were performed when possible and analyzed for 
activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. 
Serial serum samples were measured for amphiregulin and transforming growth 
factor-alpha (TGFalpha).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients were randomly assigned to 
receive gefitinib 250 or 500 mg orally once a day. One hundred ten patients were 
assessable for clinical efficacy. Biologic evaluation was performed on paired 
tumor samples from 28 patients and correlated with clinical outcome.
RESULTS: Median progression-free survival was 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.1 
months) and 4-month progression-free survival rate was 13% +/- 5%. One patient 
achieved a radiographic partial response (RR = 1%; 95% CI, 0.01% to 5%). Median 
survival was 6.3 months (95% CI, 5.1 to 8.2 months). The most common adverse 
events were skin rash, diarrhea, and fatigue. In the biopsy cohort, expression 
of total or activated EGFR, activated Akt, activated MAP-kinase, or Ki67 did not 
decrease following 1 week of gefitinib. However, a trend toward decreased 
post-treatment levels of activated Akt and Ki67 was observed in patients with a 
PFS higher than the median, although these did not reach the .05 level of 
significance.
CONCLUSION: Gefitinib is inactive as a single agent in patients with previously 
treated colorectal cancer. In tumor samples, gefitinib did not inhibit 
activation of its proximal target, EGFR. Trends were observed for inhibition of 
downstream regulators of cellular survival and proliferation in patients 
achieving longer progression-free survival.
