Eukaryotic cells use cytoskeletal motor proteins to transport many different 
intracellular cargos. Numerous kinesins and myosins have evolved to cope with 
the various transport needs that have arisen during eukaryotic evolution. 
Surprisingly, a single cytoplasmic dynein (a minus end-directed microtubule 
motor) carries out similarly diverse transport activities as the many different 
types of kinesin. How is dynein coupled to its wide range of cargos and how is 
it spatially and temporally regulated? The answer could lie in the several 
multifunctional adaptors, including dynactin, lissencephaly 1, nuclear 
distribution protein E (NUDE) and NUDE-like, Bicaudal D, Rod-ZW10-Zwilch and 
Spindly, that regulate dynein function and localization.
