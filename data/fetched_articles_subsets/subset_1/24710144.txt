Gene conversion is one of the major mutational mechanisms involved in the DNA 
sequence evolution of duplicated genes. It contributes to create unique patters 
of DNA polymorphism within species and divergence between species. A typical 
pattern is so-called concerted evolution, in which the divergence between 
duplicates is maintained low for a long time because of frequent exchanges of 
DNA fragments. In addition, gene conversion affects the DNA evolution of 
duplicates in various ways especially when selection operates. Here, we review 
theoretical models to understand the evolution of duplicates in both neutral and 
non-neutral cases. We also explain how these theories contribute to interpreting 
real polymorphism and divergence data by using some intriguing examples.
