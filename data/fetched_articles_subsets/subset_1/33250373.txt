Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome are two syndromes whose 
molecular bases remain poorly understood. The phenotypes of both syndromes 
overlap with other syndromes that have a clear genetic background, in particular 
RYR1-related malignant hyperthermia. Through a literature review, performed 
according to the PRISMA guidelines, we aimed to report the clinical features of 
both syndromes, and the results of genetic testing performed. 10 case series and 
99 case reports were included, comprising 134 patients. A male predominance of 
58% was found. The median age was 35 (range 4-84) years. Eight patients 
experienced recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis. Genetic analysis was performed 
in eleven patients (8%), revealing four RYR1 variants, three likely benign 
(p.Asp849Asn, p.Arg4645Gln, p.Arg4645Gln) and one variant of uncertain 
significance (p.Ala612Thr). This review underlines that a subset of patients 
with neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome develop recurrent 
episodes of rhabdomyolysis. This recurrent pattern suggests a possible 
underlying (genetic) susceptibility. However, the genetic background of 
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome has only been investigated 
to a very limited degree so far. The increasing availability of next generation 
sequencing offers an opportunity to identify potentially associated genetic 
backgrounds, especially in patients with recurrent episodes or a positive family 
history.
