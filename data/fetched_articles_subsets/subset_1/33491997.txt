Gingival fibromatosis with distinctive facies presents a rare clinical picture. 
It is characterized by gingival fibromatosis in conjunction with some 
craniofacial dysmorphic features such as relative macrocephaly, bushy eyebrows, 
synophrys, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, flattened nasal 
bridge, hypoplastic nares, cupid-bow mouth and a high palate. Autosomal 
recessive inheritance has been suggested. However, to date, no causative gene 
has been reported. Herein, we report a case presenting with the typical findings 
of this rare genetic syndrome. A homozygous c.1855C>T (p.Gln619Ter) mutation in 
the PTPN14 gene was identified.
