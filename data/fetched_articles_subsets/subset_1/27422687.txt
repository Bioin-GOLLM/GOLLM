BACKGROUND: Porokeratosis (PK, MIM 175800) is a chronic autosomal dominant 
cutaneous keratinization disorder, which has a wide variety of clinical 
manifestations.
OBJECTIVES: We analysed the molecular basis of 10 families and 12 sporadic cases 
with different subtypes of porokeratosis in the Chinese population.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Mutation 
screening was performed by direct sequencing of exons and flanking intron-exon 
boundaries for the entire coding region of four mevalonate pathway genes and 
SLC17A9 gene.
RESULTS: We detected three novel mutations and seven previously described 
mutations by direct sequence analysis of the PCR products. Mutations p.Phe249Ser 
and p.Asn292Ser in mevalonate decarboxylase (MVD) were the most common mutations 
in this PK cohort; their presence was 27.3% and 13.6% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study extended the mutation spectrum of PK in the Chinese Han 
population and provided further evidence for the genetic basis of PK. We first 
identified MVD simultaneously responsible for porokeratosis palmaris et 
plantaris disseminate development and confirmed the genotype-phenotype 
correlations.
