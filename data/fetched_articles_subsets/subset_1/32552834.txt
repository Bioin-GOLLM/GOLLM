BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic histone methyltransferases 2 (EHMT2 or G9A) has been 
regarded as a potential target for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therapy. 
This study investigated the regulatory roles of G9A in tumorigenesis and 
stemness in NSCLC. We isolated and enriched tumor-initiating cells (TIC) from 
surgically resected NSCLC tissues by FACS and sphere formation assays. We then 
knocked down G9A using shRNA and carried out genome-wide 850K methylation array 
and RNA sequencing analyses. We carried out in vivo tumorigenecity asssay using 
mice xenografts and examined G9A interactions with its novel target using 
chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP).
RESULTS: We identified 67 genes hypomethylated and 143 genes upregulated 
following G9A knockdown of which 43 genes were both hypomethylated and 
upregulated. We selected six genes (CDYL2, DPP4, SP5, FOXP1, STAMBPL1, and 
ROBO1) for validation. In addition, G9A expression was higher in TICs and 
targeting G9a by shRNA knockdown or by selective inhibitor UNC0642 significantly 
inhibited the expression of cancer stem cell markers and sphere forming 
capacity, in vitro proliferation, and in vivo growth. Further, transient 
overexpression of FOXP1, a protein may promote normal stem cell differentiation, 
in TICs resulted in downregulation of stem cell markers and sphere forming 
capacity and cell proliferation in vitro indicating that the genes we identified 
are directly regulated by G9A through aberrant DNA methylation and subsequent 
expression. Similarly, ChIP assay has shown that G9a interacts with its target 
genes through H3K9me2 and downregulation of H3K9me2 following G9a knockdown 
disrupts its interaction with its target genes.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that G9A is involved in lung cancer stemness 
through epigenetic mechanisms of maintaining DNA methylation of multiple lung 
cancer stem cell genes and their expression. Further, targeting G9A or its 
downstream genes could be a novel therapeutic approach in treating NSCLC 
patients.
