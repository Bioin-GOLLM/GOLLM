BACKGROUND: The activity of epithelial lactase (LCT) associates with a 
polymorphism 13910 bp upstream the LCT-encoding gene (LCT-13910C>T). The 
relationship between LCT-13910C>T polymorphism and risk for colorectal cancer is 
unclear.
AIMS: We examined the relationship between the LCT-13910C>T polymorphism causing 
lactose intolerance and risk for colorectal cancer/polyps onset in the Italian 
population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 793 subjects (306 with colorectal cancer, 176 with polyps 
and 311 controls) were genotyped for the LCT-13910C>T variant by TaqMan real 
time-PCR.
RESULTS: Lactose malabsorption linked to the CC genotype did not associate with 
an increased risk for either colorectal cancer (OR=1.041; 95% CI=0.751-1.442; 
p=0.868) or polyps (OR=0.927; 95% CI=0.630-1.363; p=0.769). There was no 
association with colorectal cancer/polyps site. 60% of the subjects overall bore 
the CC genotype.
CONCLUSION: In the Italian population the LCT-13910C>T polymorphism is not 
associated to the risk for colorectal cancer or polyps.
