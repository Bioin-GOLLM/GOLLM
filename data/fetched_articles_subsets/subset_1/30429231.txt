AIMS: To investigate the relationship between the miR-130a polymorphism rs731384 
and coronary artery disease (CAD) and to further explore the molecular mechanism 
of the pathogenesis of CAD, an observational single-center study was conducted.
METHOD: A total of 876 subjects were recruited in the present study. Four 
milliliters of venous blood was drawn after 12 h of fasting to perform 
biochemical assays. CAD patients and controls were distinguished by coronary 
angiography. Rs731384 was genotyped on the Agena MassARRAY system according to 
the manufacturer's user guide. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 
16.0 software.
RESULTS: The study found that the plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) 
(P=0.006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P=0.030), apolipoprotein 
A (ApoA) (P=0.038), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) (P=0.022) distributed 
differently in patients with various alleles. Additionally, the AA genotype of 
rs731384 was found to be a protective factor against CAD in a recessive model 
(AA:AG+GG, odds ratio (OR) = 0.408, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 
0.171-0.973, P=0.043). A significant association was found between the 
gene-environment interaction and CAD risk. The AA genotype along with 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level ≥ 1.325 mmol/l significantly 
decreased the CAD risk (AA:AG+GG, OR = 0.117, 95% CI = 0.023-0.588, P=0.009).
CONCLUSION: The mutant AA genotype of rs731384 seems to be a protective factor 
against CAD, and rs731384 plays an important role in the human metabolism of 
plasma lipids.
