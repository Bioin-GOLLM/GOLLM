Does [99mTc]-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) soft tissue 
uptake allow the identification of patients with the diagnosis of cardiac 
transthyretin-related (ATTR) amyloidosis with higher risk for polyneuropathy?

BACKGROUND: With the introduction of several drugs for the therapy of 
transthyretin-related amyloidosis (ATTR) which slow down the disease, early 
detection of polyneuropathy (PNP) is becoming increasingly of interest. 
[99mTc]-3,3-Diphosphono-1,2-Propanodicarboxylic Acid (DPD) bone scintigraphy, 
which is used for the diagnosis of cardiac (c)ATTR, can possibly make an 
important contribution in the identification of patients at risk for PNP.
METHODS: Fifty patients with cATTR, who underwent both planar whole-body DPD 
scintigraphy and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were retrospectively evaluated. 
A subgroup of 22 patients also underwent quantitative SPECT/CT of the thorax 
from which Standardized Uptake Values (SUVpeak) in the subcutaneous fat tissue 
of the left axillar region were evaluated.
RESULTS: The Perugini score was significantly increased in patients with cATTR 
and additional diagnosis of PNP compared to patients without (2.51 ± 0.51 vs 
2.13 ± 0.52; P = 0.03). Quantitative SPECT/CT revealed that DPD uptake in the 
subcutaneous fat of the left axillar region was significantly increased in cATTR 
patients with compared to patients without (1.36 ± 0.60 vs 0.74 ± 0.52; 
P = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that DPD bone scintigraphy is a useful tool for 
identification of patients with cATTR and a risk for PNP due to increased DPD 
soft tissue uptake.
