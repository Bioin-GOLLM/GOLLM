Acquired chemoresistance presents a major clinical impediment, which is an 
urgent problem to be solved. Interestingly, myeloma cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) and 
folate receptor expression levels are higher in chemotherapy-resistant patients 
than in pretreatment patients. In this study, a multifunctional folic acid 
(FA)-targeting core-shell structure is presented for simultaneous delivery of 
shMCL-1 and paclitaxel (PTX). The transfection efficiency of shMCL-1 with the 
FA-targeting delivery system is higher than with a nontargeting delivery system 
in Skov3 and A2780T cells. The FA-targeting system significantly inhibits cell 
growth, blocks cell cycles, and promotes apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro. The 
mechanisms involved in inhibiting growth are related to Bcl-2/Bax and 
cdc2/Cyclin B1 pathways. An analysis of RNA sequencing suggests that shMCL-1 
reverses chemoresistance through regulating genes such as regulator of 
chromosome condensation 2 (RCC2). The synergetic effect of shMCL-1 and PTX 
effectively inhibits tumor growth in both PTX-resistant and normal cancer models 
by inducing tumor apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, and limiting tumor 
angiogenesis. The study results indicate that a FA-targeting delivery system 
combining shMCL-1 with PTX can simultaneously target tumor sites and restore the 
sensitivity of chemotherapy-resistant cancer to PTX. These findings have 
important implications for patients with normal or PTX-resistant cancer.
