Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) is an important regulator of lipoproteins 
by inhibiting both lipoprotein and endothelial lipases. It has been intensively 
investigated as a drug target for the treatment of dyslipidemia. In the present 
study, a modified small interfering RNA (siRNA) conjugated with GalNAc ANGsiR10 
was characterized by in vivo and in vitro studies for its effect on ANGPTL3 
silencing, the reduction of plasma triglycerides (TGs), and cholesterol levels 
in disease models. The results showed that ANGsiR10 displayed a significant and 
long-lasting efficacy in reducing blood TG and cholesterol levels in both mice 
and monkeys. Remarkably, the maximal reductions of plasma TG levels in the 
hApoC3-Tg mice, a model with high TG levels, and the spontaneous dyslipidemia 
model of rhesus monkey were 96.3% and 67.7%, respectively, after a single dose 
of ANGsiR10, with long-lasting effects up to 15 weeks. The cholesterol levels 
were also reduced in response to treatment, especially the non-HDL-c level, 
without altering the ApoA/ApoB ratio. This study showed that ANGsiR10 is 
effective in treating dyslipidemia and is worth further development.
