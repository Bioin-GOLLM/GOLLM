The title compound, C(14)H(12)N(2), was synthesized by the reaction of 
4-methyl-N-(2-nitro-benz-yl)aniline with tin(II) chloride dihydrate in ethanol 
at 313 K. The indazole ring system is almost planar with a dihedral angle of 
1.58 (10)° between the rings, whereas the plane of the attached p-tolyl 
substituent shows a dihedral angle of 46.26 (5)° with respect to the indazole 
core.
