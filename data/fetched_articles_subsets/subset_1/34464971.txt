Human centromeres are mainly composed of alpha satellite DNA hierarchically 
organized as higher-order repeats (HORs). Alpha satellite dynamics is shown by 
sequence homogenization in centromeric arrays and by its transfer to other 
centromeric locations, for example, during the maturation of new centromeres. We 
identified during prenatal aneuploidy diagnosis by fluorescent in situ 
hybridization a de novo insertion of alpha satellite DNA from the centromere of 
chromosome 18 (D18Z1) into cytoband 15q26. Although bound by CENP-B, this locus 
did not acquire centromeric functionality as demonstrated by the lack of 
constriction and the absence of CENP-A binding. The insertion was associated 
with a 2.8-kbp deletion and likely occurred in the paternal germline. The site 
was enriched in long terminal repeats and located ∼10 Mbp from the location 
where a centromere was ancestrally seeded and became inactive in the common 
ancestor of humans and apes 20-25 million years ago. Long-read mapping to the 
T2T-CHM13 human genome assembly revealed that the insertion derives from a 
specific region of chromosome 18 centromeric 12-mer HOR array in which the 
monomer size follows a regular pattern. The rearrangement did not directly 
disrupt any gene or predicted regulatory element and did not alter the 
methylation status of the surrounding region, consistent with the absence of 
phenotypic consequences in the carrier. This case demonstrates a likely rare but 
new class of structural variation that we name "alpha satellite insertion." It 
also expands our knowledge on alphoid DNA dynamics and conveys the possibility 
that alphoid arrays can relocate near vestigial centromeric sites.
