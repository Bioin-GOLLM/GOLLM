Promoting axon regeneration in the central and peripheral nervous system is of 
clinical importance in neural injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Both pro- 
and antiregeneration factors are being identified. We previously reported that 
the Rtca mediated RNA repair/splicing pathway restricts axon regeneration by 
inhibiting the nonconventional splicing of Xbp1 mRNA under cellular stress. 
However, the downstream effectors remain unknown. Here, through transcriptome 
profiling, we show that the tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP) 
ringmaker/ringer is dramatically increased in Rtca-deficient Drosophila sensory 
neurons, which is dependent on Xbp1. Ringer is expressed in sensory neurons 
before and after injury, and is cell-autonomously required for axon 
regeneration. While loss of ringer abolishes the regeneration enhancement in 
Rtca mutants, its overexpression is sufficient to promote regeneration both in 
the peripheral and central nervous system. Ringer maintains microtubule 
stability/dynamics with the microtubule-associated protein futsch/MAP1B, which 
is also required for axon regeneration. Furthermore, ringer lies downstream from 
and is negatively regulated by the microtubule-associated deacetylase HDAC6, 
which functions as a regeneration inhibitor. Taken together, our findings 
suggest that ringer acts as a hub for microtubule regulators that relays 
cellular status information, such as cellular stress, to the integrity of 
microtubules in order to instruct neuroregeneration.
