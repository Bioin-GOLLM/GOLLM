OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic causes of Shabbir syndrome in two patients of 
Pakistani origin.
METHODS: In the present study, we have investigated a Pakistani family with two 
affected members segregating Laryngo-onycho-cutaneous (LOC) syndrome. The 
patients were diagnosed as suspected cases of LOC based on phenotypes including 
abnormal larynx, nails, and hyperpigmentation in patients' eyes. Genetic 
investigation was done by performing whole exome sequencing (WES) using DNA of 
the patients. Sanger sequencing was performed to validate WES findings and 
segregation analysis in the family.
RESULTS: Data analysis of exomes and Sanger sequencing of patients revealed a 
homozygous one base pair duplication (NM_000227.6; LAMA3; c.151dup; 
p.Val51GlyfsTer4) in LAMA3 in the patients. Parents of the patients were 
heterozygous for the identified variant.
CONCLUSION: Previously, the same variant has been found in most of the Pakistani 
Punjabi patients affected with LOC. Therefore, Pakistani Punjabi families 
affected with Shabbir Syndrome may be screened for c.151dup variant in LAMA3 
using targeted sequencing. Sanger sequencing is a cost-effective and time-saving 
technique as compared to whole exome/genome sequencing. Hence, developing 
ethnicity-specific LAMA3 targeted molecular diagnostic test would be 
cost-effective. Further, the study would assist in carrier testing and prenatal 
diagnosis of the affected families.
