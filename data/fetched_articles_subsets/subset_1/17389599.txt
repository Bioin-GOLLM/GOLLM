One familial form of the neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding 
copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD-1). This study provides in vivo evidence 
that normally occurring oxidative modification to SOD-1 promotes aggregation and 
toxicity of mutant proteins. The oxidation of Trp-32 was identified as a normal 
modification being present in both wild-type enzyme and SOD-1 with the 
disease-causing mutation, G93A, isolated from erythrocytes. Mutating Trp-32 to a 
residue with a slower rate of oxidative modification, phenylalanine, decreased 
both the cytotoxicity of mutant SOD-1 and its propensity to form cytoplasmic 
inclusions in motor neurons of dissociated mouse spinal cord cultures.
