BACKGROUND: Rather than a Janus Kinase 2 inhibitor (ruxolitinib), a specific 
thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR) inhibitor would be more specific for the 
treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms due to TpoR mutations.
OBJECTIVE: A cell-based phenotypic approach to identify specific TpoR inhibitors 
was implemented and a library of 505,483 small molecules was screened for 
inhibitory effects on cells transformed by TpoR mutants.
RESULTS: Among the identified hits are two analogs of 3-(4-piperidinyl) indole. 
The analogs showed about five-fold preferential inhibition of cell viability 
towards Ba/F3 cells expressing the TpoR W515L mutation compared to the parental 
cells. There was no significant difference in inhibition of cell viability 
between the TpoR wild type and the TpoR W515L mutant cells. Preferential 
inhibition of viability was observed in Ba/F3 cells expressing erythropoietin 
receptor (EpoR) when stimulated with Epo compared to stimulation with 
interleukin-3 (IL3). The indole analog inhibited ex vivo colony formations of 
primary bone marrow cells from heterozygous JAK2 V617F knock-in mice. Drug 
combination treatment study was performed using ruxolitinib and the indole 
analog. Drug synergistic effects were observed when cells were stimulated to 
proliferate through both the IL3 and TpoR pathways. Our compound specifically 
targets monoamine receptors in the rhodopsin-like receptor family of G 
protein-coupled receptor.
CONCLUSION: This screen has identified a monoamine receptor inhibitor that can 
inhibit viability of cells with active TpoR or EpoR signalings. Drug synergism 
with ruxolitib is demonstrated.
