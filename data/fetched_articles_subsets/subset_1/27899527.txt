Agonists targeting the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) have been promising 
therapeutic candidates because of their efficacy for treating intractable itch 
and relieving pain. Unlike typical opioid narcotics, KOR agonists do not produce 
euphoria or lead to respiratory suppression or overdose. However, they do 
produce dysphoria and sedation, side effects that have precluded their clinical 
development as therapeutics. KOR signaling can be fine-tuned to preferentially 
activate certain pathways over others, such that agonists can bias signaling so 
that the receptor signals through G proteins rather than other effectors such as 
βarrestin2. We evaluated a newly developed G protein signaling-biased KOR 
agonist in preclinical models of pain, pruritis, sedation, dopamine regulation, 
and dysphoria. We found that triazole 1.1 retained the antinociceptive and 
antipruritic efficacies of a conventional KOR agonist, yet it did not induce 
sedation or reductions in dopamine release in mice, nor did it produce dysphoria 
as determined by intracranial self-stimulation in rats. These data demonstrated 
that biased agonists may be used to segregate physiological responses downstream 
of the receptor. Moreover, the findings suggest that biased KOR agonists may 
present a means to treat pain and intractable itch without the side effects of 
dysphoria and sedation and with reduced abuse potential.
