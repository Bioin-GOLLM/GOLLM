AIMS: Inverse relationships have been described between the largely genetically 
determined levels of serum/plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
and fasting insulin. Here, we aimed to evaluate the nature of these 
relationships with respect to causality.
METHODS: We tested whether we could replicate the recent negative findings on 
causality between Lp(a) and T2D by employing the Mendelian randomization (MR) 
approach using cross-sectional data from three independent cohorts, Berlin Aging 
Study II (BASE-II; n = 2012), LIFE-Adult (n = 3281) and LIFE-Heart (n = 2816). 
Next, we explored another frequently discussed hypothesis in this context: 
Increasing insulin levels during the course of T2D disease development inhibits 
hepatic Lp(a) synthesis and thereby might explain the inverse Lp(a)-T2D 
association. We used two fasting insulin-associated variants, rs780094 and 
rs10195252, as instrumental variables in MR analysis of n = 4937 individuals 
from BASE-II and LIFE-Adult. We further investigated causality of the 
association between fasting insulin and Lp(a) by combined MR analysis of 12 
additional SNPs in LIFE-Adult.
RESULTS: While an Lp(a)-T2D association was observed in the combined analysis 
(meta-effect of OR [95% CI] = 0.91 [0.87-0.96] per quintile, p = 1.3x10-4), we 
found no evidence of causality in the Lp(a)-T2D association (p = 0.29, fixed 
effect model) when using the variant rs10455872 as the instrumental variable in 
the MR analyses. Likewise, no evidence of a causal effect of insulin on Lp(a) 
levels was found.
CONCLUSIONS: While these results await confirmation in larger cohorts, the 
nature of the inverse Lp(a)-T2D association remains to be elucidated.
