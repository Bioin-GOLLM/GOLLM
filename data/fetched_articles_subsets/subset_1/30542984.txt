PURPOSE: Tamoxifen is widely used to reduce the risk of breast cancer (BC) 
recurrence and extend disease-free survival among women with estrogen-sensitive 
breast cancers. Tamoxifen efficacy is thought to be attributable to its active 
metabolite, which is formed through a reaction catalyzed by the P450 enzyme, 
CYP2D6. Inhibition of tamoxifen metabolism as a result of germline genetic 
variation and/or use of CYP2D6-inhibiting medications ("inhibitors") is 
hypothesized to increase the risk of adverse BC outcomes among women taking 
tamoxifen.
METHODS: The present cohort study of 960 women diagnosed with early-stage BC 
between 1993 and 1999 examined the association between concomitant use of CYP2D6 
inhibitors and adjuvant tamoxifen and the risk of adverse BC outcomes 
(recurrence, second primary BC, BC mortality), both overall and according to 
CYP2D6 metabolic phenotype.
RESULTS: Six or more months of CYP2D6 inhibitor use concomitant with tamoxifen 
was not associated with any appreciable increase in risk of recurrence or second 
primary BC or BC mortality, and there was no clear evidence of variation by 
CYP2D6 metabolic phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the relatively few other large, 
population-based studies conducted to date that have not observed an increased 
risk of adverse BC outcomes associated with CYP2D6 inhibition.
