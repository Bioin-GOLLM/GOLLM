The deletion of the metabolizing Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1) gene has 
been associated with multiple cancers, metabolic and autoimmune disorders, as 
well as drug response. It is unusually common, with allele frequency reaching up 
to 75% in some human populations. Such high allele frequency of a derived allele 
with apparent impact on an otherwise conserved gene is a rare phenomenon. To 
investigate the evolutionary history of this locus, we analyzed 310 genomes 
using population genetics tools. Our analysis revealed a surprising lack of 
linkage disequilibrium between the deletion and the flanking single nucleotide 
variants in this locus. Tests that measure extended homozygosity and rapid 
change in allele frequency revealed signatures of an incomplete sweep in the 
locus. Using empirical approaches, we identified the Tanuki haplogroup, which 
carries the GSTM1 deletion and is found in approximately 70% of East Asian 
chromosomes. This haplogroup has rapidly increased in frequency in East Asian 
populations, contributing to a high population differentiation among continental 
human groups. We showed that extended homozygosity and population 
differentiation for this haplogroup is incompatible with simulated neutral 
expectations in East Asian populations. In parallel, we found that the Tanuki 
haplogroup is significantly associated with the expression levels of other GSTM 
genes. Collectively, our results suggest that standing variation in this locus 
has likely undergone an incomplete sweep in East Asia with regulatory impact on 
multiple GSTM genes. Our study provides the necessary framework for further 
studies to elucidate the evolutionary reasons that maintain 
disease-susceptibility variants in the GSTM1 locus.
