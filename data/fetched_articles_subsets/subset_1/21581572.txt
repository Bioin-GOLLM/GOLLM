The title N-heterocyclic carbene derivative, C(23)H(33)N(4) (+)·Cl(-), has been 
synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, (1)H and (13)C NMR, IR 
spectroscopy and a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. Ions of the title 
compound are linked by three C-H⋯Cl inter-actions. The seven-membered 
1,3-diazepane ring has a form inter-mediate between twist-chair and twist-boat.
