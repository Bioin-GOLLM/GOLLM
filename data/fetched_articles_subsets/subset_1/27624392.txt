BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have revealed a link between 
essential tremor (ET) and the gene SLC1A2, which encodes excitatory amino acid 
transporter type 2 (EAAT2). We explored EAAT biology in ET by quantifying EAAT2 
and EAAT1 levels in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, and expanded our prior 
analysis of EAAT2 levels in the cerebellar cortex.
OBJECTIVE: To quantify EAAT2 and EAAT1 levels in the cerebellar dentate nucleus 
and cerebellar cortex of ET cases vs.
METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry to quantify EAAT2 and EAAT1 levels in the 
dentate nucleus of a discovery cohort of 16 ET cases and 16 controls. 
Furthermore, we quantified EAAT2 levels in the dentate nucleus in a replicate 
cohort (61 ET cases, 25 controls). Cortical EAAT2 levels in all 77 ET cases and 
41 controls were quantified.
RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, dentate EAAT2 levels were 1.5-fold higher in 
16 ET cases vs. 16 controls (p = 0.007), but EAAT1 levels did not differ 
significantly (p = 0.279). Dentate EAAT2 levels were 1.3-fold higher in 61 ET 
cases vs. 25 controls in the replicate cohort (p = 0.022). Cerebellar cortical 
EAAT2 levels were 20% and 40% lower in ET cases vs. controls in the discovery 
and the replicate cohorts (respective p values = 0.045 and < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: EAAT2 expression is enhanced in the ET dentate nucleus, in contrast 
to differentially reduced EAAT2 levels in the ET cerebellar cortex, which might 
reflect a compensatory mechanism to maintain excitation-inhibition balance in 
cerebellar nuclei.
