Activating mutations in KRAS occur in 32% of lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD). 
Despite leading to aggressive disease and resistance to therapy in preclinical 
studies, the KRAS mutation does not predict patient outcome or response to 
treatment, presumably due to additional events modulating RAS pathways. To 
obtain a broader measure of RAS pathway activation, we developed RAS84, a 
transcriptional signature optimised to capture RAS oncogenic activity in LUAD. 
We report evidence of RAS pathway oncogenic activation in 84% of LUAD, including 
65% KRAS wild-type tumours, falling into four groups characterised by coincident 
alteration of STK11/LKB1, TP53 or CDKN2A, suggesting that the classifications 
developed when considering only KRAS mutant tumours have significance in a 
broader cohort of patients. Critically, high RAS activity patient groups show 
adverse clinical outcome and reduced response to chemotherapy. Patient 
stratification using oncogenic RAS transcriptional activity instead of genetic 
alterations could ultimately assist in clinical decision-making.
