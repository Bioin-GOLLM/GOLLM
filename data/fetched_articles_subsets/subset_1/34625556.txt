OTULIN is a deubiquitinase that specifically cleaves linear ubiquitin chains. 
Here we demonstrate that the ablation of Otulin selectively in keratinocytes 
causes inflammatory skin lesions that develop into verrucous carcinomas. Genetic 
deletion of Tnfr1, knockin expression of kinase-inactive Ripk1 or 
keratinocyte-specific deletion of Fadd and Mlkl completely rescues mice with 
OTULIN deficiency from dermatitis and tumorigenesis, thereby identifying 
keratinocyte cell death as the driving force for inflammation. Single-cell 
RNA-sequencing comparing non-lesional and lesional skin reveals changes in 
epidermal stem cell identity in OTULIN-deficient keratinocytes prior to 
substantial immune cell infiltration. Keratinocytes lacking OTULIN display a 
type-1 interferon and IL-1β response signature, and genetic or pharmacologic 
inhibition of these cytokines partially inhibits skin inflammation. Finally, 
expression of a hypomorphic mutant Otulin allele, previously shown to cause 
OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome in humans, induces a similar 
inflammatory phenotype, thus supporting the importance of OTULIN for restraining 
skin inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis.
