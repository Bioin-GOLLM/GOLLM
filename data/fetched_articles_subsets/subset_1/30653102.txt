Pharmacogenomics offers remarkable potential for the rapid translation of 
discoveries into changes in clinical practice. In the present work, we are 
interested in evaluating the ability of commercially available genome-wide 
association sequencing chips to cover genes that have high pharmacogenomics 
potential.We used a set of 2794 variations within 369 absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and elimination (ADME) genes of interest, as previously defined in 
collaboration with the Pharma ADME consortium. We have compared the Illumina 
TrueSeq and both Agilent SureSelect and HaloPlex sequencing technologies. We 
have developed Python scripts to evaluate the coverage for each of these 
products. In particular, we considered a specific list of 155 allelic variants 
in 34 genes which present high pharmacogenomics potential. Both the theoretical 
and practical coverage was assessed.Given the need to have a good coverage to 
establish confidently the functionality of an enzyme, the observed rates are 
unlikely to provide sufficient evidence for pharmacogenomics studies. We 
assessed the coverage using enrichment technology for exome sequencing using the 
Illumina Trueseq exome, Agilent SureSelectXT1 V4 and V5, and Haloplex exome, 
which offer a coverage of 96.12%, 91.61%, and 88.38%, respectively.Although 
pharmacogenomic advances had been limited in the past due in part to the lack of 
coverage of commercial genotyping chips, it is anticipated that future studies 
that make use of new sequencing technologies should offer a greater potential 
for discovery.
