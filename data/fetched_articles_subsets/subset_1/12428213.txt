Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1A (LGMD1A [MIM 159000]) is an autosomal dominant 
form of muscular dystrophy characterized by adult onset of proximal weakness 
progressing to distal muscle weakness. We have reported elsewhere a mutation in 
the myotilin gene in a large, North American family of German descent. Here, we 
report the mutation screening of an additional 86 families with a variety of 
neuromuscular pathologies. We have identified a new myotilin mutation in an 
Argentinian pedigree with LGMD1 that is predicted to result in the conversion of 
serine 55 to phenylalanine (S55F). This mutation has not been found in 392 
control chromosomes and is located in the unique N-terminal domain of myotilin, 
only two residues from the T57I mutation reported elsewhere. Both T57I and S55F 
are located outside the alpha-actinin and gamma-filamin binding sites within 
myotilin. The identification of two independent pedigrees with the same disease, 
each bearing a different mutation in the same gene, has long been the gold 
standard for establishing a causal relationship between defects in a gene and 
the resultant disease. As a description of the second known pedigree with 
LGMD1A, this finding constitutes that gold standard of proof that mutations in 
the myotilin gene cause LGMD1A.
