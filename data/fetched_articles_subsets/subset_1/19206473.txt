We present an integrated top-down and bottom-up approach that is facilitated by 
concurrent liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis and fraction 
collection for comprehensive high-throughput intact protein profiling. The 
approach employs high-resolution, reversed-phase (RP) LC separations coupled 
on-line with a 12 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass 
spectrometer to profile and tentatively identify modified proteins, using 
detected intact protein masses in conjunction with bare protein identifications 
from the bottom-up analysis of the corresponding LC fractions. Selected 
identifications are incorporated into a target ion list for subsequent off-line 
gas-phase fragmentation that uses an aliquot of the original fraction used for 
bottom-up analysis. In a proof-of-principle demonstration, this comprehensive 
strategy was applied to identify protein isoforms arising from various amino 
acid modifications (e.g., acetylation, phosphorylation) and genetic variants 
(e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs). This strategy overcomes major 
limitations of traditional bottom-up (e.g., inability to characterize multiple 
unexpected protein isoforms and genetic variants) and top-down (e.g., low 
throughput) approaches.
