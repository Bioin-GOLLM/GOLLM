Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) hold promise in treating Parkinson's disease (PD), 
although poor delivery to the brain hinders their therapeutic application. In 
the current study, it is demonstrated that brain-targeted liposomes (BTL) 
enhance the delivery of mAbs across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and into 
neurons, thereby allowing the intracellular and extracellular treatment of the 
PD brain. BTL are decorated with transferrin to improve brain targeting through 
overexpressed transferrin-receptors on the BBB during PD. BTL are loaded with 
SynO4, a mAb that inhibits alpha-synuclein (AS) aggregation, a pathological 
hallmark of PD. It is shown that 100-nm BTL cross human BBB models intact and 
are taken up by primary neurons. Within neurons, SynO4 is released from the 
nanoparticles and bound to its target, thereby reducing AS aggregation, and 
enhancing neuronal viability. In vivo, intravenous BTL administration results in 
a sevenfold increase in mAbs in brain cells, decreasing AS aggregation and 
neuroinflammation. Treatment with BTL also improve behavioral motor function and 
learning ability in mice, with a favorable safety profile. Accordingly, targeted 
nanotechnologies offer a valuable platform for drug delivery to treat brain 
neurodegeneration.
