Spatial resolution of the T cell repertoire is essential for deciphering 
cancer-associated immune dysfunction. Current spatially resolved transcriptomic 
technologies are unable to directly annotate T cell receptors (TCR). We present 
spatially resolved T cell receptor sequencing (SPTCR-seq), which integrates 
optimized target enrichment and long-read sequencing for highly sensitive TCR 
sequencing. The SPTCR computational pipeline achieves yield and coverage per TCR 
comparable to alternative single-cell TCR technologies. Our comparison of 
PCR-based and SPTCR-seq methods underscores SPTCR-seq's superior ability to 
reconstruct the entire TCR architecture, including V, D, J regions and the 
complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3). Employing SPTCR-seq, we assess 
local T cell diversity and clonal expansion across spatially discrete niches. 
Exploration of the reciprocal interaction of the tumor microenvironmental and T 
cells discloses the critical involvement of NK and B cells in T cell exhaustion. 
Integrating spatially resolved omics and TCR sequencing provides as a robust 
tool for exploring T cell dysfunction in cancers and beyond.
