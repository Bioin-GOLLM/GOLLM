The duplication mutation of Quebec platelet disorder dysregulates PLAU, but not 
C10orf55, selectively increasing production of normal PLAU transcripts by 
megakaryocytes but not granulocytes.

Quebec Platelet disorder (QPD) is a unique bleeding disorder that markedly 
increases urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in megakaryocytes and platelets 
but not in plasma or urine. The cause is tandem duplication of a 78 kb region of 
chromosome 10 containing PLAU (the uPA gene) and C10orf55, a gene of unknown 
function. QPD increases uPA in platelets and megakaryocytes >100 fold, far more 
than expected for a gene duplication. To investigate the tissue-specific effect 
that PLAU duplication has on gene expression and transcript structure in QPD, we 
tested if QPD leads to: 1) overexpression of normal or unique PLAU transcripts; 
2) increased uPA in leukocytes; 3) altered levels of C10orf55 mRNA and/or 
protein in megakaryocytes and leukocytes; and 4) global changes in megakaryocyte 
gene expression. Primary cells and cultured megakaryocytes from donors were 
prepared for quantitative reverse polymerase chain reaction analyses, RNA-seq 
and protein expression analyses. Rapidly isolated blood leukocytes from QPD 
subjects showed only a 3.9 fold increase in PLAU transcript levels, in keeping 
with the normal to minimally increased uPA in affinity purified, QPD leukocytes. 
All subjects had more uPA in granulocytes than monocytes and minimal uPA in 
lymphocytes. QPD leukocytes expressed PLAU alleles in proportions consistent 
with an extra copy of PLAU on the disease chromosome, unlike QPD megakaryocytes. 
QPD PLAU transcripts were consistent with reference gene models, with a much 
higher proportion of reads originating from the disease chromosome in 
megakaryocytes than granulocytes. QPD and control megakaryocytes contained 
minimal reads for C10orf55, and C10orf55 protein was not increased in QPD 
megakaryocytes or platelets. Finally, our QPD megakaryocyte transcriptome 
analysis revealed a global down regulation of the interferon type 1 pathway. We 
suggest that the low endogenous levels of uPA in blood are actively regulated, 
and that the regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in QPD in a 
megakaryocyte-specific manner.
