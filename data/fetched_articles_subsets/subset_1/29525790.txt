BACKGROUND: Dietary acid load (DAL) contributes to the risk of CKD and CKD 
progression. We sought to determine the relation of DAL to racial/ethnic 
differences in the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among persons with 
CKD.
METHODS: Among 1,123 non-Hispanic black (NHB) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III participants with estimated 
glomerular filtration rate 15-59 mL/min/1.73 m2, DAL was estimated using the 
Remer and Manz net acid excretion (NAEes) formula and 24-h dietary recall. ESRD 
events were ascertained via linkage with Medicare. A competing risk model 
(accounting for death) was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for treated 
ESRD, comparing NHBs with NHWs, adjusting for demographic, clinical and 
nutritional factors (body surface area, total caloric intake, serum bicarbonate, 
protein intake), and NAEes. Additionally, whether the relation of NAEes with 
ESRD risk varied by race/ethnicity was tested.
RESULTS: At baseline, NHBs had greater NAEes (50.9 vs. 44.2 mEq/day) than NHWs. 
It was found that 22% developed ESRD over a median of 7.5 years. The unadjusted 
HR comparing NHBs to NHWs was 3.35 (95% CI 2.51-4.48) and adjusted HR (for 
factors above) was 1.68 (95% CI 1.18-2.38). A stronger association of NAE with 
risk of ESRD was observed among NHBs (adjusted HR per mEq/day increase in NAE 
1.21, 95% CI 1.12-1.31) than that among NHWs (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96-1.20), p 
interaction for race/ethnicity × NAEes = 0.004.
CONCLUSIONS: Among US adults with CKD, the association of DAL with progression 
to ESRD is stronger among NHBs than NHWs. DAL is worthy of further investigation 
for its contribution to kidney outcomes across race/ethnic groups.
