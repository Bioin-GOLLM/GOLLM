OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of ICAM-1 469K/E gene polymorphisms on 
the risk of atrophic gastritis and dysplasia.
METHODS: The ICAM-1 469K/E gene polymorphisms in a total of 372 subjects were 
detected by polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing. All of the subjects 
were from Linqu County, a high risk area of gastric cancer in Shandong Province 
of northern China. All cases were initially diagnosed as normal or superficial 
gastritis at the beginning of this study. After a 5-year follow-up, the cases 
were subdivided into no progression group (no histological progression, n=137), 
progression group I (progressed to severe chronic atrophic gastritis, n=194) and 
progression group II (progressed to low-grade dysplasia, n=41).
RESULTS: In all 372 subjects, the frequencies of KK, KE or EE genotype of ICAM-1 
K469E were 50.5%, 39.2% and 10.2%, respectively. No significant differences were 
observed in the ICAM-1 469K/E genotype frequencies between the progression group 
I and no progression group (P>0.05). The frequencies of KK genotype (68.3%) were 
significantly higher in the progression group II than in the no progression 
group (49.6%, P=0.035), and also than in the progression group I (47.4%, 
P=0.015). An increased risk of the progressing to dysplasia from normal or 
superficial gastritis was found in the individuals with ICAM-1 469KK genotype 
[odds ratio (OR)=2.21, 95%CI, 1.10-4.42].
CONCLUSION: ICAM-1 469K/E gene polymorphisms are significantly associated with 
the risk of gastric low-grade dysplasia, but not related with severe chronic 
atrophic gastritis in a population with high risk of gastric cancer in Linqu 
County, Shandong Province, China.
