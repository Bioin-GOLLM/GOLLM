Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders 
characterized by hyperextensible skin, joint hypermobility and soft tissue 
fragility. For molecular diagnosis, targeted exome sequencing was performed on a 
9-year-old male patient who was clinically suspected to have EDS. The patient 
presented with progressive kyphoscoliosis, joint hypermobility and 
hyperextensible skin without scars. Ultimately, classical EDS was diagnosed by 
identifying a novel, mono-allelic mutation in COL5A2 
[NM_000393.3(COL5A2_v001):c.682G>A, p.Gly228Arg].
