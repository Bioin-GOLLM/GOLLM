We have previously described the first homozygous cases of Hb Knossos in an 
Algerian family. The Hb A2 was completely absent, ascertaining the presence of a 
delta zero-thalassemia determinant in cis of the beta Knossos S gene. Here, we 
investigate the affected delta-globin gene. The complete DNA sequence of the 
gene and its 5' and 3' flanking regions was determined. Only two nucleotide 
changes were recorded: a C----T substitution at -199 and an AT insertion at -448 
upstream from the cap site. To examine the involvement of these changes in gene 
function, the delta-gene was subcloned in an expression vector and introduced 
into COS cells. Analysis of RNA derived from these cells, using an S1 protection 
assay and dot-blot hybridization, revealed qualitatively and quantitatively 
normal transcription. The loss of delta-globin gene activity in vivo may be due 
to the alteration of a tissue-specific control.
