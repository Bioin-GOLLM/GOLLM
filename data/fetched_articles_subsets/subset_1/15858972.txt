N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency is a rare urea cycle disorder. Most 
of the patients present in the early neonatal period with severe hyperammonaemia 
and marked neurological impairment. We report on a Turkish family with an index 
patient, who died due to hyperammonemia, and another three siblings, who 
received a prophylactic treatment consisting of arginine hydrochloride, sodium 
benzoate and phenylbutyrate directly after birth. Enzyme measurement in a liver 
biopsy suggested a diagnosis of partial NAGS deficiency in all three siblings. 
Thereafter, N-carbamylglutamate was added to the treatment. None of the patients 
developed hyperammonaemia. After the human NAGS gene was identified, mutation 
analysis revealed that the consanguineous parents and two siblings were 
heterozygous for a private mutation (W484R), whereas the wild-type gene was 
found in the eldest sibling. Therapy was stopped without any deterioration of 
urea cycle function.
CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of partial NAGS deficiency based on enzyme measurement may 
be misleading and should be completed by mutation analysis.
