OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to analyze the association between the growth 
hormone-insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH-IGF-1) axis gene polymorphisms and 
short stature in Chinese children.
METHODS: 181 growth hormone deficiency (GHD) patients and 206 normal stature 
controls were enrolled to attend this study. Five single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms in the GH receptor (GHR) and 5 SNPs within the GH-signaling 
pathway were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of 
flight mass spectrometry. We conducted an association study between these SNPs 
and the risk of developing short stature. Linkage disequilibrium analysis was 
performed using Haploview software and the associations of the SNPs frequencies 
with short stature were analyzed using X2 tests.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found in gender, weight, height, and BMI 
between the GHD and control groups, except that the age of GHD group was older 
than the control one. Allele and genotype frequencies were consistent with those 
expected from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Compared with the controls, 
heterozygous genotype frequencies (CT) of rs12515480 and rs6873545 of GHR gene 
were significantly lower. Genotype frequencies of the other 8 SNPs did not show 
significant difference between these two groups. Considering a dominant model, 
an OR < 1 was observed for genotypes rs12515480 (OR = 0.532, P = 0.019) and 
rs6873545 (OR = 0.587, P = 0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: The heterozygous genotypes of rs12515480 and rs6873545 of GHR gene 
were associated with decreased risk of GHD in Chinese children.
