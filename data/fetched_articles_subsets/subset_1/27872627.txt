Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a rare population that gives rise to almost 
all cells of the hematopoietic system, including immune cells. Until recently, 
it was thought that immune cells sense inflammatory signaling and HSCs respond 
only secondarily to these signals. However, it was later shown that adult HSCs 
could directly sense and respond to inflammatory signals, resulting in a higher 
output of immune cells. Recent studies demonstrated that inflammatory signaling 
is also vital for HSC ontogeny. These signals are thought to arise in the 
absence of pathogens, are active during development, and indispensable for HSC 
formation. In contrast, during times of stress and disease, inflammatory 
responses can be activated and can have devastating effects on HSCs. In this 
review, we summarize the current knowledge about inflammatory signaling in HSC 
development and maintenance, as well as the endogenous molecular cues that can 
trigger inflammatory pathway activation. Finally, we comment of the role of 
inflammatory signaling in hematopoietic diseases.
