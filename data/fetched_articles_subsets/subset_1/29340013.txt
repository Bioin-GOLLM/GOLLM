Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the deadliest brain tumor. State-of-art GBM 
therapy often fails to ensure control of a disease characterized by high 
frequency of recurrences and progression. In search for novel therapeutic 
approaches, we assayed the effect of compounds from a cancer drug library on the 
ADF GBM cell line, establishing their elevated sensitivity to mitotic spindle 
poisons. Our previous work showed that the effectiveness of the spindle poison 
paclitaxel in inhibiting cancer cell growth was dependent on the expression of 
RANBP1, a regulatory target of the serine/threonine kinase SGK1. Recently, we 
developed the small molecule SI113 to inhibit SGK1 activity. Therefore, we 
explored the outcome of the association between SI113 and selected spindle 
poisons, finding that these drugs generated a synergistic cytotoxic effect in 
GBM cells, drastically reducing their viability and clonogenic capabilities in 
vitro, as well as inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. We also defined the molecular 
bases of such a synergistic effect. Because SI113 displays low systemic 
toxicity, yet strong activity in potentiating the effect of radiotherapy in GBM 
cells, we believe that this drug could be a strong candidate for clinical 
trials, with the aim to add it to the current GBM therapeutic approaches.
