Wnt signalling regulates multiple processes including angiogenesis, 
inflammation, and tumorigenesis. Norrin (Norrie Disease Protein) is a 
cystine-knot like growth factor. Although unrelated to Wnt, Norrin activates the 
Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. Signal complex formation involves Frizzled4 (Fz4), 
low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 5/6 (Lrp5/6), Tetraspanin-12 
and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Here, we report crystallographic and small-angle 
X-ray scattering analyses of Norrin in complex with Fz4 cysteine-rich domain 
(Fz4CRD), of this complex bound with GAG analogues, and of unliganded Norrin and 
Fz4CRD. Our structural, biophysical and cellular data, map Fz4 and putative 
Lrp5/6 binding sites to distinct patches on Norrin, and reveal a GAG binding 
site spanning Norrin and Fz4CRD. These results explain numerous 
disease-associated mutations. Comparison with the Xenopus Wnt8-mouse Fz8CRD 
complex reveals Norrin mimics Wnt for Frizzled recognition. The production and 
characterization of wild-type and mutant Norrins reported here open new avenues 
for the development of therapeutics to combat abnormal Norrin/Wnt signalling.
