MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding, regulatory RNA molecules and 
constitute a newly recognized, important layer of gene-expression regulation at 
post-transcriptional levels. miRNAs quantitatively fine tune the expression of 
their downstream genes in a cell type- and developmental stage-specific fashion. 
miRNAs have been proven to play important roles in the normal development and 
function as well as in the pathogenesis of diseases in all tissues and organ 
systems. miRNAs have emerged as new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for 
treatment and diagnosis of various diseases. Although miRNA research in ocular 
infection remains in its early stages, a handful of pioneering studies have 
provided insight into the roles of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of parasitic, 
fungal, bacterial, and viral ocular infections. Here, we review the current 
status of research in miRNAs in several major ocular infectious diseases. We 
predict that the field of miRNAs in ocular infection will greatly expand with 
the discovery of novel miRNA-involved molecular mechanisms that will inform 
development of new therapies and identify novel diagnostic biomarkers.
