BACKGROUND: Triplex vaccine was developed to enhance cytomegalovirus 
(CMV)-specific T cells and prevent CMV reactivation early after hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant (HCT).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of Triplex.
DESIGN: First-in-patient, phase 2 trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02506933).
SETTING: 3 U.S. HCT centers.
PARTICIPANTS: 102 CMV-seropositive HCT recipients at high risk for CMV 
reactivation.
INTERVENTION: Intramuscular injections of Triplex or placebo were given on days 
28 and 56 after HCT. Triplex is a recombinant attenuated poxvirus (modified 
vaccinia Ankara) expressing immunodominant CMV antigens.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes were CMV events (CMV DNA level ≥1250 IU/mL, 
CMV viremia requiring antiviral treatment, or end-organ disease), nonrelapse 
mortality, and severe (grade 3 or 4) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), all 
evaluated through 100 days after HCT, and grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) 
within 2 weeks after vaccination that were probably or definitely attributable 
to injection.
RESULTS: A total of 102 patients (51 per group) received the first vaccination, 
and 91 (89.2%) received both vaccinations (46 Triplex and 45 placebo). 
Reactivation of CMV occurred in 5 Triplex (9.8%) and 10 placebo (19.6%) 
recipients (hazard ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.16 to 1.4]; P = 0.075). No Triplex 
recipient died of nonrelapse causes during the first 100 days or had serious 
AEs, and no grade 3 or 4 AEs related to vaccination were observed within 2 weeks 
after vaccination. Incidence of severe acute GVHD after injection was similar 
between groups (hazard ratio, 1.1 [CI, 0.53 to 2.4]; P = 0.23). Levels of 
long-lasting, pp65-specific T cells with effector memory phenotype were 
significantly higher in Triplex than placebo recipients.
LIMITATION: The lower-than-expected incidence of CMV events in the placebo group 
reduced the power of the trial.
CONCLUSION: No vaccine-associated safety concerns were identified. Triplex 
elicited and amplified CMV-specific immune responses, and fewer 
Triplex-vaccinated patients had CMV viremia.
