INTRODUCTION: Patient experience of nursing care is correlated with safety, 
clinical effectiveness, care quality, treatment outcomes and service use. 
Effective nursing care includes actions to develop nurse-patient relationships 
and deliver physical and psychosocial care to patients. The high risk of 
transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus compromises nursing care. No evidence-based 
nursing guidelines exist for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, leading to 
potential variations in patient experience, outcomes, quality and costs. METHODS 
AND ANALYSIS: we aim to recruit 840 in-patient participants treated for 
infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus from 14 UK hospitals, to a cluster 
randomised controlled trial, with embedded process and economic evaluations, of 
care as usual and a fundamental nursing care protocol addressing specific areas 
of physical, relational and psychosocial nursing care where potential variation 
may occur, compared with care as usual. Our coprimary outcomes are 
patient-reported experience (Quality from the Patients' Perspective; Relational 
Aspects of Care Questionnaire); secondary outcomes include care quality 
(pressure injuries, falls, medication errors); functional ability (Barthell 
Index); treatment outcomes (WHO Clinical Progression Scale); depression Patient 
Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), anxiety General Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2), 
health utility (EQ5D) and nurse-reported outcomes (Measure of Moral Distress for 
Health Care Professionals). For our primary analysis, we will use a standard 
generalised linear mixed-effect model adjusting for ethnicity of the patient 
sample and research intensity at cluster level. We will also undertake a planned 
subgroup analysis to compare the impact of patient-level ethnicity on our 
primary and secondary outcomes and will undertake process and economic 
evaluations.
