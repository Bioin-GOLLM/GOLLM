Protein-folding occurs in several intracellular locations including the 
endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. In normal conditions there is a balance 
between the levels of unfolded proteins and protein folding machinery. 
Disruption of homeostasis and an accumulation of unfolded proteins trigger 
stress responses, or unfolded protein responses (UPR), in these organelles. 
These pathways signal to increase the folding capacity, inhibit protein import 
or expression, increase protein degradation, and potentially trigger cell death. 
Many aging-related neurodegenerative diseases involve the accumulation of 
misfolded proteins in both the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. The exact 
participation of the UPRs in the onset of neurodegeneration is unclear, but 
there is significant evidence for the alteration of these pathways in the 
endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Here we will discuss the involvement of 
endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress and the possible contributions of 
the UPR in these organelles to the development of two neurodegenerative 
diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
