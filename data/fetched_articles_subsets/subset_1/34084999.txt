BACKGROUND: Expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells 
with or without immune cells is widely reported in clinical trials of programmed 
cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) blockade in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. 
Various cutpoints have been studied.
METHODS: We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and conference 
proceedings up to December 2019 for randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials 
of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. 
We retrieved data on objective response rate (ORR), 1-year and 2-year 
progression-free survival (PFS), and 2-year and 3-year overall survival (OS) in 
various PD-L1 subgroups. Results were pooled and analyzed based on different 
cutpoints, with nonrandomized comparisons made with pooled chemotherapy 
outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 9810 patients in 27 studies were included. In 
treatment-naïve patients, benefits with PD-1 blockade over chemotherapy were 
seen in ORR in patients having PD-L1 50% or greater, in 2-year OS for PD-L1 1% 
or greater, and in 1-year PFS, 2-year PFS, and 3-year OS for unselected 
patients. First-line PD-1 blockade compared with chemotherapy demonstrated 
higher ORR, 2-year PFS, and 3-year OS if PD-L1 was 50% or greater; lower ORR, 
higher 2-year PFS, and similar 3-year OS if PD-L1 was 1%-49%; and lower ORR, 
similar 1-year PFS, and lower 2-year OS if PD-L1 was less than 1%. In previously 
treated patients, PD-1 blockade demonstrated similar or superior outcomes to 
chemotherapy in all PD-L1 subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 should guide the choice of PD-1 blockade vs chemotherapy in 
treatment-naïve patients. In previously treated patients, PD-1 blockade provides 
a favorable outcome profile to chemotherapy in all PD-L1 subgroups.
