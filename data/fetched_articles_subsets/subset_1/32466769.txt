BACKGROUND: Bartholin gland carcinomas (BGCs) are rare tumor types, for which no 
molecular analyses including genomic sequencing have been reported to date. 
Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) of the Bartholin's glands are an atypical 
histological type of BGC, and currently nothing is known regarding their genetic 
profiles or similarity to ACC carcinogenesis in other organs including the 
salivary glands, thereby limiting possible therapeutic options using precision 
medicine.
CASE PRESENTATION: We used targeted gene sequencing to analyze the occurrence of 
160 cancer-related genes in two patients with BG-ACC. KRAS and KDM6A mutations 
were detected in tumor samples collected from each patient. No KRAS mutations 
have been previously reported in salivary gland ACCs, indicating that the 
carcinogenesis of BG-ACC differs from that of the salivary gland ACCs. KDM6A 
mutations are often reported in salivary gland ACCs and facilitate novel 
gene-targeted therapy, including the use of BET and HDAC inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms will 
help to clarify the carcinogenesis of BG-ACC. In turn, this will enable 
treatment with novel targeting agents, as well as the initial exploration of 
gene-based precision oncological therapies, which aim to improve treatment 
outcomes for patients with this disease.
