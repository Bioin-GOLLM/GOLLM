BACKGROUND: Transmission within families and multiple spike protein mutations 
have been associated with the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to: (1) 
describe full genome characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and correlate the sequences 
with epidemiological data within family clusters, and (2) conduct phylogenetic 
analysis of all samples from Yogyakarta and Central Java, Indonesia and other 
countries.
METHODS: The study involved 17 patients with COVID-19, including two family 
clusters. We determined the full-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using the 
Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer. Phylogenetic analysis was performed 
using a dataset of 142 full-genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from different regions.
RESULTS: Ninety-four SNPs were detected throughout the open reading frame (ORF) 
of SARS-CoV-2 samples with 58% (54/94) of the nucleic acid changes resulting in 
amino acid mutations. About 94% (16/17) of the virus samples showed D614G on 
spike protein and 56% of these (9/16) showed other various amino acid mutations 
on this protein, including L5F, V83L, V213A, W258R, Q677H, and N811I. The virus 
samples from family cluster-1 (n = 3) belong to the same clade GH, in which two 
were collected from deceased patients, and the other from the survived patient. 
All samples from this family cluster revealed a combination of spike protein 
mutations of D614G and V213A. Virus samples from family cluster-2 (n = 3) also 
belonged to the clade GH and showed other spike protein mutations of L5F 
alongside the D614G mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first comprehensive report associating the 
full-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with the epidemiological data within family 
clusters. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three viruses from family 
cluster-1 formed a monophyletic group, whereas viruses from family cluster-2 
formed a polyphyletic group indicating there is the possibility of different 
sources of infection. This study highlights how the same spike protein mutations 
among members of the same family might show different disease outcomes.
