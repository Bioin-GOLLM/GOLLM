Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks in Central and South America caused severe public 
health problems in 2015 and 2016. These outbreaks were finally contained through 
several methods, including mosquito control using insecticides and repellents. 
Additionally, the development of herd immunity in these countries might have 
contributed to containing the epidemic. While ZIKV is mainly transmitted by 
mosquito bites and mucosal transmission via bodily fluids, including the semen 
of infected individuals, has also been reported. We evaluated the effect of 
mucosal ZIKV infection on continuous subcutaneous challenges in a cynomolgus 
monkey model. Repeated intravaginal inoculations of ZIKV did not induce 
detectable viremia or clinical symptoms, and all animals developed a potent 
neutralizing antibody, protecting animals from the subsequent subcutaneous 
superchallenge. These results suggest that viral replication at mucosal sites 
can induce protective immunity without causing systemic viremia or symptoms.
