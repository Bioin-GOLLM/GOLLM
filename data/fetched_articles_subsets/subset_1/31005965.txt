BACKGROUND: The relation between taste perception, diet, and adiposity remains 
controversial. Additionally, there is a lack of knowledge on the polymorphisms 
influencing taste given the scarcity of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
published.
OBJECTIVES: We studied the relation between perception of the basic tastes, 
i.e., sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and umami (separately and jointly in a "taste 
score"), and anthropometric measurements in older subjects with metabolic 
syndrome (MetS). GWASs were undertaken to identify genes associated with basic 
tastes and their score.
METHODS: Taste perception was cross-sectionally determined by challenging 
subjects (381 older individuals with MetS) with solutions (5 concentrations) of 
the basic tastes with the use of standard prototypical tastants 
(phenylthiocarbamide and 6-n-propylthiouracil, NaCl, sucrose, monopotassium 
glutamate, and citric acid, for bitter, salt, sweet, umami, and sour, 
respectively). Taste perception intensities were expressed on a scale. A total 
taste score was derived.
RESULTS: The total taste score was inversely associated with body weight, body 
mass index, and waist circumference (P < 0.05). Subjects having a total taste 
score higher than or equal to the median (11 points for concentration V) were 
less likely to be classified as obese than subjects below the median (OR: 0.36; 
95% CI: 0.22, 0.59; P < 0.001). Associations were similar, albeit less strong, 
for some taste qualities. In the GWASs, the highest associations were for bitter 
taste (rs1726866-TAS2R38, with P = 7.74 × 10-18 for phenylthiocarbamide and 
P = 3.96 × 10-19 for 6-n-propylthiouracil). For other tastes, several 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exceeded the P threshold of 1 × 10-5. 
However, the top-ranked SNPs independently explained a low percentage of taste 
variability, hence their use as single proxies for the association between taste 
perception and adiposity is limited.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong inverse association between greater taste 
perception and body weight, body mass index, and waist circumference in older 
subjects with MetS and identified some taste-related SNPs. It would be 
advantageous to identify additional genetic proxies for taste and to develop 
polygenic scores. Data used in this study were derived from the clinical trial 
PREDIMED PLUS at baseline, registered at http://www.isrctn.com as
