Hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) type I and II 
is a rare and life-threatening disease caused by SERPING1 gene mutations. 
Previous genetic studies indicated a wide spectrum of disease-associated 
variants in the SERPING1 gene and often lack of correlation with patient's 
phenotypes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence, type, and 
localization of mutations in the SERPING1 gene in 41 Polish patients with 
C1-INH-HAE and their relation with case/family history, type of C1-INH-HAE, 
fC1-INH, age of onset, and disease severity. Sanger sequencing and MLPA method 
were used for detection of disease-associated variants. In 34 (82.9%) patients, 
mutations located in various regions of SERPING1 gene were revealed. The 
detected alterations in patients with C1-INH-HAE type I differed and were 
positioned in various exons/introns of the SERPING1 gene. The most frequent 
disease-associated variants appeared in exon 3 (especially in type I) and in 
exon 8 (type I and II). Out of 20 different disease-causing variants, 9 were not 
previously described. We did not find any relation between the type and location 
of the mutations and no type of features included in phenotype evaluation of the 
patients, such as case and family history, type of C1-INH-HAE, age of onset, 
biochemical parameters, or severity of disease.
