We have used isoform-specific RNA interference knockdowns to investigate the 
roles of myosin IIA (MIIA) and MIIB in the component processes that drive cell 
migration. Both isoforms reside outside of protrusions and act at a distance to 
regulate cell protrusion, signaling, and maturation of nascent adhesions. MIIA 
also controls the dynamics and size of adhesions in central regions of the cell 
and contributes to retraction and adhesion disassembly at the rear. In contrast, 
MIIB establishes front-back polarity and centrosome, Golgi, and nuclear 
orientation. Using ATPase- and contraction-deficient mutants of both MIIA and 
MIIB, we show a role for MIIB-dependent actin cross-linking in establishing 
front-back polarity. From these studies, MII emerges as a master regulator and 
integrator of cell migration. It mediates each of the major component processes 
that drive migration, e.g., polarization, protrusion, adhesion assembly and 
turnover, polarity, signaling, and tail retraction, and it integrates spatially 
separated processes.
