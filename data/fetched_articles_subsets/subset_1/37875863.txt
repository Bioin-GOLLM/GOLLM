OBJECTIVE: Sakura extract is a natural flavonoid compound that may have 
potential anti-tumor effects. The paper focuses on investigating Sakuranin 
mechanism on bladder cancer (BC) cells.
METHODS: BC cells (T24) were treated with different concentrations of Sakuranin, 
with 48-h IC50 determined. T24 cells were treated with Sakuranin at IC50, 
followed by assessment of cell proliferative/apoptotic/migrative/invasive 
activities by CCK-8, EdU and plate clone formation assays/flow 
cytometry/Transwell/scratch test. MMP-2 (migration and invasion-related protein) 
protein level was assessed by Western blot. Cell autophagy was evaluated by 
measuring the protein levels of autophagy markers (LC3-I/LC3-II/p62) through 
Western blot. The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA was used to validate the role of 
autophagy in the regulatory mechanism of Sakuranin in T24 cell behaviors. 
Furthermore, the activation of the p53/mTOR pathway in cells was detected and a 
combination of Sakuranin and p53 inhibitor Pifithrin-µ was adopted to explore 
the involvement of this pathway.
RESULTS: Sakuranin decreased T24 cell proliferation/EdU positive cell 
percentage/colony formation number and area/migration/invasion/scratch 
healing/MMP-2 protein level, and accelerated apoptosis. Sakuranin elevated the 
LC3-II/I ratio and lowered p62 level in T24 cells. 3-MA partially averted 
Sakuranin-mediated repression on cell malignant behaviors. Sakuranin upregulated 
p-p53 and p53 levels, and decreased the p-mTOR/mTOR ratio in T24 cells. The 
effects of Sakuranin on cell biological behaviors were partly annulled by 
Pifithrin-µ treatment.
CONCLUSION: Sakuranin suppressed T24 cell proliferation/migration/invasion, and 
enhanced apoptosis by potentiating autophagy through activating the p53/mTOR 
pathway. This study provided a theoretical basis for Sakuranin as a potential 
drug for clinical treatment of BC.
