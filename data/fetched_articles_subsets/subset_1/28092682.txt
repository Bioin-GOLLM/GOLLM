The extent of heterogeneity among driver gene mutations present in naturally 
occurring metastases-that is, treatment-naive metastatic disease-is largely 
unknown. To address this issue, we carried out 60Ã— whole-genome sequencing of 26 
metastases from four patients with pancreatic cancer. We found that identical 
mutations in known driver genes were present in every metastatic lesion for each 
patient studied. Passenger gene mutations, which do not have known or predicted 
functional consequences, accounted for all intratumoral heterogeneity. Even with 
respect to these passenger mutations, our analysis suggests that the genetic 
similarity among the founding cells of metastases was higher than that expected 
for any two cells randomly taken from a normal tissue. The uniformity of known 
driver gene mutations among metastases in the same patient has critical and 
encouraging implications for the success of future targeted therapies in 
advanced-stage disease.
