PURPOSE: Familial adenomatous polyposis is an autosomal dominant disease 
characterized by the presence of 100 or more colorectal adenomatous polyps. 
Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene are primarily responsible for 
the development of this disease. This study was designed to investigation of 
adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations in members of familial 
adenomatous polyposis family to identify individuals at risk of the disease.
METHODS: We examined one patient with familial adenomatous polyposis and 21 
family members including one affected person from familial adenomatous polyposis 
and 20 nonsymptomatic persons. We studied E, D, F, and G segments of exon 15 of 
the adenomatous polyposis coli gene by heteroduplex analysis.
RESULTS: We used silver staining method for staining. We found a mutation for 
five persons at segment F of exon 15 of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. Two 
of them were affected by colorectal cancer, one of whom was the proband, and the 
other three were nonsymptomatic family members. The pathogenetic mutation was a 
T deletion at codon 1172, causing a frameshift in the adenomatous polyposis coli 
gene, as a result of the sequencing analysis of these cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutations is very 
important for the identification of genetic susceptibility to colorectal cancer 
and for the definition of tumor developing at an early stage. Furthermore, the 
identification of this mutation for the first time in a Turkish family will be 
useful to foster further studies on familial adenomatous polyposis in Turkey.
