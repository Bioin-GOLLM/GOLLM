We studied the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan, 
using the daily case-reporting data from May 5 to June 4 to learn how it had 
spread so rapidly. Our results indicate that most SARS-infected persons had 
symptoms and were admitted before their infections were reclassified as probable 
cases. This finding could indicate efficient admission, slow reclassification 
process, or both. The high percentage of nosocomial infections in Taiwan 
suggests that infection from hospitalized patients with suspected, but not yet 
classified, cases is a major factor in the spread of disease. Delays in 
reclassification also contributed to the problem. Because accurate diagnostic 
testing for SARS is currently lacking, intervention measures aimed at more 
efficient diagnosis, isolation of suspected SARS patients, and reclassification 
procedures could greatly reduce the number of infections in future outbreaks.
