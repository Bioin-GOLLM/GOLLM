fmtA encodes a low-affinity penicillin binding protein in Staphylococcus aureus. 
It is part of the core cell wall stimulon and is involved in methicillin 
resistance in S. aureus. Here, we report that the transcription factor, SarA, a 
pleiotropic regulator of virulence genes in S. aureus, regulates the expression 
of fmtA. In vitro binding studies with purified SarA revealed that it binds to 
specific sites within the 541-bp promoter region of fmtA. Mutation of a key 
residue of the regulatory activity of SarA (Arg90) abolished binding of SarA to 
the fmtA promoter, suggesting that SarA binds specifically to the fmtA promoter 
region. In vivo analysis of the fmtA promoter using a lux operon reporter fusion 
show high level expression following oxacillin induction, which was abrogated in 
a sarA mutant strain. These data suggest that SarA is essential for the 
induction of fmtA expression by cell wall-specific antibiotics. Further, in 
vitro transcription studies show that SarA enhances fmtA transcription and 
suggest that regulation of fmtA could be via a SigA-dependent mechanism. 
Overall, our results show that SarA plays a direct role in the regulation of 
fmtA expression via binding to the fmtA promoter.
