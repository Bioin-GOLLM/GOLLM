methanol monosolvate.

The title mefloquine derivative has been crystallized as its 1:1 methanol 
solvate, C(19)H(18)F(6)N(2)O(2)·CH(3)OH. Each of the meth-ine-hydroxyl residue 
[the C-C-C-O torsion angle is -16.35 (17) °] and the piperidinyl group 
[distorted chair conformation] lies to one side of the quinolinyl ring system. 
The hydroxyl and carbonyl groups lie to either side of the mol-ecule, enabling 
their participation in inter-molecular inter-actions. Thus, the hydroxyl and 
carbonyl groups of two centrosymmetrically related mol-ecules are bridged by two 
methanol mol-ecules via O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, leading to a four-mol-ecule 
aggregate. These are linked into a supra-molecular chain along the a axis via 
C-H⋯O inter-actions involving the hydroxyl-O atom. The chains assemble into 
layers that inter-digitate along the c axis being connected by C-H⋯F 
inter-actions.
