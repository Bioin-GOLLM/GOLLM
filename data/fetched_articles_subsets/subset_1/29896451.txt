Hypoxia is a common feature in solid tumors and is associated with cancer 
progression. The main regulators of the hypoxic response are hypoxia-inducible 
transcription factors (HIFs) that guide the cellular adaptation to hypoxia by 
gene activation. The actual oxygen sensing is performed by HIF prolyl 
hydroxylases (PHDs) that under normoxic conditions mark the HIF-Î± subunit for 
degradation. Cancer progression is not regulated only by the cancer cells 
themselves but also by the whole tumor microenvironment, which consists of 
cellular and extracellular components. Hypoxic conditions also affect the 
stromal compartment, where stromal cells are in close contact with the cancer 
cells. The important function of HIF in cancer cells has been shown by many 
animal models and described in hundreds of reviews, but less in known about PHDs 
and even less PHDs in stromal cells. Here, we review hypoxic signaling in 
tumors, mainly in the tumor stroma, with a focus on HIFs and PHDs.
