The advent of immunotherapy, especially checkpoint inhibitor-based 
immunotherapy, has provided novel and powerful weapons against cancer. Because 
only a subset of cancer patients exhibit durable responses, further exploration 
of the mechanisms underlying the resistance to immunotherapy in the bulk of 
cancer patients is merited. Such efforts may help to identify which patients 
could benefit from immune checkpoint blockade. Given the existence of a great 
number of pathways by which cancer can escape immune surveillance, and the 
complexity of tumor-immune system interaction, development of various 
combination therapies, including those that combine with conventional therapies, 
would be necessary. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of 
the mechanisms by which resistance to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy occurs, 
and outline how actionable combination strategies may be derived to improve 
clinical outcomes for patients.
