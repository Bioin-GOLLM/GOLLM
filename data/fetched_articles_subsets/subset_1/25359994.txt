Germline loss-of-function mutations in the transcription factor signal 
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) cause immunodeficiency, 
whereas somatic gain-of-function mutations in STAT3 are associated with large 
granular lymphocytic leukemic, myelodysplastic syndrome, and aplastic anemia. 
Recently, germline mutations in STAT3 have also been associated with autoimmune 
disease. Here, we report on 13 individuals from 10 families with 
lymphoproliferation and early-onset solid-organ autoimmunity associated with 9 
different germline heterozygous mutations in STAT3. Patients exhibited a variety 
of clinical features, with most having lymphadenopathy, autoimmune cytopenias, 
multiorgan autoimmunity (lung, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and/or endocrine 
dysfunction), infections, and short stature. Functional analyses demonstrate 
that these mutations confer a gain-of-function in STAT3 leading to secondary 
defects in STAT5 and STAT1 phosphorylation and the regulatory T-cell 
compartment. Treatment targeting a cytokine pathway that signals through STAT3 
led to clinical improvement in 1 patient, suggesting a potential therapeutic 
option for such patients. These results suggest that there is a broad range of 
autoimmunity caused by germline STAT3 gain-of-function mutations, and that 
hematologic autoimmunity is a major component of this newly described disorder. 
Some patients for this study were enrolled in a trial registered at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00001350.
