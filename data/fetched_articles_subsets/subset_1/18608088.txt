The authors present a 50-year-old patient with adult-onset amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) that was rapidly progressing. Screening of the spastin gene 
revealed a heterozygous missense change S44L. We excluded the involvement of the 
ALS-linked gene for copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). This unusual 
phenotype shows that allelic variants of spastin may predispose bearers to a 
greater spectrum of motor neuron disorders including ALS.
