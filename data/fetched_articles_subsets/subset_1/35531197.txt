BACKGROUND: The human transcriptome across a variety of cell types and tissues 
are affected by stress and other psychological factors. Preksha Dhyana 
meditation (PM) is effective at improving cognitive skills in novice healthy 
college student meditators after 8 weeks of intervention, but the molecular and 
cellular mechanisms involved in these improvements are still largely unknown.
METHODS: In order to decipher potential mechanisms at the cellular level, 
transcriptomic profiling analyses, from peripheral blood, were performed at 
baseline and 8 weeks post-intervention in 18-paired participants (RNASeq).
RESULTS: At the transcriptomic level, 494 genes were nominally differentially 
expressed (p-value ≤ 0.05) between baseline and 8 weeks post-intervention. Our 
data showed that 136 genes were upregulated, while 358 genes were downregulated. 
These genes were enriched in several cellular pathways including innate and 
adaptive immunity, cell signaling, and other metabolic processes.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings indicate that PM meditation affects gene 
expression patterns from whole blood in novice healthy college students. 
Improvements at the cognitive skills were also mirrored with changes at RNA 
expression profiling.
