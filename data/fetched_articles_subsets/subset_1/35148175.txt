Hair cell (HC) loss within the inner ear cochlea is a leading cause for deafness 
in humans. Before the onset of hearing, immature supporting cells (SCs) in 
neonatal mice have some limited capacity for HC regeneration. Here, we show that 
in organoid culture, transient activation of the progenitor-specific RNA binding 
protein LIN28B and Activin antagonist follistatin (FST) enhances regenerative 
competence of maturing/mature cochlear SCs by reprogramming them into 
progenitor-like cells. Transcriptome profiling and mechanistic studies reveal 
that LIN28B drives SC reprogramming, while FST is required to counterbalance 
hyperactivation of transforming growth factor-Î²-type signaling by LIN28B. Last, 
we show that LIN28B and FST coactivation enhances spontaneous cochlear HC 
regeneration in neonatal mice and that LIN28B may be part of an endogenous 
repair mechanism that primes SCs for HC regeneration. These findings indicate 
that SC dedifferentiation is critical for HC regeneration and identify LIN28B 
and FST as main regulators.
