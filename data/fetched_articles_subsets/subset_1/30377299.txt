Sleep and wakefulness control in the mammalian brain requires the coordination 
of various discrete interconnected neurons. According to the most conventional 
sleep model, wake-promoting neurons (WPNs) and sleep-promoting neurons (SPNs) 
compete for network dominance, creating a systematic "switch" that results in 
either the sleep or awake state. WPNs and SPNs are ubiquitous in the brainstem 
and diencephalon, areas that together contain <1% of the neurons in the human 
brain. Interestingly, many of these WPNs and SPNs co-express and co-release 
various types of the neurotransmitters that often have opposing modulatory 
effects on the network. Co-transmission is often beneficial to structures with 
limited numbers of neurons because it provides increasing computational 
capability and flexibility. Moreover, co-transmission allows subcortical 
structures to bi-directionally control postsynaptic neurons, thus helping to 
orchestrate several complex physiological functions such as sleep. Here, we 
present an in-depth review of co-transmission in hypothalamic WPNs and SPNs and 
discuss its functional significance in the sleep-wake network.
