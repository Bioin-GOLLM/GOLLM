OBJECTIVE: Asthma is caused by a complex interaction between multiple genes and 
environmental factors. Herein we aimed to investigate whether signal transducer 
and activator of transcription (STAT2), toll-like receptors 4 (TLRs4) and 
CD40-related polymorphisms are associated with asthma susceptibility.
DESIGN: Children were divided: (1) asthma (n=117); (2) normal controls (n=60). 
The polymorphisms of STAT2, TLR4 and CD40 polymorphism were analyzed by PCR-RFLP 
genotyping. Genotypes, allelic frequencies and association of haplotypes in both 
groups were compared.
RESULTS: STAT2*C related genotypes, but not TLR4 and CD40 polymorphism, are 
associated with higher susceptibility for asthma. Distributions of 
STAT2*CC/CG/GG and C/G allele in both groups are: (1) 0/11.1/88.9 % and 
5.6/94.4%; (2) 0/1.7/98.3% and 0.8/99.2% (p<0.05). Proportions of 
TLR4*rs10983755 AA/AG/GG and rs1927914 CC/CT/TT homozygote are: (1) 
35.1/8.5/56.4% and 9.4/56.4/34.2%; (2) 35/8.3/56.7% and 16.7/48.3/35% 
(non-difference). Proportions of CD40*rs1883832 CC/CT/TT, rs3765459 AA/AG/GG, 
and rs4810485 TT/GT/GG are: (1) 29.9/53/17.1%, 6.8/47.9/45.3 and 
18.8/62.4/18.8%; (2) 36.7/41.7/21.6%, 1.6/46.7/ 51.7 and 15/51.7/33.3% 
(non-difference). Haplotype analyses for TLR4 and CD40 genes revealed their 
non-association and non-additional effect upon asthma susceptibilities.
CONCLUSION: STAT2*C related genotypes and alleles are associated with asthma 
susceptibilities and pathogenesis. There were non-association and non-additional 
effects of TLR4/CD40 gene polymorphisms and haplotypes upon asthma risk.
