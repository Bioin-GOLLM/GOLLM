Mutation in ABCA3, which is adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette member A3, a 
member of protein transporter family for phospholipids into the lamellar bodies 
during synthesis of surfactant, can cause lung disease related to surfactant 
dysfunction with autosomal recessive pattern. We reported three cases from same 
family with ABCA3 mutation, their gene, clinical course, and outcomes mentioning 
that one patient had successful lung transplantation, one started the process of 
the lung transplantation while the third one died during infancy. We concluded 
that the patients with ABCA3 gene mutations are increasing in numbers may be due 
to the availability of the genetic testing and high index of suspicion among 
physicians. Lung transplantation is the definitive treatment, but availability 
is limited in our region.
