Deciphering complex virus-host interactions is crucial for pandemic 
preparedness. In this study, we assessed the impact of recently postulated 
cellular factors ANP32A and ANP32B of influenza A virus (IAV) species 
specificity on viral pathogenesis in a genetically modified mouse model. 
Infection of ANP32A-/- and ANP32A+/+ mice with a seasonal H3N2 IAV or a highly 
pathogenic H5N1 human isolate did not result in any significant differences in 
virus tropism, innate immune response or disease outcome. However, infection of 
ANP32B-/- mice with H3N2 or H5N1 IAV revealed significantly reduced virus loads, 
inflammatory cytokine response and reduced pathogenicity compared to ANP32B+/+ 
mice. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses in ANP32B+/+ and ANP32B-/- mice further 
uncovered novel immune-regulatory pathways that correlate with reduced 
pathogenicity in the absence of ANP32B. These data show that ANP32B but not 
ANP32A promotes IAV pathogenesis in mice. Moreover, ANP32B might possess a yet 
unknown immune-modulatory function during IAV infection. Targeting ANP32B or its 
regulated pathways might therefore pose a new strategy to combat severe 
influenza.
