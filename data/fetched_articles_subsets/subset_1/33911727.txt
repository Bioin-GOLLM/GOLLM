Aquagenic wrinkling of the palms (AWP) is a rare condition, which is 
characterized by appearance of whitish papules and plaques and an excessive 
wrinkling and swelling of the palmar skin after exposure to water. Herein, we 
report two cases of AWP. A 17-year-old woman presented prickling focal various 
sized whitish papules, plaques with wrinkles on both palms after water contact 
for 6 months ago. Histologic findings were consistent with AWP. A 26-year-old 
woman presented asymptomatic multiple various sized whitish papules, plaques 
with wrinkles on both palms after water contact for 1 year ago. Both patients 
underwent a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduct receptor test but were 
negative and improved without any treatment.
