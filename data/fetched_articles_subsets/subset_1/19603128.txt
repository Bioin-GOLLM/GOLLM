Here, we employed the Hill equation, used broadly to characterize cooperativity 
in protein-ligand binding, to describe the dimerization of transmembrane (TM) 
helices in hydrophobic environments. The Hill analysis of wild-type fibroblast 
growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) TM domain dimerization gives a Hill coefficient 
of approximately 1 for lipid bilayers but only approximately 0.2 for sodium 
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles. We propose that this finding is indicative of 
heterogeneity in FGFR3 TM dimer structure and stability in SDS micelles. We 
further speculate that (1) the Hill equation can be used as a tool to assess the 
existence of multiple structural states of TM dimers in different hydrophobic 
environments and (2) the structural heterogeneity, detectable by Hill analysis, 
may be the underlying reason for the broad peaks and the low resolution NMR 
studies of peptides in detergents.
