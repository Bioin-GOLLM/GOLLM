BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, the age-related, progressive loss of skeletal muscle 
mass, strength, and function, is a considerable socioeconomic burden by 
increasing risks of falls, fractures, and frailty. Moreover, sarcopenic patients 
are often obese and therapeutic options are very limited.
METHODS: Here, we assessed the efficacy of espindolol on muscle mass in 
19-month-old male Wistar Han rats (weight, 555 ± 18 g), including safety issues. 
Rats were randomized to treatment with 3 mg/kg/day espindolol (n = 8) or placebo 
(n = 14) for 31 days.
RESULTS: Placebo-treated rats progressively lost body weight (-15.5 ± 7.2 g), 
lean mass (-1.5 ± 4.2 g), and fat mass (-15.6 ± 2.7 g), while espindolol 
treatment increased body weight (+8.0 ± 6.1 g, p < 0.05), particularly lean mass 
(+43.4 ± 3.5 g, p < 0.001), and reduced fat mass further (-38.6 ± 3.4 g, 
p < 0.001). Anabolic/catabolic signaling was assessed in gastrocnemius muscle. 
Espindolol decreased proteasome and caspase-3 proteolytic activities by 
approximately 50 % (all p < 0.05). Western blotting showed a reduced expression 
of key catabolic regulators, including NFκB, MuRF1, and LC-3 (all p < 0.01). The 
50- and 26-kDa forms of myostatin were downregulated fivefold and 20-fold, 
respectively (both p < 0.001). Moreover, 4E-BP-1 was reduced fivefold 
(p < 0.01), while phospho-PI3K was upregulated fivefold (p < 0.001), although 
Akt expression and phosphorylation were lower compared to placebo (all 
p < 0.05). No regulation of p38 and expression of ERK1/2 were observed, while 
phosphorylation of p38 was reduced (-54 %, p < 0.001) and ERK1/2 was increased 
(115 and 83 %, respectively, both p < 0.01). Espindolol did not affect cardiac 
function (echocardiography) or clinical plasma parameters.
CONCLUSION: Espindolol reversed the effects of aging/sarcopenia, particularly 
loss of muscle mass and increased fat mass. Thus, espindolol is an attractive 
candidate drug for the treatment of sarcopenia patients.
