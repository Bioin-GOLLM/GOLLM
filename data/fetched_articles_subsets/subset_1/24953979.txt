INTRODUCTION: Treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) yields tumour responses in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) patients harbouring activating EGFR mutations. However, even in 
long-lasting responses, resistance to EGFR TKIs invariably occurs.
AREAS COVERED: This review examines resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKI treatment, 
which mainly arise from secondary EGFR mutations. Other resistance-inducing 
processes include mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) amplification, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, phenotypic change from NSCLC to 
small-cell lung carcinoma, and modifications in parallel signalling pathways. 
Current therapeutic strategies to overcome these EGFR TKI resistance mechanisms 
focus on the inhibition or blocking of multiple members of the ErbB family. 
Several molecules which target multiple ErbB receptors are being investigated in 
NSCLC and other indications including afatinib, an ErbB Family Blocker, as well 
as dacomitinib and lapatinib. Novel, non-quinazoline, EGFR inhibitors, that also 
target EGFR activating and resistance (T790M) mutations, are currently under 
clinical development. Other therapeutic strategies include inhibition of 
parallel and downstream pathways, using agents which target heat shock protein 
(HSP)90 or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in addition to mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR), monoclonal antibodies against the insulin-like growth factor-1 
receptor, and fulvestrant-mediated oestrogen receptor regulation.
CONCLUSION: Improved understanding of mechanisms underlying resistance to EGFR 
TKIs emphasises the importance of a genotype-guided approach to therapy. 
Elucidation of resistance mechanisms is indeed crucial to target innovative 
therapeutic approaches and to improve the efficacy of anticancer regimes in 
NSCLC.
