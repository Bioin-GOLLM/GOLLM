BACKGROUND: The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism 
emerged as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little was known 
about its effects on the process of potential AD.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of the Val66Met polymorphism on cognition, 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and neuroimaging markers in non-demented elderly 
individuals.
METHODS: A total of 1,081 adults without dementia (375 healthy subjects and 706 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment) were recruited from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to test the influence of BDNF Val66Met 
polymorphism on cognitive impairment, brain structure atrophy, and change in the 
levels of CSF biomarkers. Moreover, we also conducted our study in abnormal 
amyloid-β (A+) subgroup and normal amyloid-β (A-) subgroup, as well as in APOEɛ4 
carriers and non-carriers.
RESULTS: The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism had significant association with atrophy 
of the entorhinal cortex and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the 
non-demented elderly and A + subgroup, while no association was found in 
A-subgroup. What is more, there was a significant effect of interaction between 
BDNF Val66Met and amyloid-β load in MMSE. In addition, significant associations 
of BDNF Val66Met with the entorhinal cortex and ventricular volumes were found 
among APOEɛ4 non-carriers, but not APOEɛ4 carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with cognitive 
impairment and brain atrophy among the non-demented elderly, APOEɛ4 non-carriers 
and A + subgroup, implying the potential of the Val66Met polymorphism as an 
important genetic factor for AD-related neurodegeneration.
