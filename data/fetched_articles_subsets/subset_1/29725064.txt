It is not known how total homocysteine (tHcy) levels change during the 
transition from acute stroke to post-stroke convalescence or whether tHcy 
changes occurring after the acute period are associated with recurrence of 
cerebro-cardiovascular events. Levels of tHcy were measured during acute 
ischemia and again after three months. Patients were followed for a median of 18 
(range: 12-36) months. A total of 2800 patients who had at least two tHcy 
measurements were enrolled between February 2012 and June 2014; 2587 patients 
presented with ischemic stroke and 213 presented with cerebral hemorrhage. 
During the follow-up period, 220 (7.9%) patients experienced another ischemic 
event. After adjusting for additional cardiovascular risk factors, patients with 
the highest levels of tHcy (fourth quartile; >15.5 μmol/L) had a 1.76-fold 
increased risk of a recurrence (adjusted HR: 1.76, 95%CI: 1.11-3.08) as compared 
to patients with the lowest levels of tHcy (lowest quartile; ≤9.65 μmol/L). 
Additional analysis by subgroup indicated that this correlation was only 
significant for patients with large-artery atherosclerosis ischemia (adjusted 
HR: 2.00, 95%CI: 1.13-3.55). Elevated tHcy during the convalescent phase of 
acute stroke was independently associated with an increased risk of recurrent 
ischemic stroke, especially in those patients with large-vessel atherosclerosis 
ischemia.
