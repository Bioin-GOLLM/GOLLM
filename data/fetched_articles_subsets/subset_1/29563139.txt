Purpose: Telomerase promoter mutations are highly prevalent in human tumors 
including melanoma. A subset of patients with metastatic melanoma often fail 
multiple therapies, and there is an unmet and urgent need to prolong disease 
control for those patients.Experimental Design: Numerous preclinical 
therapy-resistant models of human and mouse melanoma were used to test the 
efficacy of a telomerase-directed nucleoside, 6-thio-2'-deoxyguanosine 
(6-thio-dG). Integrated transcriptomics and proteomics approaches were used to 
identify genes and proteins that were significantly downregulated by 
6-thio-dG.Results: We demonstrated the superior efficacy of 6-thio-dG both in 
vitro and in vivo that results in telomere dysfunction, leading to apoptosis and 
cell death in various preclinical models of therapy-resistant melanoma cells. 
6-thio-dG concomitantly induces telomere dysfunction and inhibits the expression 
level of AXL.Conclusions: In summary, this study shows that indirectly targeting 
aberrant telomerase in melanoma cells with 6-thio-dG is a viable therapeutic 
approach in prolonging disease control and overcoming therapy resistance. Clin
