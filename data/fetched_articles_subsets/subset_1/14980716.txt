Myeloperoxidase (MPO; EC 1.11.1.7) plays an important role in the host defense 
mechanism against microbial diseases. The neutrophil disorder characterized by 
the lack of MPO activity, is speculated to be associated with a decreased level 
of immunity. A Japanese patient was identified with complete MPO deficiency 
through automated hematography. Neutrophil function analysis revealed that MPO 
activity was significantly diminished with slightly elevated superoxide 
production. Mutational analysis of the patient revealed a glycine to serine 
substitution (G501S) in the exon 9 region. This mutation was not detected in the 
96 healthy controls analyzed. The amino acid substitution found may be 
responsible for the failure of mature MPO production in the patient. This is the 
first case of MPO deficiency of G501S missense mutation identified in a Japanese 
patient.
