Lysosomes are cell organelles that degrade macromolecules to recycle their 
components. If lysosomal degradative function is impaired, e.g., due to 
mutations in lysosomal enzymes or membrane proteins, lysosomal storage diseases 
(LSDs) can develop. LSDs manifest often with neurodegenerative symptoms, 
typically starting in early childhood, and going along with a strongly reduced 
life expectancy and quality of life. We show here that small molecule activation 
of the Ca2+ -permeable endolysosomal two-pore channel 2 (TPC2) results in an 
amelioration of cellular phenotypes associated with LSDs such as cholesterol or 
lipofuscin accumulation, or the formation of abnormal vacuoles seen by electron 
microscopy. Rescue effects by TPC2 activation, which promotes lysosomal 
exocytosis and autophagy, were assessed in mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV), 
Niemann-Pick type C1, and Batten disease patient fibroblasts, and in neurons 
derived from newly generated isogenic human iPSC models for MLIV and Batten 
disease. For in vivo proof of concept, we tested TPC2 activation in the MLIV 
mouse model. In sum, our data suggest that TPC2 is a promising target for the 
treatment of different types of LSDs, both in vitro and in-vivo.
