Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are 
crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the 
specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie 
in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that 
signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells 
by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or 
lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control 
the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, 
differentiation and metabolism.
