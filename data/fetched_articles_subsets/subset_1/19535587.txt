RGS7, RGS11, and their binding partner Gbeta5 are localized to the dendritic 
tips of retinal ON bipolar cells (ON-BPC), where mGluR6 responds to glutamate 
released from photoreceptor terminals by activation of the RGS7/RGS11 substrate, 
Galphao. To determine their functions in retinal signaling, we investigated 
cell-specific expression patterns of RGS7 and RGS11 by immunostaining, and 
measured light responses by electroretinography in mice with targeted 
disruptions of the genes encoding them. RGS7 staining is present in dendritic 
tips of all rod ON-BPC, but missing in those for subsets of cone ON-BPC, whereas 
the converse was true for RGS11 staining. Genetic disruption of either RGS7 or 
RGS11 produced delays in the ON-BPC-derived electroretinogram b-wave, but no 
changes in the photoreceptor-derived a-wave. Homozygous RGS7 mutant mice had 
delays in rod-driven b-waves, whereas RGS11 mutant mice had delays in 
rod-driven, and especially in cone-driven b-waves. The b-wave delays were 
further enhanced in mice homozygous for both RGS7 and RGS11 gene disruptions. 
Thus, RGS7 and RGS11 act in parallel to regulate the kinetics of ON bipolar cell 
responses, with differential impacts on the rod and cone pathways.
