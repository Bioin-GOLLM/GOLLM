Here we report on a case of MYH7-related myopathy in a boy with early onset of 
muscular weakness and delayed motor development in infancy. His most affected 
muscles were neck extensors showing a dropped head sign, proximal muscles of 
lower limbs with positive Gower's sign, and trunk muscles. Brain and spinal cord 
MRI scans, echocardiography, and laboratory analyses including creatine kinase 
and lactate did not reveal any abnormalities. Muscle histopathology showed 
fiber-type disproportion. Whole exome sequencing of the parents-offspring trio 
revealed a novel de novo c.5655G>A p.(Ala1885=) synonymous substitution of the 
last nucleotide in exon 38 of the MYH7 gene. Further RNA investigations proved 
the skipping of exon 38 (p.1854_1885del). This is a first report of an 
exon-skipping mutation in the MYH7 gene causing myopathy. This report broadens 
both the phenotypic and genotypic spectra of MYH7-related myopathies.
