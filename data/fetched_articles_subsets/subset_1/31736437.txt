BACKGROUND: Clinical glioblastoma treatment mostly focuses on the 
contrast-enhancing tumor mass. Amino acid positron emission tomography (PET) can 
detect additional, nonenhancing glioblastoma-infiltrated brain regions that are 
difficult to distinguish on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We 
combined MRI with perfusion imaging and amino acid PET to evaluate such 
nonenhancing glioblastoma regions.
METHODS: Structural MRI, relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps from 
perfusion MRI, and α-[11C]-methyl-l-tryptophan (AMT)-PET images were analyzed in 
20 patients with glioblastoma. The AMT uptake and rCBV (expressed as tumor to 
normal [T/N] ratios) were compared in nonenhancing tumor portions showing 
increased signal on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2/FLAIR) images.
RESULTS: Thirteen (65%) tumors showed robust heterogeneity in nonenhancing 
T2/FLAIR hyperintense areas on AMT-PET, whereas the nonenhancing regions in the 
remaining 7 cases had homogeneous AMT uptake (low in 6, high in 1). AMT and rCBV 
T/N ratios showed only a moderate correlation in the nonenhancing regions (r = 
0.41, P = .017), but regions with very low rCBV (<0.79 T/N ratio) had invariably 
low AMT uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the metabolic and perfusion heterogeneity 
of nonenhancing T2/FLAIR hyperintense glioblastoma regions. Amino acid PET 
imaging of such regions can detect glioma-infiltrated brain for treatment 
targeting; however, very low rCBV values outside the contrast-enhancing tumor 
mass make increased AMT uptake in nonenhancing glioblastoma regions unlikely.
