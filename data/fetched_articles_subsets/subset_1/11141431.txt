Mutations in the rhodopsin cause of retinitis pigmentosa autosomal dominant 
(ADRP). We report a large family affected with ADRP. Analysis by denaturant 
gradient gel electrophoresis and direct DNA sequence detected an heterozygous G 
to T transversion in the exon 3 of the rhodopsin gene. This mutation damages a 
restriction site for Taq I enzyme and produces the change Asp-190-Tyr in 
rhodopsin. All carriers of the mutation show a regional RP phenotype. This 
mutation is responsible for the disease in this family.
