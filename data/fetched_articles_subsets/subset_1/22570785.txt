The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway plays a central role in 
regulating the host inflammatory response. The net effect can either be pro- or 
anti-inflammatory depending on the system and cellular context studied. This 
paper focuses on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in innate and adaptive 
immune cells of the intestinal mucosa. The role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
signaling in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease is also discussed. With 
the development of new isoform specific inhibitors, we are beginning to 
understand the specific role of this complex pathway, in particular the role of 
the Î³ isoform in intestinal inflammation. Continued research on this complex 
pathway will enhance our understanding of its role and provide rationale for the 
design of new approaches to intervention in chronic inflammatory conditions such 
as inflammatory bowel disease.
