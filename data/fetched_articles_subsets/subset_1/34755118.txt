Neuronal loss resulting from progressive neurodegeneration is a major 
pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we present a protocol to 
detect neurodegeneration, neuronal apoptosis, and neuronal loss in 5XFAD mouse 
strain, which is a well-established model for interrogating the molecular 
mechanism of neuronal death in AD. This protocol describes the use of the 
neurodegenerative marker Fluro-Jade C, cleaved caspase-3 immunofluorescent 
staining and Nissl staining for the analysis of neurodegeneration and neuronal 
loss in 5XFAD mice. For complete details on the use and execution of this 
protocol, please refer to Zhang et al. (2021).
