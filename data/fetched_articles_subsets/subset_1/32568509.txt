Activating mutations in the small GTPase NRAS are responsible for driving tumor 
growth in several cancers. Unfortunately, the development of NRAS inhibitors has 
proven difficult due to the lack of hydrophobic binding pockets on the protein's 
surface. To overcome this limitation, we chose to target the post-translational 
S-palmitoyl modification of NRAS, which is required for its signaling activity. 
Utilizing an amphiphile-mediated depalmitoylation (AMD) strategy, we demonstrate 
the ability to directly cleave S-palmitoyl groups from NRAS and inhibit its 
function. C8 alkyl cysteine causes a dose-dependent decrease in NRAS 
palmitoylation and inhibits downstream signaling in melanoma cells with an 
activating mutation in NRAS. This compound reduces cell growth in NRAS-driven 
versus non-NRAS-driven melanoma lines and inhibits tumor progression in an 
NRAS-mutated melanoma xenograft mouse model. Our work demonstrates that AMD can 
effectively suppress NRAS activity and could represent a promising new avenue 
for discovering lead compounds for treatment of NRAS-driven cancers.
