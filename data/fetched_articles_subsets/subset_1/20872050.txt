PURPOSE: Ultrasound can be used to release a therapeutic payload encapsulated 
within a perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion via acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV), 
a process whereby the PFC phase is vaporized and the agent is released. 
ADV-generated microbubbles have been previously used to selectively occlude 
blood vessels in vivo. The coupling of ADV-generated drug delivery and occlusion 
has therapeutically synergistic potentials.
METHODS: Micron-sized, water-in-PFC-in-water (W(1)/PFC/W(2)) emulsions were 
prepared in a two-step process using perfluoropentane (PFP) or perfluorohexane 
(PFH) as the PFC phase. Fluorescein or thrombin was contained in the W(1) phase.
RESULTS: Double emulsions containing fluorescein in the W(1) phase displayed a 
5.7±1.4-fold and 8.2±1.3-fold increase in fluorescein mass flux, as measured 
using a Franz diffusion cell, after ADV for the PFP and PFH emulsions, 
respectively. Thrombin was stably retained in four out of five double emulsions. 
For three out of five formulations tested, the clotting time of whole blood 
decreased, in a statistically significant manner (p < 0.01), when incubated with 
thrombin-loaded emulsions exposed to ultrasound compared to emulsions not 
exposed to ultrasound.
CONCLUSIONS: ADV can be used to spatially and temporally control the delivery of 
water-soluble compounds formulated in PFC double emulsions. Thrombin release 
could extend the duration of ADV-generated, microbubble occlusions.
