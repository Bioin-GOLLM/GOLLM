The catalytic mechanisms of sulfite oxidizing enzymes (SOEs) have been 
investigated by multi-frequency pulsed EPR measurements of "difficult" magnetic 
nuclei (35.37Cl, 33S, 17O) associated with the Mo(v) center. Extensive DFT 
calculations have been used to relate the experimental magnetic resonance 
parameters of these nuclei to specific active site structures. This combined 
spectroscopic and computational approach has provided new insights concerning 
the structure/function relationships of the active sites of SOEs, including: (i) 
the exchange of oxo ligands; (ii) the nature of the blocked forms; and (iii) the 
role of Cl- in low pH forms.
