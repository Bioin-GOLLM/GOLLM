We report the case of a 79-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
with IgM-kappa type monoclonal gammopathy according to immunophenotypes and a 
negative result for MYD88 L265P mutation of leukemic cells. Abnormal lymphocytes 
and IgM increased under observation, and he experienced paresthesia. The 
diagnosis of IgM-type M protein associated peripheral neuropathy was confirmed 
by nerve conduction test, and negativity of myelin-associated glycoprotein and 
glycolipid antibodies. He was placed on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in 
combination with ibrutinib. His symptoms dramatically subsided and did not 
recur. Treatment with IVIg and ibrutinib may be useful for the rare complication 
of peripheral neuropathy with CLL.
