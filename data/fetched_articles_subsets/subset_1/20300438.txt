Myostatin is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 
superfamily that functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle 
development and growth. Myostatin blockade therefore offers a strategy for 
promoting muscle growth in livestock production without resorting to genetic 
manipulation. In this report, we examined the effect of myostatin inhibition by 
plasmid-mediated delivery of a mutant myostatin propeptide (MProD76A), a natural 
inhibitor of myostatin, on the growth performance of mice. A significant 
increase in skeletal muscle mass was observed after a single intramuscular 
injection of naked plasmid DNA encoding MProD76A into mice. Enhanced muscle 
growth occurred because of myofiber hypertrophy, but no cardiac muscle 
hypertrophy and organomegaly was observed in the mice after myostatin inhibition 
by plasmid-mediated MProD76A delivery. These results demonstrate a promising 
approach to enhancing muscle growth that warrants further investigation in 
domestic animals.
