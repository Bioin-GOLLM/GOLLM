By interacting with the mRNA 5' cap, the translation initiation factor eIF4E 
plays a critical role in selecting mRNAs for protein synthesis in eukaryotic 
cells. Caf20 is a member of the family of proteins found across eukaryotes 
termed 4E-BPs, which compete with eIF4G for interaction with eIF4E. Caf20 
independently interacts with ribosomes. Thus, Caf20 modulates the mRNA selection 
process via poorly understood mechanisms. Here we performed unbiased mutagenesis 
across Caf20 to characterise which regions of Caf20 are important for 
interaction with eIF4E and with ribosomes. Caf20 binding to eIF4E is entirely 
dependent on a canonical motif shared with other 4E-BPs. However, binding to 
ribosomes is weakened by mutations throughout the protein, suggesting an 
extended binding interface that partially overlaps with the eIF4E-interaction 
region. By using chemical crosslinking, we identify a potential ribosome 
interaction region on the ribosome surface that spans both small and large 
subunits and is close to a known interaction site of eIF3. The function of 
ribosome binding by Caf20 remains unclear.
