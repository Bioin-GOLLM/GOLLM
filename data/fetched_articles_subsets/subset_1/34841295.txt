Cell-based immunotherapy has become the new-generation cancer medicine, and 
"off-the-shelf" cell products that can be manufactured at large scale and 
distributed readily to treat patients are necessary. Invariant natural killer T 
(iNKT) cells are ideal cell carriers for developing allogeneic cell therapy 
because they are powerful immune cells targeting cancers without 
graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) risk. However, healthy donor blood contains 
extremely low numbers of endogenous iNKT cells. Here, by combining hematopoietic 
stem cell (HSC) gene engineering and in vitro differentiation, we generate human 
allogeneic HSC-engineered iNKT (AlloHSC-iNKT) cells at high yield and purity; 
these cells closely resemble endogenous iNKT cells, effectively target tumor 
cells using multiple mechanisms, and exhibit high safety and low immunogenicity. 
These cells can be further engineered with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to 
enhance tumor targeting or/and gene edited to ablate surface human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) molecules and further reduce immunogenicity. Collectively, these 
preclinical studies demonstrate the feasibility and cancer therapy potential of 
AlloHSC-iNKT cell products and lay a foundation for their translational and 
clinical development.
