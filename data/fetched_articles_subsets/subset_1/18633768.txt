We hypothesized that genetic variations of cytokines could contribute to the 
risk of developing a fatal immunological reaction in the heart of infants. Thus, 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-10 gene polymorphisms 
versus induction of cardioimmunologxical responses in victims of sudden infant 
death syndrome (SIDS) were explored. We genotyped 35 infants (23 cases of SIDS 
and 12 infants with a known cause of death), and 100 healthy adult controls for 
IL-10 -1082 G/A, -592 C/A and TNF-alpha-238 G/A, -308 G/A. We found a higher 
frequency of the ATA haplotype and ATA/ATA genotype of IL-10 associated with 
SIDS (13%). The frequency of homozygote infants for IL-10 haplotypes in SIDS was 
higher (52%) than the control group (34%). All SIDS cases were homozygotice for 
the TNF-alpha-238 G allele and 20 infants were homozygous for the TNF-alpha-308 
G allele in the same group. None of the infants with higher levels of 
infiltrated T-cells (n=8) was homozygous for IL-10 gene polymorphisms, whereas 
in contrast 3 cases of the 6 that displayed higher levels of cardiac mast cells 
were homozygous. In this study, the increased number of interstitial T-cells, 
mast cells, and macrophages in the myocardial interstitium demonstrated no 
correlation with the genotype for either cytokines.
