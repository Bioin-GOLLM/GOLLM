In this study, four malonyl isoflavonoid glycosides (MIGs), a type of 
isoflavonoid with poor structural stability, were efficiently isolated and 
purified from Astragali Radix by a medium pressure ODS C18 column 
chromatography. The structures of the four compounds were determined on the 
basis of NMR and literature analysis. Their major diagnostic fragment ions and 
fragmentation pathways were proposed in ESI/Q-TOF/MS positive mode. Using a 
target precursor ions scan, a total of 26 isoflavonoid compounds, including 
eleven malonyl isoflavonoid glycosides coupled with eight related isoflavonoid 
glycosides and seven aglycones were characterized from the methanolic extract of 
Astragali Radix. To clarify the relationship of MIGs and the ratio of 
transformation in Astragali Radix under different extraction conditions, two 
MIGs (calycosin-7-O-glycoside-6″-O-malonate and 
formononetin-7-O-glycoside-6″-O-malonate) coupled with related glycosides 
(calycosin-7-O-glycoside and formononetin-7-O-glycoside) and aglycones 
(calycosin and formononetin) were detected by a comprehensive HPLC-UV method. 
Results showed that MIGs could convert into related glycosides under elevated 
temperature conditions, which was further confirmed by the conversion experiment 
of MIGs reference compounds. Moreover, the total contents of MIGs and related 
glycosides displayed no obvious change during the long-duration extraction. 
These findings indicated that the quality of Astragali Radix could be evaluated 
efficiently and accurately by using the total content of MIGs and related 
glycosides as the quality index.
