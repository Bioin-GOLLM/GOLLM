Rare inherited bleeding disorders (IBD) are a common cause of bleeding tendency. 
To ensure a correct diagnosis, specialized laboratory analyses are necessary. 
This study reports the results of an upfront diagnostic strategy using targeted 
whole exome sequencing. In total, 156 patients with a significant bleeding 
assessment tool score participated in the study, of which a third had 
thrombocytopenia. Eighty-seven genes specifically associated with genetic 
predisposition to bleeding were analysed by whole exome sequencing. Variants 
were classified according to the five-tier scheme. We identified 353 germline 
variants. Eight patients (5%) harboured a known pathogenic variant. Of the 345 
previously unknown variants, computational analyses predicted 99 to be 
significant. Further filtration according to the Mendelian inheritance pattern, 
resulted in 59 variants being predicted to be clinically significant. Moreover, 
34% (20/59) were assigned as novel class 4 or 5 variants upon targeted 
functional testing. A class 4 or 5 variant was identified in 30% of patients 
with thrombocytopenia (14/47) versus 11% of patients with a normal platelet 
count (12/109) (P < 0·01). An IBD diagnosis has a major clinical impact. The 
genetic investigations detailed here extricated our patients from a diagnostic 
conundrum, thus demonstrating that continuous optimization of the diagnostic 
work-up of IBD is of great benefit.
