The Flavivirus genus is in the family Flaviviridae and is comprised of more than 
70 viruses. These viruses have a broad geographic range, circulating on every 
continent except Antarctica. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as yellow fever 
virus, dengue virus serotypes 1-4, Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile 
virus are responsible for significant human morbidity and mortality in affected 
regions. This review focuses on what is known about flavivirus-mosquito 
interactions and presents key data collected from the field and laboratory-based 
molecular and ultrastructural evaluations.
