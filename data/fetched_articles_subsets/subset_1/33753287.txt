Cellular senescence occurs in response to diverse stresses (e.g., telomere 
shortening, DNA damage, oxidative stress, oncogene activation). A growing body 
of evidence indicates that alterations in multiple components of endocytic 
pathways contribute to cellular senescence. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) 
and caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CavME) represent major types of endocytosis 
that are implicated in senescence. More recent research has also identified a 
chromatin modifier and tumor suppressor that contributes to the induction of 
senescence via altered endocytosis. Here, molecular regulators of aberrant 
endocytosis-induced senescence are reviewed and discussed in the context of 
their capacity to serve as senescence-inducing stressors or modifiers.
