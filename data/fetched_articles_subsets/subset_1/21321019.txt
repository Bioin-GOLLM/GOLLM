The standard genetic code is used by most living organisms, yet deviations have 
been observed in many genomes, suggesting that the genetic code has been 
evolving. In certain yeast mitochondria, CUN codons are reassigned from leucine 
to threonine, which requires an unusual tRNA(Thr) with an enlarged 8-nt 
anticodon loop ( ). To trace its evolutionary origin we performed a 
comprehensive phylogenetic analysis which revealed that evolved from yeast 
mitochondrial tRNA(His). To understand this tRNA identity change, we performed 
mutational and biochemical experiments. We show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase (MST1) could attach threonine to both and 
the regular , but not to the wild-type tRNA(His). A loss of the first nucleotide 
(G(-1)) in tRNA(His) converts it to a substrate for MST1 with a K(m) value 
(0.7 μM) comparable to that of (0.3 μM), and addition of G(-1) to allows 
efficient histidylation by histidyl-tRNA synthetase. We also show that MST1 from 
Candida albicans, a yeast in which CUN codons remain assigned to leucine, could 
not threonylate , suggesting that MST1 has coevolved with . Our work provides 
the first clear example of a recent recoding event caused by alloacceptor tRNA 
gene recruitment.
