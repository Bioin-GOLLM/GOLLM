In inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, cytokines and danger 
signals are sensed by the central nervous system, which adapts behavior and 
physiologic responses during systemic stress. The central nervous system can 
also signal the periphery to modulate inflammation through efferent hormonal and 
neuronal pathways. The brain and spinal cord are involved in this bidirectional 
interaction. A variety of neuronal pathways that modulate synovial inflammation 
have been implicated, including the sympathetic and the parasympathetic branches 
of the autonomic system. Another mechanism, the dorsal root reflex, involves 
antidromic signaling along somatic afferent fibers that influences joint 
inflammation by releasing neuropeptides and other neuromediators in the 
periphery. Some of the neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors involved have been 
identified in preclinical models and represent novel targets for the treatment 
of rheumatic diseases.
