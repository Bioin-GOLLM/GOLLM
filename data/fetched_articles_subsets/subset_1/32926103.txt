PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify genetic variants on 
chromosome X associated with intraocular pressure (IOP) and determine if they 
possess any sex-specific effects.
METHODS: Association analyses were performed across chromosome X using 102,407 
participants from the UK Biobank. Replication and validation analyses were 
conducted in an additional 6599 participants from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort, and 
an independent 331,682 participants from the UK Biobank.
RESULTS: We identified three loci associated with IOP at genomewide significance 
(P < 5 × 10-8), located within or near the following genes: MXRA5 (rs2107482, P 
= 7.1 × 10-11), GPM6B (rs66819623, P = 6.9 × 10-10), NDP, and EFHC2 (rs12558081, 
P = 4.9 × 10-11). Alleles associated with increased IOP were also associated 
with increased risk for primary open-angle glaucoma in an independent sample. 
Finally, our results indicate that chromosome X genetics most likely do not 
illicit sex-specific effects on IOP.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we report the results of genomewide levels of 
association of three loci on chromosome X with IOP, and provide a framework to 
include chromosome X in large-scale genomewide association analyses for complex 
phenotypes.
