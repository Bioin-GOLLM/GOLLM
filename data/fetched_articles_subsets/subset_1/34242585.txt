In ribosomopathies, perturbed expression of ribosome components leads to 
tissue-specific phenotypes. What accounts for such tissue-selective 
manifestations as a result of mutations in the ribosome, a ubiquitous cellular 
machine, has remained a mystery. Combining mouse genetics and in vivo ribosome 
profiling, we observe limb-patterning phenotypes in ribosomal protein (RP) 
haploinsufficient embryos, and we uncover selective translational changes of 
transcripts that controlling limb development. Surprisingly, both loss of p53, 
which is activated by RP haploinsufficiency, and augmented protein synthesis 
rescue these phenotypes. These findings are explained by the finding that p53 
functions as a master regulator of protein synthesis, at least in part, through 
transcriptional activation of 4E-BP1. 4E-BP1, a key translational regulator, in 
turn, facilitates selective changes in the translatome downstream of p53, and 
this thereby explains how RP haploinsufficiency may elicit specificity to gene 
expression. These results provide an integrative model to help understand how 
in vivo tissue-specific phenotypes emerge in ribosomopathies.
