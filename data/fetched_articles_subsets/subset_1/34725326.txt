Aptamers represent a potentially important class of ligands for the development 
of diagnostics and therapeutics. However, it is often difficult to compare the 
function and specificity of many of these molecules as assay formats and 
conditions vary greatly. Here, with an interest in developing aptamer targeted 
therapeutics that could effectively deliver cargoes to cells, we chemically 
synthesize 15 aptamers that have been reported to target cell surface receptors 
or cells. Using standardized assay conditions, we assess each aptamer's binding 
properties on a panel of 11 different cancer cell lines, correlate aptamer 
binding to antibody controls and use siRNA transfection to validate each 
aptamer's binding to reported target receptors. Using a subset of these 
molecules known to be expressed on prostate cancers, we use near-infrared in 
vivo imaging to assess the tumor localization following intravenous injection. 
Our data demonstrate some surprising differences in the reported specificity and 
function for many of these molecules and raise concerns regarding their cell 
targeting capabilities. They also identify an anti-human transferrin aptamer, 
Waz, as a robust candidate for targeting prostate cancers and for future 
development of aptamer-based therapeutics.
