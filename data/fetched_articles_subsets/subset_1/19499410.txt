BACKGROUND: 17-Hydroxylase deficiency is a rare form of congenital adrenal 
hyperplasia caused by CYP17A1 gene mutations.
METHOD: A 46,XY and a 46,XX Chinese patients with 17-hydroxylase deficiency in a 
family and their four generations family members were genotyped by 
PCR-sequencing method.
RESULTS: Two CYP17 gene mutations were identified from these patients. Among 
them, IVS1-1G > A was a novel splicing mutation which disrupted the acceptor 
signal of exon 2 and might create a new exon after exon 1. The indel mutation of 
TAC329AA was a one-base deletion mutation and one-base change at codon 329 in 
exon 6.
CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the diagnosis of 17-hydroxylase deficiency in 
these two patients and their autosome recessive heritage mode. The TAC329AA 
indel mutation had been identified in several reports of Chinese and Asian, 
suggesting that codon 329 was an unstable point of the CYP17 gene and this 
mutation was a prevalent CYP17 mutation in the Asian population. Although the 
noval mutation IVS1-1G > A founded in this family need more study to know its 
machinism of interrupting P450c17 function.
