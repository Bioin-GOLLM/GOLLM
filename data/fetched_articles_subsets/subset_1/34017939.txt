Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in 
adults over 60 years old globally. There are two forms of advanced AMD: "dry" 
and "wet". Dry AMD is characterized by geographic atrophy of the retinal pigment 
epithelium and overlying photoreceptors in the macular region; whereas wet AMD 
is characterized by vascular penetrance from the choroid into the retina, known 
as choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Both phenotypes eventually lead to loss 
of central vision. The pathogenesis of AMD involves the interplay of genetic 
polymorphisms and environmental risk factors, many of which elevate retinal 
oxidative stress. Excess reactive oxygen species react with cellular 
macromolecules, forming oxidation-modified byproducts that elicit chronic 
inflammation and promote CNV. Additionally, genome-wide association studies have 
identified several genetic variants in the age-related maculopathy 
susceptibility 2/high-temperature requirement A serine peptidase 1 (ARMS2-HTRA1) 
locus associated with the progression of late-stage AMD, especially the wet 
subtype. In this review, we will focus on the interplay of oxidative stress and 
HTRA1 in drusen deposition, chronic inflammation, and chronic angiogenesis. We 
aim to present a multifactorial model of wet AMD progression, supporting HTRA1 
as a novel therapeutic target upstream of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), the conventional target in AMD therapeutics. By inhibiting HTRA1's 
proteolytic activity, we can reduce pro-angiogenic signaling and prevent 
proteolytic breakdown of the blood-retina barrier. The anti-HTRA1 approach 
offers a promising alternative treatment option to wet AMD, complementary to 
anti-VEGF therapy.
