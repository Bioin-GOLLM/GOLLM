BACKGROUND: Serological response and association to clinical manifestation is 
important for understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted where 
antibody responses of IgG and IgA towards SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were studied 
over time in patients with COVID-19. Possible associations between antibody 
titers and outcome were analyzed.
RESULTS: Forty patients with COVID-19, hospitalized at Skåne University 
hospital, Sweden, between April and June 2020 were included. IgG antibody 
responses were detected for all patients with the highest levels four weeks 
after COVID-19 diagnosis. Levels of IgA were generally higher at diagnosis and 
decreased towards baseline 4 weeks after confirmed COVID-19. Patients with 
severe COVID-19 had higher levels of antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 
spike protein compared with patients with mild disease.
CONCLUSION: IgG and IgA antibodies towards the spike protein follow different 
kinetics during COVID-19 and patients with severe disease develop higher 
antibody levels.
