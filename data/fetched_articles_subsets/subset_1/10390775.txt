INTRODUCTION: Activated protein C resistance is the most common hereditary 
coagulation abnormality. In the majority of cases it results from a point 
mutation Arg506-->Gln of the factor V gene, and characterized by a poor 
anticoagulant response to activated protein C.
CLINICAL CASE: We report the clinical case of a 6-year-old obese boy, who 
presented with acute hemiparesis. A cerebral MRI revealed an area of infarction 
in the left hemiprotuberance. Further investigation identified activated protein 
C resistance (heterozygosity for factor V Leiden) and elevation in lipoprotein 
(a). His mother also had factor V Leiden mutation. Prophylaxis with 
acetylsalicylic acid was instituted with favorable evolution.
CONCLUSIONS: This mutation, isolated, is usually asymptomatic, unless other risk 
factors coexist. Although venous thromboembolism seems to be the main clinical 
manifestation, recent reports consider that activated protein C resistance is 
also a risk factor for arterial thrombosis and stroke in children. We reinforce 
the need for systematic and thorough evaluation of etiology and risk factors in 
cases of stroke in children.
