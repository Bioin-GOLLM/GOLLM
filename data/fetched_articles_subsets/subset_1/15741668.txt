The diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase 1 gene (DGAT1) was investigated in Polish 
Black-and-White cattle. The frequency of the K allele was 0.60, 0.68 and 0.48 
for AI sires (n=150), young bulls (n=139) and cows (n=213), respectively. The 
method of selective genotyping for identification of the quantitative trait 
nucleotide was verified through identification of DGAT1 effect on milk 
production traits. Daughters of six heterozygous bulls were selectively 
genotyped based on their milk traits. The genotypic frequencies differed between 
high and low yield groups representing milk and fat contents. The Kruskal-Wallis 
test revealed a highly significant effect of DGAT1 K232A in cows with extremely 
low fat content and a significant effect in cows with extremely high protein 
content of milk. No significant effect of AI sires' genotypes on their breeding 
value was found.
