The recognition that only a small percentage of known human gene products are 
druggable using traditional modes of non-covalent ligand design, has led to a 
resurgence in targeted covalent inhibitors. Covalent inhibitors offer advantages 
over non-covalent inhibitors in engaging otherwise challenging targets. Reactive 
cysteine residues on proteins are a common target for covalent inhibitors, 
whereby the high nucleophilicity of the cysteine thiol under physiological 
conditions provides an ideal anchoring site for electrophilic small molecules. A 
chemical-proteomic platform, termed isoTOP-ABPP, allows for profiling cysteine 
reactivity in complex proteomes and is one of many techniques that can aid in 
two aspects of the covalent-inhibitor development process: (1) to identify 
functional cysteines that lead to modulation of protein activity through 
covalent modification; and, (2) to determine cellular targets and evaluate 
promiscuity of electrophilic fragments, small molecules, and natural products. 
Herein, we discuss recent advances in isoTOP-ABPP and potential applications of 
this technology in the drug-discovery pipeline.
