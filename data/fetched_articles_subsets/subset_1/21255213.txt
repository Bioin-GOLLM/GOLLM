The ability to study proteins in live cells using genetically encoded 
fluorescent proteins (FPs) has revolutionized cell biology (1-3). Researchers 
have created numerous FP biosensors and optimized FPs for specific organisms and 
subcellular environments in a rainbow of colors (4,5). However, expressing FPs 
in oxidizing environments such as the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or 
the bacterial periplasm can impair folding, thereby preventing fluorescence 
(6,7). A substantial fraction of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 
oligomerizes to form non-fluorescent mixed disulfides in the ER (6) and EGFP 
does not fluoresce in the periplasm when targeted via the SecYEG translocon (7). 
To overcome these obstacles, we exploited the highly efficient folding 
capability of superfolder GFP (sfGFP) (8). Here, we report sfGFP does not form 
disulfide-linked oligomers in the ER and maltose-binding protein (MBP) signal 
sequence (peri)-sfGFP (9) is brightly fluorescent in the periplasm of 
Escherichia coli. Thus, sfGFP represents an important research tool for studying 
resident proteins of oxidizing environments.
