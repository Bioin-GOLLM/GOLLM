BACKGROUND: Tazemetostat (EPZ-6438) is a selective inhibitor of the histone 
methyltransferase EZH2 and currently in clinical development for non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma and genetically defined tumors.
PROCEDURES: Tazemetostat was tested against the Pediatric Preclinical Testing 
Program (PPTP) solid tumor xenografts using a dose of 400 mg/kg administered 
twice daily by oral gavage for 28 days. H3K27me3:H3 ratios were determined in 
control and treated tumors.
RESULTS: Tazemetostat induced significant differences in event-free survival 
(EFS) distribution compared with control in nine of 30 (30%) of the xenografts 
studied. Significant differences in EFS distribution were observed in five of 
seven (71%) rhabdoid tumor xenograft lines compared with four of 23 (17%) 
nonrhabdoid xenograft lines (chi-square [χ2 ] test P = 0.006). Tazemetostat 
induced tumor growth inhibition meeting criteria for intermediate and high EFS 
treated-to-control (T/C) activity in two of 25 (8%) and one of 25 (4%) 
xenografts, respectively. Intermediate and high activity for the EFS T/C metric 
was observed exclusively among rhabdoid tumor xenografts (three of five rhabdoid 
tumor vs 0 of 22 nonrhabdoid tumors (χ² test P < 0.001). One rhabdoid tumor 
xenograft (G401) showed stable disease. For one rhabdoid tumor (G401), delayed 
tumor regression to tazemetostat was noted following 1 week of tumor growth. 
Tazemetostat induced significant reduction of H3K27me3 levels in the majority of 
tumors compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Tazemetostat demonstrated significant antitumor activity in 
rhabdoid tumor models but showed no consistent activity against any other 
histology. Tazemetostat reduced H3K27me3 levels irrespective of tumor response. 
Further preclinical testing to evaluate tazemetostat in combination with other 
anticancer agents is warranted.
