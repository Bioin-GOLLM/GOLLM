Although classically appreciated for their role as the powerhouse of the cell, 
the metabolic functions of mitochondria reach far beyond bioenergetics. In this 
Review, we discuss how mitochondria catabolize nutrients for energy, generate 
biosynthetic precursors for macromolecules, compartmentalize metabolites for the 
maintenance of redox homeostasis and function as hubs for metabolic waste 
management. We address the importance of these roles in both normal physiology 
and in disease.
