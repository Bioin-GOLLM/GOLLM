BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumour among 
adult patients and represents an almost universally fatal disease. Novel 
therapies for GBM are being developed under the orphan drug legislation and the 
knowledge on the molecular makeup of this disease has been increasing rapidly. 
However, the clinical outcomes in GBM patients with currently available 
therapies are still dismal. An insight into the current drug development 
pipeline for GBM is therefore of particular interest.
OBJECTIVES: To provide a quantitative clinical-regulatory insight into the 
status of FDA orphan drug designations for compounds intended to treat GBM.
METHODS: Quantitative cross-sectional analysis of the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration Orphan Drug Product database between 1983 and 2020. STROBE 
criteria were respected.
RESULTS: Four orphan drugs out of 161 (2,4%) orphan drug designations were 
approved for the treatment for GBM by the FDA between 1983 and 2020. Fourteen 
orphan drug designations were subsequently withdrawn for unknown reasons. The 
number of orphan drug designations per year shows a growing trend. In the last 
decade, the therapeutic mechanism of action of designated compounds intended to 
treat glioblastoma shifted from cytotoxic drugs (median year of designation 
2008) to immunotherapeutic approaches and small molecules (median year of 
designation 2014 and 2015 respectively) suggesting an increased focus on 
precision in the therapeutic mechanism of action for compounds the development 
pipeline.
CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that current pharmacological treatment options in 
GBM are sparse, the drug development pipeline is steadily growing. In 
particular, the surge of designated immunotherapies detected in the last years 
raises the hope that elaborate combination possibilities between classical 
therapeutic backbones (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and novel, currently 
experimental therapeutics may help to provide better therapies for this deadly 
disease in the future.
