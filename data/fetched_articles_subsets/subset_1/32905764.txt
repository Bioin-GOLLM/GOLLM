Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and directed 
differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) make it possible to 
model genetic heart disease in vitro. We apply CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing 
technology to introduce three RBM20 mutations in iPSCs and differentiate them 
into iPSC-CMs to establish an in vitro model of RBM20 mutant dilated 
cardiomyopathy (DCM). In iPSC-CMs harboring a known causal RBM20 variant, the 
splicing of RBM20 target genes, calcium handling, and contractility are impaired 
consistent with the disease manifestation in patients. A variant (Pro633Leu) 
identified by exome sequencing of patient genomes displays the same disease 
phenotypes, thus establishing this variant as disease causing. We find that 
all-trans retinoic acid upregulates RBM20 expression and reverts the splicing, 
calcium handling, and contractility defects in iPSC-CMs with different causal 
RBM20 mutations. These results suggest that pharmacological upregulation of 
RBM20 expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for DCM patients with a 
heterozygous mutation in RBM20.
