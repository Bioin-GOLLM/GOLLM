PURPOSE: An amino acid changing polymorphism in the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT) 2B15 gene has been described at codon 85 (aspartate>tyrosine). The UGT2B15 
allele exhibits 2-fold decreased activity for dihydrotestosterone, which was 
suggested to be associated with the risk of prostate cancer based on in vitro 
functional analysis. We determined whether this polymorphism can be used to 
predict individual susceptibility to prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: UGT2B15 expression was determined by reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction of normal prostate tissues. Prevalence 
of the UGT2B15 Asp85Tyr polymorphism was compared between cases and controls by 
allele specific polymerase chain reaction analysis using genomic DNA isolated 
from 155 incident white patients with primary prostate cancer and 155 
individually age matched (+/-5 years) white controls.
RESULTS: UGT2B15 mRNA was detected in all prostate tissues tested. A significant 
association was found between UGT2B15 genotypes and prostate cancer risk. A 
significantly increased risk of prostate cancer was observed in subjects with 
the homozygous UGT2B15 genotype (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.6).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the UGT2B15 enzyme may have a role in 
the metabolism of dihydrotestosterone in prostate tissue and UGT2B15 Asp85Tyr 
polymorphism is associated with prostate cancer risk.
