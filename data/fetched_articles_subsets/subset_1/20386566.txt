We report the first genome-wide association study in 1000 bipolar I patients and 
1000 controls, with a replication of the top hits in another 409 cases and 1000 
controls in the Han Chinese population. Four regions with most strongly 
associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, of which three 
were not found in previous GWA studies in the Caucasian populations. Among them, 
SNPs close to specificity protein 8 (SP8) and ST8 α-N-acetyl- neuraminide 
α-2,8-sialyltransferase (ST8SIA2) are associated with Bipolar I, with P-values 
of 4.87 × 10(-7) (rs2709736) and 6.05 × 10(-6) (rs8040009), respectively. We 
have also identified SNPs in potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 
12 gene (KCTD12) (rs2073831, P=9.74 × 10(-6)) and in CACNB2 (Calcium channel, 
voltage-dependent, β-2 subunit) gene (rs11013860, P=5.15 × 10(-5)), One SNP 
nearby the rs1938526 SNP of ANK3 gene and another SNP nearby the SNP rs11720452 
in chromosome 3 reported in previous GWA studies also showed suggestive 
association in this study (P=6.55 × 10(-5) and P=1.48 × 10(-5), respectively). 
This may suggest that there are common and population-specific susceptibility 
genes for bipolar I disorder.
