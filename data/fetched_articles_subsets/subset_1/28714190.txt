Cytochrome P450 (CYP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and N-acetyltransferase 
(NAT) are crucial for metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics. This study 
investigated whether CYP, GST, and NAT single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with Lynch syndrome. The 
interaction between these SNPs and cigarette smoking or meat consumption was 
also explored. We identified 270 patients with Lynch syndrome from the Taiwan 
Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer Consortium. A weighted Cox 
proportional hazard model was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence interval (CIs). The GSTA1 rs3957356 TT (HR = 5.36, 95% 
CI = 2.39-12.0) and CYP1B1 rs1056836 CC (HR = 7.24, 95% CI = 3.51-14.9) were 
significantly associated with CRC risk when compared to wild-type CC and GG 
genotypes, respectively. However, the CYP1A1 rs4646903 CC genotype significantly 
reduced the risk of CRC (HR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12-0.89) when compared to TT 
genotype. Moreover, significant interactions were observed between NAT1 
acetylation and CYP1B1 rs1056827 and meat consumption.Our results suggest that 
xenobiotic-metabolizing SNPs are not only associated with CRC risk in patients 
with Lynch syndrome in Taiwan but also interact with meat consumption to modify 
the disease risk. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 59:69-78, 2018. © 2017 Wiley
