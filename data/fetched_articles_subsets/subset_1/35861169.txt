SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1), the plant ortholog of mammalian 
AMP-activated protein kinase/fungal (yeast) Sucrose Non-Fermenting 1 
(AMPK/SNF1), plays a central role in metabolic responses to reduced energy 
levels in response to nutritional and environmental stresses. SnRK1 functions as 
a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic α- and regulatory β- and 
βγ-subunits. SnRK1 is a multitasking protein involved in regulating various 
cellular functions, including growth, autophagy, stress response, stomatal 
development, pollen maturation, hormone signaling, and gene expression. However, 
little is known about the mechanism whereby SnRK1 ensures differential execution 
of downstream functions. Compartmentalization has been recently proposed as a 
new key mechanism for regulating SnRK1 signaling in response to stimuli. In this 
review, we discuss the multitasking role of SnRK1 signaling associated with 
different subcellular compartments.
