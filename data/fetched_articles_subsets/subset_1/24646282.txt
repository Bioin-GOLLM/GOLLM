AD (Alzheimer's disease) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the aged 
population. Definitive diagnosis of AD is based on the presence of senile 
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are identified in post-mortem brain 
specimens. A third pathological component is inflammation. AD results from 
multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. Among other factors, 
epidemiological studies report beneficial effects of caffeine, a non-selective 
antagonist of adenosine receptors. In the present review, we discuss the impact 
of caffeine and the adenosinergic system in AD pathology as well as consequences 
in terms of pathology and therapeutics.
