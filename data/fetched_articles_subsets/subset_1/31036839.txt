Nuclear export signal (NES) motifs function as essential regulators of the 
subcellular location of proteins by interacting with the major nuclear exporter 
protein, CRM1. Prediction of NES is of great interest in many aspects of 
research including cancer, but currently available methods, which are mostly 
based on the sequence-based approaches, have been suffered from high false 
positive rates since the NES consensus patterns are quite commonly observed in 
protein sequences. Therefore, finding a feature that can distinguish real NES 
motifs from false positives is desired to improve the prediction power, but it 
is quite challenging when only using the sequence. Here, we provide a 
comprehensive table for the validated cargo proteins, containing the location of 
the NES consensus patterns with the disordered propensity plots, known protein 
domain information, and the predicted secondary structures. It could be useful 
for determining the most plausible NES region in the context of the whole 
protein sequence and suggests possibilities for some non-binders of the 
annotated regions. In addition, using the currently available crystal structures 
of CRM1 bound to various classes of NES peptides, we adopted, for the first 
time, the structure-based prediction of the NES motifs bound to the CRM1's 
binding groove. Combining sequence-based and structure-based predictions, we 
suggest a novel and more straight-forward approach to identify CRM1-binding NES 
sequences by analysis of their structural prerequisites and energetic evaluation 
of the stability at the CRM1's binding site.
