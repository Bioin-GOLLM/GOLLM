OBJECTIVES: Despite initial responses to epidermal growth factor receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in EGFR mutant non-small cell lung 
cancer, patients invariably develop acquired resistance. In this study, we 
performed next-generation sequencing in pre- and post-EGFR-TKI tumor samples to 
identify novel resistance mechanisms to EGFR-TKIs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected tumor tissues before EGFR-TKI treatment and 
after progression from 19 NSCLC patients to analyze genomic alterations in 409 
cancer related genes. Bioinformatics analyses were used to identify mutations in 
which the allele frequencies are significantly changed, or newly appeared after 
progression.
RESULTS: Overall, mutation rates and compositions were similar between pre- and 
post-EGFR-TKI tumors. We identified EGFR T790M as the most common mechanism of 
acquired resistance (63.2%). No pre-EGFR-TKI tumor had a preexisting T790M 
mutation, suggesting that tumors acquired T790M mutations following progression 
on EGFR-TKIs. Compared to T790M-positive tumors, T790M-negative tumors showed 
relatively high tumor mutation burden and shorter survival, suggesting 
T790M-negative patients as a potential candidate for immune checkpoint 
inhibitors. TP53 mutation was also significantly enriched in the T790M-negative 
tumors. Finally, we described here for the first time a novel missense mutation 
(T263P), which occurred concurrently with an activating G719A mutation, in the 
extracellular domain II of EGFR in a patient with poor response to erlotinib. 
Ba/F3 cells harboring EGFR T263P/G719A mutation showed higher sensitivity to 
afatinib, compared to gefitinib due to inhibition of EGFR/HER2 
heterodimerization.
CONCLUSION: Comprehensive genomic analysis of post-EGFR-TKI tumors can provide 
novel insight into the complex molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to 
EGFR-TKIs.
