BACKGROUND: A CYP3A5 gene polymorphism is the main determinant of Tacrolimus 
(Tac) dose requirements among renal transplanted patients. In spite of the 
utility of CYP3A5 genotyping to predict the Tac-dose, many patients exhibit an 
out of range blood Tac level and it is thus likely that other 
genes/polymorphisms contribute to define Tac bioavailability. To address this 
issue we searched for coding sequence variants in the ABCB1/MDR1 gene in renal 
transplanted patients treated with Tac and who had out of the range blood 
levels.
METHODS: We studied 100 renal transplanted patients treated with Tac, 60 of whom 
had Tac blood levels below (n=39) and above (n=21) the target range (10-15 
ng/mL) at 1 week post-transplant. The DNA was subjected to multiplex 
amplification followed by massive parallel semiconductor sequencing in the Ion 
Torrent personal genome machine.
RESULTS: We found four missense changes, all reported and present in cases above 
and below the blood Tac target. In addition, we did not find differences in the 
allele and genotype frequencies for the common rs1045642 polymorphism (p.I1145I) 
between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that the ABCB1 variants had no effect on the 
risk of showing out of range Tac blood levels among renal transplanted patients.
