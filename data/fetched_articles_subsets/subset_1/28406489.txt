Disclaimer:This diagnostic guideline is intended as an educational resource and 
represents the opinions of the authors, and is not representative of 
recommendations or policy of the American College of Medical Genetics and 
Genomics (ACMG). The information should be considered a consensus based on 
expert opinion, as more comprehensive levels of evidence were not available in 
the literature in all cases.
BACKGROUND: Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a rare, progressive, and 
often fatal lysosomal storage disease. The underlying metabolic defect is 
deficiency of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase that results in progressive 
accumulation of sphingomyelin in target tissues. ASMD manifests as a spectrum of 
severity ranging from rapidly progressive severe neurovisceral disease that is 
uniformly fatal to more slowly progressive chronic neurovisceral and chronic 
visceral forms. Disease management is aimed at symptom control and regular 
assessments for multisystem involvement.
PURPOSE AND METHODS: An international panel of experts in the clinical and 
laboratory evaluation, diagnosis, treatment/management, and genetic aspects of 
ASMD convened to review the evidence base and share personal experience in order 
to develop a guideline for diagnosis of the various ASMD phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Although care of ASMD patients is typically provided by metabolic 
disease specialists, the guideline is directed at a wide range of providers 
because it is important for primary care providers (e.g., pediatricians and 
internists) and specialists (e.g., pulmonologists, hepatologists, and 
hematologists) to be able to identify ASMD.Genet Med advance online publication
