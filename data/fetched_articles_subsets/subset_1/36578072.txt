BACKGROUND: Sterile alpha motif domain and histidine-aspartate domain-containing 
protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a DNA end resection factor, which is involved in DNA 
damage repair and innate immunity. However, the role of SAMHD1 in anti-tumor 
immunity is still unknown. This study investigated the effects of SAMHD1 on 
stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-type I interferon (IFN) pathway and 
radiation-induced immune responses.
METHODS: The roles of SAMHD1 in the activation of cytosolic DNA sensing STING 
pathway in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells were investigated with flow 
cytometry, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting and qPCR. The combined effects of 
SAMHD1 silencing and radiation on tumor cell growth and STING pathway activation 
were also evaluated with colony formation and CCK8 assay. The Lewis lung cancer 
mouse model was used to evaluate the combined efficiency of SAMHD1 silencing and 
radiotherapy in vivo. Macrophage M1 polarization and cytotoxic T cell 
infiltration were evaluated with flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulated in the cytosol of 
SAMHD1-deficient lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, accompanied by upregulated 
DNA sensor IFN-γ-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and activated STING pathway. The 
translocation of IFI16 from nucleus to cytosol was detected in SAMHD1-deficient 
cells. IFI16 and STING were acquired in the activation of STING-IFN-I pathway in 
SAMHD1-deficient cells. SAMHD1 silencing in LUAD cells promoted macrophage M1 
polarization in vitro. SAMHD1 silencing synergized with radiation to activate 
ssDNA-STING-IFN-I pathway, inhibit proliferation, promote apoptosis and regulate 
cell cycle. SAMHD1 silencing cooperated with radiotherapy to inhibit tumor 
growth and increase CD86+MHC-IIhigh M1 proportion and CD8+ T cell infiltration 
in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: SAMHD1 deficiency induced IFN-I production through cytosolic 
IFI16-STING pathway in LUAD cells. Moreover, SAMHD1 downregulation and radiation 
cooperated to inhibit tumor growth and enhance anti-tumor immune responses 
through macrophage M1 polarization and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Combination of 
SAMHD1 inhibition and radiotherapy may be a potentially therapeutic strategy for 
LUAD patients.
