Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are known to have complex, genetically 
influenced etiologies, involving dysfunctional interactions between the 
intestinal immune system and the microbiome. Here, we characterized how the RNA 
transcript from an IBD-associated long non-coding RNA locus ("CARINH-Colitis 
Associated IRF1 antisense Regulator of Intestinal Homeostasis") protects against 
IBD. We show that CARINH and its neighboring gene coding for the transcription 
factor IRF1 together form a feedforward loop in host myeloid cells. The loop 
activation is sustained by microbial factors, and functions to maintain the 
intestinal host-commensal homeostasis via the induction of the anti-inflammatory 
factor IL-18BP and anti-microbial factors called guanylate-binding proteins 
(GBPs). Extending these mechanistic insights back to humans, we demonstrate that 
the function of the CARINH/IRF1 loop is conserved between mice and humans. 
Genetically, the T allele of rs2188962, the most probable causal variant of IBD 
within the CARINH locus from the human genetics study, impairs the inducible 
expression of the CARINH/IRF1 loop and thus increases genetic predisposition to 
IBD. Our study thus illustrates how an IBD-associated lncRNA maintains 
intestinal homeostasis and protects the host against colitis.
