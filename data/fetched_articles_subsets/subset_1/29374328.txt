OBJECTIVE: Orofacial development is a complex process subjected to failure 
impairing. Indeed, the cleft of the lip and/or of the palate is among the most 
frequent inborn malformations. The JARID2 gene has been suggested to be involved 
in non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P) etiology. 
JARID2 interacts with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in regulating the 
expression patterns of developmental genes by modifying the chromatin state.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genes coding for the PRC2 components, as well as other 
genes active in cell differentiation and embryonic development, were selected 
for a family-based association study to verify their involvement in nsCL/P. A 
total of 632 families from Italy and Asia participated to the study.
RESULTS: Evidence of allelic association was found with polymorphisms of SNAI1; 
in particular, the rs16995010-G allele was undertransmitted to the nsCL/P cases 
[P = 0.004, odds ratio = 0.69 (95% C.I. 0.54-0.89)]. However, the adjusted 
significance value corrected for all the performed tests was P = 0.051.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings emerging by the present study suggest for the first 
time an involvement of SNAI1 in the nsCL/P onset.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Interestingly, SNAI1 is known to promote epithelial to 
mesenchymal transition by repressing E-cadherin expression, but it needs an 
intact PRC2 to act this function. Alterations of this process could contribute 
to the complex etiology of nsCL/P.
