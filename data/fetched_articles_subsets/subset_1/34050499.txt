Currently, there is no large animal model of sustained limb ischemia suitable 
for testing novel angiogenic therapeutics for peripheral artery disease (PAD) 
such as drugs, genes, materials, or cells. We created a large animal model 
suitable for efficacy assessment of these therapies by testing 3 swine hind limb 
ischemia (HLI) variations and quantifying vascular perfusion, muscle histology, 
and limb function. Ligation of the ipsilateral external and bilateral internal 
iliac arteries produced sustained gait dysfunction compared to isolated external 
iliac or unilateral external and internal iliac artery ligations. 
Hyperemia-dependent muscle perfusion deficits, depressed limb blood pressure, 
arteriogenesis, muscle atrophy, and microscopic myopathy were quantifiable in 
ischemic limbs 6 weeks post-ligation. Porcine mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) 
engineered to express a reporter gene were visualized post-administration via 
positron emission tomography (PET) in vivo. These results establish a 
preclinical platform enabling better optimization of PAD therapies, including 
cellular therapeutics, increasing bench-to-bedside translational success. A 
preclinical platform for porcine studies of peripheral artery disease therapies 
including (1) a hind limb ischemia model and (2) non-invasive MSC viability and 
retention assessment via PET.
