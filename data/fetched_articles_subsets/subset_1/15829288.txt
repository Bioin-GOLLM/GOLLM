Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a C-type lectin produced by the liver and 
involved in the innate immune response. We have analyzed six SNPs of MBL2 
gene--three at promoter (-550, -435, and -221), one at 5'-untranslational region 
(UTR) (+4), and two at coding (Gly54Asp and Leu126Leu) regions--in the Korean 
population (N=129), and have correlated genotypes with the serum concentration 
and functional characteristics. Of those, the Asp54 allele (P<10(-15)), L allele 
at -550 (P<10(-7)), and P allele at +4 (P=0.012) were correlated with low MBL 
levels. The effect of the X allele at -221 on MBL levels in the Korean 
population appeared to be less profound than that of other populations. The 
highest MBL producing promoter haplotype in the Korean population was HYP, 
followed by LYQ and LYP, and then LXP. From functional analysis of MBL, low MBL 
levels were correlated with low mannan-binding, low C4 complement activation, 
and lack of high ordered oligomers. Our results support that the promoter and 
coding polymorphisms of MBL are correlated with its functional activity as well 
as circulating levels, and the association patterns are quite similar to those 
of other populations.
