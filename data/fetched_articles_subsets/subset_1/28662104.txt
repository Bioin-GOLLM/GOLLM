A novel strain Vibrio aphrogenes sp. nov. strain CA-1004T isolated from the 
surface of seaweed collected on the coast of Mie Prefecture in 1994 [1] was 
characterized using polyphasic taxonomy including multilocus sequence analysis 
(MLSA) and a genome based comparison. Both phylogenetic analyses on the basis of 
16S rRNA gene sequences and MLSA based on eight protein-coding genes (gapA, 
gyrB, ftsZ, mreB, pyrH, recA, rpoA, and topA) showed the strain could be placed 
in the Rumoiensis clade in the genus Vibrio. Sequence similarities of the 16S 
rRNA gene and the multilocus genes against the Rumoiensis clade members, V. 
rumoiensis, V. algivorus, V. casei, and V. litoralis, were low enough to propose 
V. aphrogenes sp. nov. strain CA-1004T as a separate species. The experimental 
DNA-DNA hybridization data also revealed that the strain CA-1004T was separate 
from four known Rumoiensis clade species. The G+C content of the V. aphrogenes 
strain was determined as 42.1% based on the genome sequence. Major traits of the 
strain were non-motile, halophilic, fermentative, alginolytic, and gas 
production. A total of 27 traits (motility, growth temperature range, amylase, 
alginase and lipase productions, and assimilation of 19 carbon compounds) 
distinguished the strain from the other species in the Rumoiensis clade. The 
name V. aphrogenes sp. nov. is proposed for this species in the Rumoiensis 
clade, with CA-1004T as the type strain (JCM 31643T = DSM 103759T).
