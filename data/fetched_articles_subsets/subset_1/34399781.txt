BACKGROUND: The roles of FTO gene and the level of serum 25-OH-vitamin D in 
obesity are frequently reported. This study aimed to investigate the 
interactions of serum 25-OH-vitamin D level, FTO and IRX3 genes expression, and 
FTO genotype in obese and overweight boys.
METHODS: This study was carried out on the 120 male adolescents with overweight 
in Tehran, Iran. Blood samples were collected from the participants in order to 
evaluate the serum level of 25-OH-vitamin D, the expression level of FTO and 
IRX3 genes, and FTO genotype for rs9930506 at baseline and after 18 weeks of the 
study.
RESULTS: In general, no significant association was found between serum 
25-OH-vitamin D level and IRX3 and FTO genes expression. The results of linear 
regression on the relationship between 25-OH-vitamin D serum level and FTO and 
IRX3 genes expression based on FTO genotypes for rs9930506 indicated that in 
AA/AG genotype carriers, serum 25-OH-vitamin D level was positively associated 
with FTO gene expression (B = 0.07, p = 0.02) and inversely associated with IRX3 
gene expression (B = - 0.07, p = 0.03). In GG carriers, serum 25-OH-vitamin D 
level was not associated with expression of IRX3 and FTO genes.
CONCLUSION: There are significant interactions between 25-OH-vitamin D and the 
expression of FTO and IRX3 genes in the subset of obese patients with specific 
genotypes for FTO rs9930506. There was no association between serum 
25-OH-vitamin D levels and the expression of FTO and IRX genes in individuals 
with a homozygous genotype for the risk allele of the FTO gene polymorphism.
