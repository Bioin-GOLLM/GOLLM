Epigenome-wide studies report higher methylation among women than men with 
decreasing levels with age. Little is known about associations of sex and age 
with methylation of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). Methylation of the first exonic 
and partial first intronic region of MAOA has been shown to strengthen 
associations of interactions of MAOA-uVNTR genotypes and adversity with 
aggression and substance misuse. Our study examined associations of sex and age 
with MAOA first exon and intron methylation levels in 252 women and 157 men aged 
14-73 years. Participants included adolescents recruited at a substance misuse 
clinic, their siblings and parents, and healthy women. Women showed ~ 50% higher 
levels of exonic, and ~ 15% higher intronic, methylation than men. Methylation 
levels were similar between younger (M = 22.7 years) and older (M = 46.1 years) 
participants, and stable across age. Age modified few associations of 
methylation levels with sex. MAOA genotypes modified few associations of 
methylation with sex and age. Higher methylation levels among women were not 
explained by genotype, nor interaction of genotype and sexual abuse. Findings 
were similar after adjusting for lifetime diagnoses of substance dependence 
(women = 24.3%; men = 34.2%). Methylation levels were higher among women who 
experienced sexual abuse than women who did not. Results extend on prior studies 
by showing that women display higher levels of methylation than men within first 
intronic/exonic regions of MAOA, which did not decrease with age in either sex. 
Findings were not conditioned by genotype nor interactions of genotype and 
trauma, and indicate X-chromosome inactivation.
