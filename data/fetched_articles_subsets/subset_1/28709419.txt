BACKGROUND: In 2015, the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outside the Middle East occurred in South 
Korea. We summarized the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings of 
the first Korean case of MERS-CoV and analyzed whole-genome sequences of 
MERS-CoV derived from the patient.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man developed fever and myalgia 7 days after 
returning to Korea, following a 10-day trip to the Middle East. Before 
diagnosis, he visited 4 hospitals, potentially resulting in secondary 
transmission to 28 patients. On admission to the National Medical Center (day 9, 
post-onset of clinical illness), he presented with drowsiness, hypoxia, and 
multiple patchy infiltrations on the chest radiograph. He was intubated (day 12) 
because of progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and INF-α2a 
and ribavirin treatment was commenced. The treatment course was prolonged by 
superimposed ventilator associated pneumonia. MERS-CoV PCR results converted to 
negative from day 47 and the patient was discharged (day 137), following 
rehabilitation therapy. The complete genome sequence obtained from a sputum 
sample (taken on day 11) showed the highest sequence similarity (99.59%) with 
the virus from an outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in February 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: The first case of MERS-CoV infection had high transmissibility and 
was associated with a severe clinical course. The patient made a successful 
recovery after early treatment with antiviral agents and adequate supportive 
care. This first case in South Korea became a super-spreader because of improper 
infection control measures, rather than variations of the virus.
