We acquired serial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of a Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease (CJD) patient carrying the V180I mutation; his symptoms slowly 
progressed over a period of 10 years. A 57-year-old man presented with cognitive 
impairment and was admitted to our hospital. Diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) 
and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed high-intensity 
areas (HIAs) in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia, but not in the thalamus, 
brainstem, and cerebellum, until 1.5 years after symptom onset. The HIAs in the 
cerebral cortex and basal ganglia disappeared 4 years after symptom onset, while 
the atrophy in these regions progressed rapidly during this period. However, the 
thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum appeared to be preserved over 10 years after 
symptom onset. The mechanism for the regional vulnerability in brains of CJD 
patients remains unclear. Further studies in additional cases are required to 
clarify whether differences in the mutation of the prion protein gene might be 
associated with the vulnerability.
