QseC is a histidine kinase (HK) receptor involved in quorum sensing, a mechanism 
by which bacteria respond to fluctuations in cell population. We conducted a 
structural study of the cytoplasmic domain of QseC (QseC-CD) using X-ray 
crystallography. The 2.5 Ã… structure of the apo-enzyme revealed that the kinase 
domain of QseC retains the overall fold of the typical HK kinase domain. The 
construct that we used is inactive in the autokinase reaction and its inactivity 
is most likely caused by its atypical dimerization interface, as compared to 
that observed in the T.maritima HK cytoplasmic domain structure. Restoration of 
the activity may require that the entire dimerization domain be present in the 
protein construct. QseC, which plays an important role in bacterial 
pathogenesis, is a promising drug target and the structure of QseC-CD provides a 
platform for developing more potent inhibitors of pathogen virulence.
