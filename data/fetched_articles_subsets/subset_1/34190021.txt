Infertility is a common health problem that affects around 1 in 6 couples in the 
United States, where half of these cases are attributed to male factors. 
Genetics play an important role in infertility and it is estimated that up to 
50% of cases are due to genetic factors. Despite this, many male infertility 
cases are still idiopathic. This study aimed to identify the presence of 
possibly pathogenic rare variants in a set of candidate genes related to 
azoospermia in 69 Jordanian men using a next-generation sequencing-based panel 
covering more than a hundred male infertility related genes. A total of 9 
variants were found and validated. Among them, two variants included reported 
pathogenic variants in CFTR and one novel pathogenic variant in the USP9Y gene. 
We also report the detection of 6 other variants with uncertain significance in 
other genes. Interestingly, male cases with CFTR variants did not show the 
expected cystic fibrosis phenotypes except for infertility. This work helps to 
uncover the contribution of additional genetic factors to the aetiology of male 
infertility and highlights the importance to obtain more reliable information 
about the presence of genetic variation in the Jordanian population.
