Germline mutations of TP53 are responsible for Li-Fraumeni syndrome in its 
60-80%. We found a novel germline mutation, TP53: c.997del:p.R333Vfs*12 
(NM_000546.6, GRCh, 17:7670713..7670713). The proband is a 40-year-old female, 
who was suffered from osteosarcoma in her right forearm at her age of 11. She 
was also suffered from lung adenocarcinoma in her right upper lobe and bone 
metastasis in her right scapula at her age of 37. She was treated with 
gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(EGFR-TKI) because of EGFR mutation (L747-S752 del). Her bone metastasis became 
resistant after 1-year treatment. Bone metastasis had an additional EGFR 
mutation (T790M). The secondary treatment with osimertinib, an another EGFR-TKI, 
can successfully control the tumors for over 2 years. This TP53 mutation 
(R333Vfs*12) was first found in lung adenocarcinomas. The therapeutic effect of 
osimertinib for this triple mutant lung adenocarcinoma is better than the 
previous report.
