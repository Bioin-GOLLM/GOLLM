The novel carbocyclic nucleoside, abacavir, is metabolized in cells to carbovir 
triphosphate which is a potent inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase (K(i) 
0.021 microM with calf thymus DNA template primer). Abacavir exhibits potent in 
vitro antiviral activity against wild-type HIV-1 (IC(50) 4.0 microM, MT-4 cells) 
but this activity is lower than the activity of AZT (IC(50) 0.040 microM, MT-4 
cells). However, there is no significant difference between the levels of 
activity of abacavir (IC(50) 0.26 microM) and AZT (IC(50) 0.23 microM) against 
clinical isolates of HIV-1. The in vitro toxicity data (CC(50)) of abacavir 
were: 160 microM (CEM cells); 140 microM (CD4+ CEM cells) and 110 microM (normal 
bone progenitor cells, BFU-E). Abacavir has been approved in the United States 
for the treatment of pediatric and adult HIV infection and current 
recommendations consist of combination therapy in children with HIV infection. 
Resistance to abacavir develops relatively slowly, with most of the mutations 
conferring minimal resistance. The M184V mutation appears to be the cornerstone 
of higher level resistance in regimens containing abacavir, imparting a 2-4 fold 
reduction in the susceptibility of HIV to abacavir.
