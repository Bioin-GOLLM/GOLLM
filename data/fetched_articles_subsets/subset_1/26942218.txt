Aberrant intramuscular triacylglycerol (TAG) storage in human skeletal muscle is 
closely related to insulin insensitivity. Excessive lipid storage can induce 
insulin resistance of skeletal muscle, and under severe conditions, lead to type 
2 diabetes. The balance of interconversion between diacylglycerol and TAG 
greatly influences lipid storage and utilization. Diacylglycerol 
O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) plays a key role in this process, but its activation 
and phosphorylation requires further dissection. In this study, 12 putative 
conserved phosphorylation sites of DGAT1 were identified by examining amino acid 
conservation of DGAT1 in different species. Another 12 putative phosphorylation 
sites were also found based on bioinformatics predictions and previous reports. 
Meanwhile, several phosphorylation sites of DGAT1 were verified by 
phosphorylation mass spectrometry analysis of purified DGAT1 from mouse myoblast 
C2C12 cells. Using single point mutations, a regulatory role of 3 putative 
phosphorylation sites was dissected. Finally, using truncation mutations, a 
potential domainÂ of DGAT1 that was involved in the regulation of enzymatic 
activity was revealed. This study provides useful information for further 
understanding DGAT1 activity regulation.
