INTRODUCTION: Even though ocular refractive state is highly heritable and under 
strong genetic control, the identification of susceptibility genes remains a 
challenge. Several HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) gene variants have been 
associated with ocular refractive errors and corneal pathology.
PURPOSE: Here, we assess the association of an HGF gene variant, previously 
reported as associated with hyperopia, and ocular biometric parameters in a 
multicenter Spanish cohort.
METHODS: An observational prospective multicenter cross-sectional study was 
designed, including a total of 403 unrelated subjects comprising 188 hyperopic 
children (5 to 17 years) and 2 control groups: 52 emmetropic adolescents (13 to 
17 years) and 163 emmetropic young adults (18 to 28 years). Each individual 
underwent a comprehensive eye examination including cycloplegic refraction, and 
topographic and ocular biometric analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from oral 
swabs. HGF single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12536657 was genotyped. 
Genotypic, allelic, and logistic regression analyses were performed comparing 
the different groups. A quantitative trait association test analyzing several 
biometric parameters was also performed using generalized estimating equations 
(GEEs) adjusting for age and gender.
RESULTS: No association between rs12536657 and hyperopia was found through 
gender-adjusted logistic regression comparing the hyperopic children with either 
of the two control groups. Significant associations between mean topographic 
corneal curvature and rs12536657 for G/A (slope = +0.32; CI 95%: 0.04-0.60; 
p=0.023) and A/A (slope = +0.76; CI 95%: 0.12-1.40; p=0.020) genotypes were 
observed with the age- and gender-adjusted univariate GEE model. Both flat and 
steep corneal topographic meridians were also significantly associated with 
rs12536657 for the G/A and A/A genotypes. No association was found between 
rs12536657 and any other topographic or biometric measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a possible role for HGF gene variant rs12536657 
in corneal curvature in our population. To our knowledge, this is the first 
multicenter quantitative trait association study of HGF genotypes and ocular 
biometric parameters comprising a pediatric cohort.
