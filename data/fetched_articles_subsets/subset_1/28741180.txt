INTRODUCTION: Non-homologous end joining gene 1 (NHEJ1) defect is a rare form of 
primary immune deficiency. Very few cases have been described from around the 
world.
PURPOSE: We are reporting the first family from the Arabian Gulf with three 
siblings presenting with combined immunodeficiency (CID), microcephaly, and 
growth retardation due to a novel NHEJ1 splice site mutation, in addition to a 
review of the previously published literature on this subject.
METHODS: Patients' clinical, immunological, and laboratory features were 
examined. Samples were subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). 
The pathogenic change in NHEJ1 was confirmed by Sanger sequencing, then further 
assessed at the RNA and protein levels.
RESULTS: Patients were found to have a homozygous splice site mutation 
immediately downstream of exon 3 in NHEJ1 (c.390 + 1G > C). This led to two 
distinct mRNA products, one of which demonstrated skipping of the last 69 
basepairs (bp) of exon 3 while the other showed complete skipping of the entire 
exon. Although both deletions were in-frame, immunoblotting did not reveal any 
NHEJ1 protein products in patient cells, indicating a null phenotype.
CONCLUSION: Patients presenting with CID, microcephaly, and growth retardation 
should be screened for NHEJ1 gene mutations. We discuss our data in the context 
of one of our patients who is still alive at the age of 30 years, without 
transplantation, and who is the longest known survivor of this disease.
