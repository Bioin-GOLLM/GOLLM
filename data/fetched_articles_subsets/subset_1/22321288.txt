The antifolate sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been used in the intermittent 
prevention of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp). SP is an ideal choice for IPTp, 
however, as resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to SP increases, data are 
accumulating that SP may no longer provide benefit in areas of high-level 
resistance. Probenecid was initially used as an adjunctive therapy to increase 
the blood concentration of penicillin; it has since been used to augment 
concentrations of other drugs, including antifolates. The addition of probenecid 
has been shown to increase the treatment efficacy of SP against malaria, 
suggesting that the combination of probenecid plus SP may prolong the useful 
lifespan of SP as an effective agent for IPTp. Here, the literature on the 
pharmacokinetics, adverse reactions, interactions and available data on the use 
of these drugs in pregnancy is reviewed, and the possible utility of an 
SP-probenecid combination is discussed. This article concludes by calling for 
further research into this potentially useful combination.
