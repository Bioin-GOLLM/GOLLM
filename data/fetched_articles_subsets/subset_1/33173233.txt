Observations of IRC +10216 with the Yebes 40m telescope between 31 and 50 GHz 
have revealed more than 150 unidentified lines. Some of them can be grouped into 
a new series of 26 doublets, harmonically related with integer quantum numbers 
ranging from J up=54 to 80. The separation of the doublets increases 
systematically with J, i.e., as expected for a linear species in one of its 
bending modes. The rotational parameters resulting from the fit to these data 
are B = 290.8844 ± 0.0004 MHz, D = 0.88 ± 0.04 Hz, q = 0.1463 ± 0.0001 MHz. The 
rotational constant is very close to that of the ground state of HC9N. Ab initio 
calculations show an excellent agreement between these parameters and those 
predicted for the lowest energy vibrationally excited state, ν 19=1, of HC9N. 
This is the first detection, and complete characterization in space, of 
vibrationally excited HC9N. An energy of 41.5 cm-1 is estimated for the ν 19 
state. In addition, 17 doublets of HC7N in the ν 15=1 state, for which 
laboratory spectroscopy is available, have been detected for the first time in 
IRC+10216. Several doublets of HC5N in its ν 11=1 state have been also observed. 
The column density ratio between the ground and the lowest excited vibrational 
states are ≈127, 9.5, and 1.5 for HC5N, HC7N, and HC9N, respectively. We find 
that these lowest-lying vibrational states are most probably populated via 
infrared pumping to vibrationally excited states lying at ≈600 cm-1. The lowest 
vibrationally excited states thus need to be taken into account to precisely 
determine absolute abundances and abundanceratios for long carbon chains. The 
abundance ratios N(HC5N)/N(HC7N) and N(HC7N)/N(HC9N) are 2.4 and 7.7 
respectively.
