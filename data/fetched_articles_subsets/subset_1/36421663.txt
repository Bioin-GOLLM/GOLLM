Many eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms employ RNA editing (insertion, 
deletion, or conversion) as a post-transcriptional modification mechanism. RNA 
editing events are common in these organelles of plants and have gained 
particular attention due to their role in the development and growth of plants, 
as well as their ability to cope with abiotic stress. Owing to rapid 
developments in sequencing technologies and data analysis methods, such editing 
sites are being accurately predicted, and many factors that influence RNA 
editing are being discovered. The mechanism and role of the pentatricopeptide 
repeat protein family of proteins in RNA editing are being uncovered with the 
growing realization of accessory proteins that might help these proteins. This 
review will discuss the role and type of RNA editing events in plants with an 
emphasis on chloroplast RNA editing, involved factors, gaps in knowledge, and 
future outlooks.
