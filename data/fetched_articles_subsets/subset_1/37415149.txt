BACKGROUND: Previous studies show that antibiotic-mediated (abx) alteration of 
the gut microbiome (GMB) results in a reduction of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and 
proinflammatory microglial phenotype in male APPPS1-21 mice. However, the effect 
of GMB perturbation on astrocyte phenotypes and microglial-astrocyte 
communication in the context of amyloidosis has not been examined.
METHODS: To study whether the GMB modulates astrocyte phenotype in the context 
of amyloidosis, APPPS1-21 male and female mice were treated with broad-spectrum 
abx leading to GMB perturbation. GFAP + astrocytes, plaque-associated astrocytes 
(PAA), PAA morphological parameters, and astrocyte complement component C3 
levels were quantified using a combination of immunohistochemistry, 
immunoblotting, widefield microscopy, and confocal microscopy. Furthermore, 
these same astrocyte phenotypes were assessed in abx-treated APPPS1-21 male mice 
that received either fecal matter transplant (FMT) from untreated APPPS1-21 male 
donors to restore their microbiome or vehicle control. To assess complete 
absence of the GMB on astrocyte phenotypes, the same astrocyte phenotypes were 
quantified in APPPS1-21 male mice raised in germ-free (GF) or specific-pathogen 
free conditions (SPF). Lastly, we assessed whether microglia are necessary for 
abx-induced astrocyte phenotypes by depleting microglia in APPPS1-21 male mice 
via treatment with a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor 
(PLX5622) and vehicle control or PLX5622 and abx.
RESULTS: Herein, we demonstrate that postnatal treatment of male APPPS1-21 mice 
with broad-spectrum abx leading to GMB perturbation reduces GFAP + reactive 
astrocytes and PAAs, suggesting that the GMB plays a role in regulating reactive 
astrocyte induction and recruitment to Aβ plaques. Additionally, we show that 
compared to controls, PAAs in abx-treated male APPPS1-21 mice exhibit an altered 
morphology with increased number and length of processes and reduced astrocytic 
complement C3, consistent with a homeostatic phenotype. GFAP + astrocyte 
reduction, PAA reduction, astrocyte morphological changes, and C3 levels are 
restored when abx-treated mice are subject to FMT from untreated APPPS1-21 male 
donor mice. Next, we found that APPPS1-21 male mice raised in GF conditions have 
similar astrocyte phenotypes as abx-treated male APPPS1-21 male mice. 
Correlational analysis revealed that pathogenic bacteria depleted by abx 
correlate with GFAP + astrocytosis, PAAs, and astrocyte morphological changes. 
Finally, we determined that abx-mediated reduction in GFAP + astrocytosis, PAAs, 
and astrocytic C3 expression is independent of microglia. However, abx-induced 
astrocyte morphological alterations are dependent on the presence of microglia, 
suggesting that there is both microglial independent and dependent GMB control 
of reactive astrocyte phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time, in the context of amyloidosis, that the 
GMB plays an important role in controlling reactive astrocyte induction, 
morphology, and astrocyte recruitment to Aβ plaques. GMB regulation of these 
astrocytic phenotypes is both independent and dependent on microglia.
