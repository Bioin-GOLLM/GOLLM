Parvovirus B19 (B19V) can cause inflammatory cardiomyopathy and endothelial 
dysfunction. Pathophysiological mechanisms involved include 
lysophosphatidylcholine producing phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity of the B19V 
capsid protein VP1. Most recently, VP1 and lysophosphatidylcholine have been 
shown to inhibit Na(+)/K(+) ATPase. The present study explored whether VP1 
modifies the activity of Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 K(+) channels. cRNA encoding Kv1.3 or 
Kv1.5 was injected into Xenopus oocytes without or with cRNA encoding VP1 
isolated from a patient suffering from fatal B19V-induced myocarditis. K(+) 
channel activity was determined by dual electrode voltage clamp. Injection of 
cRNA encoding Kv1.3 or Kv1.5 into Xenopus oocytes was followed by appearance of 
Kv K(+) channel activity, which was significantly decreased by additional 
injection of cRNA encoding VP1, but not by additional injection of cRNA encoding 
PLA2-negative VP1 mutant (H153A). The effect of VP1 on Kv current was not 
significantly modified by transcription inhibitor actinomycin (10 μM for 36 h) 
but was mimicked by lysophosphatidylcholine (1 μg/ml). The B19V capsid protein 
VP1 inhibits host cell Kv channels, an effect at least partially due to 
phospholipase A2 (PLA) dependent formation of lysophosphatidylcholine.
