The Interleukin-23 signalling pathway is important for the differentiation of 
TH17 lymphocytes and is involved in the pathogenesis of Inflammatory bowel 
disease. Polymorphisms in the IL-23 receptor gene were previously found to be 
associated with Inflammatory bowel disease in various populations. The aim of 
this study was to determine whether the specific rs11209026 and rs7530511 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the Interleukin-23 receptor gene are 
associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in a Croatian patient 
population. A total of 50 patients with Crohn's disease and 93 patients with 
ulcerative colitis, as well as 99 healthy control subjects were included in the 
study. The results determined a significantly higher occurrence of rs11209026 in 
control group compared to patients with inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting a 
protective effect of this polymorphism. The rs11209026 variant was strongly 
associated with Crohn's disease, but it was absent in ulcerative colitis. 
However, there was no significant association between the rs7530511 polymorphism 
with either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Associations presented in 
this study give potentially important insight into the roles of specific 
Interleukin-23 receptor polymorphisms in Crohn's disease pathogenesis in the 
Croatian population.
