Dehong humped cattle are precious livestock resources of Yunnan Province, China; 
they have typical zebu traits. Here, we investigated their genetic 
characteristics using whole-genome resequencing data of Dehong humped animals (n 
= 18). When comparing our data with the publicly-available data, we found that 
Dehong humped cattle have high nucleotide diversity. Based on clustering models 
in a population structure analysis, Dehong humped cattle had a mutual genome 
ancestor with Chinese and Indian indicine cattle. While using the RFMix method, 
it is speculated that the body sizes of Dehong humped cattle were influenced by 
the Chinese indicine segments and that the immune systems of Dehong humped 
cattle were affected by additional ancestral segments (Indian indicine). 
Furthermore, we explored the position selection regions harboring genes in the 
Dehong humped cattle, which were related to heat tolerance (FILIP1L, ABHD6) and 
immune responses (GZMM, PRKCZ, STOML2, LRBA, PIK3CD). Notably, missense 
mutations were detected in the candidate gene ABHD6 (c.870C>A p.Asp290Glu; 
c.987C>A p.Ser329Arg). The missense mutations may have implications for Dehong 
humped cattle adaptation to hot environments. This study provides valuable 
genomic resource data at the genome-wide level and paves the way for future 
genetic breeding work in the Dehong humped cattle.
