Th17 cells are implicated in human autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), although it has not been established whether this persistent 
destructive arthritis is driven by Th1 and/or Th17 cells. Interleukin-17A 
(IL-17A) contributes to the pathogenesis of arthritis as has been shown in 
several experimental arthritis models. Importantly, recent data from first 
clinical trials with anti-IL-17A antibody treatment in psoriatic arthritis 
patients and RA patients looks promising. This review summarizes the findings 
about the role of Th17 cells in arthritis and discusses the impact of the 
different Th17 cytokines in the pathogenesis of this disease. However, further 
studies are needed to unravel the interplay between IL-17A and other Th17 
cytokines such as IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-21 in the pathoimmunological process of 
this crippling disease, in particular, whether regulating Th17 cell activity or 
specific combinations of Th17 cytokines will have additional value compared to 
neutralizing IL-17A activity alone. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-positive 
Th17 cells are discussed as potential dangerous cells in driving persistent 
arthritis in human early RA.
