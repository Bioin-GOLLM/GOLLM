Autophagy, a lysosome-mediated cellular degradation pathway, recycles 
intracellular components to maintain metabolic balance and survival. Autophagy 
plays an important role in tumor immunotherapy as a "double-edged sword" that 
can both promote and inhibit tumor progression. Autophagy acts on innate and 
adaptive immunity and interacts with immune cells to modulate tumor 
immunotherapy. The discovery of autophagy inducers and autophagy inhibitors also 
provides new insights for clinical anti-tumor therapy. However, there are also 
difficulties in the application of autophagy-related regulators, such as low 
bioavailability and the lack of efficient selectivity. This review focuses on 
autophagy-related immunogenic regulation and its application in cancer therapy.
