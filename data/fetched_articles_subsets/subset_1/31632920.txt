Knockdown or gene disruption of the ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor 
CD47 protects non-malignant cells from genotoxic stress caused by ionizing 
radiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy but sensitizes tumors in an immune competent 
host to genotoxic stress. The selective radioprotection of non-malignant cells 
is mediated in part by enhanced autophagy and protection of anabolic metabolism 
pathways, but differential H2AX activation kinetics suggested that the DNA 
damage response is also CD47-dependent. A high throughput screen of drug 
sensitivities indicated that CD47 expression selectively sensitizes Jurkat T 
cells to inhibitors of topoisomerases, which are known targets of Schlafen-11 
(SLFN11). CD47 mRNA expression positively correlated with schlafen-11 mRNA 
expression in a subset of human cancers but not the corresponding non-malignant 
tissues. CD47 mRNA expression was also negatively correlated with SLFN11 
promoter methylation in some cancers. CD47 knockdown, gene disruption, or 
treatment with a CD47 function-blocking antibody decreased SLFN11 expression in 
Jurkat cells. The CD47 signaling ligand thrombospondin-1 also suppressed 
schlafen-11 expression in wild type but not CD47-deficient T cells. 
Re-expressing SLFN11 restored radiosensitivity to a CD47-deficient Jurkat cells. 
Disruption of CD47 in PC3 prostate cancer cells similarly decreased schlafen-11 
expression and was associated with a CD47-dependent decrease in acetylation and 
increased methylation of histone H3 in the SLFN11 promoter region. The ability 
of histone deacetylase or topoisomerase inhibitors to induce SLFN11 expression 
in PC3 cells was lost when CD47 was targeted in these cells. Disrupting CD47 in 
PC3 cells increased resistance to etoposide but, in contrast to Jurkat cells, 
not to ionizing radiation. These data identify CD47 as a context-dependent 
regulator of SLFN11 expression and suggest an approach to improve radiotherapy 
and chemotherapy responses by combining with CD47-targeted therapeutics.
