The benefit of reporting unsolicited findings in Next Generation Sequencing 
(NGS) related to cancer genes in children may have implications for family 
members, nevertheless, could also cause distress. We aimed to retrospectively 
investigate germline variants in 94 genes implicated in oncogenesis, in patients 
referred to NGS testing for various rare genetic diseases and reevaluate the 
utility of reporting different classes of pathogenicity. We used in silico 
prediction software to classify variants and conducted manual review to examine 
unsolicited findings frequencies in 145 children with rare diseases, that 
underwent sequencing - using a 4813 gene panel. The anonymized reanalysis 
revealed 18250 variants, of which 126 were considered after filtering. Six 
pathogenic variants (in BRCA1,BMPR1A,FANCA,FANCC,NBN genes) with cancer related 
phenotype and three unsolicited variants (in BRCA2,PALB2,RAD50 genes) were 
reported to patients. Additionally, three unsolicited variants in ATR, BLM (in 
two individuals), and FANCB genes presented potential cancer susceptibility, 
were not reported to patients. In retrospect, 4.8% (7/145) of individuals in our 
cohort had unsolicited NGS findings related to cancer. More efforts are needed 
to create an updatable consensus in reporting variants in cancer predisposing 
genes, especially for children. Consent process is crucial to inform of both 
value and risk of additional genetic information.
