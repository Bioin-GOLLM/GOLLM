A study of the inheritance of malignant hyperthermia (MH) in the British 
Landrace breed revealed the same substitution of T for C at nucleotide 1843 in 
the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene that was previously shown to be correlated 
with MG in five Canadian swine breeds. Cosegregation of the mutation with MH in 
338 informative meioses led to a lod score of 101.75 for linkage at Omax = 0.0. 
The substitution was also associated with a HinPI- BanII+ RsaI- haplotype in 
this breed, as in the five breeds tested earlier, suggesting its origin in a 
common founder animal. DNA-based detection of the MH status in 376 
MH-susceptible heterozygous (N/n) and homozygous (n/n) pigs was shown to be 
accurate, eliminating the 5% diagnostic error that is associated with the 
halothane challenge test and flanking marker haplotyping procedures in current 
diagnostic use. These results strongly support the view that the substitution of 
T for C at nucleotide 1843 is the causative mutation in porcine MH and 
demonstrate the feasibility of rapid, accurate, noninvasive, large-scale testing 
for porcine MH status using DNA-based tests for the mutation.
