BACKGROUND: There is a considerable amount of literature on the potential 
relationship between human leukocyte antigen-G 14-bp Ins/Del polymorphism and 
virus infection; however, results from these studies were inconclusive.
OBJECTIVES: A meta-analysis was carried out to determine whether the 14-bp 
Ins/Del polymorphism is a susceptible factor for virus infection.
METHODS: Data were extracted from PubMed and Web of Science databases, and 
included 10 case-control studies (1835 patients and 2357 controls).
RESULTS: A total of 177 records from 10 studies were retrieved. Overall, no 
significant correlation was found between HLA-G 14-bp Ins/Del polymorphism and 
total viruses under all genetic models (dominant model: OR = 0.93, 95% 
CI = 0.68-1.29; recessive model: OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.84-1.48; 
deletion/deletion (DD) vs insertion/insertion (II): OR = 1.03, 95% 
CI = 0.71-1.49; deletion (D) vs insertion (I): OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.81-1.25). 
However, further subgroup analyses by virus type and ethnicity revealed that 
HLA-G 14-bp Ins/Del polymorphism was significantly associated with HTLV-1 
infection in mixed population under the dominant model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that HLA-G 14-bp Ins/Del polymorphism may 
not have any effect on susceptibility to viruses.
