A promoter can be regulated by various cis-acting elements so that delineation 
of the regulatory modes among them may help understand developmental, 
environmental and genetic mechanisms in gene activity. Here we report that the 
human dopamine transporter gene SLC6A3 carries a 5' distal 5-kb super enhancer 
(5KSE) which upregulated the promoter by 5-fold. Interestingly, 5KSE is able to 
prevent 3' downstream variable number tandem repeats (3'VNTRs) from silencing 
the promoter. This new enhancer consists of a 5'VNTR and three repetitive 
sub-elements that are conserved in primates. Two of 5KSE's sub-elements, E-9.7 
and E-8.7, upregulate the promoter, but only the later could continue doing so 
in the presence of 3'VNTRs. Finally, E-8.7 is activated by novel dopaminergic 
transcription factors including SRP54 and Nfe2l1. Together, these results reveal 
a multimodal regulatory mechanism in SLC6A3.
