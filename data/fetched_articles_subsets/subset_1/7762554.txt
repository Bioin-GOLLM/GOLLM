Type II oculocutaneous albinism (OCA2) is an autosomal recessive disorder in 
which the biosynthesis of melanin pigment is reduced in the skin, hair, and 
eyes. OCA2, which results from mutations of the P gene, is the most frequent 
type of albinism in African and African-American patients. OCA2 is especially 
frequent in Tanzania, where it occurs with an incidence of approximately 
1/1,400. We have identified abnormalities of the P gene in each of 13 unrelated 
patients with OCA2 from Tanzania. One of these, a deletion of exon 7, is 
strongly predominant, accounting for approximately 77% of mutant alleles in this 
group of patients.
