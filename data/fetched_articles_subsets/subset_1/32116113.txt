ABTRACT tRNA-derived fragments or tRFs were long considered merely degradation 
intermediates of full-length tRNAs; however, emerging research is highlighting 
unanticipated new and highly distinct functions in epigenetic control, 
metabolism, immune activity and stem cell fate commitment. Importantly, recent 
studies suggest that RNA epitranscriptomic modifications may provide an 
additional regulatory layer that dynamically directs tRF activity in stem and 
cancer cells. In this review, we explore current work illustrating unanticipated 
roles of tRFs in mammalian stem cells with a focus on the impact of 
post-transcriptional RNA modifications for the biogenesis and function of this 
growing class of small noncoding RNAs.
