Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare but highly 
relevant disorder in pediatric nephrology. This genetic disease is mainly caused 
by variants in the PKHD1 gene and is characterized by fibrocystic hepatorenal 
phenotypes with major clinical variability. ARPKD frequently presents 
perinatally, and the management of perinatal and early disease symptoms may be 
challenging. This review discusses aspects of early manifestations in ARPKD and 
its clincial management with a special focus on kidney disease.
