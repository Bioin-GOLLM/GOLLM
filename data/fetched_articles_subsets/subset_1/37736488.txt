There are several methods to control a heart rate, such as electrical 
stimulation and drug administration. However, these methods may be invasive or 
affect other organs. Recently, an optogenetic-based cardiac pacing method has 
enabled us to stimulate the cardiac muscle in non-contact. In many previous 
studies, the pacing was applied ex vivo or in anesthetized animals. Therefore, 
the physiologic response of animals during optogenetic pacing remains unclear. 
Here, we established a method of optogenetic-based cardiac pacing in awake, 
freely moving mice and simultaneously measured electrocardiogram, blood 
pressure, and respiration. As a result, light-induced myocardial contraction 
produces blood flow and indirectly affects the respiration rhythm. Additionally, 
light illumination enabled heart rate recovery in bradycardic mice. These 
findings may be employed for further research that relates a heartbeat state to 
animal behavior. Together, this method may drive the development of less 
invasive pacemakers without pacing leads.
