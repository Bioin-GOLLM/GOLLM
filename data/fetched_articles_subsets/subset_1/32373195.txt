Solute carriers (SLCs) are the largest family of transmembrane transporters that 
determine the exchange of various substances, including nutrients, ions, 
metabolites, and drugs across biological membranes. To date, the presence of 
about 287 SLC genes have been identified in the brain, among which mutations or 
the resultant dysfunctions of 71 SLC genes have been reported to be correlated 
with human brain disorders. Although increasing interest in SLCs have focused on 
drug development, SLCs are currently still under-explored as drug targets, 
especially in the brain. We summarize the main substrates and functions of SLCs 
that are expressed in the brain, with an emphasis on selected SLCs that are 
important physiologically, pathologically, and pharmacologically in the 
blood-brain barrier, astrocytes, and neurons. Evidence suggests that a fraction 
of SLCs are regulated along with the occurrences of brain disorders, among which 
epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, and autism are representative. Given the 
review of SLCs involved in the onset and procession of brain disorders, we hope 
these SLCs will be screened as promising drug targets to improve drug delivery 
to the brain.
