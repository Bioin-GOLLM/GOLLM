In colorectal cancer (CRC), aberrant Wnt signalling is essential for 
tumorigenesis and maintenance of cancer stem cells. However, how other oncogenic 
pathways converge on Wnt signalling to modulate stem cell homeostasis in CRC 
currently remains poorly understood. Using large-scale compound screens in CRC, 
we identify MEK1/2 inhibitors as potent activators of Wnt/β-catenin signalling. 
Targeting MEK increases Wnt activity in different CRC cell lines and murine 
intestine in vivo. Truncating mutations of APC generated by CRISPR/Cas9 strongly 
synergize with MEK inhibitors in enhancing Wnt responses in isogenic CRC models. 
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that MEK inhibition induces a rapid 
downregulation of AXIN1. Using patient-derived CRC organoids, we show that MEK 
inhibition leads to increased Wnt activity, elevated LGR5 levels and enrichment 
of gene signatures associated with stemness and cancer relapse. Our study 
demonstrates that clinically used MEK inhibitors inadvertently induce stem cell 
plasticity, revealing an unknown side effect of RAS pathway inhibition.
