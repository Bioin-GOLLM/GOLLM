BACKGROUND: A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is of high urgency. Here the safety and 
immunogenicity induced by a DNA vaccine (INO-4800) targeting the full length 
spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 are described.
METHODS: INO-4800 was evaluated in two groups of 20 participants, receiving 
either 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg of vaccine intradermally followed by CELLECTRA® EP at 0 
and 4 weeks. Thirty-nine subjects completed both doses; one subject in the 
2.0 mg group discontinued trial participation prior to receiving the second 
dose. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04336410.
FINDINGS: The median age was 34.5, 55% (22/40) were men and 82.5% (33/40) white. 
Through week 8, only 6 related Grade 1 adverse events in 5 subjects were 
observed. None of these increased in frequency with the second administration. 
No serious adverse events were reported. All 38 subjects evaluable for 
immunogenicity had cellular and/or humoral immune responses following the second 
dose of INO-4800. By week 6, 95% (36/38) of the participants seroconverted based 
on their responses by generating binding (ELISA) and/or neutralizing antibodies 
(PRNT IC50), with responder geometric mean binding antibody titers of 655.5 [95% 
CI (255.6, 1681.0)] and 994.2 [95% CI (395.3, 2500.3)] in the 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg 
groups, respectively. For neutralizing antibody, 78% (14/18) and 84% (16/19) 
generated a response with corresponding geometric mean titers of 102.3 [95% CI 
(37.4, 280.3)] and 63.5 [95% CI (39.6, 101.8)], in the respective groups. By 
week 8, 74% (14/19) and 100% (19/19) of subjects generated T cell responses by 
IFN-ɣ ELISpot assay with the median SFU per 106 PBMC of 46 [95% CI (21.1, 
142.2)] and 71 [95% CI (32.2, 194.4)] in the 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg groups, 
respectively. Flow cytometry demonstrated a T cell response, dominated by CD8+ T 
cells co-producing IFN-ɣ and TNF-α, without increase in IL-4.
INTERPRETATION: INO-4800 demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability and was 
immunogenic in 100% (38/38) of the vaccinated subjects by eliciting either or 
both humoral or cellular immune responses.
