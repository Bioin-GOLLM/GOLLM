Among all cancers in women, breast cancer has the highest incidence. The 
mortality of breast cancer is highly associated with metastasis. Migration and 
malignant transformation of cancer cells have been reported to be modulated by 
store-operated calcium (SOC) channels, which control calcium signaling and cell 
proliferation pathways. Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a calcium 
sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering the activation of store-operated 
calcium signaling. However, the clinical relevance of STIM1 in breast cancer is 
still unclear. Here, we recruited 348 breast cancer patients and conducted a 
genetic association study to address this question. Four tagging germline single 
nucleotide variants (SNVs) in STIM1 were selected and RNA sequencing data of 525 
breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were 
evaluated. The results show that rs2304891 and rs3750996 were correlated with 
clinical stage of breast cancer. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) 
analysis indicated that risk G allele of STIM1 contributed to the higher 
expression of STIM1. In addition, we found an increased risk of rs2304891 G 
allele and rs3750996 A allele in estrogen receptor (ER) positive and 
progesterone receptor (PR) positive patients. In conclusion, our results suggest 
that germline SNV, rs2304891 and rs3750996 as well as STIM1 expression are 
important biomarkers for the prediction of clinical outcomes in breast cancer 
patients.
