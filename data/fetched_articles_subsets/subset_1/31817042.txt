Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT5 are important 
transcription factors that are able to mediate or even drive cancer progression 
through hyperactivation or gain-of-function mutations. Mutated STAT3 is mainly 
associated with large granular lymphocytic T-cell leukemia, whereas mutated 
STAT5B is associated with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, T-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia and γδ T-cell-derived lymphomas. Hyperactive STAT3 and 
STAT5 are also implicated in various hematopoietic and solid malignancies, such 
as chronic and acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma or prostate cancer. Classical 
understanding of STAT functions is linked to their phosphorylated parallel dimer 
conformation, in which they induce gene transcription. However, the functions of 
STAT proteins are not limited to their phosphorylated dimerization form. In this 
review, we discuss the functions and the roles of unphosphorylated STAT3/5 in 
the context of chromatin remodeling, as well as the impact of STAT5 
oligomerization on differential gene expression in hematopoietic neoplasms. The 
central involvement of STAT3/5 in cancer has made these molecules attractive 
targets for small-molecule drug development, but currently there are no direct 
STAT3/5 inhibitors of clinical grade available. We summarize the development of 
inhibitors against the SH2 domains of STAT3/5 and discuss their applicability as 
cancer therapeutics.
