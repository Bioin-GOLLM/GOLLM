Echinoderms form a remarkable phylum of marine invertebrates that present 
specific chemical signatures unique in the animal kingdom. It is particularly 
the case for essential triterpenoids that evolved separately in each of the five 
echinoderm classes. Indeed, while most animals have Δ5-sterols, sea cucumbers 
(Holothuroidea) and sea stars (Asteroidea) also possess Δ7 and Δ9(11)-sterols, a 
characteristic not shared with brittle stars (Ophiuroidea), sea urchins 
(Echinoidea), and crinoids (Crinoidea). These particular Δ7 and Δ9(11) sterols 
emerged as a self-protection against membranolytic saponins that only sea 
cucumbers and sea stars produce as a defense mechanism. The diversity of 
saponins is large; several hundred molecules have been described in the two 
classes of these saponins (i.e., triterpenoid or steroid saponins). This review 
aims to highlight the diversity of triterpenoids in echinoderms by focusing on 
sterols and triterpenoid glycosides, but more importantly to provide an updated 
view of the biosynthesis of these molecules in echinoderms.
