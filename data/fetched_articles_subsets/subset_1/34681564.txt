The synthetic peptide T11F (TCRVDHRGLTF), with sequence identical to a fragment 
of the constant region of human IgM, and most of its alanine-substituted 
derivatives proved to possess a significant candidacidal activity in vitro. In 
this study, the therapeutic efficacy of T11F, D5A, the derivative most active in 
vitro, and F11A, characterized by a different conformation, was investigated in 
Galleria mellonella larvae infected with Candida albicans. A single injection of 
F11A and D5A derivatives, in contrast with T11F, led to a significant increase 
in survival of larvae injected with a lethal inoculum of C. albicans cells, in 
comparison with infected animals treated with saline. Peptide modulation of host 
immunity upon C. albicans infection was determined by hemocyte analysis and 
larval histology, highlighting a different immune stimulation by the studied 
peptides. F11A, particularly, was the most active in eliciting nodule formation, 
melanization and fat body activation, leading to a better control of yeast 
infection. Overall, the obtained data suggest a double role for F11A, able to 
simultaneously target the fungus and the host immune system, resulting in a more 
efficient pathogen clearance.
