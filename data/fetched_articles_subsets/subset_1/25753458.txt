BACKGROUND: Catecholamine-O-methyl-tranferase (COMT) initiates dopamine 
degradation. Its activity is mainly determined by a single nucleotide 
polymorphism in the COMT gene (Val158Met, rs4680) separating high (Val/Val, 
COMT(HH)), intermediate (Val/Met, COMT(HL)) and low metabolizers (Met/Met, 
COMT(LL)). We investigated dopaminergic denervation in the striatum in PD 
patients according to COMT rs4680 genotype.
METHODS: Patients with idiopathic PD were assessed for motor severity (UPDRS-III 
rating scale in OFF-state), dopaminergic denervation using [123I]-FP-CIT SPECT 
imaging, and genotyped for the COMT rs4680 enzyme. [123I]-FP-CIT binding 
potential (BP) for each voxel was defined by the ratio of tracer-binding in the 
region of interest (striatum, caudate nucleus and putamen) to that in a region 
of non-specific activity. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan(®) SNP 
genotyping assay. We used a regression model to evaluate the effect of COMT 
genotype on the BP in the striatum and its sub-regions.
RESULTS: Genotype distribution was: 11 (27.5%) COMT(HH), 26 (65%) COMT(HL) and 3 
(7.5%) COMT(LL). There were no significant differences in disease severity, 
treatments, or motor scores between genotypes. When adjusted to clinical 
severity, gender and age, low and intermediate metabolizers showed significantly 
higher rates of striatal denervation (COMT(HL+LL) BP = 1.32 ± 0.04) than high 
metabolizers (COMT(HH), BP = 1.6 ± 0.08; F(1.34) = 9.0, p = 0.005). Striatal 
sub-regions showed similar results. BP and UPDRS-III motor scores (r = 0.44, 
p = 0.04) (p < 0.001) were highly correlated. There was a gender effect, but no 
gender-genotype interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Striatal denervation differs according to COMT-Val158Met 
polymorphism. COMT activity may play a role as a compensatory mechanism in PD 
motor symptoms.
