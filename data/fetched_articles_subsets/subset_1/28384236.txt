Cancer is a significant public health problem worldwide. Complete identification 
of genes related to one type of cancer facilitates earlier diagnosis and 
effective treatments. In this study, two widely used algorithms, the random walk 
with restart algorithm and the shortest path algorithm, were adopted to 
construct two parameterized computational methods, namely, an RWR-based method 
and an SP-based method; based on these methods, an integrated method was 
constructed for identifying novel disease genes. To validate the utility of the 
integrated method, data for oral cancer were used, on which the RWR-based and 
SP-based methods were trained, thereby building two optimal methods. The 
integrated method combining these optimal methods was further adopted to 
identify the novel genes of oral cancer. As a result, 85 novel genes were 
inferred, among which eleven genes (e.g., MYD88, FGFR2, NF-ÎºBIA) were identified 
by both the RWR-based and SP-based methods, 70 genes (e.g., BMP4, IFNG, KITLG) 
were discovered only by the RWR-based method and four genes (L1R1, MCM6, NOG and 
CXCR3) were predicted only by the SP-based method. Extensive analyses indicate 
that several novel genes have strong associations with cancers, indicating the 
effectiveness of the integrated method for identifying disease genes.
