Non-specific lipid-transfer proteins (nsLTPs) represent a family of plant 
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) implicated in diverse physiological processes. 
However, their role in induced resistance (IR) triggered by non-pathogenic 
fungal strains and their metabolites is poorly understood. In this work, using 
RNA-seq data and our AMP search pipeline, we analyzed the repertoire of nsLTP 
genes in the wheat Triticum kiharae and studied their expression in response to 
Fusarium oxysporum infection and treatment with the intracellular metabolites of 
Fusarium sambucinum FS-94. A total of 243 putative nsLTPs were identified, which 
were classified into five structural types and characterized. Expression 
analysis showed that 121 TkLTPs including sets of paralogs with identical mature 
peptides displayed specific expression patters in response to different 
treatments pointing to their diverse roles in resistance development. We 
speculate that upregulated nsLTP genes are involved in protection due to their 
antimicrobial activity or signaling functions. Furthermore, we discovered that 
in IR-displaying plants, a vast majority of nsLTP genes were downregulated, 
suggesting their role as negative regulators of immune mechanisms activated by 
the FS-94 elicitors. The results obtained add to our knowledge of the role of 
nsLTPs in IR and provide candidate molecules for genetic engineering of crops to 
enhance disease resistance.
