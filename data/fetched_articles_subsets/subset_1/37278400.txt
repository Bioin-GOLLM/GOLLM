Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic cancer worldwide, and the 
therapeutic options are limited. PARP inhibitor (PARPi) represents an effective 
therapeutic strategy and has been approved for maintenance therapy. However, the 
intrinsic or acquired resistance to PARPi becomes a big challenge. To 
investigate the mechanisms for PARPi resistance, we analysed public databases 
and established Olaparib-resistant ovarian cancer cells for exploration. Our 
results showed that the inflammatory pathway and adenosine receptor A2b 
(Adora2b/A2B ) expression were significantly increased in Olaparib-resistant 
cells. A2B was highly expressed in recurrent ovarian tumours and negatively 
correlated with the clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Olaparib treatment 
enhanced A2B expression through NF-κB activation. The elevated A2B contributed 
to Olaparib resistance by sensing adenosine signal and promoting tumour cell 
survival, growth and migration via IL-6-STAT3 signalling. Therefore, inhibition 
of A2B -IL-6-STAT3 axis could overcome Olaparib resistance and synergize with 
Olaparib to reduce cancer cell growth and lead to cell death. Our findings 
reveal a critical role of A2B signalling in mediating PARPi resistance 
independent of DNA damage repair, providing insights into developing novel 
therapies in ovarian cancers.
