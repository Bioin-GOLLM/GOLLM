Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a recently described membrane-bound 
carboxypeptidase identified by its homology to ACE, the enzyme responsible for 
the formation of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Ang II). ACE2 
inactivates Ang II and is thus thought to act in a counter-regulatory fashion to 
ACE. ACE2 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of distal renal tubules, and 
recent evidence indicates that expression is increased in a range of renal 
diseases. A soluble form of ACE, generated by proteolytic cleavage of the 
membrane-bound form, has been shown to be present in urine; although evidence 
for a similar release of ACE2 has been reported in cell culture, it is not yet 
known whether this occurs in vivo. The present study has identified ACE2 in 
human urine, both by a sensitive fluorescence-based activity assay and by 
Western immunoblot. Levels of ACE2 were surprisingly higher than ACE, which may 
reflect preferential targeting of the enzyme to the luminal surface of the renal 
epithelium. Future studies will determine whether increased expression of ACE2 
in renal diseases are reflected in higher urinary levels of this novel enzyme.
