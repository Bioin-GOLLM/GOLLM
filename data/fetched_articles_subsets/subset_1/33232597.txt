BACKGROUND: As the genetic variants of trabecular bone microarchitecture are not 
well-understood, we performed a genome-wide association study to identify 
genetic determinants of bone microarchitecture analyzed by trabecular bone score 
(TBS).
METHODS: TBS-associated genes were discovered in the Ansung cohort (discovery 
cohort), a community-based rural cohort in Korea, and then validated in the 
Gene-Environment Interaction and Phenotype (GENIE) cohort (validation cohort), 
consisting of subjects who underwent health check-up programs. In the discovery 
cohort, 2,451 participants were investigated for 1.42 million genotyped and 
imputed markers.
RESULTS: In the validation cohort, identified as significant variants were 
evaluated in 2,733 participants. An intronic variant in iroquois homeobox 3 
(IRX3), rs1815994, was significantly associated with TBS in men (P=3.74E-05 in 
the discovery cohort, P=0.027 in the validation cohort). Another intronic 
variant in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MAP2K5), rs11630730, was 
significantly associated with TBS in women (P=3.05E-09 in the discovery cohort, 
P=0.041 in the validation cohort). Men with the rs1815994 variant and women with 
the rs11630730 variant had lower TBS and lumbar spine bone mineral density. The 
detrimental effects of the rs1815994 variant in men and rs11630730 variant in 
women were also identified in association analysis (β=-0.0281, β=-0.0465, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: In this study, the rs1815994 near IRX3 in men and rs11630730 near 
MAP2K5 in women were associated with deterioration of the bone 
microarchitecture. It is the first study to determine the association of genetic 
variants with TBS. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and 
identify additional variants contributing to the trabecular bone 
microarchitecture.
