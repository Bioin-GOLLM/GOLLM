Rationale: It is known that neuroinflammation plays a critical and detrimental 
role in the development of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), but the 
regulation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-mediated innate immune response 
in I/R-induced neuroinflammation is largely unexplored. This study aimed to 
investigate the function and regulatory mechanism of cGAS in I/R-induced 
neuroinflammation and brain injury, and to identify possible strategies for the 
treatment of ischemic stroke. Methods: To demonstrate that microglial histone 
deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) regulates the microglial cGAS-stimulator of interferon 
genes (cGAS-STING) pathway and is involved in I/R-induced neuroinflammation and 
brain injury, a series of cell biological, molecular, and biochemical approaches 
were utilized. These approaches include transient middle cerebral artery 
occlusion (tMCAO), real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RNA sequencing, 
western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, chromosome-immunoprecipitation, 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), dual-luciferase reporter assay, 
immunohistochemistry, and confocal imaging. Results: The microglial cGAS- STING 
pathway was activated by mitochondrial DNA, which promoted the formation of a 
pro-inflammatory microenvironment. In addition, we revealed that HDAC3 
transcriptionally promoted the expression of cGAS and potentiated the activation 
of the cGAS-STING pathway by regulating the acetylation and nuclear localization 
of p65 in microglia. Our in vivo results indicated that deletion of cGAS or 
HDAC3 in microglia attenuated I/R-induced neuroinflammation and brain injury. 
Conclusion: Collectively, we elucidated that the HDAC3-p65-cGAS-STING pathway is 
involved in the development of I/R-induced neuroinflammation, identifying a new 
therapeutic avenue for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
