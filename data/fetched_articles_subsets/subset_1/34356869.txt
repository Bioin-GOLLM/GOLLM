Increasing evidence has cast doubt over the HDL-cholesterol hypothesis. The 
complexity of the HDL particle and its proven susceptibility to remodel has 
paved the way for intense molecular investigation. This state-of-the-art review 
discusses the molecular changes in HDL particles that help to explain the 
failure of large clinical trials intending to interfere with HDL metabolism, and 
details the chemical modifications and compositional changes in HDL-forming 
components, as well as miRNA cargo, that render HDL particles ineffective. 
Finally, the paper discusses the challenges that need to be overcome to shed a 
light of hope on HDL-targeted approaches.
