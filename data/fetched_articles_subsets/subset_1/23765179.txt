It is now well established that metastatic colorectal cancer patients without 
KRAS mutation (codon 12) benefit from treatment with an epidermal growth factor 
receptor monoclonal antibody (anti-EGFR mAb). Recently, EFGR and KRAS mutations 
have been shown to exist in patients who developed resistance to anti-EGFR mAb. 
We analyzed KRAS, BRAF V600E and EGFR S492R mutations in 37 post-anti-EGFR mAb 
tumor samples from 23 patients treated with chemotherapy plus anti-EGFR mAb. No 
EGFR S492R mutation was detected. A KRAS mutation was found after anti-EGFR mAb 
in only one tumor. Our results suggest that acquired EGFR S492R and KRAS 
mutations do not constitute the main mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR mAb in 
combination with chemotherapy.
