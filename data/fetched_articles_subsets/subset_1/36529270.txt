BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) is a treatable 
disorder of bile acid synthesis caused by deficiency of 27-sterol hydroxylase 
-encoded by CYP27A1- leading to gastrointestinal and progressive 
neuropsychiatric symptoms. Biochemically, CTX is characterized by accumulation 
of the bile alcohol cholestanetetrol glucuronide (GlcA-tetrol) and the 
deficiency of tauro-chenodeoxycholic acid (t-CDCA) and 
tauro-trihydroxycholestanoic acid (t-THCA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To ascertain the feasibility of CTX newborn screening 
(NBS) we performed a study with deidentified Dutch dried blood spots using 
reagents and equipment that is frequently used in NBS laboratories. 20,076 
deidentified newborn blood spots were subjected to flow-injection (FIA)-MS/MS 
and UPLC-MS/MS analysis to determine the concentration of GlcA-tetrol and 
calculate the GlcA-tetrol/t-CDCA and t-THCA/GlcA-tetrol ratios.
RESULTS: Using UPLC-MS/MS analysis both GlcA-tetrol concentration and/or 
metabolite ratios GlcA-tetrol/t-CDCA proved to be informative biomarkers; 
newborn DBS results did not overlap with those of the CTX patients. For 
FIA-MS/MS, GlcA-tetrol also was an excellent marker but when using the 
combination of the GlcA-tetrol/t-CDCA and t-THCA/GlcA-tetrol ratios also did not 
yield any screen positives.
CONCLUSION: Newborn screening for CTX using only metabolite ratios following the 
measurement of three CTX biomarkers is possible using either FIA-MS/MS or 
UPLC-MS/MS, which paves the way for introduction of CTX NBS.
