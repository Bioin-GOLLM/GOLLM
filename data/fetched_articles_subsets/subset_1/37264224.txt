BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a broad-spectrum disease, spanning from indolent 
to a highly aggressive lethal malignancy. Prostate cancer cell lines are 
essential tools to understanding the basic features of this malignancy, as well 
as in identifying novel therapeutic strategies. However, most cell lines 
routinely used in prostate cancer research are derived from metastatic disease 
and may not fully elucidate the molecular events underlying the early stages of 
cancer development and progression. Thus, there is a need for new cell lines 
derived from localised disease to better span the disease spectrum.
METHODS: Prostatic tissue from the primary site, and adjacent non-cancerous 
tissue was obtained from four patients with localised disease undergoing radical 
prostatectomy. Epithelial cell outgrowths were immortalised with human 
papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6 and E7 to establish monoclonal cell lines. 
Chromosomal ploidy was imaged and STR profiles were determined. Cell morphology, 
colony formation and cell proliferation characteristics were assessed. Androgen 
receptor (AR) expression and AR-responsiveness to androgen treatment were 
analysed by immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR, respectively. RNA-seq analysis was 
performed to identify prostate lineage markers and expression of prostate cancer 
tumorigenesis-related genes.
RESULTS: Two benign cell lines derived from non-cancer cells (AQ0420 and AQ0396) 
and two tumour tissue derived cancer cell lines (AQ0411 and AQ0415) were 
immortalised from four patients with localised prostatic adenocarcinoma. The 
cell lines presented an epithelial morphology and a slow to moderate 
proliferative rate. None of the cell lines formed anchorage independent colonies 
or displayed AR-responsiveness. Comparative RNA-seq expression analysis 
confirmed the prostatic lineage of the four cell lines, with a distinct gene 
expression profile from that of the metastatic prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 
and LNCaP.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive characterization of these cell lines may provide new 
in vitro tools that could bridge the current knowledge gap between benign, 
early-stage and metastatic disease.
