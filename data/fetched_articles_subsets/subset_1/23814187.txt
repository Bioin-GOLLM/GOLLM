DNA polymerases must accurately replicate DNA to maintain genome integrity. 
Carcinogenic adducts, such as 2-aminofluorene (AF) and N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene 
(AAF), covalently bind DNA bases and promote mutagenesis near the adduct site. 
The mechanism by which carcinogenic adducts inhibit DNA synthesis and cause 
mutagenesis remains unclear. Here, we measure interactions between a DNA 
polymerase and carcinogenic DNA adducts in real-time by single-molecule 
fluorescence. We find the degree to which an adduct affects polymerase binding 
to the DNA depends on the adduct location with respect to the primer terminus, 
the adduct structure and the nucleotides present in the solution. Not only do 
the adducts influence the polymerase dwell time on the DNA but also its binding 
position and orientation. Finally, we have directly observed an adduct- and 
mismatch-induced intermediate state, which may be an obligatory step in the DNA 
polymerase proofreading mechanism.
