Methylation of DNA is an essential epigenetic control mechanism in mammals. 
During embryonic development, cells are directed toward their future lineages, 
and DNA methylation poses a fundamental epigenetic barrier that guides and 
restricts differentiation and prevents regression into an undifferentiated 
state. DNA methylation also plays an important role in sex chromosome dosage 
compensation, the repression of retrotransposons that threaten genome integrity, 
the maintenance of genome stability, and the coordinated expression of imprinted 
genes. However, DNA methylation marks must be globally removed to allow for 
sexual reproduction and the adoption of the specialized, hypomethylated 
epigenome of the primordial germ cell and the preimplantation embryo. Recent 
technological advances in genome-wide DNA methylation analysis and the 
functional description of novel enzymatic DNA demethylation pathways have 
provided significant insights into the molecular processes that prepare the 
mammalian embryo for normal development.
