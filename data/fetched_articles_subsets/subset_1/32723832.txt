BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% of patients with the systemic 
autoimmune/inflammatory disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop 
lupus nephritis (LN) that affects treatment and prognosis. Easily accessible 
biomarkers do not exist to reliably predict renal disease. The Maximizing SLE 
Therapeutic Potential by Application of Novel and Systemic Approaches and the 
Engineering Consortium aims to identify indicators of treatment responses in 
SLE. This study tested the applicability of calcium-binding S100 proteins in 
serum and urine as biomarkers for disease activity and response to treatment 
with rituximab (RTX) in LN.
METHODS: S100A8/A9 and S100A12 proteins were quantified in the serum and urine 
of 243 patients with SLE from the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Biologics 
Register (BILAG-BR) study and 48 controls matched for age using Meso Scale 
Discovery's technology to determine whether they perform as biomarkers for 
active LN and/or may be used to predict response to treatment with RTX. Renal 
disease activity and response to treatment was based on BILAG-BR scores and 
changes in response to treatment.
RESULTS: Serum S100A12 (p<0.001), and serum and urine S100A8/A9 (p<0.001) levels 
are elevated in patients with SLE. While serum and urine S100 levels do not 
correlate with global disease activity (SLE Disease Activity Index), levels in 
urine and urine/serum ratios are elevated in patients with active LN. S100 
proteins perform better as biomarkers for active LN involvement in patients with 
SLE who tested positive for anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. Binary logistic 
regression and area under the curve analyses suggest the combination of serum 
S100A8/A9 and S100A12 can predict response to RTX treatment in LN after 
6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study show promise for clinical application of 
S100 proteins to predict active renal disease in SLE and response to treatment 
with RTX.
