The most common cause of early onset primary dystonia, a neuromuscular disease, 
is a glutamate deletion (ΔE) at position 302/303 of TorsinA, a AAA+ ATPase that 
resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. While the function of TorsinA remains 
elusive, the ΔE mutation is known to diminish binding of two TorsinA ATPase 
activators: lamina-associated protein 1 (LAP1) and its paralog, luminal domain 
like LAP1 (LULL1). Using a nanobody as a crystallization chaperone, we obtained 
a 1.4 Å crystal structure of human TorsinA in complex with LULL1. This nanobody 
likewise stabilized the weakened TorsinAΔE-LULL1 interaction, which enabled us 
to solve its structure at 1.4 Å also. A comparison of these structures shows, in 
atomic detail, the subtle differences in activator interactions that separate 
the healthy from the diseased state. This information may provide a structural 
platform for drug development, as a small molecule that rescues TorsinAΔE could 
serve as a cure for primary dystonia.
