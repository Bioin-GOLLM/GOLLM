The sensitivity limitations for magnetic resonance imaging of organic molecules 
have recently been addressed by hyperpolarization methods, which prepare excess 
nuclear spin polarization. This approach can increase sensitivity by orders of 
magnitude, but the enhanced signal relaxes away in tens of seconds, even in 
favorable cases. Here we show theoretically that singlet states between strongly 
coupled spins in molecules can be used to store and retrieve population in 
very-long-lived disconnected eigenstates, as long as the coupling between the 
spins substantially exceeds both the couplings to other spins and the resonance 
frequency difference between them. Experimentally, 2,3-carbon-13-labeled 
diacetyl has a disconnected eigenstate that can store population for minutes and 
is read out by hydration to make the two spins inequivalent.
