Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders are often found in patients affected 
by DiGeorge/velo-cardio-facial syndrome (DGS/VCFS) as a result of hemizygosity 
of chromosome 22q11.2. We evaluated the UFD1L gene, mapping within the DGS/VCFS 
region, as a potential candidate for schizophrenia susceptibility. UFD1L encodes 
for the ubiquitin fusion degradation 1 protein, which is expressed in the medial 
telencephalon during mouse development. Using case control, simplex families 
(trios), and functional studies, we provided evidence for association between 
schizophrenia and a single nucleotide functional polymorphism, -277A/G, located 
within the noncoding region upstream the first exon of the UFD1L gene. The 
results are supportive of UFD1L involvement in the neurodevelopmental origin of 
schizophrenia and contribute in delineating etiological and pathogenetic 
mechanism of the schizophrenia subtype related to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
