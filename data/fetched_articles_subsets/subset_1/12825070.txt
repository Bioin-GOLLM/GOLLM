In the course of positional cloning of the Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia 
type I (CDAI) [MIM 224120] gene on 15q15.1-15.3, we examined a family of French 
origin, in which the propositus suffered from asthenoteratozoospermia and 
nonsyndromic deafness in addition to CDAI. Two of his brothers had a similar 
phenotype. All three siblings were homozygous carriers of the CDA1 mutation as 
well as of a distally located approximately 70 kb deletion of the proximal copy 
of a 106 kb tandem repeat on chromosome 15q15. These repeats encode four genes 
whose distal copies may be considered pseudogenes. Lack of functional 
stereocilin and CATSPER2 (a voltage-gate cation channel expressed specifically 
in spermatozoa) may explain the observed deafness and male infertility 
phenotypes. To the best of our knowledge, the involvement of CATSPER2 in 
asthenoteratozoospermia is the first description of a human autosomal gene 
defect associated with nonsyndromic male infertility.
