The evolution of the immune system, diet, and the microbiome are interconnected. 
Dietary metabolites modulate the cells of the immune system both directly and 
indirectly via shifts in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and its 
products. As a result, overconsumption and malnutrition can have substantial 
effects on immune responses and inflammation. In resource-rich nations, diets 
high in processed foods, fat, and sugar can contribute to chronic inflammatory 
conditions, which are on the rise worldwide. Conversely, in resource-poor 
countries, malnutrition associated with food insecurity can lead to 
immunodeficiencies and shifts in the microbiome that drive intestinal 
inflammation. Developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between 
diet, microbiota, and the immune system is of huge importance, given its impact 
on inflammatory diseases and its potential as an easily modifiable mediator of 
immunomodulation.
