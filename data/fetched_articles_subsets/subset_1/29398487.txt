Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is the most common inherited disorder of sulfur 
amino acid metabolism caused by deficiency in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) 
activity and characterized by severe elevation of homocysteine in blood and 
tissues. Treatment with dietary methionine restriction is not optimal, and poor 
compliance leads to serious complications. We developed an enzyme replacement 
therapy (ERT) and studied its efficacy in a severe form of HCU in mouse (the 
I278T model). Treatment was initiated before or after the onset of clinical 
symptoms in an effort to prevent or reverse the phenotype. ERT substantially 
reduced and sustained plasma homocysteine concentration at around 100 μM and 
normalized plasma cysteine for up to 9 months of treatment. Biochemical balance 
was also restored in the liver, kidney, and brain. Furthermore, ERT corrected 
liver glucose and lipid metabolism. The treatment prevented or reversed facial 
alopecia, fragile and lean phenotype, and low bone mass. In addition, 
structurally defective ciliary zonules in the eyes of I278T mice contained low 
density and/or broken fibers, while administration of ERT from birth partially 
rescued the ocular phenotype. In conclusion, ERT maintained an improved 
metabolic pattern and ameliorated many of the clinical complications in the 
I278T mouse model of HCU.
