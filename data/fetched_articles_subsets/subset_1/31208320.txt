BACKGROUND: The introduction of genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR libraries has 
facilitated cell-based screens to identify loss-of-function mutations associated 
with a phenotype of interest. Approaches to perform analogous gain-of-function 
screens are less common, although some reports have utilized arrayed viral 
expression libraries or the CRISPR activation system. However, a variety of 
technical and logistical challenges make these approaches difficult for many 
labs to execute. In addition, genome-wide shRNA or CRISPR libraries typically 
contain of hundreds of thousands of individual engineered elements, and the 
associated complexity creates issues with replication and reproducibility for 
these methods.
RESULTS: Here we describe a simple, reproducible approach using the SB 
transposon system to perform phenotypic cell-based genetic screens. This 
approach employs only three plasmids to perform unbiased, whole-genome 
transposon mutagenesis. We also describe a ligation-mediated PCR method that can 
be used in conjunction with the included software tools to map raw sequence 
data, identify candidate genes associated with phenotypes of interest, and 
predict the impact of recurrent transposon insertions on candidate gene 
function. Finally, we demonstrate the high reproducibility of our approach by 
having three individuals perform independent replicates of a mutagenesis screen 
to identify drivers of vemurafenib resistance in cultured melanoma cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our work establishes a facile, adaptable method that 
can be performed by labs of any size to perform robust, genome-wide screens to 
identify genes that influence phenotypes of interest.
