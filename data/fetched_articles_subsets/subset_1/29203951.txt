It has recently been shown that cancer treatments such as radiation and 
hyperthermia, which have conventionally been viewed to have modest immune based 
anti-cancer effects, may, if used appropriately stimulate a significant and 
potentially effective local and systemic anti-cancer immune effect (abscopal 
effect) and improved prognosis. Using eight spontaneous canine cancers (2 oral 
melanoma, 3 oral amelioblastomas and 1 carcinomas), we have shown that 
hypofractionated radiation (6 x 6 Gy) and/or magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia 
(2 X 43°C / 45 minutes) and/or an immunogenic virus-like nanoparticle (VLP, 2 x 
200 μg) are capable of delivering a highly effective cancer treatment that 
includes an immunogenic component. Two tumors received all three therapeutic 
modalities, one tumor received radiation and hyperthermia, two tumors received 
radiation and VLP, and three tumors received only mNP hyperthermia. The 
treatment regimen is conducted over a 14-day period. All patients tolerated the 
treatments without complication and have had local and distant tumor responses 
that significantly exceed responses observed following conventional therapy 
(surgery and/or radiation). The results suggest that both hypofractionated 
radiation and hyperthermia have effective immune responses that are enhanced by 
the intratumoral VLP treatment. Molecular data from these tumors suggest Heat 
Shock Protein (HSP) 70/90, calreticulin and CD47 are targets that can be 
exploited to enhance the local and systemic (abscopal effect) immune potential 
of radiation and hyperthermia cancer treatment.
