BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and 
ulcerative colitis (UC), result from the combined effects of susceptibility 
genes and environmental factors. Polymorphisms in genes regulating inflammation 
may explain part of the genetic heritage.
METHODS: Using a candidate gene approach, 39 mainly functional single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in 26 genes regulating inflammation were assessed in a 
clinical homogeneous group of severely diseased patients consisting of 624 
patients with CD, 411 patients with UC and 795 controls. The results were 
analysed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Sixteen polymorphisms in 13 genes involved in regulation of 
inflammation were associated with risk of CD and/or UC (p ≤ 0.05). The 
polymorphisms TLR2 (rs1816702), NFKB1 (rs28362491), TNFRSF1A (rs4149570), IL6R 
(rs4537545), IL23R (rs11209026) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) were associated with risk 
of CD and the polymorphisms TLR2 (rs1816702), TLR4 (rs1554973 and rs12377632), 
TLR9 (rs352139), LY96 (rs11465996), NFKBIA (rs696), TNFA (rs1800629), TNFRSF1A 
(rs4149570), IL10 (rs3024505), IL23R (rs11209026), PTPN22 (rs2476601) and PPARG 
(rs1801282) were associated with risk of UC. When including all patients (IBD) 
the polymorphisms TLR2 (rs4696480 and rs1816702), TLR4 (rs1554973 and 
rs12377632), TLR9 (rs187084), TNFRSF1A (rs4149570), IL6R (rs4537545), IL10 
(rs3024505), IL23R (rs11209026) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) were associated with 
risk. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, both the homozygous and 
the heterozygous variant genotypes of IL23R G>A(rs11209026) (OR(CD,adj): 0.38, 
95% CI: 0.21-0.67, p = 0.03; OR(IBD,adj) 0.43, 95% CI: 0.28-0.67, p = 0.007) and 
PTPN22 1858 G>A(rs2476601) (OR(CD,unadj) 0.54, 95% CI: 0.41-0.72, p = 7*10-4; 
OR(IBD,unadj): 0.61, 95% CI: 0.48-0.77, p = 0.001) were associated with reduced 
risk of CD.
CONCLUSION: The biological effects of the studied polymorphisms suggest that 
genetically determined high inflammatory response was associated with increased 
risk of CD. The many SNPs found in TLRs suggest that the host microbial 
composition or environmental factors in the gut are involved in risk of IBD in 
genetically susceptible individuals.
