BACKGROUND: The genetic information contained in the genome of an organism is 
organized in genes and regulatory elements that control gene expression. The 
genomes of multiple plants species have already been sequenced and the gene 
repertory have been annotated, however, cis-regulatory elements remain less 
characterized, limiting our understanding of genome functionality. These 
elements act as open platforms for recruiting both positive- and negative-acting 
transcription factors, and as such, chromatin accessibility is an important 
signature for their identification.
RESULTS: In this work we developed a transgenic INTACT [isolation of nuclei 
tagged in specific cell types] system in tetraploid wheat for nuclei 
purifications. Then, we combined the INTACT system together with the assay for 
transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing [ATAC-seq] to identify open 
chromatin regions in wheat root tip samples. Our ATAC-seq results showed a large 
enrichment of open chromatin regions in intergenic and promoter regions, which 
is expected for regulatory elements and that is similar to ATAC-seq results 
obtained in other plant species. In addition, root ATAC-seq peaks showed a 
significant overlap with a previously published ATAC-seq data from wheat leaf 
protoplast, indicating a high reproducibility between the two experiments and a 
large overlap between open chromatin regions in root and leaf tissues. 
Importantly, we observed overlap between ATAC-seq peaks and cis-regulatory 
elements that have been functionally validated in wheat, and a good correlation 
between normalized accessibility and gene expression levels.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated an INTACT system in tetraploid 
wheat that allows rapid and high-quality nuclei purification from root tips. 
Those nuclei were successfully used to performed ATAC-seq experiments that 
revealed open chromatin regions in the wheat genome that will be useful to 
identify cis-regulatory elements. The INTACT system presented here will 
facilitate the development of ATAC-seq datasets in other tissues, growth stages, 
and under different growing conditions to generate a more complete landscape of 
the accessible DNA regions in the wheat genome.
