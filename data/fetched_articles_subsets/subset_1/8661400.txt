The monoclonal antibody 2D5 neutralized vaccinia virus by preventing penetration 
of the virus and reacting with VP23-29K. The conformation of the VP23-29K was 
maintained by a disulfide bond(s), and the 2D5mAb reacted stronger with the 
nonreduced 23-kDa form than with the reduced 29-kDa form. We selected several 
escape mutants. Sequences of the A17L genes, which were thought to encode the 
VP23-29K, did not show cognate mutation. Genomic DNA of a 2D5mAb-resistant 
mutant (M4) was cleaved with HindIII, and all the fragments were introduced into 
parental IHD-J strain vaccinia virus by transfection. Only the L fragment 
produced a 2D5mAb-resistant virus. Dissection of the L fragment and subsequent 
transfection revealed that the L1R gene induced the 2D5mAb-resistant virus. The 
2D5mAb-resistant mutants showed a consensus G to A conversion at nucleotide 101 
of their LIRs which would replace asparatic acid 35 with asparagine. 
Ishibashi-111 strain mousepox virus spontaneously resistant to 2D5mAb also had 
the same sequence at this region. Moreover, the VP23-29K was myristoylated as 
predicted by the L1R gene. The coding gene of the VP23-29K was L1R.
