Streptococcus suis is an important cause of meningitis, arthritis, and sudden 
death in young piglets and of meningitis in humans. A novel temperate S. 
suis-specific bacteriophage (ϕNJ2) was identified. The phage was induced from 
the S. suis strain NJ2 by using mitomycin C, and the whole genome sequence was 
determined. The ϕNJ2 genome is 37,282 bp in length and contains 56 open reading 
frames (ORFs). While 31 ORFs (55%) encoded hypothetical proteins, other ORFs 
were predicted to be functional, clearly indicating the novelty of ϕNJ2.
