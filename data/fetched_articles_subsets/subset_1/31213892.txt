Background: Patients with multiple brain metastases (BMs) from malignant 
melanoma have a poor prognosis. Recent developments in radiation techniques 
allow simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) concepts while sparing organs at risk. 
Data on conventional versus dose-escalated radiation approaches in multiple BMs 
from malignant melanoma are warranted. Methods: In this prospective, 
single-center, randomized two-armed study (trial ID: DRKS00005127), patients 
with multiple BMs from malignant melanoma were treated with either conventional 
whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) applying 30 Gy in 10 fractions (standard arm) or 
helical tomotherapy applying 30 Gy to the whole brain with an integrated boost 
to metastases of 50 Gy in 10 fractions and sparing of the hippocampus (HA-WBRT, 
experimental arm). The primary endpoint was treatment-related toxicity, while 
secondary endpoints were imaging response, intracerebral progression-free 
survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and quality of life. Results: The study 
was stopped early due to slow patient recruitment. A total number of 7 patients 
were enrolled (standard arm n=3, experimental arm n=4), and were followed-up for 
a median time of 5 months between August 2013 and July 2017. All patients were 
treated according to protocol. The median OS, intracerebral PFS and follow-up 
time were 5 months, 2 months and 5 months, respectively. The local control in 
every individual BM was significantly longer in the experimental versus the 
standard arm. No patient developed radiation-related high-grade toxicities. 
Conclusion: HA-WBRT with SIB results in improved local control in the individual 
melanoma BMs without radiation-associated high-grade toxicities. Survival times 
were comparable to published data.
