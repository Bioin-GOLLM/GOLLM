The post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins by O-linked 
Î²-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) is widespread across the proteome 
during the lifespan of all multicellular organisms. However, nearly all 
functional studies have focused on individual protein modifications, overlooking 
the multitude of simultaneous O-GlcNAcylation events that work together to 
coordinate cellular activities. Here, we describe Networking of Interactors and 
SubstratEs (NISE), a novel, systems-level approach to rapidly and 
comprehensively monitor O-GlcNAcylation across the proteome. Our method 
integrates affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and site-specific 
chemoproteomic technologies with network generation and unsupervised 
partitioning to connect potential upstream regulators with downstream targets of 
O-GlcNAcylation. The resulting network provides a data-rich framework that 
reveals both conserved activities of O-GlcNAcylation such as epigenetic 
regulation as well as tissue-specific functions like synaptic morphology. Beyond 
O-GlcNAc, this holistic and unbiased systems-level approach provides a broadly 
applicable framework to study PTMs and discover their diverse roles in specific 
cell types and biological states.
