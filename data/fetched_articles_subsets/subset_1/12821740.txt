OBJECTIVES: SCN1A mutations were recently reported in several patients with 
severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI). The authors analyzed SCN1A 
mutations in 93 patients with SMEI and made genotype-phenotype correlation to 
clarify the role of this gene in the etiology of SMEI.
METHODS: All patients fulfilled the criteria for SMEI. The authors analyzed all 
patients for SCN1A mutations using denaturing high performance liquid 
chromatography. If a patient's chromatogram was abnormal, the authors sequenced 
the gene in the patient and both parents.
RESULTS: SCN1A mutations were identified in 33 patients (35%). Most mutations 
were de novo, but were inherited in three patients. Parents carrying the 
inherited mutations had either no symptoms or a milder form of epilepsy. A 
greater frequency of unilateral motor seizures was the only clinical difference 
between patients with SCN1A mutations and those without. Truncating mutations 
were more frequently associated with such seizures than were missense mutations. 
The percentage of cases with family history of epilepsy was significantly higher 
in patients with SCN1A mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral motor seizures may be a specific clinical characteristic 
of SMEI caused by SCN1A mutations. Ten percent of SCN1A mutations are inherited 
from an asymptomatic or mildly affected parent, suggesting that SMEI is 
genetically heterogeneous. The increased frequency of familial epilepsy 
indicates that other genetic factors may contribute to this disorder.
