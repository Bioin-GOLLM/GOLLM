Infiltration of immune cells into CNS is one of the essential events in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) development. Adhesion molecules like the intercellular adhesion 
molecule 1 (ICAM-1) play critical role in this process. Therefore, the ICAM1 
gene containing two important single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belongs to 
candidate loci with possible involvement in MS susceptibility and/or severity. 
The objective of our case-control study was to analyze the association of two 
functional ICAM1 polymorphisms rs1799969 (or G241R) and rs5498 (or K469E) with 
susceptibility to MS and evaluate their influence on the age at disease onset, 
severity, neurological disability and progression rate. Two hundred forty-eight 
MS subjects (mean 39.2 years) and 208 age-matched controls (mean 35.6 years) 
were involved in the study. Genotyping of ICAM1 rs1799969 and rs5498 SNPs was 
performed by PCR-RFLP. Presence of the rs3135388 polymorphism tagging the major 
MS risk allele HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele was determined as well. Our analysis 
revealed no statistically significant association of ICAM1 polymorphisms with 
risk of MS development in the Slovak population. Stratification of study cohorts 
by gender, age at onset and presence of the HLA-DRB1*15:01 risk allele showed 
only moderate changes. Correlation of clinical findings as age at onset, Kurtzke 
Expanded Disability Status Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score and 
progression index with ICAM1 genotypes in MS patients revealed no significant 
association; however, patients with earlier onset of MS showed slightly higher 
frequencies of the homozygous G allele at rs5498 in comparison to other 
genotypes (P = 0.04), suggesting that GG carriers tend to induce MS at an 
earlier age.
