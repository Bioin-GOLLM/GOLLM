BACKGROUND: Although several novel agents are currently in clinical trials for 
eosinophilic disorders, none has demonstrated efficacy in reducing blood and 
tissue eosinophilia in all subjects. Additional approaches are clearly needed.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore the potential of the human eosinophil surface 
receptor epidermal growth factor-like module containing mucin-like hormone 
receptor 1 (EMR1) as a therapeutic target for eosinophilic disorders.
METHODS: EMR1 expression was assessed in blood and bone marrow specimens from 
eosinophilic and healthy subjects, cell lines, CD34(+) cells differentiated in 
vitro, and tissue biopsy specimens by using flow cytometry, quantitative PCR, 
and immunostaining. Eosinophil targeting by a novel, humanized, afucosylated 
anti-EMR1 IgG1 was evaluated in vitro by using a natural killer cell-mediated 
killing assay and in vivo in cynomolgus monkeys.
RESULTS: Analysis of blood and bone marrow cells from healthy and eosinophilic 
donors and in vitro-differentiated CD34(+) cells confirmed restriction of human 
EMR1 surface and mRNA expression to mature eosinophils. Tissue eosinophils also 
expressed EMR1. Although EMR1 was highly expressed on eosinophils from all 
subjects, surface expression was negatively correlated with absolute eosinophil 
counts (r = -0.46, P < .001), and soluble plasma levels correlated positively 
with absolute eosinophil counts (r = 0.69, P < .001), suggesting modulation of 
EMR1 in vivo. Nevertheless, afucosylated anti-EMR1 mAb dramatically enhanced 
natural killer cell-mediated killing of eosinophils from healthy and 
eosinophilic donors and induced a rapid and sustained depletion of eosinophils 
in monkeys.
CONCLUSION: EMR1 expression is restricted to mature blood and tissue 
eosinophils. Targeting of eosinophils with afucosylated anti-EMR1 antibody shows 
promise as a treatment for eosinophilic disorders.
