The dependency of cancer cells on glutamine may be exploited therapeutically as 
a new strategy for treating cancers that lack druggable driver genes. Here we 
found that human liver cancer was dependent on extracellular glutamine. However, 
targeting glutamine addiction using the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 as 
monotherapy had a very limited anticancer effect, even against the most 
glutamine addicted human liver cancer cells. Using a chemical library, we 
identified V-9302, a novel inhibitor of glutamine transporter ASCT2, as 
sensitizing glutamine dependent (GD) cells to CB-839 treatment. Mechanically, a 
combination of CB-839 and V-9302 depleted glutathione and induced reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), resulting in apoptosis of GD cells. Moreover, this 
combination also showed tumor inhibition in HCC xenograft mouse models in vivo. 
Our findings indicate that dual inhibition of glutamine metabolism by targeting 
both glutaminase and glutamine transporter ASCT2 represents a potential novel 
treatment strategy for glutamine addicted liver cancers.
