A 30-year-old lady was admitted to the hospital with progressive exertional 
dyspnoea and bradycardia. A complete atrioventricular block was diagnosed using 
12‑lead electrocardiography and a transthoracic echocardiography revealed a 
severely impaired left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection 
fraction of 20%. Following hospitalization, her coronary angiography was normal, 
so a whole exome sequencing was conducted. The novel Lamin A/C Gene missense 
mutation c.263C > A,p.Ala88Asp in exon 3 was identified. A CRT-D was implanted 
due to the high risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and low 
potential for left ventricular reverse remodelling. The patient is undergoing 
follow-ups at the outpatient clinic, showing a 25% improvement in left 
ventricular ejection fraction during the last visit.
