Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heritable, genetically 
heterogeneous disorder with variable age-dependent penetrance. We sought to 
identify the genetic underpinnings of syndromic, sporadic DCM in a newborn 
female diagnosed in utero. Postnatal evaluation revealed ventricular dilation 
and systolic dysfunction, bilateral cataracts, and mild facial dysmorphisms. 
Comprehensive metabolic and genetic testing, including chromosomal microarray, 
mitochondrial DNA and targeted RASopathy gene sequencing, and clinical whole 
exome sequencing for known cardiomyopathy genes was non-diagnostic. Following 
exclusion of asymptomatic DCM in the parents, trio-based whole exome sequencing 
was carried out on a research basis, filtering for rare, predicted deleterious 
de novo and recessive variants. An unreported de novo S75Y mutation was 
discovered in RRAGC, encoding Ras-related GTP binding C, an essential GTPase in 
nutrient-activated mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. 
In silico protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulation predicted the 
mutation to disrupt ligand interactions and increase the GDP-bound state. 
Overexpression of RagC(S75Y) rendered AD293 cells partially insensitive to amino 
acid deprivation, resulting in increased mTORC1 signaling compared to wild-type 
RagC. These findings implicate mTORC1 dysregulation through a gain-of-function 
mutation in RagC as a novel molecular basis for syndromic forms of pediatric 
heart failure, and expand genotype-phenotype correlation in RASopathy-related 
syndromes.
