Amplification or overexpression of MYCN is associated with poor prognosis of 
human neuroblastoma. We have recently defined a MYCN-dependent transcriptional 
signature, including protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which 
identifies a subgroup of patients with high-risk disease. Here we provide 
several lines of evidence demonstrating PRMT1 as a novel regulator of MYCN and 
implicating PRMT1 as a potential therapeutic target in neuroblastoma 
pathogenesis. First, we observed a strong correlation between MYCN and PRMT1 
protein levels in primary neuroblastoma tumors. Second, MYCN physically 
associates with PRMT1 by direct protein-protein interaction. Third, depletion of 
PRMT1 through siRNA knockdown reduced neuroblastoma cell viability and MYCN 
expression. Fourth, we showed that PRMT1 regulates MYCN stability and identified 
MYCN as a novel substrate of PRMT1. Finally, we demonstrated that mutation of 
putatively methylated arginine R65 to alanine decreased MYCN stability by 
altering phosphorylation at residues serine 62 and threonine 58. These results 
provide mechanistic insights into the modulation of MYCN oncoprotein by PRMT1, 
and suggest that targeting PRMT1 may have a therapeutic impact on MYCN-driven 
oncogenesis.
