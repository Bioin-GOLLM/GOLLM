INTRODUCTION: Activation of inflammation and coagulation was closely related and 
mutually interdependent in sepsis. Tissue factor (TF) and its endogenous 
inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) was the main regulators of the 
initiation of coagulation process. Altered plasma levels of TF and TFPI have 
been related to worse outcome in sepsis. The objective of this study was to 
investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TF and TFPI 
genes were associated with risk and outcome for patients with severe sepsis.
METHODS: Seventeen SNPs in TF and TFPI were genotyped in samples of sepsis (n 
=577) and severe sepsis patients (n =476), and tested for association in this 
case-control collection. We then investigated correlation between the associated 
SNPs and the mRNA expression, and protein level of the corresponding gene. The 
mRNA levels of TF were determined using real-time quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the soluble plasma levels of TF were 
measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.
RESULTS: Association analysis revealed that three TF SNPs in perfect linkage 
disequilibrium, rs1361600, rs3917615 and rs958587, were significantly associated 
with outcome of severe sepsis. G allele frequency of rs1361600 in survivor 
patients was significantly higher than that in nonsurvivor severe sepsis 
patients (P =4.91 Ã— 10(-5), odds ratio (OR) =0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
0.33 to 0.69). The association remained significant after adjustment for 
covariates in multiple logistic regression analysis and for multiple 
comparisons. Lipopolysaccharide-induced TF-mRNA expression levels in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells from subjects carrying rs1361600 AG and GG genotypes, 
were significantly lower than those subjects carrying AA genotype (P =0.0012). 
Moreover, severe sepsis patients of GG and GA genotypes showed lower serum 
levels of TF than patients with AA genotype (P adj =0.02). The plasma levels of 
TF were also associated with outcome of severe sepsis patients (P adj =0.01). 
However, genotype and allele analyses did not show any significant difference 
between sepsis and severe sepsis patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that common genetic variation in TF was 
significantly associated with outcome of severe sepsis in Chinese Han 
population.
