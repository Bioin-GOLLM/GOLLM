Chrysanthemum stunt viroid (CSVd) was inoculated into two chrysanthemum 
(Chrysanthemum morifolium) cultivars, the CSVd-susceptible cultivar Piato and 
the CSVd-resistant cultivar Mari Kazaguruma. For CSVd inoculation, grafting and 
Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation were used. In grafting experiments, CSVd was 
detectable in Mari Kazaguruma after grafting onto infected Piato, but after 
removal of infected rootstocks, CSVd could not be detected in the uppermost 
leaves. In agroinfection experiments, CSVd systemic infection was observed in 
Piato but not in Mari Kazaguruma. However, agro-inoculated leaves of Mari 
Kazaguruma accumulated circular CSVd RNA to levels equivalent to those in Piato 
at 7 days post-inoculation. In situ detection of CSVd in inoculated leaves 
revealed that CSVd was absent in phloem of Mari Kazaguruma, while CSVd strongly 
localized to this site in Piato. We hypothesize that CSVd resistance in Mari 
Kazaguruma relates not to CSVd replication but to CSVd movement in leaves.
