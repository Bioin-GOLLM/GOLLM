Bacteriophage are abundant at sites of bacterial infection, but their effects on 
mammalian hosts are unclear. We have identified pathogenic roles for filamentous 
Pf bacteriophage produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) in suppression of 
immunity against bacterial infection. Pf promote Pa wound infection in mice and 
are associated with chronic human Pa wound infections. Murine and human 
leukocytes endocytose Pf, and internalization of this single-stranded DNA virus 
results in phage RNA production. This triggers Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and 
TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent type I 
interferon production, inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and the 
suppression of phagocytosis. Conversely, immunization of mice against Pf 
prevents Pa wound infection. Thus, Pf triggers maladaptive innate viral 
pattern-recognition responses, which impair bacterial clearance. Vaccination 
against phage virions represents a potential strategy to prevent bacterial 
infection.
