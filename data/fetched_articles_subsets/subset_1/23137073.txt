OBJECTIVE: To characterize patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) with 
and without AA amyloidosis living in Germany.
METHOD: Clinical and genetic data from 64 FMF patients were analysed for 
amyloidosis risk factors.
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (85%) were of Turkish or Armenian origin. 
Thirty-one patients (48%) developed FMF symptoms before the age of 16 years. 
Sixteen patients (26%) became symptomatic after age 20. Symptoms reported were 
peritonitis (95%), fever (78%), pleuritis (59%), arthralgia (60%), arthritis 
(32%), erysipelas-like erythema (23%), and vasculitis (8%). FMF diagnosis was 
delayed for a median of 8.0 years. Genetic analysis confirmed M694V as the most 
prevalent Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene mutation in 46 out of 59 patients 
(78%). M694V homozygosity was associated with an earlier FMF onset (median age 
5.5 years, p = 0.0001) and a higher prevalence of peritonitis (p = 0.007) and 
pleuritis (p = 0.0007) compared to patients without an M694V mutation. AA 
amyloidosis was detected in 16 patients (25%) at a median age of 36.5 years and 
tended to be associated with a higher age at disease onset (p = 0.062) and a 
higher FMF activity score (p = 0.093). AA amyloidosis was significantly 
associated with a higher age at FMF diagnosis (p = 0.0022).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical symptoms of FMF-affected migrants living in Germany 
resemble those observed in their home country. In particular, patients with an 
onset of FMF symptoms after age 20 and a later FMF diagnosis have a high risk of 
AA amyloidosis. Symptomatic patients who originate from countries with a higher 
FMF prevalence should be screened for FMF and proteinuria.
