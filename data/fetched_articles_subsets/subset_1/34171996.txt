BACKGROUND: Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission and neuropeptide levels play 
a central role in migraine pathomechanism. Previously, we confirmed that 
kynurenic acid, an endogenous glutamatergic antagonist, was able to decrease the 
expression of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 1-38, a 
neuropeptide with known migraine-inducing properties. Hence, our aim was to 
reveal the role of the peripheral kynurenine pathway (KP) in episodic 
migraineurs. We focused on the complete tryptophan (Trp) catabolism, which 
comprises the serotonin and melatonin routes in addition to kynurenine 
metabolites. We investigated the relationship between metabolic alterations and 
clinical characteristics of migraine patients.
METHODS: Female migraine patients aged between 25 and 50 years (n = 50) and 
healthy control subjects (n = 34) participated in this study. Blood samples were 
collected from the cubital veins of subjects (during both the interictal/ictal 
periods in migraineurs, n = 47/12, respectively). 12 metabolites of Trp pathway 
were determined by neurochemical measurements (UHPLC-MS/MS).
RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of the most Trp metabolites were remarkably 
decreased in the interictal period of migraineurs compared to healthy control 
subjects, especially in the migraine without aura (MWoA) subgroup: Trp 
(p < 0.025), L-kynurenine (p < 0.001), kynurenic acid (p < 0.016), anthranilic 
acid (p < 0.007), picolinic acid (p < 0.03), 5-hydroxy-indoleaceticacid 
(p < 0.025) and melatonin (p < 0.023). Several metabolites showed a tendency to 
elevate during the ictal phase, but this was significant only in the cases of 
anthranilic acid, 5-hydroxy-indoleaceticacid and melatonin in MWoA patients. In 
the same subgroup, higher interictal kynurenic acid levels were identified in 
patients whose headache was severe and not related to their menstruation cycle. 
Negative linear correlation was detected between the interictal levels of 
xanthurenic acid/melatonin and attack frequency. Positive associations were 
found between the ictal 3-hydroxykynurenine levels and the beginning of attacks, 
just as between ictal picolinic acid levels and last attack before ictal 
sampling.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there is a widespread metabolic imbalance 
in migraineurs, which manifests in a completely depressed peripheral Trp 
catabolism during the interictal period. It might act as trigger for the 
migraine attack, contributing to glutamate excess induced neurotoxicity and 
generalised hyperexcitability. This data can draw attention to the clinical 
relevance of KP in migraine.
