While many genetic causes of movement disorders have been identified, modifiers 
of disease expression are largely unknown. X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) 
is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)n 
retrotransposon insertion in TAF1, with a polymorphic (AGAGGG)n repeat. Repeat 
length and variants in MSH3 and PMS2 explain ∼65% of the variance in age at 
onset (AAO) in XDP. However, additional genetic modifiers are conceivably at 
play in XDP, such as repeat interruptions. Long-read nanopore sequencing of PCR 
amplicons from XDP patients (n = 202) was performed to assess potential repeat 
interruption and instability. Repeat-primed PCR and Cas9-mediated targeted 
enrichment confirmed the presence of identified divergent repeat motifs. In 
addition to the canonical pure SINE-VNTR-Alu-5'-(AGAGGG)n, we observed a mosaic 
of divergent repeat motifs that polarized at the beginning of the tract, where 
the divergent repeat interruptions varied in motif length by having one, two, or 
three nucleotides fewer than the hexameric motif, distinct from interruptions in 
other disease-associated repeats, which match the lengths of the canonical 
motifs. All divergent configurations occurred mosaically and in two investigated 
brain regions (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and in blood-derived DNA from the same 
patient. The most common divergent interruption was AGG 
[5'-SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)2AGG(AGAGGG)n], similar to the pure tract, followed by 
AGGG [5'-SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)2AGGG(AGAGGG)n], at median frequencies of 0.425 
(IQR: 0.42-0.43) and 0.128 (IQR: 0.12-0.13), respectively. The mosaic AGG motif 
was not associated with repeat number (estimate = -3.8342, P = 0.869). The 
mosaic pure tract frequency was associated with repeat number (estimate = 45.32, 
P = 0.0441) but not AAO (estimate = -41.486, P = 0.378). Importantly, the mosaic 
frequency of the AGGG negatively correlated with repeat number after adjusting 
for age at sampling (estimate = -161.09, P = 3.44 × 10-5). When including the 
XDP-relevant MSH3/PMS2 modifier single nucleotide polymorphisms into the model, 
the mosaic AGGG frequency was associated with AAO (estimate = 155.1063, P = 
0.047); however, the association dissipated after including the repeat number 
(estimate = -92.46430, P = 0.079). We reveal novel mosaic divergent repeat 
interruptions affecting both motif length and sequence (DRILS) of the canonical 
motif polarized within the SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)n repeat. Our study illustrates: 
(i) the importance of somatic mosaic genotypes; (ii) the biological plausibility 
of multiple modifiers (both germline and somatic) that can have additive effects 
on repeat instability; and (iii) that these variations may remain undetected 
without assessment of single molecules.
