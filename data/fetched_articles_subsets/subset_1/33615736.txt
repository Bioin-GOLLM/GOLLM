Heterotrimeric G proteins are classified into four subfamilies and play a key 
role in signal transduction. They transmit extracellular signals to 
intracellular effectors subsequent to the activation of G protein-coupled 
receptors (GPCRs), which are targeted by over 30 % of FDA-approved drugs. 
However, addressing G proteins as drug targets represents a compelling 
alternative, for example, when G proteins act independently of the corresponding 
GPCRs, or in cases of complex multifunctional diseases, when a large number of 
different GPCRs are involved. In contrast to Gαq, efforts to target Gαi/s by 
suitable chemical compounds has not been successful so far. Here, a 
comprehensive analysis was conducted examining the most important interface 
regions of Gαi/s with its upstream and downstream interaction partners. By 
assigning the existing compounds and the performed approaches to the respective 
interfaces, the druggability of the individual interfaces was ranked to provide 
perspectives for selective targeting of Gαi/s in the future.
