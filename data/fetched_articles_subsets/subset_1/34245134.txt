BACKGROUND: With the rapid influx of novel anti-cancer agents, phase I clinical 
trials in oncology are evolving. Historically, response rates on early phase 
trials have been modest with the clinical benefit and ethics of enrolment 
debated. However, there is a paucity of real-world data in this setting.
AIM: To better understand the changing landscape of phase I oncology trials, we 
performed a retrospective review at our institution to examine patient and trial 
characteristics, screening outcomes, and treatment outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed all consecutive adult patients with advanced 
solid organ malignancies who were screened across phase I trials from January 
2013 to December 2018 at a single institution. During this period, 242 patients 
were assessed for 28 different trials. Median age was 64 years (range 30-89) 
with an equal sex distribution. Among 257 screening visits, the overall screen 
failure rate was 18%, resulting in 212 patients being enrolled onto a study. 
Twenty-six trials (93%) involved immunotherapeutic agents or molecular targeted 
agents either alone or in combination, with only two trials of cytotoxic agents 
(7%). Twenty-two (13.4%) of the 209 treated patients experienced a total of 33 
grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events. There was one 
treatment-related death (0.5%). Of 190 response-evaluable patients, 7 (4%) had a 
complete response, 34 (18%) a partial response, and 59 (31%) experienced stable 
disease for a disease control rate of 53%. The median overall survival for our 
cohort was 8.0 (95% CI: 6.8-9.2) months.
CONCLUSION: The profile of phase I trials at our institution are consistent with 
the changing early drug development landscape. Response rates and overall 
survival in our cohort are superior to historically reported rates and 
comparable to contemporaneous studies. Severe treatment-related toxicity was 
relatively uncommon, and treatment-related mortality was rare.
