We report on a family in which nonsyndromal mild to moderate mental retardation 
segregates as an X-linked trait (MRX41). Two point linkage analysis demonstrated 
linkage between the disorder and marker DXS3 in Xq21.33 with a lod score of 2.56 
at theta = 0.0 and marker DXS1108 in Xq28 with a lod score of 3.82 at theta = 
0.0. Multipoint linkage analysis showed that the odds for a location of the gene 
in Xq28 vs Xq21.33 are 100:1. This is the fourth family with non-specific 
X-linked mental retardation with Xq28-qter as the most likely gene localization.
