In retinitis pigmentosa, loss of cone photoreceptors leads to blindness, and 
preservation of cone function is a major therapeutic goal. However, cone loss is 
thought to occur as a secondary event resulting from degeneration of rod 
photoreceptors. Here we report a genome editing approach in which 
adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 delivery to postmitotic 
photoreceptors is used to target the Nrl gene, encoding for Neural 
retina-specific leucine zipper protein, a rod fate determinant during 
photoreceptor development. Following Nrl disruption, rods gain partial features 
of cones and present with improved survival in the presence of mutations in 
rod-specific genes, consequently preventing secondary cone degeneration. In 
three different mouse models of retinal degeneration, the treatment 
substantially improves rod survival and preserves cone function. Our data 
suggest that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NRL disruption in rods may be a promising 
treatment option for patients with retinitis pigmentosa.
