Brain spheroids or organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) 
are still not capable of completely recapitulating in vivo human brain tissue, 
and one of the limitations is lack of microglia. To add built-in immune 
function, coculture of the dorsal forebrain spheroids with isogenic 
microglia-like cells (D-MG) was performed in our study. The three-dimensional 
D-MG spheroids were analyzed for their transcriptome and compared with isogenic 
microglia-like cells (MG). Cortical spheroids containing microglia-like cells 
displayed different metabolic programming, which may affect the associated 
phenotype. The expression of genes related to glycolysis and hypoxia signaling 
was increased in cocultured D-MG spheroids, indicating the metabolic shift to 
aerobic glycolysis, which is in favor of M1 polarization of microglia-like 
cells. In addition, the metabolic pathways and the signaling pathways involved 
in cell proliferation, cell death, PIK3/AKT/mTOR signaling, eukaryotic 
initiation factor 2 pathway, and Wnt and Notch pathways were analyzed. The 
results demonstrate the activation of mTOR and p53 signaling, increased 
expression of Notch ligands, and the repression of NF-κB and canonical Wnt 
pathways, as well as the lower expression of cell cycle genes in the cocultured 
D-MG spheroids. This analysis indicates that physiological 3-D microenvironment 
may reshape the immunity of in vitro cortical spheroids and better recapitulate 
in vivo brain tissue function for disease modeling and drug screening.
