BACKGROUND: Progeria-like syndromes offer a unique insight into aging. Here the 
case of a boy affected with mandibuloacral dysplasia and compound heterozygous 
mutations in ZMPSTE24 is presented.
METHODS: Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectroscopy is used for proteome 
analysis to analyze peptides previously found to be differentially regulated in 
chronic kidney disease (273 peptides defining the CKD273 classifier), coronary 
artery disease (238 peptides defining the CAD238 classifier), and aging (116 
peptides defining the AGE116 classifier).
RESULTS: No evidence of renal disease is identified. Although the boy has no 
overt cardiovascular disease other than a raised carotid intima media thickness 
relative to his age, a proteomic classifier for the diagnosis of coronary artery 
disease is mildly raised. The biological age based on the proteomic AGE116 
classifier is 24 years compared to the chronological ages of 5 and 10 years. In 
contrast, a control group of healthy children has a significantly lower (p < 
0.0001) calculated mean age of 13.
CONCLUSION: Urinary proteomic analysis is effective in confirming advanced 
biological age and to identify early evidence of renal or cardiovascular damage. 
This case highlights the value of proteomic approaches in aging research and may 
represent a method for non-invasive monitoring of the effects of early aging.
