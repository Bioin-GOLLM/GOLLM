Mutations in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most 
prevalent cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). The increase in LRRK2 
kinase activity observed in the pathogenic G2019S mutation is important for PD 
development. Several studies have reported that increased LRRK2 kinase activity 
and treatment with LRRK2 kinase inhibitors decreased and increased ciliogenesis, 
respectively, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and retinal pigment 
epithelium (RPE) cells. In contrast, treatment of SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neuronal 
cells with PD-causing chemicals increased ciliogenesis. Because these reports 
were somewhat contradictory, we tested the effect of LRRK2 kinase activity on 
ciliogenesis in neurons. In SH-SY5Y cells, LRRK2 inhibitor treatment slightly 
increased ciliogenesis, but serum starvation showed no increase. In rat primary 
neurons, LRRK2 inhibitor treatment repeatedly showed no significant change. 
Little difference was observed between primary cortical neurons prepared from 
wild-type (WT) and G2019S+/- mice. However, a significant increase in 
ciliogenesis was observed in G2019S+/- compared to WT human fibroblasts, and 
this pattern was maintained in neural stem cells (NSCs) differentiated from the 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) prepared from the same WT/G2019S 
fibroblast pair. NSCs differentiated from G2019S and its gene-corrected WT 
counterpart iPSCs were also used to test ciliogenesis in an isogenic background. 
The results showed no significant difference between WT and G2019S regardless of 
kinase inhibitor treatment and B27-deprivation-mimicking serum starvation. These 
results suggest that LRRK2 kinase activity may be not a direct regulator of 
ciliogenesis and ciliogenesis varies depending upon the cell type or genetic 
background.
