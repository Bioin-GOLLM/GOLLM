The in vivo incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins is a 
well-established technique requiring an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA 
synthetase pair specific for the unnatural amino acid that is incorporated at a 
position encoded by a TAG amber codon. Although this technology provides unique 
opportunities to engineer protein structures, poor protein yields are usually 
obtained in deuterated media, hampering its application in the protein NMR 
field. Here, we describe a novel protocol for incorporating unnatural amino 
acids into fully deuterated proteins using glucose-based media (which are 
relevant to the production, for example, of amino acid-specific methyl-labeled 
proteins used in the study of large molecular weight systems). The method 
consists of pre-induction of the pEVOL plasmid encoding the tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA 
synthetase pair in a rich, H(2)O-based medium prior to exchanging the culture 
into a D(2)O-based medium. Our protocol results in high level of isotopic 
incorporation (~95%) and retains the high expression level of the target protein 
observed in Luria-Bertani medium.
