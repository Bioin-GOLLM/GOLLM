NADPH oxidases (NOX) are enzyme complexes that have received much attention as 
key molecules in the development of vascular dysfunction. NOX have the primary 
function of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and are considered the 
main source of ROS production in endothelial cells. The endothelium is a thin 
monolayer that lines the inner surface of blood vessels, acting as a secretory 
organ to maintain homeostasis of blood flow. The enzymatic production of nitric 
oxide (NO) by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is critical in mediating 
endothelial function, and oxidative stress can cause dysregulation of eNOS and 
endothelial dysfunction. Insulin is a stimulus for increases in blood flow and 
endothelium-dependent vasodilation. However, cardiovascular disease and type 2 
diabetes are characterized by poor control of the endothelial cell redox 
environment, with a shift toward overproduction of ROS by NOX. Studies in models 
of type 2 diabetes demonstrate that aberrant NOX activation contributes to 
uncoupling of eNOS and endothelial dysfunction. It is well-established that 
endothelial dysfunction precedes the onset of cardiovascular disease, therefore 
NOX are important molecular links between type 2 diabetes and vascular 
complications. The aim of the current review is to describe the normal, healthy 
physiological mechanisms involved in endothelial function, and highlight the 
central role of NOX in mediating endothelial dysfunction when glucose 
homeostasis is impaired.
