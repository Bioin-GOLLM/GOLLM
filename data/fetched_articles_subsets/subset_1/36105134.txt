In nature, many biological tissues are composed of oriented structures, which 
endow tissues with special properties and functions. Although traditional 
hydrogels can achieve a high level of biomimetic composition, the orderly 
arrangement of internal structures remains a challenge. Therefore, it is of 
great significance to synthesize hydrogels with oriented structures easily and 
quickly. In this study, we first proposed and demonstrated a fabrication process 
for producing a well-ordered and dual-responsive cellulose nanofibers + 
hyaluronic acid methacrylate (CN+HAMA) hydrogels through an extrusion-based 
three-dimensional (3D) printing process. CN in the CN+HAMA hydrogels are 
directionally aligned after extrusion due to shear stress. In addition, the 
synthesized hydrogels exhibited responsive behaviors to both temperature and 
ultraviolet light. Since the temperature-responsiveness is reversible, the 
hydrogels can transit between the gelation and solution states while retaining 
their original qualities. Furthermore, the developed well-oriented CN+HAMA 
hydrogels induced directional cell growth, paving the way for potential 
applications in ordered biological soft-tissue repair.
