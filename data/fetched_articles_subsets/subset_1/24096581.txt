The associations between the Arg280His polymorphism in X-ray repair 
cross-complementing gene 1 (XRCC1 gene) and hematological malignancies have been 
extensively investigated. However, the results were inconsistent. The objective 
of the current study was to investigate the associations between the Arg280His 
polymorphism in XRCC1 gene and the risk of hematological malignancies by 
meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, and Weipu databases, 
covering all studies until 07 Aug 2013. Statistical analysis was performed by 
using the Revman4.2 software and the Stata10.0 software. A total of 2,650 cases 
and 3,856 controls in 12 case-control studies concerning the Arg280His 
polymorphism were included. The results suggested that the Arg280His 
polymorphism might not be associated with risk of hematological malignancies (OR 
= 1.08, 95%CI = 0.86-1.35, P = 0.50). In the subgroup analyses by cancer types 
and ethnicity, no significant associations were found among different cancers or 
different ethnicities. The current meta-analysis indicated that the Arg280His 
polymorphism in the XRCC1 gene might not be a risk factor for hematological 
malignancies. In future, more large-scale case-control studies are needed to 
validate these results.
