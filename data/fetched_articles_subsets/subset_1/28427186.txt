PURPOSE: This study investigated the expression and function of the microRNA-494 
in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD).
RESULTS: MicroRNA-494 expression was upregulated during IDD progression; its 
overexpression increased the expression of ECM catabolic factors such as matrix 
metalloproteinase and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin 
motif in NP cells while decreasing that of anabolic genes such as type II 
collagen and aggrecan; it also induced the apoptosis of NP cells, as determined 
by flow cytometry. These effects were reversed by microRNA-494 inhibitor 
treatment. SOX9 was identified as a target of negative regulation by 
microRNA-494. Promoter hypomethylation and NF-κB activation were associated with 
microRNA-494 upregulation in IDD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MicroRNA-494 expression in degenerative nucleus pulposus 
(NP) tissue was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. The effect of 
microRNA-494 on extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism and NP cell apoptosis was 
evaluated by transfection of microRNA-494 mimic or inhibitor. The regulation of 
SRY-related high mobility group box (SOX)9 expression by microRNA-494 was 
assessed with the luciferase reporter assay, and the methylation status of the 
microRNA-494 promoter was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite 
sequencing PCR. The role of activated nuclear factor (NF)-κB in the regulation 
of microRNA-494 expression was evaluated using specific inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNA-494 promotes ECM degradation and apoptosis of degenerative 
human NP cells by directly targeting SOX9.
