Infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) is a very rare disorder belonging to the 
heterozygous group of genetic fibromatosis. There is a diffuse deposition of 
hyaline material in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, muscle, lymph node, 
spleen, thyroid, and adrenal gland due to which it presents clinically with 
multiple subcutaneous skin nodules, gingival hypertrophy, osteopenia, joint 
contractures, failure to thrive, and diarrhea with protein-losing enteropathy, 
and is associated with recurrent infections. The disease is caused by mutations 
in ANTXR2 also known as the CMG2 gene, which encodes the 
transmembrane-extracellular matrix assembly. In this report, we describe a 
nine-month-old male diagnosed with ISH based on the clinical presentation of 
severe skin lesions, painful joint contractures, diarrhea, and failure to 
thrive. His diagnosis was confirmed by molecular DNA sequencing of the ANTXR2 
gene. Consanguinity and molecular diagnosis will be helpful for early diagnosis 
and accurate management.
