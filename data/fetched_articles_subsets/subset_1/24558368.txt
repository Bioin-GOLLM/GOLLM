As a major product of extracellular matrix (ECM), Hyaluronic acid (HA) is 
involved in early cardiac development and mainly synthesized by Hyaluronan 
synthase 2 (HAS2) during embryogenesis. Targeted deletion of HAS2 gene in mice 
led to obvious cardiac and vascular defects. To clarify the potential 
association of the mutation in HAS2 with the development of congenital heart 
disease (CHD), in this study, we sequenced the coding region of HAS2 and 
identified a novel non-synonymous variant c.A1496T (p.Glu499Val) in one of 100 
non-syndromic Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) patients. The variant was not 
observed in 250 controls. In addition, to determine the contribution of HAS2 
variant in VSD, we compared HA content in supernatant using HA quantitative 
analysis and found that the mutation obviously affected the HA synthetic 
activity of HAS2. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the mutation in 
HAS2 was found in Chinese VSD patients, which suggested that HAS2 may be 
involved in the etiology of non-syndromic VSD and have the vital function in the 
development of heart septum.
