Patients with laryngeal disorders may have severe morbidity relating to 
swallowing, vocalization, and respiratory function, for which conventional 
therapies are suboptimal. A tissue-engineered approach would aim to restore the 
vocal folds and maintain respiratory function while limiting the extent of 
scarring in the regenerated tissue. Under Good Laboratory Practice conditions, 
we decellularized porcine larynges, using detergents and enzymes under negative 
pressure to produce an acellular scaffold comprising cartilage, muscle, and 
mucosa. To assess safety and functionality before clinical trials, a 
decellularized hemilarynx seeded with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem 
cells and a tissue-engineered oral mucosal sheet was implanted orthotopically 
into six pigs. The seeded grafts were left in situ for 6 months and assessed 
using computed tomography imaging, bronchoscopy, and mucosal brushings, together 
with vocal recording and histological analysis on explantation. The graft caused 
no adverse respiratory function, nor did it impact swallowing or vocalization. 
Rudimentary vocal folds covered by contiguous epithelium were easily 
identifiable. In conclusion, the proposed tissue-engineered approach represents 
a viable alternative treatment for laryngeal defects. Stem Cells Translational
