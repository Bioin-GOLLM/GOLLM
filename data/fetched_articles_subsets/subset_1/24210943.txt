Maternal care involves the consistent and coordinated expression of a variety of 
behaviours over an extended period of time, and adverse changes in maternal care 
can have profound impacts on the CNS and behaviour of offspring. This complex 
behavioural pattern depends on a number of integrated neuroendocrine mechanisms. 
This review will discuss the use of animal models in the study of the role of 
maternal care in shaping CNS function, the contributions of corticosteroid 
releasing hormone, vasopressin, oxytocin, and prolactin in this process, the 
molecular mechanisms involved, and the translational relevance of this research.
