Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with motor and non-motor symptoms and 
characterized by aggregates of alpha-synuclein (αSyn). Naturally occurring 
antibodies (nAbs) are part of the innate immune system, produced without prior 
contact to their specific antigen, and polyreactive. The abundance of nAbs 
against αSyn is altered in patients with PD. In this work, we biophysically 
characterized nAbs against αSyn (nAbs-αSyn) and determined their biological 
effects. nAbs-αSyn were isolated from commercial intravenous immunoglobulins 
using column affinity purification. Biophysical properties were characterized 
using a battery of established in vitro assays. Biological effects were 
characterized in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with fluorescently tagged 
αSyn. Specific binding of nAbs-αSyn to monomeric αSyn was demonstrated by Dot 
blot, ELISA, and Surface Plasmon Resonance. nAbs-αSyn did not affect viability 
of HEK293T cells as reported by Cell Titer Blue and LDH Assays. nAbs-αSyn 
inhibited fibrillation of αSyn reported by the Thioflavin T aggregation assay. 
Altered fibril formation was confirmed with atomic force microscopy. In cells 
transfected with EGFP-tagged αSyn we observed reduced formation of aggresomes, 
perinuclear accumulations of αSyn aggregates. The results demonstrate that serum 
of healthy individuals contains nAbs that specifically bind αSyn and inhibit 
aggregation of αSyn in vitro. The addition of nAbs-αSyn to cultured cells 
affects intracellular αSyn aggregates. These findings help understanding the 
role of the innate immune systems for the pathogenesis of PD and suggest that 
systemic αSyn binding agents could potentially affect neuronal αSyn pathology.
