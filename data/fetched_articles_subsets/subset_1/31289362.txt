Despite the existence of many clinical and molecular factors reported that 
contribute to survival in glioblastoma, prevailing studies fell into partial or 
local feature selection for survival analysis. We proposed a feature selection 
strategy including not only joint covariate detection but also its evaluations, 
and performed it on miRNA expression profiles with glioblastoma. MiR-10b and 
miR-222 were selected as the most significant two-dimensional feature. 
Crucially, we integrated in vitro experiments on GBM cells and in vivo studies 
on a mouse model of human glioma to elucidate the synergistic effects between 
miR-10b and miR-222. Inhibition of miR-10b and miR-222 strongly suppress GBM 
cells growth, invasion, and induce apoptosis by co-targeting PTEN and leading to 
activation of p53 ultimately. We also demonstrated that miR-10b and miR-222 
co-target BIM to induce apoptosis independent of p53 status. The results define 
mir-10b and mir-222 important roles in gliomagenesis and provided a reliable 
survival analysis strategy.
