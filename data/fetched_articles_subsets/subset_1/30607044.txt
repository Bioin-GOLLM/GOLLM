Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy is a rare autosomal recessive 
disease, characterized by hypotrichosis and progressive macular degeneration, 
leading to blindness in the first three decades of life. It is associated with 
mutations in the cadherin 3 gene, resulting in the abnormal expression of 
P-cadherin. We report a case of a 4-year-old female patient diagnosed with this 
genodermatosis.
