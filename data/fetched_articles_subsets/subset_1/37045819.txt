Cancer cells exhibit elevated lipid synthesis. In breast and other cancer types, 
genes involved in lipid production are highly upregulated, but the mechanisms 
that control their expression remain poorly understood. Using integrated 
transcriptomic, lipidomic, and molecular studies, here we report that DAXX is a 
regulator of oncogenic lipogenesis. DAXX depletion attenuates, while its 
overexpression enhances, lipogenic gene expression, lipogenesis, and tumor 
growth. Mechanistically, DAXX interacts with SREBP1 and SREBP2 and activates 
SREBP-mediated transcription. DAXX associates with lipogenic gene promoters 
through SREBPs. Underscoring the critical roles for the DAXX-SREBP interaction 
for lipogenesis, SREBP2 knockdown attenuates tumor growth in cells with DAXX 
overexpression, and DAXX mutants unable to bind SREBP1/2 have weakened activity 
in promoting lipogenesis and tumor growth. Remarkably, a DAXX mutant deficient 
of SUMO-binding fails to activate SREBP1/2 and lipogenesis due to impaired SREBP 
binding and chromatin recruitment and is defective of stimulating tumorigenesis. 
Hence, DAXX's SUMO-binding activity is critical to oncogenic lipogenesis. 
Notably, a peptide corresponding to DAXX's C-terminal SUMO-interacting motif 
(SIM2) is cell-membrane permeable, disrupts the DAXX-SREBP1/2 interactions, and 
inhibits lipogenesis and tumor growth. These results establish DAXX as a 
regulator of lipogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy.
