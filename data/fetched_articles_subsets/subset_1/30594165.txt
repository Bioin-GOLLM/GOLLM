BACKGROUND: The GTPase KRas4B has been utilized as a principal target in the 
development of anticancer drugs. PDE6δ transports KRas4B to the plasma membrane, 
where it is released to activate various signaling pathways required for the 
initiation and maintenance of cancer. Therefore, identifying new small molecules 
that prevent activation of this GTPase by stabilizing the KRas4B-PDE6δ molecular 
complex is a practical strategy to fight against cancer.
METHODS: The crystal structure of the KRas4B-PDE6δ heterodimer was employed to 
locate possible specific binding sites at the protein-protein interface region. 
Virtual screening of Enamine-database compounds was performed on the located 
potential binding sites to identify ligands able to simultaneously bind to the 
KRas4B-PDE6δ heterodimer. A molecular dynamics approach was used to estimate the 
binding free-energy of the complex. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured 
by flow cytometry. G-LISA was used to measure Ras inactivation. Western blot was 
used to measure AKT and ERK activation. MIA PaCa-2 cells implanted 
subcutaneously into nude mice were treated with D14 or C22 and tumor volumes 
were recorded.
RESULTS: According to the binding affinity estimation, D14 and C22 stabilized 
the protein-protein interaction in the KRas4B-PDE6δ complex based on in vitro 
evaluation of the 38 compounds showing antineoplastic activity against 
pancreatic MIA PaCa-2 cancer cells. In this work, we further investigated the 
antineoplastic cellular properties of two of them, termed D14 and C22, which 
reduced the viability in the human pancreatic cancer cells lines MIA PaCa-2, 
PanC-1 and BxPC-3, but not in the normal pancreatic cell line hTERT-HPNE. 
Compounds D14 and C22 induced cellular death via apoptosis. D14 and C22 
significantly decreased Ras-GTP activity by 33% in MIA PaCa-2 cells. Moreover, 
D14 decreased AKT phosphorylation by 70% and ERK phosphorylation by 51%, while 
compound C22 reduced AKT phosphorylation by 60% and ERK phosphorylation by 36%. 
In addition, compounds C22 and D14 significantly reduced tumor growth by 88.6 
and 65.9%, respectively, in a mouse xenograft model.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified two promising compounds, D14 and C22, that might be 
useful as therapeutic drugs for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treatment.
