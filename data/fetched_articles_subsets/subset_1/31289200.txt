Prostacyclin (PGI2) controls platelet activation and thrombosis through a cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling cascade. However, in patients with 
cardiovascular diseases this protective mechanism fails for reasons that are 
unclear. Using both pharmacological and genetic approaches we describe a 
mechanism by which oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) associated with 
dyslipidemia promote platelet activation through impaired PGI2 sensitivity and 
diminished cAMP signaling. In functional assays using human platelets, oxLDL 
modulated the inhibitory effects of PGI2, but not a phosphodiesterase 
(PDE)-insensitive cAMP analog, on platelet aggregation, granule secretion and in 
vitro thrombosis. Examination of the mechanism revealed that oxLDL promoted the 
hydrolysis of cAMP through the phosphorylation and activation of PDE3A, leading 
to diminished cAMP signaling. PDE3A activation by oxLDL required Src family 
kinases, Syk and protein kinase C. The effects of oxLDL on platelet function and 
cAMP signaling were blocked by pharmacological inhibition of CD36, mimicked by 
CD36-specific oxidized phospholipids and ablated in CD36-/- murine platelets. 
The injection of oxLDL into wild-type mice strongly promoted FeCl3-induced 
carotid thrombosis in vivo, which was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of 
PDE3A. Furthermore, blood from dyslipidemic mice was associated with increased 
oxidative lipid stress, reduced platelet sensitivity to PGI2 ex vivo and 
diminished PKA signaling. In contrast, platelet sensitivity to a PDE-resistant 
cAMP analog remained normal. Genetic deletion of CD36 protected dyslipidemic 
animals from PGI2 hyposensitivity and restored PKA signaling. These data suggest 
that CD36 can translate atherogenic lipid stress into platelet hyperactivity 
through modulation of inhibitory cAMP signaling.
