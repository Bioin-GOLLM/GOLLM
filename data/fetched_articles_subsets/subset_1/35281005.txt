Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of sodium urate 
crystals in the joints. Hyperuricemia is the fundamental factor of gout. The 
onset of hyperuricemia is related to purine metabolism disorders or uric acid 
excretion disorders. Current studies have shown that the intestine is an 
important potential organ for the excretion of uric acid outside the kidneys. 
The excretion of uric acid of gut is mainly achieved through the action of uric 
acid transporters and the catabolism of intestinal flora, which plays an 
important role in the body's uric acid balance. Here we reviewed the effects of 
intestinal uric acid transporters and intestinal flora on uric acid excretion, 
and provide new ideas for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.
