Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted cytotoxic lymphocytes (CLs) 
such as natural killer (NK) cells can detect and destroy tumor and 
virus-infected cells resistant to T cell-mediated killing. Here, we performed 
genome-wide genetic screens to identify tumor-intrinsic genes regulating killing 
by MHC-unrestricted CLs. A group of genes identified in our screens encode 
enzymes for the biosynthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, 
which is not involved in tumor response to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Another 
gene identified in the screens was PBRM1, which encodes a subunit of the PBAF 
form of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. PBRM1 mutations in tumor cells 
cause resistance to MHC-unrestricted killing, in contrast to their sensitizing 
effects on T cell-mediated killing. PBRM1 and the GPI biosynthetic pathway 
regulate the ligands of NK cell receptors in tumor cells and promote cytolytic 
granule secretion in CLs. The regulators identified in this work represent 
potential targets for cancer immunotherapy.
