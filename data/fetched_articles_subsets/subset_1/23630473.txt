Recent studies suggest that intestinal microbiota influences gut-brain 
communication. In this study, we aimed to clarify the influence of intestinal 
microbiota on cerebral metabolism. We analyzed the cerebral metabolome of 
germ-free (GF) mice and Ex-GF mice, which were inoculated with suspension of 
feces obtained from specific pathogen-free mice, using capillary electrophoresis 
with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). CE-TOFMS identified 196 
metabolites from the cerebral metabolome in both GF and Ex-GF mice. The 
concentrations of 38 metabolites differed significantly (p < 0.05) between GF 
and Ex-GF mice. Approximately 10 of these metabolites are known to be involved 
in brain function, whilst the functions of the remainder are unclear. 
Furthermore, we observed a novel association between cerebral glycolytic 
metabolism and intestinal microbiota. Our work shows that cerebral metabolites 
are influenced by normal intestinal microbiota through the microbiota-gut-brain 
axis, and indicates that normal intestinal microbiota closely connected with 
brain health and disease, development, attenuation, learning, memory, and 
behavior.
