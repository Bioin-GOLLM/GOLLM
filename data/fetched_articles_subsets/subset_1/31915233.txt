Carbapenemases confer resistance to nearly all β-lactam antibiotics. The 
extensive spread of carbapenemase-producing multidrug-resistant bacteria 
contributes significantly to hospital-acquired infections. We have developed a 
novel protein-based binding assay that identifies KPC β-lactamases from clinical 
isolates. We used the protein-protein interaction between KPCs and a soluble 
β-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) variant, BLIPK74T/W112D, which 
specifically inhibits KPCs but not other β-lactamases. In this assay, 
BLIPK74T/W112D was allowed to form complexes with KPC-2 in bacterial cell 
lysates and then extracted using His tag binding resins. We demonstrated the 
presence of KPC-2 by monitoring the hydrolysis of a colorimetric β-lactam 
substrate. Also, to further increase the accuracy of the method, a 
BLIPK74T/W112D-mediated inhibition assay was developed. The binding and 
inhibition assays were validated by testing 127 Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical 
isolates with known genome sequences for the presence of KPC. Our assays 
identified a total of 32 strains as KPC-2 producers, a result in 100% 
concordance with genome sequencing predictions. To further simplify the assay 
and decrease the time to obtain results, the BLIPK74T/W112D protein was tested 
in combination with the widely used Carba-NP assay. For this purpose, the 
genome-sequenced K. pneumoniae strains were tested for the presence of 
carbapenemases with the Carba-NP test with and without the addition of 
BLIPK74T/W122D The test accurately identified carbapenemase-producing strains 
and the addition of BLIPK74T/W112D allowed a further determination that the 
strains contain KPC carbapenemase. Thus, the BLIPK74T/W112D protein is an 
effective sensor to specifically detect KPC β-lactamases produced by clinical 
isolates.IMPORTANCE Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae 
are associated with high therapeutic failure and mortality rates. Thus, it is 
critical to rapidly identify clinical isolates expressing KPC β-lactamases to 
facilitate administration of the correct antibiotic treatment and initiate 
infection control strategies. To address this problem, we developed a 
protein-based, KPC-specific binding assay in combination with a cell lysate 
inhibition assay that provided a 100% identification rate of KPC from clinical 
isolates of known genomic sequence. In addition, this protein sensor was adapted 
to the Carba-NP assay to provide a rapid strategy to detect KPC-producing 
isolates that will facilitate informed treatment of critically ill patients.
