Aromatase, a cytochrome P450, catalyzes three consecutive hydroxylation 
reactions converting C19 androgens to aromatic C18 estrogenic steroids. In this 
study, eight human aromatase mutants (I133Y, I133W, F235L, I395F, I474Y, I474W, 
I474M, and I474N) were prepared to evaluate the active site and a proposed 
hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme that exists in an aromatase model based on the 
X-ray structure of cytochrome P450cam. In addition, the binding characteristics 
of three steroidal inhibitors [4-hydroxyandrostenedione, 
7alpha-(4'-amino)phenylthio-1,4-androstandiene-3,17-dione, and bridge 
(2,19-methyleneoxy)androstene-3,17-dione (MDL 101,003)] and four nonsteroidal 
inhibitors [aminoglutethimide, CGS 20267, ICI D1033, and vorozole (R83842)] were 
investigated through inhibitory profile studies on the eight new and three 
previously generated mutants (P308F, D309A, and T310S). The latter analyses have 
provided a molecular basis regarding how seven aromatase inhibitors with 
different structures bind to the active site of aromatase.
