BACKGROUND: The findings of previous studies support the efficacy of cold water 
immersion (CWI) with carbon dioxide (CO2) in enhancing muscle blood flow and 
maintaining aerobic performance efficiency. We hypothesize that the addition of 
hydrogen gas (H2), known for its antioxidant properties and role in inflammation 
regulation, to C-CWI can enhance recovery after eccentric exercise.
SUBJECTS: and Methods: Thirty-four healthy subjects performed a knee-extensor 
eccentric exercise. They were randomly allocated into four groups: control, CWI, 
CO2-rich CWI (C-CWI), and CO2 + H2 gas mixture CWI (CH-CWI). In the three CWI 
groups, all subjects were immersed in the appropriate bath at 20 °C for 20 min 
immediately after 60 repetitions of eccentric exercise. Before exercise and 
after 48 h of recovery, the subjects' maximal voluntary isometric contraction 
torque (MVC-ISO), maximal voluntary concentric (MVC-CON) contraction torque, 
countermovement jump (CMJ) height, knee flexion range of motion (ROM), muscle 
soreness, and muscle thickness were measured.
RESULTS: In the CH-CWI group only, the MVC-ISO, CMJ height, and ROM did not 
decrease significantly post-exercise, whereas all of these decreased in the 
other three groups. Muscle soreness at palpation, contraction, and stretching 
significantly increased post-exercise in all groups. Echo intensity and tissue 
hardness did not increase significantly in the CH-CWI group.
CONCLUSIONS: CH-CWI stimulated recovery from impairments in MVC-ISO torque, CMJ 
height, knee-flexion ROM, tissue hardness, and echo intensity. These findings 
indicate that CH-CWI can promote recovery after eccentric exercise.
