A safe and broadly effective direct acting anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) agent 
that can withstand the viral mutation is needed. In this study, human single 
chain antibody variable fragments (HuscFvs) to conserved non-structural 
protein-5A (NS5A) of HCV were produced by phage display technology. Recombinant 
NS5A was used as bait for fishing-out the protein bound-phages from the 
HuscFv-phage display library. NS5A-bound HuscFvs produced by five phage 
transfected-E. coli clones were linked molecularly to nonaarginine (R9) for 
making them cell penetrable (become transbodies). The human monoclonal 
transbodies inhibited HCV replication in the HCVcc infected human hepatic cells 
and also rescued the cellular antiviral immune response from the viral 
suppression. Computerized simulation verified by immunoassays indicated that the 
transbodies used several residues in their multiple complementarity determining 
regions (CDRs) to form contact interface with many residues of the NS5A domain-I 
which is important for HCV replication complex formation and RNA binding as well 
as for interacting with several host proteins for viral immune evasion and 
regulation of cellular physiology. The human monoclonal transbodies have high 
potential for testing further as a new ramification of direct acting anti-HCV 
agent, either alone or in combination with their cognates that target other HCV 
proteins.
