BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several studies have reported that variants in CYP2R1 have 
been linked with an increased risk of hypertension. However, the interaction 
between CYP2R1 variants and environmental factors on the susceptibility of 
hypertension remained unclear. Therefore, this study evaluated the influence of 
CYP2R1 polymorphisms on hypertension susceptibility, and explored the 
interaction effect of CYP2R1 variations and obesity on the disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 766 incident hypertension cases matched with 
non-hypertension controls in a 1:1 ratio by sex, age (within 3 years). Two loci 
in CYP2R1 gene (rs10766197 and rs12794714) were genotyped by TaqMan probe 
assays. The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D was determined by human 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The associations of CYP2R1 
polymorphisms and risks of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) were analyzed by logistic 
regression. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to analyze the 
gene-environment interaction. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine 
the effect of CYP2R1 gene variations, and the interaction between CYP2R1 
variation and obesity on hypertension susceptibility. The results showed that 
rs10766197 (GG vs. AA) and rs12794714 (GG vs. AA) polymorphisms were both 
associated with an increased risk of VDD (OR = 1.49, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 1.08-2.05 and OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.19-2.25, respectively), after 
adjustment for potential risk factors. We also found that rs12794714 
polymorphism was significantly associated with elevated risk of hypertension 
under the dominant model (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.01-1.56). In addition, the 
interactions between rs12794714 with both general obesity (OR = 3.93, 95% 
CI = 2.72-5.68) and central obesity (OR = 3.22, 95% CI = 2.29-4.52) have 
significant effects on hypertension susceptibility.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provided further evidence that CYP2R1 variation was 
associated with a higher risk of hypertension in Chinese rural population. The 
interaction between CYP2R1 rs12794714 and obesity may increase the risk of 
hypertension.
