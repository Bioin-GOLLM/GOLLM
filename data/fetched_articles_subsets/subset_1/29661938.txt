Human β-tryptase, a tetrameric trypsin-like serine protease, is an important 
mediator of the allergic inflammatory responses in asthma. During acute 
hypersensitivity reactions, mast cells degranulate, releasing active tetramer as 
a complex with proteoglycans. Extensive efforts have focused on developing 
therapeutic β-tryptase inhibitors, but its unique activation mechanism is less 
well-explored. Tryptase is active only after proteolytic removal of the 
pro-domain followed by tetramer formation via two distinct symmetry-related 
interfaces. We show that the cleaved I16G mutant cannot tetramerize, likely due 
to impaired insertion of its N terminus into its "activation pocket," indicating 
allosteric linkage at multiple sites on each protomer. We engineered cysteines 
into each of the two distinct interfaces (Y75C for small or I99C for large) to 
assess the activity of each tetramer and disulfide-locked dimer. Using 
size-exclusion chromatography and enzymatic assays, we demonstrate that the two 
large tetramer interfaces regulate enzymatic activity, elucidating the 
importance of this protein-protein interaction for allosteric regulation. 
Notably, the I99C large interface dimer is active, even in the absence of 
heparin. We show that a monomeric β-tryptase mutant (I99C*/Y75A/Y37bA, where C* 
is cysteinylated Cys-99) cannot form a dimer or tetramer, yet it is active but 
only in the presence of heparin. Thus heparin both stabilizes the tetramer and 
allosterically conditions the active site. We hypothesize that each β-tryptase 
protomer in the tetramer has two distinct roles, acting both as a protease and 
as a cofactor for its neighboring protomer, to allosterically regulate enzymatic 
activity, providing a rationale for direct correlation of tetramer stability 
with proteolytic activity.
