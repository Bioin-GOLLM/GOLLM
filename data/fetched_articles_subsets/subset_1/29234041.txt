Plants produce hundreds of thousands of structurally diverse specialized 
metabolites via multistep biosynthetic networks, including compounds of 
ecological and therapeutic importance. These pathways are restricted to specific 
plant groups, and are excellent systems for understanding metabolic evolution. 
Tomato and other plants in the nightshade family synthesize protective acylated 
sugars in the tip cells of glandular trichomes on stems and leaves. We describe 
a metabolic innovation in wild tomato species that contributes to acylsucrose 
structural diversity. A small number of amino acid changes in two acylsucrose 
acyltransferases alter their acyl acceptor preferences, resulting in reversal of 
their order of reaction and increased product diversity. This study demonstrates 
how small numbers of amino acid changes in multiple pathway enzymes can lead to 
diversification of specialized metabolites in plants. It also highlights the 
power of a combined genetic, genomic and in vitro biochemical approach to 
identify the evolutionary mechanisms leading to metabolic novelty.
