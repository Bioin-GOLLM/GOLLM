Focal adhesions (FAs) link the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton to 
mediate cell adhesion, migration, mechanosensing and signalling. FAs have 
conserved nanoscale protein organization, suggesting that the position of 
proteins within FAs regulates their activity and function. Vinculin binds 
different FA proteins to mediate distinct cellular functions, but how vinculin's 
interactions are spatiotemporally organized within FAs is unknown. Using 
interferometric photoactivation localization super-resolution microscopy to 
assay vinculin nanoscale localization and a FRET biosensor to assay vinculin 
conformation, we found that upward repositioning within the FA during FA 
maturation facilitates vinculin activation and mechanical reinforcement of FAs. 
Inactive vinculin localizes to the lower integrin signalling layer in FAs by 
binding to phospho-paxillin. Talin binding activates vinculin and targets active 
vinculin higher in FAs where vinculin can engage retrograde actin flow. Thus, 
specific protein interactions are spatially segregated within FAs at the 
nanoscale to regulate vinculin activation and function.
