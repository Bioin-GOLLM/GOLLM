risk for pancreatic cancer in a subset of patients with and without germline 
CDKN2A mutations.

The risk of pancreatic cancer (PC) is increased in melanoma-prone families but 
the causal relationship between germline CDKN2A mutations and PC risk is 
uncertain, suggesting the existence of non-CDKN2A factors. One genetic 
possibility involves patients having mutations in multiple high-risk PC-related 
genes; however, no systematic examination has yet been conducted. We used 
next-generation sequencing data to examine 24 putative PC-related genes in 43 PC 
patients with and 23 PC patients without germline CDKN2A mutations and 1001 
controls. For each gene and the four pathways in which they occurred, we tested 
whether PC patients (overall or CDKN2A+ and CDKN2A- cases separately) had an 
increased number of rare nonsynonymous variants. Overall, we identified 35 
missense variants in PC patients, 14 in CDKN2A+ and 21 in CDKN2A- PC cases. We 
found nominally significant associations for mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, 
MSH6, PMS2) in all PC patients and for ATM, CPA1, and PMS2 in CDKN2A- PC 
patients. Further, nine CDKN2A+ and four CDKN2A- PC patients had rare 
potentially deleterious variants in multiple PC-related genes. Loss-of-function 
variants were only observed in CDKN2A- PC patients, with ATM having the most 
pathogenic variants. Also, ATM variants (n = 5) were only observed in CDKN2A- PC 
patients with a family history that included digestive system tumors. Our 
results suggest that a subset of PC patients may have increased risk because of 
germline mutations in multiple PC-related genes.
