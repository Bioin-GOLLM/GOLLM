Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is a heterogeneous disease that can evoke 
discordant responses to therapy among different lesions in individual patients. 
The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria do not take 
into consideration response heterogeneity. We explored and developed 
lesion-based measurement response criteria to evaluate their prognostic effect 
on overall survival (OS).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients enrolled in 17 first-line clinical trials, who 
had mCRC with ≥ 2 lesions at baseline, and a restaging scan by 12 weeks were 
included. For each patient, lesions were categorized as a progressing lesion 
(PL: > 20% increase in the longest diameter (LD)), responding lesion (RL: > 30% 
decrease in LD), or stable lesion (SL: neither PL nor RL) based on the 12-week 
scan. Lesion-based response criteria were defined for each patient as follows: 
PL only, SL only, RL only, and varied responses (mixture of RL, SL, and PL). 
Lesion-based response criteria and OS were correlated using stratified 
multivariable Cox models. The concordance between OS and classifications was 
measured using the C statistic.
RESULTS: Among 10,551 patients with mCRC from 17 first-line studies, varied 
responses were noted in 51.6% of patients, among whom, 3.3% had RL/PL at 12 
weeks. Among patients with RL/SL, 52% had stable disease (SD) by RECIST 1.1, and 
they had a longer OS (median OS (mOS) = 19.9 months) than those with SL only 
(mOS = 16.8 months, HR (95% CI) = 0.81 (0.76, 0.85), p < 0.001), although a 
shorter OS than those with RL only (mOS = 25.8 months, HR (95% CI) = 1.42 (1.32, 
1.53), p < 0.001). Among patients with SL/PL, 74% had SD by RECIST 1.1, and they 
had a longer OS (mOS = 9.0 months) than those with PL only (mOS = 8.0 months, HR 
(95% CI) = 0.75 (0.57, 0.98), p = 0.040), yet a shorter OS than those with SL 
only (mOS = 16.8 months, HR (95% CI) = 1.98 (1.80, 2.18), p < 0.001). These 
associations were consistent across treatment regimen subgroups. The 
lesion-based response criteria showed slightly higher concordance than RECIST 
1.1, although it was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Varied responses at first restaging are common among patients 
receiving first-line therapy for mCRC. Our lesion-based measurement criteria 
allowed for better mortality discrimination, which could potentially be 
informative for treatment decision-making and influence patient outcomes.
