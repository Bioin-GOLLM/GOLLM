Oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria is a key physiological process in 
higher eukaryotes including humans. The importance of the mitochondrial 
beta-oxidation system in humans is exemplified by the existence of a group of 
genetic diseases in man caused by an impairment in the mitochondrial oxidation 
of fatty acids. Identification of patients with a defect in mitochondrial 
beta-oxidation has long remained notoriously difficult, but the introduction of 
tandem-mass spectrometry in laboratories for genetic metabolic diseases has 
revolutionalized the field by allowing the rapid and sensitive analysis of 
acylcarnitines. Equally important is that much progress has been made with 
respect to the development of specific enzyme assays to identify the enzyme 
defect in patients subsequently followed by genetic analysis. In this review, we 
will describe the current state of knowledge in the field of fatty acid 
oxidation enzymology and its application to the follow-up analysis of positive 
neonatal screening results.
