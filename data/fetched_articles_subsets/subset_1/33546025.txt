Proteins in S100 family exhibit different expressions patterns and perform 
different cytological functions, playing substantial roles in certain cancers, 
carcinogenesis, and disease progression. However, the expression and role of 
S100 family members in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains 
unclear. To investigate the effect of S100 family members for the prognosis of 
liver cancer, we assessed overall survival (OS) using a Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM 
plotter) in liver cancer patients with different situation. Our results showed 
that 15 members of the S100 family exhibited high levels of expression and these 
levels were correlated with OS in liver cancer patients. The higher expression 
of S100A5, S100A7, S100A7A, S100A12, S100Z, and S100G was reflected with better 
survival in liver cancer patients. However, worse prognosis was related to 
higher levels of expression of S100A2, S100A6, S100A8, S100A9, S100A10, S100A11, 
S10013, S100A14, and S100P. We then evaluated the prognostic values of S100 
family members expression for evaluating different stages of AJCC-T, vascular 
invasion, alcohol consumption, and the presence of hepatitis virus in liver 
cancer patients. Lastly, we studied the prognostic values of S100 family members 
expression for patients after sorafenib treatment. In conclusion, our findings 
show that the proteins of S100 family members exhibit differential expression 
and may be useful as targets for liver cancer, facilitating novel diagnostic and 
therapeutic strategies in cancer.
