Type 1 secretion systems (T1SS) have a relatively simple architecture compared 
to other classes of secretion systems and therefore, are attractive to be 
optimized by protein engineering. Here, we report a KnowVolution campaign for 
the hemolysin (Hly) enhancer fragment, an untranslated region upstream of the 
hlyA gene, of the hemolysin T1SS of Escherichia coli to enhance its secretion 
efficiency. The best performing variant of the Hly enhancer fragment contained 
five nucleotide mutations at five positions (A30U, A36U, A54G, A81U, and A116U) 
resulted in a 2-fold increase in the secretion level of a model lipase fused to 
the secretion carrier HlyA1. Computational analysis suggested that altered 
affinity to the generated enhancer fragment towards the S1 ribosomal protein 
contributes to the enhanced secretion levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
involving a native terminator region along with the generated Hly enhancer 
fragment increased the secretion levels of the Hly system up to 5-fold.
