Regulation and functionality of species-specific alternative splicing has 
remained enigmatic to the present date. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein 
kinase IIβ (CaMKIIβ) is expressed in several splice variants and plays a key 
role in learning and memory. Here, we identify and characterize several 
primate-specific CAMK2B splice isoforms, which show altered kinetic properties 
and changes in substrate specificity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
primate-specific CAMK2B alternative splicing is achieved through branch point 
weakening during evolution. We show that reducing branch point and splice site 
strengths during evolution globally renders constitutive exons alternative, thus 
providing novel mechanistic insight into cis-directed species-specific 
alternative splicing regulation. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we introduce a weaker, human 
branch point sequence into the mouse genome, resulting in strongly altered 
Camk2b splicing in the brains of mutant mice. We observe a strong impairment of 
long-term potentiation in CA3-CA1 synapses of mutant mice, thus connecting 
branch point-controlled CAMK2B alternative splicing with a fundamental function 
in learning and memory.
