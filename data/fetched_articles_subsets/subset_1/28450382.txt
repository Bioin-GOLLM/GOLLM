Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway antagonists induce profound 
clinical responses in advanced cutaneous melanoma, but complete remissions are 
frustrated by the development of acquired resistance. Before resistance emerges, 
adaptive responses establish a mutation-independent drug tolerance. Antagonizing 
these adaptive responses could improve drug effects, thereby thwarting the 
emergence of acquired resistance. In this study, we reveal that inflammatory 
niches consisting of tumor-associated macrophages and fibroblasts contribute to 
treatment tolerance through a cytokine-signaling network that involves 
macrophage-derived IL-1β and fibroblast-derived CXCR2 ligands. Fibroblasts 
require IL-1β to produce CXCR2 ligands, and loss of host IL-1R signaling in vivo 
reduces melanoma growth. In tumors from patients on treatment, signaling from 
inflammatory niches is amplified in the presence of MAPK inhibitors. Signaling 
from inflammatory niches counteracts combined BRAF/MEK (MAPK/extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor treatment, and consequently, 
inhibiting IL-1R or CXCR2 signaling in vivo enhanced the efficacy of MAPK 
inhibitors. We conclude that melanoma inflammatory niches adapt to and confer 
drug tolerance toward BRAF and MEK inhibitors early during treatment.
