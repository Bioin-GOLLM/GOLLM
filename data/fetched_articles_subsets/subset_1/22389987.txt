Increasing expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) from 
fatty tissue affects the serum level and hence may stimulate expression of the 
other cytokines. The studies concerning the relation between TGF-beta1 
polymorphisms and obesity have been performed in adults, and diverse results 
have been reported. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of 
TGF-beta1 509 C/T, 915 G/C, 869 T/C polymorphisms in childhood obesity and 
related pathologies. Two hundred and seventy-one children and adolescents were 
included in the study. One hundred and twenty-one of these cases were in the 
Obese Group and 150 were in the Control Group. In the Obesity Group, we searched 
the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism disorders such as insulin resistance, 
dyslipidemia and hepatosteatosis. The results of this study revealed the lack of 
an association between TGF-beta1 509 C/T, 915 G/C and 869 T/C polymorphisms and 
obesity. There were no relations between the polymorphism genotypes and 
obesity-related metabolic disturbances.
