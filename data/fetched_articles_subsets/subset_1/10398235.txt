Of the gene-rich regions of the human genome, Xq28 is the most densely mapped. 
Mutations of genes in this band are responsible for 10 syndromal forms of mental 
retardation and 5 nonsyndromal forms. Clinical and molecular studies reported 
here add an additional syndromic form of X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) to 
this region. The condition comprises short stature, small hands and feet, 
seizures, cleft palate, and glaucoma. One affected male died at age 19 years in 
status epilepticus, but others have survived to old age. Carrier females do not 
have somatic anomalies or mental impairment. The gene is localized to the 
terminal 8 Mb of Xq28 with markers distal to DXS8011 showing linkage to the 
disorder with a lod score of 2.11 at zero recombination.
