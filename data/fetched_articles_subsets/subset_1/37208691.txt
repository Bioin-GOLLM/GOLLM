BACKGROUND: The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei has been used as a host 
organism for the production of lignocellulosic biomass-degrading enzymes. 
Although this microorganism has high potential for protein production, it has 
not yet been widely used for heterologous recombinant protein production. 
Transcriptional induction of the cellulase genes is essential for high-level 
protein production in T. reesei; however, glucose represses this transcriptional 
induction. Therefore, cellulose is commonly used as a carbon source for 
providing its degraded sugars such as cellobiose, which act as inducers to 
activate the strong promoters of the major cellulase (cellobiohydrolase 1 and 2 
(cbh1 and cbh2) genes. However, replacement of cbh1 and/or cbh2 with a gene 
encoding the protein of interest (POI) for high productivity and occupancy of 
recombinant proteins remarkably impairs the ability to release soluble inducers 
from cellulose, consequently reducing the production of POI. To overcome this 
challenge, we first used an inducer-free biomass-degrading enzyme expression 
system, previously developed to produce cellulases and hemicellulases using 
glucose as the sole carbon source, for recombinant protein production using T. 
reesei.
RESULTS: We chose endogenous secretory enzymes and heterologous camelid small 
antibodies (nanobody) as model proteins. By using the inducer-free strain as a 
parent, replacement of cbh1 with genes encoding two intrinsic enzymes (aspartic 
protease and glucoamylase) and three different nanobodies (1ZVH, caplacizumab, 
and ozoralizumab) resulted in their high secretory productions using glucose 
medium without inducers such as cellulose. Based on signal sequences (carrier 
polypeptides) and protease inhibitors, additional replacement of cbh2 with the 
nanobody gene increased the percentage of POI to about 20% of total secreted 
proteins in T. reesei. This allowed the production of caplacizumab, a bivalent 
nanobody, to be increased to 9.49-fold (508 mg/L) compared to the initial 
inducer-free strain.
CONCLUSIONS: In general, whereas the replacement of major cellulase genes leads 
to extreme decrease in the degradation capacity of cellulose, our inducer-free 
system enabled it and achieved high secretory production of POI with increased 
occupancy in glucose medium. This system would be a novel platform for 
heterologous recombinant protein production in T. reesei.
