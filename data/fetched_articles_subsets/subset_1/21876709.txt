Unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) is an alloimmune disease 
associated with the failure of fetal-maternal immunologic tolerance in which the 
regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) play a pivotal role. It is well known that 
Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) is a crucial regulatory factor for the development and 
function of Treg cells. It has also been established that deficiency of the 
Foxp3 gene suppresses the regulatory function of Treg cells. To determine if 
functional polymorphisms at the Foxp3 loci are associated with URSA in humans, 
we genotyped four common polymorphisms of Foxp3 gene in 146 unrelated URSA 
patients and 112 healthy women. The results showed that rs3761548A/C and 
rs2232365A/G polymorphisms were significantly associated with URSA. 
Additionally, we found that the allelic distribution of rs5902434 del/ATT in 
URSA group was slightly different from that in the control group. We conclude 
that functional polymorphisms of the Foxp3 gene may confer an important 
susceptibility to URSA in the Chinese Han population, probably by altering Foxp3 
function and/or its expression.
