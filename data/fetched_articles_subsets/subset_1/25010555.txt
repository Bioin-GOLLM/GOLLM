Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been reported to have an anabolic 
effect on bone in vivo, but comparative studies to identify inhibitors of 
osteoclast formation amongst ω3- and ω6-PUFAs are still lacking. Here we 
assessed the effects of the ω3-PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the ω6-PUFAs, arachidonic acid (AA) and 
γ-linolenic acid (GLA) on a RAW264.7 osteoclast differentiation model. The 
effects of PUFAs on RANKL-induced osteoclast formation were evaluated by 
counting tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated 
cells. PUFAs significantly inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in a 
dose-dependent manner with AA- and DHA-mediated inhibition being the strongest. 
Furthermore, RANKL-induced mRNA- and protein expression of the key 
osteoclastogenic genes cathepsin K and TRAP were inhibited by AA and more 
potently by DHA. Owing to the attenuated osteoclastogenesis by DHA and AA, actin 
ring formation and bone resorptive activity of these cells as evaluated on 
bone-mimetic plates were severely compromised. Hence, of the tested PUFAs, AA 
and DHA were found to be the most effective in inhibiting RANKL-induced 
osteoclast formation with the latter providing the strongest inhibitory effects. 
Collectively, the data indicates that these PUFAs may play an important role in 
regulating bone diseases characterized by excessive osteoclast activity.
