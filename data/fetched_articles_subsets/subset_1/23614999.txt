BACKGROUND: BMS-663068 is the phosphonooxymethyl prodrug of BMS-626529, a 
small-molecule attachment inhibitor that targets the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein 
gp120 preventing it from binding to CD4 T cells. In vitro investigations have 
demonstrated considerable variation in susceptibility of different HIV-1 
isolates to BMS-626529. BMS-663068 monotherapy in HIV-1-infected subjects 
produced a mean maximum change from baseline of -1.64 log10 copies per 
milliliter, but the response was variable.
METHODS: In this analysis, baseline and day 8 samples were analyzed for 
susceptibility to BMS-626529 and the presence of known HIV-1 attachment 
inhibitor resistance mutations. In addition, predictors of virological response 
(maximal HIV-1 RNA decline â‰¥1 log10 copies per milliliter) and resistance 
selection were investigated.
RESULTS: The only factor associated with reduced virological response was low 
baseline susceptibility to BMS-626529. There was no apparent relationship 
between virological response and baseline treatment experience, coreceptor 
tropism, plasma HIV-1 RNA level, or CD4 T-cell count. Examination of all 
positions with known BMS-626529 resistance mutations based on in vitro selection 
studies showed that gp120 M426L was the primary substitution most clearly 
associated with nonresponse to BMS-663068. There was minimal change in 
susceptibility to BMS-626529 over the course of the study and no clear evidence 
of emergence of a known HIV-1 attachment inhibitor resistance mutation in the 
majority of subjects as measured by standard population-based phenotypic and 
genotypic approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Nonresponse to BMS-663068 was associated with low baseline 
susceptibility to BMS-626529 and the presence of M426L. In this short-term 
trial, there was minimal evidence of selection for BMS-626529 high-level 
resistance over 8 days of monotherapy with BMS-663068 by population-based 
approaches.
