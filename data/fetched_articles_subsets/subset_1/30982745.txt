The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is a conserved 
ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factor. Whether NAC exerts chaperone 
activity and whether this function is restricted to de novo protein synthesis is 
unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NAC directly exerts chaperone activity toward 
structurally diverse model substrates including polyglutamine (PolyQ) proteins, 
firefly luciferase, and Aβ40. Strikingly, we identified the positively charged 
ribosome-binding domain in the N terminus of the βNAC subunit (N-βNAC) as a 
major chaperone entity of NAC. N-βNAC by itself suppressed aggregation of 
PolyQ-expanded proteins in vitro, and the positive charge of this domain was 
critical for this activity. Moreover, we found that NAC also exerts a 
ribosome-independent chaperone function in vivo. Consistently, we found that a 
substantial fraction of NAC is non-ribosomal bound in higher eukaryotes. In sum, 
NAC is a potent suppressor of aggregation and proteotoxicity of mutant 
PolyQ-expanded proteins associated with human diseases like Huntington's disease 
and spinocerebellar ataxias.
