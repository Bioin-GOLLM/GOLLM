BACKGROUND: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is a common approach to 
evaluate thyroid nodules. It offers definitive diagnosis of a benign or 
malignant nodule in the majority of cases. However, 10-25% of nodules yield one 
of three indeterminate cytologic diagnoses, leading to suboptimal management of 
these patients. Atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of 
undermined significance (AUS/FLUS) is a common indeterminate diagnosis, with the 
cancer risk ranging from 6% to 48%. This study assessed whether a multi-gene 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay can offer significant improvement in 
diagnosis in AUS/FLUS nodules.
METHODS: From May 2014 to March 2015, 465 consecutive FNA samples with the 
cytologic diagnosis of AUS/FLUS underwent prospective molecular testing using 
the ThyroSeq v2.1 panel. The panel included 14 genes analyzed for point 
mutations and 42 types of gene fusions occurring in thyroid cancer. In addition, 
eight genes were assessed for expression in order to evaluate the cell 
composition of FNA samples. Ninety-eight (21%) of these nodules had definitive 
surgical (n = 96) or nonsurgical (n = 2) follow-up and were used to determine 
the assay performance.
RESULTS: Among 465 AUS/FLUS nodules, three were found to be composed of 
parathyroid cells and 462 of thyroid follicular cells. Of the latter, 31 (6.7%) 
were positive for mutations. The most frequently mutated genes were NRAS and 
HRAS, and overall point mutations in seven different genes and five types of 
gene fusions were identified in these nodules. Among 98 nodules with known 
outcome, histologic analysis revealed 22 (22.5%) cancers. ThyroSeq v2.1 was able 
to classify 20/22 cancers correctly, showing a sensitivity of 90.9% [confidence 
interval (CI) 78.8-100], specificity of 92.1% [CI 86.0-98.2], positive 
predictive value of 76.9% [CI 60.7-93.1], and negative predictive value of 97.2% 
[CI 78.8-100], with an overall accuracy of 91.8% [CI 86.4-97.3].
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study demonstrate that the ThyroSeq v2.1 
multi-gene NGS panel of molecular markers provides both high sensitivity and 
high specificity for cancer detection in thyroid nodules with AUS/FLUS cytology, 
which should allow improved management for these patients.
