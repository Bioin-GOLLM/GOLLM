AIM: To identify genetic markers associated with vincristine-induced peripheral 
neuropathy (VIPN) in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PATIENTS & METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing data were combined with exome-wide 
association study to identify predicted-functional germline variants associated 
with high-grade VIPN. Genotyping was then performed for top-ranked signals (n 
= 237), followed by validation in independent replication group (n = 405).
RESULTS: Minor alleles of rs2781377/SYNE2 (p = 0.01) and rs10513762/MRPL47 
(p = 0.01) showed increased risk, whereas that of rs3803357/BAHD1 had a 
protective effect (p = 0.007). Using a genetic model based on weighted genetic 
risk scores, an additive effect of combining these loci was observed 
(p = 0.003). The addition of rs1135989/ACTG1 further enhanced model performance 
(p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Variants in SYNE2, MRPL47 and BAHD1 genes are putative new risk 
factors for VIPN in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
