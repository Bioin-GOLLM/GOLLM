The P2X(7) receptor is a ligand-gated cation-selective channel that mediates 
ATP-induced apoptosis of cells of the immune system. A loss-of-function single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 1513 (1513 A-->C) of the P2X(7) gene 
has recently been identified in both healthy and chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL) B-cells, translating into a loss of P2X(7)-mediated apoptosis in these 
cells. This antiapoptotic effect results in increased B-cell numbers, thereby 
potentially contributing to the survival of B-CLL clones. It was hypothesized 
that prolonged cell survival may also predispose to induction of autoimmunity. 
The objective of this study is to analyze the role of the P2X(7) receptor and 
its loss-of-function 1513 A-->C polymorphism (SNP) in the development of 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). DNA samples obtained from patients with 
sporadic SLE were analyzed for the presence of the 1513 A-->C polymorphism using 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and then direct sequencing. No 
significant difference in allele frequencies (1513 A-->C polymorphism) between 
sporadic cases of SLE and controls was found. A loss-of-function SNP at position 
1513 (1513 A-->C) of the P2X(7) gene does not appear to be a susceptibility gene 
locus for the development of sporadic SLE.
