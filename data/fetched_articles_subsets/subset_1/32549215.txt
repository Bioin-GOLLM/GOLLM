Lynch syndrome (LS) is associated with the highest risk of colorectal (CRC) and 
several extracolonic cancers. In our effort to characterize LS families from 
Latin America, this study aimed to describe the spectrum of neoplasms and cancer 
risk by gender, age and gene, and survival in 34 Chilean LS families. Of them, 
59% harbored path_MLH1, 23% path_MSH2, 12% path_PMS2 and 6% path_EPCAM variants. 
A total of 866 individuals at risk were identified, of which 213 (24.6%) 
developed 308 neoplasms. In males, CRC was the most common cancer (72.6%), while 
females showed a greater frequency of extracolonic cancers (58.4%), including 
uterus and breast (p < 0.0001). The cumulative incidence of extracolonic cancers 
was higher in females than males (p = 0.001). Path_MLH1 variants are 
significantly more associated with the development of CRC than extracolonic 
tumors (59.5% vs. 40.5%) when compared to path_MSH2 (47.5% vs. 52.5%) variants 
(p = 0.05018). The cumulative incidence of CRC was higher in path_MLH1/path_MSH2 
carriers compared to path_PMS2 carriers (p = 0.03). In addition, path_MSH2 
carriers showed higher risk of extracolonic tumors (p = 0.002). In conclusion, 
this study provides a snapshot of the LS profile from Chile and the current 
LS-associated diagnostic practice and output in Chile. Categorizing cancer risks 
associated with each population is relevant in the genetic counselling of LS 
patients.
