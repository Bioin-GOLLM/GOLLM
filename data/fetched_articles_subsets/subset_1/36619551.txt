The pubertal development onset is controlled by a network of genes that regulate 
the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatile release and the subsequent 
increase of the circulating levels of pituitary gonadotropins that activate the 
gonadal function. Although the transition from pre-pubertal condition to puberty 
occurs physiologically in a delimited age-range, the inception of pubertal 
development can be anticipated or delayed due to genetic and epigenetic changes 
or environmental conditions. Most of the genetic and epigenetic alterations 
concern genes which encode for kisspeptin, GnRH, LH, FSH and their receptor, 
which represent crucial factors of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) 
axis. Recent data indicate a central role of the epigenome in the regulation of 
genes in the hypothalamus and pituitary that could mediate the flexibility of 
pubertal timing. Identification of epigenetically regulated genes, such as 
Makorin ring finger 3 (MKRN3) and Delta-like 1 homologue (DLK1), respectively 
responsible for the repression and the activation of pubertal development, 
provides additional evidence of how epigenetic variations affect pubertal 
timing. This review aims to investigate genetic, epigenetic, and environmental 
factors responsible for the regulation of precocious and delayed puberty.
