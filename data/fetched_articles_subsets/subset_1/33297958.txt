BACKGROUND: The CD4 protein is an important surface marker of T lymphocytes, 
which can mediate the antigen presentation process by interacting with MHC II 
and TCR molecules in human and mouse.
RESULTS: In this study, two haplotypes (A and B) of the CD4 gene were found 
within Chinese indigenous and Western commercial pig breeds. These two 
haplotypes were defined by 22 fully linked SNPs in the CDS region of the CD4 
gene. The expression level and localization of the CD4 protein were 
significantly different between haplotypes A and B. Transcriptome analysis 
revealed that the immune response-related genes and signaling pathways were 
down-regulated in genotype AA. Finally, three linked functional SNPs were 
identified, which affected the expression level and membrane localization of the 
CD4 protein in pigs. These three SNPs led to the replacements of two amino acids 
in the IgV1 domain of the CD4 protein, and related to the function of the CD4 
protein in the immune response.
CONCLUSION: These three linked SNPs were the key functional mutation sites in 
the CD4 gene, which played important roles in the immune response, and could be 
utilized as new molecular markers in breeding for disease resistance in pigs.
