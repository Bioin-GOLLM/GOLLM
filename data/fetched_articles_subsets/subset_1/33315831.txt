PURPOSE: RTN4IP1 biallelic mutations cause a recessive optic atrophy, sometimes 
associated to more severe neurological syndromes, but so far, no retinal 
phenotype has been reported in RTN4IP1 patients, justifying their reappraisal.
METHODS: Seven patients from four families carrying biallelic RTN4IP1 variants 
were retrospectively reviewed, with emphasis on their age of onset, visual 
acuity, multimodal imaging including color and autofluorescence frames, 
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography with RNFL and macular analyses.
RESULTS: Seven patients from four RTN4IP1 families developed in their first 
decade of life a bilateral recessive optic atrophy with severe central visual 
loss, and primary nystagmus developed in 5 of 7 patients. Six patients were 
legally blind. In a second stage, the seven individuals developed a rod-cone 
dystrophy, sparing the macular zone and the far periphery. This retinal damage 
was identified by 55° field fundus autofluorescence frames and also by 
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scans of the temporal part of the 
macular zone in five of the seven patients. Full-field electroretinography 
measurements disclosed reduced b-wave amplitude of the rod responses in all 
patients but two. Family 4 with the p.R103H and c.601A > T (p.K201*) truncating 
mutation had further combined neurological signs with cerebellar ataxia, 
seizures, and intellectual disability.
CONCLUSION: RTN4IP1 recessive optic atrophy is systematically associated to a 
rod-cone dystrophy, which suggests that both the retinal ganglion cells and the 
rods are affected as a result of a deficit in the mitochondrial respiratory 
chain. Thus, systematic widefield autofluorescence frames and temporal macular 
scans are recommended for the evaluation of patients with optic neuropathies.
