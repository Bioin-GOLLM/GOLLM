Post-translational modification of histones provides an important regulatory 
platform for processes such as gene transcription and DNA damage repair. It has 
become increasingly apparent that the misregulation of histone modification, 
which is caused by the deregulation of factors that mediate the modification 
installation, removal and/or interpretation, actively contributes to human 
cancer. In this Review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the 
interpretation of certain histone methylations by plant homeodomain 
finger-containing proteins, and how misreading, miswriting and mis-erasing of 
histone methylation marks can be associated with oncogenesis and progression. 
These observations provide us with a greater mechanistic understanding of 
epigenetic alterations in human cancers and might also help direct new 
therapeutic interventions in the future.
