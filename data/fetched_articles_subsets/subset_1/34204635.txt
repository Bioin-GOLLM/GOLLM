Wholegrain oats contain a variety of phenolic compounds thought to help maintain 
healthy vascular function, through the maintenance of local levels of the 
vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Thus, the full molecular mechanisms involved are 
not yet clear. With this work we aim to understand the possible cellular 
mechanisms by which avenanthramides and ferulic acid derivatives, present in 
oats, may help maintain a healthy vascular function through the modulation of 
the NO pathway. Primary Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) were 
exposed to ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, hydroferulic acid, ferulic acid 
4-O-glucuronide, isoferulic acid 3-O-sulfate, dihydroferulic acid 
4-O-glucuronide, avenanthramide A, avenanthramide B and avenanthramide C (1 μM) 
or vehicle (methanol) for 24 h. Apocynin and Nω-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) were 
additionally included as controls. NO and cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels, superoxide 
production and the activation of the Akt1/eNOS pathway were assessed. The 
statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey 
post-hoc t-test. Apocynin and all phenolic compounds increased NO levels in 
HUVEC cells (increased DAF2-DA fluorescence and cGMP), and significantly reduced 
superoxide levels. Protein expression results highlighted an increase in the 
Akt1 activation state, and increased eNOS expression. Overall, our results 
indicated that the glucuronide metabolites do not enhance NO production through 
the Akt1/eNOS pathway, thus all compounds tested are able to reduce NO 
degradation through reduced superoxide formation.
