Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem with very high 
prevalence and mortality. Yet, there is a paucity of effective treatment 
options, partly due to insufficient knowledge of underlying pathophysiology. We 
combined metabolomics (GCMS) with kidney gene expression studies to identify 
metabolic pathways that are altered in adults with non-diabetic stage 3-4 CKD 
versus healthy adults. Urinary excretion rate of 27 metabolites and plasma 
concentration of 33 metabolites differed significantly in CKD patients versus 
controls (estimate range-68% to +113%). Pathway analysis revealed that the 
citric acid cycle was the most significantly affected, with urinary excretion of 
citrate, cis-aconitate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate and succinate reduced by 
40-68%. Reduction of the citric acid cycle metabolites in urine was replicated 
in an independent cohort. Expression of genes regulating aconitate, isocitrate, 
2-oxoglutarate and succinate were significantly reduced in kidney biopsies. We 
observed increased urine citrate excretion (+74%, p=0.00009) and plasma 
2-oxoglutarate concentrations (+12%, p=0.002) in CKD patients during treatment 
with a vitamin-D receptor agonist in a randomized trial. In conclusion, urinary 
excretion of citric acid cycle metabolites and renal expression of genes 
regulating these metabolites were reduced in non-diabetic CKD. This supports the 
emerging view of CKD as a state of mitochondrial dysfunction.
