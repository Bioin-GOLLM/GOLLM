BACKGROUND: The generalizability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinical trial 
efficacy findings to routine care settings is not well studied. We compared the 
relative effectiveness of initial ART regimens estimated in AIDS Clinical Trial 
Group (ACTG) randomized controlled trials with that among patients receiving ART 
at Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (ART-CC) study sites.
METHODS: Treatment-naive HIV-infected patients initiating identical ART regimens 
in ACTG trials (A5095 and A5142) and at 15 ART-CC cohort study sites were 
included. Virological failure (HIV-1 RNA >200 copies/mL) at 24 and 48 weeks, 
incident AIDS-defining events and mortality were measured according to study 
design (ART-CC cohort vs. ACTG trial) and stratified by third drug [abacavir 
(ABC), efavirenz (EFV), and lopinavir/r (LPV/r)]. We used logistic regression to 
estimate and compare odds ratios (OR) for virological failure between different 
regimens and study designs, and used Cox models to estimate and compare hazard 
ratios for AIDS and death.
RESULTS: Compared with patients receiving ABC, those receiving EFV had roughly 
half the odds of 24-week virologic failure (>200 copies/mL) in both ACTG 5095 
(OR = 0.53, 95% confidence interval: 0.36 to 0.79) and ART-CC (0.46, 0.37 to 
0.57). Virologic superiority of EFV (vs. ABC) seemed comparable in ART-CC and 
ACTG 5095 (ratio of ORs 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.54 to 1.35). Odds 
ratios for 48-week virologic failure, comparing EFV with LPV/r, were also 
comparable in ACTG 5142 and ART-CC (ratio of ORs: 0.87, 0.45 to 1.69).
CONCLUSIONS: Between ART regimen virologic efficacy of third drugs ABC, EFV, and 
LPV/r observed in the ACTG 5095 and 5142 trials seem generalizable to the 
routine care setting of ART-CC clinical cohorts.
