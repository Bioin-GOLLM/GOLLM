Some mutations which occur in the α/β-discordant region (resides 15 to 23) of 
β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) lead to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). In vitro 
studies have shown that these genetic mutations could accelerate Aβ aggregation. 
We recently showed that mutations in this region could alter the structural 
propensity, resulting in a different aggregative propensity of Aβ. Whether these 
genetic mutations display similar effects remains largely unknown. Here, we 
characterized the structural propensity and aggregation kinetics of Dutch-type 
Aβ40 (Aβ40(E22Q)) and its L17A/F19A-substituted mutant (Aβ40(L17A/F19A/E22Q)) 
using circular dichroism spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic spectroscopy, and 
thioflavin T fluorescence assay. In comparison with wild-type Aβ40, we found 
that Dutch-type mutation, unlike Artic-type mutation (E22G), does not reduce the 
α-helical propensity of the α/β-discordant region in sodium dodecyl sulfate 
micellar solution. Moreover, we found that Aβ40(L17A/F19A/E22Q) displays a 
higher α-helical propensity of the α/β-discordant region and a slower 
aggregation rate than Aβ40(E22Q), suggesting that the inhibition of aggregation 
might be via increasing the α-helical propensity of the α/β-discordant region, 
similar to that observed in wild-type and Artic-type Aβ40. Taken together, 
Dutch-type and Artic-type mutations adopt different mechanisms to promote Aβ 
aggregation, however, the L17A/F19A mutation could increase the α-helical 
propensities of both Dutch-type and Artic-type Aβ40 and inhibit their 
aggregation.
