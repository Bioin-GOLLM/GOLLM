The relative importance of mutation, selection, and biased gene conversion to 
patterns of base composition variation in Drosophila melanogaster, and to a 
lesser extent, D. simulans, has been investigated for many years. However, 
genomic data from sufficiently large samples to thoroughly characterize patterns 
of base composition polymorphism within species have been lacking. Here, we 
report a genome-wide analysis of coding and noncoding polymorphism in a large 
sample of inbred D. melanogaster strains from Raleigh, North Carolina. 
Consistent with previous results, we observed that AT mutations fix more 
frequently than GC mutations in D. melanogaster. Contrary to predictions of 
previous models of codon usage in D. melanogaster, we found that synonymous 
sites segregating for derived AT polymorphisms were less skewed toward low 
frequencies compared with sites segregating a derived GC polymorphism. However, 
no such pattern was observed for comparable base composition polymorphisms in 
noncoding DNA. These results suggest that AT-ending codons could currently be 
favored by natural selection in the D. melanogaster lineage.
