Thanatophoric dysplasia type I (TDI) is a lethal human skeletal growth disorder 
with a prevalence of 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 50,000 births. TDI is known to arise 
because of five different mutations, all involving the substitution of an amino 
acid with a cysteine in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Cysteine 
mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been previously proposed to 
induce constitutive dimerization in the absence of ligand, leading to receptor 
overactivation. However, their effect on RTK dimer stability has never been 
measured experimentally. In this study, we characterize the effect of three TDI 
mutations, Arg248Cys, Ser249Cys, and Tyr373Cys, on FGFR3 dimerization in 
mammalian membranes, in the absence of ligand. We demonstrate that the mutations 
lead to surprisingly modest dimer stabilization and to structural perturbations 
of the dimers, challenging the current understanding of the molecular 
interactions that underlie TDI.
