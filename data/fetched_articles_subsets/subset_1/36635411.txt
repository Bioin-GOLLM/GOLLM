Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of major concern in pregnancy than can 
lead to intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption and stillbirth. The 
pathophysiology of preeclampsia is multifactorial, including not only kidney 
dysfunction but also endothelial dysfunction, as the maternal endothelium 
becomes exposed to placental factors that are released into the circulation and 
increase systemic levels of vasoconstrictors, oxidative stress, anti-angiogenic 
factors and inflammatory mediators. Importantly, inflammation can lead to 
insufficient placental perfusion and low birthweight in offspring. Various 
innate and adaptive immune cells and mediators have been implicated in the 
development of preeclampsia, in which oxidative stress is associated with 
activation of the maternal inflammatory response. Immune cells such as 
regulatory T cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, and neutrophils are known 
to have major causative roles in the pathology of preeclampsia, but the 
contributions of additional immune cells such as B cells, inflammatory cytokines 
and anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor autoantibodies are also now recognized. 
Immunological interventions, therefore, have therapeutic potential in this 
disease. Here, we provide an overview of the immune responses that are involved 
in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, including the role of innate and adaptive 
immune cells and mediators.
