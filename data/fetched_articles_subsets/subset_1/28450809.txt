BACKGROUND: Tumour radiosensitivity would be particularly useful in optimizing 
the radiation dose during radiotherapy. The aim of the current study was to 
evaluate the potential value of phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) and ATM (pATM) in 
assessing 12C6+ radiosensitivity of tumour cells.
METHODS: Human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, hepatoma HepG2 cells, and 
mucoepidermoid carcinoma MEC-1 cells were irradiated with different doses of 
12C6+. The survival fraction was assayed with clonogenic survival method and the 
foci of γH2AX and pATM was visualized using immunocytochemical methods. Flow 
cytometry was used to assay γH2AX, pATM and the cell cycle.
RESULTS: The survival fraction decreased immediately in dose-dependent manner, 
but in turn, significantly increased during 24 h after 12C6+ irradiation. Both 
γH2AX and pATM foci accumulated linearly with doses and with a maximum induction 
at 0.5 h for γH2AX and 0.5 or 4 h for pATM, respectively, and a fraction foci 
kept for 24 h. The expression of γH2AX and pATM was in relation to cell cycle. 
The G0/G1 phase cells had the highest expression of γH2AX after 0.5 h 
irradiation and then decreased to a lower level at 24 h after irradiation. An 
obvious increase of pATM in G2/M phase was shown after 24 h of 2 and 4 Gy 
irradiation. The significant G2/M phase arrest was shown. There was a close 
relationship between the clonogenic survival and γH2AX and pATM expression both 
in timing and dose in response to 12C6+.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of γH2AX and pATM formation and loss may be an important 
factor in the response of cells to 12C6+. pATM and γH2AX are effective radiation 
biomarkers in assessing the radiosensitivity of 12C6+ in human tumor cells.
