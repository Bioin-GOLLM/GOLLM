The ACMG/AMP variant classification framework was intended for highly penetrant 
Mendelian conditions. While it is appreciated that clinically relevant variants 
exhibit a wide spectrum of penetrance, accurately assessing and expressing the 
pathogenicity of variants with lower penetrance can be challenging. The vinculin 
(VCL) gene illustrates these challenges. Model organism data provide evidence 
that loss of function of VCL may play a role in cardiomyopathy and aggregate 
case-control studies suggest low penetrance. VCL loss of function variants, 
however, are rarely identified in affected probands and therefore there is a 
paucity of family studies clarifying the clinical significance of individual 
variants. This study, which aggregated data from >18,000 individuals who 
underwent gene panel or exome testing for inherited cardiomyopathies, identified 
32 probands with VCL loss-of-function variants and confirmed enrichment in 
probands with dilated cardiomyopathy (odds ratio [OR] = 9.01; confidence 
interval [CI] = 4.93-16.45). Our data revealed that the majority of these 
individuals (89.5%) had pediatric onset of disease. Family studies demonstrated 
that heterozygous loss of function of VCL alone is insufficient to cause 
cardiomyopathy but that these variants do contribute to disease risk. In 
conclusion, VCL loss-of-function variants should be reported in a diagnostic 
setting but need to be clearly distinguished as having lower penetrance.
