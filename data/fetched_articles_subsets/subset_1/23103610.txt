The increase in obesity in the Unites States and around the world in the last 
decade is overwhelming. The number of overweight adults in the world surpassed 1 
billion in 2008. Health hazards associated with obesity are serious and include 
heart disease, sleep apnea, diabetes, and cancer. Although lifestyle 
modifications are the most straightforward way to control weight, a large 
portion of the population may not be able to rely on this modality alone. Thus, 
the development of anti-obesity therapeutics represents a major unmet medical 
need. Historically, anti-obesity pharmacotherapies have been unsafe and 
minimally efficacious. A better understanding of the biology of appetite and 
metabolism provides an opportunity to develop drugs that may offer safer and 
more effective alternatives for weight management. This review discusses drugs 
that are currently on the market and in development as anti-obesity therapeutics 
based on their target and mechanism of action. It should serve as a roadmap to 
establish expectations for the near future for anti-obesity drug development.
