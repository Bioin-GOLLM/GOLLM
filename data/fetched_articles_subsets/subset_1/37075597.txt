The expression of MHC-II and CD86 on the surface of antigen-presenting cells 
(APCs) must be tightly regulated to foster antigen-specific CD4 T-cell 
activation and to prevent autoimmunity. Surface expression of these proteins is 
regulated by their dynamic ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase March-I. 
March-I promotes turnover of peptide-MHC-II complexes on resting APCs and 
termination of March-I expression promotes MHC-II and CD86 surface stability. In 
this review, we will highlight recent studies examining March-I function in both 
normal and pathological conditions.
