Immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies) are a 
standard of care for advanced melanoma. Novel toxicities comprise immune-related 
adverse events (irAE). With increasing use, irAE require recognition, practical 
management strategies, and multidisciplinary care. We retrospectively evaluated 
the incidence, kinetics, and management of irAE in 41 patients receiving 
anti-PD-1 antibody therapy (pembrolizumab) for advanced melanoma. 63% received 
prior anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy (ipilimumab). IrAE occurred in 54%, most 
commonly dermatological (24%), rheumatological (22%), and thyroid dysfunction 
(12%). Thyroiditis was characterised by a brief asymptomatic hyperthyroid phase 
followed by a symptomatic hypothyroid phase requiring thyroxine replacement. 
Transplant rejection doses of methylprednisolone were necessary to manage 
refractory hepatotoxicity. A bullous pemphigoid-like skin reaction with 
refractory pruritus responded to corticosteroids and neuropathic analgesia. 
Disabling grade 3-4 oligoarthritis required sulfasalazine therapy in combination 
with steroids. The median interval between the last dose of anti-CTLA-4 antibody 
and the first dose of anti-PD-1 therapy was 2.0 months (range: 0.4 to 22.4). 
Toxicities may occur late; this requires vigilance and multidisciplinary 
management which may allow effective anticancer therapy to continue. Management 
algorithms for thyroiditis, hypophysitis, arthralgia/arthritis, colitis, 
steroid-refractory hepatitis, and skin toxicity are discussed.
