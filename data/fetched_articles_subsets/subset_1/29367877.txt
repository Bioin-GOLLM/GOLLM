It has been reported that dozens of WNT10A variants are associated with human 
isolated tooth agenesis, however, little is known about the precise phenotypes. 
In 50 Japanese patients with severe congenital tooth agenesis, we identified 11 
patients with WNT10A variants. Comparing phenotypes between the tooth agenesis 
patients carrying the wild-type and variants of WNT10A, we revealed that the 
development of lateral incisors is relatively susceptive to insufficiency of 
WNT/Î²-catenin signaling.
