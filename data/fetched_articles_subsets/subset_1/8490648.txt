Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a combination of deafness and pigmentary 
disturbances, normally inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The pathology 
involves neural crest derivatives, but WS is heterogeneous clinically and 
genetically. Some type I WS families show linkage with markers on distal 2q and 
in three cases the disease has been attributed to mutations in the PAX3 gene. 
PAX3 encodes a paired domain, a highly conserved octapeptide and probably also a 
paired-type homeodomain. Here we describe a further three PAX3 mutations which 
cause WS; one alters the octapeptide motif plus the presumed homeodomain; a 
second alters all three elements and the third alters the paired box alone. The 
latter occurs in a family with probable type 2 WS, a clinical variant usually 
considered not to be allelic with type 1 WS.
