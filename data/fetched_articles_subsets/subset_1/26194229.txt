Undoubtedly livestock is one of the major contributors to the economy of any 
country. The economic value of livestock includes meat, dairy products, fiber, 
fertilizer etc. Understanding and identifying the associations of quantitative 
trait loci (QTL) with the economically important traits is believed to 
substantially benefit the livestock industry. The past two decades have seen a 
flurry of interest in mapping the QTL associated with traits of economic 
importance on the genome. With the availability of single nucleotide 
polymorphism chip of various densities it is possible to identify regions, QTL 
and genes on the genome that explain the association and its effect on the 
phenotype under consideration. Remarkable advancement has been seen in genome 
wide association studies (GWAS) since its inception till the present day. In 
this review we describe the progress and challenges of GWAS in various livestock 
species.
