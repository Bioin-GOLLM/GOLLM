In this study, we demonstrated that pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) 
nasally administered with a nontoxic A subunit mutant of cholera toxin (mCT) 
S61F elicited a protective immune response. Immunization with PspA and mCT 
elicited higher levels of PspA-specific IgG and IgA Abs in serum and of IgG and 
IgA anti-PspA Ab-forming cells in spleens, cervical lymph nodes (CLN), and lung 
tissue when compared to nonimmunized mice. Furthermore, significant 
PspA-specific IgA Abs were induced in saliva and nasal secretions. These 
responses were dependent on the use of mCT as a mucosal adjuvant. The 
PspA-specific Ab responses induced by mCT S61F were comparable with those 
induced by native CT (nCT). Analysis of cytokine responses showed that nasal 
PspA plus mCT S61F enhanced the induction of PspA-specific CD4+ T cells 
producing IL-4 but not IFN-gamma in CLN at both the protein and mRNA levels. 
Importantly, significant numbers of mice intranasally immunized with PspA plus 
mCT S61F were protected from lethal challenge with capsular serotype 3 
Streptococcus pneumoniae A66. These results show that intranasal administration 
of PspA together with mCT S61F is an effective mucosal vaccine against 
pneumococcal infection and induces CD4+ Th2-type cells, which provide help for 
both mucosal and systemic Ab responses.
