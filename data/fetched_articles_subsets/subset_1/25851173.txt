Post-transcriptional regulation of RNA is an important mechanism for activating 
and resolving cellular stress responses. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-13 
(PARP13), also known as ZC3HAV1 and zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), is an 
RNA-binding protein that regulates the stability and translation of specific 
mRNAs, and modulates the miRNA silencing pathway to globally affect miRNA 
targets. These functions of PARP13 are important components of the cellular 
response to stress. In addition, the ability of PARP13 to restrict oncogenic 
viruses and to repress the prosurvival cytokine receptor tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 4 (TRAILR4) suggests that it 
can be protective against malignant transformation and cancer development. The 
relevance of PARP13 to human health and disease make it a promising therapeutic 
target.
