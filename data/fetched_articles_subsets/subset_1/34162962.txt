In humans, most renal functions, including urine volume and electrolyte 
excretions, have a circadian rhythm. Light is a strong circadian entrainment 
factor and daytime-light exposure is known to affect the circadian rhythm of 
rectal temperature (RT). The effects of daytime-light exposure on the diurnal 
rhythm of urinary excretion have yet to be clarified. The aim of this study was 
to clarify whether and how daytime exposure to bright-light affects urinary 
excretions. Twenty-one healthy men (21-27 years old) participated in a 4-day 
study involving daytime (08:00-18:00 h) exposure to two light conditions, Dim 
(< 50 lx) and Bright (~ 2500 lx), in a random order. During the experiment, RT 
was measured continuously. Urine samples were collected every 3 ~ 4 h. Compared 
to the Dim condition, under the Bright condition, the RT nadir time was 45 min 
earlier (p = 0.017) and sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), and uric acid (UA) excretion 
and urine volumes were greater (all p < 0.001), from 11:00 h to 13:00 h without 
a difference in total daily urine volume. The present results suggest that 
daytime bright light exposure can induce a phase shift advance in urine volume 
and urinary Na, Cl, and UA excretion rhythms.
