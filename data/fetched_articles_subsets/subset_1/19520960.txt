Rotavirus outer-layer protein VP7 is a principal target of protective 
antibodies. Removal of free calcium ions (Ca2+) dissociates VP7 trimers into 
monomers, releasing VP7 from the virion, and initiates penetration-inducing 
conformational changes in the other outer-layer protein, VP4. We report the 
crystal structure at 3.4 angstrom resolution of VP7 bound with the Fab fragment 
of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. The Fab binds across the outer surface of 
the intersubunit contact, which contains two Ca2+ sites. Mutations that escape 
neutralization by other antibodies suggest that the same region bears the 
epitopes of most neutralizing antibodies. The monovalent Fab is sufficient to 
neutralize infectivity. We propose that neutralizing antibodies against VP7 act 
by stabilizing the trimer, thereby inhibiting the uncoating trigger for VP4 
rearrangement. A disulfide-linked trimer is a potential subunit immunogen.
