Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma characterized by the 
chromosomal translocation t(11;14) that leads to constitutive expression of 
cyclin D1, a master regulator of the G1-S phase. Chk1 inhibitors have been 
recently shown to be strongly effective as single agents in MCL. To investigate 
molecular mechanisms at the basis of Chk1 inhibitor activity, a MCL cell line 
resistant to the Chk1 inhibitor PF-00477736 (JEKO-1 R) was obtained and 
characterized. The JEKO-1 R cell line was cross resistant to another Chk1 
inhibitor (AZD-7762) and to the Wee1 inhibitor MK-1775. It displayed a shorter 
doubling time than parental cell line, likely due to a faster S phase. Cyclin D1 
expression levels were decreased in resistant cell line and its 
re-overexpression partially re-established PF-00477736 sensitivity. Gene 
expression profiling showed an enrichment in gene sets involved in pro-survival 
pathways in JEKO-1 R. Dasatinib treatment partly restored PF-00477736 
sensitivity in resistant cells suggesting that the pharmacological interference 
of pro-survival pathways can overcome the resistance to Chk1 inhibitors. These 
data further corroborate the involvement of the t(11;14) in cellular sensitivity 
to Chk1 inhibitors, fostering the clinical testing of Chk1 inhibitors as single 
agents in MCL.
