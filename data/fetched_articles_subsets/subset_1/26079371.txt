K-Ras is a monomeric GTPase that controls cellular and tissue homeostasis. Prior 
studies demonstrated that mutationally activated K-Ras (K-Ras(G12D)) signals 
through MEK to promote expansion and hyperproliferation of the highly 
mitotically active transit-amplifying cells (TACs) in the intestinal crypt. Its 
effect on normally quiescent stem cells was unknown, however. Here, we have used 
an H2B-Egfp transgenic system to demonstrate that K-Ras(G12D) accelerates the 
proliferative kinetics of quiescent intestinal stem cells. As in the TAC 
compartment, the effect of mutant K-Ras on the quiescent stem cell is dependent 
upon activation of MEK. Mutant K-Ras is also able to increase self-renewal 
potential of intestinal stem cells following damage. These results demonstrate 
that mutant K-Ras can influence intestinal homeostasis on multiple levels.
