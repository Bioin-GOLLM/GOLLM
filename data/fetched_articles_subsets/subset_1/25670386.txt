Nitric oxide (NO) activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by binding its 
prosthetic heme group, thereby catalyzing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
synthesis. cGMP causes vasodilation and may inhibit smooth muscle cell 
proliferation and platelet aggregation. The NO-sGC-cGMP pathway is disordered in 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a syndrome in which pulmonary vascular 
obstruction, inflammation, thrombosis, and constriction ultimately lead to death 
from right heart failure. Expression of sGC is increased in PAH but its function 
is reduced by decreased NO bioavailability, sGC oxidation and the related loss 
of sGC's heme group. Two classes of sGC modulators offer promise in PAH. sGC 
stimulators (e.g., riociguat) require heme-containing sGC to catalyze cGMP 
production, whereas sGC activators (e.g., cinaciguat) activate heme-free sGC. 
Riociguat is approved for PAH and yields functional and hemodynamic benefits 
similar to other therapies. Its main serious adverse effect is dose-dependent 
hypotension. Riociguat is also approved for inoperable chronic thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension.
