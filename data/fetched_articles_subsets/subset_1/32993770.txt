BACKGROUND: Nematodirus battus, unlike most other gastrointestinal nematodes, 
undergoes maturation to an infective larva within the egg. Historically, eggs 
were considered to require a period of chilling over winter followed by a period 
of temperature above 10 °C for synchronous hatching to occur (generally in 
spring). Anecdotal reports of Nematodirus infection out-with spring in 
veterinary journals and the farming press suggest that the concentrated pasture 
abundance of N. battus infective larvae may be changing. In order for control 
practices to be adapted, and unexpected disease outbreaks to be avoided, it is 
important to quantify how parasite epidemiology is changing and research the 
drivers behind it.
METHOD: The present study investigated the in vitro hatching response to 
temperature experiences (with and without a period of chilling) for egg samples 
of 90 N. battus populations obtained from 73 commercial sheep farms. Six 
aliquots of larvated eggs were prepared per population, three aliquots were 
placed at 4 °C for 6  weeks to provide a chill stimulus then incubated at the 
optimal hatching temperature for the species. The remaining three aliquots of 
eggs were incubated at the hatching temperature without a prior chill stimulus 
and the number of hatched larvae was compared between treatments.
RESULTS: Median hatch rate across all populations with chilling was 45% (95% CI: 
42-48%) and without chilling was 4% (95% CI: 2-6%). Inter-population variation 
in hatching ranged from 0 to 87% of eggs able to hatch in the absence of a chill 
stimulus, mean non-chill hatching was 13 ± 2% of eggs (mean ± SE). Non-chill 
hatching rates were greater than chilled hatching rates in seven of the 90 
populations tested.
CONCLUSIONS: Clearly, the variation in hatching responses to temperature 
experience is very large and therefore the seasonality of the parasite may vary 
not only between regions but also at farm level. In contrast to what previous 
work has suggested, there was a geographical trend towards higher non-chill 
hatching in the Northern parts of the UK.
