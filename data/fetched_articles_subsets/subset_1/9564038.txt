Insulin stimulation of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human insulin 
receptor resulted in a time-dependent decrease in the amount of GTP bound to 
Rap1. The inactivation of Rap1 was associated with an insulin-stimulated 
decrease in the amount of Rap1 that was bound to Raf1. In parallel with the 
dissociation of Raf1 from Rap1, there was an increased association of Raf1 with 
Ras. Concomitant with the inactivation of Rap1 and decrease in Rap1-Raf1 
binding, we observed a rapid insulin-stimulated dissociation of the CrkII-C3G 
complex which occurred in a Ras-independent manner. The dissociation of the 
CrkII-C3G was recapitulated in vitro using a GST-C3G fusion protein to 
precipitate CrkII from whole cell detergent extracts. The association of GST-C3G 
with CrkII was also dose dependent and demonstrated that insulin reduced the 
affinity of CrkII for C3G without any effect on CrkII protein levels. 
Furthermore, the reduction in CrkII binding affinity was reversible by tyrosine 
dephosphorylation with PTP1B and by mutation of Tyr221 to phenylalanine. 
Together, these data demonstrate that insulin treatment results in the 
de-repression of Rap1 inhibitory function on the Raf1 kinase concomitant with 
Ras activation and stimulation of the downstream Raf1/MEK/ERK cascade.
