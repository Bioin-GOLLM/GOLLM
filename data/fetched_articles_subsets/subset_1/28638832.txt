The response of nutrient status and biochemical processes in (i) Wistar and (ii) 
spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats upon dietary intake of selenium- (Se-) 
enriched defatted rapeseed (DRS) and/or vitamin E fortification was examined to 
assess the health benefit of DRS in animal nutrition. Twenty-four individuals of 
each type of rat were used: The control group was fed with an untreated diet 
(Diet A). In Diets B and C, soybean meal was replaced with defatted DRS, which 
comprised 14% of the total diet. The selenized DRS application resulted in 
~3-fold increase of Se content in the diet. Diet C was also fortified with the 
addition of vitamin E, increasing the natural content by 30%. The Se content of 
the blood and kidneys tended to increase in the DRS groups, where the changes 
were significant (P < 0.05) only in the case of SHR rats. The iodine (I) content 
and the proportion of iodide in rat livers indicated a lower transformation rate 
of iodide into organoiodine compounds compared to the control. Slight and 
ambiguous alterations in the antioxidative response of the rat were observed in 
the DRS groups, but the addition of vitamin E to the diet helped to moderate 
these effects.
