RESULTS: All protein-based therapeutics, such as botulinum neurotoxin type A 
(BoNT/A), are potentially immunogenic and can lead to anaphylaxis, autoimmunity, 
or diminished or complete absence of therapeutic efficacy, especially if 
administered repeatedly. Therefore, the protein quantity in BoNT/A products is 
an important consideration when selecting products for treatment. However, 
essential formulation data are not always publicly accessible.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The neurotoxin protein content of products newly 
introduced in Asia, such as (listed alphabetically) Botulax®, Meditoxin®, 
Nabota®, and Relatox®, was measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay with antisera directed against BoNT/A compared to Xeomin®.
RESULTS: Compared to Xeomin with no inactive neurotoxin, although Botulax and 
Nabota contained 844 and 754 pg of neurotoxin protein, respectively, the 
percentage of inactive neurotoxin was calculated to be 103 and 81, respectively, 
while the potency per pg of neurotoxin was 0.118 and 0.133 U, respectively. 
Meditoxin and Relatox had 575 and 578 pg of neurotoxins, respectively, 
marginally higher than that of Xeomin, while the percentage of inactive 
neurotoxins was 38 and 33, respectively, and the potency per pg of neurotoxin 
was 0.174 and 0.173 U, respectively. However, Xeomin, which has 416 pg/vial of 
purified neurotoxin and 0.240 U of efficacy per pg of neurotoxin, has the lowest 
neurotoxin protein content and consequently the highest specific potency 
compared to the four Asian BoNT/A preparations in this study.
CONCLUSION: Although Botulax and Nabota had more neurotoxin than Xeomin in an 
equivalent volume, they contained greater amounts of inactive neurotoxin. In 
addition, although Meditoxin and Relatox had slightly more neurotoxin than 
Xeomin, both contained greater amounts of inactive neurotoxin.
