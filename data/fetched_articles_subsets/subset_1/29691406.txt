Human kallikrein peptidase 2 (hK2) is a prostate specific enzyme whose 
expression is governed by the androgen receptor (AR). AR is the central 
oncogenic driver of prostate cancer (PCa) and is also a key regulator of DNA 
repair in cancer. We report an innovative therapeutic strategy that exploits the 
hormone-DNA repair circuit to enable molecularly-specific alpha particle 
irradiation of PCa. Alpha-particle irradiation of PCa is prompted by molecularly 
specific-targeting and internalization of the humanized monoclonal antibody 
hu11B6 targeting hK2 and further accelerated by inherent DNA-repair that 
up-regulate hK2 (KLK2) expression in vivo. hu11B6 demonstrates exquisite 
targeting specificity for KLK2. A single administration of actinium-225 labeled 
hu11B6 eradicates disease and significantly prolongs survival in animal models. 
DNA damage arising from alpha particle irradiation induces AR and subsequently 
KLK2, generating a unique feed-forward mechanism, which increases binding of 
hu11B6. Imaging data in nonhuman primates support the possibility of utilizing 
hu11B6 in man.
