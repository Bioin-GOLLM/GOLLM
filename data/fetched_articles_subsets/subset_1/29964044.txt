Can virtual reality be useful for visualizing and analyzing molecular structures 
and three-dimensional (3D) microscopy? Uses we are exploring include studies of 
drug binding to proteins and the effects of mutations, building accurate atomic 
models in electron microscopy and x-ray density maps, understanding how immune 
system cells move using 3D light microscopy, and teaching schoolchildren about 
biomolecules that are the machinery of life. Virtual reality (VR) offers 
immersive display with a wide field of view and head tracking for better 
perception of molecular architectures and uses 6-degree-of-freedom hand 
controllers for simple manipulation of 3D data. Conventional computer displays 
with trackpad, mouse and keyboard excel at two-dimensional tasks such as writing 
and studying research literature, uses for which VR technology is at present far 
inferior. Adding VR to the conventional computing environment could improve 3D 
capabilities if new user-interface problems can be solved. We have developed 
three VR applications: ChimeraX for analyzing molecular structures and electron 
and light microscopy data, AltPDB for collaborative discussions around atomic 
models, and Molecular Zoo for teaching young students characteristics of 
biomolecules. Investigations over three decades have produced an extensive 
literature evaluating the potential of VR in research and education. Consumer VR 
headsets are now affordable to researchers and educators, allowing direct tests 
of whether the technology is valuable in these areas. We survey here advantages 
and disadvantages of VR for molecular biology in the context of affordable and 
dramatically more powerful VR and graphics hardware than has been available in 
the past.
