The outer retina is nourished from the choroid, a capillary bed just inside the 
sclera. O2, glucose, and other nutrients diffuse out of the choroid and then 
filter through a monolayer of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells to fuel the 
retina. Recent studies of energy metabolism have revealed striking differences 
between retinas and RPE cells in the ways that they extract energy from fuels. 
The purpose of this review is to suggest and evaluate the hypothesis that the 
retina and RPE have complementary metabolic roles that make them depend on each 
other for survival and for their abilities to perform essential and specialized 
functions.
