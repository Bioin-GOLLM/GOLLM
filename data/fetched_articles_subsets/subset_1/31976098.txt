A 45-year-old obese man presented with persistent hematuria for 21 years. At the 
age of 37, he developed hypertension and proteinuria which later increased up to 
1.6 g/g creatinine. Kidney biopsy revealed thin basement membrane nephropathy 
(TBMN) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which explained his 
urinary abnormalities. Although a subgroup of TBMN can be complicated by FSGS, 
his FSGS was associated with obesity because of its histological features. 
Reduction of body weight and increasing a dose of angiotensin-receptor blocker 
could transiently reduce the amount of proteinuria. Clinicopathological 
implications of proteinuria after long-term hematuria by TBMN and FSGS were 
further discussed.
