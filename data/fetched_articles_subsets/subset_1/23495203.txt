Dermatosparaxis Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (or EDS VIIC), a rare autosomal recessive 
connective tissue disorder, is characterized by extreme skin fragility, 
premature rupture of membranes in pregnancy, and spontaneous rupture of internal 
organs. Here we report a second patient with EDS VIIC presenting with congenital 
skull fractures and skin lacerations at birth, complications which may occur 
more frequently than previously thought in this condition. We also discuss the 
role of prenatal diagnosis in the management of a subsequent normal pregnancy.
