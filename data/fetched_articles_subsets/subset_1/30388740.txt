Common genetic variants of the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene are 
strongly associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. FTO is ubiquitously 
expressed. Earlier studies have focused on the role of hypothalamic FTO in the 
regulation of metabolism. However, recent studies suggest that expression of 
hepatic FTO is regulated by metabolic signals, such as nutrients and hormones, 
and altered FTO levels in the liver affect glucose and lipid metabolism. This 
review outlines recent findings on hepatic FTO in the regulation of metabolism, 
with particular focus on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. It is proposed 
that abnormal activity of hepatic signaling pathways involving FTO links 
metabolic impairments such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD). Therefore, a better understanding of these pathways may 
lead to therapeutic approaches to treat these metabolic diseases by targeting 
hepatic FTO. The overall goal of this review is to place FTO within the context 
of hepatic regulation of metabolism.
