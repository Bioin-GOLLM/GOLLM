OBJECTIVES: To describe a pharmacist-led diabetes prevention service piloted 
within an employer-based wellness program.
PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: A pharmacist-led ambulatory care clinic within a school of 
pharmacy that provides wellness services to university employees.
PRACTICE INNOVATION: Implementation of a diabetes prevention service using 
opportunistic A1C screening within a biometric screening program. Patients with 
a prediabetes-level A1C from July 2016 to March 2019 were invited to participate 
in the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP).
EVALUATION: Comparison of baseline characteristics of participants with normal 
and elevated A1C. Evaluation of participation in the NDPP and changes in 
clinical values at the subsequent biometric screening appointment for 
individuals with a prediabetes-level AlC.
RESULTS: A1C testing of 740 individuals identified 69 participants (9.3%) with a 
prediabetes-level A1C and 7 (1.0%) with a diabetes-level A1C. Compared with 
those with a normal A1C (< 5.7%), participants with an elevated A1C were more 
likely to be older, nonwhite, obese, and physically inactive, to have a sibling 
with diabetes, higher random blood sugar (RBS), lower high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL), and more likely to have hypertension. Twelve patients participated in the 
NDPP, although most attended only 1 session. Attenders had a significantly lower 
baseline weight and body mass index (BMI). There were no significant differences 
in the changes in A1C, BMI, weight, RBS, or HDL between attenders and 
nonattenders approximately 1 year later.
CONCLUSION: This pilot demonstrated that opportunistic A1C testing could be 
incorporated into an ambulatory care clinic within a pharmacist-led 
employer-based wellness program. Uptake and retention of the NDPP were poor. 
Barriers to NDPP participation need to be investigated and addressed to improve 
service impact.
