Upon binding to pathogen or self-derived cytosolic nucleic acids cyclic GMP-AMP 
synthase (cGAS) triggers the production of cGAMP that further activates 
transmembrane protein STING. Upon activation STING translocates from ER via 
Golgi to vesicles. Monogenic STING gain-of-function mutations cause early-onset 
type I interferonopathy, with disease presentation ranging from fatal 
vasculopathy to mild chilblain lupus. Molecular mechanisms underlying the 
variable phenotype-genotype correlation are presently unclear. Here, we report a 
novel gain-of-function G207E STING mutation causing a distinct phenotype with 
alopecia, photosensitivity, thyroid dysfunction, and features of 
STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), such as livedo 
reticularis, skin vasculitis, nasal septum perforation, facial erythema, and 
bacterial infections. Polymorphism in TMEM173 and IFIH1 showed variable 
penetrance in the affected family, implying contribution to varying phenotype 
spectrum. The G207E mutation constitutively activates inflammation-related 
pathways in vitro, and causes aberrant interferon signature and inflammasome 
activation in patient PBMCs. Treatment with Janus kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/2) 
inhibitor baricitinib was beneficiary for a vasculitic ulcer, induced hair 
regrowth and improved overall well-being in one patient. Protein-protein 
interactions propose impaired cellular trafficking of G207E mutant. These 
findings reveal the molecular landscape of STING and propose common 
polymorphisms in TMEM173 and IFIH1 as likely modifiers of the phenotype.
