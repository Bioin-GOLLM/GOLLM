USP4 is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family of 
deubiquitinating enzymes that has a role in spliceosome regulation. Here, we 
show that the crystal structure of the minimal catalytic domain of USP4 has the 
conserved USP-like fold with its typical ubiquitin-binding site. A 
ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain inserted into the catalytic domain has 
autoregulatory function. This Ubl domain can bind to the catalytic domain and 
compete with the ubiquitin substrate, partially inhibiting USP4 activity against 
different substrates. Interestingly, other USPs, such as USP39, could relieve 
this inhibition.
