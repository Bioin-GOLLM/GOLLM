Cancer immunotherapies have made major advancements in recent years and are 
becoming the prevalent treatment options for numerous tumor entities. However, 
substantial response rates have only been observed in specific subsets of 
patients since pre-existing factors determine the susceptibility of a tumor to 
these therapies. The development of approaches that can actively induce an 
anti-tumor immune response, such as adoptive cell transfer and oncolytic 
virotherapy, have shown clinical success in the treatment of leukemia and 
melanoma, respectively. Based on the immune-stimulatory capacity of oncolytic 
VSV-NDV virotherapy, we envisioned a combination approach to synergize with 
adoptive T cell transfer, in order to enhance tumor cell killing. Using the 
immune-competent B16 melanoma model, we demonstrate that combination treatment 
has beneficial effects on the suppressive microenvironment through upregulation 
of MHC-I and maintaining low expression levels of PD-L1 on tumor cells. The 
approach led to additive cytotoxic effects and improved the recruitment of T 
cells to virus-infected tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. We observed 
substantial delays in tumor growth and evidence of abscopal effects, as well as 
prolongation of overall survival time when administered at clinically relevant 
dosing conditions. Our results indicate that treatment with oncolytic VSV-NDV, 
combined with adoptive T cell therapy, induces multi-mechanistic and synergistic 
tumor responses, which supports the further development of this promising 
translational approach.
