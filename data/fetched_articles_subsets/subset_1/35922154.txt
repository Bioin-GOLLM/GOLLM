Cystic fibrosis is caused by genetic defects that impair the CFTR channel in 
airway epithelial cells. These defects may be overcome by specific CFTR 
modulating drugs, for which the efficacy can be predicted in a personalized 
manner using 3D nasal-brushing-derived airway organoids in a forskolin-induced 
swelling assay. Despite of this, previously described CFTR function assays in 3D 
airway organoids were not fully optimal, because of inefficient organoid 
differentiation and limited scalability. In this report, we therefore describe 
an alternative method of culturing nasal-brushing-derived airway organoids, 
which are created from an equally differentiated airway epithelial monolayer of 
a 2D air-liquid interface culture. In addition, we have defined organoid culture 
conditions, with the growth factor/cytokine combination 
neuregulin-1&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; and interleukin-1&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, which 
enabled consistent detection of CFTR modulator responses in nasal-airway 
organoid cultures from subjects with cystic fibrosis.
