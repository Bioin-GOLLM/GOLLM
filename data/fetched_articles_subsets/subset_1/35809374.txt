PURPOSE: Novel effective therapies are urgently needed in recurrent 
osteosarcoma. GD2 is expressed in human osteosarcoma tumours and cell lines. 
This study evaluated the disease control rate (DCR) in patients with recurrent 
osteosarcoma treated with the anti-GD2 antibody dinutuximab plus cytokine 
therapy as compared to historical outcomes.
METHODS: AOST1421 was a single-arm Phase 2 study for patients with recurrent 
pulmonary osteosarcoma in complete surgical remission. Patients received up to 
five cycles of dinutuximab (70 mg/m2/cycle) with granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Two different dinutuximab infusion schedules 
were studied: 35 mg/m2/day over 20 h (2 days) and 17.5 mg/m2/day over 10 h (4 
days). Primary end point was DCR, defined as a proportion of patients event free 
at 12 months from enrolment. The historical benchmark was 12-month DCR of 20% 
(95% CI 10-34%). Dinutuximab would be considered effective if ≥ 16/39 patients 
remained event free. Secondary objectives included toxicity evaluation and 
pharmacokinetics.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine eligible patients were included in the outcome analysis. 
Dinutuximab did not demonstrate evidence of efficacy as 11/39 patients remained 
event free for a DCR of 28.2% (95% CI 15-44.9%). One of 136 administered therapy 
cycles met criteria for unacceptable toxicity when a patient experienced sudden 
death of unknown cause. Other ≥ Grade 3 toxicities included pain, diarrhoea, 
hypoxia, and hypotension. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in the two 
schedules.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of dinutuximab with GM-CSF did not significantly 
improve DCR in recurrent osteosarcoma. Dinutuximab toxicity and pharmacokinetics 
in adolescent and young adult osteosarcoma patients were similar to younger 
patients. Other strategies for targeting GD2 in osteosarcoma are being 
developed.
