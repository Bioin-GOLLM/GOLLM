PURPOSE: To investigate the activation of three unfolded protein response (UPR) 
pathways in the lenses of age-related, high myopia-related and congenital 
cataracts.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Lens specimens were collected from patients during small 
incision cataract surgery. Lenses from young cadaver eyes were collected as 
normal controls. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect the 
expression of GRP78, p-eIF2α, spliced XBP1, ATF6, ATF4 and p-IRE1α in the lenses 
of normal human subjects and patients with age-related, myopia-related or 
congenital cataracts.
RESULTS: In the lenses of the age-related and high myopia-related cataract 
groups, the protein levels of ATF6, p-eIF2α and p-IRE1α and the gene expression 
levels of spliced XBP1, GRP78, ATF6 and ATF4 were greatly increased. 
Additionally, in the congenital cataract group, the protein levels of p-eIF2α 
and p-IRE1α and the gene expression levels of spliced XBP1, GRP78 and ATF4 were 
greatly increased. However, the protein and gene expression levels of ATF6 were 
not up-regulated in the congenital cataract group compared with the normal 
control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The UPR is activated via different pathways in the lenses of 
age-related, high myopia-related and congenital cataracts. UPR activation via 
distinct pathways might play important roles in cataractogenesis mechanisms in 
different types of cataracts.
