BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex disease and 
recently the role of DNA repairing genes in its susceptibility has been studied. 
It has been hypothesized that polymorphism in DNA repair system genes reduce the 
capacity to repair DNA damages which may lead to a greater susceptibility to 
AMD. C-reactive protein (CRP) production is shown to enhance inflammatory 
processes by increasing oxidative stress and inducing DNA damage. We planned to 
evaluate the possible association of SMUG1 variants and their possible 
interaction with high sensitivity CRP levels in AMD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 500 case-control samples consisting of 279 
advanced type AMD patients and 221 genetically unrelated healthy controls 
enrolled for evaluation. Extracted-DNA samples were amplified to obtain 
fragments including the polymorphic region SMUG1 rs3087404. We calculated 
relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion (AP), 
and synergy index (S) to clarify possible interaction of different genotypes and 
CRP levels for AMD.
RESULTS: The distribution of the genotypes were not significantly different in 
the AMD patients compared to that of controls (p = 0.849). The allele frequency 
for SMUG1 was not different between study groups. No difference of SMUG1 
polymorphism between case and control groups was evident in higher CRP levels 
(CRP>3mg/dl) compared with lower CRP levels. SMUG1/CRP synergy indices 
calculated as RERI = -0.12 and AP = -0.18 while S was not calculable.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that c.-31A/G-SMUG1 genotypes/alleles do not have 
any association with the occurrence or severity of advanced type AMD. There was 
no interaction of CRP levels and SMUG1 genotypes in AMD susceptibility.
