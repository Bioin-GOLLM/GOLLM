Capturing the full potential of human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived 
neurons in disease modeling and regenerative medicine requires analysis in 
complex functional systems. Here we establish optogenetic control in human 
PSC-derived spinal motorneurons and show that co-culture of these cells with 
human myoblast-derived skeletal muscle builds a functional all-human 
neuromuscular junction that can be triggered to twitch upon light stimulation. 
To model neuromuscular disease we incubated these co-cultures with IgG from 
myasthenia gravis patients and active complement. Myasthenia gravis is an 
autoimmune disorder that selectively targets neuromuscular junctions. We saw a 
reversible reduction in the amplitude of muscle contractions, representing a 
surrogate marker for the characteristic loss of muscle strength seen in this 
disease. The ability to recapitulate key aspects of disease pathology and its 
symptomatic treatment suggests that this neuromuscular junction assay has 
significant potential for modeling of neuromuscular disease and regeneration.
