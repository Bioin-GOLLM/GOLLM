We have previously identified a human receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase of 
the MAM domain family, termed PCP-2, in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells 
and found that this protein was colocalized with beta-catenin and E-cadherin at 
cell junctions [Wang, H.-Y., et al. (1996) Oncogene 12, 2555-2562]. Its 
intracellular part consists of two tandem phosphatase domains and a relatively 
large juxtamembrane region that is homologous to the conserved intracellular 
domain of cadherins, suggesting a role in the regulation of cell adhesion. This 
study reports that PCP-2 was endogenously expressed at the cell surface and 
upregulated with increased cell density. An in vivo binding assay revealed that 
PCP-2 could directly interact with beta-catenin through a region in the 
juxtamembrane domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin by EGF or active 
SrcY527F did not disrupt the formation of the PCP-2-beta-catenin complex, while 
PCP-2 in this complex could cause a significant reduction in the phosphorylation 
level in beta-catenin. Finally, we showed that PCP-2 was a negative regulator 
for cell migration. In conclusion, interaction of PCP-2 with its substrate 
beta-catenin is involved in the process of cell-cell contact.
