PURPOSE: Pravastatin sodium (PVS) is a hypolipidemic drug which suffers from 
extensive first-pass metabolism and short half-life. 
Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) is considered a promising carrier to 
improve its hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective activities.
METHODS: PVS-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (PVS-PLGA-NPs) were prepared by double 
emulsion method using a full 32 factorial design. The in vitro release and the 
physical stability studies of the optimized PVS-PLGA-NPs (F5) were performed. 
Finally, both hypolipidemic and hepatoprotective activities of the optimized F5 
NPs were studied and compared to PVS solution.
RESULTS: All the studied physical parameters of the prepared NPs were found in 
the accepted range. The particle size (PS) ranged from 90 ± 0.125 nm to 179.33 ± 
4.509 nm, the poly dispersity index (PDI) ranged from 0.121 ± 0.018 to 0.158 ± 
0.014. The optimized NPs (F5) have the highest entrapment efficiency (EE%) (51.7 
± 5%), reasonable PS (168.4 ± 2.506 nm) as well as reasonable zeta potential 
(ZP) (-28.3 ± 1.18mv). Solid-state characterization indicated that PVS is well 
entrapped into NPs. All NPs have distinct spherical shape with smooth surface. 
The prepared NPs showed a controlled release profile. F5 showed good stability 
at 4 ± 2°C during the whole storage period of 3 months. In vivo study and 
histopathological examination indicated that F5 NPs showed significant increase 
in PVS hypolipidemic as well as hepatoprotective activity compared to PVS 
solution.
CONCLUSION: The PVS-PLGA-NPs could be considered a promising model to evade the 
first-pass effect and showed improvement in the hypolipidemic and 
hepatoprotective activities compared to PVS solution.
