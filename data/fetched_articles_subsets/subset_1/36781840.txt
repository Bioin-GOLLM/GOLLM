FKBP51 plays a relevant role in sustaining cancer cells, particularly melanoma. 
This cochaperone participates in several signaling pathways. FKBP51 forms a 
complex with Akt and PHLPP, which is reported to dephosphorylate Akt. Given the 
recent discovery of a spliced FKBP51 isoform, in this paper, we interrogate the 
canonical and spliced isoforms in regulation of Akt activation. We show that the 
TPR domain of FKBP51 mediates Akt ubiquitination at K63, which is an essential 
step for Akt activation. The spliced FKBP51, lacking such domain, cannot link 
K63-Ub residues to Akt. Unexpectedly, PHLPP silencing does not foster 
phosphorylation of Akt, and its overexpression even induces phosphorylation of 
Akt. PHLPP stabilizes levels of E3-ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and supports 
K63-ubiquitination of Akt. The interactome profile of FKBP51 from melanoma cells 
highlights a relevant role for PHLPP in improving oncogenic hallmarks, 
particularly, cell proliferation.
