The paralogous human proteins UPF3A and UPF3B are involved in recognizing mRNAs 
targeted by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). UPF3B has been demonstrated to 
support NMD, presumably by bridging an exon junction complex (EJC) to the NMD 
factor UPF2. The role of UPF3A has been described either as a weak NMD activator 
or an NMD inhibitor. Here, we present a comprehensive functional analysis of 
UPF3A and UPF3B in human cells using combinatory experimental approaches. 
Overexpression or knockout of UPF3A as well as knockout of UPF3B did not 
substantially change global NMD activity. In contrast, the co-depletion of UPF3A 
and UPF3B resulted in a marked NMD inhibition and a transcriptome-wide 
upregulation of NMD substrates, demonstrating a functional redundancy between 
both NMD factors. In rescue experiments, UPF2 or EJC binding-deficient UPF3B 
largely retained NMD activity. However, combinations of different mutants, 
including deletion of the middle domain, showed additive or synergistic effects 
and therefore failed to maintain NMD. Collectively, UPF3A and UPF3B emerge as 
fault-tolerant, functionally redundant NMD activators in human cells.
