Familial lattice corneal dystrophy type I (LCD1) is a localized form of 
inherited amyloidosis limited to the corneal stroma. Recently the Finnish form 
of hereditary amyloidosis with lattice corneal dystrophy has been shown to be 
due to a mutation in the gelsolin gene (G654----A; Asp187----Asn). In this paper 
we exclude the gelsolin gene as the cause of the autosomal dominant form of 
isolated LCD1.
