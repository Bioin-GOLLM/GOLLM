Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated degradation pathway that enables the 
degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic components to sustain metabolic 
homoeostasis. Recently, autophagy has been reported to have an astonishing 
number of connections to cancer, as tumor cells require proficient autophagy in 
response to metabolic and therapeutic stresses to sustain cell proliferation. 
Autophagy-related gene 4 (ATG4) is essential for autophagy by affecting 
autophagosome formation through processing full-length microtubule-associated 
protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (pro-LC3) and lipidated LC3. An increasing amount of 
evidence suggests that ATG4B expression is elevated in certain types of cancer, 
implying that ATG4B is a potential anticancer target. In this review, we address 
the central roles of ATG4B in the autophagy machinery and in targeted cancer 
therapy. Specifically, we discuss how pharmacologically inhibiting ATG4B can 
benefit cancer therapies.
