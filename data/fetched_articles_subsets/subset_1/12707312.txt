The Aurora B kinase complex is a critical regulator of chromosome segregation 
and cytokinesis. In Caenorhabditis elegans, AIR-2 (Aurora B) function requires 
ICP-1 (Incenp) and BIR-1 (Survivin). In various systems, Aurora B binds to 
orthologues of these proteins. Through genetic analysis, we have identified a 
new subunit of the Aurora B kinase complex, CSC-1. C. elegans embryos depleted 
of CSC-1, AIR-2, ICP-1, or BIR-1 have identical phenotypes. CSC-1, BIR-1, and 
ICP-1 are interdependent for their localization, and all are required for AIR-2 
localization. In vitro, CSC-1 binds directly to BIR-1. The CSC-1/BIR-1 complex, 
but not the individual subunits, associates with ICP-1. CSC-1 associates with 
ICP-1, BIR-1, and AIR-2 in vivo. ICP-1 dramatically stimulates AIR-2 kinase 
activity. This activity is not stimulated by CSC-1/BIR-1, suggesting that these 
two subunits function as targeting subunits for AIR-2 kinase.
