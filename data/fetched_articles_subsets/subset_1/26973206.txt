OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have indicated that EGFR exon 19 deletions in 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are associated with better outcomes to 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) than the L858R mutation. This study aimed to 
evaluate whether T790M, a resistant mutation, is more likely to coexist with 
L858R mutation than with exon 19 deletions in pretreatment NSCLC patients.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE up to Nov 30th, 2015 to 
identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that 
reported pretreatment T790M and EGFR-activating mutation. A meta-analysis was 
performed using a random-effects model. The primary outcome was odds ratio (OR) 
of pretreatment T790M mutation in NSCLC co-existing with L858R mutation and exon 
19 deletions. Stratified analysis was performed based on sensitivity of mutation 
detection methods for T790M.
RESULTS: We identified 15 observational studies and 3 RCTs for analysis. 
Pretreatment T790M was more frequent in L858R than in exon 19 mutated patients. 
The association of T790M and L858R was statistically significant in 
observational studies (OR, 1.65, 95% CI, 1.17-2.32), with less precision in RCTs 
(OR, 1.84, 95% CI, 0.96-3.52). In the stratified analysis based on the 
sensitivity of the mutation detection methods, the association was observed in 
the studies using intermediately (detection limit <5% and ≥ 0.1%; OR, 2.23, 95% 
CI, 1.19-4.17) and highly sensitive methods (detection limit <0.1%; OR, 1.74, 
95% CI, 1.10-2.73), but not in those using low sensitivity methods (detection 
limit >5%; OR, 1.28, 95% CI, 0.74-2.23).
CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment EGFR T790M mutation is more likely to coexist with 
L858R mutation than with exon 19 deletions in NSCLC. This association was 
observed only in studies using sensitive mutation detection methods (<5%).
