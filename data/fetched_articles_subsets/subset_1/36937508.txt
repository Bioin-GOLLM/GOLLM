BACKGROUND: By 2020, the prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) 
in the US has reached 26. 6-43.2% in men and 8.7-27.8% in women. OSAS promotes 
hypertension, diabetes, and tumor growth through unknown means. Chronic 
intermittent hypoxia (CIH), sleep fragmentation, and increased pleural pressure 
are central mechanisms of OSAS complications. CIH exacerbates ferroptosis, which 
is closely related to malignancies. The mechanism of ferroptosis in OSAS disease 
progression remains unknown.
METHODS: OSAS-related datasets (GSE135917 and GSE38792) were obtained from the 
GEO. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using the R software 
and intersected with the ferroptosis database (FerrDb V2) to get 
ferroptosis-related DEGs (f-DEGs). GO, DO, KEGG, and GSEA enrichment were 
performed, a PPI network was constructed and hub genes were screened. The TCGA 
database was used to obtain the thyroid cancer (THCA) gene expression profile, 
and hub genes were analyzed for differential and survival analysis. The 
mechanism was investigated using GSEA and immune infiltration. The hub genes 
were validated with RT-qPCR, IHC, and other datasets. Sprague-Dawley rats were 
randomly separated into normoxia and CIH groups. ROS, MDA, and GSH methods were 
used to detect CIH-induced ferroptosis and oxidative stress.
RESULTS: GSEA revealed a statistically significant difference in ferroptosis in 
OSAS (FDR < 0.05). HIF1A, ATM, HSPA5, MAPK8, MAPK14, TLR4, and CREB1 were 
identified as hub genes among 3,144 DEGs and 74 f-DEGs. HIF1A and ATM were the 
only two validated genes. F-DEGs were mainly enriched in THCA. HIF1A 
overexpression in THCA promotes its development. HIF1A is associated with CD8 T 
cells and macrophages, which may affect the immunological milieu. The result 
found CIH increased ROS and MDA while lowering GSH indicating that it could 
cause ferroptosis. In OSAS patients, non-invasive ventilation did not affect 
HIF1A and ATM expression. Carvedilol, hydralazine, and caffeine may be important 
in the treatment of OSAS since they suppress HIF1A and ATM.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that the genes HIF1A and ATM are highly 
expressed in OSAS, and can serve as biomarkers and targets for OSAS.
