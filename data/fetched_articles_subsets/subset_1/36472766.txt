BACKGROUND: Nonsyndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss (DFNB) is an 
etiologically heterogeneous disorder group showing a wide spectrum of onset ages 
and severity. DFNB genes are very diverse in their types and functions, making 
molecular diagnosis difficult. DFNB is particularly frequent in Pakistan, which 
may be partly due to consanguinity.
OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to determine the genetic causes in Pakistani 
DFNB families with prelingual onset and to establish genotype-phenotype 
correlation.
METHODS: Whole exome sequencing and subsequent genetic analysis were performed 
for 11 Pakistani DFNB families including eight consanguineous families.
RESULTS: We identified eight pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in 
LOXHD1, GJB2, SLC26A4, MYO15A, and TMC1 from six families. The GJB2 mutations 
were identified in two families each with compound heterozygous mutations and a 
homozygous mutation. The compound heterozygous mutations in LOXHD1 ([p.D278Y] + 
[p.D1219E]) and GJB2 [p.M1?] + [p.G12Vfs*2]) were novel. The four missense or 
start-loss mutations were located at well conserved residues, and most in silico 
analysis predicted their pathogenicity. In addition to causative mutations, we 
found compound heterozygous mutations in PTPRQ as variants of uncertain 
significance.
CONCLUSION: This study identified biallelic mutations as the underlying cause of 
early onset DFNB in six Pakistani families. This study will be helpful in 
providing an exact molecular diagnosis and treatment of prelingual onset 
deafness patients.
