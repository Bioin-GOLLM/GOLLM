INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exacerbates intravascular 
thrombosis that occurs in the coronary artery in ST-elevation myocardial 
infarction (STEMI).
AIM: To analyze the impact of COVID-19 on the application and effect of 
thrombectomy in STEMI patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 29915 STEMI patients were analyzed, of whom 3139 (10.5%) 
underwent thrombectomy. COVID-19 (+) was reported in 311 (10.8%). The clinical 
characteristics and management of STEMI in COVID-19 (+) and COVID-19 (-) 
patients were compared. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was 
performed in search of factors influencing thrombectomy.
RESULTS: COVID-19 (+) patients had higher Killip class (IV class; n = 33 
(12.31%) vs. n = 138 (5.84%); p < 0.0001) and cardiac arrest at baseline was 
more frequent in this group (n = 25 (8.04%) vs. n = 137 (4.84%); p = 0.016). 
Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 after percutaneous coronary 
intervention was less frequent (n = 248 (80.52%) vs. n = 2388 (87.19%); p = 
0.001) in the COVID-19 (-) group. Periprocedural mortality was similar in both 
groups (n = 28 (0.99%) vs. n = 4 (1.29%); p = 0.622). In multivariable 
regression analysis COVID-19 increased the risk of thrombectomy (OR = 1.23; 
97.5% CI: 1.05-1.43; p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: STEMI patients undergoing aspiration thrombectomy who were COVID-19 
(+) were more likely to be in a severe clinical condition (higher Killip class, 
more frequent cardiac arrest before the procedure) than COVID-19 (-) patients. 
Despite more intensive antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment, PCI procedures 
were less likely to result in an optimal TIMI 3 effect. COVID-19 is an 
independent strong predictor of patient qualification for aspiration 
thrombectomy in STEMI.
