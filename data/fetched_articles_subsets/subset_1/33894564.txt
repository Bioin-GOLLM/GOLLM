Emerging and re-emerging viruses periodically cause outbreaks and epidemics all 
over the world, eventually leading to global events such as the current pandemic 
of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection COVID-19. Therefore, an urgent 
need for novel antivirals is crystal clear. Here we present the synthesis and 
evaluation of an antiviral activity of phenoxazine-based nucleoside analogs 
divided into three groups: (1) 8-alkoxy-substituted, (2) acyclic, and (3) 
carbocyclic. The antiviral activity was assessed against a structurally and 
phylogenetically diverse panel of RNA and DNA viruses from 25 species. Four 
compounds (11a-c, 12c) inhibited 4 DNA/RNA viruses with EC50 ≤ 20 μM. Toxicity 
of the compounds for the cell lines used for virus cultivation was negligible in 
most cases. In addition, previously reported and newly synthesized phenoxazine 
derivatives were evaluated against SARS-CoV-2, and some of them showed promising 
inhibition of reproduction with EC50 values in low micromolar range, although 
accompanied by commensurate cytotoxicity.
