After brain injury, neural stem cell-derived neuronal precursors (neuroblasts) 
in the ventricular-subventricular zone migrate toward the lesion. However, the 
ability of the mammalian brain to regenerate neuronal circuits for functional 
recovery is quite limited. Here, using a mouse model for ischemic stroke, we 
show that neuroblast migration is restricted by reactive astrocytes in and 
around the lesion. To migrate, the neuroblasts use Slit1-Robo2 signaling to 
disrupt the actin cytoskeleton in reactive astrocytes at the site of contact. 
Slit1-overexpressing neuroblasts transplanted into the poststroke brain migrated 
closer to the lesion than did control neuroblasts. These neuroblasts matured 
into striatal neurons and efficiently regenerated neuronal circuits, resulting 
in functional recovery in the poststroke mice. These results suggest that the 
positioning of new neurons will be critical for functional neuronal regeneration 
in stem/progenitor cell-based therapies for brain injury.
