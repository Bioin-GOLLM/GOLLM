Curli are functional amyloids present on the outer membrane of E. coli. CsgF is 
required for the proper assembly of curli. Here, we found that the CsgF phase 
separates in vitro and that the ability of CsgF variants to phase-separate is 
tightly correlated with CsgF function during curli biogenesis. Substitution of 
phenylalanine residues in the CsgF N-terminus both reduced the propensity of 
CsgF to phase-separate and impaired curli assembly. Exogenous addition of 
purified CsgF complemented csgF - cells. This exogenous addition assay was used 
to assess the ability of CsgF variants to complement csgF ‒ cells. CsgF on the 
cell surface modulated the secretion of CsgA, the curli major subunit, to the 
cell surface. We also found that the CsgB nucleator protein can form 
SDS-insoluble aggregates within the dynamic CsgF condensate. We propose that 
these multicomponent CsgF-B condensates form a nucleation-competent complex that 
templates CsgA amyloid formation on the cell surface.
