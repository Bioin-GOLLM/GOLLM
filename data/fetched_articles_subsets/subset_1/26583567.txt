Recent strategies for treating CML patients have focused on investigating new 
combinations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as well as identifying novel 
translational research agents that can eradicate CML leukemia-initiating cells 
(CML-LICs). However, little is known about the therapeutic benefits such CML-LIC 
targeting therapies might bring to CML patients. In this study, we investigated 
the therapeutic potential of EW-7197, an orally bioavailable transforming growth 
factor-β signaling inhibitor which has recently been approved as an 
Investigational New Drug (NIH, USA), to suppress CML-LICs in vivo. Compared to 
TKI treatment alone, administration of TKI plus EW-7197 to CML-affected mice 
significantly delayed disease relapse and prolonged survival. Notably, combined 
treatment with EW-7197 plus TKI was effective in eliminating CML-LICs even if 
they expressed the TKI-resistant T315I mutant BCR-ABL1 oncogene. Collectively, 
these results indicate that EW-7197 may be a promising candidate for a new 
therapeutic that can greatly benefit CML patients by working in combination with 
TKIs to eradicate CML-LICs.
