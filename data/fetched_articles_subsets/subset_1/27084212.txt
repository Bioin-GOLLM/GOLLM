Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may develop several non-motor symptoms 
such as psychosis, depression, cognitive impairment, autonomic disturbances and 
sleep disturbances. Psychosis is one of the common non-motor symptoms, which 
commonly manifests as visual hallucinations and minor hallucinations such as 
sense of passage and presence. Though long-term dopaminergic therapy, longer 
duration of PD and cognitive impairment have been described as risk factors for 
emergence of psychosis in PD, predicting psychosis in PD remains challenging. 
Multiple studies have explored the genetic basis of psychosis in PD by studying 
polymorphisms of several genes. Most of the studies have focused on 
apolipoprotein E polymorphism followed by polymorphisms in cholecystokinin (CCK) 
system, dopamine receptors and transporters, HOMER gene, serotonin, 
catechol-o-methyltransferase, angiotensin converting enzyme and tau. Other than 
the studies on polymorphisms of CCK, most of the studies have reported 
conflicting results regarding association with psychosis in PD. Three out of 
four studies on CCK polymorphism have reported significant association of -45C>T 
polymorphism with the presence of hallucinations. The discrepancies in the 
results across the studies reviewed are possibly due to racial differences as 
well as differences in the patient characteristics. This review critically 
analyzes the published studies on genetic polymorphisms in patients with PD and 
psychosis.
