BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hereditary spastic paraplegia is a clinically and 
genetically heterogeneous group of rare, inherited disorders causing an upper 
motor neuron syndrome with (complex) or without (pure) additional neurological 
symptoms. Mutations in the KIF1A gene have already been associated with 
recessive and dominant forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG30) in a few 
cases.
METHODS: All family members included in the study were examined neurologically. 
Whole-exome sequencing was used in affected individuals to identify the 
responsible candidate gene. Conventional Sanger sequencing was conducted to 
validate familial segregation.
RESULTS: A family of Macedonian origin with two affected siblings, one with 
slowly progressive and the other one with a more complex and rapidly progressing 
hereditary spastic paraplegia is reported. In both affected individuals, two 
novel pathogenic mutations outside the motor domain of the KIF1A gene were found 
(NM_001244008.1:c.2909G>A, p.Arg970His and c.1214dup, p.Asn405Lysfs*40) that 
segregate with the disease within the family establishing the diagnosis of 
autosomal recessive SPG30.
CONCLUSIONS: This report provides the first evidence that mutations outside the 
motor domain of the gene can cause (recessive) SPG30 and extends the 
genotype-phenotype association for KIF1A-related diseases.
