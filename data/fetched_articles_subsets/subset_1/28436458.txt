African swine fever is a contagious and often lethal disease for domestic pigs 
with a significant economic impact for the swine industry. The etiological 
agent, African swine fever virus (ASFV), is a highly structurally complex double 
stranded DNA virus. No effective vaccines or antiviral treatment are currently 
commercially available. We present here the development of a strain of ASFV that 
has been shown to retain its ability to cause disease in swine, efficiently 
replicate in swine macrophage and that is fluorescently tagged. The insertion of 
an EGFP cassette replacing the reading frames for two neighboring genes, 
MGF360-13L and MGF360-14L, in highly virulent field isolate Georgia/2007, did 
not affect virus replication in cell cultures and did not affect disease 
progression in swine, the natural host for ASFV. A virulent fluorescently tagged 
ASFV is a suitable tool to conduct pathogenesis studies in swine, study on 
virus-macrophage interaction and to run large scale screens that require a 
sensitive high throughput output. Utilizing an EGFP reporter system for 
observing ASFV replication and infectivity can circumvent the time and 
labor-intensive steps associated with viral antigen-based assays such as the 
observation of hemadsorption or cytopathic effect.
