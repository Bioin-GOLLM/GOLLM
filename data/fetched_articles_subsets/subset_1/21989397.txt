We analyzed the mutations identified in a family affected by Maturity-Onset 
Diabetes of the Young (MODY3), and searched for correlations between the 
genotype and clinical manifestations of diabetes. In 4 of 9 subjects we have 
demonstrated a heterozygous missense mutation in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 
alfa (HNF1α). The missense mutation, caused by a G>A transition at nucleotide 
815 of exon 4 (c.815G>A), resulted in the substitution of arginine with 
histidine at codon 272 (p.Arg272His). This mutation occurs in the DNA binding 
domain of HNF1α. Heterogenity of clinical characteristic in patients was 
evident. Variability in age of onset, presence of obesity and evolution time was 
present. In conclusion, clinical presentation of diabetes is otherwise atipical 
for the assumed etiology. Thus, the diagnosis of MODY should be raised in 
various clinical circumstances. Molecular diagnosis has important consequences 
in terms of prognosis, family screening, and therapy.
