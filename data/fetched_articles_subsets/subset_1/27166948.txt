The mitochondrial inner membrane harbors three protein translocases. Presequence 
translocase and carrier translocase are essential for importing nuclear-encoded 
proteins. The oxidase assembly (OXA) translocase is required for exporting 
mitochondrial-encoded proteins; however, different views exist about its 
relevance for nuclear-encoded proteins. We report that OXA plays a dual role in 
the biogenesis of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. First, a systematic 
analysis of OXA-deficient mitochondria led to an unexpected expansion of the 
spectrum of OXA substrates imported via the presequence pathway. Second, 
biogenesis of numerous metabolite carriers depends on OXA, although they are not 
imported by the presequence pathway. We show that OXA is crucial for the 
biogenesis of the Tim18-Sdh3 module of the carrier translocase. The export 
translocase OXA is thus required for the import of metabolite carriers by 
promoting assembly of the carrier translocase. We conclude that OXA is of 
central importance for the biogenesis of the mitochondrial inner membrane.
