This study aimed to determine the prevalence of postpartum metabolic syndrome 
(MetS), glucose intolerance,<br />and the determinants, 6-12 weeks postpartum in 
women with assisted reproduction technology conception<br />gestational diabetes 
mellitus diagnosis (ART-GDM) compared to women with spontaneous conception and 
GDM<br />diagnosis (SC-GDM).<br />Materials and Methods: In this prospective 
cohort study, two groups consisting of 62 ART-GDM and 64 SC-GDM<br />singleton 
pregnant women were followed 6-12 weeks after delivery for postpartum MetS. 
Fasting glucose, 75-g 2-h<br />OGTT, and lipid profile were assessed. Waist and 
hip circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP)<br />were 
measured at postpartum. Clinical, paraclinical, and obstetric data were recorded 
from registry offices. The prevalence<br />of MetS and glucose intolerance were 
determined. Predictors of MetS and glucose intolerance were evaluated<br />by 
logistic regression.<br />Results: The prevalence of postpartum MetS was 20.8% 
in ART-GDM women and 10.9% in SC-GDM (P=0.123).<br />Mean postpartum BMI and 
systolic BP were significantly higher in the ART-GDM group (P=0.016 and 
P=0.027<br />respectively). Adverse pregnancy outcomes were significantly higher 
in the ART-GDM group. Postpartum glucose<br />intolerance prevalence did not 
vary significantly between the groups. Family history of diabetes was a 
predictive factor<br />for postpartum MetS and glucose intolerance 6-12 weeks 
after delivery.<br />Conclusion: Early postpartum MetS and glucose intolerance 
prevalence after assisted conception did not vary significantly;<br />however, 
postpartum body mass index (BMI) and systolic BP were significantly higher in 
the ART-GDM group.<br />Lifestyle modification programs and long-term health 
care of ART women with GDM diagnosis can be recommended.<br />Further studies 
with larger sample size and longer follow-up are necessary to verify our 
findings.
