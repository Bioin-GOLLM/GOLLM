The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) regulates the flux of metabolites and 
ions across the outer mitochondrial membrane. Regulation of ion flow involves 
conformational transitions in VDAC, but the nature of these changes has not been 
resolved to date. By combining single-molecule force spectroscopy with nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy we show that the β barrel of human VDAC embedded 
into a membrane is highly flexible. Its mechanical flexibility exceeds by up to 
one order of magnitude that determined for β strands of other membrane proteins 
and is largest in the N-terminal part of the β barrel. Interaction with Ca(2+), 
a key regulator of metabolism and apoptosis, considerably decreases the barrel's 
conformational variability and kinetic free energy in the membrane. The combined 
data suggest that physiological VDAC function depends on the molecular 
plasticity of its channel.
