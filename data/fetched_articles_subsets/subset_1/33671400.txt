Defects in the mitochondrial genome (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)) are associated 
with both congenital and acquired disorders in humans. Nuclear-encoded DNA 
polymerase subunit gamma (POLG) plays an important role in mtDNA replication, 
and proofreading and mutations in POLG have been linked with increased mtDNA 
deletions. SSBP1 is also a crucial gene for mtDNA replication. Here, we describe 
a patient diagnosed with Pearson syndrome with large mtDNA deletions that were 
not detected in the somatic cells of the mother. Exome sequencing was used to 
evaluate the nuclear factors associated with the patient and his family, which 
revealed a paternal POLG mutation (c.868C > T) and a maternal SSBP1 mutation 
(c.320G > A). The patient showed lower POLG and SSBP1 expression than his 
healthy brothers and the general population of a similar age. Notably, c.868C in 
the wild-type allele was highly methylated in the patient compared to the same 
site in both his healthy brothers. These results suggest that the co- deficient 
expression of POLG and SSBP1 genes could contribute to the development of mtDNA 
deletion.
