BACKGROUND: Cerebral ischemic stroke is one of the severe diseases with a 
pathological condition that leads to nerve cell dysfunction with seldom 
available therapy options. Currently, there are few proven effective treatments 
available for improving cerebral ischemic stroke outcome. However, recently, 
there is increasing evidence that inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
activity exerts a strong protective effect in in vivo and vitro models of 
ischemic stroke. Review Summary. HDAC is a posttranslational modification that 
is negatively regulated by histone acetyltransferase (HATS) and histone 
deacetylase. Based on function and DNA sequence similarity, histone deacetylases 
(HDACs) are organized into four different subclasses (I-IV). Modifications of 
histones play a crucial role in cerebral ischemic affair development after 
translation by modulating disrupted acetylation homeostasis. HDAC inhibitors 
(HDACi) mainly exert neuroprotective effects by enhancing histone and nonhistone 
acetylation levels and enhancing gene expression and protein modification 
functions. This article reviews HDAC and its inhibitors, hoping to find 
meaningful therapeutic targets.
CONCLUSIONS: HDAC may be a new biological target for cerebral ischemic stroke. 
Future drug development targeting HDAC may make it a potentially effective 
anticerebral ischemic stroke drug.
