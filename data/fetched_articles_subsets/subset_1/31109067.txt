Cytokinesis is the last stage of cell division, which partitions the mother cell 
into two daughter cells. It requires the assembly and constriction of a 
contractile ring that consists of a filamentous contractile network of actin and 
myosin. Network contractility depends on network architecture, level of 
connectivity and myosin motor activity, but how exactly is the contractile ring 
network organized or interconnected and how much it depends on motor activity 
remains unclear. Moreover, the contractile ring is not an isolated entity; 
rather, it is integrated into the surrounding cortex. Therefore, the mechanical 
properties of the cell cortex and cortical behaviors are expected to impact 
contractile ring functioning. Due to the complexity of the process, experimental 
approaches have been coupled to theoretical modeling in order to advance its 
global understanding. While earlier coarse-grained descriptions attempted to 
provide an integrated view of the process, recent models have mostly focused on 
understanding the behavior of an isolated contractile ring. Here we provide an 
overview of the organization and dynamics of the actomyosin network during 
cytokinesis and discuss existing theoretical models in light of cortical 
behaviors and experimental evidence from several systems. Our view on what is 
missing in current models and should be tested in the future is provided.
