HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells leads to cytopathic effects and cell demise, 
which is counter to the observation that certain HIV-1-infected cells possess a 
remarkable long-term stability and can persist lifelong in infected individuals 
treated with suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Using quantitative mass 
spectrometry-based proteomics, we showed that HIV-1 infection activated cellular 
survival programs that were governed by BIRC5, a molecular inhibitor of cell 
apoptosis that is frequently overexpressed in malignant cells. BIRC5 and its 
upstream regulator OX40 were upregulated in productively and latently infected 
CD4+ T cells and were functionally involved in maintaining their viability. 
Moreover, OX40-expressing CD4+ T cells from ART-treated patients were enriched 
for clonally expanded HIV-1 sequences, and pharmacological inhibition of BIRC5 
resulted in a selective decrease of HIV-1-infected cells in vitro. Together, 
these findings suggest that BIRC5 supports long-term survival of HIV-1-infected 
cells and may lead to clinical strategies to reduce persisting viral reservoirs.
