OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is caused by a complex interplay among genetic, 
microbial and environmental factors. ATG16L1 is an important genetic factor 
involved in innate immunity, including autophagy and phagocytosis of microbial 
components from the gut. We investigated the effect of inflammation on the 
composition of microbiota in the ileal mucosa of CD patients in relation to the 
ATG16L1 risk status.
DESIGN: Biopsies (n=35) were obtained from inflamed and non-inflamed regions of 
the terminal ileum of 11 CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele 
(ATG16L1-T300A) and 9 CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective allele 
(ATG16L1-T300). Biopsy DNA was extracted and the bacterial composition analysed 
by pyrosequencing. Intracellular survival rates of adherent-invasive Escherichia 
coli (AIEC) were analysed by determining colony forming units after exposure to 
monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk or 
protective allele.
RESULTS: Inflamed ileal tissue from patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk 
allele contained increased numbers of Fusobacteriaceae, whereas inflamed ileal 
tissue of patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective allele showed decreased 
numbers of Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and increased Lachnospiraceae. 
The ATG16L1 allele did not affect the bacterial composition in the non-inflamed 
ileal tissue. Monocytes homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele showed impaired 
killing of AIEC under inflammatory conditions compared with those homozygous for 
the ATG16L1 protective allele.
CONCLUSIONS: CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1-T300A risk allele show 
impaired clearance of pathosymbionts in ileal inflammation indicating that 
ATG16L1 is essential for effective elimination of pathosymbionts upon 
inflammation.
