Many viruses exploit host-cell Ca2+ signaling processes throughout their life 
cycle. This is especially relevant for viruses that translocate through the 
endolysosomal system, where cellular infection is keyed to the microenvironment 
of these acidic Ca2+ stores and Ca2+-dependent trafficking pathways. As 
regulators of the endolysosomal ionic milieu and trafficking dynamics, two 
families of endolysosomal Ca2+-permeable cation channels - two pore channels 
(TPCs) and transient receptor potential mucolipins (TRPMLs) - have emerged as 
important host-cell factors in viral entry. Here, we review: (i) current 
evidence implicating Ca2+ signaling in viral translocation through the 
endolysosomal system, (ii) the roles of these ion channels in supporting 
cellular infection by different viruses, and (iii) areas for future research 
that will help define the potential of TPC and TRPML ligands as progressible 
antiviral agents.
