Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) protects cells from apoptosis primarily 
through the action of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and the downstream 
serine/threonine kinase Akt. The PTEN gene product, a protein which 
dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol lipids, prevents activation of Akt and 
regulates several cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, cell 
migration, and survival from apoptosis. In this study, PTEN overexpression 
decreases IGF-I-induced Akt activity, enhances serum withdrawal-induced 
apoptosis, and decreases IGF-I protection and cell growth in SHEP cells. The 
PTEN lipid phosphatase mutant G129E fails to inhibit IGF-I-stimulated Akt 
activity and protection from apoptosis. The C124S mutation, which abolishes both 
lipid and protein phosphatase activity, fails to inhibit Akt activity and IGF-I 
protection against hyperosmotic-induced apoptosis but still inhibits growth and 
IGF-I protection against serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis. These data suggest 
a role for PTEN in modulating the effect of IGF-I on Akt activity, neuroblastoma 
cell growth, and protection against apoptotic stimuli.
