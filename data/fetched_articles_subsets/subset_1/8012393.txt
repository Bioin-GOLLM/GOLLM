Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is an autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by blister formation within the dermal-epidermal basement 
membrane. Genes for the lamina lucida protein, kalinin/laminin 5, have been 
proposed as candidates for some forms of JEB, based on immunofluorescence 
analysis recognizing kalinin epitopes. We studied the cDNA of laminin gamma 2 
chain for mutations in JEB using heteroduplex analysis. One patient showed a 
homozygous splice site mutation while another was heterozygous for a 
deletion-insertion, resulting in a premature termination codon in one allele. 
Our data implicate mutations in the laminin gamma 2 chain gene (LAMC2) in some 
forms of JEB.
