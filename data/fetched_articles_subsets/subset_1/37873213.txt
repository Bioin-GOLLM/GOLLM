Most cellular ubiquitin signaling is initiated by UBA1, which activates and 
transfers ubiquitin to tens of E2 enzymes. Clonally acquired UBA1 missense 
mutations cause an inflammatory-hematologic overlap disease called VEXAS 
(vacuoles, E1, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome. Despite extensive 
clinical investigation into this lethal disease, little is known about the 
underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, by dissecting VEXAS-causing UBA1 
mutations, we discovered that p.Met41 mutations alter cytoplasmic isoform 
expression, whereas other mutations reduce catalytic activity of nuclear and 
cytoplasmic isoforms by diverse mechanisms, including aberrant oxyester 
formation. Strikingly, non-p.Met41 mutations most prominently affect 
transthioesterification, revealing ubiquitin transfer to cytoplasmic E2 enzymes 
as a shared property of pathogenesis amongst different VEXAS syndrome genotypes. 
A similar E2 charging bottleneck exists in some lung cancer-associated UBA1 
mutations, but not in spinal muscular atrophy-causing UBA1 mutations, which 
instead, render UBA1 thermolabile. Collectively, our results highlight the 
precision of conformational changes required for faithful ubiquitin transfer, 
define distinct and shared mechanisms of UBA1 inactivation in diverse diseases, 
and suggest that specific E1-E2 modules control different aspects of tissue 
differentiation and maintenance.
