Bisphenol A (BPA) has emerged as a contaminant of concern because long-term 
exposure may affect the human endocrine system. Herein, a novel aptamer sensor 
based on magnetic separation and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is 
proposed for the extremely sensitive and specific detection of trace BPA. 
Moreover, the capture unit was prepared by immobilizing thiolated (SH)-BPA 
aptamer complementary DNA on AuNP-coated magnetic halloysite nanotubes 
(MNTs@AuNPs), and SH-BPA aptamer-modified Au@4-MBA@Ag core-shell SERS nanotags 
acted as signal units. By the complementary pairing of the BPA aptamer and the 
corresponding DNA, MNTs@AuNPs and Au@4-MBA@AgCS were linked together through 
hybridization-ligation, which acted as the SERS substrate. In the absence of 
BPA, the constructed aptamer sensor generated electromagnetic enhancement and 
plasmon coupling to improve the sensitivity of SERS substrates. Owing to the 
high affinity between BPA and the aptamer, the aptamer probe bound to BPA was 
separated from the capture unit by an externally-induced magnetic field. Thus, 
the Raman intensity of the MNTs@AuNP-Ag@AuCS core-satellite assemblies was 
negatively correlated with the BPA concentration. High sensitivity measurements 
of BPA might be performed by determining the decline in SERS signal strength 
together with concentration variations. The proposed aptasensor is a promising 
biosensing platform for BPA detection.
