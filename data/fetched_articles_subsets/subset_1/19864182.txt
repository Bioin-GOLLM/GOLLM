Avian influenza A H5N1 remains unusual in its virulence for humans. Although 
infection of humans remains inefficient, many of those with H5N1 disease have a 
rapidly progressing viral pneumonia that leads to acute respiratory distress 
syndrome and death, but its pathogenesis remains an enigma. Comparison of the 
virology and pathogenesis of human seasonal influenza viruses (H3N2 and H1N1) 
and H5N1 in patients, animal models and relevant primary human cell cultures is 
instructive. Although the direct effects of viral replication and differences in 
the tropism of the virus for cells in the lower respiratory tract clearly 
contribute to pathogenesis, we focus here on the possible contribution of the 
host innate immune response in the pathogenesis of this disease.
