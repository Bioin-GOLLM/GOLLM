OBJECTIVE: While it has been claimed that lung cancer occurs due to epigenetic 
mechanisms, four systematic reviews were reported to investigate the association 
between serum folate levels and lung cancer risk. Considering some 
methodological problems founded in the systematic review, a meta-epidemiological 
study was conducted.
METHODS: The selection criteria of this study were defined that a case-control 
study was conducted to determine the risk of lung cancer occurrence according to 
the concentration of serum folate and its results showed odds ratio and its 95% 
confidence interval. Additional paper was explored from cited lists of 4 papers 
selected by previous systematic reviews. Random effect model was applied if 
I-squared value was over 50%.
RESULTS: For 5 case-control studies selected, the summary odds ratios (and their 
95% confidence intervals) were 0.82 (0.74-0.90) in men, 0.70 (0.62-0.79) in 
former smokers, and 0.86 (0.75-1.00) in non-smokers.
CONCLUSION: Higher foliate levels can decrease lung cancer risk in men and 
former smokers. Especially, the protective effect was highest in former smokers 
compared in non-smokers and current smokers. Based on these facts, folate 
fortification programs to reduce lung cancer risk would be focused on former 
smokers in men. And some epidemiological studies are needed to provide a 
hypothesis to explain the sex differences in the association between folate and 
lung cancer risk.
