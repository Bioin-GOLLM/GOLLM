The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) tumor suppressor is inactivated in different 
leukemias through the activity of its endogenous inhibitors (e.g., SET), which 
are aberrantly regulated by oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Like other effective and 
nontoxic PP2A-activating drugs (PAD), OP449 inhibits SET and impairs 
leukemogenesis. This further supports the immediate use of PADs in patients with 
leukemia.
