BACKGROUND: The genetic inter-individual variability of drug response can lead 
to therapeutic failure or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The aims of this study 
were to assess the pharmacogenetic profile of a South Portuguese population 
according to established dosing guidelines for commonly prescribed drugs and to 
compare it with that of previously genotyped populations.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was developed in the context of the Portuguese 
Component of the European Health Examination Survey (EHES). A total of 47 
pharmacogenetically relevant variants in 23 different genes were genotyped in 
208 participants. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were calculated, and the 
pharmacogenetic profile of the participants was defined. A comparative analysis 
was conducted through electronic database search. Pairwise Fst calculations were 
performed to assess the genetic distance between populations.
RESULTS: We found a significant small differentiation between the Portuguese 
regional populations regarding CYP2C9 rs1057910, CYP2D6 rs3892097, MTHFR 
rs1801133 and F5 rs6025. When consid-ering 4 HapMap populations, ADH1B 
rs2066702, ADH1B rs1229984, NAT2 rs1799931 and VKORC1 rs9923231 displayed a 
significant population differentiation. We found that 18.9% of the participants 
are intermediate or poor metabolizers for at least 3 drugs simultaneously and 
that 84.6% of the participants have at least one therapeutic failure or ADR risk 
allele for the considered drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of risk alleles associated with an 
altered drug metabolism regarding drugs largely used by the South Portuguese 
population. This knowledge contributes to the prediction of their clinical 
efficacy and/or toxicity, optimizing therapeutic response while improving 
cost-effectiveness.
