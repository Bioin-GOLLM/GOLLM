Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has provided a method for 
visualizing prostate cancer. MRI-ultrasonography fusion allows prostate biopsy 
to be performed quickly, on an outpatient basis, using the transrectal 
technique. Targeted biopsies are more sensitive for detection of prostate cancer 
than nontargeted, systematic biopsies and detect more significant prostate 
cancers and fewer insignificant cancers than conventional biopsies. A negative 
MRI scan should not defer biopsy. Two groups who will especially benefit from 
targeted prostate biopsy are men with low-risk lesions in active surveillance 
and men with increased prostate-specific antigen levels and previous negative 
conventional biopsies.
