Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and cognitive function 
impairment. The multi-faced character of AD requires new drug solutions based on 
substances that incorporate a wide range of activities. Antioxidants, AChE/BChE 
inhibitors, BACE1, or anti-amyloid platelet aggregation substances are most 
desirable because they improve cognition with minimal side effects. Plant 
secondary metabolites, used in traditional medicine and pharmacy, are promising. 
Among these are the monoterpenes-low-molecular compounds with anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, analgesic, sedative, as well as other biological 
properties. The presented review focuses on the pathophysiology of AD and a 
selected group of anti-neurodegenerative monoterpenes and monoterpenoids for 
which possible mechanisms of action have been explained. The main body of the 
article focuses on monoterpenes that have shown improved memory and learning, 
anxiolytic and sleep-regulating effects as determined by in vitro and in silico 
tests-followed by validation in in vivo models.
