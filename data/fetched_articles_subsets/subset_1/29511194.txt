Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease, and valve 
replacement is the only definitive treatment. Here we report a large genome-wide 
association (GWA) study of 2,457 Icelandic AS cases and 349,342 controls with a 
follow-up in up to 4,850 cases and 451,731 controls of European ancestry. We 
identify two new AS loci, on chromosome 1p21 near PALMD (rs7543130; odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.20, P = 1.2 × 10-22) and on chromosome 2q22 in TEX41 (rs1830321; 
OR = 1.15, P = 1.8 × 10-13). Rs7543130 also associates with bicuspid aortic 
valve (BAV) (OR = 1.28, P = 6.6 × 10-10) and aortic root diameter 
(P = 1.30 × 10-8), and rs1830321 associates with BAV (OR = 1.12, P = 5.3 × 10-3) 
and coronary artery disease (OR = 1.05, P = 9.3 × 10-5). The results implicate 
both cardiac developmental abnormalities and atherosclerosis-like processes in 
the pathogenesis of AS. We show that several pathways are shared by CAD and AS. 
Causal analysis suggests that the shared risk factors of Lp(a) and 
non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol contribute substantially to the 
frequent co-occurence of these diseases.
