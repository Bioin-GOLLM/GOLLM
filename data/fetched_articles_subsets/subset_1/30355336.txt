BACKGROUND: The H6N1 subtype of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) can infect people 
with an influenza-like illness; the H6N1 viruses possess the ability for 
zoonotic transmission from avians into mammals, and possibly pose a threat to 
human health.
METHODS: In 2017, live poultry markets (LPMs) in Zhejiang Province were surveyed 
for AIVs. To better understand the genetic relationships between these strains 
from Eastern China and other AIVs, all gene segments of these strains were 
sequenced and compared with sequences available in GenBank. In this study, we 
analyzed the receptor-binding specificity, antigenic characteristics, and 
pathogenicity of these two H6N1 viruses.
RESULTS: In 2017, two H6N1 AIVs were isolated from chickens during surveillance 
for AIVs in LPMs in Eastern China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these 
strains shared genetic characteristics from H6, H10, H1, and H4 AIVs found in 
ducks and wild birds in East Asia. These AIV strains were able to replicate in 
mice without prior adaptation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we report the discovery of new strains of H6N1 
viruses from chickens with novel gene reassortments. Our results suggest that 
these chickens play an important role generating novel reassortments in AIVs, 
and emphasize the need for continued surveillance of AIV strains circulating in 
poultry.
