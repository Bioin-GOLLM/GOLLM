AIMS: The apelin receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, has emerged as a key 
regulator of cardiovascular development, physiology, and disease. However, there 
is a lack of suitable human in vitro models to investigate the apelinergic 
system in cardiovascular cell types. For the first time we have used human 
embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and a novel inducible 
knockdown system to examine the role of the apelin receptor in both 
cardiomyocyte development and to determine the consequences of loss of apelin 
receptor function as a model of disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of the apelin receptor and its ligands in hESCs 
and hESC-CMs was determined. hESCs carrying a tetracycline-inducible short 
hairpin RNA targeting the apelin receptor were generated using the sOPTiKD 
system. Phenotypic assays characterized the consequences of either apelin 
receptor knockdown before hESC-CM differentiation (early knockdown) or in 3D 
engineered heart tissues as a disease model (late knockdown). hESC-CMs expressed 
the apelin signalling system at a similar level to the adult heart. Early apelin 
receptor knockdown decreased cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency and 
prolonged voltage sensing, associated with asynchronous contraction. Late apelin 
receptor knockdown had detrimental consequences on 3D engineered heart tissue 
contractile properties, decreasing contractility and increasing stiffness.
CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully knocked down the apelin receptor, using an 
inducible system, to demonstrate a key role in hESC-CM differentiation. 
Knockdown in 3D engineered heart tissues recapitulated the phenotype of apelin 
receptor down-regulation in a failing heart, providing a potential platform for 
modelling heart failure and testing novel therapeutic strategies.
