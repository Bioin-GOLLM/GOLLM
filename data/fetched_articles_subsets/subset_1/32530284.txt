Tremendous effort has been given to the development of diagnostic tests, 
preventive vaccines, and therapeutic medicines for coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2). Much of this development has been based on the reference genome 
collected on January 5, 2020. Based on the genotyping of 15â€¯140 genome samples 
collected up to June 1, 2020, we report that SARS-CoV-2 has undergone 8309 
single mutations which can be clustered into six subtypes. We introduce mutation 
ratio and mutation h-index to characterize the protein conservativeness and 
unveil that SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein, main protease, and endoribonuclease 
protein are relatively conservative, while SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, 
spike protein, and papain-like protease are relatively nonconservative. In 
particular, we have identified mutations on 40% of nucleotides in the 
nucleocapsid gene in the population level, signaling potential impacts on the 
ongoing development of COVID-19 diagnosis, vaccines, and antibody and 
small-molecular drugs.
