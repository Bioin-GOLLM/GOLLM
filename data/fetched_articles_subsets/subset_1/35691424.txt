Coronaviruses are a class of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that 
have caused three major outbreaks over the past two decades: Middle East 
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). All outbreaks have been associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality. In this study, we have identified and explored 
conserved binding sites in the key coronavirus proteins for the development of 
broad-spectrum direct acting anti-coronaviral compounds and validated the 
significance of this conservation for drug discovery with existing experimental 
data. We have identified four coronaviral proteins with highly conserved binding 
site sequence and 3D structure similarity: PLpro, Mpro, nsp10-nsp16 
complex(methyltransferase), and nsp15 endoribonuclease. We have compiled all 
available experimental data for known antiviral medications inhibiting these 
targets and identified compounds active against multiple coronaviruses. The 
identified compounds representing potential broad-spectrum antivirals include: 
GC376, which is active against six viral Mpro (out of six tested, as described 
in research literature); mycophenolic acid, which is active against four viral 
PLpro (out of four); and emetine, which is active against four viral RdRp (out 
of four). The approach described in this study for coronaviruses, which combines 
the assessment of sequence and structure conservation across a viral family with 
the analysis of accessible chemical structure - antiviral activity data, can be 
explored for the development of broad-spectrum drugs for multiple viral 
families.
