BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are each 
increasingly common in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Whether OSA 
increases cardiovascular consequences in ACS patients with MetS has not been 
investigated.
HYPOTHESIS: OSA increases cardiovascular risk in ACS patients with MetS. We 
aimed to examine the association between OSA and cardiovascular consequences in 
ACS patients with MetS.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we consecutive recruited 2160 ACS 
patients who underwent portable sleep breathing monitoring. OSA is defined as an 
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15 events/h. The primary endpoint was major adverse 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), including cardiovascular 
death, myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemia-driven revascularization, or 
hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure.
RESULTS: A total of 1927 patients with ACS were enrolled. Among them, 1486 
(77.1%) had MetS and 1014 (52.6%) had OSA. During 2.9 years of follow-up, the 
cumulative incidence of MACCE was similar between OSA and non-OSA groups in 
patients with MetS (21.9% vs. 17.9%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.29 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-1.67, p = .06) and patients without MetS (24.4% 
vs. 17.3%, adjusted HR = 1.21 95% CI: 0.73-2.03, p = .46). Patients with MetS 
and OSA had a significantly higher risk of MACCE than patients with MetS and 
without OSA in women (27.8% vs. 18.1%, adjusted HR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.01-3.09, 
p = .04) but not in men (21.0% vs. 17.9%, adjusted HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.91-1.59, 
p = .21).
CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized ACS patients with MetS, comorbid OSA was associated 
with increased risk of cardiovascular consequences among women.
