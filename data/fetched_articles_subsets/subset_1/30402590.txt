Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and often fatal cancer, affecting ~1 
person per million per year worldwide. Approximately 75% of patients with ACC 
eventually develop metastases and progress on the few available standard-of-care 
medical therapies, highlighting an incredible need for an improved understanding 
of the molecular biology of this disease. Although it has long been known that 
ACC is characterized by certain histological and genetic features (e.g., high 
mitotic activity, chromosomal instability, and overexpression of IGF2), only in 
the last two decades of genomics has the molecular landscape of ACC been more 
thoroughly characterized. In this review, we describe the findings of historical 
genetics and recent genomics studies on ACC and discuss how underlying concepts 
emerging from these studies contribute to the current model of critical pathways 
for adrenocortical carcinogenesis. Integrative synthesis across these studies 
reveals that ACC consists of three distinct molecular subtypes with divergent 
clinical outcomes and implicates differential regulation of Wnt signaling, cell 
cycle, DNA methylation, immune biology, and steroidogenesis in ACC biology. 
These cellular programs are pharmacologically targetable and may enable the 
development of therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for patients facing 
this devastating disease.
