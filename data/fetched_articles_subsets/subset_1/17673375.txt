BACKGROUND: CHFR is a mitotic checkpoint protein that under mitotic stress 
(caused also by taxanes) delays progression into mitosis.
METHODS: We looked for CHFR gene (605,209) alterations and its promoter 
hypermethylation in 48 ovarian carcinomas either sensitive or resistant to 
taxane treatment. We used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, 
sequencing and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Neither mutations in the CHFR gene nor hypermethylation of its promoter 
region were found. A novel single nucleotide polymorphism (Val154Val) was 
identified in exon 5 of alternatively spliced transcript.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CHFR gene status cannot serve as a 
molecular predictor of ovarian cancer sensitivity to taxanes.
