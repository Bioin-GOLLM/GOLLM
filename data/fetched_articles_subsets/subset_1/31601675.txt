Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is characterized by immune 
dysregulation due to inadequate restraint of overactivated immune cells and is 
associated with a variable clinical spectrum having overlap with more common 
pathophysiologies. HLH is difficult to diagnose and can be part of inflammatory 
syndromes. Here, we identify a novel hematological/autoinflammatory condition 
(NOCARH syndrome) in four unrelated patients with superimposable features, 
including neonatal-onset cytopenia with dyshematopoiesis, autoinflammation, 
rash, and HLH. Patients shared the same de novo CDC42 mutation 
(Chr1:22417990C>T, p.R186C) and altered hematopoietic compartment, immune 
dysregulation, and inflammation. CDC42 mutations had been associated with 
syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders. In vitro and in vivo assays documented 
unique effects of p.R186C on CDC42 localization and function, correlating with 
the distinctiveness of the trait. Emapalumab was critical to the survival of one 
patient, who underwent successful bone marrow transplantation. Early recognition 
of the disorder and establishment of treatment followed by bone marrow 
transplant are important to survival.
