We report a case of a 53-year-old woman with Grade 1 serous cystadenocarcinoma 
on her left ovary and metastatic serous adenocarcinoma on her right ovary. 
Serous carcinoma is the most common type of ovarian cancer, representing 
approximately half of all cases. Because of positive family history, the patient 
was referred for BRCA1/2 screening. Germline BRCA1 mutation c.676delT 
(p.C226VfsX8) was found, and in tumor tissue the normal allele was lost. Tumor 
tissue also had loss of heterozygosity in the PTCH1 gene, one of the major 
members of the Hedgehog-Gli (Hh-Gli) pathway. Gene expression analysis showed 
upregulation of the Hh-Gli pathway in both ovaries compared with healthy ovarian 
tissue. Primary cell culture was developed from the patient's tissue and showed 
downregulation of gene expression in response to cyclopamine, a Hh-Gli pathway 
inhibitor. The Hh-Gli signaling pathway may play a role in malignant 
transformation and metastasis of ovarian cancer.
