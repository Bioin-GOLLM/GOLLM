Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most common 
chronic liver diseases worldwide. A strong relationship exists between NAFLD and 
diabetes mellitus. There is growing evidence of a mechanistically complex and 
strong association between the two diseases. Current data also shows that one 
disease actually leads to worsening of the other and vice versa. Understanding 
of the various pathophysiological mechanisms involved, natural history and 
spectrum of these two diseases is essential not only for early diagnosis and 
management but also for prevention of severe disease forms. Despite the 
tremendous progress made in recent times in acquiring knowledge about these 
highly prevalent diseases, the guidelines and recommendations for screening and 
management of diabetics with NAFLD remain ambiguous. An interdisciplinary 
approach is required to not only raise awareness of the prevalence of NAFLD in 
diabetics but also for better patient management. This can help attenuate the 
development of significant complications, such as cirrhosis, decompensation and 
hepatocellular carcinoma in these patients, thereby halting NAFLD in its tracks. 
This review focuses on the pivotal role of primary care physicians and 
endocrinologists in identification of NAFLD in diabetics in early stages and the 
role of proactive screening for prompt referral to hepatologist.
