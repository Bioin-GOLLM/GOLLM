BACKGROUND: As the manual creation and maintenance of biomedical ontologies are 
labor-intensive, automatic aids are desirable in the lifecycle of ontology 
development.
OBJECTIVE: Provided with a set of concept names in the Foundational Model of 
Anatomy (FMA), we propose an innovative method for automatically generating the 
taxonomy and the partonomy structures among them, respectively.
METHODS: Our approach comprises 2 main tasks: The first task is predicting the 
direct relation between 2 given concept names by utilizing word embedding 
methods and training 2 machine learning models, Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM). The second 
task is the introduction of an original granularity-based method to identify the 
semantic structures among a group of given concept names by leveraging these 
trained models.
RESULTS: Results show that both CNN and Bi-LSTM perform well on the first task, 
with F1 measures above 0.91. For the second task, our approach achieves an 
average F1 measure of 0.79 on 100 case studies in the FMA using Bi-LSTM, which 
outperforms the primitive pairwise-based method.
CONCLUSIONS: We have investigated an automatic way of predicting a hierarchical 
relationship between 2 concept names; based on this, we have further invented a 
methodology to structure a group of concept names automatically. This study is 
an initial investigation that will shed light on further work on the automatic 
creation and enrichment of biomedical ontologies.
