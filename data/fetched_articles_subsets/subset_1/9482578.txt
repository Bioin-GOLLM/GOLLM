We characterized microsatellite marker haplotypes and identified mutations in 
members of 19 ethnically diverse Israeli families affected by Wilson disease 
(WD). Eighteen unique haplotypes were derived from allelic combinations for four 
marker loci spanning the WD gene, ATP7B, at chromosome 13q14.3: D13S133, 
D13S296, D13S301 and D13S295. Most of these haplotypes are population specific 
and vary among and even within different ethnic groups. Intrafamilial 
variability of WD haplotypes was observed in two large consanguineous families 
in which a single origin of WD was expected. In contrast, some WD haplotypes 
were identified in more than one group. Five novel and four previously described 
mutations were detected in our sample. The novel mutations include two deletions 
(845delT and 1639delC) and three missense mutations (E1064A, M645R, and G1213V). 
Mutations were identified for 11 of the 18 WD haplotypes, suggesting that other 
mutations may reside in noncoding regions of the ATP7B gene. Identification of 
all WD mutations will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the normal 
function of ATP7B as well as lead to more accurate prognosis and genetic 
counseling.
