BACKGROUND: Hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
may limit the use of aspirin in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Aspirin 
desensitization, which is a resource-intensive process, can offer such patients 
access to aspirin through the induction of temporary tolerance to aspirin. 
However, there is limited information on aspirin desensitization response in 
patients undergoing aspirin desensitization for cardiac indications in Asia.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize patients who have undergone aspirin desensitization, 
evaluate their responses to the procedure, and identify risk factor(s) 
associated with failure of aspirin desensitization.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of patients who 
underwent aspirin desensitization in Singapore General Hospital between 1 June 
2014 and 31 October 2017. Chi-square or Fisher exact test were used to analyze 
categorical data while independent samples t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were 
used for continuous data where appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression was 
used to identify predictors of aspirin desensitization failure.
RESULTS: All 214 patients in our study had cardiovascular indications for 
aspirin, with angioedema being the most common type of index reaction 
experienced with NSAIDs (n = 104, 48.6%). One hundred sixty-five patients 
(77.1%) achieved successful aspirin desensitization. In the selected sample 
analysis of patients with true NSAID hypersensitivity (n = 163), an index 
reaction of angioedema to NSAIDs was found to be significantly associated with a 
higher risk of failing aspirin desensitization (odds ratio, 7.21; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.94-26.71).
CONCLUSION: Majority of the patients who underwent aspirin desensitization in 
our institution were able to achieve tolerance to aspirin. An index reaction of 
angioedema to NSAIDs was identified as a risk factor for aspirin desensitization 
failure. This information can aid in the risk stratification of patients 
undergoing aspirin desensitization and ensure efficient resource allocation for 
this procedure.
