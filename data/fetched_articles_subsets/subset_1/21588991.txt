The asymmetric unit of the title compound, C(21)H(18)O(3), contains two 
crystallographically independent mol-ecules. The two mol-ecules are linked into 
cyclic centrosymmetric dimers R(2) (2)(8) by O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The dihedral 
angles between the naphthalene ring system and the benzene ring are 87.0 (8) and 
84.4 (2)° in the two mol-ecules. The crystal packing is stabilized by O-H⋯O, 
C-H⋯π and π-π inter-actions [centroid-centroid distance = 3.664 (11) Å]. In one 
mol-ecule, the mesityl ring is disordered over two positions [occupancy ratio 
0.690 (3):0.690 (3)].
