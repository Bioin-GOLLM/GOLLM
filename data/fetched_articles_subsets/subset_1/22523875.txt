OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the distribution of genotypic and allelic 
frequencies of ICAM-1 K469 of Korean women with preeclampsia are different from 
that of a control group.
STUDY DESIGN: In this case-control study the ICAM-1 K469E polymorphism was 
genotyped in 42 women with preeclampsia and 138 normotensive controls who had 
delivered at least two normal, term infants. A direct sequencing reaction method 
was used to detect a single nucleotide polymorphism.
RESULTS: The distribution of genotype frequencies and the frequency of the K469 
allele of the preeclampsia group were not significantly different from those of 
the controls. A similar trend was observed between the severe preeclampsia 
patients and the controls.
CONCLUSION: The frequencies of the KK genotype and the K allele were higher in 
the preeclampsia group than those in the control group. However, there was no 
statistically significant difference.
