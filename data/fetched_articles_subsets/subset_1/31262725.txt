Neurexins are well-characterized presynaptic cell adhesion molecules that engage 
multifarious postsynaptic ligands and organize diverse synapse properties. 
However, the precise synaptic localization of neurexins remains enigmatic. Using 
super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that neurexin-1 forms discrete 
nanoclusters at excitatory synapses, revealing a novel organizational feature of 
synaptic architecture. Synapses generally contain a single nanocluster that 
comprises more than four neurexin-1 molecules and that also includes neurexin-2 
and/or neurexin-3 isoforms. Moreover, we find that neurexin-1 is physiologically 
cleaved by ADAM10 similar to its ligand neuroligin-1, with ∼4-6% of neurexin-1 
and ∼2-3% of neuroligin-1 present in the adult brain as soluble ectodomain 
proteins. Blocking ADAM10-mediated neurexin-1 cleavage dramatically increased 
the synaptic neurexin-1 content, thereby elevating the percentage of Homer1(+) 
excitatory synapses containing neurexin-1 nanoclusters from 40-50% to ∼80%, and 
doubling the number of neurexin-1 molecules per nanocluster. Taken together, our 
results reveal an unexpected nanodomain organization of synapses in which 
neurexin-1 is assembled into discrete presynaptic nanoclusters that are 
dynamically regulated via ectodomain cleavage.
