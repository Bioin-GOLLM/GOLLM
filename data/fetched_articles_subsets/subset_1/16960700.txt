RATIONALE: The endogenous opioid system has been implicated in substance abuse 
and response to pharmacotherapies for nicotine and alcohol addiction. We 
examined (1) the association of the functional OPRM1 A118G variant with the 
relative reinforcing value of nicotine and (2) the main and interacting effects 
of the mu-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone on nicotine reinforcement.
METHODS: In a within-subject, double-blind human laboratory study, 30 smokers of 
each OPRM1 genotype (A/A vs. A/G or G/G) participated in two experimental 
sessions following 4 days of orally administered naltrexone 50 mg or placebo. 
Participants completed a validated assessment of the relative reinforcing value 
of nicotine. This cigarette choice paradigm assesses self-administration of 0.6 
mg nicotine vs. 0.05 mg (denicotinized) cigarettes after a brief period of 
nicotine abstinence.
RESULTS: The relative reinforcing value of nicotine (number of nicotine 
cigarette puffs) was predicted by a significant OPRM1 by gender interaction. 
Among women, the low-activity G allele (A/G and G/G) was associated with a 
reduced reinforcing value of nicotine; among male smokers, there was no 
association with genotype. Smokers carrying a G allele were also significantly 
less likely to differentiate the nicotine vs. denicotinized cigarettes by 
subjective ratings of satisfaction and strength. No evidence for an effect of 
naltrexone on nicotine reinforcement was found in the overall sample or in the 
genotype or gender subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence for an association of the 
OPRM1 A118G variant with nicotine reinforcement in women.
