Some HIV-infected individuals develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), 
whereas most develop antibodies that neutralize only a narrow range of viruses 
(nNAbs). bNAbs, but not nNAbs, protect animals from experimental infection and 
are likely a key component of an effective vaccine. nNAbs and bNAbs target the 
same regions of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env), but for reasons that 
remain unclear only nNAbs are elicited by Env immunization. We show that in 
contrast to germline-reverted (gl) bNAbs, glnNAbs recognized diverse recombinant 
Envs. Moreover, owing to binding affinity differences, nNAb B cell progenitors 
had an advantage in becoming activated and internalizing Env compared with bNAb 
B cell progenitors. We then identified an Env modification strategy that 
minimized the activation of nNAb B cells targeting epitopes that overlap those 
of bNAbs.
