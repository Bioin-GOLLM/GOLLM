Japanese cedar (JC) pollinosis is the most major IgE-mediated type I allergic 
disease in Japan. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is the only curative treatment 
for allergic diseases. Subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy 
have been introduced in Japan for JC pollinosis, but do not avoid some adverse 
side effects, because the natural allergens used as tolerogens cross-link with 
specific IgE types on mast cells and basophils. To make immunotherapy for JC 
pollinosis safer, more effective and convenient, rice-based oral allergy 
vaccines using hybrid peptides composed of multiple T-cell epitopes or 
recombinant deconstructed hypoallergenic derivatives derived from major 
allergens - Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 - have been developed and their efficacy and 
safety evaluated by oral administration of transgenic rice seeds. Furthermore, 
recombinant modified JC allergens conjugated with various immunomodulatory 
molecules and DNA-based vaccines have been created and their efficacy assessed.
