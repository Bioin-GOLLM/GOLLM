Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is classically viewed as an important endogenous 
antioxidant and key component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. For this 
second function, CoQ molecules seem to be dynamically segmented in a pool 
attached and engulfed by the super-complexes I + III, and a free pool available 
for complex II or any other mitochondrial enzyme that uses CoQ as a cofactor. 
This CoQ-free pool is, therefore, used by enzymes that link the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain to other pathways, such as the pyrimidine de novo 
biosynthesis, fatty acid β-oxidation and amino acid catabolism, glycine 
metabolism, proline, glyoxylate and arginine metabolism, and sulfide oxidation 
metabolism. Some of these mitochondrial pathways are also connected to metabolic 
pathways in other compartments of the cell and, consequently, CoQ could 
indirectly modulate metabolic pathways located outside the mitochondria. Thus, 
we review the most relevant findings in all these metabolic functions of CoQ and 
their relations with the pathomechanisms of some metabolic diseases, 
highlighting some future perspectives and potential therapeutic implications.
