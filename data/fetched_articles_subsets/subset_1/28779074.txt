Although experience-dependent changes in brain inhibitory circuits are thought 
to play a key role during the "critical period" of brain development, the nature 
and timing of these changes are poorly understood. We examined the role of 
sensory experience in sculpting an inhibitory circuit in the primary 
somatosensory cortex (S1) of mice by using optogenetics to map the connections 
between parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneurons and layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. 
Unilateral whisker deprivation decreased the strength and spatial range of 
inhibitory input provided to pyramidal neurons by PV interneurons in layers 2/3, 
4 and 5. By varying the time when sensory input was removed, we determined that 
the critical period closes around postnatal day 14. This yields the first 
precise time course of critical period plasticity for an inhibitory circuit.
