Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely related to insulin 
resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. It is considered a multisystem 
disease and there is a strong association with cardiovascular disease and 
arterial hypertension, which interfere with changes in the coagulation system. 
Coagulation disorders are common in patients with hepatic impairment and are 
dependent on the degree of liver damage. Through a review of the literature, we 
consider and discuss possible disorders in the coagulation cascade and 
fibrinolysis, endothelial dysfunction and platelet abnormalities in patients 
with NAFLD.
