GOSR2-associated PME is associated with a homozygous mutation in GOSR2 
(c.430G>T, p.Gly144Trp), a Golgi vesicle transport gene. The functional effect 
of this mutation is a loss of function that results in failure of the GOSR2 
protein to localize to the cis-Golgi. The main clinical features of the 
GOSR2-associated PME are early-onset ataxia, areflexia, action myoclonus and 
seizures, scoliosis, elevated creatine kinase levels, relative preservation of 
cognitive function until the late stages of the disease, and relentless disease 
course. Severe photosensitive myoclonus is a common feature. GOSR2-associated 
PME is a rare disease with very few cases reported so far and it can be expected 
that the identification of further patients will contribute to expanding the 
phenotype and genotype of this condition.
