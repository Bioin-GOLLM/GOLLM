A perimetastatic capsule is a strong positive prognostic factor in liver 
metastases, but its origin remains unclear. Here, we systematically quantify the 
capsule's extent and cellular composition in 263 patients with colorectal cancer 
liver metastases to investigate its clinical significance and origin. We show 
that survival improves proportionally with increasing encapsulation and 
decreasing tumor-hepatocyte contact. Immunostaining reveals the gradual zonation 
of the capsule, transitioning from benign-like NGFRhigh stroma at the liver edge 
to FAPhigh stroma towards the tumor. Encapsulation correlates with decreased 
tumor viability and preoperative chemotherapy. In mice, chemotherapy and tumor 
cell ablation induce capsule formation. Our results suggest that encapsulation 
develops where tumor invasion into the liver plates stalls, representing a 
reparative process rather than tumor-induced desmoplasia. We propose a model of 
metastases growth, where the efficient tumor colonization of the liver 
parenchyma and a reparative liver injury reaction are opposing determinants of 
metastasis aggressiveness.
