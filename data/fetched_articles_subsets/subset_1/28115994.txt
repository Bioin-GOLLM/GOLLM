prandial?

Several GLP-1 receptor agonists are currently available for treatment of type 2 
diabetic patients. Based on their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, these 
drugs are classified as short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide and 
lixisenatide) or long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide-LAR, 
liraglutide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide). In clinical practice, they are also 
classified as basal or prandial GLP-1 receptor agonists to differentiate between 
patients who would benefit more from one or another based on characteristics 
such as previous treatment and the predominance of fasting or postprandial 
hyperglycemia. In the present article we examine available data on the 
pharmacokinetic characteristics of the various GLP-1 agonists and compare their 
effects with respect to the main parameters used to evaluate glycemic control. 
The article also analyzes whether the differences between the different GLP-1 
agonists justify their classification as basal or prandial.
