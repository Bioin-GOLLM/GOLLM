Disturbed blood flow induces inflammatory gene expression in endothelial cells, 
which promotes atherosclerosis. Flow stimulates the proinflammatory 
transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB through integrin- and 
Rac-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Previous work 
demonstrated that NF-kappaB activation by flow is matrix-specific, occurring in 
cells on fibronectin but not collagen. Activation of p21-activated kinase (PAK) 
followed the same matrix-dependent pattern. We now show that inhibiting PAK in 
cells on fibronectin blocked NF-kappaB activation by both laminar and 
oscillatory flow in vitro and at sites of disturbed flow in vivo. Constitutively 
active PAK rescued flow-induced NF-kappaB activation in cells on collagen. 
Surprisingly, PAK was not required for flow-induced ROS production. Instead, PAK 
modulated the ability of ROS to activate the NF-kappaB pathway. These data 
demonstrate that PAK controls NF-kappaB activation by modulating the sensitivity 
of cells to ROS.
