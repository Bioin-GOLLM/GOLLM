Mutation of the iron ligand His 249 to Glu in the N-lobe of human transferrin 
abolishes the dilysine "trigger" but does not significantly affect iron release.

Serum transferrin is the major iron transport protein in humans. Its function 
depends on its ability to bind iron with very high affinity, yet to release this 
bound iron at the lower intracellular pH. Possible explanations for the release 
of iron from transferrin at low pH include protonation of a histidine ligand and 
the existence of a pH-sensitive "trigger" involving a hydrogen-bonded pair of 
lysines in the N-lobe of transferrin. We have determined the crystal structure 
of the His249Glu mutant of the N-lobe half-molecule of human transferrin and 
compared its iron-binding properties with those of the wild-type protein and 
other mutants. The crystal structure, determined at 2.4 A resolution (R-factor 
19.8%, R(free) 29.4%), shows that Glu 249 is directly bound to iron, in place of 
the His ligand, and that a local movement of Lys 296 has broken the dilysine 
interaction. Despite the loss of this potentially pH-sensitive interaction, the 
H249E mutant is only slightly more acid-stable than wild-type and releases iron 
slightly faster. We conclude that the loss of the dilysine interaction does make 
the protein more acid stable but that this is counterbalanced by the replacement 
of a neutral ligand (His) by a negatively charged one (Glu), thus disrupting the 
electroneutrality of the binding site.
