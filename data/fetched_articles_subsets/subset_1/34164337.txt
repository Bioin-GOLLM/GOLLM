BACKGROUND: Familial cancers comprise a considerable distribution of colorectal 
cancers (CRCs), of which only about 5% occurs through well-established 
hereditary syndromes. It has been demonstrated that deleterious variants at the 
newly identified cancer-predisposing genes could describe the etiology of 
undefined familial cancers.
METHODS: The present study aimed to identify the genetic etiology in a 
32-year-old man with early onset familial CRC employing several molecular 
diagnostic techniques. DNA was extracted from tumoral and normal 
formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, and microsatellite instability 
(MSI) was evaluated. Immunohistochemistry staining of MMR proteins was performed 
on tumoral FFPE blocks. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), multiplex 
ligation-dependent amplification (MLPA) assay, and Sanger sequencing were 
applied on the genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Data analysis was 
performed using bioinformatics tools. Genetic variants interpretation was based 
on ACMG.
RESULTS: MSI analysis indicated MSI-H phenotype, and IHC staining proved no 
expressions of MSH2 and MSH6 proteins. MLPA and NGS data showed no pathogenic 
variants in MMR genes. Further analysis of NGS data revealed a candidate WRN 
frameshift variant (p.R389Efs*3), which was validated with Sanger sequencing. 
The variant was interpreted as pathogenic since it met the criteria based on the 
ACMG guideline including very strong (PVS1), strong (PS3), and moderate (PM2).
CONCLUSION: WRN is a DNA helicase participating in DNA repair pathways to 
sustain genomic stability. WRN deficient function may contribute to CRC 
development that is valuable for further investigation as a candidate gene in 
hereditary cancer syndrome diagnosis.
