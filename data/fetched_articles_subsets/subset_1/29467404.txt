Uneven distribution and local concentration of protein complexes on distinct 
membrane cortices is a fundamental property in numerous biological processes, 
including Drosophila neuroblast (NB) asymmetric cell divisions and cell polarity 
in general. In NBs, the cell fate determinant Numb forms a basal crescent 
together with Pon and is segregated into the basal daughter cell to initiate its 
differentiation. Here we discover that Numb PTB domain, using two distinct 
binding surfaces, recognizes repeating motifs within Pon in a previously 
unrecognized mode. The multivalent Numb-Pon interaction leads to high binding 
specificity and liquid-liquid phase separation of the complex. Perturbations of 
the Numb/Pon complex phase transition impair the basal localization of Numb and 
its subsequent suppression of Notch signaling during NB asymmetric divisions. 
Such phase-transition-mediated protein condensations on distinct membrane 
cortices may be a general mechanism for various cell polarity regulatory 
complexes.
