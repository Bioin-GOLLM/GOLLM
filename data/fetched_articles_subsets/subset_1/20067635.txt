BACKGROUND: Bone metastases are a common and dismal consequence of lung cancer 
that is a leading cause of death. The role of IL-7 in promoting bone metastases 
has been previously investigated in NSCLC, but many aspects remain to be 
disclosed. To further study IL-7 function in bone metastasis, we developed a 
human-in-mice model of bone aggression by NSCLC and analyzed human bone 
metastasis biopsies.
METHODS: We used NOD/SCID mice implanted with human bone. After bone 
engraftment, two groups of mice were injected subcutaneously with A549, a human 
NSCLC cell line, either close or at the contralateral flank to the human bone 
implant, while a third control group did not receive cancer cells. Tumor and 
bone vitality and IL-7 expression were assessed in implanted bone, affected or 
not by A549. Serum IL-7 levels were evaluated by ELISA. IL-7 
immunohistochemistry was performed on 10 human bone NSCLC metastasis biopsies 
for comparison.
RESULTS: At 12 weeks after bone implant, we observed osteogenic activity and 
neovascularization, confirming bone vitality. Tumor aggressive cells implanted 
close to human bone invaded the bone tissue. The bone-aggressive cancer cells 
were positive for IL-7 staining both in the mice model and in human biopsies. 
Higher IL-7 serum levels were found in mice injected with A549 cells close to 
the bone implant compared to mice injected with A549 cells in the flank opposite 
to the bone implant.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that bone-invading cells express and produce IL-7, 
which is known to promote osteoclast activation and osteolytic lesions. 
Tumor-bone interaction increases IL-7 production, with an increase in IL-7 serum 
levels. The presented mice model of bone invasion by contiguous tumor is 
suitable to study bone-tumor cell interaction. IL-7 plays a role in the first 
steps of metastatic process.
