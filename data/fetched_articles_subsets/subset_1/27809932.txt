A given cell makes exchanges with its neighbors through a variety of means 
ranging from diffusible factors to vesicles. Cells use also tunneling nanotubes 
(TNTs), filamentous-actin-containing membranous structures that bridge and 
connect cells. First described in immune cells, TNTs facilitate HIV-1 transfer 
and are found in various cell types, including neurons. We show that the 
microtubule-associated protein Tau, a key player in Alzheimer's disease, is a 
bona fide constituent of TNTs. This is important because Tau appears beside 
filamentous actin and myosin 10 as a specific marker of these fine protrusions 
of membranes and cytosol that are difficult to visualize. Furthermore, we 
observed that exogenous Tau species increase the number of TNTs established 
between primary neurons, thereby facilitating the intercellular transfer of Tau 
fibrils. In conclusion, Tau may contribute to the formation and function of the 
highly dynamic TNTs that may be involved in the prion-like propagation of Tau 
assemblies.
