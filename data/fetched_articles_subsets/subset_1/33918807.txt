Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 2 (P3H2) catalyzes the post-translational formation of 
3-hydroxyproline on collagens, mainly on type IV. Its activity has never been 
directly associated to angiogenesis. Here, we identified P3H2 gene through a 
deep-sequencing transcriptome analysis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVECs) stimulated with vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). 
Differently from many previous studies we carried out the stimulation not on 
starved HUVECs, but on cells grown to maintain the best condition for their in 
vitro survival and propagation. We showed that P3H2 is induced by VEGF-A in two 
primary human endothelial cell lines and that its transcription is modulated by 
VEGF-A/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) signaling pathway through p38 mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK). Then, we demonstrated that P3H2, through its activity on 
type IV Collagen, is essential for angiogenesis properties of endothelial cells 
in vitro by performing experiments of gain- and loss-of-function. 
Immunofluorescence studies showed that the overexpression of P3H2 induced a more 
condensed status of Collagen IV, accompanied by an alignment of the cells along 
the Collagen IV bundles, so towards an evident pro-angiogenic status. Finally, 
we found that P3H2 knockdown prevents pathological angiogenesis in vivo, in the 
model of laser-induced choroid neovascularization. Together these findings 
reveal that P3H2 is a new molecular player involved in new vessels formation and 
could be considered as a potential target for anti-angiogenesis therapy.
