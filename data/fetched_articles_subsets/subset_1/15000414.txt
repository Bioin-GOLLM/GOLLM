OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to identify environmental and 
personal factors that could be related to the variability in the age of onset of 
familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) (36-62 years).
METHODS: A sample was taken of 49 subjects with FAD and with the mutation E280A 
in the presenilin-1 gene on chromosome 14; the sample was divided into two 
subgroups: 27 individuals with age of onset of the disease between 36 and 46 
years (early onset) and 22 individuals whose disease began between 47 and 62 
years (late onset). Information on environmental and personal factors was 
collected by means of a questionnaire answered by the patients if their clinical 
condition allowed it, or by their relatives; such information was organized in a 
categorical way. Comparisons between the two groups for each categorical 
variable were done by means of the chi-square test. Noncollinear variables that 
showed statistical significance were included as independent variables in a 
logistic regression analysis to predict their association with early onset of 
the disease.
RESULTS: Only 5 of the 140 studied variables were different between the two 
groups in univariate analysis: education, surgical history, type of stressful 
event, depression, and affective losses. The logistic regression model was 
constituted by education, depression, and affective losses. High-level education 
had approximately 15 times more probability of association with an early onset 
of the disease; both the history of affective losses and depressive symptoms had 
4 times more probability of a similar association.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of high-level education and early onset of the 
disease could be related to an earlier detection of symptoms, in turn determined 
by greater intellectual and environmental demands. The occurrence of depression 
and affective losses has been considered a prodromic manifestation of the 
disease. Our findings are evidence of high clinical heterogeneity even in a 
genetically homogeneous group.
