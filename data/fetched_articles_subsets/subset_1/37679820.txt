BACKGROUND: The capacity of skeletal muscles to regenerate relies on Pax7+ 
muscle stem cells (MuSC). While in vitro-amplified MuSC are activated and lose 
part of their regenerative capacity, in vitro-generated human muscle reserve 
cells (MuRC) are very similar to quiescent MuSC with properties required for 
their use in cell-based therapies.
METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the heterogeneity of human MuRC 
and characterized their molecular signature and metabolic profile.
RESULTS: We observed that Notch signaling is active and essential for the 
generation of quiescent human Pax7+ MuRC in vitro. We also revealed, by 
immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, two distinct subpopulations of MuRC 
distinguished by their relative Pax7 expression. After 48 h in differentiation 
medium (DM), the Pax7High subpopulation represented 35% of the total MuRC pool 
and this percentage increased to 61% after 96 h in DM. Transcriptomic analysis 
revealed that Pax7High MuRC were less primed for myogenic differentiation as 
compared to Pax7Low MuRC and displayed a metabolic shift from glycolysis toward 
fatty acid oxidation. The bioenergetic profile of human MuRC displayed a 
1.5-fold decrease in glycolysis, basal respiration and ATP-linked respiration as 
compared to myoblasts. We also observed that AMPKα1 expression was significantly 
upregulated in human MuRC that correlated with an increased phosphorylation of 
acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Finally, we showed that fatty acid uptake was 
increased in MuRC as compared to myoblasts, whereas no changes were observed for 
glucose uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data reveal that the quiescent MuRC pool is 
heterogeneous for Pax7 with a Pax7High subpopulation being in a deeper quiescent 
state, less committed to differentiation and displaying a reduced metabolic 
activity. Altogether, our data suggest that human Pax7High MuRC may constitute 
an appropriate stem cell source for potential therapeutic applications in 
skeletal muscle diseases.
