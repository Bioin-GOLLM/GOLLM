BACKGROUND: A common phenotype associated with heart failure is the development 
of cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy occurs in response to stress, such 
as hypertension, coronary vascular disease, or myocardial infarction. The most 
critical pathophysiological conditions involved may include dilated hypertrophy, 
fibrosis and contractile malfunction. The intricate pathophysiological 
mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy have been the core of several scientific 
studies, which may help in opening a new avenue in preventive and curative 
procedures.
OBJECTIVES: To our knowledge from the literature, the development of cardiac 
remodeling and hypertrophy is multifactorial. Thus, in this review, we will 
focus and summarize the potential role of oxidative stress in cardiac 
hypertrophy development.
CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress is considered a major stimulant for the signal 
transduction in cardiac cells pathological conditions, including inflammatory 
cytokines, and MAP kinase. The understanding of the pathophysiological 
mechanisms which are involved in cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling process is 
crucial for the development of new therapeutic plans, especially that the 
mortality rates related to cardiac remodeling/dysfunction remain high.
