The primary objective of our study was to provide a simple and reliable assay 
for identifying the majority of G6PD genetic variants in the Chinese population. 
We optimized the multiplex primer extension reaction (MPER) assay for 
simultaneous screening of 14-point mutations in 98 G6PD-deficient subjects. Our 
data demonstrated that this method is precise, cost-effective and has 
successfully identified mutations in 97 out of 98 subjects, including all 
heterozygous mutants. We also detected a relatively high incidence (12.3%) of 
c.871G > A, and all of them harbored the silent mutation c.1311C > T. Apart from 
the screening program, the pharmacogenetic relationship between G6PD level and 
residual reduced glutathione (GSH) level was studied upon oxidative challenge by 
alpha-naphthol. The GSH levels were correlated with their status of G6PD 
deficiency, but no significant difference was observed between individual 
G6PD-deficient groups. Our data demonstrated the potentials of the MPER assay 
for characterization of G6PD deficiency and other genetic diseases.
