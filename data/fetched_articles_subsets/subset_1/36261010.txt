Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by extensive microvascular 
hyperproliferation. In addition to supplying blood to the tumor, GBM vessels 
also provide trophic support to glioma cells and serve as conduits for migration 
into the surrounding brain, promoting recurrence. Here, we enrich 
CD31-expressing glioma vascular cells (GVCs) and A2B5-expressing glioma tumor 
cells (GTCs) from primary GBM and use RNA sequencing to create a comprehensive 
molecular interaction map of the secreted and extracellular factors elaborated 
by GVCs that can interact with receptors and membrane molecules on GTCs. To 
validate our findings, we utilize functional assays, including a hydrogel-based 
migration assay and in vivo mouse models to demonstrate that one identified 
factor, the little-studied integrin binding sialoprotein (IBSP), enhances tumor 
growth and promotes the migration of GTCs along the vasculature. This 
perivascular niche interactome will serve as a resource to the research 
community in defining the potential functions of the GBM vasculature.
