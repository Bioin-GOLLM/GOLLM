PURPOSE: Cross-talk between type I IGF receptor (IGF1R), insulin receptor 
(INSR), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediates resistance to 
individual receptor blockade. This study aimed to determine the MTD, safety, 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of 
linsitinib, a potent oral IGF1R/INSR inhibitor, with EGFR inhibitor erlotinib.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This open-label, dose-escalation study investigated 
linsitinib schedules S1: once daily intermittent (days 1-3 weekly); S2, once 
daily continuous; S3, twice-daily continuous; each with erlotinib 100-150 mg 
once daily; and a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expansion cohort.
RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were enrolled (S1, 44; S2, 24; S3, 12; expansion 
cohort, 15) and 91 treated. Seven experienced dose-limiting toxicities: QTc 
prolongation (3), abnormal liver function (2), hyperglycemia (1), and anorexia 
(1). Common adverse events included drug eruption (84%), diarrhea (73%), fatigue 
(68%), nausea (58%), vomiting (40%). MTDs for linsitinib/erlotinib were 450/150 
mg (S1), 400/100 mg (S2). On the basis of prior monotherapy data, S3 dosing at 
150 mg twice daily/150 mg once daily was the recommended phase II dose for the 
expansion cohort. There was no evidence of drug-drug interaction. 
Pharmacodynamic data showed IGF-1 elevation and reduced IGF1R/INSR 
phosphorylation, suggesting pathway inhibition. Across schedules, 5/75 (7%) 
evaluable patients experienced partial responses: spinal chordoma (268+ weeks), 
rectal cancer (36 weeks), three NSCLCs including 2 adenocarcinomas (16, 72 
weeks), 1 squamous wild-type EGFR NSCLC (36 weeks). Disease control (CR+PR+SD) 
occurred in 38 of 75 (51%), and 28 of 91 (31%) patients were on study >12 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: The linsitinib/erlotinib combination was tolerable with preliminary 
evidence of activity, including durable responses in cases unlikely to respond 
to erlotinib monotherapy. Clin Cancer Res; 22(12); 2897-907. ©2016 AACR.
