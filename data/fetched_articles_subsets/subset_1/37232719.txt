Based on the knowledge that many diseases are caused by defects in the 
metabolism of the cells and, in particular, in defects of the mitochondria, 
mitochondrial medicine starts precisely at this point. This new form of therapy 
is used in numerous fields of human medicine and has become a central focus 
within the field of medicine in recent years. With this form of therapy, the 
disturbed cellular energy metabolism and an out-of-balance antioxidant system of 
the patient are to be influenced to a greater extent. The most important tool 
here is mitotropic substances, with the help of which attempts are made to 
compensate for existing dysfunction. In this article, both mitotropic substances 
and accompanying studies showing their efficacy are summarized. It appears that 
the action of many mitotropic substances is based on two important properties. 
First, on the property of acting antioxidantly, both directly as antioxidants 
and via activation of downstream enzymes and signaling pathways of the 
antioxidant system, and second, via enhanced transport of electrons and protons 
in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
