Synucleinopathies are neurodegenerative disorders involving pathological 
alpha-synuclein (αSyn) protein, including dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple 
system atrophy and Parkinson's disease (PD). Current in vivo models of 
synucleinopathy include transgenic mice overexpressing αSyn variants and methods 
based on administration of aggregated, exogenous αSyn. Combining these 
techniques offers the ability to study consequences of introducing pathological 
αSyn into primed neuronal environments likely to develop synucleinopathy. 
Herein, we characterize the impacts pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) of recombinant, 
human αSyn have in mice overexpressing human A30P αSyn, a mutation associated 
with autosomal dominant PD. A30P mouse brain contains detergent insoluble αSyn 
biochemically similar to PD brain, and these mice develop Lewy-like 
synucleinopathy with age. Administration of PFFs in A30P mice resulted in 
regionally-specific accumulations of phosphorylated synuclein, microglial 
induction and a motor phenotype that differed from PFF-induced effects in 
wildtype mice. Surprisingly, PFF-induced losses of tyrosine hydroxylase were 
similar in A30P and wildtype mice. Thus, the PFF-A30P model recapitulates key 
aspects of synucleinopathy with induction of microglia, creating an appropriate 
system for evaluating neurodegenerative therapeutics.
