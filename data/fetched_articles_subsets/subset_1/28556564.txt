Both serology-based and genetic studies have reported an association between 
pancreatic cancer risk and ABO blood groups. We have investigated this 
relationship in a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients from Western Norway 
(n = 237) and two control materials (healthy blood donors, n = 379; unselected 
hospitalized patients, n = 6149). When comparing patient and blood donor ABO 
allele frequencies, we found only the A1 allele to be associated with 
significantly higher risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (23.8% vs. 
17.9%; OR = 1.43, P = 0.018). Analyzing phenotypes, blood group A was more 
frequent among PDAC cases than blood donors (50.8% vs. 40.6%; OR = 1.51, 
P = 0.021), an enrichment fully explained by the A1 subgroup. Blood group O 
frequency was lower in cases than in blood donors (33.8% vs. 42.7%; OR = 0.69, 
P = 0.039). This lower frequency was confirmed when cases were compared to 
hospitalized patients (33.8% vs. 42.9%; OR = 0.68, P = 0.012). Results for blood 
group B varied according to which control cohort was used for comparison. When 
patients were classified according to surgical treatment, the enrichment of 
blood group A was most prominent among unresected cases (54.0%), who also had 
the lowest prevalence of O (28.7%). There was a statistically significant better 
survival (P = 0.04) for blood group O cases than non-O cases among unresected 
but not among resected patients. Secretor status did not show an association 
with PDAC or survival. Our study demonstrates that pancreatic cancer risk is 
influenced by ABO status, in particular blood groups O and A1 , and that this 
association may reflect also in tumor resectability and survival.
