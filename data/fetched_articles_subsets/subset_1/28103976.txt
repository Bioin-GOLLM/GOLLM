Targeted therapy was one of the major treatments in advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) with positive driver genes. This area of research progresses day 
by day, with novel target discoveries, novel drug development, and use of novel 
combination treatments. Researchers have also undergone deep investigation about 
the molecular mechanisms underlying inherent or acquired resistance to these 
targeted therapies. This review aimed to summarize the advanced developments of 
targeted therapy for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and other rare driver 
genes in NSCLC.

靶向治疗是驱动基因阳性的晚期非小细胞肺癌重要的治疗手段之一，这个领域的治疗进展日新月异，包括新靶点的发现，新药物的问世以及靶向联合治疗方案的应用等，同时研究人员也深入地研究了各种靶向药物原发或获得性耐药机制。本综述旨在总结间变淋巴瘤激酶融合基因（anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase, ALK）及其他少见驱动基因阳性的非小细胞肺癌靶向治疗的新进展。.
