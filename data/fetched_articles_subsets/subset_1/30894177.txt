BACKGROUND: Subtle impairments in left ventricular (LV) function and geometry 
are common findings in individuals with diabetes. However, whether these 
impairments precede the development of diabetes mellitus (DM) is not entirely 
clear.
METHODS: Echocardiograms from 1710 individuals from the general population free 
of prevalent diabetes mellitus were analyzed. Left ventricular (LV) concentric 
geometry was defined as either LV concentric remodeling or LV concentric 
hypertrophy as directed in contemporary guidelines. The severity of LV 
concentricity was assessed by relative wall thickness (RWT) calculated as 
posterior wall thickness (PWT) indexed to left ventricular internal diameter at 
end diastole (LVIDd) (RWT = 2 * PWT/LVIDd). End-point was incident DM.
RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 12.6 years (IQR: 12.0-12.8 years). Follow-up 
was a 100%. A total of 55 participants (3.3%) developed DM during follow-up. At 
baseline, the prevalence of a concentric LV geometric pattern was significantly 
higher (41.8% vs 20.3%, p < 0.001) in individuals who developed DM during 
follow-up. In a final multivariable model adjusting for established DM risk 
factors including HbA1c, BMI and plasma glucose, LV concentric geometry and RWT 
remained significantly associated with incident DM (LV concentric geometry: HR 
1.99, 95% CI 1.11-3.57, p = 0.021) (RWT: HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06-1.86, p = 0.017, 
per 0.1 increase). This association remained despite adjustment for established 
risk factors for DM.
CONCLUSION: Altered LV geometry may precede the development of DM. LV concentric 
geometry determined by echocardiography and the severity of LV concentricity 
evaluated as RWT are associated with incident DM in the general population.
