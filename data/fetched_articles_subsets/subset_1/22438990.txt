Tankyrases (TNKS1 and TNKS2) are key regulators of cellular processes such as 
telomere pathway and Wnt signaling. IWRs (inhibitors of Wnt response) have 
recently been identified as potent and selective inhibitors of tankyrases. 
However, it is not clear how these IWRs interact with tankyrases. Here we report 
the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human TNKS1 in complex with 
IWR2, which reveals a novel binding site for tankyrase inhibitors. The 
TNKS1/IWR2 complex provides a molecular basis for their strong and specific 
interactions and suggests clues for further development of tankyrase inhibitors.
