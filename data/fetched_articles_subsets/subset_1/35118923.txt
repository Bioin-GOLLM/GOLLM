TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) gene mutations cause ALS and frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD). We report a novel TBK1 mutation in a Brazilian patient with ALS. 
Symptoms started at age 44 (lower-limb onset). Despite treatment with riluzole, 
his condition progressed over 5 years to aphemia, dysphagia, gastrostomy and 
tracheostomy. A diagnostic test panel for neurodegenerative disorders disclosed 
a novel likely pathogenic heterozygous intronic mutation in the TBK1 gene: 
c.1189 + 1G &gt; T (Splice donor), intron 9. This mutation is expected to 
disrupt RNA splicing and lead to loss of protein function. Disruption of this 
splice site has been observed in patients with TBK1-related disorders. Separate 
and additional C9ORFF72 testing was negative. To our knowledge, this is the 
second patient with a TBK1 mutation (novel splice donor intronic mutation) 
reported in Brazil, and the first to include a full description of the clinical 
course. Further studies are necessary to establish the frequency of TBK1 
mutations in Brazilian ALS patients (and worldwide) and to evaluate the possible 
different clinical phenotypes and the disease course.
