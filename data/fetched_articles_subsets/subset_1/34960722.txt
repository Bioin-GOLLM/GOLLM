Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), 
are a group of neurodegenerative protein misfolding diseases that invariably 
cause death. TSEs occur when the endogenous cellular prion protein (PrPC) 
misfolds to form the pathological prion protein (PrPSc), which templates further 
conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, accumulates, and initiates a cascade of pathologic 
processes in cells and tissues. Different strains of prion disease within a 
species are thought to arise from the differential misfolding of the prion 
protein and have different clinical phenotypes. Different strains of prion 
disease may also result in differential accumulation of PrPSc in brain regions 
and tissues of natural hosts. Here, we review differential accumulation that 
occurs in the retinal ganglion cells, cerebellar cortex and white matter, and 
plexuses of the enteric nervous system in cattle with bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy, sheep and goats with scrapie, cervids with chronic wasting 
disease, and humans with prion diseases. By characterizing TSEs in their natural 
host, we can better understand the pathogenesis of different prion strains. This 
information is valuable in the pursuit of evaluating and discovering potential 
biomarkers and therapeutics for prion diseases.
