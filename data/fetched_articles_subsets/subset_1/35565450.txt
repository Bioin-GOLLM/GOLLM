Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal malignant 
neoplasms, ranking in seventh place in the world in terms of the incidence of 
death, with overall 5-year survival rates still below 10%. The knowledge about 
PC pathomechanisms is rapidly expanding. Daily reports reveal new aspects of 
tumor biology, including its molecular and morphological heterogeneity, explain 
complicated "cross-talk" that happens between the cancer cells and tumor stroma, 
or the nature of the PC-associated neural remodeling (PANR). Staying up-to-date 
is hard and crucial at the same time. In this review, we are focusing on a 
comprehensive summary of PC aspects that are important in pathologic reporting, 
impact patients' outcomes, and bring meaningful information for clinicians. 
Finally, we show promising new trends in diagnostic technologies that might 
bring a difference in PC early diagnosis.
