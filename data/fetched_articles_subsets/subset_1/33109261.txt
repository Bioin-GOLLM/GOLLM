BACKGROUND: Humans and viruses have co-evolved for millennia resulting in a 
complex host genetic architecture. Understanding the genetic mechanisms of 
immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and 
therapeutic opportunities.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive study including genome-wide and 
transcriptome-wide association analyses to identify genetic loci associated with 
immunoglobulin G antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using 
serological data from 7924 European ancestry participants in the UK Biobank 
cohort.
RESULTS: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the 
landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 
independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across 
viral families. We identified specific amino acid (AA) residues that are 
associated with seroreactivity, the strongest associations presented in a range 
of AA positions within DRβ1 at positions 11, 13, 71, and 74 for Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpesvirus 7, (HHV7), and 
Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 
novel genetic loci outside the HLA associated with viral antibody response 
(P < 5.0 × 10-8), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), 
STING1 (5q31.2) for MCV, and CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for HHV7. 
Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with 
response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: 
P = 5.0 × 10-15 (MCV), NTN5: P = 1.1 × 10-9 (BKV), and P2RY13: P = 1.1 × 10-8 
EBV nuclear antigen. We also demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response 
genes and complex diseases, from autoimmune disorders to cancer to 
neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host 
response to viral infection and elucidates novel genetic determinants beyond the 
HLA that contribute to host-virus interaction.
