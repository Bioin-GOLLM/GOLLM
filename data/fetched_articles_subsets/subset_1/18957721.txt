Migraine is a debilitating disorder affecting a large proportion of the 
population. The effect of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (GeneID: 4524) 
polymorphisms in migraine etiology and development has been a theme of great 
interest. Several populations were evaluated with contradictory results. In this 
case-control study, we investigated the effect of the C677T polymorphism in 
MTHFR, as a genetic risk factor for migraine, in the Portuguese population. We 
observed that, overall, there was no significant difference in the frequencies 
of MTHFR C677T genotypes or of the T-allele among the Portuguese migraineurs 
when compared to controls. There was also no association of migraine with aura 
with MTHFR genotypes or with the T-allele, in contrast with previous studies. 
Regarding the risk of the T-allele homozygote carriers, there was an equal 
probability to develop migraine with aura over migraine without aura in our 
patients. Thus, we conclude that the C677T MTHFR polymorphism, responsible for a 
reduction of the MTHFR activity in folate metabolism, is not a major genetic 
susceptibility factor for migraine in the Portuguese population.
