Cellular metabolism generates molecular damage affecting all levels of 
biological organization. Accumulation of this damage over time is thought to 
play a central role in the aging process, but damage manifests in diverse 
molecular forms complicating its assessment. Insufficient attention has been 
paid to date to the role of molecular damage in aging-related phenotypes, 
particularly in humans, in part because of the difficulty in measuring its 
various forms. Recently, omics approaches have been developed that begin to 
address this challenge, because they are able to assess a sizeable proportion of 
age-related damage at the level of small molecules, proteins, RNA, DNA, 
organelles and cells. This review describes the concept of molecular damage in 
aging and discusses its diverse aspects from theoretical models to experimental 
approaches. Measurement of multiple types of damage enables studies of the role 
of damage in human aging outcomes and lays a foundation for testing 
interventions to reduce the burden of molecular damage, opening new approaches 
to slowing aging and reducing its consequences.
