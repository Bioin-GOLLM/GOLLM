Adamson et al. report that BRCA2 mutation carriers inheriting RAD52 S346X 
variant have reduced breast cancer risk. The RAD52 S346X variant lacks the 
nuclear localization sequence, which mislocalizes the protein to the cytoplasm 
and renders it nonfunctional. Combined loss of BRCA2-mediated DNA repair by 
homologous recombination and RAD52-mediated single-strand annealing may result 
in cell death and reduce breast cancer risk. Comment on:
