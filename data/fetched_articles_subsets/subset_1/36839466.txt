Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus, has caused outbreaks 
in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and, more recently, in the Americas. ZIKV has been 
associated with the neurological autoimmune disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome in 
adults and congenital Zika syndrome in fetuses and infants, including 
microcephaly, spontaneous abortion, and intrauterine growth restriction. It is 
considered to be a major threat to global public health due to its unprecedented 
clinical impact on humans. Currently, there are no specific prophylactics or 
therapeutics available to prevent or treat ZIKV infection. The development of a 
safe and efficacious ZIKV vaccine remains a global health priority. Since the 
recent outbreak, multiple platforms have been used in the development of 
candidate ZIKV vaccines. The candidate vaccines have been shown to elicit strong 
T cell and neutralization antibody responses and protect against ZIKV infection 
in animal models. Some candidates have progressed successfully to clinical 
trials. Live-attenuated vaccines, which induce rapid and durable protective 
immunity, are one of the most important strategies for controlling flavivirus 
diseases. In this review, we discuss recent progress in the development of 
candidate live-attenuated ZIKV vaccines.
