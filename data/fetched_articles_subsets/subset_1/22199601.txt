The binuclear molecule of the title compound, 
[Hf(2)(C(10)H(6)F(3)O(2))(6)(OH)(2)]·2C(3)H(7)NO, lies across an inversion 
centre and contains a Hf(IV) atom which is eight-coordinated and surrounded by 
three chelating β-diketonato tris-(4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-acetyl-acetonate 
(tfba(-)) ligands and two bridging OH(-) groups in a distorted 
square-anti-prismatic geometry. The Hf-O bond lengths vary from 2.073 (2) to 
2.244 (2) Å and the O-Hf-O bite angles vary from 73.49 (9) to 75.60 (9)°. Weak 
O-H⋯O hydrogen-bonding inter-actions are observed between the bridging hy-droxy 
groups and the dimethylformamide solvent mol-ecules. The unit cell contains 
solvent-accessible voids of 131 Å(3), but the residual electron density in the 
difference Fourier map suggests no solvent mol-ecule occupies this void.
