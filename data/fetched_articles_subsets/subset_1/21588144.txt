In the title compound, [Ag(NO(3))(C(18)H(14)N(4))](n), the Ag(I) atom is 
coordinated by two N atoms from two 
N,N'-bis-(3-pyridyl-methyl-idene)benzene-1,4-diamine (bpbd) mol-ecules and two O 
atoms from a bidentate nitrate anion. The bpbd mol-ecules bridge the Ag atoms 
into a chain. Two adjacent chains are further connected by Ag⋯Ag inter-actions 
[3.1631 (8) Å], forming a double-chain structure. A π-π inter-action 
[centroid-centroid distance = 3.758 (3) Å] occurs between the double chains. 
Inter-chain C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds are observed.
