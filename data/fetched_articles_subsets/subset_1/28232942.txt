Objective. With depression being present in approximately 20% of people with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we expect equally frequent prescription of 
antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics. Nevertheless, prescription data in 
people with T2DM is missing and the effect of depression on glycaemic control is 
contradictory. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of 
antidepressants, anxiolytics, and/or hypnotics use in a large, managed, primary 
care system cohort of people with T2DM and to determine the sociodemographic 
characteristics, comorbidities, T2DM medication, and metabolic control 
associated with its use. Method. The prevalence of antidepressants, anxiolytics, 
and/or hypnotics use in the years 2007-2012 was assessed in the Hoorn Diabetes 
Care System Cohort from the Netherlands. Results. From the 7016 people with 
T2DM, 500 people (7.1%) used antidepressants only, 456 people (6.5%) used 
anxiolytics and/or hypnotics only, and 254 people (3.6%) used a combination. 
Conclusion. We conclude that in our managed, primary care system 17% of all 
people with T2DM used antidepressants, anxiolytics, and/or hypnotics. Users of 
antidepressants, anxiolytics, and/or hypnotics were more often female, 
non-Caucasian, lower educated, and more often treated with insulin.
