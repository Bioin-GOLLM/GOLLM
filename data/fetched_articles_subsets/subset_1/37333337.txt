The integration of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with disease genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) has proven successful at prioritizing candidate genes 
at disease-associated loci. QTL mapping has mainly been focused on multi-tissue 
expression QTL or plasma protein QTL (pQTL). Here we generated the 
largest-to-date cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pQTL atlas by analyzing 7,028 proteins 
in 3,107 samples. We identified 3,373 independent study-wide associations for 
1,961 proteins, including 2,448 novel pQTLs of which 1,585 are unique to CSF, 
demonstrating unique genetic regulation of the CSF proteome. In addition to the 
established chr6p22.2-21.32 HLA region, we identified pleiotropic regions on 
chr3q28 near OSTN and chr19q13.32 near APOE that were enriched for 
neuron-specificity and neurological development. We also integrated this pQTL 
atlas with the latest Alzheimer's disease (AD) GWAS through PWAS, colocalization 
and Mendelian Randomization and identified 42 putative causal proteins for AD, 
15 of which have drugs available. Finally, we developed a proteomics-based risk 
score for AD that outperforms genetics-based polygenic risk scores. These 
findings will be instrumental to further understand the biology and identify 
causal and druggable proteins for brain and neurological traits.
