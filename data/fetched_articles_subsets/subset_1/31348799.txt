We present a lab-in-the-field experiment and surveys of marginalised Roma 
children in Slovakia to examine whether reminding Roma of their ethnicity 
reduces their performance in a cognitive task. Research on social identity and 
stereotypes has documented that when individuals feel that their social group is 
negatively stereotyped in a domain, their performance declines, which can 
reinforce discrimination. In an effort to break the cycle of negative 
stereotypes, we remind Roma subjects of either Roma or non-Roma role models. We 
find that the activation of a Roma's ethnicity reduces cognitive performance. In 
contrast, Roma exposed to Roma role models outperform those reminded of their 
ethnicity and of non-Roma role models. We then attempt to understand the 
channels through which social identity and role models affect performance. We 
show that priming the identity of a Roma has a direct effect on confidence, 
decreasing performance.
