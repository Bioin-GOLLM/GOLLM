Recently we identified a P408S, P415L allele of beta-glucuronidase in several 
Mexican patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (Sly syndrome) and 
presented evidence that both mutations are required to produce the MPS VII 
allele (Islam et al., 1996). In an attempt to determine whether either of these 
mutations exists as a benign polymorphism among Mexicans, we developed a PCR 
method to screen simultaneously for both mutations and used it to screen a 
population sample of 187 Mexican individuals in the Guadalajara area, all from 
the north-western states of Mexico. Neither mutation was present in 374 alleles 
studied. In addition, we had the opportunity to carry out prenatal diagnosis in 
a fetus at risk for homozygosity for this MPS VII allele at the 15th week of 
gestation using enzymatic assays as well as by analysis of genomic DNA isolated 
from cultured amniotic fluid cells. The fetus was found to be heterozygous for 
the P408S, P415L allele. The newborn's heterozygosity was confirmed after birth 
by enzyme assays on plasma and leukocytes, and by analysis of DNA from 
leukocytes.
