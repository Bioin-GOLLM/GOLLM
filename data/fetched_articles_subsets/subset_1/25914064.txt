BACKGROUND: The glutamatergic system is essential for learning and memory 
through its crucial role in neural development and synaptic plasticity. Genes 
associated with the glutamatergic system, including metabotropic glutamate 
receptor (mGluR or GRM) genes, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
schizophrenia. Few studies, however, have investigated a relationship between 
polymorphism of glutamate-related genes and cortical function in vivo in 
patients with schizophrenia. We thus explored an association between genetic 
variations in GRM3 and brain activation driven by a cognitive task in the 
prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one outpatients with schizophrenia and 48 healthy 
controls participated in this study. We measured four candidate single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (rs274622, rs2299225, rs1468412, and rs6465084) of 
GRM3, and activity in the prefrontal and temporal cortices during a category 
version of a verbal fluency task, using a 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy 
instrument.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The rs274622 C carriers with schizophrenia were 
associated with significantly smaller prefrontal activation than patients with 
TT genotype. This between-genotype difference tended to be confined to the 
patient group. GRM3 polymorphisms are associated with prefrontal activation 
during cognitive task in schizophrenia.
