Hypoxia leads to up-regulation of PD-L1 and decreases T lymphocyte infiltration, 
thus boosting immunotherapeutic resistance of tumors. Moreover, 
tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
(MDSCs) correlate with potent immune suppressive activity and resistance to the 
immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) in tumor sites. Here, a multifunctional 
nanoregulator incorporating MnO2 particles and small molecular IPI549 is 
developed, which can reshape the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to unleash 
the immune system. The intravenously administered nanoregulator effectively 
accumulates in tumor sites to alleviate hypoxia via oxygen-generating reduction 
of MnO2 and to inhibit PI3Kγ on MDSCs via IPI549 release in the tumor 
microenvironment (TME), which results in concurrent downregulation of PD-L1 
expression, polarization of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) toward 
pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype (tumor-suppressive), enhanced infiltration of 
CD4+ helper T lymphocytes (Th cells), and cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (Tc 
cells), and suppressed infiltration of regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg cells) for 
effective tumor immunotherapy. Furthermore, the local generation of Mn2+ in TME 
allows tumor-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). More excitingly, the 
nanoregulator-reshaped TIME is effectively reserved due to the synergistic 
effect of hypoxia alleviation and MDSC PI3Kγ inhibition, leading to remarkable 
post-medication inhibition of tumor re-growth and metastasis in an animal study.
