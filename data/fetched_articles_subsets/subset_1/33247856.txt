BACKGROUND: This study was aimed at investigating the effects of long noncoding 
RNA (lncRNA) LINC02323 in ovarian cancer and its possible mechanism.
METHODS: Microarray analysis and QPCR were utilized to identify lncRNA LINC02323 
expression in patients with ovarian cancer. MTT assay was used for analysis of 
ovarian cancer cell proliferation. Western blot was utilized to investigate its 
possible mechanism.
RESULTS: In patients with ovarian cancer, lncRNA LINC02323 expression was 
up-regulated and miR-1343-3p expression was down-regulated. Over-expression of 
lncRNA LINC02323 promoted cell growth and reduced LDH activity levels in vitro 
model by suppression of miR-1343-3p expression. Down-regulation of lncRNA 
LINC02323 reduced cell growth and increased LDH activity levels in vitro model 
by induction of miR-1343-3p expression. Over-expression of miR-1343-3p reduced 
cell growth and reduced LDH activity levels in vitro model by suppression of 
TGF-β receptor. Down-regulation of miR-1343-3p promoted cell growth and reduced 
LDH activity levels in vitro model by induced of TGF-β receptor.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that Novel long noncoding RNA LINC02323 promotes 
cell growth of ovarian cancer via TGF-β receptor 1 by miR-1343-3p.
