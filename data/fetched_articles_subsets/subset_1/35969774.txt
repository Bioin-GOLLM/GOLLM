Dynamic regulation of mitochondrial morphology provides cells with the 
flexibility required to adapt and respond to electron transport chain (ETC) 
toxins and mitochondrial DNA-linked disease mutations, yet the mechanisms 
underpinning the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics machinery by these stimuli 
is poorly understood. Here, we show that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) 
is genetically required for cells to undergo rapid mitochondrial fragmentation 
when challenged with ETC toxins. Moreover, PDK4 overexpression was sufficient to 
promote mitochondrial fission even in the absence of mitochondrial stress. 
Importantly, we observed that the PDK4-mediated regulation of mitochondrial 
fission was independent of its canonical function, i.e., inhibitory 
phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Phosphoproteomic 
screen for PDK4 substrates, followed by nonphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic 
mutations of the PDK4 site revealed cytoplasmic GTPase, Septin 2 (SEPT2), as the 
key effector molecule that acts as a receptor for DRP1 in the outer 
mitochondrial membrane to promote mitochondrial fission. Conversely, inhibition 
of the PDK4-SEPT2 axis could restore the balance in mitochondrial dynamics and 
reinvigorates cellular respiration in mitochondrial fusion factor, mitofusin 
2-deficient cells. Furthermore, PDK4-mediated mitochondrial reshaping limits 
mitochondrial bioenergetics and supports cancer cell growth. Our results 
identify the PDK4-SEPT2-DRP1 axis as a regulator of mitochondrial function at 
the interface between cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial dynamics.
