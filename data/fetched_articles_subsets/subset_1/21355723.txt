BACKGROUND: Intensive insulin therapy has been associated with weight gain and 
increased hypoglycemia. In this pilot study, we determined the effect of 
optimized insulin therapy on weight gain and frequency of hypoglycemia in 
patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: Sixteen patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes participated in an 
interventional clinical trial. Before any pharmacologic intervention began, 
diabetes management was optimized by thorough review of carbohydrate counting 
and insulin dose adjustment.
RESULTS: Optimizing insulin therapy and carbohydrate counting for 4-6 months 
decreased the enrollees' hemoglobin A1C (-0.7 ± 0.6%, P = 0.0003) without weight 
gain (-0.6 ± 2.9 kg, P = 0.44) or increased frequency of hypoglycemia (-0.5 ± 
1.5 events per week, P = 0.22). The improved blood glucose control was achieved 
in most subjects by lowering their basal or long-acting insulin doses while 
making compensatory increases in meal-associated insulin doses.
CONCLUSIONS: "Fine tuning" of diabetes management with intensive insulin therapy 
was accomplished without inducing weight gain or worsening hypoglycemia. This 
was achieved by readjusting the ratio of basal to meal-associated insulin 
without increasing the total daily insulin dose.
