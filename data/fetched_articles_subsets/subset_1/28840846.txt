BACKGROUND: The humoral system is activated and various cytokines are released 
due to infections in tissues and traumatic damage. Nuclear factor-kappa B dimers 
are encoded by nuclear factor-kappa B genes and regulate transcription of 
several crucial proteins of inflammation such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha.
AIMS: To investigate the possible effect of polymorphisms on tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha serum levels with clinical and prognostic parameters of sepsis by 
determining the nuclear factor-kappa B-1-94 ins/del ATTG and tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha (-308 G/A) gene polymorphisms and tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
serum levels.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study.
METHODS: Seventy-two patients with sepsis and 104 healthy controls were included 
in the study. In order to determine the polymorphisms of nuclear factor-kappa 
B-1-94 ins/del ATTG and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (-308 G/A), polymerase 
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed 
and serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: We observed no significant differences in tumour necrosis factor-alpha 
serum levels between the study groups. In the patient group, an increase in the 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha serum levels in patients carrying the tumour 
necrosis factor-alpha (-308 G/A) A allele compared to those without the A allele 
was found to be statistically significant. Additionally, an increase in the 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha serum levels in patients carrying tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha (-308 G/A) AA genotype compared with patients carrying the AG or GG 
genotypes was statistically significant. No significant differences were found 
in these 2 polymorphisms between the patient and control groups (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results showed the AA genotype and the A allele of the tumour 
necrosis factor-alpha (-308 G/A) polymorphism may be used as a predictor of 
elevated tumour necrosis factor-alpha levels in patients with sepsis.
