OBJECTIVE: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and pre-eclampsia (PE) are 
immune-related pregnancy complications that have been linked to CD4+ T cells and 
their cytokines, which can be influenced by genetic polymorphisms. This 
meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between interleukin (IL)-17 
and -27 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to RPL and PE.
METHODS: All eligible case-control studies published up to February 2023 were 
identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google 
Scholar. The risk of recurrent pregnancy loss and PE associated with the IL-17 
rs2275913, IL-17 rs763780, IL-27 rs153109, and IL-27 rs17855750 polymorphisms 
were estimated for each study.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis incorporated a total of 13 studies. The overall 
analysis indicated that IL-17 rs2275913, IL-17 rs763780, IL-27 rs153109, and 
IL-27 rs17855750 polymorphisms were not significantly associated with 
immune-related pregnancy complications, including RPL and PE. However, when the 
analysis was stratified by disease type, the IL-17 rs2275913 polymorphism was 
found to be associated with an increased risk of RPL (recessive model 
AA/GA + GG: OR = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-2.49, p = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: The IL-17 rs763780, IL-27 rs153109, and IL-27 rs17855750 
polymorphisms were not significantly associated with RPL and PE, whereas the 
IL-17 rs2275913 polymorphism was associated with the susceptibility to recurrent 
miscarriage.
