The cytohesin proteins, consisting of four closely related members 
(cytohesins-1, -2, -3, and -4), are a subfamily of the Sec7 domain-containing 
guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs), which 
are critical regulators of membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton 
remodeling. Recent advances in molecular biological techniques and the 
development of a specific pharmacological inhibitor for cytohesins, SecinH3, 
have revealed the functional involvement of the cytohesin-Arf pathway in diverse 
neuronal functions from the formation of axons and dendrites, axonal 
pathfinding, and synaptic vesicle recycling, to pathophysiological processes 
including chronic pain and neurotoxicity induced by proteins related to 
neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
Alzheimer's disease. Here, we review the physiological and pathological roles of 
the cytohesin-Arf pathway in neurons and discuss the future directions of this 
research field.
