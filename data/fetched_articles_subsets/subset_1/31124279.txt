Lysine-specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) demethylates trimethylated lysine-27 on 
histone H3. The methylation and demethylation of histone proteins affects gene 
expression during development. Pathogenic alterations in histone lysine 
methylation and demethylation genes have been associated with multiple 
neurodevelopmental disorders. We have identified a number of de novo alterations 
in the KDM6B gene via whole exome sequencing (WES) in a cohort of 12 unrelated 
patients with developmental delay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic facial 
features, and other clinical findings. Our findings will allow for further 
investigation in to the role of the KDM6B gene in human neurodevelopmental 
disorders.
