BACKGROUND: Predictive biomarkers of response to chemotherapy plus 
antiangiogenic for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are lacking. The 
objective of this study was to test the prognostic role of splenomegaly on 
baseline CT scan.
METHODS: This study is a sub-study of PRODIGE-9 study, which included 488 mCRC 
patients treated by 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and 
bevacizumab in first line. The association between splenic volume, and PFS and 
OS was evaluated by univariate and multivariable Cox analyses. The relation 
between circulating monocytic Myeloid derived suppressor cells (mMDSC) and 
splenomegaly was also determined.
RESULTS: Baseline splenic volume > 180 mL was associated with poor PFS (median 
PFS = 9.2 versus 11.1 months; log-rank p = 0.0125), but was not statistically 
associated with OS (median OS = 22.6 versus 28.5 months; log-rank p = 0.1643). 
The increase in splenic volume at 3 months had no impact on PFS (HR 0.928; 
log-rank p = 0.56) or on OS (HR 0.843; log-rank p = 0.21). Baseline splenic 
volume was positively correlated with the level of baseline circulating mMDSC (r 
= 0.48, p-value = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: Baseline splenomegaly is a prognostic biomarker in patients with 
mCRC treated with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab, and a surrogate marker of MDSC 
accumulation.
