Alphaviruses are emerging and reemerging viruses that cause disease syndromes 
ranging from incapacitating arthritis to potentially fatal encephalitis. While 
infection by arthritogenic and encephalitic alphaviruses results in distinct 
clinical manifestations, both virus groups induce robust innate and adaptive 
immune responses. However, differences in cellular tropism, type I interferon 
induction, immune cell recruitment, and B and T cell responses result in 
differential disease progression and outcome. In this review, we discuss aspects 
of immune responses that contribute to protective or pathogenic outcomes after 
alphavirus infection.
