We determined the role of carboxyl-terminal regulation of NOPR (nociceptin, 
orphanin FQ receptor) signaling and function. We mutated C-terminal serine and 
threonine residues and examined their role in NOPR trafficking, homologous 
desensitization, and arrestin-dependent MAPK signaling. The NOPR agonist, 
nociceptin, caused robust NOPR-YFP receptor internalization, peaking at 30 min. 
Mutation of serine 337, 346, and 351, had no effect on NOPR internalization. 
However, mutation of C-terminal threonine 362, serine 363, and threonine 365 
blocked nociceptin-induced internalization of NOPR. Furthermore, point mutation 
of only Ser-363 was sufficient to block NOPR internalization. Homologous 
desensitization of NOPR-mediated calcium channel blockade and inhibition of cAMP 
were also shown to require Ser-363. Additionally, NOPR internalization was 
absent when GRK3, and Arrestin3 were knocked down using siRNA, but not when GRK2 
and Arrestin2 were knocked down. We also found that nociceptin-induced 
NOPR-mediated JNK but not ERK signaling requires Ser-363, GRK3, and Arrestin3. 
Dominant-positive Arrestin3 but not Arrestin2 was sufficient to rescue 
NOPR-S363A internalization and JNK signaling. These findings suggest that NOPR 
function may be regulated by GRK3 phosphorylation of Ser-363 and Arrestin3 and 
further demonstrates the complex nature of G-protein-dependent and -independent 
signaling in opioid receptors.
