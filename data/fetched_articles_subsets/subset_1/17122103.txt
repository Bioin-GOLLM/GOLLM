PURPOSE: Thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) expression is upregulated in the orbits of 
patients with Graves ophthalmopathy (GO), most of whom have TSHR-stimulating 
antibodies. The authors investigated the biological effects of TSHR activation 
in vitro in adipose tissue, the site of orbital TSHR expression.
METHODS: Activating mutant TSHR (TSHR*) or wild-type (WT) was introduced into 
human orbital preadipocytes using retroviral vectors. Their proliferation 
(Coulter counting), basal cAMP accumulation (radioimmunoassay), and spontaneous 
and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARgamma)-induced adipogenesis 
(quantitative oil red O staining) were assessed and compared with those of 
nonmodified cells. QRT-PCR was used to measure transcripts of CCAT/enhancer 
binding protein (C/EBP)beta, PPARgamma, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL; early, 
intermediate, and late markers of adipogenesis) and for uncoupling protein 
(UCP)-1 (brown adipose tissue [BAT]).
RESULTS: Expression of TSHR* significantly inhibited the proliferation of 
preadipocytes and produced an increase in unstimulated cAMP of 200% to 600%. 
Basal lipid levels were significantly increased in TSHR* (127%-275%) compared 
with nonmodified (100%) or WT-expressing (104%-187%) cells. This was accompanied 
by 2- to 10-fold increases in early-intermediate markers and UCP-1 transcripts 
(2- to 8-fold); LPL was at the limit of detection. In nonmodified cells, 
adipogenesis produced significant increases in transcripts of all markers, 
including LPL (approximately 30-fold). This was not the case in TSHR*-expressing 
cells, which also displayed 67% to 84% reductions in lipid levels.
CONCLUSIONS: TSHR activation stimulates early differentiation (favoring BAT 
formation?) but renders preadipocytes refractory to PPARgamma-induced 
adipogenesis. In neither case did lipid-containing vacuoles accumulate, 
suggesting that terminal stages of differentiation were inhibited.
