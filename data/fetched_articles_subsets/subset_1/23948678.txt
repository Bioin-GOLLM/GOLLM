INTRODUCTION: Human synpolydactyly (SPD), belonging to syndactyly (SD) II, is 
caused by mutations in homeobox d13 (HOXD13). Here, we describe the study of a 
two-generation Chinese family with a variant form of synpolydactyly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sequence of the HOXD13 gene was analyzed. Luciferase 
assays were conducted to determine whether the mutation affected the function of 
the HOXD13 protein.
RESULTS: We identified a novel c.659G>C (p.Gly220Ala) mutation outside the 
HOXD13 homeodomain responsible for the disease in this family. This mutation was 
not found in any of the unaffected family members and healthy control. 
Luciferase assays demonstrated that this mutation affected the transcriptional 
activation ability of HOXD13 (only approximately 84.7% of wild type, p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Phenotypes displayed by individuals carrying the novel mutation 
present additional features, such as the fifth finger clinodactyly, which is not 
always associated with canonical SPD. This finding enhances our understanding 
about the phenotypic spectrum associated with HOXD13 mutations and advances our 
understanding of human limb development.
