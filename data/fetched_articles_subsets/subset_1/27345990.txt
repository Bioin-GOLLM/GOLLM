We report here the generation of human iPS cell line UKKi009-A from dermal 
fibroblasts of a patient carrying heterozygous mutation 
c.3035-3045delTCCCTCGATGC, p.Leu1012Pro (fs*55) in KCNH2 gene leading to long QT 
syndrome type 2 (LQT2). We used the Sleeping Beauty transposon-based plasmids 
expressing OSKM along with microRNAs 307/367 to reprogram the fibroblasts. The 
iPS cells possess pluripotent stem cell characteristics and differentiate to 
cell lineages of all three germ layers. This cell line can serve as a source for 
in vitro modeling of LQT2. This cell line is distributed by the European 
Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC).
