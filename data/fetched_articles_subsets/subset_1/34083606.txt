Lynch Syndrome (LS) prevalence in underrepresented minorities are lacking. The 
objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of LS in a minority patient 
population. Secondary objectives included identifying factors associated with 
successful LS screening and to characterize clinicopathologic features. Women 
with endometrial cancer treated within a university system from 2014 and 2016 
were included. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 
were obtained from medical records and clinicopathologic factors abstracted. 
Patients not previously screened for LS were screened. 276 patients were 
evaluable. More minority women were screened as part of their routine cancer 
care (p = 0.005). Additionally, women 50 years or younger were more likely to be 
screened for LS compared to women older than 51(p = 0.009) and uninsured or 
reliant on Medicaid patients (p = 0.011) were more likely to be screened during 
routine care. Six patients received confirmatory germline testing for LS (4.3%), 
and another 8 patients had a staining pattern suggestive of LS. In an 
underrepresented population, the rate of LS in endometrial cancer is similar to 
previous reports. LS may be under diagnosed and opportunities missed when 
universal screening is not applied in minority women.
