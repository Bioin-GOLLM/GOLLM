High-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) 
and spectral karyotyping (SKY) were applied to a panel of malignant mesothelioma 
(MMt) cell lines. SKY has not been applied to MMt before, and complete 
karyotypes are reported based on the integration of SKY and aCGH results. A 
whole genome search for homozygous deletions (HDs) produced the largest set of 
recurrent and non-recurrent HDs for MMt (52 recurrent HDs in 10 genomic regions; 
36 non-recurrent HDs). For the first time, LINGO2, RBFOX1/A2BP1, RPL29, DUSP7, 
and CCSER1/FAM190A were found to be homozygously deleted in MMt, and some of 
these genes could be new tumor suppressor genes for MMt. Integration of SKY and 
aCGH data allowed reconstruction of chromosomal rearrangements that led to the 
formation of HDs. Our data imply that only with acquisition of structural and/or 
numerical karyotypic instability can MMt cells attain a complete loss of tumor 
suppressor genes located in 9p21.3, which is the most frequently homozygously 
deleted region. Tetraploidization is a late event in the karyotypic progression 
of MMt cells, after HDs in the 9p21.3 region have already been acquired.
