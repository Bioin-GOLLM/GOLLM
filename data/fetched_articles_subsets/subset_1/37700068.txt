Usher syndrome (USH) is the leading cause of combined deafness and blindness, 
with USH2A being the most prevalent form. The mechanisms responsible for this 
debilitating sensory impairment remain unclear. This study focuses on 
characterizing the auditory phenotype in a mouse model expressing the c.2290delG 
mutation in usherin equivalent to human frameshift mutation c.2299delG. 
Previously we described how this model reproduces patient's retinal phenotypes. 
Here, we present the cochlear phenotype, showing that the mutant usherin, is 
expressed during early postnatal stages. The c.2290delG mutation results in a 
truncated protein that is mislocalized within the cell body of the hair cells. 
The knock-in model also exhibits congenital hearing loss that remains consistent 
throughout the animal's lifespan. Structurally, the stereocilia bundles, 
particularly in regions associated with functional hearing loss, are 
disorganized. Our findings shed light on the role of usherin in maintaining 
structural support, specifically in longer inner hair cell stereocilia, during 
development, which is crucial for proper bundle organization and hair cell 
function. Overall, we present a genetic mouse model with cochlear defects 
associated with the c.2290delG mutation, providing insights into the etiology of 
hearing loss and offering potential avenues for the development of effective 
therapeutic treatments for USH2A patients.
