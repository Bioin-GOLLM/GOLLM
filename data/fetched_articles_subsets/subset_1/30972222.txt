Cluster of differentiation (CD)1 molecules are a highly conserved family of 
MCH-like transmembrane glycoproteins that bind lipid and glycolipid antigens and 
present a diverse range of microbial and self-glycolipids to antigen-specific T 
cells. The current study aimed to find out the impact of CD1A and CD1D 
polymorphisms on pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). This case-control study 
encompassed 172 PTB patients and 180 healthy subjects. Genotyping of CD1A and 
CD1D variants was achieved using the polymerase chain reaction restriction 
fragment length polymorphism method. The results revealed that CD1A rs411089 
variant significantly increased the risk of PTB in recessive model [odds ratio 
(OR)=2.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.38-5.57, CC vs. TT+TC, P=0.005]. CD1D 
rs859009 polymorphism significantly reduced the risk of PTB in heterozygous 
codominant (OR=0.50, 95% CI=0.29-0.86, P=0.011, GC vs. GG) and dominant 
(OR=0.53, 95% CI=0.31-0.88, P=0.019, GC+CC vs. GG) inheritance model. The CD1A 
rs366316, CD1D rs973742 and CD1D rs859010 were not associated with the 
risk/protection from PTB (P>0.05). The results of the present study suggest that 
CD1A rs411089 and CD1D rs859009 but not CD1A rs366316, CD1D rs973742 and CD1D 
rs859010 polymorphisms are associated with PTB in a sample of the Iranian 
population. Further investigation with different ethnicities and larger sample 
sizes are necessary to certify the findings of the present study.
