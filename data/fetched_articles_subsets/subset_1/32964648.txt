INTRODUCTION: Traditionally used laboratory methods do not always accurately 
reflect bleeding severity in hemophilia A (HA) patients. The ability of three 
global assays for identifying patients with unexpected bleeding phenotype was 
investigated.
METHODS: Overall hemostasis potential (OHP), aPTT-clot waveform analysis 
(aPTT-CWA), endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), FVIII activities, and 
prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 concentrations were measured in 62 HA patients (30 
severe and 32 non-severe) and 27 male controls. Bleeding phenotype was 
determined using our proposed scoring system including age at first joint bleed, 
number of target joints, and number of joint/muscle bleeds per year. Bleeding 
score ≤ 4 defined patients with mild bleeding phenotype (N = 27); score ≥ 5 
defined severe bleeding phenotype (N = 35).
RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristic analysis performed for 
distinguishing patients with severe and mild bleeding phenotype yielded 
following values of area under the curve: 0.910 (FVIII); 0.891 (aPTT-CWA 
parameter DELTA); 0.769 (OHP); and 0.634 (ETP). Unexpected bleeding phenotype 
was identified in 11/62 HA patients: 8/32 (25%) non-severe HA patients had 
severe, while 3/30 (10%) severe HA patients had mild bleeding phenotype, and 
global assays enabled the identification of all these patients. OHP and DELTA 
were revealed as the most reliable parameters for bleeding phenotype 
determination (10/11 and 9/11 unexpected results, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes OHP and aPTT-CWA as a powerful laboratory 
diagnostic tool in identifying HA patients with unexpected bleeding 
presentations, with the best results achieved by combining both assays. Global 
assays should not completely replace FVIII activity measurement but should be a 
part of the HA diagnostic algorithm.
