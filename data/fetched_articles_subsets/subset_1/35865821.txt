BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella 
pneumoniae are difficult to control. Virulence and antibiotic resistance genes 
contribute to infection, but the mechanisms associated with the transition from 
colonization to infection remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the transition from carriage to infection by K. 
pneumoniae isolates carrying the K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-encoding gene bla 
KPC (KpKPC).
METHODS: KpKPC isolates detected within a 10-year period in a single 
tertiary-care hospital were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 
(PFGE), multilocus sequencing typing, capsular lipopolysaccharide and 
polysaccharide typing, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and the presence 
of virulence genes. The gastrointestinal load of carbapenem-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae and of bla KPC-carrying bacteria was estimated by relative 
quantification in rectal swabs. Results were evaluated as contributors to the 
progression from carriage to infection.
RESULTS: No PGFE type; ST-, K-, or O-serotypes; antimicrobial susceptibility 
profiles; or the presence of virulence markers, such yersiniabactin and 
colibactin, were associated with carriage or infection, with ST437 and ST11 
being the most prevalent clones. Admission to intensive and semi-intensive care 
units was a risk factor for the development of infections (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.375 
to 5.687, P=0.005), but higher intestinal loads of carbapenem-resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae or of bla KPC-carrying bacteria were the only factors 
associated with the transition from colonization to infection in this cohort (OR 
8.601, 95% CI 2.44 to 30.352, P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The presence of resistance and virulence mechanisms were not 
associated with progression from colonization to infection, while intestinal 
colonization by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacea and, more specifically, 
the load of gastrointestinal carriage emerged as an important determinant of 
infection.
