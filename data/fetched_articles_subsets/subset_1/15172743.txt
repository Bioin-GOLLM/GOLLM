In this review, evidence is provided that apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype 
accounts for the majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and pathology. The 
three major human isoforms, apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, are encoded by different 
alleles (2, 3, 4) and regulate lipid metabolism and redistribution. ApoE 
isoforms differ in their effects on AD risk and pathology. Clinical and 
epidemiological data have indicated that the 4 allele may account for 50% of AD 
in the United States. Further, the rarity of AD among carriers of the 2 allele 
suggests that allelic variations in the gene encoding this protein may account 
for over 95% of AD cases. ApoE4 disrupts memory function in rodents. Further 
studies have indicated that fragments of apoE may contribute to both plaque and 
tangle formation. Thus, the epidemiologic and basic science evidence suggest 
that apoE genotype accounts for the vast majority of AD risk and pathology.
