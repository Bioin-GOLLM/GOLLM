Trans-activation response DNA-binding protein of 43  kDa (TDP-43) regulates RNA 
processing and forms neuropathological aggregates in patients with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Investigating TDP-43 
post-translational modifications, we discovered that K84 acetylation reduced 
nuclear import whereas K136 acetylation impaired RNA binding and splicing 
capabilities of TDP-43. Such failure of RNA interaction triggered TDP-43 phase 
separation mediated by the C-terminal low complexity domain, leading to the 
formation of insoluble aggregates with pathologically phosphorylated and 
ubiquitinated TDP-43. Introduction of acetyl-lysine at the identified sites via 
amber suppression confirmed the results from site-directed mutagenesis. 
K84-acetylated TDP-43 showed cytoplasmic mislocalization, and the aggregation 
propensity of K136-acetylated TDP-43 was confirmed. We generated antibodies 
selective for TDP-43 acetylated at these lysines, and found that sirtuin-1 can 
potently deacetylate K136-acetylated TDP-43 and reduce its aggregation 
propensity. Thus, distinct lysine acetylations modulate nuclear import, RNA 
binding and phase separation of TDP-43, suggesting regulatory mechanisms for 
TDP-43 pathogenesis.
