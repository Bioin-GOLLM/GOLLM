LoRaWAN is one of the low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies that have 
received significant attention by the research community in the recent years. It 
offers low-power, low-data rate communication over a wide range of covered area. 
In the past years, the number of publications regarding LoRa and LoRaWAN has 
grown tremendously. This paper provides an overview of research work that has 
been published from 2015 to September 2018 and that is accessible via Google 
Scholar and IEEE Explore databases. First, a detailed description of the 
technology is given, including existing security and reliability mechanisms. 
This literature overview is structured by categorizing papers according to the 
following topics: (i) physical layer aspects; (ii) network layer aspects; (iii) 
possible improvements; and (iv) extensions to the standard. Finally, a 
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis is presented 
along with the challenges that LoRa and LoRaWAN still face.
