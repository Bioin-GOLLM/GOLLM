In the over 100 years since the recognition of pulmonary hypertension (PH), 
immense progress and significant achievements have been made with regard to 
understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and its treatment. These 
advances have been mostly in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), 
which was classified as Group 1 Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) at the Second World 
Symposia on PH in 1998. However, the pathobiology of PH due to chronic lung 
disease, classified as Group 3 PH, remains poorly understood and its treatments 
thus remain limited. We review the history of the classification of the five 
groups of PH and aim to provide a state-of-the-art review of the understanding 
of the pathogenesis of Group 1 PH and Group 3 PH including insights gained from 
novel high-throughput omics technologies that have revealed heterogeneities 
within these categories as well as similarities between them. Leveraging the 
substantial gains made in understanding the genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, 
and metabolomics of PAH to understand the full spectrum of the complex, 
heterogeneous disease of PH is needed. Multimodal omics data as well as 
supervised and unbiased machine learning approaches after careful consideration 
of the powerful advantages as well as of the limitations and pitfalls of these 
technologies could lead to earlier diagnosis, more precise risk stratification, 
better predictions of disease response, new sub-phenotype groupings within types 
of PH, and identification of shared pathways between PAH and other types of PH 
that could lead to new treatment targets. © 2023 American Physiological Society.
