Binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) extends serum half-life of IgG, and 
antagonizing this interaction is a promising therapeutic approach in 
IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. Fc-MST-HN, designed for enhanced FcRn binding 
capacity, has not been evaluated in the context of a full-length antibody, and 
the structural properties of the attached Fab regions might affect the 
FcRn-mediated intracellular trafficking pathway. Here we present a comprehensive 
comparative analysis of the IgG salvage pathway between two full-size IgG1 
variants, containing wild type and MST-HN Fc fragments, and their Fc-only 
counterparts. We find no evidence of Fab-regions affecting FcRn binding in 
cell-free assays, however, cellular assays show impaired binding of full-size 
IgG to FcRn, which translates into improved intracellular FcRn occupancy and 
intracellular accumulation of Fc-MST-HN compared to full size IgG1-MST-HN. The 
crystal structure of Fc-MST-HN in complex with FcRn provides a plausible 
explanation why the Fab disrupts the interaction only in the context of 
membrane-associated FcRn. Importantly, we find that Fc-MST-HN outperforms 
full-size IgG1-MST-HN in reducing IgG levels in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Collectively, our findings identify the cellular membrane context as a critical 
factor in FcRn biology and therapeutic targeting.
