SV40 small t-antigen (ST) collaborates with SV40 large T-antigen (LT) and 
activated rasv12 to promote transformation in a variety of immortalized human 
cells. A number of oncogenes or the disruption of the general serine-threonine 
phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) can replace ST in this paradigm. 
However, the relationship between these oncogenes and PP2A activity is not 
clear. To address this, we queried the connectivity of these molecules in 
silico. We found that p27 was connected to each of those oncogenes that could 
substitute for ST. We further determined that p27 loss can substitute for the 
expression of ST during transformation of both rodent and human cells. 
Conversely, knock-in cells expressing the degradation-resistant S10A and T187A 
mutants of p27 were resistant to the transforming activities of ST. This 
suggests that p27 is an important target of the tumor-suppressive effects of 
PP2A and likely an important target of the multitude of cellular oncoproteins 
that emulate the transforming function of ST.
