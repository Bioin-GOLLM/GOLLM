BACKGROUND: Isolated left ventricular apical hypoplasia (ILVAH), also known as 
truncated left ventricle (LV), is a very unusual cardiomyopathy. It is 
characterised by a truncated, spherical, and non-apex forming LV. The true apex 
is occupied by the right ventricle. Due to the rarity of the disease, just a few 
case reports and limited case series have been published in the field.
AIM: To analysing the so far 37 reported ILVAH cases worldwide.
METHODS: The electronic databases PubMed and Scopus were investigated from their 
establishment up to December 13, 2022.
RESULTS: The majority of cases reported occurred in males (52.7%). Mean age at 
diagnosis was 26.1 ± 19.6 years. More than a third of the patients were 
asymptomatic (35.1%). The most usual clinical presentation was breathlessness 
(40.5%). The most commonly detected electrocardiogram changes were T wave 
abnormalities (29.7%) and right axis deviation with poor R wave progression 
(24.3%). Atrial fibrillation/flutter was detected in 24.3%. Echocardiography was 
performed in 97.3% of cases and cardiac MRI in 91.9% of cases. Ejection fraction 
was reduced in more than a half of patients (56.7%). An associated congenital 
heart disease was found in 16.2%. Heart failure therapy was administered in 
35.1% of patients. The outcome was favorable in the vast majority of patients, 
with just one death.
CONCLUSION: ILVAH is a multifaceted entity with a so far unpredictable course, 
ranging from benign until the elderly to sudden death during adolescence.
