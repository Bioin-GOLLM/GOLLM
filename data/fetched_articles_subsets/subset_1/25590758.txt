Hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron overload disease caused by a deficiency in 
the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin, is associated with lethal infections by 
siderophilic bacteria. To elucidate the mechanisms of this susceptibility, we 
infected wild-type and hepcidin-deficient mice with the siderophilic bacterium 
Vibrio vulnificus and found that hepcidin deficiency results in increased 
bacteremia and decreased survival of infected mice, which can be partially 
ameliorated by dietary iron depletion. Additionally, timely administration of 
hepcidin agonists to hepcidin-deficient mice induces hypoferremia that decreases 
bacterial loads and rescues these mice from death, regardless of initial iron 
levels. Studies of Vibrio vulnificus growth ex vivo show that high iron sera 
from hepcidin-deficient mice support extraordinarily rapid bacterial growth and 
that this is inhibited in hypoferremic sera. Our findings demonstrate that 
hepcidin-mediated hypoferremia is a host defense mechanism against siderophilic 
pathogens and suggest that hepcidin agonists may improve infection outcomes in 
patients with hereditary hemochromatosis or thalassemia.
