Mutations of the Treacle Ribosome Biogenesis Factor 1 (TCOF1) gene can lead to 
Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS). In present study, the peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a 33-year-old male TCS patient with the 
heterozygous TCOF1 mutation c.1966_1969dup (p.Ser657Trpfs*25) were reprogrammed 
into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) named PSHi002-A through episomal 
plasmids encoding hOCT4, hSOX2, hNANOG, hLIN28, hKLF4, and hL-MYC. The 
established iPSC line expressed pluripotent markers, had a normal karyotype (46, 
XY), and can be differentiated into the three germ layers in vivo.
