Serotonin is an endogenous neurotransmitter that regulates aggressive and 
impulsive behavior and may be involved in the development of attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 5-HT1B knockout mice display hyperactivity, 
increased exploratory activity and aggression, reduced anxiety, increased 
vulnerability to cocaine self-administration, and elevated alcohol consumption. 
Many of these same behaviors are seen in patients with ADHD. Prior studies 
reported excess transmission of the 861G allele of 5-HT1B to ADHD offspring. We 
used the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype analysis to 
investigate the A-161T and G861C polymorphisms in the 5-HT1B receptor gene in 
ADHD trios from the Chinese Han population. We found no association with ADHD 
but did find a tendency for excess transmission of the 861G allele (chi(2) = 
3.766, P = 0.052) and the G/A haplotype (chi(2) = 2.925, df = 1, P = 0.087), and 
under-transmission of C/A haplotype (chi(2) = 3.707, df = 1, P = 0.054) to 
offspring with inattentive ADHD.
