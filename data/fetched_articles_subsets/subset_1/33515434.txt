Mutations of the genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are highly associated 
with various central nervous system disorders. Recurrent mutations, including 
c.5A>G, p.D2G; c.1367C>T, p.S456L; c.1535G>A, p.R512Q and c.1846_1847del, p. 
Y616Lfs*6 of RARS1 gene, which encodes two forms of human cytoplasmic 
arginyl-tRNA synthetase (hArgRS), are linked to Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like 
disease (PMLD) with unclear pathogenesis. Among these mutations, c.5A>G is the 
most extensively reported mutation, leading to a p.D2G mutation in the 
N-terminal extension of the long-form hArgRS. Here, we showed the detrimental 
effects of R512Q substitution and ΔC mutations on the structure and function of 
hArgRS, while the most frequent mutation c.5A>G, p.D2G acted in a different 
manner without impairing hArgRS activity. The nucleotide substitution c.5A>G 
reduced translation of hArgRS mRNA, and an upstream open reading frame 
contributed to the suppressed translation of the downstream main ORF. Taken 
together, our results elucidated distinct pathogenic mechanisms of various RARS1 
mutations in PMLD.
