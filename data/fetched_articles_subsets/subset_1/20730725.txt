BACKGROUND: The Trp64Arg polymorphism in the beta₃-adrenergic receptor 
(beta₃-AR) gene was extensively studied concerning the relationship with 
cardiovascular (CV) diseases, but few studies addressed this issue in athletes.
AIM: To examine the relationship between the Trp64Arg polymorphism in the 
beta₃-AR gene and several CV functions such as cardiac structure and function or 
blood biochemical parameters in Korean male controls and athletes.
METHODS: We recruited a total of 114 study subjects, including 81 male athletes 
(8 long distance runners, 17 soccer, 8 baseball, 10 basketball, 8 volleyball, 8 
ice hockey, 8 judo, 6 taekwondo and 8 gymnastics) and 33 controls. Two 
dimensional echocardiography was performed in order to assess the cardiac 
structure and function and blood biochemical parameters were measured. 
Genotyping of Trp64Arg polymorphism in the beta₃-AR gene was also performed by 
the SNaPshot method.
RESULTS: The genotype and allele distribution of Trp64Arg polymorphism in the 
beta₃-AR gene were significantly different among each sporting discipline, 
showing the highest Arg allele frequency in volleyball and gymnastics (p < 
0.05). Also, this polymorphism was significantly associated with serum 
HDL-cholesterol and glucose level in athletes only (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed the significant associations between the Trp64Arg 
polymorphism in the beta₃-AR gene and some CV parameters such as serum 
HDL-cholesterol and glucose levels in athletes. However, further studies of the 
precise mechanism behind these associations are needed.
