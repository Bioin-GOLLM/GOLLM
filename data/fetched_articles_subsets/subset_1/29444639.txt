BACKGROUND: The identification of genes differentially expressed in the skeletal 
muscle of pigs displaying distinct growth and fatness profiles might contribute 
to identify the genetic factors that influence the phenotypic variation of such 
traits. So far, the majority of porcine transcriptomic studies have investigated 
differences in gene expression at a global scale rather than at the mRNA isoform 
level. In the current work, we have investigated the differential expression of 
mRNA isoforms in the gluteus medius (GM) muscle of 52 Duroc HIGH (increased 
backfat thickness, intramuscular fat and saturated and monounsaturated fatty 
acids contents) and LOW pigs (opposite phenotype, with an increased 
polyunsaturated fatty acids content).
RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that 10.9% of genes expressed in the GM muscle 
generate alternative mRNA isoforms, with an average of 2.9 transcripts per gene. 
By using two different pipelines, one based on the CLC Genomics Workbench and 
another one on the STAR, RSEM and DESeq2 softwares, we have identified 10 mRNA 
isoforms that both pipelines categorize as differentially expressed in HIGH vs 
LOW pigs (P-value < 0.01 and ±0.6 log2fold-change). Only five mRNA isoforms, 
produced by the ITGA5, SEMA4D, LITAF, TIMP1 and ANXA2 genes, remain significant 
after correction for multiple testing (q-value < 0.05 and ±0.6 log2fold-change), 
being upregulated in HIGH pigs.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased levels of specific ITGA5, LITAF, TIMP1 and ANXA2 mRNA 
isoforms in HIGH pigs is consistent with reports indicating that the 
overexpression of these four genes is associated with obesity and metabolic 
disorders in humans. A broader knowledge about the functional attributes of 
these mRNA variants would be fundamental to elucidate the consequences of 
transcript diversity on the determinism of porcine phenotypes of economic 
interest.
