Inherited renal tubular disorders associated with hypokalemic alkalosis 
(Bartter-like syndromes) can be subdivided into at least three clinical 
phenotypes: (i) the hypocalciuric-hypomagnesemic Gitelman variant; (ii) the 
classic variant; and (iii) the antenatal hypercalciuric variant (also termed 
hyperprostaglandin E syndrome). Mutations in the Na-Cl cotransporter (NCCT) 
underlie the pathogenesis of the Gitelman variant and mutations in the Na-K-2Cl 
cotransporter (NKCC2) have recently been identified in the antenatal 
hypercalciuric variant. We now describe mutations in the gene encoding the 
inwardly-rectifying potassium channel, ROMK, in eight kindreds with the 
antenatal variant of Bartter syndrome. These findings indicate that antenatal 
Bartter syndrome is genetically heterogeneous and provide new insights into the 
molecular pathogenesis of Bartter-like syndromes.
