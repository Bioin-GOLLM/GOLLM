BACKGROUND: The human tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic 
milieu of diverse acellular and cellular components, creating an 
immunosuppressive environment, which contributes to tumor progression. We have 
previously shown that phosphatidylserine (PS) expressed on the surface of 
exosomes isolated from human TMEs is causally linked to T-cell 
immunosuppression, representing a potential immunotherapeutic target. In this 
study, we investigated the effect of ExoBlock, a novel PS-binding molecule, on 
T-cell responses in the TME.
METHODS: We designed and synthesized a new compound, (ZnDPA)6-DP-15K, a 
multivalent PS binder named ExoBlock. The PS-binding avidity of ExoBlock was 
tested using an in vitro competition assay. The ability of this molecule to 
reverse exosome-mediated immunosuppression in vitro was tested using human 
T-cell activation assays. The in vivo therapeutic efficacy of ExoBlock was then 
tested in two different human tumor xenograft models, the melanoma-based 
xenomimetic (X-)mouse model, and the ovarian tumor-based omental tumor xenograft 
(OTX) model.
RESULTS: ExoBlock was able to bind PS with high avidity and was found to 
consistently and significantly block the immunosuppressive activity of human 
ovarian tumor and melanoma-associated exosomes in vitro. ExoBlock was also able 
to significantly enhance T cell-mediated tumor suppression in vivo in both the 
X-mouse and the OTX model. In the X-mouse model, ExoBlock suppressed tumor 
recurrence in a T cell-dependent manner. In the OTX model, ExoBlock treatment 
resulted in an increase in the number as well as function of CD4 and CD8 T cells 
in the TME, which was associated with a reduction in tumor burden and 
metastasis, as well as in the number of circulating PS+ exosomes in 
tumor-bearing mice.
CONCLUSION: Our results establish that targeting exosomal PS in TMEs with 
ExoBlock represents a promising strategy to enhance antitumor T-cell responses.
