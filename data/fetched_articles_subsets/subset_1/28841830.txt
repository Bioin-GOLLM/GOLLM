BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested a link between alcohol intake and adiposity. 
However, results from longitudinal studies have been inconsistent, and a 
possible interaction with genetic predisposition to adiposity measures has often 
not been taken into account.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between alcohol intake recorded at 
baseline and subsequent annual changes in body weight (∆BW), waist circumference 
(ΔWC) and WC adjusted for BMI (ΔWCBMI), and to test for interaction with genetic 
predisposition scores based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated 
with various forms of adiposity.
METHOD: This study included a total of 7028 adult men and women from MONICA, the 
Diet, Cancer and Health cohort (DCH), and the Inter99 studies. We combined 50 
adiposity-associated SNPs into four scores indicating genetic predisposition to 
BMI, WC, WHRBMI and all three traits combined. Linear regression was used to 
examine the association of alcohol intake (drinks of 12 g (g) alcohol/day) with 
ΔBW, ΔWC, and ΔWCBMI, and to examine possible interactions with SNP-scores. 
Results from the analyses of the individual cohorts were combined in 
meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Each additional drink/day was associated with a ΔBW/year of -18.0 g 
(95% confidence interval (CI): -33.4, -2.6, P = 0.02) and a ΔWC of -0.3 mm/year 
(-0.5, -0.0, P = 0.03). In analyses of women only, alcohol intake was associated 
with a higher ΔWCBMI of 0.5 mm/year (0.2, 0.9, P = 0.002) per drink/day. 
Overall, we found no statistically significant interactions between the four 
SNP-scores and alcohol intake in relation to changes in adiposity measures. 
However in analyses of women separately, we found interaction between the 
complete score of all 50 SNPs and alcohol intake in relation to ΔBW (P for 
interaction = 0.03). No significant interaction was observed among the men.
CONCLUSION: Alcohol intake was associated with a decrease in BW and WC among men 
and women, and an increase in WCBMI among women only. We found no strong 
indication that these associations depend on a genetic predisposition to 
adiposity.
