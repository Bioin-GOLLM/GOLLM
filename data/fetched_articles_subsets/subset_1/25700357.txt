Colorectal cancer remains one of the most common cancers in men and women, and 
it accounts for a large proportion of cancer-related deaths worldwide. 
Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are a novel class of "single protein RING 
finger" E3 ubiquitin ligases, which have been shown to be involved in many 
cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of TRIM24 
in human colorectal cancer. By using a lentivirus-mediated RNA interference 
system, we first explored the effect of TRIM24 knockdown on HCT116 cell 
proliferation and colony formation. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis was used 
to examine its effects on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Our data showed 
that knockdown of TRIM24 expression in HCT116 cells significantly decreased cell 
growth due to the induction of apoptosis. Hence, the present study provides 
evidence that TRIM24 functions as an oncogene in colorectal carcinogenesis.
