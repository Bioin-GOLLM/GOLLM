People with chronic stress have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
which enhance their susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. Diacerein has 
ability to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6; however, 
its efficacy in chronic stress associated cardiovascular diseases is not yet 
assessed. In this study, we standardized a rat model of chronic unpredictable 
stress (CUS) demonstrating cardiovascular dysfunctions and further assessed the 
effect of IL-6 modulator, diacerein, on cardiovascular functions in CUS exposed 
rats. The CUS procedure consisted of exposing male albino Wistar rats to random 
stressors, everyday for 8 weeks. The binding affinity of diacerein with IL-6 was 
ascertained using Docking tools viz AutoDock and SwissDock. Moreover, diacerein 
was administered (50 mg/kg/day x 20 days P.O) post CUS exposure to rats and the 
serum IL-6 levels and heart functions of CUS rats were determined by ELISA and 
ECG-HRV analysis, respectively. 8 weeks of CUS exposure resulted in two-fold 
increase in serum corticosterone and IL-6 levels in rats. The ECG and HRV 
analysis of CUS rats showed altered sinus rhythm, elevated heart rate, systolic 
blood pressure and sympathetic tone. Molecular docking studies revealed 
diacerein high binding affinity towards IL-6 receptor. The post-treatment of 
diacerein in CUS rats prevented these cardiovascular dysfunctions. Our findings 
thus suggests that IL-6 may have a prominent role in chronic stress induced 
cardiovascular dysfunctions and diacerein, could be used as a preventive measure 
for such conditions.
