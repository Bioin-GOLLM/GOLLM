INTRODUCTION: New fluorinated diaryl ethers and bisarylic ketones were designed 
and evaluated for their anti-inflammatory effects in primary macrophages.
METHODS: The synthesis of the designed molecules started from easily accessible 
and versatile gem-difluoro propargylic derivatives. The desired aromatic systems 
were obtained using Diels-Alder/aromatization sequences and this was followed by 
Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions and, when required, final functionalization 
steps. Both direct inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase-1 or -2 activities, 
protein expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and nitric oxide synthase-II and the 
production of prostaglandin E2, the pro-inflammatory nitric oxide and 
interleukin-6 were evaluated in primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages 
in response to lipopolysaccharide. Docking of the designed molecules in 
cyclooxygenase-1 or -2 was performed.
RESULTS: Only fluorinated compounds exerted anti-inflammatory activities by 
lowering the secretion of interleukin-6, nitric oxide, and prostaglandin E2, and 
decreasing the protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and 
cyclooxygenase-2 in mouse primary macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide, as 
well as cyclooxygenase activity for some inhibitors with different efficiencies 
depending on the R-groups. Docking observation suggested an inhibitory role of 
cyclooxygenase-1 or -2 for compounds A3, A4 and A5 in addition to their capacity 
to inhibit nitrite, interleukin-6, and nitric oxide synthase-II and 
cyclooxygenase-2 expression.
CONCLUSION: The new fluorinated diaryl ethers and bisarylic ketones have 
anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages. These fluorinated compounds have 
improved potential anti-inflammatory properties due to the fluorine residues in 
the bioactive molecules.
