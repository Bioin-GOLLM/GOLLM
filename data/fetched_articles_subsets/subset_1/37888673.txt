Air pollution is an important public health problem that endangers human health. 
However, the casual association and pathogenesis between particles < 2.5 Î¼m 
(PM2.5) and hyperlipidemia remains incompletely unknown. Mendelian randomization 
(MR) and transcriptomic data analysis were performed, and an air pollution model 
using mice was constructed to investigate the association between PM2.5 and 
hyperlipidemia. MR analysis demonstrated that PM2.5 is associated with 
hyperlipidemia and the triglyceride (TG) level in the European population (IVW 
method of hyperlipidemia: OR: 1.0063, 95%CI: 1.0010-1.0118, p = 0.0210; IVW 
method of TG level: OR: 1.1004, 95%CI: 1.0067-1.2028, p = 0.0350). Mest, Adipoq, 
Ccl2, and Pcsk9 emerged in the differentially expressed genes of the liver and 
plasma of PM2.5 model mice, which might mediate atherosclerosis accelerated by 
PM2.5. The studied animal model shows that the Paigen Diet (PD)-fed male LDLR-/- 
mice had higher total cholesterol (TC), TG, and CM/VLDL cholesterol levels than 
the control group did after 10 times 5 mg/kg PM2.5 intranasal instillation once 
every three days. Our study revealed that PM2.5 had causality with 
hyperlipidemia, and PM2.5 might affect liver secretion, which could further 
regulate atherosclerosis. The lipid profile of PD-fed Familial 
Hypercholesterolemia (FH) model mice is more likely to be jeopardized by PM2.5 
exposure.
