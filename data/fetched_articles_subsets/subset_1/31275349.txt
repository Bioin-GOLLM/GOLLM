Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) is a 
carbohydrate-signaling transcription factor that in the past years has emerged 
as a central metabolic regulator. ChREBP expression is mostly abundant in active 
sites of de novo lipogenesis including liver and white and brown adipose 
tissues. ChREBP is also expressed in pancreatic islets, small intestine and to a 
lesser extent in the kidney and the brain. In response to glucose, ChREBP 
undergoes several post-translational modifications (PTMs) (phosphorylation, 
acetylation and/or O-GlcNAcylation) that will either modulate its cellular 
location, stability and/or its transcriptional activity. ChREBPβ is a shorter 
isoform of ChREBP that was first described in adipose tissue and later found to 
be expressed in other sites including liver and pancreatic β cells. ChREBPβ 
lacks an important regulatory inhibitory domain, known as LID (low glucose 
inhibitory domain), in its N-terminal domain and is therefore reported as a 
highly active isoform. In this review, we recapitulate a recent progress 
concerning the mechanisms governing the activity of the ChREBP isoforms, 
including PTMs, partners/cofactors as well as novel metabolic pathways regulated 
by ChREBP in key metabolic tissues, by discussing phenotypes associated with 
tissue-specific deletion of ChREBP in knockout mice.
