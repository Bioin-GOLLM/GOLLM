During oxidative stress, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains modify a variety of 
proteins including ribosomes. Knowledge of the precise sites of K63 ubiquitin is 
key to understand its function during the response to stress. To identify the 
sites of K63 ubiquitin, we developed a new mass spectrometry based method that 
quantified >1100 K63 ubiquitination sites in yeast that responded to oxidative 
stress induced by H2O2. We determined that under stress, K63 ubiquitin-modified 
proteins were involved in several cellular functions including ion transport, 
protein trafficking, and translation. The most abundant ubiquitin sites 
localized to the head of the 40S subunit of the ribosome, modified assembled 
polysomes, and affected the binding of translation factors. The results 
suggested a new pathway of post-initiation control of translation during 
oxidative stress and illustrated the importance of high-resolution mapping of 
noncanonical ubiquitination events.
