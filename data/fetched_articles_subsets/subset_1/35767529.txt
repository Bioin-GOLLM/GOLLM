As is the case globally, Cryptococcus gattii is a less frequent cause of 
cryptococcosis than Cryptococcus neoformans in South Africa. We performed 
multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and fluconazole susceptibility testing of 146 
isolates randomly selected from 750 South African patients with C. gattii 
disease identified through enhanced laboratory surveillance, 2005 to 2013. The 
dominant molecular type was VGIV (101/146, 70%), followed by VGI (40/146, 27%), 
VGII (3/146, 2%) and VGIII (2/146, 1%). Among the 146 C. gattii isolates, 99 
different sequence types (STs) were identified, with ST294 (14/146, 10%) and 
ST155 (10/146, 7%) being most commonly observed. The fluconazole MIC50 and MIC90 
values of 105 (of 146) randomly selected C. gattii isolates were 4 μg/ml and 16 
μg/ml, respectively. VGIV isolates had a lower MIC50 value compared to non-VGIV 
isolates, but these values were within one double-dilution of each other. 
HIV-seropositive patients had a ten-fold increased adjusted odds of a VGIV 
infection compared to HIV-seronegative patients, though with small numbers 
(99/136; 73% vs. 2/10; 20%), the confidence interval (CI) was wide (95% CI: 
1.93-55.31, p = 0.006). Whole genome phylogeny of 98 isolates of South Africa's 
most prevalent molecular type, VGIV, identified that this molecular type is 
highly diverse, with two interesting clusters of ten and six closely related 
isolates being identified, respectively. One of these clusters consisted only of 
patients from the Mpumalanga Province in South Africa, suggesting a similar 
environmental source. This study contributed new insights into the global 
population structure of this important human pathogen.
