The immune response to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine in newborns of 
hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive or HBeAg-negative mothers is the subject 
of Huang et al. The authors report no correlation between the HBeAg status of 
the mothers/cord blood and the newborns immune response to the vaccine, but, 
unfortunately, draw unfounded conclusions regarding the tolerogenic potential of 
in utero exposure to HBeAg. In this reply, I address the possible influence of 
in utero exposure to the HBeAg, and briefly review other characteristics of the 
HBeAg, that may promote HBV chronicity. I argue that the function of HBeAg 
should no longer be considered "unknown" and that 
immunotolerance/immunomodulation represent the dominant functions of the HBeAg 
in viral-host interactions.
