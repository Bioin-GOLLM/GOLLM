Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common sarcoma, often 
resulting from a KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) 
mutation. The lineage transcription factor ETV1 is expressed similarly in GISTs 
regardless of malignant potential. Although the related transcription factor 
ETV4 has been associated with metastasis and tumor progression in other cancers, 
its role in GIST is unknown. In this study, we found that ETV4 levels were high 
in a subset of human GISTs and correlated with high mitotic rate. Through Gene 
Set Enrichment Analysis in selected human GISTs, we identified a relationship 
between ETV4 levels and β-catenin signaling, especially in advanced GISTs. GIST 
specimens with high ETV4 levels overexpressed cell cycle regulating genes and 
had aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt pathway. In human GIST cell lines, 
ETV4 RNA interference suppressed cell cycle genes and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. 
ETV4 knockdown also reduced tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and tumor growth 
in vivo. Conversely, ETV4 overexpression increased cyclin D1 expression and 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, we determined that ETV4 knockdown 
destabilized nuclear β-catenin and increased its degradation via COP1, an E3 
ligase involved in both ETV4 and β-catenin turnover. Aberrant accumulation of 
ETV4 and nuclear β-catenin was found in patient derived xenografts created from 
metastatic GISTs that became resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
Collectively, our findings highlight the significance of ETV4 expression in GIST 
and identify ETV4 as a biomarker in human GISTs.
