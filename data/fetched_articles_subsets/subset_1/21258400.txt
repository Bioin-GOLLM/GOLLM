The protein kinase encoded by the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) 
gene is activated by DNA-damaging agents that are frequently used as anticancer 
therapeutics. Inhibition of ATR expression in cultured cancer cells has been 
demonstrated to increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, including the 
DNA-crosslinking agent cisplatin. Cisplatin is a widely used and effective drug, 
but its use is associated with significant toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that 
genetic inhibition of ATR expression selectively enhanced cisplatin sensitivity 
in human colorectal cancer cells with inactivated p53. A knock-in strategy was 
used to restore wild-type p53 in cells harboring wild-type or mutant ATR 
alleles. Knock-in of functional p53 in ATR-deficient cells restored checkpoint 
function, suppressed apoptotic pathways and markedly increased clonogenic 
survival after cisplatin treatment. These results suggest that a strategy that 
combines specific inhibitors of ATR and conventional therapies might promote 
synthetic lethality in p53-deficient tumors, and thus minimize toxicity to 
normal tissues.
