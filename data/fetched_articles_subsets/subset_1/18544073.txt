BACKGROUND: Host genetic susceptibility has been suggested as one of the most 
important possible explanations for interindividual difference in gastric cancer 
(GC) risk.
AIM: To evaluate the impact of tumour invasion-related gene polymorphisms, which 
may be involved in a variety of processes during GC development, such as cell 
adhesion and angiogenesis, on the risk of GC.
METHODS: We reviewed published studies on tumour invasion-related gene 
polymorphisms and GC susceptibility until 31 March 2008, and then quantitatively 
summarized associations of the most widely-studied polymorphism, CDH1 -160C>A, 
with GC using meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven eligible studies were included in this review. Fourteen 
polymorphisms significantly related to GC in at least one study were identified. 
For several polymorphisms, heterogeneous results were observed and associations 
in opposite directions were seen among Asian and Caucasian populations. In 
meta-analysis, CDH1 -160C>A showed an inverse association with GC among Asians 
(OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.55-1.05) and a positive association among Caucasians (OR, 
1.40; 95% CI, 0.95-2.04).
CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that genetic polymorphisms in tumour invasion 
could be candidate biomarkers of GC risk. However, differences between 
populations and stages of cancer need to be taken into account and may explain 
some of the inconsistencies found in previous studies.
