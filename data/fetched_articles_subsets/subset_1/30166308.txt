OBJECTIVES: Lynch syndrome (LS), a genetically inherited autosomal disorder, 
increases the incidence of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). We aimed to perform a 
universal strategy to assess the prevalence and clinicopathological 
characteristics of early onset CRCs at high risk of LS versus late-onset ones in 
the Iranian population.
SETTING: A local population-based study from Northeastern Iran.
PARTICIPANTS: 321 consecutive CRCs and pathology specimen screened between 2013 
and 2016.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Retrospectively, information regarding 
the clinical criteria was obtained by interviewing the patients with CRC or, 
their families. Pathologists tested tumours with immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
staining of four mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2). 
Tumours with absent IHC staining of MLH1 were tested for BRAF mutations to 
exclude sporadic CRCs. Prevalence of early onset CRCs at high risk of LS and 
familial CRC type X were assessed as primary and secondary outcome measures, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Of 321 CRCs (13/123 (10.57%), early onset vs 21/198 (10.6%) late-onset) 
were detected to be MMR-deficient (dMMR). Nine early onset cases and 14 
late-onset ones with a loss of MLH1 underwent testing for the BRAF mutation, 
none of the early onset and four (2.02%) late-onset were recognised as sporadic. 
The difference in the outcome of IHC-analysis between early and late-onset CRCs 
at high risk of LS was not statistically significant (p=0.34). Majority of the 
suspected LS tumours from early onset patients had arisen in distal part (8/11 
(72.72%) vs 8/14 (57.14%)), all of which were occurred in the rectum or sigmoid.
CONCLUSION: Clinically, these findings suggest that in case of limitation for 
BRAF testing, the practitioner in Iran may consider managing early onset dMMR 
cases like LS until access to BRAF testing becomes available to them, before 
germline testing to accurately diagnose LS.
