The enteroviral 2C protein is a therapeutic target, but the absence of a 
mechanistic framework for this enzyme limits our understanding of inhibitor 
mechanisms. Here, we use poliovirus 2C and a derivative thereof to elucidate the 
first biochemical mechanism for this enzyme and confirm the applicability of 
this mechanism to other members of the enterovirus genus. Our biochemical data 
are consistent with a dimer forming in solution, binding to RNA, which 
stimulates ATPase activity by increasing the rate of hydrolysis without 
impacting affinity for ATP substantially. Both RNA and DNA bind to the same or 
overlapping site on 2C, driven by the phosphodiester backbone, but only RNA 
stimulates ATP hydrolysis. We propose that RNA binds to 2C driven by the 
backbone, with reorientation of the ribose hydroxyls occurring in a second step 
to form the catalytically competent state. 2C also uses a two-step mechanism for 
binding to ATP. Initial binding is driven by the α and β phosphates of ATP. In 
the second step, the adenine base and other substituents of ATP are used to 
organize the active site for catalysis. These studies provide the first 
biochemical description of determinants driving specificity and catalytic 
efficiency of a picornaviral 2C ATPase.
