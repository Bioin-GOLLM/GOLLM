In January 2015, during a 3-week period, 12 captive Tonkean macacques at a 
sanctuary in Italy died. An orthopoxvirus infection was suspected because of 
negative-staining electron microscopy results. The diagnosis was confirmed by 
histology, virus isolation, and molecular analysis performed on different organs 
from all animals. An epidemiologic investigation was unable to define the 
infection source in the surrounding area. Trapped rodents were negative by 
virologic testing, but specific IgG was detected in 27.27% of small rodents and 
14.28% of rats. An attenuated live vaccine was administered to the susceptible 
monkey population, and no adverse reactions were observed; a detectable humoral 
immune response was induced in most of the vaccinated animals. We performed 
molecular characterization of the orthopoxvirus isolate by next-generation 
sequencing. According to the phylogenetic analysis of the 9 conserved genes, the 
virus could be part of a novel clade, lying between cowpox and ectromelia 
viruses.
