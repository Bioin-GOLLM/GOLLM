Available anti-obesity pharmacotherapy options remain very limited and 
development of more effective drugs has become a priority. The potential 
strategies to achieve weight loss are to reduce energy intake by stimulating 
anorexigenic signals or by blocking orexigenic signals, and to increase energy 
expenditure. This review will focus on approved obesity medications, as well as 
potential new pharmacologic treatment options.
