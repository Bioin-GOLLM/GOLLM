Primary deficiency of complement C3 is rare and usually associated with 
increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. In this work, we investigated 
the molecular basis of complete C3 deficiency in a Brazilian 9-year old female 
patient with a family history of consanguinity. Hemolytic assays revealed 
complete lack of complement-mediated hemolytic activity in the patient's serum. 
While levels of the complement regulatory proteins Factor I, Factor H and Factor 
B were normal in the patient's and family members' sera, complement C3 levels 
were undetectable in the patient's serum and were reduced by at least 50% in the 
sera of the patient's parents and brother. Additionally, no C3 could be observed 
in the patient's plasma and cell culture supernatants by Western blot. We also 
observed that patient's skin fibroblasts stimulated with Escherichia coli LPS 
were unable to secrete C3, which might be accumulated within the cells before 
being intracellularly degraded. Sequencing analysis of the patient's C3 cDNA 
revealed a genetic mutation responsible for the complete skipping of exon 27, 
resulting in the loss of 99 nucleotides (3450-3549) located in the TED domain. 
Sequencing of the intronic region between the exons 26 and 27 of the C3 gene 
(nucleotides 6690313-6690961) showed a nucleotide exchange (T→C) at position 
6690626 located in a splicing donor site, resulting in the complete skipping of 
exon 27 in the C3 mRNA.
