An A1-adenosine receptor has been cloned from a rat brain cDNA library using a 
probe generated by the polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA encodes a protein of 
327 amino acids which is 91% identical to a recently cloned dog A1-adenosine 
receptor (RDC7). Expression of the rat cDNA in COS-6M and NIH 3T3 cells resulted 
in ligand binding and functional activity characteristics of an A1-adenosine 
receptor that is coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Examination of the 
distribution of A1-adenosine receptor mRNA by Northern blot analysis showed that 
it is highly expressed in brain, spinal cord, testis, and white adipose tissue. 
In situ hybridization studies revealed an extensive hybridization pattern in the 
central nervous system, with high levels in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, 
cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord. The cloned A1-adenosine 
receptor may thus mediate many of the modulatory actions of adenosine in neural 
and endocrine systems.
