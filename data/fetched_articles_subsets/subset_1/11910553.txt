A Dutch family with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) displayed a 
phenotype characterized by an early age of onset, a diffuse loss of rod and cone 
sensitivity, and constricted visual fields (type I). One male showed a mild 
progression of the disease. Linkage analysis showed cosegregation of the genetic 
defect with markers from chromosome 17p13.1-p13.3, a region overlapping the RP13 
locus. The critical interval of the RP locus as defined in this family was 
flanked by D17S926 and D17S786, with a maximal lod score of 4.2 (theta = 0.00) 
for marker D17S1529. Soon after the mapping of the underlying defect to the 
17p13 region, a missense mutation (6970G>A; R2310K) was identified in exon 42 of 
the splicing factor gene PRPC8 in one patient of this family. Diagnostic 
restriction enzyme digestion of exon 42 amplified from genomic DNA of all family 
members revealed that the R2310K mutation segregated fully with the disease. The 
type I phenotype observed in this family is similar to that described for three 
other RP13 families with mutations in PRPC8.
