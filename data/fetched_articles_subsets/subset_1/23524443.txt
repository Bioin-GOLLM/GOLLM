Somatic loss of heterozygosity, but not haploinsufficiency alone, leads to

with FAS start codon mutation.

We describe a family with 12 members carrying a heterozygous germline FAS c.3G>T 
start codon mutation leading to FAS haploinsufficiency. One patient had 
autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), one had recovered from ALPS, and 
ten mutation-positive relatives (MPRs) were healthy. FAS-mediated apoptosis and 
surface expression of FAS in single-positive T cells were lower for MPRs but did 
not discriminate between them and the ALPS patient. However, double-negative 
(DN) T cells of the ALPS patient had no FAS expression due to somatic loss of 
heterozygosity. Our results in this kindred suggest that FAS haploinsufficiency 
does not cause ALPS-FAS, but that modifying genetic events are crucial for its 
pathogenesis. FAS surface expression on DN T cells should be assessed routinely 
and FAS haploinsufficient patients should be followed as its potential for 
lymphomagenesis is not well defined and a second hit might occur later on.
