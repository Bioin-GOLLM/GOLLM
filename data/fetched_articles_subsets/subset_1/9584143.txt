Infection of C57BL/6 mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) 
stimulates major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted cytotoxic T cells 
(CTLs), which normally resolve the infection. Three peptide epitopes derived 
from LCMV have been shown to bind the mouse class I molecule H-2 Db and to 
stimulate CTL responses in LCMV-infected mice. This report describes the 
identity and abundance of each CTL epitope after their elution from 
LCMV-infected cells. Based on this information, peptide abundance was found to 
correlate with the magnitude of each CTL response generated after infection with 
LCMV. Subsequent experiments, performed to determine the antiviral capacity of 
each CTL specificity, indicate that the quantitative hierarchy of CTL activity 
does not correlate with the ability to protect against LCMV infection. This 
report, therefore, indicates that immunodominant epitopes should be defined, not 
only by the strength of the CTL response that they stimulate, but also by the 
ability of the CTLs to protect against infection.
