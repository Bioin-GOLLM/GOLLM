The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-binding integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8 are clinically validated 
cancer and fibrosis targets of considerable therapeutic importance. Compounds 
that can discriminate between the two closely related integrin proteins and 
other RGD integrins, stabilize specific conformational states, and have 
sufficient stability enabling tissue restricted administration could have 
considerable therapeutic utility. Existing small molecules and antibody 
inhibitors do not have all of these properties, and hence there is a need for 
new approaches. Here we describe a method for computationally designing 
hyperstable RGD-containing miniproteins that are highly selective for a single 
RGD integrin heterodimer and conformational state, and use this strategy to 
design inhibitors of αvβ6 and αvβ8 with high selectivity. The αvβ6 and αvβ8 
inhibitors have picomolar affinities for their targets, and >1000-fold 
selectivity over other RGD integrins. CryoEM structures are within 0.6-0.7Å 
root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) to the computational design models; the 
designed αvβ6 inhibitor and native ligand stabilize the open conformation in 
contrast to the therapeutic anti-αvβ6 antibody BG00011 that stabilizes the 
bent-closed conformation and caused on-target toxicity in patients with lung 
fibrosis, and the αvβ8 inhibitor maintains the constitutively fixed 
extended-closed αvβ8 conformation. In a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung 
fibrosis, the αvβ6 inhibitor potently reduced fibrotic burden and improved 
overall lung mechanics when delivered via oropharyngeal administration mimicking 
inhalation, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of de novo designed integrin 
binding proteins with high selectivity.
