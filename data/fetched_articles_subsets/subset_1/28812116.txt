PURPOSE: This nested case-control study aimed to evaluate the association of 
candidate genetic variants with statin-induced myotoxicity in Chinese patients 
with coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: One hundred forty-eight Chinese patients experiencing statin-induced 
myotoxicity were included in our study, and 255 patients without muscular side 
effects served as controls. Five SNPs in CYP3A5, SLCO1B1, and APOE were 
genotyped. The effect of genetic variants on statin-induced myotoxicity was 
assessed.
RESULTS: Patients who carried at least one SLCO1B1 521C allele had a higher risk 
for myotoxicity (OR = 1.69, 95%CI = 1.07-2.67, P = 0.024). Significant 
association was found between SLCO1B1 521C mutant allele mutation and risk of 
myotoxicity in individuals that received rosuvastatin (OR = 3.67, 
95%CI = 1.42-9.47, P = 0.007). However, non-significant association was observed 
between 521C mutant allele and risk of myotoxicity (P > 0.5) in patients that 
received atorvastatin and simvastatin. The other four single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), namely rs776746, rs2306283, rs7412, and rs429358, showed 
no significant association with any statin induced myotoxicity (P > 0.5).
CONCLUSIONS: SLCO1B1 (rs4149056, 521T > C) is associated with statin-induced 
myotoxicity in Chinese patients with coronary artery disease. In addition, 
SLCO1B1 521C mutant allele increased the risk of rosuvastatin-associated 
myotoxicity.
