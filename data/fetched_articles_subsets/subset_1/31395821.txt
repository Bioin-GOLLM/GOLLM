Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) plays a specific role as a negative 
regulator of insulin signaling pathways and is a validated therapeutic target 
for Type 2 diabetes. Previously, arylbenzofurans were reported to have 
inhibitory activity against PTP1B. However, detailed investigation regarding 
their structure activity relationship (SAR) has not been elucidated. The main 
aim of this work was to investigate the PTP1B inhibitory activity of 
2-arylbenzofuran analogs (sanggenofuran A (SA), mulberrofuran D2 (MD2), 
mulberrofuran D (MD), morusalfuran B (MB), mulberrofuran H (MH)) isolated from 
the root bark of Morus alba. All compounds demonstrated potent inhibitory 
activity with IC50 values ranging from 3.11 to 53.47 µM. Among the tested 
compounds, MD2 showed the strongest activity (IC50, 3.11 µM), followed by MD and 
MB, while SA and MH demonstrated the lowest activity. Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon 
plots were used for the determination of inhibition type whereas ligand and 
receptor interactions were investigated in modeled complexes via molecular 
docking. Our study clearly supports 2-arylbenzofuran analogs as a promising 
class of PTP1B inhibitors and illustrates the key positions responsible for the 
inhibitory activity, their correlation, the effect of prenyl/geranyl groups, and 
the influence of resorcinol scaffold, which can be further explored in-depth to 
develop therapeutic agents against T2DM.
