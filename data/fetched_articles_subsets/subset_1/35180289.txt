Chemotactic migration is a fundamental cellular behavior relying on the 
coordinated flux of lipids and cargo proteins toward the leading edge. We found 
here that the core autophagy protein ATG9A plays a critical role in the 
chemotactic migration of several human cell lines, including highly invasive 
glioma cells. Depletion of ATG9A protein altered the formation of large and 
persistent filamentous actin (F-actin)-rich lamellipodia that normally drive 
directional migration. Using live-cell TIRF microscopy, we demonstrated that 
ATG9A-positive vesicles are targeted toward the migration front of polarized 
cells, where their exocytosis correlates with protrusive activity. Finally, we 
found that ATG9A was critical for efficient delivery of β1 integrin to the 
leading edge and normal adhesion dynamics. Collectively, our data uncover a new 
function for ATG9A protein and indicate that ATG9A-positive vesicles are 
mobilized during chemotactic stimulation to facilitate expansion of the 
lamellipodium and its anchorage to the extracellular matrix.
