Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) include a number of different types of tumors 
developing in the skin, in hollow organs, as well as the upper aerodigestive 
tract (UADT) including the head and neck region and the esophagus which will be 
dealt with in this review. These tumors are often refractory to current 
therapeutic approaches with poor patient outcome. The most important prognostic 
determinant of SCC tumors is the presence of distant metastasis, significantly 
correlating with low patient survival rates. Rapidly emerging evidence indicate 
that the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and remodeling profoundly affect 
SSC metastatic dissemination. In this review, we will summarize the current 
knowledge on the role of ECM and its remodeling enzymes in affecting the growth 
and dissemination of UADT SCC. Taken together, these published evidence suggest 
that a thorough analysis of the ECM composition in the UADT SCC microenvironment 
may help disclosing the mechanism of resistance to the treatments and help 
defining possible targets for clinical intervention.
