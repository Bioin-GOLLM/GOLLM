PURPOSE: To describe the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of two 
families with cone dystrophy with supernormal rod responses (CDSRR) presenting 
with a pseudodominant inheritance of disease.
OBSERVATIONS: Three affected members from each family were ascertained. Family 1 
of Egyptian ancestry showed consanguinity, and Family 2 was of Northern Iraqi 
ancestry. Both families showed pseudodominance in their pedigrees.Individuals 
presented with reduced visual acuity and nyctalopia. Macular disturbances were 
present in all, varying from a decreased foveal reflex to geographic atrophy. 
Electrophysiology showed reduced scotopic b-wave amplitudes and prolonged 
implicit times, and characteristic elevated b-wave amplitudes with high 
intensity flashes in all individuals.Genetic analysis of Family 1 identified a 
complete homozygous deletion of the KCNV2 gene, and in Family 2 a homozygous 
missense variation of c.562T > A: p.(Trp188Arg).
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: To our knowledge this is the first report of 
pseudodominance of CDSRR, with a novel pathogenic KCNV2 variant present in the 
second family. Clinicians evaluating these individuals should consider autosomal 
recessive disease manifesting as pseudodominant inheritance. In such cases, 
electrophysiology remains essential for making a definitive diagnosis.
