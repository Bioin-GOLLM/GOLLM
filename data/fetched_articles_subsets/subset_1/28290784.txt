During investigation of molecular nature of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) 
in Petrozavodsk (Russia) cohort of patients a novel low density lipoprotein 
(LDL) receptor gene mutation was found. This mutation designated c.1327 T>C 
(W443R [W422R]) was predicted to cause substitution of arginine for tryptophan 
residue in the very conservative -propeller domain of the LDL receptor. 
Inheritance of the new mutation was traced in four generations and its 
cosegregation with hypercholesterolemia phenotype was observed. Despite the 
predicted pathogenic effect of the mutation, ischemic heart disease in the 
pedigree was mild or absent. We consider identification of this mutation in the 
pedigree extremely helpful to start preventive medical treatment in affected 
patients.
