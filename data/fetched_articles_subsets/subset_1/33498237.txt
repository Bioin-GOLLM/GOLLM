Most early-stage drug discovery projects focus on equilibrium binding affinity 
to the target alongside selectivity and other pharmaceutical properties. Since 
many approved drugs have nonequilibrium binding characteristics, there has been 
increasing interest in optimizing binding kinetics early in the drug discovery 
process. As focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an important drug target, we examine 
whether steered molecular dynamics (SMD) can be useful for identifying drug 
candidates with the desired drug-binding kinetics. In simulating the 
dissociation of 14 ligands from FAK, we find an empirical power-law relationship 
between the simulated time needed for ligand unbinding and the experimental rate 
constant for dissociation, with a strong correlation depending on the SMD force 
used. To improve predictions, we further develop regression models connecting 
experimental dissociation rate with various structural and energetic quantities 
derived from the simulations. These models can be used to predict dissociation 
rates from FAK for related compounds.
