The epsilon(4) allele of APOE confers a two- to fourfold increased risk for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but LOAD pathology does not all fit 
neatly around APOE. It is conceivable that genetic variation proximate to APOE 
contributes to LOAD risk. Therefore, we investigated the degree of linkage 
disequilibrium (LD) for a comprehensive set of 50 SNPs in and surrounding APOE 
using a substantial Caucasian sample of 1100 chromosomes. SNPs in APOE were 
further molecularly haplotyped to determine their phases. One set of SNPs in 
TOMM40, roughly 15 kb upstream of APOE, showed intriguing LD with the epsilon(4) 
allele and was strongly associated with the risk for developing LOAD. However, 
when all the SNPs were entered into a logit model, only the effect of APOE 
epsilon(4) remained significant. These observations diminish the possibility 
that loci in the TOMM40 gene may have a major effect on the risk for LOAD in 
Caucasians.
