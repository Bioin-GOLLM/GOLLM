Rationale: Peritoneal metastasis predicts poor prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) 
patients, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Methods: The 
2-DIGE, MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and single-cell transcriptome were used to detect 
differentially expressed proteins among normal gastric mucosa, primary GC and 
peritoneal metastatic tissues. Lentiviruses carrying shRNA and transcription 
activator-like effector nuclease technology were used to knock down myosin heavy 
chain 9 (MYH9) expression in GC cell lines. Immunofluorescence, immune 
transmission electron microscopy, chromatin fractionation, 
co-immunoprecipitation, and assays for chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual 
luciferase reporter, agarose-oligonucleotide pull-down, flow cytometry and cell 
anoikis were performed to uncover nuclear MYH9-induced β-catenin (CTNNB1) 
transcription in vitro. Nude mice and conditional transgenic mice were used to 
investigate the findings in vivo. Results: We observed that MYH9 was upregulated 
in metastatic GC tissues and was associated with a poor prognosis of GC 
patients. Mechanistically, we confirmed that MYH9 was mainly localized in the GC 
cell nuclei by four potential nuclear localization signals. Nuclear MYH9 bound 
to the CTNNB1 promoter through its DNA-binding domain, and interacted with 
myosin light chain 9, β-actin and RNA polymerase II to promote CTNNB1 
transcription, which conferred resistance to anoikis in GC cells in vitro and in 
vivo. Staurosporine reduced nuclear MYH9 S1943 phosphorylation to inhibit CTNNB1 
transcription, Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation and GC progression in both 
orthotropic xenograft GC nude mouse and transgenic GC mouse models. Conclusion: 
This study identified that nuclear MYH9-induced CTNNB1 expression promotes GC 
metastasis, which could be inhibited by staurosporine, indicating a novel 
therapy for GC peritoneal metastasis.
