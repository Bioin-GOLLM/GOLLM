The MYC oncogene contributes to the genesis of many human cancers. Recent 
insights into its expression and function have led to therapeutic opportunities. 
MYC's activation by bromodomain proteins could be inhibited by drug-like 
molecules, resulting in tumor inhibition in vivo. Tumor growth can also be 
curbed by pharmacologically uncoupling bioenergetic pathways involving glucose 
or glutamine metabolism from Myc-induced cellular biomass accumulation. Other 
approaches to halt Myc on the path to cancer involve targeting Myc-Max 
dimerization or Myc-induced microRNA expression. Here the richness of our 
understanding of MYC is reviewed, highlighting new biological insights and 
opportunities for cancer therapies.
