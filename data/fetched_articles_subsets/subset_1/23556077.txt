Since the discovery of mutant Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2), JAK2 V617F, in a major 
proportion of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients, there has been a 
flurry of activity in the development of JAK2 inhibitors. Pan-JAK, predominantly 
JAK2 and off-target JAK2 inhibitors have been developed in the short span of the 
past 5 years. These compounds have since been tested to varying success in both 
in vitro and in vivo settings with several proceeding on to advanced clinical 
trials. Although it was hoped that these inhibitors would be the silver bullet 
in the manner than imatinib was to chronic myeloid leukemia, it is becoming 
apparent that this is not the case for various reasons, chief of which is that a 
significant reduction of the underlying pathogenic clone is not achieved. In 
fact, the very notion that the target of JAK2 inhibitors (be it pan-JAK or JAK2 
specific) is the mutant JAK2 V617F is being challenged with findings from 
several clinical trials showing a poor correlation between the reduction in JAK2 
V617F mutant allele burden and clinical response. In view of this, it is not 
surprising that several groups are now investigating combinations of JAK2 
inhibitors and other agents in MPN. Although much knowledge has been added in 
this short span of time, it is apparent that our understanding of the role of 
JAK2 inhibitors in the treatment scheme of MPN is only beginning.
