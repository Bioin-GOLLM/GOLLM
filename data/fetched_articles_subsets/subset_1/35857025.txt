PURPOSE: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is not well-characterized in Asians, potentially 
resulting in delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis. We characterized CF in Asian 
subgroups to address these disparities.
METHODS: De-identified ethnicity and CFTR variant data were obtained from the 
United States, United Kingdom, and Canadian CF registries. We measured the 
prevalence of CF, CFTR variant allele frequencies, effectiveness of screening 
panels, and eligibility for modulator therapies.
RESULTS: The prevalence of CF was 1 in 74,982 people (Canada) to 1 in 13,340 
people (United Kingdom) for South Asians and 1 in 256,541 (Canada) to 1 in 
52,563 (United Kingdom) for other Asians, suggesting 26,000 to 146,000 patients 
with CF in South Asia. p.(F508del) variant was markedly less frequent in Asians 
than in non-Hispanic Whites. Splicing and nonsense variants occurred at high 
allelic frequencies in Asians, resulting in 41% to 49% of South Asians and 21% 
to 39% of other Asians being ineligible for CFTR modulator therapies. 
Hologic/EU2v1 panels failed to identify 37% to 47% of South Asian and 23% to 46% 
of other Asian patients with CF.
CONCLUSIONS: Among Asians, CF appears to be more common in South Asians. A 
significant CF population may exist in South Asia. CFTR variants in South and 
other Asians markedly differ from non-Hispanic Whites causing inequities in 
newborn screening, diagnosis, and treatment. New strategies are necessary to 
mitigate these health care disparities.
