INTRODUCTION: We report on a 4-year-old female patient who presented with severe 
intellectual disability, autistic features, hyperlaxity of joints, and 
progressive scoliosis. Whole-exome sequencing identified a de novo missense 
variant (c.976C>T; p.Arg326Cys) in DDX3X.
CASE PRESENTATION: The girl was born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia a 
finding which had not previously been associated with variants in DDX3X. Her 
brain MRI showed hypogenesis of corpus callosum, ventriculomegaly, frontal and 
perisylvian polymicrogyria, and hypoplastic pons in addition to Dandy-Walker 
malformation.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed the phenotype and genotype correlation of 
missense variants and the polymicrogyria. Moreover, it further expands the 
knowledge of the phenotypic and molecular features of DDX3X-related intellectual 
disability.
