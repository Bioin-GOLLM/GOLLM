O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is an X-linked gene product that is essential for 
normal development of the vertebrate embryo. It catalyses the O-GlcNAc 
posttranslational modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins and proteolytic 
maturation of the transcriptional coregulator Host cell factor 1 (HCF1). Recent 
studies have suggested that conservative missense mutations distal to the OGT 
catalytic domain lead to X-linked intellectual disability in boys, but it is not 
clear if this is through changes in the O-GlcNAc proteome, loss of 
protein-protein interactions, or misprocessing of HCF1. Here, we report an OGT 
catalytic domain missense mutation in monozygotic female twins (c. X:70779215 T 
> A, p. N567K) with intellectual disability that allows dissection of these 
effects. The patients show limited IQ with developmental delay and skewed 
X-inactivation. Molecular analyses revealed decreased OGT stability and 
disruption of the substrate binding site, resulting in loss of catalytic 
activity. Editing this mutation into the Drosophila genome results in global 
changes in the O-GlcNAc proteome, while in mouse embryonic stem cells it leads 
to loss of O-GlcNAcase and delayed differentiation down the neuronal lineage. 
These data imply that catalytic deficiency of OGT could contribute to X-linked 
intellectual disability.
