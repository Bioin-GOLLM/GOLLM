Mucosal delivery of vaccines against sexually transmitted pathogens is important 
to elicit strong immune responses at biologically relevant sites. However, 
inclusion of appropriate adjuvants is essential to overcome the inherent mucosal 
tolerance. We present evidence in support of the effectiveness of 
co-administering alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) as an adjuvant with a 
CTL-inducing HIV envelope peptide, via either oral or intranasal route, to prime 
antigen-specific immune responses in multiple systemic and mucosal compartments. 
Contrary to the known potential of repeated parenteral dosing with alpha-GalCer 
to induce NKT cell anergy that could compromise adoptive immunity development, 
we have observed that two and three doses delivered by the intranasal or oral 
route were more efficient in priming broader antigen-specific immune responses. 
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of alpha-GalCer as adjuvant for 
repeated intranasal or oral administration of vaccines for protection against 
mucosally transmitted pathogens.
