As one of the deadliest and most common malignancies in the world, gastric 
cancer (GC) represents a serious health threat. Despite recent advances in the 
field, the prognosis of patients with metastatic GC remains poor. In this study, 
we aimed to investigate the clinical impact of the alpha subunit of the nuclear 
structural protein thymopoietin (TMPO-α) in GC. The expression of TMPO-α in 
seven gastric cell lines was detected by immunoblotting. The expression level of 
TMPO-α levels in gastric tissues collected from 145 GC patients was examined by 
immunohistochemistry. The correlations between TMPO-α expression level and 
clinicopathologic parameters, as well as the association of TMPO-α expression 
with overall survival, were assessed. Immunohistochemistry showed that the 
expression of TMPO-α was significantly higher in GC tissues and cells in 
comparison with non-tumor tissues and cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of 
TMPO-α in gastric tissues (56%) was positively associated with Lauren 
classification (P = 0.0159), nodal status (P = 0.0265), distant metastasis (P < 
0.0001), stage (P = 0.0367), and degree of differentiation (P = 0.0009). 
Patients with high TMPO-α levels had a significantly poorer overall survival 
than those with low levels (P = 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis 
also indicated that TMPO-α was an independent prognostic marker for GC (P = 
0.045). In addition, studies conducted in GC cells indicated that knockdown of 
TMPO-α suppressed cell proliferation and invasion. These findings indicate that 
TMPO-α overexpression can predict clinicopathologic features and the outcome of 
patients with GC.
