BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in 
tumorigenesis. Vocal cord leukoplakia is a precancerous lesion in 
otolaryngological practice. Till now, the expression patterns and functions of 
lncRNAs in vocal cord leukoplakia have not been well understood. In this study, 
we used microarrays to investigate the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in 
vocal cord leukoplakia and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues.
METHODS: Gene Ontology and pathway analyses were performed to determine the 
significant function and pathways of the differentially expressed mRNAs. qRT-PCR 
was performed to further validate the expression of selected lncRNAs and mRNAs 
in vocal cord leukoplakia.
RESULTS: Our study identified 170 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 99 
differentially expressed mRNAs, including 142 up-regulated lncRNAs and 28 
down-regulated lncRNAs, and 54 up-regulated mRNAs and 45 down-regulated mRNAs. 
Among these, XLOC_000605 and DLX6-AS1 were the most aberrantly expressed 
lncRNAs. Furthermore, we identified an antisense lncRNA (LOC100506801), an 
enhancer-like lncRNA (AK057351) and three long intergenetic noncoding RNAs 
including XLOC_008001, XLOC_011989 and XLOC_007341.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that many lncRNAs were differentially 
expressed between vocal cord leukoplakia tissues and normal tissue, suggesting 
that they may play a key role in vocal cord leukoplakia tumorigenesis.
