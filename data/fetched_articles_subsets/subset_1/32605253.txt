Obesity is recognised as a risk factor for many types of cancers, in particular 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A critical factor in the development of HCC from 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the presence of non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH). Therapies aimed at NASH to reduce the risk of HCC are 
sparse and largely unsuccessful. Lifestyle modifications such as diet and 
regular exercise have poor adherence. Moreover, current pharmacological 
treatments such as pioglitazone and vitamin E have limited effects on fibrosis, 
a key risk factor in HCC progression. As NAFLD is becoming more prevalent in 
developed countries due to rising rates of obesity, a need for directed 
treatment is imperative. Numerous novel therapies including PPAR agonists, 
anti-fibrotic therapies and agents targeting inflammation, oxidative stress and 
the gut-liver axis are currently in development, with the aim of targeting key 
processes in the progression of NASH and HCC. Here, we critically evaluate 
literature on the aetiology of NAFLD-related HCC, and explore the potential 
treatment options for NASH and HCC.
