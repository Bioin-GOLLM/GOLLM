The eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) maintains protein homeostasis by 
eliminating unwanted proteins through the evolutionarily conserved ER-associated 
degradation (ERAD) pathway. During ERAD, maturation-defective and surplus 
polypeptides are evicted from the ER lumen and/or lipid bilayer through the 
process of retrotranslocation and ultimately degraded by the proteasome. An 
integral facet of the ERAD mechanism is the ubiquitin system, composed of the 
ubiquitin modifier and the factors for assembling, processing and binding 
ubiquitin chains on conjugated substrates. Beyond simply marking polypeptides 
for degradation, the ubiquitin system is functionally intertwined with 
retrotranslocation machinery to transport polypeptides across the ER membrane.
