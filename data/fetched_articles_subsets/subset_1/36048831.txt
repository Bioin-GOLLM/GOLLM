INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
(STAT3) has been identified as one of the cystic fibrosis (CF) modifying genes. 
In this study, we aimed to assess the association between STAT3 genotype and CF 
patient survival over several decades and to investigate the effect of STAT3 
inhibition on epithelial CFTR expression.
METHODS: We analyzed the informative genetic marker STAT3Sat for its association 
with survival in 174 p.Phe508del-CFTR homozygous CF patients treated at the CF 
center in Hannover spanning birth cohorts from >3 decades (1959-1994). 
Furthermore, we treated two epithelial cell lines with STAT3 inhibitors and 
monitored changes of CFTR protein expression by western blot.
RESULTS: Only for p.Phe508del-CFTR homozygous patients born prior to 1975, 
survival was significantly influenced by STAT3sat genotype (P = 0.023). The 
expression levels of STAT3 and CFTR positively correlated in epithelial cell 
lines (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results in different birth cohorts identified a time-dependent 
impact of STAT3 genotype on CF patients' survival and found that improved 
symptomatic treatment of later-born CF patients obviates STAT3's modifying 
influence. Consistent with our previous results, STAT3-specific inhibition 
resulted in increased CFTR expression in the epithelial cell line 16HBE14o-. 
Thus, care should be taken when CF-modifying genes are studied in 
cross-sectional cohorts as the impact of modifying genes might not be invariant 
in the light of changing therapeutic regimens.
