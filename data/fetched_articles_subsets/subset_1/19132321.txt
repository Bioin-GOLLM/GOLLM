Interactions between the TNF-family receptor Fas (CD95) and Fas Ligand (FasL, 
CD178) can efficiently induce apoptosis and are critical for the maintenance of 
immunological self-tolerance. FasL is kept under strict control by 
transcriptional and posttranslational regulation. Surface FasL can be cleaved by 
metalloproteases, resulting in shed extracellular domains, and FasL can also 
traffic to secretory lysosomes. Each form of FasL has distinct biological 
functions. Fas is more ubiquitously expressed, but its apoptosis-inducing 
function is regulated by a number of mechanisms including submembrane 
localization, efficiency of receptor signaling complex assembly and activation, 
and bcl-2 family members in some circumstances. When apoptosis is not induced, 
Fas-FasL interactions can also trigger a number of activating and 
proinflammatory signals. Harnessing the apoptosis-inducing potential of Fas for 
therapy of cancer and autoimmune disease has been actively pursued, and despite 
a number of unexpected side-effects that result from manipulating Fas-FasL 
interactions, this remains a worthy goal.
