OBJECTIVE: To understand the region point mutations and single nucleotide 
polymorphisms characteristic of keratoconus candidate gene in Chinese 
population, the TGFBI.
METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and 
DNA direct sequencing were performed on blood samples from 30 cases of 
keratoconus patients and 30 normal controls. 17 exons from the coding region of 
TGFBI gene were examined for point mutations and single nucleotide 
polymorphisms.
RESULTS: Two types of base mutation were found in exon 12, which were both 
heterozygous. In 1 patient the site 535 showed GGA→TGA substitution, which was 
the change from glycine to stop codon (G535X). This was not found in all control 
cases. In 2 patients and 1 control case the site 540 showed TTT→TTC 
substitutions without changing of the coding for phenylalanine (F540F), 
suggesting for the polymorphism.
CONCLUSION: The candidate keratoconus gene TGFB1 showed genetic variation and 
mutation in keratoconus population. The gene might play a role in the 
development of keratoconus in Chinese population.
