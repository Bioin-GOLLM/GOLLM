The identification of specific molecular aberrations guides the prognostic 
stratification and management of grade 2 astrocytomas. Mutations in isocitrate 
dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2, found in the majority of adult diffuse low-grade 
glioma (DLGG), seem to relate to a favorable prognosis compared to IDH wild-type 
(IDH-wt) counterparts. Moreover, the IDH-wt group can develop additional 
molecular alterations worsening the prognosis, such as epidermal growth factor 
receptor amplification (EGFR-amp) and mutation of the promoter of telomerase 
reverse transcriptase (pTERT-mut). This review analyzes the prognostic impact 
and therapeutic implications of genetic alterations in adult LGG.
