Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a highly aggressive subtype of the 
neuroendocrine tumor with an extremely poor prognosis. We have previously 
conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of over 100 cases of NEC of the 
gastrointestinal system (GIS-NEC) and unraveled its unique and organ-specific 
genomic drivers. However, the epigenomic features of GIS-NEC remain unexplored. 
In this study, we have described the epigenomic landscape of GIS-NEC and small 
cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) by integrating motif enrichment analysis from the 
assay of transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and enhancer 
profiling from a novel cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) assay 
for H3K27ac and identified ELF3 as one of the super-enhancer-related 
transcriptional factors in NEC. By combining CUT&Tag and knockdown RNA 
sequencing for ELF3, we uncovered the transcriptional network regulated by ELF3 
and defined its distinctive gene signature, including AURKA, CDC25B, CLDN4, 
ITGB6, and YWAHB. Furthermore, a loss-of-function assay revealed that ELF3 
depletion led to poor cell viability. Finally, using gene expression of clinical 
samples, we successfully divided GIS-NEC patients into two subgroups according 
to the ELF3 signature and demonstrated that tumor-promoting pathways were 
activated in the ELF3 signature-high group. Our findings highlight the 
transcriptional regulation of ELF3 as an oncogenic transcription factor and its 
tumor-promoting properties in NEC.
