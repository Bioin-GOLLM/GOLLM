BACKGROUND: Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2) participates in 
pre-mRNA splicing and DNA damage response, which is implicated in 
spermatogenesis and meiosis initiation in mouse. Nevertheless, the physiological 
roles of BCAS2 in the testes of large mammals especially boars remain largely 
unknown.
METHODS: In this study, testes were collected from Hezuo pig at three 
development stages including 30 days old (30 d), 120 days old (120 d), and 240 
days old (240 d). BCAS2 CDS region was firstly cloned using RT-PCR method, and 
its molecular characteristics were identified using relevant bioinformatics 
software. Additionally, the expression patterns and cellular localization of 
BCAS2 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot, 
immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: The cloning and sequence analysis indicated that the Hezuo pig BCAS2 
CDS fragment encompassed 678 bp open reading frame (ORF) capable of encoding 225 
amino acid residues, and possessed high identities with some other mammals. The 
results of qRT-PCR and Western blot displayed that BCAS2 levels both mRNA and 
protein were age-dependent increased (p < 0.01). Additionally, 
immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence results revealed that BCAS2 protein 
was mainly observed in nucleus of gonocytes at 30 d testes as well as nucleus of 
spermatogonia and Sertoli cells at 120 and 240 d testes. Accordingly, we 
conclude that BCAS2 is critical for testicular development and spermatogenesis 
of Hezuo pig, perhaps by regulating proliferation or differentiation of 
gonocytes, pre-mRNA splicing of spermatogonia and functional maintenance of 
Sertoli cells, but specific mechanism still requires be further investigated.
