Our knowledge of whole organism physiology has greatly advanced in the past 
decades through mouse genetics. In particular, genetic studies have revealed 
that most organs interact with one another through hormones in order to maintain 
normal physiological functions and the homeostasis of the entire organism. 
Remarkably, through these studies many unexpected novel endocrine means to 
regulate physiological functions have been uncovered. The skeletal system is one 
example. In this article, we review a series of studies that over the years have 
identified bone as an endocrine organ. The mechanism of action, pathological 
relevance, and therapeutic implications of the functions of the bone-derived 
hormone osteocalcin are discussed. In the last part of this review we discuss 
the possibility that additional endocrine functions of the skeleton may exist.
