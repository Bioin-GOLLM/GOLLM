Numerous targeted therapies have been developed for diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma, but the results of late-stage clinical trials were mostly 
disappointing and have led to very few new regulatory approvals. Here, we use 
single and combinatorial drug response profiling to show that the combined 
inhibition of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and of the tyrosine kinase BTK 
with the small molecules venetoclax and ibrutinib efficiently kills DLBCL cells 
in vitro. High Bcl-2 expression due to either BCL2 amplifications or 
translocations, in conjunction with chronic active BCR signaling accurately 
predict responses to dual Bcl-2/BTK inhibition. Orthotopic xenotransplantation 
and patient-derived xenograft models confirm that the combinatorial is superior 
to single-agent treatment in reducing the lymphoma burden. Combinatorial 
treatment further efficiently overcomes both primary and acquired resistance to 
venetoclax, which we could link to reduced expression of the Bcl-2 family 
members Bcl-XL and Bcl-2A1 under ibrutinib. We found in a Swiss DLBCL cohort 
that ~15% of patients are projected to respond to the venetoclax/ibrutinib 
combination based on their high Bcl-2 expression and nuclear NF-κB localization. 
Our data show that drug sensitivities exposed by drug response profiling can be 
attributed to specific mutational signatures and immunohistochemical biomarkers, 
and point to combined Bcl-2/BTK inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy 
in DLBCL.
