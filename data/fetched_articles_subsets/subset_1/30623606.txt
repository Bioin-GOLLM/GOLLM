BACKGROUND: Regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1), a telomere 
length-related gene, is closely linked to cancer and age-related diseases. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic 
polymorphisms in the RTEL1 gene and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.
METHODS: In this case-control study, which includes samples from 596 CHD 
patients and 603 healthy controls, five SNPs in RTEL1 were selected. The 
genotypes were studied using the Agena MassARRAY platform, and the statistical 
analyses were performed using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, genetic 
model analysis, and haplotype analysis.
RESULTS: In the allele model, using the chi-square test, we found that the 
patients with the "G" allele of rs6010620 and the "C" allele of rs4809324 in the 
RTEL1 gene showed a decreased risk of CHD once the results were adjusted for age 
and gender. In the genetic model, logistic regression analyses revealed that the 
rs6010620 polymorphism conferred a decreased risk of CHD in the codominant model 
(OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.31-0.88, p = 0.007 for the "G/G" genotype) and the 
recessive model (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.30-0.80, p = 0.004 for the "G/G" 
genotype). In addition, the haplotype "Grs6010620 Trs6010621 Trs4809324 " of 
RTEL1 was associated with a 0.03-fold decreased risk of CHD once the results 
were adjusted for age and gender (OR = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01-0.12, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings have demonstrated that the genetic variants of RTEL1 
may have a protective role against CHD risk.
