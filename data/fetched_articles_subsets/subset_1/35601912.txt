Commensal bacteria are known to promote host growth. Such effect partly relies 
on the capacity of microbes to regulate the host's transcriptional response. 
However, these evidences mainly come from comparing the transcriptional response 
caused by commensal bacteria with that of axenic animals, making it difficult to 
identify the animal genes that are specifically regulated by beneficial 
microbes. Here, we employ Drosophila melanogaster associated with 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum to understand the host genetic pathways regulated 
by beneficial bacteria and leading to improved host growth. We show that 
microbial benefit to the host relies on the downregulation of 
peptidoglycan-recognition proteins. Specifically, we report that bacterial 
proliferation triggers the lower expression of PGRP-SC1 in larval midgut, which 
ultimately leads to improved host growth and development. Our study helps 
elucidate the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect exerted by commensal 
bacteria, defining the role of immune effectors in the relationship between 
Drosophila and its gut microbes.
