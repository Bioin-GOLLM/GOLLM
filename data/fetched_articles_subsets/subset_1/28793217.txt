Elastic properties of cells are mainly derived from the actin cytoskeleton. 
However, intermediate filaments are emerging as major contributors to the 
mechanical properties of cells. Using atomic force microscopy, we studied the 
elasticity of mouse myoblasts expressing a mutant form of the gene encoding for 
desmin intermediate filaments, p.D399Y. This variant produces desmin aggregates, 
the main pathological symptom of myofibrillar myopathies. Here we show that 
desmin-mutated cells display a 39% increased median elastic modulus compared to 
wild-type cells. Desmin-mutated cells required higher forces than wild-type 
cells to reach high indentation depths, where desmin intermediate filaments are 
typically located. In addition, heat-shock treatment increased the proportion of 
cells with aggregates and induced a secondary peak in the distribution of 
Young's moduli. By performing atomic force microscopy mechanical mapping 
combined with fluorescence microscopy, we show that higher Young's moduli were 
measured where desmin aggregates were located, indicating that desmin aggregates 
are rigid. Therefore, we provide evidence that p.D399Y stiffens mouse myoblasts. 
Based on these results, we suggest that p.D399Y-related myofibrillar myopathy is 
at least partly due to altered mechanical properties at the single-cell scale, 
which are propagated to the tissue scale.
