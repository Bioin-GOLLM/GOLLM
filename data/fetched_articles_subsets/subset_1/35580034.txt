BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of 
synthetic (man-made) chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial 
processes. Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 
(PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the 
challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic 
evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of 
PFAS.
OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and 
animal bioassay evidence for a set of  ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 
by the U.S. EPA's Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in 
vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing.
METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature 
using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, 
Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian 
animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard 
identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including 
information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement-only studies in 
humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal 
bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with 
respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal 
bioassay studies with  ≥ 21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental 
study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study 
evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly 
available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata.
RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. 
Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the 
peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray 
literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 
PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, 
cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) 
commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, 
immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal 
and epidemiology data streams.
DISCUSSION: Many of the  ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal 
evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By 
disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work 
by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research 
needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete 
understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures.
