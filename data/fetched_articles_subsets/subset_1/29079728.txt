Genome-wide, imputed, sequence, and structural data are now available for 
exceedingly large sample sizes. The needs for data management, handling 
population structure and related samples, and performing associations have 
largely been met. However, the infrastructure to support analyses involving 
complexity beyond genome-wide association studies is not standardized or 
centralized. We provide the PLatform for the Analysis, Translation, and 
Organization of large-scale data (PLATO), a software tool equipped to handle 
multi-omic data for hundreds of thousands of samples to explore complexity using 
genetic interactions, environment-wide association studies and gene-environment 
interactions, phenome-wide association studies, as well as copy number and rare 
variant analyses. Using the data from the Marshfield Personalized Medicine 
Research Project, a site in the electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network, 
we apply each feature of PLATO to type 2 diabetes and demonstrate how PLATO can 
be used to uncover the complex etiology of common traits.
