Epigenetics is nowadays a well-accepted area of research. In the last years, 
tremendous progress was made regarding molecules targeting EZH2, directly or 
indirectly. Recently tazemetostat hit the market after FDA-approval for the 
treatment of lymphoma. However, the impairment of EZH2 activity by orthosteric 
intervention has proven to be effective only in a limited subset of cancers. 
Considering the multiproteic nature of the PRC2 complex and the marked 
dependence of EZH2 functions on the other core subunits such as EED, in recent 
years, a new targeting approach ascended to prominence. The possibility to 
cripple the function of the PRC2 complex by interfering with its multimeric 
integrity fueled the interest in developing EZH2-EED protein-protein interaction 
and EED inhibitors as indirect modulators of PRC2-dependent methyltransferase 
activity. In this Perspective, we aim to summarize the latest findings regarding 
the development and the biological activity of these emerging classes of PRC2 
modulators from a medicinal chemist's viewpoint.
