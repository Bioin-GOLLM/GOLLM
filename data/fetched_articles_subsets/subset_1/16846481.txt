The fibrinogen Aalpha R16C mutation is a common cause of dysfibrinogenaemia and 
has been previously associated with both bleeding and thrombosis. However, the 
mechanism underlying the thrombotic phenotype has not yet been elucidated. This 
report characterises the defect in fibrinolysis seen as a result of the Aalpha 
R16C mutation. A young patient with dysfibrinogenaemia (fibrinogen Hershey III) 
was found to be heterozygous for the Aalpha R16C mutation. Functional assays 
were performed on the purified fibrinogen to characterise clot formation and 
lysis with plasmin and trypsin. Consistent with previous results, clot formation 
was diminished. Unexpectedly, fibrinolysis was also delayed. Plasminogen 
activation was normal, ruling out decreased plasmin generation as the mechanism 
behind the fibrinolytic resistance. Western blot analysis showed no difference 
in the amount of bound alpha2-antiplasmin or albumin. When clot lysis was 
assayed with trypsin substituted for plasminogen, a significant delay was also 
observed, indicating that defective binding to plasminogen could not explain the 
fibrinolytic resistance. These results suggest that the defective fibrinolysis 
is due to increased proteolytic resistance, most likely reflecting changes in 
clot structure.
