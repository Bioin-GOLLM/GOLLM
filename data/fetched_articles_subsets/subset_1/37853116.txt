Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is a rare congenital eye movement disorder 
causing by the dysplasia of abducens nerve, and has highly variable phenotype. 
MRI can reveal the endophenotype of DRS. Most DRS cases are sporadical and 
isolated, while some are familial or accompanied by other ocular disorders and 
systemic congenital abnormalities. CHN1 was the most common causative gene for 
familial DRS. Until now, 13 missense variants of CHN1 have been reported. In 
this study, we enrolled two unrelated pedigrees with DRS. Detailed clinical 
examinations, MRI, and the whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed to reveal 
their clinical and genetic characteristics. Patients from pedigree-1 presented 
with isolated DRS, and a novel heterozygous variant c.650 A > G, p. His217Arg 
was identified in CHN1 gene. Patients from pedigree-2 presented with classic DRS 
and abnormalities in auricle morphology, and the pedigree segregated another 
novel heterozygous CHN1 variant c.637 T > C, p. Phe213Leu. A variety of 
bioinformatics software predicted that the two variants had deleterious or 
disease-causing effects. After injecting of two mutant CHN1 mRNAs into zebrafish 
embryos, the dysplasia of ocular motor nerves (OMN) was observed. Our present 
findings expanded the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of CHN1 related DRS, as 
well as provided new insights into the role of CHN1 in OMN development. Genetic 
testing is strongly recommended for patients with a DRS family history or 
accompanying systemic congenital abnormalities.
