Objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinicopathological findings 
and the efficacy of the treatment modalities used in patients with olfactory 
neuroblastomas. Study Design. Retrospective record review. Setting. Istanbul 
University, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, medical oncology outpatient clinic. 
Subjects and Methods. There were 3 stage A tumors, 5 stage B and 11 stage C 
according to the Kadish staging system. There were 5 grade I/II and 12 grade 
III/IV according to the Hyams' histopathologic system. Involvement to orbita was 
detected in eight patients at the time of diagnosis. Results. The median 
follow-up period was 23.7 months. The 5-year survival rate for the whole group 
was 26%. The stage A/B groups exhibited a better survival rate than the C group 
with 2-year survival rates being 25 versus 71% respectively (P = .008). The 
grade I/II groups exhibited a better survival rate than the grade III/IV groups 
with 2-year survival rates being 50 versus 16% respectively (P = .001). The 
group who had orbital involvement exhibited a poor survival rate than the group 
of patients who had no involvement of the orbital. Conclusion. In our study, 
tumor stage, histopathologic grading, involvement of the orbita, brain and bone 
marow metastases were the statistically significant prognostic factors.
