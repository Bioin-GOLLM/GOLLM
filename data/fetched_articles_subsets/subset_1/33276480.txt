The pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the loss of 
neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars 
compacta (SNpc). Additionally, numerous studies indicate an altered synaptic 
function during disease progression. To gain new insights into the molecular 
processes underlying the alteration of synaptic function in PD, a proteomic 
study was performed. Therefore, synaptosomes were isolated by density gradient 
centrifugation from SNpc tissue of individuals at advanced PD stages (N = 5) as 
well as control subjects free of pathology (N = 5) followed by mass 
spectrometry-based analysis. In total, 362 proteins were identified and assigned 
to the synaptosomal core proteome. This core proteome comprised all proteins 
expressed within the synapses without regard to data analysis software, gender, 
age, or disease. The differential analysis between control subjects and PD cases 
revealed that CD9 antigen was overrepresented and fourteen proteins, among them 
Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2), mitochondrial, 39S ribosomal protein L37, neurolysin, 
and Methionine-tRNA ligase (MARS2) were underrepresented in PD suggesting an 
alteration in mitochondrial translation within synaptosomes.
