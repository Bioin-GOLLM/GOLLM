Although most work has focused on resolution of collagen ECM, fibrosis 
resolution involves changes to several ECM proteins. The purpose of the current 
study was twofold: 1) to examine the role of MMP12 and elastin; and 2) to 
investigate the changes in degraded proteins in plasma (i.e., the "degradome") 
in a preclinical model of fibrosis resolution. Fibrosis was induced by 4 weeks 
carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) exposure, and recovery was monitored for an 
additional 4 weeks. Some mice were treated with daily MMP12 inhibitor (MMP408) 
during the resolution phase. Liver injury and fibrosis was monitored by clinical 
chemistry, histology and gene expression. The release of degraded ECM peptides 
in the plasma was analyzed using by 1D-LC-MS/MS, coupled with PEAKS Studio (v10) 
peptide identification. Hepatic fibrosis and liver injury rapidly resolved in 
this mouse model. However, some collagen fibrils were still present 28d after 
cessation of CCl4. Despite this persistent collagen presence, expression of 
canonical markers of fibrosis were also normalized. The inhibition of MMP12 
dramatically delayed fibrosis resolution under these conditions. LC-MS/MS 
analysis identified that several proteins were being degraded even at late 
stages of fibrosis resolution. Calpains 1/2 were identified as potential new 
proteases involved in fibrosis resolution. CONCLUSION. The results of this study 
indicate that remodeling of the liver during recovery from fibrosis is a complex 
and highly coordinated process that extends well beyond the degradation of the 
collagenous scar. These results also indicate that analysis of the plasma 
degradome may yield new insight into the mechanisms of fibrosis recovery, and by 
extension, new "theragnostic" targets. Lastly, a novel potential role for 
calpain activation in the degradation and turnover of proteins was identified.
