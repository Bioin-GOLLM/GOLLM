BACKGROUND: An increasing body of studies has investigated that genetic 
polymorphisms in microRNA (miRNA) may be related to susceptibility to rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, some results 
remain controversial. Thus, a meta-analysis was embarked on assessing whether 
some miRNA polymorphisms are associated with the risk of RA and SLE.
METHODS: Relevant studies were acquired on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane 
Library, CNKI, and Embase electronic databases from inception to December 2019. 
The strength of the association of miRNA polymorphisms with the risk of RA and 
SLE was assessed by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Eligible 20 articles (36 studies) involving 5 miRNAs were enrolled in 
the meta-analysis. For RA, the polled result showed that there was no 
significant relationship between miR-146a rs2910164 and RA, but subgroup 
analysis based on ethnicity demonstrated that CC genotype may be a genetic 
protect factor for RA in Caucasians (CC vs CG+GG, OR = 0.825, 95% CI: 
0.684-0.996, Pz = .045, Ph = .166). Besides, statistical significance of miR-499 
rs3746444 (T/C) with susceptibility to RA was observed as well in the overall 
population, and the association was only significant in Caucasians but not 
Asians. For SLE, the associations of miR-146a rs2431697 T allele/T-carrier with 
increased risk of SLE were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight that miR-499 rs3746444 may contribute to RA 
susceptibility, particularly in Caucasians. In addition, CC genotype in miR-146a 
rs2910164 may act as a protector of RA in Caucasians. For SLE, miR-146a 
rs2431697 (C/T) is most likely to the increased the risk of SLE. These findings 
do not support the genetic association between miR-196a2 rs11614913 and RA/SLE 
susceptibility, as well as the association of miR-146a rs2910164, miR-146a 
rs57095329, miR-499 rs3746444 with SLE.
