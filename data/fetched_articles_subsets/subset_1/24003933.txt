Emerging data illustrate a pivotal role for activation of β-cell endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress pathways in diabetes pathophysiology. The purpose of this 
review is to appraise the evidence for β-cell ER stress in human type 1 and 2 
diabetes, review the molecular signalling pathways involved in the unfolded 
protein response and ER stress signalling, and to provide data from polyribosome 
profiling to illustrate the impact of ER stress on the mRNA translation 
response. Finally, we will discuss existing and novel therapeutic strategies 
that target β-cell ER stress and discuss their use in rodent and human type 1 
and 2 diabetes.
