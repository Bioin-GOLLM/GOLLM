Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus responsible for a severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is accountable for a major pandemic situation. 
The emergence of the B.1.1.7 strain, as a highly transmissible variant has 
accelerated the world-wide interest in tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants' occurrence. 
Similarly, other extremely infectious variants, were described and further 
others are expected to be discovered due to the long period of time on which the 
pandemic situation is lasting. All described SARS-CoV-2 variants present several 
mutations within the gene encoding the Spike protein, involved in host receptor 
recognition and entry into the cell. Hence, instead of sequencing the whole 
viral genome for variants' tracking, herein we propose to focus on the SPIKE 
region to increase the number of candidate samples to screen at once; an 
essential aspect to accelerate diagnostics, but also variants' 
emergence/progression surveillance. This proof of concept study accomplishes 
both at once, population-scale diagnostics and variants' tracking. This strategy 
relies on (1) the use of the portable MinION DNA sequencer; (2) a DNA barcoding 
and a SPIKE gene-centered variant's tracking, increasing the number of 
candidates per assay; and (3) a real-time diagnostics and variant's tracking 
monitoring thanks to our software RETIVAD. This strategy represents an optimal 
solution for addressing the current needs on SARS-CoV-2 progression 
surveillance, notably due to its affordable implementation, allowing its 
implantation even in remote places over the world.
