Introduction Schizophrenia is recognized as one of the most important mental 
illnesses of the last century. Many genetic and environmental factors are 
involved in this condition. Recently, the genome-wide association study 
identified two significant genes LRP8 and CEP85L associated with psychiatric 
disorders. LRP8 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8) acts as a 
cytoplasmic receptor for Reelin. Many studies have revealed that LRP8 was 
significantly related to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in Chinese 
population. CEP85L standing for 'centrosomal protein 85 kDa-like' is another 
gene, which has been reportedly associated with BPD. Methods We performed a 
case-control study to analyze the association between rs5177 single-nucleotide 
polymorphism in the LRP8 gene plus the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11756438 
in the CEP85L gene and schizophrenia in the Iranian population. The genotype for 
rs5177 was determined by ARMS PCR method, while for rs11756438 genotype, it was 
determined by PCR-RFLP method after which statistical analysis was performed for 
each polymorphism. In rs5177, the CC genotype was susceptible to the disease 
while G allele was associated with disease protection. Results and Conclusion In 
rs11756438, the AA genotype was associated with disease susceptibility, while 
allele A did not have a significant association with the disease.
