Shiga toxins consist of an A-moiety and five B-moieties able to bind the neutral 
glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) on the cell surface. To intoxicate 
cells efficiently, the toxin A-moiety has to be cleaved by furin and transported 
retrogradely to the Golgi apparatus and to the endoplasmic reticulum. The 
enzymatically active part of the A-moiety is then translocated to the cytosol, 
where it inhibits protein synthesis and in some cell types induces apoptosis. 
Protection of cells can be provided either by inhibiting binding of the toxin to 
cells or by interfering with any of the subsequent steps required for its toxic 
effect. In this article we provide a brief overview of the interaction of Shiga 
toxins with cells, describe some compounds and conditions found to protect cells 
against Shiga toxins, and discuss whether they might also provide protection in 
animals and humans.
