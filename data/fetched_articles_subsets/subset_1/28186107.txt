Stress can compromise an animal's ability to conserve metabolic stores and 
participate in energy-demanding activities that are critical for fitness. 
Understanding how wild animals, especially those already experiencing 
physiological extremes (e.g. fasting), regulate stress responses is critical for 
evaluating the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on physiology and fitness, 
key challenges for conservation. However, studies of stress in wildlife are 
often limited to baseline endocrine measurements and few have investigated 
stress effects in fasting-adapted species. We examined downstream molecular 
consequences of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation by 
exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in blubber of northern elephant 
seals due to the ease of blubber sampling and its key role in metabolic 
regulation in marine mammals. We report the first phocid blubber transcriptome 
produced by RNAseq, containing over 140,000 annotated transcripts, including 
metabolic and adipocytokine genes of interest. The acute response of blubber to 
stress axis activation, measured 2 hours after ACTH administration, involved 
highly specific, transient (lasting <24 hours) induction of gene networks that 
promote lipolysis and adipogenesis in mammalian adipocytes. Differentially 
expressed genes included key adipogenesis factors which can be used as 
blubber-specific markers of acute stress in marine mammals of concern for which 
sampling of other tissues is not possible.
