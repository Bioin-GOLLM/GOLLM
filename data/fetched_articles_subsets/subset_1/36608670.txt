The TFE3 and MITF master transcription factors maintain metabolic homeostasis by 
regulating lysosomal, melanocytic, and autophagy genes. Previous studies posited 
that their cytosolic retention by 14-3-3, mediated by the Rag GTPases-mTORC1, 
was key for suppressing transcriptional activity in the presence of nutrients. 
Here, we demonstrate using mammalian cells that regulated protein stability 
plays a fundamental role in their control. Amino acids promote the recruitment 
of TFE3 and MITF to the lysosomal surface via the Rag GTPases, activating an 
evolutionarily conserved phospho-degron and leading to ubiquitination by 
CUL1β-TrCP and degradation. Elucidation of the minimal functional degron 
revealed a conserved alpha-helix required for interaction with RagA, 
illuminating the molecular basis for a severe neurodevelopmental syndrome caused 
by missense mutations in TFE3 within the RagA-TFE3 interface. Additionally, the 
phospho-degron is recurrently lost in TFE3 genomic translocations that cause 
kidney cancer. Therefore, two divergent pathologies converge on the loss of 
protein stability regulation by nutrients.
