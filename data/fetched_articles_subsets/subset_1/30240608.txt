Soluble Aβ oligomers (oAβs) contribute importantly to synaptotoxicity in 
Alzheimer disease (AD), but the mechanisms related to heterogeneity of synaptic 
functions at local circuits remain elusive. Nearly all studies of the effects of 
oAβs on hippocampal synaptic plasticity have only examined homosynaptic 
plasticity. Here we stimulated the Schaffer collaterals and then simultaneously 
recorded in stratum radiatum (apical dendrites) and stratum oriens (basal 
dendrites) of CA1 neurons. We found that the apical dendrites are significantly 
more vulnerable to oAβ-mediated synaptic dysfunction: the heterosynaptic basal 
dendritic long-term potentiation (LTP) remained unchanged, whereas the 
homosynaptic apical LTP was impaired. However, the heterosynaptic basal 
dendritic plasticity induced by either spaced 10-Hz bursts or low-frequency 
(1-Hz) stimulation was disrupted by oAβs in a mGluR5-dependent manner. These 
results suggest that different firing patterns in the same neurons may be 
selectively altered by soluble oAβs in an early phase of AD, before frank 
neurodegeneration.
