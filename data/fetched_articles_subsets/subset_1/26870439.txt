In the title complex, [Ni(C16H15N3O2S)(C18H15P)], the Ni(II) atom has a 
distorted tetra-hedral coordination geometry, comprised of N, S, O and P atoms 
of the tridentate thiosemicarbazide ligand and the P atom of the 
triphenylphosphane ligand. The benzene ring makes a dihedral angle of 
53.08 (11)° with the phenyl ring of the phenyl-thio-semicarbazide moiety and 
dihedral angles of 73.69 (11), 20.38 (11) and 71.30 (11)° with the phenyl rings 
of tri-phenyl-phosphane ligand. A pair of N-H⋯N hydrogen bonds generates an R 2 
(2)(8) ring graph-set motif. The eth-oxy group is disordered over two positions, 
with site occupancies of 0.631 (9) and 0.369 (9). The mol-ecular structure is 
stabilized by a weak intra-molecular C-H⋯O hydrogen bond. In the crystal, weak 
N-H⋯N and C-H⋯π inter-actions connect the mol-ecules, forming a 
three-dimensional network.
