Mast cells are responsible for the majority of allergic conditions. It was 
originally thought that almost all allergic events were mediated directly only 
via the high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptors. However, recent evidence 
showed that many other receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors and 
ligand-gated ion channels, are also directly involved in mast cell 
degranulation, the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, serine 
proteases, leukotrienes, heparin, and serotonin. These mediators are responsible 
for the symptoms in allergic conditions such as allergic asthma. In recent 
years, it has been realized that purinergic signaling, induced via the 
activation of G protein-coupled adenosine receptors and P2Y nucleotide 
receptors, as well as by ATP-gated P2X receptors, plays a significant role in 
mast cell degranulation. Both adenosine and ATP can induce degranulation and 
bronchoconstriction on their own and synergistically with allergens. All three 
classes of receptors, adenosine, P2X and P2Y are involved in tracheal mucus 
secretion. This review will summarize the currently available knowledge on the 
role of purinergic signaling in mast cell degranulation and its most relevant 
disease, asthma.
