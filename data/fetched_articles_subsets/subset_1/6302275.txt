Actin gene family of Caenorhabditis elegans.

Files JG, Carr S, Hirsh D.

Four actin genes have been isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans that account for 
all of the major actin hybridization to total genomic DNA. Actin genes I, II and 
III are clustered within a 12 X 10(3) base region; gene IV is unlinked to the 
others. All four genes have been sequenced from at least nucleotide -109 to 
+250. Genes I and III are identical for the first 307 coding nucleotides. Genes 
I and II differ in 14 positions within the first 250 coding nucleotides; one 
difference substitutes an aspartic acid for a glutamic acid at codon 5. Genes I 
and IV differ in 18 positions within the first 259 coding nucleotides without 
causing any amino acid differences. Genes I, II and III have introns after the 
first nucleotide of codon 64 and gene IV has an intron between codons 19 and 20. 
The four nucleotide sequences thus far define two different amino acid 
sequences. Both of the amino acid sequences resemble vertebrate cytoplasmic 
actin more than vertebrate muscle actin. A DNA polymorphism between the Bristol 
and Bergerac strains has been used as a phenotypic marker in genetic crosses to 
map the cluster of actin genes within a 2% recombination interval on linkage 
group V between unc-23 and sma-1 in order to begin a molecular genetic analysis 
of the actin loci.
