INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a painful complex neurovascular disease characterized 
by recurrent moderate-to-severe headaches. Increased level of homocysteine is 
related to dilation of cerebral vessels and endothelial injury that could 
trigger migraine attacks. Functional polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene affect 
homocysteine metabolism and, therefore, play an important role in the etiology 
of the disease.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the possible association between MTHFR gene 
rs4846049, C677T, and A1298C polymorphisms and the risk of migraine in Iranian 
population.
METHODS: In this genetic association study, 498 individuals were enrolled, 
including 223 migraine patients and 275 healthy controls. Genotyping was 
performed using tetra-primer ARMS-PCR for rs4846049 and PCR-restriction fragment 
length polymorphism for C677T and A1298C polymorphisms.
RESULTS: The association between rs4846049 and C677T polymorphisms and migraine 
was observed. For the rs4846049 polymorphism, the association was detected under 
a dominant model (P=0.007; odds ratio [OR] =0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.41-0.87), and for the C677T polymorphism, the TT genotype frequency was 
significantly different in the studied groups (P=0.009; OR =2.48; 95% CI, 
1.25-4.92). No significant differences in the genotype or allele frequencies 
were found for the A1298C polymorphism between the migraineurs and controls.
CONCLUSION: Present data provide evidence for the association of rs4846049 and 
C677T polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene and migraine. Further studies are required 
to validate the significance of the studied genetic variations in diverse ethnic 
populations.
