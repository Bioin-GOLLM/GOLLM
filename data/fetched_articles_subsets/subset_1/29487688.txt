Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by 
α galactosidase A (α-gal A) deficiency. Central nervous system involvement and 
chronic white matter lesions are observed in both FD and multiple sclerosis 
(MS), which can confound the differential diagnosis. We analyzed the GLA gene, 
which encodes α-gal A, in 86 patients with clinical and neuroradiological 
findings consistent with MS to determine whether they had FD. We identified four 
women initially diagnosed with MS who had GLA mutations associated with FD. Our 
results indicate that family history besides neurological findings should be 
evaluated in patients with an uncertain diagnosis of MS. Also the involvement of 
organs outside the central nervous system can support the FD diagnosis.
