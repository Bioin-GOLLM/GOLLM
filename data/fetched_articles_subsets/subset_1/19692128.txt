Th1/Th17 cells, secreting both IFNgamma and IL-17, are often associated with 
inflammatory pathology. We cloned and studied the cytokine phenotypes of 
MBP-specific, TCR-identical encephalitogenic CD4+ cells in relationship to Th1- 
and Th17-associated transcription factors T-bet and RORgammat. 
IFNgamma-producing cells could be sub-divided into those that are 
T-bet(+)/RORgammat(-) and those that are T-bet(+)/RORgammat(+). The latter 
comprises a spectrum of phenotypes, as defined by IL-17 production, and can be 
induced to up-regulate IL-23R with IL-12 or IL-23. The former, bona fide Th1 
cells, lack IL-23R expression under all conditions. In vivo, 
T-bet(+)/RORgammat(-) and T-bet(+)/RORgammat(+) clones induce EAE equally well.
