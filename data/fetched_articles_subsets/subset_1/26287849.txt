BACKGROUND: BRAF V600 mutations occur in various nonmelanoma cancers. We 
undertook a histology-independent phase 2 "basket" study of vemurafenib in BRAF 
V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers.
METHODS: We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with 
all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients 
with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with 
colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point 
was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and 
overall survival.
RESULTS: In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 
42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free 
survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with 
Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 
43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 
to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were 
anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, 
anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian 
cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who 
received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies 
of vemurafenib for melanoma.
CONCLUSIONS: BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, 
nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in 
non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell 
histiocytosis. The histologic context is an important determinant of response in 
BRAF V600-mutated cancers. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech;
