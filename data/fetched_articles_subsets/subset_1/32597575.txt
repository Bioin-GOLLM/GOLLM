BACKGROUND: Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAA/D) represents a 
potentially lethal disease group characterized by an increased risk of 
dissection or rupture. Only a small percentage (approximately 30%) of 
individuals with nonsyndromic familial TAA/D have a pathogenic variant in one of 
the genes that have been found to be associated with the disease.
METHODS: A targeted sequencing panel and direct sequencing approach were used to 
identify causative mutations in the index patients and other family members.
RESULTS: In this study we report two apparently unrelated Cypriot families with 
nonsyndromic familial TAA/D. The proband A is a female patient diagnosed with 
TAA/D and intracranial aneurysm and opted for an elective intervention. The 
proband B is a male patient who was diagnosed with TAA/D and underwent cardiac 
surgery. Sequencing analysis identified a novel splice site variant (c.871+1G>A) 
in SMAD3 which is shown to be associated with the disease. Analysis of mRNA from 
the patient's tissue confirmed aberrant splicing and exon 6 skipping.
CONCLUSION: Our findings expand the mutation spectrum of variants that have been 
shown to be associated with nonsyndromic familial TAA/D. This study demonstrates 
the importance of a comprehensive clinical and genetic evaluation aiming at 
early diagnosis and intervention.
