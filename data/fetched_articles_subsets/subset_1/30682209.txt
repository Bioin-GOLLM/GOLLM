PURPOSE: To investigate retinal structure in subjects with CNGA3-associated 
achromatopsia and evaluate disease symmetry and intrafamilial variability.
METHODS: Thirty-eight molecularly confirmed subjects underwent ocular 
examination, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and nonconfocal split-detection 
adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO). OCT scans were used for 
evaluating foveal hypoplasia, grading foveal ellipsoid zone (EZ) disruption, and 
measuring outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness. AOSLO images were used to 
quantify peak foveal cone density, intercell distance (ICD), and the coefficient 
of variation (CV) of ICD.
RESULTS: Mean (±SD) age was 25.9 (±13.1) years. Mean (± SD) best corrected 
visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.87 (±0.14) logarithm of the minimum angle of 
resolution. Examination with OCT showed variable disruption or loss of the EZ. 
Seven subjects were evaluated for disease symmetry, with peak foveal cone 
density, ICD, CV, ONL thickness, and BCVA not differing significantly between 
eyes. A cross-sectional evaluation of AOSLO imaging showed a mean (±SD) peak 
foveal cone density of 19,844 (±13,046) cones/mm2. There was a weak negative 
association between age and peak foveal cone density (r = -0.397, P = 0.102), as 
well as between EZ grade and age (P = 0.086).
CONCLUSIONS: The remnant cone mosaics were irregular and variably disrupted, 
with significantly lower peak foveal cone density than unaffected individuals. 
Variability was also seen among subjects with identical mutations. Therefore, 
subjects should be considered on an individual basis for stratification in 
clinical trials. Interocular symmetry suggests that both eyes have comparable 
therapeutic potential and the fellow eye can serve as a valid control. 
Longitudinal studies are needed, to further examine the weak negative 
association between age and foveal cone structure observed here.
