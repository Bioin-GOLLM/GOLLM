This review summarizes the biology of the proton-coupled folate transporter 
(PCFT). PCFT was identified in 2006 as the primary transporter for intestinal 
absorption of dietary folates, as mutations in PCFT are causal in hereditary 
folate malabsorption (HFM) syndrome. Since 2006, there have been major advances 
in understanding the mechanistic roles of critical amino acids and/or domains in 
the PCFT protein, many of which were identified as mutated in HFM patients, and 
in characterizing transcriptional control of the human PCFT gene. With the 
recognition that PCFT is abundantly expressed in human tumors and is active at 
pHs characterizing the tumor microenvironment, attention turned to exploiting 
PCFT for delivering novel cytotoxic antifolates for solid tumors. The finding 
that pemetrexed is an excellent PCFT substrate explains its demonstrated 
clinical efficacy for mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer, and prompted 
development of more PCFT-selective tumor-targeted 6-substituted 
pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates that derive their cytotoxic effects by 
targeting de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis.
