Black fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable 
polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at 
the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of 
extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer 
space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, 
are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting 
black fungus Knufia chersonesos (Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were 
exposed to simulated microgravity-one of the prevalent features characterizing 
space conditions-by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). 
Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia 
and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell 
physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to 
ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. 
Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and 
lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation 
via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant 
activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for 
the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of 
dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the 
secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in 
protein modulation were observed between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, with several 
proteins being downregulated under LSSMG in the Mut when compared to the Wt. 
Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to 
LSSMG. Similarly, the strains' survivability was not negatively affected. This 
study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in 
black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions.
