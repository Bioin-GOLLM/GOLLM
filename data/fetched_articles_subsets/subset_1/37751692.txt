Achieving nanometer-scale resolution remains challenging in expansion microscopy 
due to photon loss. To address this concern, here we develop a multi-color 
expansion stimulated emission depletion technique based on small-molecule probes 
to realize high labeling density and intensity. Our method substantially lowers 
the barrier to visualizing diverse intracellular proteins and their interactions 
in three dimensions. It enables us to achieve sub-10-nm resolution in structures 
such as microfilaments, lysosomes, and mitochondria, providing new insights into 
cell biology.
