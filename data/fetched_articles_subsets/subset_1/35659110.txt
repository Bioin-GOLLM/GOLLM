BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance in companion animals poses significant risks to 
animal and human health. Prolonged antimicrobial drug (AMD) treatment in animals 
is a potential source of selection pressure for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) 
including in the gastrointestinal microbiota. We performed a prospective study 
of dogs treated for septic peritonitis, pyometra, or bacterial pneumonia and 
collected repeated fecal samples over 60 days. Bacterial cultures and direct 
molecular analyses of fecal samples were performed including targeted resistance 
gene profiling.
RESULTS: Resistant Escherichia coli increased after 1 week of treatment 
(D1:21.4% vs. D7:67.9% P < 0.001) and returned to baseline proportions by D60 
(D7:67.9% vs D60:42.9%, P = 0.04). Dogs with septic peritonitis were 
hospitalized significantly longer than those with pneumonia or pyometra. Based 
on genetic analysis, Simpson's diversity index significantly decreased after 
1 week of treatment (D1 to D7, P = 0.008), followed by a gradual increase to day 
60 (D1 and D60, P = 0.4). Detection of CTX-M was associated with phenotypic 
resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in E. coli (OR 12.1, 3.3-68.0, 
P < 0.001). Lincosamide and macrolide-resistance genes were more frequently 
recovered on days 14 and 28 compared to day 1 (P = 0.002 and P = 0.004 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: AMR was associated with prescribed drugs but also developed against 
AMDs not administered during the study. Companion animals may be reservoirs of 
zoonotic multidrug resistant pathogens, suggesting that veterinary AMD 
stewardship and surveillance efforts should be prioritized.
