Although canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV) are 
important enteric pathogens of dogs and have been studied extensively in 
different parts of the world, there are no reports on these viruses from the 
Caribbean region. During 2015-2016, a total of 104 diarrheic fecal samples were 
collected from puppies and adult dogs, with or without hemorrhagic 
gastroenteritis, on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts (KNA). By PCR, 25 (24%, 
n=104) samples tested positive for CPV. Based on analysis of the complete 
deduced VP2 amino acid sequences, 20 of the KNA CPV strains were assigned to new 
CPV-2a (also designated as CPV-2a-297A). On the other hand, the VP2 genes of the 
remaining 5 strains were partially characterized, or could not be sequenced. New 
CPV-2a was the predominant CPV variant in St. Kitts, contrasting the molecular 
epidemiology of CPV variants reported in most studies from nearby North and 
South American countries. By RT-PCR, CCoVs were detected in 5 samples (4.8%, 
n=104). Based on analysis of partial M-protein gene, the KNA CCoV strains were 
assigned to CCoV-I genotype, and were closely related to CCoV-I strains from 
Brazil. To our knowledge, this is the first report on detection and genetic 
diversity of CPV and CCoV in dogs from the Caribbean region, and underscores the 
importance of similar studies in the other Caribbean islands.
