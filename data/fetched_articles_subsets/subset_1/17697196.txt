Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency that 
typically affects adults and is characterized by abnormalities of quantative and 
qualitative humoral function that are heterogeneous in their immunological 
profile and clinical manifestations. The recent identification of four monogenic 
defects that result in the CVID phenotype also demonstrates that the genetic 
basis of CVID is highly variable. Mutations in the genes encoding the tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily receptors transmembrane activator and 
calcium-modulating ligand interactor (TACI) and B cell activation factor of the 
TNF family receptor (BAFF-R), CD19 and the co-stimulatory molecule inducible 
co-stimulator molecule (ICOS) all lead to CVID and illustrate the complex 
interplay required to co-ordinate an effective humoral immune response. The 
molecular mechanisms leading to the immune defect are still not understood 
clearly and particularly in the case of TACI, where a number of heterozygous 
mutations have been found in affected individuals, the molecular pathogenesis of 
disease requires further elucidation. Together these defects account for perhaps 
10-15% of all cases of CVID and it is highly likely that further genetic defects 
will be identified.
