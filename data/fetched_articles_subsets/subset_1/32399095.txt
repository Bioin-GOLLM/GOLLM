INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, China and 
other parts of the world affects people and spreads coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) through human-to-human contact, with a mortality rate of > 2%. There 
are no approved drugs or vaccines yet available against SARS-CoV-2.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: State-of-the-art tools based on in-silico methods are a 
cost-effective initial approach for identifying appropriate ligands against 
SARS-CoV-2. The present study developed the 3D structure of the envelope and 
nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular docking analysis was 
done against various ligands.
RESULTS: The highest log octanol/water partition coefficient, high number of 
hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, lowest non-bonded interaction energy between 
the receptor and the ligand, and high binding affinity were considered for the 
best ligand for the envelope (mycophenolic acid: log P = 3.00; DG = -10.2567 
kcal/mol; pKi = 7.713 µM) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein 
(1-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid: log P = 2.901; DG 
= -12.2112 kcal/mol; pKi = 7.885 µM) of SARS-CoV-2.
CONCLUSIONS: The study identifies the most potent compounds against the 
SARS-CoV-2 envelope and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein through state-of-the-art 
tools based on an in-silico approach. A combination of these two ligands could 
be the best option to consider for further detailed studies to develop a drug 
for treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19.
