BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pouchitis, the most common complication after 
proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis, 
has been attributed to altered composition of faecal flora. We investigated the 
role of antimicrobial and antiglycan antibodies and polymorphisms in microbial 
pattern recognition receptor genes.
METHODS: Clinical charts of all 184 patients with ulcerative colitis who 
underwent IPAA between 1990-2004 were reviewed for pre- and post-operative 
disease course.
RESULTS: Follow-up data were available in 172 patients [67 female, median age at 
proctocolectomy 39.1Â years]. During a median follow-up of 6.7 (interquartile 
range 3.7-10.5) years, 80 patients (47%) developed at least one episode of 
pouchitis. Cox proportional-hazard regression identified extra-intestinal 
manifestations [HR 1.78 (95%CI 1.10-2.88), p=0.020], a GT/TT genotype at 
Toll-like-receptor-1 S87I [HR 1.64 (1.01-2.66), p=0.047], anti-chitobioside 
carbohydrate antibodies [HR 2.03 (1.11-3.70), p=0.021] and young age at 
diagnosis [p=0.003] to be independently associated with pouchitis. Factors 
associated with chronic pouchitis, diagnosed in 33 patients (19%), were 
extra-intestinal manifestations [HR 2.45 (1.07-5.62), p=0.034], backwash ileitis 
[HR 3.15 (1.10-9.00), p=0.032], outer-membrane porin antibodies [HR 2.67 
(1.20-5.94), p=0.016] and young age at proctocolectomy [p=0.008].
CONCLUSIONS: : The reported association with antibodies and Toll-like-receptor-1 
supports the pathophysiological role of the faecal flora in the development of 
pouchitis.
