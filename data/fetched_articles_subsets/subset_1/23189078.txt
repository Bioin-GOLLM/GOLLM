Interactions between killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their 
HLA-A, -B, and -C ligands diversify the functions of human natural killer cells. 
Consequently, combinations of KIR and HLA genotypes affect resistance to 
infection and autoimmunity, success of reproduction and outcome of hematopoietic 
cell transplantation. HLA-C, with its C1 and C2 epitopes, evolved in hominids to 
be specialized KIR ligands. The system's foundation was the C1 epitope, with C2 
a later addition, by several million years. The human inhibitory receptor for C1 
is encoded by KIR2DL2/3, a gene having two divergent allelic lineages: KIR2DL2 
is a B KIR haplotype component and KIR2DL3 an A KIR haplotype component. 
Although KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 exhibit quantitative differences in specificity and 
avidity for HLA-C, they qualitatively differ in their genetics, functional 
effect, and clinical influence. This is due to linkage disequilibrium between 
KIR2DL2 and KIR2DS2, a closely related activating receptor that was selected for 
lost recognition of HLA-C.
