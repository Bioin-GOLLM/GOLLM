Acute exercise is known to induce oxidative stress. Here we assessed the effects 
of gene polymorphisms SOD2 A16V, CAT -844 G>A, and GPx-1 rs1800668 C>T on 
oxidative stress markers in 28 elite water polo male players prior to and after 
a routinely programmed friendly match. The mean plasma concentrations of 
derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs), as well as lactic 
dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, creatine kinase (CK) activity, CK-MB, and 
myoglobin, were significantly increased after exercise, while blood antioxidant 
potential (BAP) and total free thiols were significantly decreased, compared 
with those measured before exercise. Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) 
were also increased after exercise but not significantly. We observed that water 
polo players having either AV16 or VV16 SOD genotype exhibited a significant 
increase of postexercise AOPP, LDH, CK, and myoglobin plasma levels in 
comparison with wild-type athletes. Water polo players having either CAT -844 GA 
or GPx1 CT genotype showed a significant increase of postexercise dROMs plasma 
levels and, respectively, GPx and CAT enzyme activities in comparison with 
wild-type subjects. These preliminary results suggest that the screening for 
gene variants of antioxidant enzymes could be useful to assess individual 
susceptibility to oxidative stress and muscle damage in water polo players.
