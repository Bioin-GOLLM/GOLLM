Before the introduction of vaccines, group A rotaviruses (RVA) were the leading 
cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. The National Rotavirus 
Strain Surveillance System (NRSSS) was established in 1996 by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to perform passive RVA surveillance in the 
USA. We report the distribution of RVA genotypes collected through NRSSS during 
the 2009-2016 RVA seasons and retrospectively examine the genotypes detected 
through the NRSSS since 1996. During the 2009-2016 RVA seasons, 2134 
RVA-positive fecal specimens were sent to the CDC for analysis of the VP7 and 
VP4 genes by RT-PCR genotyping assays and sequencing. During 2009-2011, RVA 
genotype G3P[8] dominated, while G12P[8] was the dominant genotype during 
2012-2016. Vaccine strains were detected in 1.7% of specimens and 
uncommon/unusual strains, including equine-like G3P[8] strains, were found in 
1.9%. Phylogenetic analyses showed limited VP7 and VP4 sequence variation within 
the common genotypes with 1-3 alleles/lineages identified per genotype. A review 
of 20 years of NRSSS surveillance showed two changes in genotype dominance, from 
G1P[8] to G3P[8] and then G3P[8] to G12P[8]. A better understanding of the 
long-term effects of vaccine use on epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of 
circulating RVA strains requires continued surveillance.
