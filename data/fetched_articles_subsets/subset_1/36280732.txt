Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and its sequelae are growing health problems. We 
performed a genome-wide association study of NAFL, cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma, and integrated the findings with expression and proteomic data. For 
NAFL, we utilized 9,491 clinical cases and proton density fat fraction extracted 
from 36,116 liver magnetic resonance images. We identified 18 sequence variants 
associated with NAFL and 4 with cirrhosis, and found rare, protective, predicted 
loss-of-function variants in MTARC1 and GPAM, underscoring them as potential 
drug targets. We leveraged messenger RNA expression, splicing and predicted 
coding effects to identify 16 putative causal genes, of which many are 
implicated in lipid metabolism. We analyzed levels of 4,907 plasma proteins in 
35,559 Icelanders and 1,459 proteins in 47,151 UK Biobank participants, 
identifying multiple proteins involved in disease pathogenesis. We show that 
proteomics can discriminate between NAFL and cirrhosis. The present study 
provides insights into the development of noninvasive evaluation of NAFL and new 
therapeutic options.
