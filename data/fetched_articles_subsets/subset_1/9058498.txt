A point mutation (FV:R506Q) in the human coagulation factor V gene is associated 
with resistance to activated protein C and life-long increased risk of venous 
thrombosis. The mutation is common in populations of Caucasian origin but 
virtually absent among other populations. In this study of 140 healthy Swedish 
volunteers and 110 homozygotes for the FV:R506Q mutation, we determined the 
allele frequencies of the FV:R506Q mutation and four other dimorphisms, C/T at 
nucleotide positions 2298 and 2325, and A/G at nucleotide positions 2379 and 
2391. Manifest linkage disequilibrium was found between the FV:R506Q mutation 
and the four different dimorphisms. The finding of a single FV:R506Q haplotype 
in all homozygotes constitutes strong evidence of a common ancestor of Swedish 
individuals with the FV:R506Q mutation.
