Treatment options for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer are limited. 
Dysregulation of the immune system plays an important role in the pathogenesis 
of biliary tract cancer (BTC). This study aimed to investigate whether 
tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) 
inhibitor, could be combined safely with microwave ablation to enhance the 
effect of anti-CTLA4 treatment in patients with advanced BTC. Patients were 
enrolled to receive monthly tremelimumab (10 mg/kg, intravenously) for six 
doses, followed by infusions every 3 months until off-treatment criteria were 
met. Thirty-six days after the first tremelimumab dose, patients underwent 
subtotal microwave ablation. Interval imaging studies were performed every 8 
weeks. Adverse events (AEs) were noted and managed. Tumor and peripheral blood 
samples were collected to perform immune monitoring and whole-exome sequencing 
(WES). Twenty patients with refractory BTC were enrolled (median age, 56.5 
years). No dose-limiting toxicities were encountered. The common 
treatment-related AEs included lymphopenia, diarrhea, and elevated 
transaminases. Among 16 patients evaluable for efficacy analysis, 2 (12.5%) 
patients achieved a confirmed partial response (lasting for 8.0 and 18.1 months, 
respectively) and 5 patients (31.3%) achieved stable disease. Median progression 
free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.4 months (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 2.5-5.2) and 6.0 months (95% CI, 3.8-8.8), respectively. 
Peripheral blood immune cell subset profiling showed increased circulating 
activated human leukocyte antigen, DR isotype ([HLA-DR] positive) CD8+ T cells. 
T-cell receptor (TCR)β screening showed tremelimumab expanded TCR repertoire, 
but not reaching statistical significance (P = 0.057). Conclusion: Tremelimumab 
in combination with tumor ablation is a potential treatment strategy for 
patients with advanced BTC. Increased circulating activated CD8+ T cells and TCR 
repertoire expansion induced by tremelimumab may contribute to treatment 
benefit.
