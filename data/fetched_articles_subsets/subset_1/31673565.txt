Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells show great promise in treating cancers 
and viral infections. However, most protocols developed to expand T cells 
require relatively long periods of time in culture, potentially leading to 
progression toward populations of terminally differentiated effector memory 
cells. Here, we describe in detail a 9-day protocol for CAR gene transduction 
and expansion of primary rhesus macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs). Cells produced and expanded with this method show high levels of 
viability, high levels of co-expression of two transduced genes, retention of 
the central memory phenotype, and sufficient quantity for immunotherapeutic 
infusion of 1-2 × 108 cells/kg in a 10 kg rhesus macaque. This 9-day protocol 
may be broadly used for CAR-T cell and other T cell immunotherapy approaches to 
decrease culture time and increase maintenance of central memory populations.
