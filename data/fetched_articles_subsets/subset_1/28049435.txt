BACKGROUND: Detection of DNA mutations at very low allele fractions with high 
accuracy will significantly improve the effectiveness of precision medicine for 
cancer patients. To achieve this goal through next generation sequencing, 
researchers need a detection method that 1) captures rare mutation-containing 
DNA fragments efficiently in the mix of abundant wild-type DNA; 2) sequences the 
DNA library extensively to deep coverage; and 3) distinguishes low level true 
variants from amplification and sequencing errors with high accuracy. Targeted 
enrichment using PCR primers provides researchers with a convenient way to 
achieve deep sequencing for a small, yet most relevant region using benchtop 
sequencers. Molecular barcoding (or indexing) provides a unique solution for 
reducing sequencing artifacts analytically. Although different molecular 
barcoding schemes have been reported in recent literature, most variant calling 
has been done on limited targets, using simple custom scripts. The analytical 
performance of barcode-aware variant calling can be significantly improved by 
incorporating advanced statistical models.
RESULTS: We present here a highly efficient, simple and scalable enrichment 
protocol that integrates molecular barcodes in multiplex PCR amplification. In 
addition, we developed smCounter, an open source, generic, barcode-aware variant 
caller based on a Bayesian probabilistic model. smCounter was optimized and 
benchmarked on two independent read sets with SNVs and indels at 5 and 1% allele 
fractions. Variants were called with very good sensitivity and specificity 
within coding regions.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that we can accurately detect somatic mutations 
with allele fractions as low as 1% in coding regions using our enrichment 
protocol and variant caller.
