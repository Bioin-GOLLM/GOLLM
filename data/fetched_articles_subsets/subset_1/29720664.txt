In eukaryotic cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest continuous 
membrane-enclosed network which surrounds a single lumen. Using a new 
genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI), we applied the patch clamp 
technique to cultured HEK293 cells and neurons and found that there is a very 
fast electrical interaction between the plasma membrane and internal 
membrane(s). This discovery suggests a novel mechanism for interaction between 
the external membrane and internal membranes as well as mechanisms for 
interactions between the various internal membranes. The ER may transfer 
electrical signals between the plasma membrane and other internal organelles. 
The internal membrane optical signal is reversed in polarity but has a time 
course similar to that of the plasma membrane signal. The optical signal of the 
GEVI in the plasma membrane is consistent from trial to trial. However, the 
internal signal decreases in size with repeated trials suggesting that the 
electrical coupling is degrading and/or the resistance of the internal membrane 
is decaying.
