BACKGROUND: In view of the limited data on radiotherapy (RT) combined with 
immunotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), 
this study aimed to identify the immune activation effect on different sites and 
the survival outcomes of radioimmunotherapy at different treatment stages.
METHODS: Forty-five patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC were included in this 
retrospective analysis. We collected the overall survival (OS) of the patients,, 
recorded the blood cell counts before, during, and after RT, and derived blood 
index ratios such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index 
(SII). The datasets were analyzed using the Spearman rank correlation test, 
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among the selected blood indices, the delta-NLR/PLR/Sll correlated with 
different irradiated organs, and the mean ranks of these three indices were the 
lowest in the brain-irradiated group during immunotherapy. Additionally, adjunct 
first-line immunotherapy with RT demonstrated a significant improvement compared 
to second- or third-line therapy and subsequent therapies.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that compared to other organs, the strongest 
immune activation effect occurs with brain RT, and ES-SCLC patients who received 
radioimmunotherapy (RIT) earlier achieved higher OS rates.
