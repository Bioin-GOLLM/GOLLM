Intracranial haemorrhages, including intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), 
intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), are 
leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In addition, haemorrhage 
contributes to tissue damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). To date, efforts 
to treat the long-term consequences of cerebral haemorrhage have been 
unsatisfactory. Incident rates and mortality have not showed significant 
improvement in recent years. In terms of secondary damage following haemorrhage, 
it is becoming increasingly apparent that blood components are of integral 
importance, with haemoglobin-derived iron playing a major role. However, the 
damage caused by iron is complex and varied, and therefore, increased 
investigation into the mechanisms by which iron causes brain injury is required. 
As ICH, IVH, SAH and TBI are related, this review will discuss the role of iron 
in each, so that similarities in injury pathologies can be more easily 
identified. It summarises important components of normal brain iron homeostasis 
and analyses the existing evidence on iron-related brain injury mechanisms. It 
further discusses treatment options of particular promise.
