Insulin signaling is mediated via a network of protein phosphorylation. 
Dysregulation of this network is central to obesity, type 2 diabetes and 
metabolic syndrome. Here we investigate the role of phosphatase binding protein 
Alpha4 (α4) that is essential for the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A 
(PP2A) in insulin action/resistance in adipocytes. Unexpectedly, 
adipocyte-specific inactivation of α4 impairs insulin-induced Akt-mediated 
serine/threonine phosphorylation despite a decrease in the protein phosphatase 
2A (PP2A) levels. Interestingly, loss of α4 also reduces insulin-induced insulin 
receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. This occurs through decreased association of 
α4 with Y-box protein 1, resulting in the enhancement of the tyrosine 
phosphatase protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) expression. Moreover, 
adipocyte-specific knockout of α4 in male mice results in impaired adipogenesis 
and altered mitochondrial oxidation leading to increased inflammation, systemic 
insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis, islet hyperplasia, and impaired 
thermogenesis. Thus, the α4 /Y-box protein 1(YBX1)-mediated pathway of insulin 
receptor signaling is involved in maintaining insulin sensitivity, normal 
adipose tissue homeostasis and systemic metabolism.
