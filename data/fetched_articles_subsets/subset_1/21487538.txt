AIM: To investigate the association between the programmed death-1(PD-1) 
polymorphisms and genetic susceptibility of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
infection in Chinese patients.
METHODS: Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), PD-1.1 G > A and PD-1.2 G > 
A, were genotyped in 539 patients with chronic HBV infection and 353 other 
family members (HbsAg-) from 256 nuclear families using polymerase chain 
reactiorestriction fragment length polymorphisms assay. The associations between 
PD-1 polymorphisms and genetic susceptibility of chronic HBV infection were 
analyzed usng the family-based association analysis method.
RESULTS: No association or linkage was detected among 539 patients. Univariate 
(single-marker) family-based association tests demonstrated that PD-1 genotypes, 
alleles and transmitted haplotypes are not associated with chronic HBV infection 
(all with P value more than 0.05). Transmission/disequilibrium test and sibship 
disequilibrium test analysis showed no excess of the alleles from heterozygous 
parents to affected offspring (P = 0.688880, P = 1.000000 respectively).
CONCLUSION: The data demonstrated that PD-1.1 and PD-1.2 polymorphisms are not 
associated with chronic HBV infection in Chinese patients.
