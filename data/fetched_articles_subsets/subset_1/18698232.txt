OBJECTIVES: The 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor, a ligand-gated ion 
channel, is known to be involved in gut motility and peristalsis, the mediation 
of pain and psychiatric diseases. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are effectively 
used to treat chemotherapy-induced emesis and irritable bowel syndrome. We have 
characterized the impact of four naturally occurring variants in the HTR3B gene 
leading to amino acid exchanges within the respective subunit of heteromeric 
5-HT3A/B receptors on a functional and expressional level.
METHODS AND RESULTS: For functional characterization, a Ca influx assay based on 
aequorin bioluminescence was used. Radioligand-binding studies with the 5-HT3 
receptor antagonist [H]GR65630 were carried out to determine expression levels 
of heteromeric 5-HT3A/B receptors. Transiently transfected human embryonic 
kidney 293 cells using 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B complementary DNA constructs were shown 
to coexpress homopentameric 5-HT3A next to heteromeric 5-HT3A/B receptors. The 
variant p.V183I decreased surface expression, whereas p.Y129S and p.S156R led to 
pronounced increases of 5-HT maximum responses, despite nearly unaltered surface 
expression levels of heteromeric 5-HT3A/B receptors.
CONCLUSION: These results may help to explain earlier reported association 
findings of the frequent p.Y129S and p.V183I variants with psychiatric diseases. 
Replication studies with larger sample pools, especially regarding the rare 
p.S156R variant would be useful, to obtain an idea about the predisposing role 
of these single nucleotide polymorphisms as susceptibility variants.
