Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, the rpsLd gene was amplified 
and cloned, which encodes the streptomycin-dependent (Smd) mutant of ribosomal 
protein S12 in E.coli T83. The result of DNA sequencing showed an AAA to CAA 
mutation at codon 42, leading to the substitution of glutamine (Gln, Q) for 
lysine (Lys, K). According to the principle of Garnier, we predicted that there 
might be alterations in the secondary structural propensity of protein S12 due 
to the mutation. The outcome indicated that the beta-turn propensity at position 
42 and its nearby region was increased evidently and the relative position of 
relevant subdomains were changed. As a result, the special conformation of the 
whole protein S12 was influenced. In view of that ribosomal proteins and 
ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) mutually adapted in structures and functions, the probable 
molecular mechanism. That how protein S12 Smd mutant in E.coli T83 suppressed 
lambda N gene's expression is discussed.
