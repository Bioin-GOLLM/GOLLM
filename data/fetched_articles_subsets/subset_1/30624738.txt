Helicobacter pylori encodes a large number of restriction-modification (R-M) 
systems despite its small genome. R-M systems have been described as 'primitive 
immune systems' in bacteria, but the role of methylation in bacterial gene 
regulation and other processes is increasingly accepted. Every H. pylori strain 
harbours a unique set of R-M systems resulting in a highly diverse methylome. We 
identified a highly conserved GCGC-specific m5C MTase (JHP1050) that was 
predicted to be active in all of 459 H. pylori genome sequences analyzed. 
Transcriptome analysis of two H. pylori strains and their respective MTase 
mutants showed that inactivation of the MTase led to changes in the expression 
of 225 genes in strain J99, and 29 genes in strain BCM-300. Ten genes were 
differentially expressed in both mutated strains. Combining bioinformatic 
analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that motifs overlapping 
the promoter influence the expression of genes directly, while methylation of 
other motifs might cause secondary effects. Thus, m5C methylation modifies the 
transcription of multiple genes, affecting important phenotypic traits that 
include adherence to host cells, natural competence for DNA uptake, bacterial 
cell shape, and susceptibility to copper.
