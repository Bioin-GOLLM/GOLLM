INTRODUCTION: Polymeric nanoparticles are potential carriers for the efficient 
delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs due to their multifaceted 
applications. Docetaxel is relatively less hydrophobic and twice as potent as 
paclitaxel. Like other taxane chemotherapeutic agents, docetaxel is not well 
tolerated and shows toxicity in the patients. Nanoencapsulation of potent 
chemotherapeutic agents has been shown to improve tolerability and therapeutic 
outcome. Therefore, the present study was designed to fabricate chitosan and 
sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) based on ionically cross-linked nanoparticles for 
sustained release of docetaxel.
METHODS: Nanoparticles were prepared by the ionic-gelation method by dropwise 
addition of the STPP solution into the chitosan solution in different ratios. 
CNPs were characterized for post-formulation parameters like size, zeta 
potential, scanning electron microscope (SEM), FTIR, DSC/TGA, pXRD, and in-vitro 
drug release, as well as for acute oral toxicity studies in Wistar rats.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The optimized docetaxel loaded polymeric nanoparticles 
were in the size range (172.6nm-479.65 nm), and zeta potential (30.45-35.95 mV) 
required to achieve enhanced permeation and retention effect. In addition, 
scanning electron microscopy revealed rough and porous surface, whereas, FTIR 
revealed the compatible polymeric nanoparticles. Likewise, the thermal stability 
was ensured through DSC and TG analysis, and powder X-ray diffraction analysis 
exhibited solid-state stability of the docetaxel loaded nanoparticles. The 
in-vitro drug release evaluation in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) showed 
sustained release pattern, i.e. 51.57-69.93% within 24 hrs. The data were fitted 
to different release kinetic models which showed Fickian diffusion as a 
predominant release mechanism (R2 = 0.9734-0.9786, n= 0.264-0.340). Acceptable 
tolerability was exhibited by acute oral toxicity in rabbits and no abnormality 
was noted in growth, behavior, blood biochemistry or histology and function of 
vital organs.
CONCLUSION: Ionically cross-linked chitosan nanoparticles are non-toxic and 
biocompatible drug delivery systems for sustained release of chemotherapeutic 
agents, such as docetaxel.
