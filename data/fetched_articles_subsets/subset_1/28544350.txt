OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to determine the role of genetic variations 
within the zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A) gene, a candidate for a psychosis 
risk-conferring gene, in the development of schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar 
disorder (BP) in the Korean population.
METHODS: A total of 921 patients with SZ, bipolar I (BP-I) and II (BP-II) 
disorder, and 502 control subjects participated in the study. Twenty-one tag 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genomic region of ZNF804A and 
seven reference SNPs based on previous reports were genotyped. We applied 
logistic regression analyses under additive, dominant and recessive models.
RESULTS: Fifteen of the 28 SNPs showed a nominally significant association with 
at least one diagnostic group. However, none of these associations remained 
significant after false discovery rate (FDR) correction. As the trend of 
association was observed mostly in SZ and BP-I with similar patterns, we 
performed a post hoc analysis for the combined SZ and BP-I group. Five SNPs 
(rs2369595, rs6755404, rs10931156, rs12476147 and rs1366842) showed a 
significant association with an FDR-corrected P of <.05.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports a possible role of ZNF804A in the common 
susceptibility of major psychoses, and identified additional candidate variants 
of the gene in the Korean population.
