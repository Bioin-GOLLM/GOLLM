Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a transboundary viral disease of cattle that causes 
substantial economic loss globally. There is no specific treatment and subunit 
vaccine for this disease to date. Reports of the global spread of this disease 
are worrisome. We designed a multi-epitope protein using an immunoinformatics 
approach in this study. We analyzed the proteome of LSDV and found 32 
structural/surface proteins. Four of these 32 proteins were predicted as 
antigenic and non-homologous to bovine and highly conserved in 26 LSDV isolates. 
The predicted B-cell epitopes and CTL epitopes were stitched together with the 
help of an AAY linker leading to the formation of a multi-epitope protein. The 
in silico study revealed that the modeled subunit vaccine candidate and TLR4 
receptor interact with high affinity. This interaction was also found to be 
stable using a molecular dynamics simulation study. Our study demonstrates a 
leap towards developing a subunit vaccine against LSD.
