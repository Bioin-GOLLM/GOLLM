Caudal regression syndrome (CRS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by 
developmental abnormalities of caudal spinal segments. To date, the etiology of 
CRS is unclear; sporadic cases are strongly associated with maternal diabetes, 
while familiar recurrence is infrequent. We describe in detail the prenatal 
clinical and sonographic findings of a recently described hereditary caudal 
regression syndrome, in four fetuses reported to be homozygous for a mutation in 
the T (brachyury) gene. The syndrome occurred in three consanguineous, but 
unrelated families, originating from the same geographical area. All affected 
fetuses had persistence of the notochord in association with abnormal vertebral 
ossification, sacral agenesis, and bilateral clubfoot. These findings suggest 
that, in case of prenatal diagnosis of sacral agenesis, an advanced ultrasound 
examination should assess the vertebral ossification and the rare persistence of 
the notochord, in order to rule the involvement of the T gene.
