BACKGROUND: Coagulopathy in traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated 
with poor neurological outcomes and higher in-hospital mortality. In general 
principle of trauma management, hypothermia should be prevented as it directly 
worsens coagulopathy. Therefore, we examined the safety of mild therapeutic 
hypothermia (MTH) in patients with coagulopathy following severe TBI.
METHODS: We re-evaluated the brain hypothermia (B-HYPO) study data based on 
coagulopathy and compared the Glasgow Outcome Scale scores and survival rates at 
6 months using per protocol analyses. Coagulopathy was defined as an activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) > 60 s and/or fibrin/fibrinogen degradation 
product levels (FDP) > 90 μg/mL on admission. Baseline characteristics, 
coagulation parameters, and outcomes were compared between the control and MTH 
groups with or without coagulopathy.
RESULTS: In patients with coagulopathy, 12 patients were allocated to the 
control group (35.5-37.0 °C) and 20 patients to the MTH group (32-34 °C). In 
patients without coagulopathy, 28 were allocated to the control group and 59 
patients were allocated to the MTH group. In patients with coagulopathy, 
favorable neurological outcomes and survival rates were comparable between the 
control and MTH groups (33.3% vs. 35.0%, P = 1.00; 50.0% vs. 60.0%, P = 0.72) 
with no difference in complication rates. On admission, no significant 
differences in APTT or FDP levels were observed between the two groups; however, 
APTT was significantly prolonged in the MTH group compared to the control group 
on day 3.
DISCUSSION: Based on our study, MTH did not seem to negatively affect the 
outcomes in patients with coagulopathy following severe TBI on admission; 
therefore, the present study indicates that MTH may be applicable even in 
patients with severe TBI and coagulopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that in comparison to control, MTH does not 
worsen the outcome of patients with coagulopathy following severe TBI.
