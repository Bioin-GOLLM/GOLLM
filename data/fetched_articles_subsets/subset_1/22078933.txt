Dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity 
and diabetes, but the mechanism is unclear. Gain of function of the gene 
encoding deacetylase SirT1 improves insulin sensitivity and could be expected to 
protect against lipid abnormalities. Surprisingly, when transgenic mice 
overexpressing SirT1 (SirBACO) are placed on atherogenic diet, they maintain 
better glucose homeostasis, but develop worse lipid profiles and larger 
atherosclerotic lesions than controls. We show that transcription factor cAMP 
response element binding protein (Creb) is deacetylated in SirBACO mice. We 
identify Lys136 is a substrate for SirT1-dependent deacetylation that affects 
Creb activity by preventing its cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, leading to 
reduced expression of glucogenic genes and promoting hepatic lipid accumulation 
and secretion. Expression of constitutively acetylated Creb (K136Q) in SirBACO 
mice mimics Creb activation and abolishes the dyslipidemic and 
insulin-sensitizing effects of SirT1 gain of function. We propose that 
SirT1-dependent Creb deacetylation regulates the balance between glucose and 
lipid metabolism, integrating fasting signals.
