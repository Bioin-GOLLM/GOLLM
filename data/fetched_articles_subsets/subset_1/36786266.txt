BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a frequent 
comorbidity in severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA), which may contribute to the 
loss of asthma control. CRSwNP and SEA share a T2-mediated mechanism and the use 
of some anti-asthma monoclonal antibodies has recently been extended to CRSwNP. 
Unlike dupilumab and omalizumab, benralizumab approval for CRSwNP is ongoing. We 
aimed to evaluate the efficacy of benralizumab efficacy on SEA and on CRSwNP in 
patients affected by both pathologies in a real life setting.
METHODS: 17 patients affected by both SEA and CRSwNP participated to our study. 
At baseline (T0) and at one year after benralizumab initiation (T1), all 
participants underwent  spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), Asthma Control 
Test (ACT), nasal endoscopy with Nasal Polyp Score (NPS), nasal cytology and 
Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT 22).The continuous oral corticosteroid therapy 
(OCS), the number of year exacerbations and the need for sinus surgery were also 
evaluated  for each patient.
RESULTS: At T1, a marked reduction of SNOT-22, NPS, nasal eosinophils and 
neutrophils count were shown compared to T0. Moreover, at T1 ACT was 
significantly increased and FeNO, exacerbations/year and mean OCS dosage were 
significantly reduced compared to T0.
CONCLUSIONS: Our real-life study demonstrates the efficacy of benralizumab not 
only on SEA but also on nasal cytology and on nasal polyposis, confirming that 
patients affected by both SEA and CRSwNP may receive a considerable benefit from 
anti-IL5 receptor, treating both the comorbidities at once.
