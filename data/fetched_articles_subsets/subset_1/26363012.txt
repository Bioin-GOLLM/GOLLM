Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is mutated in various types of human cancer to 
IDH1(R132H), a structural alteration that leads to catalysis of α-ketoglutarate 
to the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate. In this study, we present evidence 
that small-molecule inhibitors of IDH1(R132H) that are being developed for 
cancer therapy may pose risks with coadministration of radiotherapy. Cancer 
cells heterozygous for the IDH1(R132H) mutation exhibited less IDH-mediated 
production of NADPH, such that after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), there 
were higher levels of reactive oxygen species, DNA double-strand breaks, and 
cell death compared with IDH1 wild-type cells. These effects were reversed by 
the IDH1(R132H) inhibitor AGI-5198. Exposure of IDH1 wild-type cells to 
D-2-hydroxyglutarate was sufficient to reduce IDH-mediated NADPH production and 
increase IR sensitivity. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the 
radiosensitivity of heterozygous cells was independent of the well-described DNA 
hypermethylation phenotype in IDH1-mutated cancers. Thus, our results argue that 
altered oxidative stress responses are a plausible mechanism to understand the 
radiosensitivity of IDH1-mutated cancer cells. Further, they offer an 
explanation for the relatively longer survival of patients with IDH1-mutated 
tumors, and they imply that administration of IDH1(R132H) inhibitors in these 
patients may limit irradiation efficacy in this setting.
