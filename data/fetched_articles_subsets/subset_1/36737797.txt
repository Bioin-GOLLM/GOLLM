BACKGROUND: Many laboratories have described the in vitro isolation of 
multipotent cells with stem cell properties from the skin of various species 
termed skin-derived stem cells (SDSCs). However, the cellular origin of these 
cells and their capability to give rise, among various cell types, to male germ 
cells, remain largely unexplored.
METHODS: SDSCs were isolated from newborn mice skin, and then differentiated 
into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) in vitro. Single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) was then applied to dissect the cellular origin of SDSCs 
using cells isolated from newborn mouse skin and SDSC colonies. Based on an 
optimized culture strategy, we successfully generated spermatogonial stem 
cell-like cells (SSCLCs) in vitro.
RESULTS: Here, using scRNA-seq and analyzing the profile of 7543 single-cell 
transcriptomes from newborn mouse skin and SDSCs, we discovered that they mainly 
consist of multipotent papillary dermal fibroblast progenitors (pDFPs) residing 
in the dermal layer. Moreover, we found that epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
signaling is pivotal for the capability of these progenitors to proliferate and 
form large colonies in vitro. Finally, we optimized the protocol to efficiently 
generate PGCLCs from SDSCs. Furthermore, PGCLCs were induced into SSCLCs and 
these SSCLCs showed meiotic potential when cultured with testicular organoids.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings here identify pDFPs as SDSCs derived from newborn skin 
and show for the first time that such precursors can be induced to generate 
cells of the male germline.
