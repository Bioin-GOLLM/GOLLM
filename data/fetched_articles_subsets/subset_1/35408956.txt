The liver is one of the richest organs in mitochondria, serving as a hub for key 
metabolic pathways such as Î²-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, 
ketogenesis, respiratory activity, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, 
all of which provide metabolic energy for the entire body. Mitochondrial 
dysfunction has been linked to subcellular organelle dysfunction in liver 
diseases, particularly fatty liver disease. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy 
(AFLP) is a life-threatening liver disorder unique to pregnancy, which can 
result in serious maternal and fetal complications, including death. Pregnant 
mothers with this disease require early detection, prompt delivery, and 
supportive maternal care. AFLP was considered a mysterious illness and though 
its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, molecular research over the past 
two decades has linked AFLP to mitochondrial dysfunction and defects in fetal 
fatty-acid oxidation (FAO). Due to deficient placental and fetal FAO, harmful 
3-hydroxy fatty acid metabolites accumulate in the maternal circulation, causing 
oxidative stress and microvesicular fatty infiltration of the liver, resulting 
in AFLP. In this review, we provide an overview of AFLP and mitochondrial FAO 
followed by discussion of how altered mitochondrial function plays an important 
role in the pathogenesis of AFLP.
