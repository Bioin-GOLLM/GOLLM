ISG15 is an ubiquitin-like modifier that is associated with reduced survival 
rates in breast cancer patients. The mechanism by which ISG15 achieves this 
however remains elusive. We demonstrate that modification of Rab 
GDP-Dissociation Inhibitor Beta (GDI2) by ISG15 (ISGylation) alters endocytic 
recycling of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in non-interferon stimulated cells using 
CRISPR-knock out models for ISGylation. By regulating EGFR trafficking, 
ISGylation enhances EGFR recycling and sustains Akt-signalling. We further show 
that Akt signalling positively correlates with levels of ISG15 and its E2-ligase 
in basal breast cancer cohorts, confirming the link between ISGylation and Akt 
signalling in human tumours. Persistent and enhanced Akt activation explains the 
more aggressive tumour behaviour observed in human breast cancers. We show that 
ISGylation can act as a driver of tumour progression rather than merely being a 
bystander.
