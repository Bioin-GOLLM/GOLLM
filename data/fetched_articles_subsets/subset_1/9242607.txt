Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized 
by the widespread development of distinctive tumors termed hamartomas. 
TSC-determining loci have been mapped to chromosomes 9q34 (TSC1) and 16p13 
(TSC2). The TSC1 gene was identified from a 900-kilobase region containing at 
least 30 genes. The 8.6-kilobase TSC1 transcript is widely expressed and encodes 
a protein of 130 kilodaltons (hamartin) that has homology to a putative yeast 
protein of unknown function. Thirty-two distinct mutations were identified in 
TSC1, 30 of which were truncating, and a single mutation (2105delAAAG) was seen 
in six apparently unrelated patients. In one of these six, a somatic mutation in 
the wild-type allele was found in a TSC-associated renal carcinoma, which 
suggests that hamartin acts as a tumor suppressor.
