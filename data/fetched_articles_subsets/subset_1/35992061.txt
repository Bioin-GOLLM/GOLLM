Optical visualization of complex microstructures in the entire organ is 
essential for biomedical research. However, the existing methods fail to 
accurately acquire the detailed microstructures of whole organs with good 
morphological and biochemical preservation. This study proposes a 
cryo-fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (cryo-fMOST) to image 
whole organs in three dimensions (3D) with submicron resolution. The system 
comprises a line-illumination microscope module, cryo-microtome, three-stage 
refrigeration module, and heat insulation device. To demonstrate the imaging 
capacity and wide applicability of the system, we imaged and reconstructed 
various organs of mice in 3D, including the healthy tongue, kidney, and brain, 
as well as the infarcted heart. More importantly, imaged brain slices were 
performed sugar phosphates determination and fluorescence in situ hybridization 
imaging to verify the compatibility of multi-omics measurements. The results 
demonstrated that cryo-fMOST is capable of acquiring high-resolution 
morphological details of various whole organs and may be potentially useful for 
spatial multi-omics.
