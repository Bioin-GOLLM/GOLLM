AIMS: The heritability of aerobic power and of the response to physical training 
has been shown in healthy subjects. beta(1)-Adrenergic receptor (beta(1)AR) 
function affects exercise performance. This study aims to investigate whether 
the Ser49Gly and Gly389Arg polymorphisms of the beta(1)AR gene or their 
haplotypes are associated with aerobic power or its response to physical 
training in coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Nine hundred and thirty-five biologically unrelated 
Caucasian patients with CAD who had exercised until exhaustion during graded 
bicycle testing at baseline and after completion of 3 months of exercise 
training from 1990 to 2001 (n = 1095) were eligible for inclusion in the 
CAREGENE (CArdiac REhabilitation and GENetics of Exercise performance) study. 
Polymorphisms were detected using the invader assay (Third Wave 
Technologiestrade mark, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). Patients with the Gly49Gly 
genotype had significantly higher covariate-adjusted aerobic power at baseline 
than those with Ser49Ser and Ser49Gly (P < 0.05). Adjusted aerobic power at 
baseline was highest in the Ser49-Gly389/Gly49-Gly389 and 
Gly49-Arg389/Gly49-Arg389 haplotype combinations. Aerobic power increased 
significantly (P < 0.001) with physical training. There was no association with 
the effect of physical training.
CONCLUSION: Ser49Gly and haplotype combinations of Ser49Gly and Gly389Arg of the 
beta(1)AR gene are associated with aerobic power, but not with the response to 
physical training in patients with CAD included in the CAREGENE study.
