Cells that are deficient in homologous recombination, such as those that lack 
functional breast cancer-associated 1 (BRCA1) or BRCA2, are hypersensitive to 
inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). However, BRCA-deficient tumors 
represent only a small fraction of adult cancers, which might restrict the 
therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitor monotherapy. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 
(Cdk1) phosphorylates BRCA1, and this is essential for efficient formation of 
BRCA1 foci. Here we show that depletion or inhibition of Cdk1 compromises the 
ability of cells to repair DNA by homologous recombination. Combined inhibition 
of Cdk1 and PARP in BRCA-wild-type cancer cells resulted in reduced colony 
formation, delayed growth of human tumor xenografts and tumor regression with 
prolonged survival in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Inhibition of Cdk1 
did not sensitize nontransformed cells or tissues to inhibition of PARP. Because 
reduced Cdk1 activity impaired BRCA1 function and consequently, repair by 
homologous recombination, inhibition of Cdk1 represents a plausible strategy for 
expanding the utility of PARP inhibitors to BRCA-proficient cancers.
