Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a rare primary immunodeficiency. 
Different genes are found to be associated with SCN, including ELA2, HAX1, WAS, 
GFI1, G-CSFR. Also, recently G6PC3 as a rare gene in SCN has been reported. 
Patients with G6PC3 often have cardiac and/or urogenital malformations. Two 
patients with persistent severe neutropenia, recurrent infections and maturation 
arrest at promyelocyte-myelocyte stage in their bone marrow were assessed in 
this study. Both patients showed structural heart disease and one of them also 
showed urogenital anomaly. Sequence analyses of G6PC3 in 2 patients revealed two 
different homozygous mutations, one in exon 6 (Asn 313 fs), and the other in 
exon 3 (Ser 139 Met), the latter is a new mutation which has not been reported 
in previous studies. It can be concluded that G6PC3 is one of the responsible 
gene for SCN in Iranian patients. Based on the results, a new mutation in G6PC3 
observed in one patient.
