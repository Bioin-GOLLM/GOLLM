associations].

[Article in Russian]

Pristupa LN, Kmyta VV, Savchenko OV.

The article provides modern information about the structure of glucocorticoid 
receptor gene and its isoforms, the most common variants of missens and allelic 
polymorphisms. The polymorphisms N363S, BclI, ER22/23EK and TthIIII were 
characterized. The relationship of these polymorphisms with physique and 
metabolic changes, cardiovascular system diseases as well as with sensitivity to 
glucocorticoids (GCS) was analyzed. It has been established that N363S and BclI 
polymorphisms are associated with hypersensitivity to corticosteroids and can be 
the predictors of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and polymorphisms ER22/23EK and 
TthIIII are associated with resistance to GC and favorable metabolic profile.
