Almost every death in young patients with an advanced skin tumor is caused by 
melanoma. Today, with the help of modern treatments, these patients survive 
longer or can even achieve a cure. Advanced stage melanoma is frequently related 
with poor prognosis and physicians still find this disease difficult to manage 
due to the absence of a lasting response to initial treatment regimens and the 
lack of randomized clinical trials in post immunotherapy/targeted molecular 
therapy settings. New therapeutic targets are emerging from preclinical data on 
the genetic profile of melanocytes and from the identification of molecular 
factors involved in the pathogenesis of malignant transformation. In the current 
paper, we present the diagnostic challenges, molecular biology and genetics of 
malignant melanoma, as well as the current therapeutic options for patients with 
this diagnosis.
