BACKGROUND: Platelet activation can lead to enhanced oxidative stress, 
inflammatory response, and endothelial dysfunction. To quantify the effects of 
platelet inhibition on endothelial function, we assessed platelet activity of 
healthy persons before and after clopidogrel administration and evaluated its 
effects on endothelial function. We hypothesized that clopidogrel, by 
attenuating platelet activity, would result in enhanced endothelial function.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Microcirculatory endothelial function was quantified by 
laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) mediated by thermal hyperemia (TH) and 
postocclusive reactive hyperemia, respectively, in 287 and 241 relatively 
healthy and homogenous Old Order Amish persons. LDF and platelet aggregation 
measures were obtained at baseline and after 7 days of clopidogrel 
administration. Our primary outcome was percentage change in post- versus 
preclopidogrel LDF measures. Preclopidogrel TH-LDF and platelet aggregation were 
higher in women than in men (P<0.001). Clopidogrel administration was associated 
with ≈2-fold higher percentage change in TH-LDF in participants with high versus 
low baseline platelet aggregation (39.4±10.1% versus 17.4±5.6%, P=0.03). 
Clopidogrel also increased absolute TH-LDF measures in persons with high 
platelet aggregation (1757±766 to 2154±1055, P=0.03), with a more prominent 
effect in women (1909±846 to 2518±1048, P=0.001). There was no evidence that 
clopidogrel influenced postocclusive reactive hyperemia LDF measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of clopidogrel in healthy persons with high 
baseline platelet aggregation results in improved TH-induced microcirculatory 
endothelial function. These data suggest that clopidogrel may have a beneficial 
effect on microcirculatory endothelial function, presumably through antiplatelet 
activity, and may confer additional vascular benefits.
