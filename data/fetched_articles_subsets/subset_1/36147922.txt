OBJECTIVE: In contrast to normal cells, in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
are maintained in redox equilibrium, cancer cells are characterized by ectopic 
ROS accumulation. Myoferlin, a newly identified oncogene, has been associated 
with tumor metastasis, intracellular ROS production, and energy metabolism. The 
mechanism by which myoferlin regulates gastric cancer cell migration and ROS 
accumulation has not been determined.
METHODS: Myoferlin expression, intracellular ROS levels, the ratios of reduced 
to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (NADPH/NADP+) and migratory ability were measured in gastric cancer 
cells in vitro and in the TCGA and GEO databases in silico.
RESULTS: Myoferlin was found to be more highly expressed in tumor than in normal 
tissues of gastric cancer patients, with higher expression of Myoferlin 
associated with shorter survival time. Myoferlin was associated with 
significantly higher intracellular ROS levels and enhanced migration of gastric 
cancer cells. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a potent inhibitor of ROS, inhibited 
Myoferlin-induced ROS accumulation and cell migration.
CONCLUSIONS: Myoferlin is a candidate prognostic biomarker for gastric cancer 
and plays an essential role in regulating redox equilibrium and gastric cancer 
cell migration. Myoferlin may also be a new target for treatment of patients 
with gastric cancer.
