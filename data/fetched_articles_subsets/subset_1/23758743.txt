Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are etiologically heterogeneous, with hundreds 
of rare, highly penetrant mutations and genomic imbalances involved, each 
contributing to a very small fraction of cases. In this issue of Molecular 
Autism, Soorya and colleagues evaluated 32 patients with Phelan-McDermid 
syndrome, caused by either deletion of 22q13.33 or SHANK3 mutations, using 
gold-standard diagnostic assessments and showed that 84% met criteria for ASD, 
including 75% meeting criteria for autism. This study and prior studies 
demonstrate that this syndrome appears to be one of the more penetrant causes of 
ASD. In this companion review, we show that in samples ascertained for ASD, 
SHANK3 haploinsufficiency is one of the more prevalent monogenic causes of ASD, 
explaining at least 0.5% of cases. We note that SHANK3 haploinsufficiency 
remains underdiagnosed in ASD and developmental delay, although with the 
increasingly widespread use of chromosomal microarray analysis and targeted 
sequencing of SHANK3, the number of cases is bound to rise.
