Asymmetric dimethylarginine is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis 
and a cardiovascular risk factor. Its regulation has been studied extensively in 
experimental models, but less in humans. We studied common single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding for enzymes involved in ADMA biosynthesis 
and metabolism, i.e., PRMT1, DDAH1, DDAH2, and AGXT2, and assessed their 
associations with blood ADMA concentration in 377 unselected humans. The minor 
allele of DDAH1 SNP rs233112 was significantly more frequent in individuals with 
ADMA in the highest tertile or in the highest quartile, as was the major allele 
of DDAH2 rs805304. A combined genotype comprising both SNPs showed a significant 
genotype-phenotype association, with increasing ADMA concentration by an 
increasing number of inactive alleles. SNPs in the AGXT2 and PRMT1 genes showed 
no significant associations with blood ADMA concentration. Our study provides 
comprehensive evidence that DDAH1 and DDAH2 are the major enzymes regulating 
blood ADMA concentration, whilst PRMT1 indirectly affects ADMA, and AGXT2 may 
act as a back-up enzyme in ADMA metabolism under pathophysiological conditions 
only.
