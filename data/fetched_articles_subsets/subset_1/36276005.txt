A series of neutral luminescent bis(phosphine) Cu(i) complexes of 
pyridyl-tetrazolate ligands (L1-L3) with the general formula [CuI(L n )(P^P)] 
(1-6) were synthesized, which have been well characterized by IR, UV/vis, CV, 1H 
NMR and 31P NMR. For comparison, an Ag(i) complex [AgI(L2)(PPh3)2] (7) was also 
synthesized. The crystal structures of 2 and 7 have been further determined by 
X-ray crystallography. All these Cu(i) compounds show bright luminescence in the 
solid state with photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) in the range of 25.8% 
to 85.0%. More interestingly, the Cu(i) complexes bearing an additional dangling 
aromatic ring on the diimine ligands exhibit enhanced luminescent performance in 
various solutions and their PLQYs are significantly higher than those of related 
Cu(i) complexes without steric protection. Compared with 1, the Cu(i) complexes 
with an additional dangling tetrazole moiety show a significant solvatochromic 
effect, which is uncommon for luminescent Cu(i) complexes. Moreover, 
[CuI(L2)(PPh3)2] (2) was further designed as an OLED material, which showed a 
high external quantum efficiency of 7.7%.
