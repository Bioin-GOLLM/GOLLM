1-Methyl-1'-(4-methyl-phen-yl)-2',3',5',6',7',7a'-hexa-hydro-1'H-dispiro-[piperidine-3,2'-pyrrolizine-3',3''-indoline]-4,2''-dione.

The title compound, C(26)H(29)N(3)O(2), crystallizes with two mol-ecules in the 
asymmetric unit, having C-H⋯O inter-actions between them and resulting in a 
dimer characterized by an R(2) (2)(11) motif. These dimers are linked into an 
ABABAB chain via N-H⋯O, N-H⋯N and C-H⋯O built edge-fused R(1) (2)(5) and R(2) 
(2)(7) motifs. This chain is linked to its inversion-related partner via N-H⋯O 
bonds with an R(2) (2)(8) motif and leads to a double chain extending along the 
b axis characterized by an R(6) (6)(36) motif across the inversion centres. The 
methyl group of the phenyl ring and the oxindole of mol-ecule A and B are 
involved in C-H⋯π inter-actions. One C atom of the pyrrolizine ring of mol-ecule 
A and its attached H atoms show positional disorder, the major and minor 
components being in the ratio 0.706 (7):0.294 (7).
