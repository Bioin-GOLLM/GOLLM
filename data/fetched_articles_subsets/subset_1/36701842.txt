PURPOSE: Mixed-lineage leukemia protein 4 (MLL4/KMT2D) is a histone 
methyltransferase, and its mutation has been reported to be associated with a 
poor prognosis in many cancers, including lung cancer. We investigated the 
function of MLL4 in lung carcinogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in A549 cells transfected with 
control siRNA or MLL4 siRNA was performed. Also, we used EdU incorporation 
assay, colony formation assays, growth curve analysis, transwell invasion 
assays, immunohistochemical staining, and in vivo bioluminescence assay to 
investigate the function of MLL4 in lung carcinogenesis.
RESULTS: We found that MLL4 expression was downregulated in non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and tended to 
decrease with disease stage progression. We analyzed the transcriptomes in 
control and MLL4- deficient cells using high-throughput RNA deep sequencing 
(RNA-seq) and identified a cohort of target genes, such as SOX2, ATF1, FOXP4, 
PIK3IP1, SIRT4, TENT5B, and LFNG, some of which are related to proliferation and 
metastasis. Our results showed that low expression of MLL4 promotes NSCLC cell 
proliferation and metastasis and is required for the maintenance of NSCLC stem 
cell properties.
CONCLUSION: Our findings identify an important role of MLL4 in lung 
carcinogenesis through transcriptional regulation of PIK3IP1, affecting the 
PI3K/AKT/SOX2 axis, and suggest that MLL4 could be a potential prognostic 
indicator and target for NSCLC therapy.
