We designed, synthesized and identified a novel nucleoside derivative, 
4'-C-cyano-7-deaza-7-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdFA), which exerts potent 
anti-HBV activity (IC50 ~26 nM) with favorable hepatocytotoxicity (CC50 ~56 μM). 
Southern blot analysis using wild-type HBV (HBVWT)-encoding-plasmid-transfected 
HepG2 cells revealed that CdFA efficiently suppresses the production of HBVWT 
(IC50 = 153.7 nM), entecavir (ETV)-resistant HBV carrying L180M/S202G/M204V 
substitutions (HBVETVR; IC50 = 373.2 nM), and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV)-resistant 
HBV carrying A181T/N236T substitutions (HBVADVR; IC50=192.6 nM), whereas ETV and 
ADV were less potent against HBVETVR and HBVADVR (IC50: >1,000 and 4,022.5 nM, 
respectively). Once-daily peroral administration of CdFA to human-liver-chimeric 
mice over 14 days (1 mg/kg/day) comparably blocked HBVWT and HBVETVR viremia by 
0.7 and 1.2 logs, respectively, without significant changes in body-weight or 
serum human-albumin levels, although ETV only slightly suppressed HBVETVR 
viremia (CdFA vs ETV; p = 0.032). Molecular modeling suggested that ETV-TP has 
good nonpolar interactions with HBVWT reverse transcriptase (RTWT)'s Met204 and 
Asp205, while CdFA-TP fails to interact with Met204, in line with the relatively 
inferior activity against HBVWT of CdFA compared to ETV (IC50: 0.026 versus 
0.003 nM). In contrast, the 4'-cyano of CdFA-TP forms good nonpolar contacts 
with RTWT's Leu180 and RTETVR's Met180, while ETV-TP loses interactions with 
RTETVR's Met180, explaining in part why ETV is less potent against HBVETVR than 
CdFA. The present results show that CdFA exerts potent activity against HBVWT, 
HBVETVR and HBVADVR with enhanced safety and that 7-deaza-7-fluoro modification 
confers potent activity against drug-resistant HBV variants and favorable 
safety, shedding light to further design more potent and safer anti-HBV 
nucleoside analogs.
