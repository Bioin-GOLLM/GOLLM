RATIONALE: Previously, we reported that common variants in precursor microRNA 
(pre-miRNA) sequences played a role in the prediction of non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) survival.
OBJECTIVES: To assess whether variants in the pre-miRNA flanking region can 
influence the clinical behavior of NSCLC.
METHODS: We conducted a two-stage study to examine the impact of a panel of 85 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the overall survival of 923 patients with 
NSCLC (568 in the screening set and 355 in the validation set) in China.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eleven single-nucleotide polymorphisms were 
primarily associated with NSCLC survival in the univariate analysis. However, in 
the validation set, only miR-30c-1 rs928508 was consistently an NSCLC survival 
predictor and the protective role of rs928508 AG/GG genotypes was more 
pronounced among early-stage (stage I/II) patients and patients treated with 
surgery. The area under the curve at Year 5 was significantly increased from 
0.658 to 0.741 after adding the miR-30c-1 rs928508 risk score to the traditional 
clinical risk score (stage and surgery). Furthermore, in the genotype-phenotype 
correlation analysis, rs928508 AG/GG genotypes were associated with a 
significantly decreased expression of precursor and mature miR-30c (P = 0.009 
and 0.011), but not with that of its primary miRNA. The expression of the host 
nuclear transcription factor Y gene was correlated with pri-mir-30c-1, but not 
with rs928508 genotypes, implicating the coregulation of the transcription of 
nuclear transcription factor Y and pri-mir-30c-1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated, for the first time, that genetic polymorphisms 
in the pre-miRNA flanking region may be prognostic biomarkers of NSCLC, and 
rs928508 is such a potential candidate.
