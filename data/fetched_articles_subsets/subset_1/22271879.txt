PURPOSE: Treatment with ipilimumab can cause objective tumor responses in 
patients with metastatic melanoma. We have treated 177 evaluable patients in 
three clinical trials and have long-term follow-up to evaluate the durability of 
responses.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with metastatic melanoma were treated in three 
trials from 2002 to 2005. In protocol 1, 56 patients received ipilimumab with 
gp100 peptides. In protocol 2, 36 patients received ipilimumab with 
interleukin-2. In protocol 3, 85 patients received ipilimumab with intrapatient 
dose-escalation and were randomized to receive gp100 peptides. We have analyzed 
their long-term follow-up and survival data.
RESULTS: With median follow-up for protocols 1, 2, and 3 being 92, 84, and 71 
months, median survival was 14, 16, and 13 months with 5-year survival rates 
being 13%, 25%, and 23%, respectively. Patients in protocol 2 had a 17% complete 
response (CR) rate, compared with 7% in protocol 1 and 6% in protocol 3. These 
CR rates are higher than previously reported for the same trials because some 
patients who eventually became complete responders had continual tumor 
regression months to years after therapy. All but one of the 15 complete 
responders are ongoing at 54+ to 99+ months.
CONCLUSIONS: This report provides the longest follow-up of patients with 
melanoma treated with ipilimumab and shows that ipilimumab can induce durable, 
potentially curative tumor regression in a small percentage of patients with 
metastatic melanoma. The combination of ipilimumab and interleukin-2 seems to 
have an increased CR rate, but this needs to be tested in a randomized trial.
