BACKGROUND: Disturbances of dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmissions have 
been suggested to be involved in the pathomechanisms underlying psychotic 
symptoms of schizophrenia. In line with this concept, hyperlocomotion induced by 
the dopaminomimetic amphetamine and the uncompetitive antagonist of NMDA 
receptors MK-801 (dizocilpine) in rodents is a generally established model for 
screening of new potential antipsychotic drugs. Since recent studies have 
indicated that receptors for adenosine may be targets for antipsychotic therapy, 
the aim of the present study was to investigate an influence of 
5'-Cl-5'-deoxy-ENBA, a potent and selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist, on 
hyperlocomotion induced by amphetamine and MK-801.
METHODS: Locomotor activity was measured by Force Plate Actimeters where four 
force transducers located below the corners of the floor of the cage tracked the 
animal position on a Cartesian plane at each time point.
RESULTS: Hyperlocomotion induced by either amphetamine (1 mg/kg sc) or MK-801 
(0.3 mg/kg ip) was inhibited by 5'-Cl-5'-deoxy-ENBA (0.1 mg/kg ip). The effect 
of 5'-Cl-5'-deoxy-ENBA on the amphetamine- and MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion 
was antagonized by the selective antagonist of adenosine A1 receptor DPCPX at 
doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg ip, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that stimulation of adenosine A1 
receptors may produce antipsychotic effects.
