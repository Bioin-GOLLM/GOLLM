PURPOSE: Von Willebrand Factor C and EGF Domains (VWCE) is an important gene 
that regulates cell adhesion, migration, and interaction. However, the 
correlation between VWCE expression and immune infiltrating in breast cancer 
remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the correlation between VWCE 
expression and immune infiltration levels in breast cancer.
METHODS: The expression of VWCE was analyzed by the tumor immune estimation 
resource (TIMER) and DriverDB databases. Furthermore, genes co-expressed with 
VWCE and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were investigated by the STRING 
and Enrichr web servers. Also, we performed the single nucleotide variation 
(SNV), copy number variation (CNV), and pathway activity analysis through 
GSCALite. Subsequently, the relationship between VWCE expression and tumor 
immunity was analyzed by TIMER and TISIDB databases, and further verified the 
results using Quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and 
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The results showed that the expression of VWCE mRNA in breast cancer 
tissue was significantly lower than that in normal tissues. We found that the 
expression level of VWCE was associated with subtypes, estrogen receptor (ER), 
progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) 
status of breast cancer patients, but there was no significant difference in the 
expression of VWCE was found in age and nodal status. Further analyses indicated 
that VWCE was correlated with the activation or inhibition of multiple oncogenic 
pathways. Additionally, VWCE expression was negatively correlated with the 
expression of STAT1 (Th1 marker, r = - 0.12, p = 6e-05), but positively 
correlated with the expression of MS4A4A (r = 0.28, p = 0). These results 
suggested that the expression of VWCE was correlated with immune infiltration 
levels of Th1 and M2 macrophage in breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, VWCE expression was associated with a better 
prognosis and was immune infiltration in breast cancer. These findings 
demonstrate that VWCE is a potential prognostic biomarker and correlated with 
tumor immune cell infiltration, and maybe a promising therapeutic target in 
breast cancer.
