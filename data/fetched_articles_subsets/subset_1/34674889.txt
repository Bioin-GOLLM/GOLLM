OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic variants associated with chemotherapy-induced 
peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms among gynecologic cancer survivors and 
determine the variants' predictive power in addition to age and clinical factors 
at time of diagnosis.
METHODS: Participants of a prospective cohort study on gynecologic cancers 
provided a DNA saliva sample and reported CIPN symptoms (FACT/GOG-Ntx). 
Genotyping of 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified as 
related to platinum- or taxane-induced neuropathy was performed using iPLEX Gold 
method. Risk allele carrier frequencies of 19 SNPs that passed quality checks 
were compared between those with/without high CIPN symptoms using logistic 
regression, adjusting for age. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
using clinical risk factors (age, diabetes, BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index, 
previous cancer diagnosis) with and without the identified SNPs were compared.
RESULTS: 107 individuals received platinum or taxane-based chemotherapy and 
provided sufficient DNA for analysis. Median age was 65.1 years; 39.6% had 
obesity and 8.4% diabetes; most had ovarian (58.9%) or uterine cancer (29.0%). 
Two SNPs were significantly associated with high CIPN symptomatology: rs3753753 
in GPX7, OR = 2.55 (1.13, 5.72) and rs139887 in SOX10, 2.66 (1.18, 6.00). 
Including these two SNPs in a model with clinical characteristics led to an 
improved AUC for CIPN symptomatology (0.65 vs. 0.74, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic and clinical characteristics were predictive of higher CIPN 
symptomatology in gynecologic cancer survivors, and combining these factors 
resulted in superior predictive power compared with a model with clinical 
factors only. Prospective validation and assessment of clinical utility are 
warranted.
