In traditional herbal medicine, the Polyscias fruticosa has been frequently used 
for the treatment of ischemia and inflammation. Oxidative stress mediated by 
elevated glutamate levels cause neuronal cell death in ischemia and various 
neurodegenerative diseases. However, so far, the neuroprotective effects of this 
plant extract against glutamate-mediated cell death have not been investigated 
in cell models. The current study investigates the neuroprotective effects of 
ethanol extracts of Polyscias fruticosa (EEPF) and elucidates the underlying 
molecular mechanisms of EEPFs relevant to neuroprotection against 
glutamate-mediated cell death. The oxidative stress-mediated cell death was 
induced by 5 mM glutamate treatment in HT22 cells. The cell viability was 
measured by a tetrazolium-based EZ-Cytox reagent and Calcein-AM fluorescent dye. 
Intracellular Ca2+ and ROS levels were measured by fluorescent dyes, fluo-3 AM 
and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA), respectively. Protein 
expressions of p-AKT, BDNF, p-CREB, Bax, Bcl-2, and apoptosis-inducing factor 
(AIF) were determined by western blot analysis. The apoptotic cell death was 
measured by flow cytometry. The in vivo efficacy of EEPF was evaluated using the 
Mongolian gerbil mouse by surgery-induced brain ischemia. EEPF treatment showed 
a neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced cell death. The EEPF 
co-treatment reduced the intracellular Ca2+ and ROS and apoptotic cell death. 
Furthermore, it recovered the p-AKT, p-CREB, BDNF, and Bcl-2 levels decreased by 
glutamate. The EEPF co-treatment suppressed the activation of apoptotic Bax, the 
nuclear translocation of AIF, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway proteins (ERK1/2, p38, JNK). Further, EEPF treatment significantly 
rescued the degenerative neurons in the ischemia-induced Mongolian gerbil in 
vivo model. EEPF exhibited neuroprotective properties that suppress 
glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity. The underlying mechanism of EEPF is increasing 
the level of p-AKT, p-CREB, BDNF, and Bcl-2 associated with cell survival. It 
has therapeutic potential for the treatment of glutamate-mediated 
neuropathology.
