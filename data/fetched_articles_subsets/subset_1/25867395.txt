Genetic variations in the human β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR) gene are known to be 
involved in insufficient relaxation of the bladder muscle during urine storage. 
The Trp64Arg polymorphism in the β3-AR gene has been found to be an important 
regulator of the development of overactive bladder (OAB). However, the 
association between this polymorphism and OAB remains controversial. Therefore, 
we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the association between the Trp64Arg 
polymorphism and OAB risk. We examined 2 case-control studies, including a total 
of 149 OAB cases and 270 healthy controls. The meta-analysis results showed that 
the Arg allele of the β3-AR gene is positively associated with OAB 
susceptibility, while Arg allele carriers (Trp64Arg + Arg64Arg) showed positive 
associations with OAB. These results also demonstrated that the Trp64Arg 
polymorphism in the β3-AR gene is involved in the pathogenesis of OAB.
