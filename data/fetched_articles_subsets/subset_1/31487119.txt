BACKGROUND: The LRRK2 gene is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) as a 
number of mutations within the gene have been shown to be susceptibility 
factors. Studies on various global populations have determined that mutations 
such as G2019S, G2385R, and R1628P in LRRK2 increase the risk of developing PD 
while the N551K-R1398H haplotype is associated with conferring protection 
against developing PD. Here we report a study looking at the N551K and R1398H 
variants for the first time in the Malaysian population.
METHODS: Cases (523) which conformed to the United Kingdom PD Brain Bank 
Criteria for PD were recruited through trained neurologists and age- and 
ethnically matched controls (491) were individuals free of any neurological 
disorder. The N551K and R1398H mutations were genotyped using the Taqman SNP 
genotyping assay.
RESULTS: A significant protective association for N551K was found in those of 
Malay ancestry, with a protective trend seen for R1398H. A meta-analysis of 
Chinese individuals in this cohort with other published cohorts of Chinese 
ancestry indicated a significant protective role for N551K and R1398H.
CONCLUSION: This study reports that the N551K-R1398H haplotype is also relevant 
to the Malaysian population, with a significant protective effect found in those 
of Malay and Chinese ancestries.
