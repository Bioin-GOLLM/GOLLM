CD8 + T cells are essential for long-lasting HIV-1 control and have been 
harnessed to develop therapeutic and preventive approaches for people living 
with HIV-1 (PLWH). HIV-1 infection induces marked metabolic alterations. 
However, it is unclear whether these changes affect the anti-HIV function of 
CD8 + T cells. Here, we show that PLWH exhibit higher levels of plasma glutamate 
than healthy controls. In PLWH, glutamate levels positively correlate with HIV-1 
reservoir and negatively correlate with the anti-HIV function of CD8 + T cells. 
Single-cell metabolic modeling reveals glutamate metabolism is surprisingly 
robust in virtual memory CD8 + T cells (TVM). We further confirmed that 
glutamate inhibits TVM cells function via the mTORC1 pathway in vitro. Our 
findings reveal an association between metabolic plasticity and CD8 + T 
cell-mediated HIV control, suggesting that glutamate metabolism can be exploited 
as a therapeutic target for the reversion of anti-HIV CD8 + T cell function in 
PLWH.
