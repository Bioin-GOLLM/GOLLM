PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze the corneal morphology features 
and define mutations in the UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing 1 (UBIAD1) 
gene in patients with Schnyder corneal dystrophy from a Polish population.
METHODS: Five affected and 15 unaffected members originating from 3 families 
with Schnyder corneal dystrophy were included in the study. Phenotype analysis 
consisted of visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy with photography, time 
domain optical coherence tomography, spectral domain optical coherence 
tomography, and confocal microscopy. Three patients underwent a penetrating 
keratoplasty. Corneal buttons obtained from the penetrating keratoplasty were 
processed for light microscopy.
RESULTS: A novel mutation I245N of the UBIAD1 gene was revealed in 1 proband and 
associated with the phenotype without central corneal opacities. The analysis of 
the other patients showed the N102S mutation. In vivo corneal morphology 
analysis using optical coherence tomography and confocal microscopy confirmed 
the presence of multiple crystalline corneal deposits in all affected corneas. 
The histological examination revealed multiple empty widenings of the corneal 
lamellae that could represent lipids removed from the specimen.
CONCLUSIONS: N102S may also be a mutation hotspot in the Polish population, as 
in other previously reported populations. Corneal crystals formed a 
characteristic pattern on optical coherence tomography scans.
