Barth Syndrome (BTHS) is a rare X-linked recessive inborn error of metabolism, 
which is characterized by dilated cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy 
and short stature. Barth Syndrome is associated with mutations in the tafazzin 
(TAZ) gene at Xq28 that result in cardiolipin deficiency and abnormal 
mitochondria. Here we report a 5.5-month old boy with BTHS phenotype who carries 
a novel missense T43P mutation in exon 2 of the TAZ gene.
