Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) converts plasminogen to plasmin. 
Plasmin is involved in processing of amyloid precursor protein and degrades 
secreted and aggregated amyloid-beta, a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). 
PLAU, the gene encoding uPA, maps to chromosome 10q22.2 between two regions 
showing linkage to late-onset AD (LOAD). We genotyped a frequent C/T single 
nucleotide polymorphism in codon 141 of PLAU (P141L) in 347 patients with LOAD 
and 291 control subjects. LOAD was associated with homozygous C/C PLAU genotype 
in the whole sample (chi2=15.7, P=0.00039, df 2), as well as in all sub-samples 
stratified by gender or APOE epsilon4 carrier status (chi2> or = 6.84, P< or 
=0.033, df 2). Odds ratio for LOAD due to homozygosity C/C was 1.89 (95% 
confidence interval 1.37-2.61). PLAU is a promising new candidate gene for LOAD, 
with allele C (P141) being a recessive risk allele or allele T (L141) conferring 
protection.
