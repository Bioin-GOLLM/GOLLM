OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the lipin1 
rs13412852 C>T polymorphism is associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and 
fibrosis in pediatric Italian patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD).
METHODS: A total of 142 untreated, consecutive children and 115 adults with 
biopsy-proven NAFLD and 337 healthy controls without steatosis were studied. 
Liver histology was assessed by the NAFLD activity score and the rs13412852 
polymorphism by a 5' nuclease Taqman assay.
RESULTS: Homozygosity for the rs13412852 T allele was underrepresented in 
pediatric, but not adult, patients with NAFLD compared with healthy controls (7% 
vs 14%; odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-0.91), and it 
was associated with lower triglycerides both in pediatric patients and healthy 
controls (P ≤ 0.01). Affected children carrying the rs13412852 TT genotype had a 
trend for a lower prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and significantly 
less severe liver damage, as indicated by NAFLD activity score severity (P = 
0.026) and a lower prevalence of liver fibrosis (P = 0.012). The negative 
association between rs13412852 TT genotype and fibrosis was independent of 
Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing-3 genotype and other clinical risk 
factors, including age, waist circumference, the presence of hyperglycemia, and 
alanine transaminase levels (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.11-0.66), and it was confirmed at 
multivariate analysis in adults (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.02-0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: Lipin1 rs13412852 single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with 
the severity of liver damage and fibrosis progression in pediatric patients with 
histological NAFLD.
