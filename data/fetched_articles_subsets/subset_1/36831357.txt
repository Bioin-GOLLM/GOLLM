BACKGROUND: The findings of earlier investigations of antiapoptotic gene 
genotypes and allele variants on lymphoma risk are ambiguous. This study aimed 
to examine the relationship between the mutation in the antiapoptotic genes and 
lymphoma risk among Saudi patients.
METHODS: This case-control study included 205 patients, 100 of whom had lymphoma 
(cases) and 105 who were healthy volunteers (controls). We used tetra 
amplification refractory mutation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify 
antiapoptotic genes such as B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2-938 C > A), MCL1-rs9803935 T 
> G, and survivin (BIRC5-rs17882312 G > C and BIRC5-rs9904341 G > C). 
Allelic-specific PCR was used to identify alleles such as BIRC5-C, MCL1-G, and 
BIRC5-G.
RESULTS: The dominant inheritance model among cases showed that mutations in all 
four antiapoptotic genes were more likely to be associated with the risk of 
lymphoma by the odds of 2.0-, 1.98-, 3.90-, and 3.29-fold, respectively, 
compared to controls. Apart from the BCL-2-A allele, all three specified alleles 
were more likely to be associated with lymphoma by the odds of 2.04-, 1.65-, and 
2.11-fold, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Unlike healthy individuals, lymphoma patients are more likely to 
have antiapoptotic gene genotypes and allele variants, apart from BCL-2-A 
alterations. In the future, these findings could be used to classify and 
identify patients at risk of lymphoma.
