In vertebrates, nucleostemin (NS) is an important marker of proliferation in 
several types of stem and cancer cells, and it can also interact with the 
tumor-suppressing transcription factor p53. In the present study, the 
intra-nuclear diffusional dynamics of native NS tagged with GFP and two 
GFP-tagged NS mutants with deleted guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding domains 
were analyzed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Free and slow binding 
diffusion coefficients were evaluated, either under normal culture conditions or 
under treatment with specific cellular proliferation inhibitors actinomycin D 
(ActD), 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), or trichostatin 
A (TSA). When treated with ActD, the fractional ratio of the slow diffusion was 
significantly decreased in the nucleoplasm. The decrease was proportional to 
ActD treatment duration. In contrast, DRB or TSA treatment did not affect NS 
diffusion. Interestingly, it was also found that the rate of diffusion of two NS 
mutants increased significantly even under normal conditions. These results 
suggest that the mobility of NS in the nucleoplasm is related to the initiation 
of DNA or RNA replication, and that the GTP-binding motif is also related to the 
large change of mobility.
