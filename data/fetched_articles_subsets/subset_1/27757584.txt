BACKGROUND: Dent disease is a rare X-linked recessive proximal tubulopathy 
caused by mutations in CLCN5 (Dent-1) or OCRL (Dent-2). As a rule, total protein 
excretion (TPE) is low in tubular proteinuria compared with glomerular disease. 
Several authors have reported nephrotic-range proteinuria (NP) and 
glomerulosclerosis in Dent disease. Therefore, we aimed to analyze protein 
excretion in patients with documented CLCN5 or OCRL mutations in a systematic 
literature review.
DESIGN: PubMed and Embase were searched for cases with documented CLCN5 or OCRL 
mutations and (semi-)quantitative data on protein excretion. The most reliable 
data (i.e., TPE > protein-creatinine ratio > Albustix) was used for NP 
classification.
RESULTS: Data were available on 148 patients from 47 reports: 126 had a CLCN5 
and 22 an OCRLmutation. TPE was not significantly different between both forms 
(p = 0.11). Fifty-five of 126 (43.7 %) Dent-1 vs 13/22 (59.1 %) Dent-2 patients 
met the definition of NP (p = 0.25). Serum albumin was normal in all reported 
cases (24/148). Glomerulosclerosis was noted in 20/32 kidney biopsies and was 
strongly related to tubulointerstitial fibrosis, but not to kidney function or 
proteinuria.
CONCLUSION: More than half of the patients with both forms of Dent disease have 
NP, and the presence of low molecular weight proteinuria in a patient with NP in 
the absence of edema and hypoalbuminemia should prompt genetic testing. Even 
with normal renal function, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis 
are present in Dent disease. The role of proteinuria in the course of the 
disease needs to be examined further in longitudinal studies.
