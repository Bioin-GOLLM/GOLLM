Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are in the mitochondrial inner membrane and belong to 
the transporter family. The biological function of UCPs is regulating discharge 
of proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain. As a result, the 
production of ATP is diminished, and dissipative heat is yielded. The present 
study was designed to investigate the association of UCP gene with chicken 
growth and body composition traits. The ninth generation of the broiler lines 
divergently selected for abdominal fat was used as a research population. 
Primers for UCP gene were designed from chicken genomic sequence. A 
single-nucleotide polymorphism, in the exon3 (T1316C) of UCP gene was detected 
by the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment polymorphism 
(PCR-RFLP) method. The UCP polymorphism was associated with muscle and fatness 
traits, such as pectoralis minor weight and abdominal fat weight. The results 
indicated that UCP gene could be a candidate locus or linked to a major gene 
which affects muscle and fatness traits in chicken.
