BACKGROUND: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation, also known as the 
diamond mutation in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has been treated with 
tremendous success since it was first reported in 2007. Alectinib, a second 
generation ALK-Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has been reported to have 
significantly longer progression- free survival (PFS) than first generation ALK 
inhibitors in untreated ALK positive NSCLC. However, the clinical efficacy of 
ALK-TKIs on rare ALK fusions remains unclear. In recent years, with the 
popularity of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, an increasing number 
of novel ALK fusion partners have been reported, but the responses are 
heterogeneous among different ALK fusions. Considering the inconsistent 
reactions, the clinical efficacy of ALK-TKIs in rare ALK gene fusions remains to 
be evaluated in more cases.
METHODS: To seek for individualized therapy, the tumor tissues acquired during 
biopsy were sent for genomic testing by NGS based on a 139-gene panel and a 
425-gene panel in a centralized clinical testing center (GENESEEQ Technology 
Inc, Nanjing, China). See Supplementary Material for more details about the 
methods for DNA-based NGS, RNA-based NGS.
RESULTS: We present two cases of patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring two 
novel Intergenic Region (IGR)-ALK rearrangements detected by DNA sequencing, 
which had limited clinical response to ALK-TKIs but showed sensitivity to 
chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab therapy in patient 2, with a PFS of over 
1 year up till the last follow-up assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our cases emphasize the need for comprehensive 
molecular analysis of different ALK fusion partners at the DNA level to 
formulate accurate treatment strategies and provide a certain therapeutic 
reference for these two types of novel IGR-ALK fusions.
