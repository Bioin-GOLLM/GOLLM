MOTIVATION: Achieving a near complete understanding of how the genome of an 
individual affects the phenotypes of that individual requires deciphering the 
order of variations along homologous chromosomes in species with diploid 
genomes. However, true diploid assembly of long-range haplotypes remains 
challenging.
RESULTS: To address this, we have developed Haplotype-resolved Assembly for 
Synthetic long reads using a Trio-binning strategy, or HAST, which uses parental 
information to classify reads into maternal or paternal. Once sorted, these 
reads are used to independently de novo assemble the parent-specific haplotypes. 
We applied HAST to cobarcoded second-generation sequencing data from an Asian 
individual, resulting in a haplotype assembly covering 94.7% of the reference 
genome with a scaffold N50 longer than 11 Mb. The high haplotyping precision 
(∼99.7%) and recall (∼95.9%) represents a substantial improvement over the 
commonly used tool for assembling cobarcoded reads (Supernova), and is 
comparable to a trio-binning-based third generation long-read-based assembly 
method (TrioCanu) but with a significantly higher single-base accuracy [up to 
99.99997% (Q65)]. This makes HAST a superior tool for accurate haplotyping and 
future haplotype-based studies.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The code of the analysis is available at
