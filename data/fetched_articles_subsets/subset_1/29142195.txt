Cysteine can be synthesized by tRNA-dependent mechanism using a two-step 
indirect pathway, where O-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS) catalyzes the 
ligation of a mismatching O-phosphoserine (Sep) to tRNACys followed by the 
conversion of tRNA-bounded Sep into cysteine by Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase 
(SepCysS). In ancestral methanogens, a third protein SepCysE forms a bridge 
between the two enzymes to create a ternary complex named the transsulfursome. 
By combination of X-ray crystallography, SAXS and EM, together with biochemical 
evidences, here we show that the three domains of SepCysE each bind SepRS, 
SepCysS, and tRNACys, respectively, which mediates the dynamic architecture of 
the transsulfursome and thus enables a global long-range channeling of tRNACys 
between SepRS and SepCysS distant active sites. This channeling mechanism could 
facilitate the consecutive reactions of the two-step indirect pathway of 
Cys-tRNACys synthesis (tRNA-dependent cysteine biosynthesis) to prevent 
challenge of translational fidelity, and may reflect the mechanism that cysteine 
was originally added into genetic code.
