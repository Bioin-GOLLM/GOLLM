Telomerase is an enzyme that adds repetitive DNA sequences to the ends of 
chromosomes and consists of two main subunits: the telomerase reverse 
transcriptase (TERT) protein and an associated telomerase RNA (TER). The 
telomerase essential N-terminal (TEN) domain is a conserved region of TERT 
proposed to mediate DNA substrate interactions. Here, we have employed single 
molecule telomerase binding assays to investigate the function of the TEN 
domain. Our results reveal telomeric DNA substrates bound to telomerase exhibit 
a dynamic equilibrium between two states: a docked conformation and an 
alternative conformation. The relative stabilities of the docked and alternative 
states correlate with the number of basepairs that can be formed between the DNA 
substrate and the RNA template, with more basepairing favoring the docked state. 
The docked state is further buttressed by the TEN domain and mutations within 
the TEN domain substantially alter the DNA substrate structural equilibrium. We 
propose a model in which the TEN domain stabilizes short RNA-DNA duplexes in the 
active site of the enzyme, promoting the docked state to augment telomerase 
processivity.
