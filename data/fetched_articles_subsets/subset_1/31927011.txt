BACKGROUND: Homoisoflavonoids have been shown to have potent anti-proliferative 
activities in endothelial cells over other cell types and have demonstrated a 
strong antiangiogenic potential in vitro and in vivo in animal models of ocular 
neovascularization. Three species of Rhodocodon (Scilloideaea subfamily of the 
Asparagaceae family), endemic to Madagascar, R. cryptopodus, R. rotundus and R. 
cyathiformis, were investigated.
PURPOSE: To isolate and test homoisoflavonoids for their antiangiogenic activity 
against human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs), as well as 
specificity against other ocular cell lines.
METHODS: Plant material was extracted at room temperature with EtOH. Compounds 
were isolated using flash column chromatography and were identified using NMR 
and CD spectroscopy and HRESIMS. Compounds were tested for antiproliferative 
effects on primary human microvascular retinal endothelial cells (HRECs), ARPE19 
retinal pigment epithelial cells, 92-1 uveal melanoma cells, and Y79 
retinoblastoma cells. HRECs exposed to compounds were also tested for migration 
and tube formation ability.
RESULTS: Two homoisoflavonoids, 
3S-5,7-dihydroxy-(3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxybenzyl)-4-chromanone (1) and 
3S-5,7-dihydroxy-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxybenzyl)-4-chromanone (2), were isolated 
along with four bufadienolides. Compound 1 was found to be non-specifically 
antiproliferative, with GI50 values ranging from 0.21-0.85 μM across the four 
cell types, while compound 2 showed at least 100-fold specificity for HRECs over 
the other tested cell lines. Compound 1, with a 3S configuration, was 700 times 
more potent that the corresponding 3R enantiomer recently isolated from a 
Massonia species.
CONCLUSION: Select homoisoflavonoids have promise as antiangiogenic agents that 
are not generally cytotoxic.
