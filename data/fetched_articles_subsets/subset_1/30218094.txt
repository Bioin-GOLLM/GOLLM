Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a structural heart disease that causes 
dilatation of cardiac chambers and impairs cardiac contractility. The SCN5A gene 
encodes Nav1.5, the predominant cardiac sodium channel alpha subunit. SCN5A 
mutations have been identified in patients with arrhythmic disorders associated 
with DCM. The characterization of Nav1.5 mutations located in the voltage sensor 
domain (VSD) and associated with DCM revealed divergent biophysical defects that 
do not fully explain the pathologies observed in these patients. The purpose of 
this study was to characterize the pathological consequences of a gating pore in 
the heart arising from the Nav1.5/R219H mutation in a patient with complex 
cardiac arrhythmias and DCM. We report its properties using cardiomyocytes 
derived from patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells. We showed 
that this mutation generates a proton leak (called gating pore current). We also 
described disrupted ionic homeostasis, altered cellular morphology, electrical 
properties, and contractile function, most probably linked to the proton leak. 
We thus propose a novel link between SCN5A mutation and the complex pathogenesis 
of cardiac arrhythmias and DCM. Furthermore, we suggest that leaky channels 
would constitute a common pathological mechanism underlying several neuronal, 
neuromuscular, and cardiac pathologies.
