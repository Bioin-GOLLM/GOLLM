BACKGROUND: Genetic variants of TOLLIP and MUC5B, both on chromosome 11, have 
been reported to be associated with the development and/or prognosis of 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This retrospective study was conducted to 
investigate the association of MUC5B and TOLLIP SNPs with disease outcome in 
IPF. 62 IPF patients and 50 healthy controls (HC) from our Institution were 
genotyped for SNPs within MUC5B (rs35705950) and TOLLIP (rs3750920 and 
rs5743890). Correlation of SNPs genotypes with survival, acute exacerbation (AE) 
or disease progression (defined as a decline of ≥ 5% in FVC and or ≥ 10% in DLco 
in one year) was investigated.
RESULTS: The MUC5B rs35705950 minor allele (T) was more frequent in IPF subjects 
than in HC (35% vs 9% p < 0.001). TOLLIP SNPs alleles and genotype distribution 
did not differ between IPF and HC and did not vary according to gender, age, BMI 
and lung functional impairment at baseline. The minor allele (C) in TOLLIP 
rs5743890 was associated with worse survival and with disease progression in all 
performed analyses. The MUC5B rs35705950 or the TOLLIP rs3750920 minor allele, 
were not associated with disease progression or AE.
CONCLUSION: We confirm that the minor allele of MUC5B rs35705950 is associated 
with IPF. The minor allele of TOLLIP rs5743890 appears to be a predictor of 
worse survival and more rapid disease progression, therefore being of potential 
utility to stratify IPF patients at baseline.
