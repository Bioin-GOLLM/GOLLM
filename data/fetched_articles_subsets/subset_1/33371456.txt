Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effectors capable of broad 
cytotoxicity via germline-encoded receptors and can have conferred cytotoxic 
potential via the addition of chimeric antigen receptors. Combined with their 
reduced risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS), NK cells are an attractive therapeutic platform. While significant 
progress has been made in treating hematological malignancies, challenges remain 
in using NK cell-based therapy to combat solid tumors due to their 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs). The development of novel 
strategies enabling NK cells to resist the deleterious effects of the TME is 
critical to their therapeutic success against solid tumors. In this review, we 
discuss strategies that apply various genetic and non-genetic engineering 
approaches to enhance receptor-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity, improve NK cell 
resistance to TME effects, and enhance persistence in the TME. The successful 
design and application of these strategies will ultimately lead to more 
efficacious NK cell therapies to treat patients with solid tumors. This review 
outlines the mechanisms by which TME components suppress the anti-tumor activity 
of endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells while also describing various 
approaches whose implementation in NK cells may lead to a more robust 
therapeutic platform against solid tumors.
