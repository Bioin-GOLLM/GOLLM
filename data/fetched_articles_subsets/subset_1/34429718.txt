A novel capillary-based microfluidic strategy to accelerate the process of 
small-molecule-compound screening by room-temperature X-ray crystallography 
using protein crystals is reported. The ultra-thin microfluidic devices are 
composed of a UV-curable polymer, patterned by cleanroom photolithography, and 
have nine capillary channels per chip. The chip was designed for ease of sample 
manipulation, sample stability and minimal X-ray background. 3D-printed frames 
and cassettes conforming to SBS standards are used to house the capillary chips, 
providing additional mechanical stability and compatibility with automated 
liquid- and sample-handling robotics. These devices enable an innovative in situ 
crystal-soaking screening workflow, akin to high-throughput compound screening, 
such that quantitative electron density maps sufficient to determine weak 
binding events are efficiently obtained. This work paves the way for adopting a 
room-temperature microfluidics-based sample delivery method at synchrotron 
sources to facilitate high-throughput protein-crystallography-based screening of 
compounds at high concentration with the aim of discovering novel binding events 
in an automated manner.
