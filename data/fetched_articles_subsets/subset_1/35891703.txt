INTRODUCTION: The adult heart lacks the regenerative capacity to self-repair. 
Serum response factor (SRF) is essential for heart organogenesis, 
sarcomerogenesis, and contractility. SRF interacts with co-factors, such as 
NKX2.5 and GATA4, required for cardiac specified gene activity. ETS factors such 
as ELK1 interact with SRF and drive cell replication. To weaken SRF interactions 
with NKX2.5 and GATA4, one mutant, SRF153(A3) named STEMIN, did not bind CArG 
boxes, yet induced stem cell factors such as NANOG and OCT4, cardiomyocyte 
dedifferentiation, and cell cycle reentry. The mutant YAP5SA of the Hippo 
pathway also promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and growth.
AIM: Infarcted adult mouse hearts were injected with translatable STEMIN and 
YAP5SA mmRNA to evaluate their clinical potential.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were pulsed one day later with alpha-EDU and then 
heart sections were DAPI stained. Replicating cells were identified by 
immuno-staining against members of the DNA replisome pathway that mark entry to 
S phase of the cell cycle. Echocardiography was used to determine cardiac 
function following infarcts and mRNA treatment. To monitor cardiac wall repair, 
microscopic analysis was performed, and the extent of myocardial fibrosis was 
analyzed for immune cell infiltration. Injections of STEMIN and YAP5SA mmRNA 
into the left ventricles of infarcted adult mice promoted a greater than 17-fold 
increase in the DAPI stained and alpha-EDU marked cardiomyocyte nuclei, within a 
day. We observed de novo expression of phospho-histone H3, ORC2, MCM2, and 
CLASPIN. Cardiac function was significantly improved by four weeks post-infarct, 
and fibrosis and immune cell infiltration were diminished in hearts treated with 
STEMIN and YAP5SA mmRNA than each alone.
CONCLUSION: STEMIN and YAP5SA mmRNA improved cardiac function and myocardial 
fibrosis in left ventricles of infarcted adult mice. The combinatorial use of 
mmRNA encoding STEMIN and YAP5SA has the potential to become a powerful clinical 
strategy to treat human heart disease.
