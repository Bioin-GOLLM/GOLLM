Biological electron transfer is challenging to directly regulate using 
environmental conditions. To enable dynamic, protein-level control over energy 
flow in metabolic systems for synthetic biology and bioelectronics, we created 
ferredoxin logic gates that utilize transcriptional and post-translational 
inputs to control energy flow through a synthetic electron transfer pathway that 
is required for bacterial growth. These logic gates were created by subjecting a 
thermostable, plant-type ferredoxin to backbone fission and fusing the resulting 
fragments to a pair of proteins that self-associate, a pair of proteins whose 
association is stabilized by a small molecule, and to the termini of a 
ligand-binding domain. We show that the latter domain insertion design strategy 
yields an allosteric ferredoxin switch that acquires an oxygen-tolerant [2Fe-2S] 
cluster and can use different chemicals, including a therapeutic drug and an 
environmental pollutant, to control the production of a reduced metabolite in 
Escherichia coli and cell lysates.
