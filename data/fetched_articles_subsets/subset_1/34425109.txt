Ubiquitination is a crucial posttranslational protein modification involved in a 
myriad of biological pathways. This modification is reversed by deubiquitinases 
(DUBs) that deconjugate the single ubiquitin (Ub) moiety or poly-Ub chains from 
substrates. In the past decade, tremendous efforts have been focused on 
targeting DUBs for drug discovery. However, most chemical compounds with 
inhibitory activity for DUBs suffer from mild potency and low selectivity. To 
overcome these obstacles, we developed a phage display-based protein engineering 
strategy for generating Ub variant (UbV) inhibitors, which was previously 
successfully applied to the Ub-specific protease (USP) family of cysteine 
proteases. In this work, we leveraged the UbV platform to selectively target 
STAMBP, a member of the JAB1/MPN/MOV34 (JAMM) metalloprotease family of DUB 
enzymes. We identified two UbVs (UbVSP.1 and UbVSP.3) that bind to STAMBP with 
high affinity but differ in their selectivity for the closely related paralog 
STAMBPL1. We determined the STAMBPL1-UbVSP.1 complex structure by X-ray 
crystallography, revealing hotspots of the JAMM-UbV interaction. Finally, we 
show that UbVSP.1 and UbVSP.3 are potent inhibitors of STAMBP isopeptidase 
activity, far exceeding the reported small-molecule inhibitor BC-1471. This work 
demonstrates that UbV technology is suitable to develop molecules as tools to 
target metalloproteases, which can be used to further understand the cellular 
function of JAMM family DUBs.
