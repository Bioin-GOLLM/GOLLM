Neuroblastoma continues to be a devastating childhood solid tumor and is 
responsible for over 15% of all childhood cancer-related deaths. Focal adhesion 
kinase (FAK) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) are 
protein tyrosine kinases that are overexpressed in a number of human cancers, 
including neuroblastoma. These two kinases can directly interact and provide 
survival signals to cancer cells. In this study, we utilized siRNA to VEGFR-3 to 
demonstrate the biologic importance of this kinase in neuroblastoma cell 
survival. We also used confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation to show that 
FAK and VEGFR-3 bind in neuroblastoma. Finally, employing a 12-amino-acid 
peptide (AV3) specific to VEGFR-3, we showed that the colocalization between FAK 
and VEGFR-3 could be disrupted, and that disruption resulted in decreased 
neuroblastoma cell survival. These studies provide insight to the FAK-VEGFR-3 
interaction in neuroblastoma and demonstrate its importance in this tumor type. 
Focusing upon the FAK-VEGFR-3 interaction may provide a novel therapeutic target 
for the development of new strategies for treatment of neuroblastoma.
