Penetrance and age of onset of ATTRV30M amyloidotic neuropathy varies 
significantly among different populations. This variability has been attributed 
to both genetic and environmental modifiers. We studied the effect of genetic 
background on phenotype in two lines of transgenic mice bearing the same 
ATTRV30M transgene. Amyloid deposition, transthyretin (TTR), megalin, clusterin 
and disease markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, the ubiquitin-proteasome 
system, apoptosis, and complement activation were assessed with WB and 
immunohistochemistry in donor and recipient tissue. Our results indicate that 
genetic background modulates amyloid deposition by influencing TTR handling in 
recipient tissue and may partly account for the marked variability in penetrance 
observed in various world populations.
