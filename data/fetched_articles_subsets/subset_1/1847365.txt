The nusA11 mutation causes reduced transcription termination and 
temperature-sensitive growth of Escherichia coli. Suppressor mutations that 
restored growth of nusA11 mutant cells were isolated and named sna mutations. 
The intergenic suppressor mutation sna-10 was located in the rpoC gene at 90 
min, which encodes the beta' subunit of RNA polymerase. sna-10 complemented the 
defect in tR1 termination caused by nusA11 and by itself stimulated termination 
of transcription at the lambda tR1 terminator. sna-10 is specific to the nusA11 
allele and unable to suppress cold-sensitive growth of the nusA10 mutant. nusA10 
carried two base substitutions at positions 311 and 634, causing two amino acid 
changes from the wild-type sequence. During these studies, we found three -1 
frameshift errors in the wild-type nusA sequence; the correct sequence was 
confirmed by the peptide sequence and gene fusion analyses. The revised sequence 
revealed that nusA1 and nusA11 are located in an arginine-rich peptide region 
and substitute arginine and aspartate for leucine 183 and glycine 181, 
respectively. The intragenic suppressor study indicated that the nusA11 mutation 
can be suppressed by changing the mutated aspartate 181 to alanine or changing 
aspartate 84 to tyrosine.
