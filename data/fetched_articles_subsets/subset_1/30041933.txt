BACKGROUND: IARS2 encodes isoleucine-tRNA synthetase, which is aclass-1 amino 
acyl-tRNA synthetase. IARS2 mutations are reported to cause Leigh syndrome or 
cataracts, growth hormone deficiency, sensory neuropathy, sensorineural hearing 
loss, and skeletal dysphasia syndrome (CAGSSS). To our knowledge, IARS2 
mutations and diseases related to it have only been reported in three families. 
Here we report a case of two Japanese siblings with Leigh syndrome, some 
features of CAGSSS, and West syndrome that are found to have compound 
heterozygous novel IARS2 mutations.
CASE REPORT: A 7-month-old Japanese girl presented with infantile spasms. Brain 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse brain atrophy and 
hyperintensity in the bilateral basal ganglia. Three years later, her younger 
sister also presented with infantile spasms. MRI revealed diffuse brain atrophy 
and hyperintensity of the bilateral ganglia, suggesting Leigh syndrome. The 
siblings were identified with compound heterozygous missense mutations in IARS2, 
p.[(Phe227Ser)];[(Arg817His)].
CONCLUSION: This is the first case study reporting Leigh syndrome concomitant 
with some features of CAGSSS in siblings with novel IARS2 mutations, thereby 
broadening the phenotypic spectrum of IARS2-related disorders. Further studies 
are warranted to elucidate the nature of these disorders.
