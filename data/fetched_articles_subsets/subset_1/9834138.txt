IKs channels are voltage dependent and K+ selective. They influence cardiac 
action potential duration through their contribution to myocyte repolarization. 
Assembled from minK and KvLQT1 subunits, IKs channels are notable for a 
heteromeric ion conduction pathway in which both subunit types contribute to 
pore formation. This study was undertaken to assess the effects of minK on pore 
function. We first characterized the properties of wild-type human IKs channels 
and channels formed only of KvLQT1 subunits. Channels were expressed in Xenopus 
laevis oocytes or Chinese hamster ovary cells and currents recorded in excised 
membrane patches or whole-cell mode. Unitary conductance estimates were 
dependent on bandwidth due to rapid channel "flicker." At 25 kHz in symmetrical 
100-mM KCl, the single-channel conductance of IKs channels was approximately 16 
pS (corresponding to approximately 0.8 pA at 50 mV) as judged by noise-variance 
analysis; this was fourfold greater than the estimated conductance of homomeric 
KvLQT1 channels. Mutant IKs channels formed with D76N and S74L minK subunits are 
associated with long QT syndrome. When compared with wild type, mutant channels 
showed lower unitary currents and diminished open probabilities with only minor 
changes in ion permeabilities. Apparently, the mutations altered single-channel 
currents at a site in the pore distinct from the ion selectivity apparatus. 
Patients carrying these mutant minK genes are expected to manifest decreased K+ 
flux through IKs channels due to lowered single-channel conductance and altered 
gating.
