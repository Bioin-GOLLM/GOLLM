Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder which influences around 1% of the 
worldwide population. Differences between male and female patients with 
schizophrenia have been noted. There is an earlier age of onset in males 
compared with females with this diagnosis, and in addition, there are 
differences in symptom profiles between the sexes. The underlying molecular 
mechanism of sex difference remains unclear. Here we present a comprehensive 
analysis to reveal the sex differences in gene expression in schizophrenia with 
stringent statistics criteria. We compiled a data set consisting of 89 male 
controls, 90 male schizophrenia patients, 35 female controls and 32 female 
schizophrenia patients from six independent studies of the prefrontal cortex 
(PFC) in postmortem brain. When we tested for a sex by diagnosis interaction on 
gene expression, 23 genes were up-regulated and 23 genes were down-regulated in 
the male group (q-value < 0.05), several genes are related to energy metabolism, 
while 4 genes are located on sex chromosome. No genes were statistically 
significant in the female group when multiple testing correction were conducted 
(q-value <0.05), most likely due to the small sample size. Our protocol and 
results from the male group provide a starting point for identifying the 
underlying different mechanism between male and female schizophrenia patients.
