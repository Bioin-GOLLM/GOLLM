OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between breast tissue specified 
variants in p53 binding sites and the risk of BC in Chinese women.
METHODS: ChIP-seq database on p53 binding sites in MCF-7 cell lines was 
extracted to identify the possible variants in p53 target genes. A 
hospital-based case-control study was then performed to investigate the 
association between variants in p53 binding sites and the risk of BC in a 
Chinese women population.
RESULTS: Three variants were identified from the bioinformatics analysis. A 
total of 1 274 BC cases and 1 255 frequency-matched cancer-free controls were 
included in this case-control study. The average age was comparable between the 
case and the control groups, with the P value as 0.318. Meanwhile, distributions 
on menopausal status, smoking and alcohol intake between cases and controls were 
similar with the P values as 0.539, 0.258 and 0.131, respectively. The genotype 
distribution of rs1295925 was significantly different between the case and the 
control groups. Individuals that carrying rs1295925-CT and rs1295925-TT 
genotypes were significantly associated with an increased BC risk when compared 
with rs1295925-CC genotype after adjustment of age, menopausal status, smoking 
and alcohol intake (OR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.07-1.62 and OR=1.41, 95%CI: 1.13-1.78, 
respectively). Positive associations were also observed under the allelic, 
dominant and additive models.
CONCLUSION: rs1295925 which located in VMP1 gene was associated with increased 
BC risk in the Chinese women population.
