FcR-like (FCRL) 2 is a transmembrane protein with immunomodulatory potential 
that is preferentially expressed by memory B cells in humans. It has two 
consensus ITIMs in addition to a putative ITAM sequence in its cytoplasmic 
domain. We have confirmed the cellular distribution of FCRL2 and analyzed its 
functional potential to show that coligation with the BCR leads to tyrosine 
phosphorylation of its ITIM motifs and subsequent Src homology region 2 
domain-containing phosphatase-1 recruitment to facilitate inhibition of BCR 
signaling. Mutational analysis indicates that the tyrosine residues in both 
inhibitory motifs of FCRL2 are required for complete inhibition of BCR 
signaling, whereas tyrosines in the putative activation motif are dispensable 
for signal modulation. These findings suggest a negative immunomodulatory 
function for FCRL2 in the regulation of memory B cells.
