Naturally occurring mutations to cytochrome c (cyt-c) have been identified 
recently in patients with mild autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia (low platelet 
levels), which yield cyt-c mutants with enhanced apoptotic activity. However, 
the molecular mechanism underlying this low platelet production and enhanced 
apoptosis remain unclear. Therefore, an attempt is made herein for the first 
time to investigate the effects of mutations of glycine 41 by serine (G41S) and 
tyrosine 48 by histidine (Y48H) on the conformational and dynamic changes of 
apoptotic (Fe3+) cyt-c using all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in 
explicit water solvent. Our 30ns MD simulations demonstrate considerable 
structural differences in G41S and Y48H compared to wild type (WT) cyt-c, such 
as increasing distances between the critical electron transfer residues results 
in open conformation at the heme active site, large fluctuations in β-turns and 
α-helices. Additionally, although the β-sheets remain mostly unaffected in all 
the three cyt-c simulations, the α-helices undergo conformational switch to 
β-turns in both the mutant simulations. Importantly, this conformational switch 
of α-helix to β-turn around heme active site should attributes to the loss of 
intraprotein H-bonds in the mutant simulations especially between NE2 (His26) 
and O (Pro44) in agreement with the experimental report. Further, essential 
dynamics analysis reveals that overall motions of WT cyt-c is mainly involved 
only in the first eigenvector, but in G41S and Y48H the overall motions are 
mainly in three and two eigenvectors respectively. Overall, the detailed 
atomistic level information provide a unifying description for the molecular 
mechanism of structural destabilization, disregulation of platelet formation and 
enhanced peroxidase activity of the mutant cyt-c's in the pathology of intrinsic 
apoptosis.
