Craniopharyngiomas are benign neoplasms with two histological subtypes: 
adamantinomatous and papillary. Papillary craniopharyngiomas are rare in 
children, and those with a pituitary abscess within are even rarer. Herein, we 
present the case of a 14-year-old boy with a papillary craniopharyngioma and a 
coexisting intratumoral abscess, who was hospitalized for persistent pyrexia, 
polyuria, and polydipsia. The absence of calcification on computed tomography, 
high signal intensity inside the tumor on diffusion-weighted imaging, and 
clinical findings such as fever, a high inflammatory response, and meningitis, 
as well as short-term morphological changes on imaging, could aid in diagnosis.
