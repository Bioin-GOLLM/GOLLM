Polydopamine (PDA) is a biocompatible cell-adhesive polymer with versatile 
applications in biomedical devices. Previous studies have shown that PDA coating 
could improve cell adhesion and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells 
(hMSCs). However, there is still a knowledge gap in the effect of PDA-mediated 
protein adsorption on the epigenetic status of MSCs. This work used 
gelatin-coated cell culture surfaces with and without PDA underlayer (Gel and 
PDA-Gel) to culture and differentiate primary human adipose-derived stem cells 
(hASCs). The properties of these two substrates were significantly different, 
which, in combination with a variation in extracellular matrix (ECM) protein 
bioactivity, regulated cell adhesion and migration. hASCs reduced focal 
adhesions by downregulating the expression of integrins such as αV, α1, α2, and 
β1 on the PDA-Gel compared to the Gel substrate. Interestingly, the ratio of 
H3K27me3 to H3K27me3+H3K4me3 was decreased, but this only occurred for 
upregulation of AGG and BMP4 genes during chondrogenic differentiation. This 
result implies that the PDA-Gel surface positively affects the chondrogenic, but 
not adipogenic and osteogenic, differentiation. In conclusion, for the first 
time, this study demonstrates the sequential effects of PDA coating on the 
biophysical property of adsorbed protein and then focal adhesions and 
differentiation of hMSCs through epigenetic regulation. This study sheds light 
on PDA-mediated mechanotransduction.
