The white potato cyst nematode, Globodera pallida, is an obligate biotrophic 
pathogen of a limited number of Solanaceous plants. Like other plant pathogens, 
G. pallida deploys effectors into its host that manipulate the plant to the 
benefit of the nematode. Genome analysis has led to the identification of large 
numbers of candidate effectors from this nematode, including the cyst 
nematode-specific SPRYSEC proteins. These are a secreted subset of a hugely 
expanded gene family encoding SPRY domain-containing proteins, many of which 
remain to be characterized. We investigated the function of one of these SPRYSEC 
effector candidates, GpSPRY-414-2. Expression of the gene encoding GpSPRY-414-2 
is restricted to the dorsal pharyngeal gland cell and reducing its expression in 
G. pallida infective second stage juveniles using RNA interference causes a 
reduction in parasitic success on potato. Transient expression assays in 
Nicotiana benthamiana indicated that GpSPRY-414-2 disrupts plant defenses. It 
specifically suppresses effector-triggered immunity (ETI) induced by 
co-expression of the Gpa2 resistance gene and its cognate avirulence factor 
RBP-1. It also causes a reduction in the production of reactive oxygen species 
triggered by exposure of plants to the bacterial flagellin epitope flg22. Yeast 
two-hybrid screening identified a potato cytoplasmic linker protein 
(CLIP)-associated protein (StCLASP) as a host target of GpSPRY-414-2. The two 
proteins co-localize in planta at the microtubules. CLASPs are members of a 
conserved class of microtubule-associated proteins that contribute to 
microtubule stability and growth. However, disruption of the microtubule network 
does not prevent suppression of ETI by GpSPRY-414-2 nor the interaction of the 
effector with its host target. Besides, GpSPRY-414-2 stabilizes its target while 
effector dimerization and the formation of high molecular weight protein 
complexes including GpSPRY-414-2 are prompted in the presence of the StCLASP. 
These data indicate that the nematode effector GpSPRY-414-2 targets the 
microtubules to facilitate infection.
