Although cranial radiotherapy is considered the standard treatment for brain 
metastasis (BM), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown promising 
activity in EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with BM. 
However, the efficacy of sequential cranial radiotherapy in patients with EGFR 
mutant NSCLC who are treated with EGFR TKIs remains to be determined. Patients 
with NSCLC who harbored an EGFR mutation and whose BM had been treated with EGFR 
TKIs were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical outcomes of patients treated 
with EGFR TKIs alone and those treated with cranial radiotherapy followed by 
EGFR TKIs (additive therapy) were compared. Of the 573 patients with NSCLC with 
BM who harbored an EGFR mutation and had received EGFR TKIs, 121 (21.1 %) had BM 
at the time of initial diagnosis. Fifty-nine (49 %) patients were treated with 
additive therapy, whereas 62 (51 %) patients were treated only with EGFR TKIs. 
No significant differences were observed between the additive therapy group and 
the EGFR TKI alone group regarding intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) 
(16.6 vs 21.0 months, p = 0.492) or extracranial PFS (12.9 vs 15.0 months, 
p = 0.770). The 3-year survival rates were similar in both groups (71.9 vs 
68.2 %, p = 0.675). Additive therapy consisting of cranial radiotherapy followed 
by EGFR TKI treatment did not improve OS or intracranial PFS compared with EGFR 
TKI treatment alone in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients with BM. Further prospective 
studies are needed to determine the precise benefits of sequential cranial 
radiotherapy in EGFR mutant NSCLC treated with EGFR TKIs.
