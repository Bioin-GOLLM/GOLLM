The FIP1L1-PDGFRA oncogene is a common cause of chronic eosinophilic leukemia 
(CEL), and encodes an activated tyrosine kinase that is inhibited by imatinib. 
FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive patients with CEL respond to low-dose imatinib therapy, 
but resistance due to acquired T674I mutation has been observed. We report here 
the identification of sorafenib as a potent inhibitor of the FIP1 like 
1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha) (T674I) 
mutant. Sorafenib inhibited the proliferation of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and 
FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha(T674I)-transformed Ba/F3 cells and induced apoptosis of the 
EOL-1 cell line at a low nanomolar concentration. Western blot analysis 
confirmed that these effects were due to a direct effect on FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha 
and FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha(T674I). Sorafenib was recently approved for the treatment 
of renal cell carcinoma. Our data suggest that low doses of sorafenib could be 
efficient for the treatment of FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive CEL and could be used to 
overcome resistance to imatinib associated with the T674I mutation.
