Background: The EGFR (epithelial growth factor receptor) ligands amphiregulin 
(AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) have been considered as predictors for 
EGFR-antibody efficacy. The effect of AREG and EREG expression levels in primary 
tumor samples on the outcome of bevacizumab-treated patients is unknown. 
Patients and Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from 
surgically removed primaries of the AIO KRK-0207 trial have been tested for AREG 
and EREG expression. The AIO KRK-0207 trial was a randomized phase-3 study to 
investigate the best maintenance strategy after oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidine 
plus bevacizumab induction treatment in patients with mCRC. Association of AREG 
and EREG levels with outcome parameters were investigated, taking into account 
RAS and BRAF mutations. Results: A total of 331 tumor samples had measurable 
AREG and EREG tissue levels. In the total cohort using continuous expression 
levels, higher logAREG and logEREG levels were associated with a significant 
longer overall survival (OS) (HR 0.80; p = 0.003 and HR 0.78; p = 0.001, 
respectively). The subgroup of BRAF mutant tumors displayed significantly lower 
AREG and EREG levels compared to wild-type tumors. The prognostic effect of AREG 
and EREG expression was limited to the double wild-type subpopulation, whereas 
in the RAS mutant and BRAF mutant subgroups no prognostic effect was detected. 
Conclusion: Low logAREG and logEREG levels are associated with a shorter OS in 
oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab treated patients. As low AREG and 
EREG level are associated with BRAF mutations, the prognostic value of EREG and 
AREG levels is limited to the RAS and BRAF wild-type subpopulation.
