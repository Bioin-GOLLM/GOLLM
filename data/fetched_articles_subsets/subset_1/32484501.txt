Excessive excitation is hypothesized to cause motoneuron (MN) degeneration in 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but actual proof of hyperexcitation in vivo 
is missing, and trials based on this concept have failed. We demonstrate, by in 
vivo single-MN electrophysiology, that, contrary to expectations, excitatory 
responses evoked by sensory and brainstem inputs are reduced in MNs of 
presymptomatic mutSOD1 mice. This impairment correlates with disrupted 
postsynaptic clustering of Homer1b, Shank, and AMPAR subunits. Synaptic 
restoration can be achieved by activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, by either 
intracellular injection of cAMP or DREADD-Gs stimulation. Furthermore, we 
reveal, through independent control of signaling and excitability allowed by 
multiplexed DREADD/PSAM chemogenetics, that PKA-induced restoration of synapses 
triggers an excitation-dependent decrease in misfolded SOD1 burden and autophagy 
overload. In turn, increased MN excitability contributes to restoring synaptic 
structures. Thus, the decrease of excitation to MN is an early but reversible 
event in ALS. Failure of the postsynaptic site, rather than hyperexcitation, 
drives disease pathobiochemistry.
