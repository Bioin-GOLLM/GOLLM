Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment regimes are amongst the longest, 
most intensive and complex used in hematooncology. Despite this, while treatment 
of pediatric ALL is a success story, we are far from being able to ensure a 
durable response in adult ALL. This is not due to failure of induction therapy 
as a complete remission (CR) is achieved in over 90% of patients. However the 
challenge remains in ensuring a sustained remission. Furthermore in the face of 
relapsed disease, salvage therapies currently offer a poor chance of a good 
outcome. This article reviews the novel agents which show the most promise in 
the treatment of adult ALL.
