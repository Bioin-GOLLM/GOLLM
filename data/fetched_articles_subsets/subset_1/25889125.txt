BACKGROUND: CYP17A1 gene encodes P450c17 proteins, which is a key enzyme that 
catalyzes the formation of sex hormones. Many clinical studies showed that sex 
hormones levels play an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery 
disease (CAD). However, the relationship between CYP17A1 genetic polymorphisms 
and CAD remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
association of CYP17A1 genetic polymorphisms with CAD in a Han population of 
China.
METHODS: A total of 997 people include 490 patients and 507 controls were 
selected for the present study. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
(rs4919686, rs1004467, rs4919687, rs10786712, and rs2486758) were genotyped by 
using the real-time PCR (TaqMan) method.
RESULTS: For men, the rs10786712 was found to be associated with CAD in a 
recessive model (P=0.016), after adjustment of the major confounding factors, 
the significant difference was retained (OR=1.644, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.087-2.488, P=0.019). For women, the rs1004467 was also found to be associated 
with CAD in a dominant model (P=0.038), the difference remained statistically 
significant after multivariate adjustment (OR=1.623, 95% CI: 1.023-2.576, 
P=0.040). The distribution of rs4919687 genotypes showed a significant 
difference between CAD and control participants in a recessive model (P=0.019), 
the significant difference was retained after adjustment for covariates 
(OR=0.417, 95% CI: 0.188-0.926, P=0.032).
CONCLUSION: Rs1004467, rs4919687, rs10786712 of CYP17A1 gene are associated with 
CAD in Han population of China. The TT genotype of rs10786712 could be a 
protective genetic marker of CAD in men. The CC genotype of rs1004467 and the AA 
genotype of rs4919687 could be risk genetic markers of CAD in women. However, 
large sample size study including other SNPs of CYP17A1 should be performed in 
future studies.
