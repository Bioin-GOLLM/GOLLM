The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a multi-subunit Ca2+-activated Ca2+ 
channel, made up of the pore-forming MCU protein, a metazoan-specific EMRE 
subunit, and MICU1/MICU2, which mediate Ca2+ activation. It has been established 
that metazoan MCU requires EMRE binding to conduct Ca2+, but how EMRE promotes 
MCU opening remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that EMRE controls MCU 
activity via its transmembrane helix, while using an N-terminal PKP motif to 
strengthen binding with MCU. Opening of MCU requires hydrophobic interactions 
mediated by MCU residues near the pore's luminal end. Enhancing these 
interactions by single mutation allows human MCU to transport Ca2+ without EMRE. 
We further show that EMRE may facilitate MCU opening by stabilizing the open 
state in a conserved MCU gating mechanism, present also in non-metazoan MCU 
homologs. These results provide insights into the evolution of the uniporter 
machinery and elucidate the mechanism underlying the physiologically crucial 
EMRE-dependent MCU activation process.
