There is an ever-increasing demand for next-generation devices that do not 
require passwords and are impervious to cloning. For traditional hardware 
security solutions in edge computing devices, inherent limitations are addressed 
by physical unclonable functions (PUF). However, realizing efficient roots of 
trust for resource constrained hardware remains extremely challenging, despite 
excellent demonstrations with conventional silicon circuits and archetypal oxide 
memristor-based crossbars. An attractive, down-scalable approach to design 
efficient cryptographic hardware is to harness memristive materials with a 
large-degree-of-randomness in materials state variations, but this strategy is 
still not well understood. Here, the utilization of high-degree-of-randomness 
amorphous (A) state variations associated with different operating conditions 
via thermal fluctuation effects is demonstrated, as well as an integrated 
framework for in memory computing and next generation security primitives, viz., 
APUF, for achieving secure key generation and device authentication. Near ideal 
uniformity and uniqueness without additional initial writing overheads in weak 
memristive A-PUF is achieved. In-memory computing empowers a strong exclusive OR 
(XOR-) and-repeat A PUF construction to avoid machine learning attacks, while 
rapid crystallization processes enable large-sized-key reconfigurability. These 
findings pave the way for achieving a broadly applicable security primitive for 
enhancing antipiracy of integrated systems and product authentication in supply 
chains.
