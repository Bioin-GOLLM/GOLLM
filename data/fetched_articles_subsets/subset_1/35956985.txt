Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease, but so far, it 
can only be treated symptomatically rather than changing the process of the 
disease. Recently, triazoles and their derivatives have been shown to have 
potential for the treatment of AD. In this study, the neuroprotective effects of 
4-(4-(heptyloxy)phenyl)-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one (W112) against 
β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced AD pathology and its possible mechanism were explored 
both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that W112 exhibits a 
neuroprotective role against Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells and improves 
the learning and memory abilities of Aβ-induced AD-like rats. In addition, the 
assays of the protein expression revealed that W112 reversed tau 
hyperphosphorylation and reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines, 
tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, both in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Further study indicated that the regulation of mitogen-activated protein 
kinase/nuclear factor-κB pathways played a key role in mediating the 
neuroprotective effects of W112 against AD-like pathology. W112 may become a 
potential drug for AD intervention.
