The criteria for differentiating symptomatic from asymptomatic HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorder require evaluation of (1) cognitive impairment, (2) 
daily functioning declines, and (3) whether the functional declines are 
attributable to cognitive versus physical problems. Many providers rely only on 
self-report to evaluate these latter criteria. However, the accuracy of 
patient-provided information may be limited. This study evaluated the validity 
of self-assessment for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) diagnoses 
by comparing objective findings with self-report of criteria 2 and 3 above. 
Self-reports were used to stratify 277 cognitively impaired HIV+ individuals 
into functionally dependent (n = 159) and independent (n = 118) groups, followed 
by group comparisons of objective functional problems. The dependent group was 
then divided into those who self-attributed their functional dependence to only 
cognitive (n = 80) versus only physical (n = 79) causes, for further comparisons 
on objective findings. The functionally dependent group was significantly worse 
than the independent group on all objective disability characteristics except 
severity of cognitive impairment, while those who attributed their dependence to 
physical (versus cognitive) factors were similar on all objective physical, 
cognitive, and functioning variables. Of note, 28 % of physical attributors 
showed no physical abnormalities on neuromedical examinations. Results suggest 
that patient report is consistently associated with objective measures of 
functional loss; in contrast, patient identification of physical versus 
cognitive causes is poorly associated with objective criteria. These findings 
caution against relying solely on patient self-report to determine whether 
functional disability in cognitively impaired HIV+ individuals can be attributed 
to strictly physical causes.
