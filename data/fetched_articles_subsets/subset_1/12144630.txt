We have identified a new HLA-B*15 allele and a new HLA-DRB1*12 allele, named 
B*1568 and DRB1*1208, respectively. The alleles were identified using a 
combination of sequence specific primers, reverse line sequence specific 
oligonucleotide probing and sequence-based typing. Both alleles were identified 
in a single individual of Korean origin. HLA-B*1568 appears to be an 
HLA-B*4801/B*1507 hybrid combining the exon 2 sequence of B*4801 and the exon 3 
and 4 sequences of B*1507. Exon 2 of DRB1*1208 was most similar to DRB1*1201 or 
1206, with a single mismatch at nucleotide position 165 (A to C). At the protein 
level, this substitution results in a phenylalanine substitution at position 26 
that creates an identical amino acid sequence to DRB3*0202 between amino acid 
positions 17 and 36.
