Sotos syndrome (SS), the most common overgrowth with intellectual disability 
(OGID) disorder, is caused by inactivating germline mutations of NSD1, which 
encodes a histone H3 lysine 36 methyltransferase. To understand how NSD1 
inactivation deregulates transcription and DNA methylation (DNAm), and to 
explore how these abnormalities affect human development, we profiled 
transcription and DNAm in SS patients and healthy control individuals. We 
identified a transcriptional signature that distinguishes individuals with SS 
from controls and was also deregulated in NSD1-mutated cancers. Most abnormally 
expressed genes displayed reduced expression in SS; these downregulated genes 
consisted mostly of bivalent genes and were enriched for regulators of 
development and neural synapse function. DNA hypomethylation was strongly 
enriched within promoters of transcriptionally deregulated genes: overexpressed 
genes displayed hypomethylation at their transcription start sites while 
underexpressed genes featured hypomethylation at polycomb binding sites within 
their promoter CpG island shores. SS patients featured accelerated molecular 
aging at the levels of both transcription and DNAm. Overall, these findings 
indicate that NSD1-deposited H3K36 methylation regulates transcription by 
directing promoter DNA methylation, partially by repressing polycomb repressive 
complex 2 (PRC2) activity. These findings could explain the phenotypic 
similarity of SS to OGID disorders that are caused by mutations in PRC2 
complex-encoding genes.
