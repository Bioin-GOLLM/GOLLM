AIM: We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of blood ketone measurement and 
to test the performance of the diagnostic criteria for diabetic ketoacidosis 
(DKA) issued by the American Diabetes Association, the Joint British Diabetes 
Societies, and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the 
American College of Endocrinology.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 278 patients with suspected DKA 
who were hospitalized at 4 university hospitals and aged ≥16 years with a blood 
glucose level of >200 mg/dL and a blood ketone level of ≥1.0 mmol/L as well as 
other biochemical data. The patients were categorized into four subgroups 
(ketosis, typical DKA, atypical DKA, and DKA + lactic acidosis). Atypical DKA in 
each analysis was defined by our supplementary criteria if the biochemical data 
did not meet each set of diagnostic criteria from the aforementioned societies.
RESULTS: Blood ketone levels in patients with diabetic ketosis and those with 
DKA varied widely, 1.05-5.13 mmol/L and 1.02-15.9 mmol/L, respectively. 
Additionally, there were significant discrepancies between the guidelines in the 
diagnosis of DKA. Thus, the proportion of patients with atypical DKA ranged from 
16.5% to 42.4%. Notably, the in-hospital mortality was comparable between 
patients with typical and atypical DKA, with a very high mortality in patients 
with DKA + lactic acidosis (blood lactate >5 mmol/L).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that considering variable presentations of DKA, 
blood ketone data need to be interpreted cautiously along with other biochemical 
data and suggested that a new system is required to better characterize DKA.
