To elucidate hydroxyapatite-protein interaction, mutant human lysozymes in which 
the surface charge was modified by site-directed mutagenesis were used. Five 
mutant human lysozymes (K1A, K13A, K33A, R10A, R14A) were expressed in yeast. 
The chromatographic behavior of these lysozymes was studied with a HPLC 
hydroxyapatite column. Elution molarities of K1A and R14A mutants were greatly 
lowered. While Lys-13 and Arg-10 are located around Lys-1 and Arg-14, K13A and 
R10A mutants bound onto hydroxyapatite stronger than K1A and R14A mutants. In 
combination with an X-ray crystal structure of human lysozyme, it is concluded 
that the adsorbing site of human lysozyme is at the back of the active site and 
that Arg-14, Lys-1, Arg-10 and Lys-13 play important roles in binding.
