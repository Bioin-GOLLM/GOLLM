PURPOSE: To evaluate whether immunomodulation can eliminate high sustained 
antibody levels, and thereby improve clinical outcome in classic infantile Pompe 
patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human 
alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA).
METHODS: Three patients (two cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) 
negative) with high sustained antibodies received a three-week treatment 
protocol with Rituximab and Bortezomib, followed by daily Rapamycin and monthly 
IVIG. Patients received 40 mg/kg/week rhGAA. Antibody titers were measured using 
ELISA. Neutralizing effects on cellular uptake were determined. Clinical 
efficacy was measured in terms of (ventilator-free) survival, reduction in left 
ventricular mass index (LVMI) and improvement in motor function.
RESULTS: Before immunomodulation anti-rhGAA antibody titers ranged from 
1:156,250 to 1:781,250 and at last assessment from 1:31,250 to 1:156,250. 
Neutralizing effects of anti-rhGAA antibody titers (observed in two patients) 
disappeared. Infusion-associated reactions were no longer present. 
Immunomodulation resulted in substantial increases of aspartate transaminase, 
alanine transaminase, and creatine kinase levels. The two CRIM-negative patients 
who could walk at start of immunomodulation maintained their ability to walk; 
the patient who had lost this ability did not regain it.
CONCLUSIONS: To some extent, the immunomodulation protocol used in our study 
reduced antibody titers, but it did not eliminate them. Overall, there have been 
few reports on secondary immunomodulation, and various protocols have been 
applied. Future research should seek to identify the most successful 
immunomodulation protocol in patients with high sustained titers.
