Melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) is the receptor for the pituitary hormone ACTH. 
When activated, MC2R stimulates cAMP production and adrenal steroidogenesis. The 
functional expression of the receptor requires melanocortin 2 receptor accessory 
protein (MRAP), a single-transmembrane domain protein involved in the 
trafficking of MC2R from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. 
Mutations in both MC2R and MRAP cause the inherited disease familial 
glucocorticoid deficiency. At present, little is known regarding the mechanism 
of MRAP in MC2R functional expression. Here we report the characterization of 
MRAP in the trafficking of MC2R to the cell surface and the formation of a 
functional receptor. We identify the transmembrane domain of MRAP as the MC2R 
interaction domain and a conserved N-terminal tyrosine-rich domain of MRAP that 
is required for trafficking MC2R to the cell surface.
