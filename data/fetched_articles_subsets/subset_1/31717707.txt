Conservation initiatives are now more crucial than ever-over a million plant and 
animal species are at risk of extinction over the coming decades. The genetic 
management of threatened species held in insurance programs is recommended; 
however, few are taking advantage of the full range of genomic technologies 
available today. Less than 1% of the 13505 species currently listed as threated 
by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) have a published 
genome. While there has been much discussion in the literature about the 
importance of genomics for conservation, there are limited examples of how 
having a reference genome has changed conservation management practice. The 
Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), is an endangered Australian marsupial, 
threatened by an infectious clonal cancer devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). 
Populations have declined by 80% since the disease was first recorded in 1996. A 
reference genome for this species was published in 2012 and has been crucial for 
understanding DFTD and the management of the species in the wild. Here we use 
the Tasmanian devil as an example of how a reference genome has influenced 
management actions in the conservation of a species.
