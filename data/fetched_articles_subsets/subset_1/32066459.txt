BACKGROUND: NGS from plasma samples in non-squamous cell lung carcinoma (NSCC) 
can aid in the detection of actionable genomic alterations. However, the 
absolute clinical value of NGS in liquid biopsy (LB) made at baseline is 
currently uncertain. We assessed the impact of plasma-based NGS using an 
in-house test and an outsourced test in comparison to a routine molecular 
pathology workflow.
METHODS: Twenty-four advanced/metastatic treatment-naïve NSCC patients were 
prospectively included. NGS analyses were conducted both in-house using the 
Oncomine cfTNA Panel and in an external testing center using the Foundation 
Liquid assay. NGS analysis and/or specific molecular based assays were conducted 
in parallel on tissue or cytological samples.
RESULTS: Both LB tests were well correlated. Tissue NGS results were obtained in 
67% of patients and demonstrated good correlation with LB assays. Activating 
EGFR mutations were detected using LB tests in three patients. PD-L1 expression 
assessed in tissue sections enabled the initiation of pembrolizumab treatment in 
five patients.
CONCLUSION: NGS from LB is feasible in routine clinical practice using an 
in-house or an outsourced test at baseline. However, the impact on therapy 
selection was limited in this small series of patients and LB was not able to 
replace tissue-based testing in our hands.
