These guidelines for the management of patients up to 18 years with Langerhans 
cell histiocytosis (LCH) have been set up by a group of experts involved in the 
Euro Histio Net project who participated in national or international studies 
and in peer reviewed publications. Existing guidelines were reviewed and changed 
where new evidence was available in the literature up to 2012. Data and 
publications have been ranked according to evidence based medicine and when 
there was a lack of published data, consensus between experts was sought. 
Guidelines for diagnosis, initial clinical work-up, and treatment and long-term 
follow-up of LCH patients are presented.
