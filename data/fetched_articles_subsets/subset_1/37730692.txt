The impact of genetic ablation of SOS1 or SOS2 is evaluated in a murine model of 
KRASG12D-driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). SOS2 ablation shows some protection 
during early stages but only SOS1 ablation causes significant, specific long 
term increase of survival/lifespan of the KRASG12D mice associated to markedly 
reduced tumor burden and reduced populations of cancer-associated fibroblasts, 
macrophages and T-lymphocytes in the lung tumor microenvironment (TME). SOS1 
ablation also causes specific shrinkage and regression of LUAD tumoral masses 
and components of the TME in pre-established KRASG12D LUAD tumors. The critical 
requirement of SOS1 for KRASG12D-driven LUAD is further confirmed by means of 
intravenous tail injection of KRASG12D tumor cells into SOS1KO/KRASWT mice, or 
of SOS1-less, KRASG12D tumor cells into wildtype mice. In silico analyses of 
human lung cancer databases support also the dominant role of SOS1 regarding 
tumor development and survival in LUAD patients. Our data indicate that SOS1 is 
critically required for development of KRASG12D-driven LUAD and confirm the 
validity of this RAS-GEF activator as an actionable therapeutic target in KRAS 
mutant LUAD.
