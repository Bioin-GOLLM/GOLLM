The objective of this study was to use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to screen 
for genes encoding for antibiotic resistance, fitness and virulence in 
Cronobacter sakazakii strains that had been isolated from food and 
powdered-milk-producing environments. Virulence (VGs) and antibiotic-resistance 
genes (ARGs) were detected with the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database 
(CARD) platform, ResFinder and PlasmidFinder tools. Susceptibility testing was 
performed using disk diffusion. Fifteen presumptive strains of Cronobacter spp. 
were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and ribosomal-MLST. Nine C. sakazakii strains 
were found in the meningitic pathovar ST4: two were ST83 and one was ST1. The C. 
sakazakii ST4 strains were further distinguished using core genome MLST based on 
3678 loci. Almost all (93%) strains were resistant to cephalotin and 33% were 
resistant to ampicillin. In addition, 20 ARGs, mainly involved in regulatory and 
efflux antibiotics, were detected. Ninety-nine VGs were detected that encoded 
for OmpA, siderophores and genes involved in metabolism and stress. The IncFIB 
(pCTU3) plasmid was detected, and the prevalent mobile genetic elements (MGEs) 
were ISEsa1, ISEc52 and ISEhe3. The C. sakazakii isolates analyzed in this study 
harbored ARGs and VGs, which could have contributed to their persistence in 
powdered-milk-producing environments, and increase the risk of infection in 
susceptible population groups.
