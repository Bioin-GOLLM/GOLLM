As the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus infections is of worldwide concern, 
phenotype and genotype in prevalent MRSA strains require longitudinal 
investigation. In this study, the antibiotic resistance, virulence gene 
acquisition, and molecular type were determined on a large scale of nosocomial 
S. aureus strains in Southern China during 2009-2015. Bacterial identification 
and antimicrobial susceptibility to 10 antibiotics were tested by Vitek-2. 
Virulence genes encoding staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEA, SEB, SEC, SED, and 
SEE), exfoliative toxins (ETA and ETB), Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), and 
toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) were detected by PCR, with SCCmec typing also 
conducted by multiplex PCR strategy. Genotypes were discriminated by MLST and 
spaA typing. MLST was performed by amplification of the internal region of seven 
housekeeping genes. PCR amplification targeting the spa gene was performed for 
spa typing. No resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin and increase 
in the resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (55.5%) were identified. A 
total of nine SCCmec types and subtypes, thirteen STs clustered into thirteen 
spa types were identified, with ST239-SCCmec III-t037 presenting the predominant 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) clone. Typically, SCCmec type IX and 
ST546 were emergent types in China. Isolates positive for both pvl and tsst 
genes and for both eta and etb genes were also identified. Important findings in 
this study include: firstly, we have provided comprehensive knowledge on the 
molecular epidemiology of MRSA in Southern China which fills the gap since 2006 
or 2010 from previous studies. Secondly, we have presented the correlation 
between virulence factors (four major groups) and genotypes (SCCmec, ST and spa 
types). Thirdly, we have shown evidence for earliest emergence of type I SCCmec 
from 2012, type VI from 2009 and type XI from 2012 in MRSA from Southern China.
