The discovery of the neuronal expression of the serine protease tissue-type 
plasminogen activator (tPA) has opened new avenues of research, with important 
implications in the physiopathology of the central nervous system. For example, 
the interaction of tPA with synaptic receptors (NMDAR, LRP1, Annexin II, and 
EGFR) and its role in the maturation of BDNF have been reported to influence 
synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. However, the mechanisms regulating 
the neuronal trafficking of tPA are unknown. Here, using high-resolution live 
cell imaging and a panel of innovative genetic approaches, we first unmasked the 
dynamic characteristics of the dendritic and axonal trafficking of 
tPA-containing vesicles under different paradigms of neuronal activation or 
inhibition. We then report a constitutive exocytosis of tPA- and VAMP2-positive 
vesicles, dramatically increased in conditions of neuronal activation, with a 
pattern which was mainly dendritic and thus post-synaptic. We also observed that 
the synaptic release of tPA led to an increase of the exocytosis of VGlut1 
positive vesicles containing glutamate. Finally, we described alterations of the 
trafficking and exocytosis of neuronal tPA in cultured cortical neurons prepared 
from tau-22 transgenic mice (a preclinical model of Alzheimer's disease (AD)). 
Altogether, these data provide new insights about the neuronal trafficking of 
tPA, contributing to a better knowledge of the tPA-dependent brain functions and 
dysfunctions.
