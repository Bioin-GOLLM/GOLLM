A vaccine to prevent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is urgently needed for 
use alongside direct-acting antiviral drugs to achieve elimination targets. We 
have previously shown that a soluble recombinant form of the glycoprotein E2 
ectodomain (residues 384 to 661) that lacks three variable regions (Δ123) is 
able to elicit a higher titer of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) than 
the parental form (receptor-binding domain [RBD]). In this study, we engineered 
a viral nanoparticle that displays HCV glycoprotein E2 on a duck hepatitis B 
virus (DHBV) small surface antigen (S) scaffold. Four variants of E2-S 
virus-like particles (VLPs) were constructed: Δ123-S, RBD-S, Δ123A7-S, and 
RBDA7-S; in the last two, 7 cysteines were replaced with alanines. While all 
four E2-S variant VLPs display E2 as a surface antigen, the Δ123A7-S and RBDA7-S 
VLPs were the most efficiently secreted from transfected mammalian cells and 
displayed epitopes recognized by cross-genotype broadly neutralizing monoclonal 
antibodies (bNMAbs). Both Δ123A7-S and RBDA7-S VLPs were immunogenic in guinea 
pigs, generating high titers of antibodies reactive to native E2 and able to 
prevent the interaction between E2 and the cellular receptor CD81. Four out of 
eight animals immunized with Δ123A7-S elicited neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), 
with three of those animals generating bNAbs against 7 genotypes. Immune serum 
generated by animals with NAbs mapped to major neutralization epitopes located 
at residues 412 to 420 (epitope I) and antigenic region 3. VLPs that display E2 
glycoproteins represent a promising vaccine platform for HCV and could be 
adapted to large-scale manufacturing in yeast systems. IMPORTANCE There is 
currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C virus infection, which affects more 
than 71 million people globally and is a leading cause of progressive liver 
disease, including cirrhosis and cancer. Broadly neutralizing antibodies that 
recognize the E2 envelope glycoprotein can protect against heterologous viral 
infection and correlate with viral clearance in humans. However, broadly 
neutralizing antibodies are difficult to generate due to conformational 
flexibility of the E2 protein and epitope occlusion. Here, we show that a VLP 
vaccine using the duck hepatitis B virus S antigen fused to HCV glycoprotein E2 
assembles into virus-like particles that display epitopes recognized by broadly 
neutralizing antibodies and elicit such antibodies in guinea pigs. This platform 
represents a novel HCV vaccine candidate amenable to large-scale manufacture at 
low cost.
