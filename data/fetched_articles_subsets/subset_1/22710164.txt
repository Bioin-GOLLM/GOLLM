The ability of modular protein domains to independently fold and bind short 
peptide ligands both in vivo and in vitro has allowed a significant number of 
protein-protein interaction studies to take advantage of them as affinity and 
detection reagents. Here, we refer to modular domain based proteomics as 
"domainomics" to draw attention to the potential of using domains and their 
motifs as tools in proteomics. In this review we describe core concepts of 
domainomics, established and emerging technologies, and recent studies by 
functional category. Accumulation of domain-motif binding data should ultimately 
provide the foundation for domain-specific interactomes, which will likely 
reveal the underlying substructure of protein networks as well as the 
selectivity and plasticity of signal transduction.
