We hypothesized that mutations that inactivate phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity 
and lead to increased cAMP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels may be 
associated with prostate cancer (PCa). We sequenced the entire PDE coding 
sequences in the DNA of 16 biopsy samples from PCa patients. Novel mutations 
were confirmed in the somatic or germline state by Sanger sequencing. Data were 
then compared to the 1000 Genome Project. PDE, CREB and pCREB protein expression 
was also studied in all samples, in both normal and abnormal tissue, by 
immunofluorescence. We identified three previously described PDE sequence 
variants that were significantly more frequent in PCa. Four novel sequence 
variations, one each in the PDE4B,PDE6C, PDE7B and PDE10A genes, respectively, 
were also found in the PCa samples. Interestingly, PDE10A and PDE4B novel 
variants that were present in 19 and 6% of the patients were found in the tumor 
tissue only. In patients carrying PDE defects, there was pCREB accumulation 
(P<0.001), and an increase of the pCREB:CREB ratio (patients 0.97±0.03; controls 
0.52±0.03; P-value <0.001) by immunohistochemical analysis. We conclude that PDE 
sequence variants may play a role in the predisposition and/or progression to 
PCa at the germline and/or somatic state respectively.
