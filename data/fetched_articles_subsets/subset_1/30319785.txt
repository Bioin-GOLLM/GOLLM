The title compound, C18H23FO5, was synthesized by reacting diethyl malonate with 
1-(4-fluoro-phen-yl)-3-methyl-but-2-en-1-one. The mol-ecule adopts a loose 
conformation stabilized by weak C-H⋯O and C-H⋯π inter-actions. In the crystal, 
the mol-ecules are joined by C-H⋯O contacts into infinite chains along the 
b-axis direction with a C(6) graph-set motif. Hirshfeld surface analysis and 
fingerprint plots demonstrate the predominance of H⋯H, O⋯H and F⋯H 
inter-molecular inter-actions in the crystal structure.
