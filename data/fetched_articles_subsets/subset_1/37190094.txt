APOBEC3B (A3B) is aberrantly overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers, where 
it associates with advanced disease, poor prognosis, and treatment resistance, 
yet the causes of A3B dysregulation in breast cancer remain unclear. Here, A3B 
mRNA and protein expression levels were quantified in different cell lines and 
breast tumors and related to cell cycle markers using RT-qPCR and multiplex 
immunofluorescence imaging. The inducibility of A3B expression during the cell 
cycle was additionally addressed after cell cycle synchronization with multiple 
methods. First, we found that A3B protein levels within cell lines and tumors 
are heterogeneous and associate strongly with the proliferation marker Cyclin B1 
characteristic of the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Second, in multiple breast 
cancer cell lines with high A3B, expression levels were observed to oscillate 
throughout the cell cycle and again associate with Cyclin B1. Third, induction 
of A3B expression is potently repressed throughout G0/early G1, likely by RB/E2F 
pathway effector proteins. Fourth, in cells with low A3B, induction of A3B 
through the PKC/ncNF-ÎºB pathway occurs predominantly in actively proliferating 
cells and is largely absent in cells arrested in G0. Altogether, these results 
support a model in which dysregulated A3B overexpression in breast cancer is the 
cumulative result of proliferation-associated relief from repression with 
concomitant pathway activation during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.
