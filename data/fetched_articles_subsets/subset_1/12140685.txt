We used PCR amplification of cDNA prepared from skin biopsies to determine the 
nearly full-length, protein-coding sequence of dog TYRP1, and to define sequence 
variants potentially responsible for the B locus. One common variant contained a 
premature stop codon in exon 5 (Q331ter), and the other deleted a proline 
residue in exon 5 (345delP). A third variant in exon 2 (S41C) occurred less 
frequently. We genotyped 43 brown (including brown and white) and 34 black 
(including tricolor, black-and-tan, and black and white) dogs. All 43 of the 
brown group carried two or more of these sequence variants likely to interfere 
with TYRP1 function, whereas 0 of 34 in the black group carried two or more of 
these variants (10 carried one variant). We also genotyped 13 black-nosed and 10 
brown-nosed dogs whose coat color was described as red, yellow, gold, apricot, 
or orange (including various degrees of white). All these dogs were homozygous 
for a R306X MC1R variant shown to be associated with these coat color 
phenotypes. The black or brown nose correlated perfectly with the absence or 
presence of the same three TYRP1 variants described above. TYRP1 was linkage 
mapped to dog chromosome 11, with a SNP in exon 7.
