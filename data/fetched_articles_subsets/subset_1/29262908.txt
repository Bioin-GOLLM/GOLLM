OBJECTIVE: To explore the coexistence of ASXL1 and CALR gene mutations in 
patients with essential thrombocytheima (ET) and with primary 
myelofibrosis(PMF), and to compare the differences of clinical characteristics 
between ET and PMF patients carrying ASXL1 and CALR mutations, and ET and PMF 
patients carrying solitary gene mutation, and ET and PMF patients without any 
mutations.
METHODS: The mutations of ASXL1 gene at exon 12, CALR gene at exon 9 and MPL 
gene at exon 10 in 263 essential ET patients and 29 PMF patients were detected 
by PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. The JAK2V617F 
mutations were used by allele specific PCR detection.
RESULTS: 72.6%(212/292)of patients harbored at least one mutation. The 
incidences of ASXL1 and CALR mutations were 5.8% and 30.5%, respectively. The 
frequencies of JAK2V617F and MPL mutations were 39.0% and 2.4%, respectively. 
5.1%(15/292) of patients had double mutations, including ASXL1 and CALR(n=11), 
ASXL1 and JAK2V617F(n=2), MPL and CALR(n=1) and ASXL1 and MPL(n=1). The 
frequency of concurrent ASXL1 and CALR mutations was found to be high. 
Significant difference was found on hemoglobin levels and platelet counts 
between CALR and ASXL1 mutations and single mutation (P<0.05),however, the 
difference on leukocyte counts and median age was not found. Compared with 
negative patients, the presence of ASXL1 and CALR mutations was found to be 
significantly correlative with lower hemoglobin level (P=0.045), lower leukocyte 
count (P=0.002) and with higher platelet counts(P=0.001), but the difference of 
median age was not found.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of concurrent ASXL1 and CALR mutations is higher in ET 
patients. The coexistence of ASXL1 and CALR gene mutations significantly 
associated with lower hemoglobin level and higher platelet count.
