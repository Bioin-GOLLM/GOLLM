Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of severe pneumonia. Multiple mechanisms 
of proinflammatory signaling are activated to recruit immune cells into the 
airway in response to S. aureus. We found that interleukin-16 (IL-16), a T cell 
cytokine that binds CD4, is potently activated by S. aureus, specifically by 
protein A (SpA), and to a much greater extent than by Gram-negative pathogens or 
lipopolysaccharide. IL-16 production involved multiple signals including 
ligation of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family members or epidermal 
growth factor receptor, both receptors for SpA and generation of Ca(2+) fluxes 
to activate calpains and caspase-3. Although human airway epithelial cells, 
vascular endothelial cells, THP-1 and Jurkat T cells released IL-16 in response 
to S. aureus in vitro, in a murine model of pneumonia, CD4(+) cells were the 
major source of IL-16 suggesting the involvement of an autocrine signaling 
pathway. The production of IL-16 contributed to lung damage as neutralization of 
IL-16 enhanced S. aureus clearance and resulted in diminished lung pathology in 
S. aureus pneumonia. Our results suggest that the ability of S. aureus to 
activate TNFR1 and Ca(2+)/calpain signaling contribute to T cell activation and 
excessive inflammation in the setting of acute pneumonia.
