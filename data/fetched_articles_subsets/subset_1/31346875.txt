We present the results of analysis of skin epidermis thickness in individuals 
with recessive mutation c.-23+1G>A in the GJB2 gene in comparison with 
individuals without this mutation living in Eastern Siberia (Yakut population). 
We examined 152 individuals with different genotypes by GJB2 gene mutation 
c.-23+1G>A. Homozygotes and heterozygotes by c.-23+1G>A have thicker epidermal 
layer (0.245 mm and 0.269 mm, respectively) in comparison with individuals 
without this mutation (0.193 mm) (p<0.05). The obtained data support the 
hypothesis about selective advantage of carriers of mutant GJB2 gene alleles and 
partly explain extremely high carrier frequency (10.3%) of c.-23+1G>A mutation 
in the GJB2 gene in Yakut population in Eastern Siberia.
