Extensive migration has led to the necessity of knowledge regarding the 
treatment of migrants with different ethnical backgrounds. This is especially 
relevant for pharmacological treatment, because of the significant variation 
between migrant groups in their capacity to metabolize drugs. For psychiatric 
medications, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes are clinically relevant. The aim of this 
meta-analysis was to analyze studies reporting clinically useful information 
regarding CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotype frequencies, across populations and ethnic 
groups worldwide. To that end, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis using 
Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (>336,000 subjects, 318 reports). A 
non-normal metabolizer (non-NM) probability estimate was introduced as the 
equivalent of the sum-prevalence of predicted poor, intermediate, and ultrarapid 
metabolizer CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 phenotypes. The probability of having a CYP2D6 
non-NM predicted phenotype was highest in Algeria (61%) and lowest in Gambia 
(2.7%) while the probability for CYP2C19 was highest in India (80%) and lowest 
in countries in the Americas, particularly Mexico (32%). The mean total 
probability estimates of having a non-NM predicted phenotype worldwide were 
36.4% and 61.9% for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, respectively. We provide detailed tables 
and world maps summarizing clinically relevant data regarding the prevalence of 
CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 predicted phenotypes and demonstrating large inter-ethnic 
differences. Based on the documented probability estimates, pre-emptive 
pharmacogenetic testing is encouraged for every patient who will undergo therapy 
with a drug(s) that is metabolized by CYP2D6 and/or CYP2C19 pathways and should 
be considered in case of treatment resistance or serious side effects.
