Insulin is a critical signaling molecule in reducing blood glucose levels, and 
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is an essential enzyme in regulating glucose 
metabolism. However, the insulin effect on PDH function has not been well 
established. We observed that insulin attenuated the phosphorylation (p) of 
Ser264 (p-Ser264) in the PDH E1α subunit (PDHA1) in normal rat hepatocyte. In 
contrast, insulin induced an increase of p-Ser264 PDHA1 levels in hepatocellular 
carcinoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells. Insulin activated RhoA and Rho-dependent coiled 
coil kinase, an effector protein of active RhoA, which regulated p-Ser264 PDHA1 
levels, along with both p-Ser9 and p-Tyr216 forms of glycogen synthase kinase-3β 
(GSK-3β) in HepG2 cells. Only p-Tyr216 GSK-3β, the active form was involved in 
an increase of p-Ser264 PDHA1. Akt was also engaged in p-Ser9 of GSK-3β, but 
neither in p-Tyr216 of GSK-3β nor p-Ser264 of PDHA1 upon insulin. Reconstituted 
dephospho-mimic forms PDHA1 S264A and GSK-3β Y216F impaired, but wild-types 
PDHA1 and GSK-3β and phospho-mimic forms PDHA1 S264D and GSK-3β Y216E increased 
cell proliferation upon insulin through expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1. 
Therefore, we propose that insulin-mediated p-PDHA1 is involved in the 
regulation of HepG2 cell proliferation through RhoA signaling pathway.-Islam,
