T cells are key players of the mammalian adaptive immune system. They experience 
different mechanical microenvironments during their life cycle, from the thymus, 
secondary lymph organs, and peripheral tissues that are free of externally 
applied force, but display variable substrate rigidities to the blood and 
lymphatic circulation systems, where complicated hydrodynamic forces are 
present. Regardless of whether T cells are subject to external forces or 
generate their own internal forces, they respond and adapt to different 
biomechanical cues to modulate their adhesion, migration, trafficking, and 
triggering of immune functions through mechanical regulation of various 
molecules that bear force. These include adhesive receptors, immunoreceptors, 
motor proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and their associated molecules. Here, we 
discuss the forces acting on various surface and cytoplasmic proteins of a T 
cell in different mechanical milieus. We review existing data on how force 
regulates protein conformational changes and interactions with counter 
molecules, including integrins, actin, and the T-cell receptor, and how each 
relates to T-cell functions.
