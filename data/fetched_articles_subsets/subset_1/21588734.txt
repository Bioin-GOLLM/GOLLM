In the title compound, C(19)H(19)N(3)OS(2), the thio-pyran ring adopts a 
twist-chair conformation and the pyrimidinone unit is essentially planar, with a 
mean deviation of 0.0497 Å. The thio-phene ring is essentially planar with a 
maximum deviation of 0.024 (2) Å, while the pyrrolidine ring exhibits an 
envelope conformation. The pyrimidinone and thio-phene rings are almost 
coplanar, forming a dihedral angle of 6.31 (15)°, while the dihedral angle 
between the mean planes of the phenyl ring and the pyrimidinone ring is 
68.13 (10)°. In the crystal structure, adjacent mol-ecules are linked by C-H⋯O 
hydrogen bonds, forming a two-dimensional network in the ac plane.
