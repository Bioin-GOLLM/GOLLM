Venous thrombosis is a common problem, predominantly afflicting people of 
European origin. This European predisposition has been explained to some extent 
by the recent characterization of factor V Leiden, and the G20210A prothrombin 
variant. Although it is clear that factor V Leiden is largely confined to 
Europeans, the world distribution of the prothrombin variant is not known. We 
have analysed samples from 22 different non-European countries and shown that 
this prothrombin variant is very rare outside Europe: one case occurring in 
India. The reason for the confined distribution of these two mutations is 
unclear.
