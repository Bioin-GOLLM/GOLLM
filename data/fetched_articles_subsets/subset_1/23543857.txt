STUDY BACKGROUND: DEFB4/103A encoding β-defensin 2 and 3, respectively, inhibit 
CXCR4-tropic (X4) viruses in vitro. We determined whether DEFB4/103A Copy Number 
Variation (CNV) influences time-to-X4 and time-to-AIDS outcomes.
METHODS: We utilized samples from a previously published Multicenter AIDS Cohort 
Study (MACS), which provides longitudinal account of viral tropism in relation 
to the full spectrum of rates of disease progression. Using traditional models 
for time-to-event analysis, we investigated association between DEFB4/103A CNV 
and the two outcomes, and interaction between DEFB4/103A CNV and disease 
progression groups, Fast and Slow.
RESULTS: Time-to-X4 and time-to-AIDS were weakly correlated. There was a 
stronger relationship between these two outcomes for the fast progressors. 
DEFB4/103A CNV was associated with time-to-AIDS, but not time-to-X4. The 
association between higher DEFB4/103A CNV and time-to-AIDS was more pronounced 
for the slow progressors.
CONCLUSION: DEFB4/103A CNV was associated with time-to-AIDS in a disease 
progression group-specific manner in the MACS cohort. Our findings may 
contribute to enhancing current understanding of how genetic predisposition 
influences AIDS progression.
