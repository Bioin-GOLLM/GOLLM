As human Tau undergoes pathologically relevant post-translational modifications 
when expressed in yeast, the use of humanized yeast models for the generation of 
novel Tau monoclonal antibodies has previously been proven to be successful. In 
this study, human Tau2N4R-ΔK280 purified from yeast was used for the 
immunization of mice and subsequent selection of high affinity Tau-specific 
monoclonal antibodies. The characterization of four novel antibodies in 
different Tau model systems yielded a phosphorylation-dependent antibody 
(15A10), an antibody directed to the first microtubule-binding repeat domain 
(16B12), a carboxy-terminal antibody (20G10) and an antibody targeting an 
epitope on the hinge of the first and second amino-terminal insert (18F12). The 
latter was found to be conformation-dependent, suggesting structural differences 
between the Tau splicing isoforms and allowing insight in the roles played by 
the amino-terminal inserts. As this monoclonal antibody also has the capacity to 
detect tangle-like structures in different transgenic Tau mice and 
neurofibrillary tangles in brain sections of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's 
disease, we also tested the diagnostic potential of 18F12 in a pilot study and 
found this monoclonal antibody to have the ability to discriminate Alzheimer's 
disease patients from control individuals based on increased Tau levels in the 
cerebrospinal fluid.
