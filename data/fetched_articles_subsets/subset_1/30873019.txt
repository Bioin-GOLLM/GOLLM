Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation contributes to multiple neurodegenerative 
disorders, including PD. Therefore, the regulation of microglial activation 
probably has the therapeutic potential. This study is aimed to determine whether 
NBP could suppress microglial activation and protect dopaminergic neurons from 
excessive neuroinflammation. In the present study, MPTP-induced PD model was 
established to explore the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effect of NBP. 
We assessed motor deficits, dopaminergic neurodegeneration and microglial 
activation in PD mice. In vitro, the anti-inflammatory activity of NBP was 
confirmed by cell viability assay of SH-SY5Y cells after being treated with 
conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells and from 
1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+)-stimulated BV-2 cells. The expression 
of pro-inflammatory molecules was determined by RT-PCR, Western Blot and ELISA 
assay. The generation of NO and ROS were also assessed. The involvement of 
signaling pathways such as MAPK, NF-κB, and PI3k/Akt were further investigated 
by Western Blot and immunofluorescence assay. The neuroprotective effect of NBP 
was demonstrated in vivo as shown by the improvement of dopaminergic 
neurodegeneration, motor deficits and microglial activation in MPTP-induced 
mouse model of PD. The expression of pro-inflammatory mediators was also reduced 
by NBP administration. In vitro, NBP also protected dopaminergic neurons from 
neurotoxicity induced by activated microglia. NBP pretreatment not only reduced 
pro-inflammatory molecules, but also suppressed NO release and ROS generation in 
BV-2 cells. Further mechanism research suggested that the inactivation of MAPK, 
NF-κB and PI3K/Akt may involve in anti-neuroinflammation role of NBP. In 
conclusion, our results revealed that NBP exerted dopaminergic neuroprotection 
through inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, suggesting the 
promising therapeutic effect of NBP for PD.
