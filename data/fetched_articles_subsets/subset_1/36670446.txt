BACKGROUND: Cellular communication network factor 3 (CCN3) has been implicated 
in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. However, it is not known if 
CCN3 can regulate valvular calcification. While macrophages have been shown to 
regulate valvular calcification, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this 
process remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the role 
of macrophage-derived CCN3 in the progression of calcific aortic valve disease.
METHODS: Myeloid-specific knockout of CCN3 (Mye-CCN3-KO) and control mice were 
subjected to a single tail intravenous injection of AAV encoding mutant mPCSK9 
(rAAV8/D377Y-mPCSK9) to induce hyperlipidemia. AAV-injected mice were then fed a 
high fat diet for 40 weeks. At the conclusion of high fat diet feeding, tissues 
were harvested and subjected to histologic and pathologic analyses. In vitro, 
bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were obtained from Mye-CCN3-KO and 
control mice and the expression of bone morphogenic protein signaling related 
gene were verified via quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. The BMDM 
conditioned medium was cocultured with human valvular intersititial cells which 
was artificially induced calcification to test the effect of the conditioned 
medium via Western blotting and Alizarin red staining.
RESULTS: Echocardiography revealed that both male and female Mye-CCN3-KO mice 
displayed compromised aortic valvular function accompanied by exacerbated valve 
thickness and cardiac dysfunction. Histologically, Alizarin-Red staining 
revealed a marked increase in aortic valve calcification in Mye-CCN3-KO mice 
when compared to the controls. In vitro, CCN3 deficiency augmented BMP2 
production and secretion from bone marrow-derived macrophages. In addition, 
human valvular interstitial cells cultured with conditioned media from 
CCN3-deficient BMDMs resulted in exaggerated pro-calcifying gene expression and 
the consequent calcification.
CONCLUSION: Our data uncovered a novel role of myeloid CCN3 in the regulation of 
aortic valve calcification. Modulation of BMP2 production and secretion in 
macrophages might serve as a key mechanism for macrophage-derived CCN3's 
anti-calcification function in the development of CAVD. Video Abstract.
