MicroRNA research in humans and mammalian model organisms is in a crucial stage 
of development. Diagnostic and therapeutic values of microRNAs appear promising, 
but remain to be established. The physiological and pathophysiological 
significance of microRNAs is generally recognized, but much better understood in 
some organ systems and disease areas than others. In the present paper, we 
review several translational studies of microRNAs, including those showing the 
potential value of therapeutic agents targeting microRNAs and diagnostic or 
prognostic microRNA markers detectable in body fluids. We discuss the lessons 
learned and the experience gained from these studies. Several recent studies 
have begun to explore translational microRNA research in kidney disease and 
hypertension. Translational research of microRNAs in the kidney faces unique 
challenges, but provides many opportunities to develop and apply new methods, 
and to merge complementary basic and clinical approaches.
