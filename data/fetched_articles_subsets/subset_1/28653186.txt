Viruses of the Ebolavirus genus cause sporadic epidemics of severe and systemic 
febrile disease that are fueled by human-to-human transmission. Despite the 
notoriety of ebolaviruses, particularly Ebola virus (EBOV), as prominent viral 
hemorrhagic fever agents, and the international concern regarding Ebola virus 
disease (EVD) outbreaks, very little is known about the pathophysiology of EVD 
in humans and, in particular, about the human immune correlates of survival and 
immune memory. This lack of basic knowledge about physiological characteristics 
of EVD is probably attributable to the dearth of clinical and laboratory data 
gathered from past outbreaks. The unprecedented magnitude of the EVD epidemic 
that occurred in West Africa from 2013 to 2016 has allowed, for the first time, 
evaluation of clinical, epidemiological, and immunological parameters in a 
significant number of patients using state-of-the-art laboratory equipment. This 
review will summarize the data from the literature regarding human 
pathophysiologic and immunologic responses to filoviral infection.
