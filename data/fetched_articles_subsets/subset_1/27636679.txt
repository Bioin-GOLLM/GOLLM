BACKGROUND: In this study, we explored the association between the dietary 
inflammatory index (DII) and gastric cancer risk in an Italian case-control 
study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases were 230 patients with incident, histologically 
confirmed cases of gastric cancer from the Greater Milan area, Northern Italy. 
Controls were 547 frequency-matched subjects admitted to the same network of 
hospitals as cases for a wide spectrum of acute, non-neoplastic conditions. The 
DII was computed using a reproducible and valid 78-item food frequency 
questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated through logistic regression 
models conditioned on age and sex and adjusted for recognized confounding 
factors, including total energy intake.
RESULTS: Subjects with the most pro-inflammatory diet had a higher risk of 
gastric cancer compared to subjects with the most anti-inflammatory diet 
(ORQuartile4vs1 = 2.35, 95% confidence interval, 1.32, 4.20; P-trend = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that a pro-inflammatory diet, as indicated by 
higher DII score, was associated with increased risk of gastric cancer.
