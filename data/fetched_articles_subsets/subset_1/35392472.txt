A great number of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience 
olfactory dysfunction, typically of a short duration and with a high incidence 
rate, during the early stages of infection with severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This kind of olfactory dysfunction appears 
more likely in young people and women. This study presents a review of the 
clinical features and pathogenic mechanism of the olfactory dysfunction related 
to SARS-CoV-2 infection, aiming to provide a clinical reference for the 
diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of olfactory 
dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
