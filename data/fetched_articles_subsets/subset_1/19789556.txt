DNA methylation patterns are set up early in mammalian development and are then 
copied during the division of somatic cells. A long-established model for the 
maintenance of these patterns explains some, but not all, of the data that are 
now available. We propose a new model that suggests that the maintenance of DNA 
methylation relies not only on the recognition of hemimethylated DNA by DNA 
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) but also on the localization of the DNMT3A and 
DNMT3B enzymes to specific chromatin regions that contain methylated DNA.
