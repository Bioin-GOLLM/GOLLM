Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative dysfunction characterized 
by the loss of pigmented dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal system with a 
consequent dopamine decrease. The reduction of dopamine levels produces neuronal 
damage, depigmentation of the substantia nigra, and the presence of 
intracellular inclusions in dopaminergic neurons. Treatments for Parkinson's 
disease aim for improving these motor symptoms by increasing the dopaminergic 
signal in the striatum with levodopa in combination with enzyme inhibitors or 
anticholinergic drugs. Nevertheless, natural products can act as neuroprotective 
agents by reducing the progression of the disease and the inflammatory 
process.In the present review, we have compiled data on the principal medicinal 
plants and natural products as potential antiparkinsonian agents. They act by 
different mechanisms, such as the inhibition of α-synuclein condensation, 
reduction of oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation, increase of dopaminergic 
neurons survival, or the blockade of the A2 A receptor.
