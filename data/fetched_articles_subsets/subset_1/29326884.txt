BACKGROUND: Periocular melanoma is a rare but often deadly malignancy that 
arises in the uvea (commonest origin), conjunctiva or orbit (rarest primary 
site). Melanoma accounts for 5-10% of metastatic/secondary orbital malignancies, 
but only a tiny proportion of primary orbital neoplasia. Primary orbital 
melanoma (POM) is exceedingly rare, with approximately 50 cases reported to 
date.
METHODS: All patients seen in the orbital unit at a tertiary referral hospital 
(1991-2016) with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of POM were identified from a 
diagnostic database and were studied. The case notes, imaging, surgical 
approach, and histology were reviewed.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients (five male; 38%) presented with isolated malignant 
melanoma of the orbit, for which no other primary site was identified at 
presentation or during an average follow-up of 44 months (median 22; range 
0-13 years). The patients presented between the ages of 40 and 84 years (mean 
55.5; median 48 years) and typically gave a short history of rapidly increasing 
proptosis and eyelid swelling. On the basis of history, a malignant lesion was 
suspected in most patients and all underwent incisional biopsy, with debulking 
of the mass in 10 (77%) patients, and skin-sparing exenteration in 3/13 (23%). 
Ten patients underwent orbital radiotherapy and the survival to date ranged from 
9 months to 14 years (mean 55 months; median 23 months); two patients received 
solely palliative care for widespread disease and one patient refused orbital 
radiotherapy. Five of the 13 (38%) patients died from the disease.
DISCUSSION: POM is a very rare malignancy, but clinical analysis of this cohort 
gives insight into disease presentation and prognosis. The tumor typically 
presents with a rapidly progressive, well-defined mass that is, in some cases, 
amenable to macroscopically intact excision. Unusual for malignant melanoma, 
some of these patients can show an unusually long period of quiescent disease 
after surgical debulking and radiotherapy.
