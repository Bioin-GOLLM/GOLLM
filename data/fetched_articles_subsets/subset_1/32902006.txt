The organometallic AuI bis-N-heterocyclic carbene complex 
[Au(9-methylcaffeine-8-ylidene)2 ]+ (AuTMX2 ) was previously shown to 
selectively and potently stabilise telomeric DNA G-quadruplex (G4) structures. 
This study sheds light on the molecular reactivity and mode of action of AuTMX2 
in the cellular context using mass spectrometry-based methods, including shotgun 
proteomics in A2780 ovarian cancer cells. In contrast to other metal-based 
anticancer agents, this organogold compound is less prone to form coordinative 
bonds with biological nucleophiles and is expected to exert its drug effects 
mainly by non-covalent interactions. Global protein expression changes of 
treated cancer cells revealed a multimodal mode of action of AuTMX2 by 
alterations in the nucleolus, telomeres, actin stress-fibres and 
stress-responses, which were further supported by pharmacological assays, 
fluorescence microscopy and cellular accumulation experiments. Proteomic data 
are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD020560.
