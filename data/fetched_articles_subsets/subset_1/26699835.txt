BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A common polymorphism in the MUC5B gene (rs35705950) 
is associated with susceptibility to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 
familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP). We investigated predisposition of the 
MUC5B polymorphism to fibrotic interstitial pneumonias in Dutch Caucasian 
patient cohorts. Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between MUC5B 
genotype and survival in these cohorts.
METHODS: Sporadic IPF (spIPF, n = 115), FIP (n = 55), idiopathic non-specific 
interstitial pneumonia (iNSIP, n = 43), connective tissue disease associated 
interstitial pneumonia (CTD_IP, n = 35) and a control cohort (n = 249) were 
genotyped for rs35705950.
RESULTS: Rs35705950 minor allele frequency (MAF) in controls was 0.09. 
Case-control analysis showed significant allelic association with spIPF (MAF = 
0.27; P = 5.0 × 10(-10)), FIP (MAF = 0.30; P = 2.7 × 10(-9)) and iNSIP (MAF = 
0.22; P = 3.4 × 10(-4)). No association was observed in CTD_IP (MAF = 0.07). FIP 
subgroup analysis revealed an association between MUC5B and telomerase mutated 
FIP (P = 0.003), and between MUC5B and FIP with unknown genetic cause (P = 1.2 × 
10(-8)). In spIPF carriership of MUC5B minor allele did not influence survival. 
In FIP MUC5B minor allele carriers had better survival (non-carriers 37 vs 
carriers 53 months, P = 0.01). In iNSIP survival analysis showed an opposite 
effect. Worse survival was found in iNSIP patients that carried the MUC5B minor 
allele (non-carriers 118 vs carriers 46 months, P = 0.027) CONCLUSION: This 
study showed that MUC5B minor allele predisposes to spIPF, FIP and iNSIP. In 
spIPF, survival is not influenced by MUC5B alleles. In FIP, MUC5B minor allele 
predicts better survival, pointing towards a subgroup of FIP patients with a 
milder, MUC5B-driven form of pulmonary fibrosis.
