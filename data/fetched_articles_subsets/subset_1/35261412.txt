Temperature is one of the ubiquitous signals that control both the development 
as well as virulence of various microbial species. Therefore their survival is 
dependent upon initiating appropriate response upon temperature fluctuations. In 
particular, pathogenic microbes exploit host-temperature sensing mechanisms for 
triggering the expression of virulence genes. Many studies have revealed that 
the biomolecules within a cell such as DNA, RNA, lipids and proteins help in 
sensing change in temperature, thereby acting as thermosensors. This review 
shall provide an insight into the different mechanisms of thermosensing and how 
they aid pathogenic microbes in host invasion.
