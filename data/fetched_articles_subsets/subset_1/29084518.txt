BACKGROUND: Many published studies have estimated the association between the 
+331G/A (rs10895068) polymorphism in the progesterone receptor (PgR) gene and 
breast cancer risk. However, the results remain inconsistent and controversial. 
To address this inconsistency, we systematically interrogated the aforementioned 
association via a meta-analysis.
METHODS: Through a literature search, we identified 13 case-control studies, 
including 12,453 cases and 14,056 case-free controls. The strengths of reported 
associations were evaluated using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence 
intervals (95%CIs).
RESULTS: An association was found between +331G/A polymorphism and +331G/A risk 
in the dominant model (p = 0.027). Via subgroup analysis, we found no 
association between +331G/A and breast cancer risk in Caucasians, Asians or 
mixed racial groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Through meta-analysis, we were able to gain insight into previously 
reported associations between +331G/A polymorphism and breast cancer risk. 
However, further studies are still needed to provide more evidence.
