We present a case of a 49-year-old male with complaints of back pain and not 
being able to urinate. The patient was suffering from back pain for the last 
four days and followed up with the chiropractor, but the pain persisted. The 
patient took eight ibuprofen tablets (1600 mg) within those four days to relieve 
the pain. Lab workup showed a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 175 mg/dL, creatinine 
level of 32.87mg/dL, and an anion gap metabolic acidosis. With close monitoring 
and dialysis in the hospital, the creatinine came down to 11.92mg/dL. 
Ultrasound-guided renal biopsy showed that the patient developed acute 
interstitial nephritis. The patient was treated with prednisone and later 
discharged with a creatinine level of 8.60mg/dL. Before he was discharged, he 
was declared to have end-stage renal disease and placed on outpatient dialysis. 
Only a few case reports are recorded in the literature with such a high 
elevation of creatinine levels.
