OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation of splicing mutations at the 5' end of the 
DMD gene with their phenotypes.
METHODS: DMD gene mutations were analyzed using Multiplex Ligation Probe 
Amplification (MLPA) and Sanger sequencing. Co-segregation analysis was 
performed for the pedigrees of the probands. Influence of mutations on protein 
function was predicted by bioinformatic analysis.
RESULTS: Three novel splicing mutations were identified in three patients with 
different phenotypes. Patient 1 carried a c.31+3insT mutation and presented 
primarily with dilated cardiomyopathy (XLDC). There was no clinical signs of 
skeletal myopathy. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that the mutation may 
inactivate the splicing donor of intron 1 and lead to premature termination of 
protein translation. Patient 2 carried a c.264_264+4delTGTAA mutation, which led 
to loss of splicing donor site for intron 4, and manifested Becker muscular 
dystrophy (BMD). The mutation was predicted to result in skipping of exon 4. The 
defective protein may still retain most of its function. Patient 3 had Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy (DMD) and carried a c.832-3C>T mutation which was predicted 
to decrease the activity of splicing acceptor of intron 8, resulting in usage of 
alternative acceptor site or retain of intron 8. All related transcripts may 
cause premature termination of protein translation and complete loss of protein 
function. The three mutations were all inherited from the mothers of the 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Three novel splicing mutations were discovered at the 5' end of DMD 
gene in three patients with different disease phenotypes. Our study may 
facilitate understanding of the influence of splicing mutations at the 5' end of 
the DMD gene on dystrophin function and the correlation between genotypes and 
phenotypes.
