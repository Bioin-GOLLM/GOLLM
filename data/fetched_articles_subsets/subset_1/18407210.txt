The ACTH resistance syndromes-familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) and the 
triple-A syndrome-have long been postulated to result from genetic defects of 
the ACTH receptor. We have demonstrated a point mutation that reduced function 
of this receptor in FGD, and subsequently we, and others, have identified other 
mutations of this gene in other families with this condition. Gene linkage 
studies, however, show that the ACTH receptor is not associated with either a 
subgroup o f FGD in which mutations in the ACTH receptor gene cannot be found or 
with the triple-A syndrome. The study of these diseases may reveal new aspects 
of adrenal development and function, and provide insights into the molecular 
mechanisms of ACTH receptor action.
