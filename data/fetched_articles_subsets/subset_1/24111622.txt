An ensemble-based approach is presented to explore the conformational space 
sampled by a multidomain protein showing moderate interdomain dynamics in terms 
of translational and rotational motions. The strategy was applied on a complex 
of calmodulin (CaM) with the IQ-recognition motif from the voltage-gated calcium 
channel Ca(v)1.2 (IQ), which adopts three different interdomain orientations in 
the crystal. The N60D mutant of calmodulin was used to collect pseudocontact 
shifts and paramagnetically induced residual dipolar couplings for six different 
lanthanide ions. Then, starting from the crystal structure, pools of 
conformations were generated by free MD. We found the three crystal 
conformations in solution, but four additional MD-derived conformations had to 
be included into the ensemble to fulfill all the paramagnetic data and 
cross-validate optimally against unused paramagnetic data. Alternative 
approaches led to similar ensembles. Our "ensemble" approach is a simple and 
efficient tool to probe and describe the interdomain dynamics and represents a 
general method that can be used to provide a proper ensemble description of 
multidomain proteins.
