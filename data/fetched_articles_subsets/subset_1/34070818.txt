The short- and long-term consumption of monosodium glutamate (MSG) increases 
urinary pH but the effects on the metabolic pathways in the liver, kidney and 
the gut microbiota remain unknown. To address this issue, we investigated adult 
male Wistar rats allocated to receive drinking water with or without 1 g% MSG 
for 2 weeks (n = 10, each). We performed a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy-based metabolomic study of the jejunum, liver, and kidneys, while 
faecal samples were collected for bacterial DNA extraction to investigate the 
gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We observed significant changes 
in the liver of MSG-treated rats compared to controls in the levels of glucose, 
pyridoxine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, alanine, kynurenate, and nicotinamide. 
Among kidney metabolites, the level of trimethylamine (TMA) was increased, and 
pyridoxine was decreased after MSG-treatment. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene 
revealed that MSG-treated rats had increased Firmicutes, the gut bacteria 
associated with TMA metabolism, along with decreased Bifidobacterium species. 
Our data support the impact of MSG consumption on liver and kidney metabolism. 
Based on the gut microbiome changes, we speculate that TMA and its metabolites 
such as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) may be mediators of the effects of MSG on 
the kidney health.
