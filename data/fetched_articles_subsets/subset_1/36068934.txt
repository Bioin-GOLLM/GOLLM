OBJECTIVE: It is unknown why some athletes develop chondromalacia and others do 
not, even when accounting for similar workloads between individuals. Genetic 
differences between individuals may be a contributing factor. The purpose of 
this work was to screen the entire genome for genetic markers associated with 
chondromalacia.
DESIGN: Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were performed utilizing data 
from the Kaiser Permanente Research Board (KPRB) and the UK Biobank. 
Chondromalacia cases were identified based on electronic health records from 
KPRB and UK Biobank. GWA analyses from both cohorts were tested for 
chondromalacia using a logistic regression model adjusting for sex, height, 
weight, age of enrollment, and race/ethnicity using allele counts for 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The data from the 2 GWA studies (KPRB 
and UK Biobank) were combined in a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: There were a total of 3,872 combined cases of chondromalacia from the 
KPRB and the UK Biobank cohorts. Genome-wide significant associations with 
chondromalacia were found for rs144449054 in the ARHGAP15 gene (OR = 3.70 
[2.32-5.90]; P = 1.4 × 10-8) and rs188900564 in the MAGEC2 (OR = 2.07 
[1.61-2.65]; P = 3.7 × 10-9).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic markers in ARHGAP15 and MAGEC2 appear to be associated with 
chondromalacia and are potential risk factors that deserve further validation 
regarding molecular mechanisms.
