BACKGROUND: Transgenic gpt delta mouse and rat models were developed to perform 
gpt and Spi(-) assays for in vivo mutagenicity tests. The animals were 
established by integration of lambda EG10 phage DNA as a transgene into the 
genome. The inserted position of the transgene on chromosome was determined by 
fluorescent in situ hybridization and Southern blot analyses; however, the exact 
position and sequence of the inserted junction were not known. To identify the 
site and pattern of genomic integration of the transgene copies, genomic DNAs 
extracted from C57BL/6J gpt delta mice and F344 gpt delta rats were applied to 
whole genome sequencing and mate-pair analysis.
RESULTS: The result confirmed that multi-copy lambda EG10 transgenes are 
inserted at a single position in the mouse chromosome 17. The junction contains 
70 bp of overlapped genomic sequences, and it has short homology at both ends. A 
copy number analysis suggested that the inserted transgenes may contain 41 
head-to-tail junctions and 16 junctions of other types such as rearranged 
abnormal junctions. It suggested that the number of intact copies could be 
approximately 40 at maximum. In the F344 gpt delta rats, transgenes are inserted 
at a single position in the rat chromosome 4. The junction contains no 
overlapped sequence but 72-kb genomic sequence including one gene was deleted. 
The inserted transgenes may contain 15 head-to-tail junctions and two rearranged 
junctions. It suggested that the number of intact copies could be 14 at maximum. 
One germline base substitution in the gpt gene rescued from gpt delta rats was 
characterized.
CONCLUSIONS: The exact inserted positions of the lambda EG10 transgene in the 
genome of gpt delta transgenic rodents were identified. The copy number and 
arrangement of the transgene were analyzed. PCR primers for quick genotyping of 
gpt delta mice and rats have been designed.
