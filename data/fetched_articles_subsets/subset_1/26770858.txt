Sweet's syndrome is an inflammatory systemic disease which has been associated 
with various underlying causes. The disease can involve multiple areas of the 
body including the skin and neurological system. There have been only two cases 
which have described otological involvement. This report presents a patient who 
developed loss of hearing secondary to Sweet's syndrome after developing 
cutaneous involvement along with peripheral neuropathy. Despite the patient's 
skin and neuropathy noticing improvement with intravenous immunoglobulin and 
azathioprine, he required bilateral cochlear implants for partial recovery of 
his hearing loss. This case highlights the need to recognize Sweet's syndrome as 
a complicated disease process where the role of otolaryngologists is important 
in the multidisciplinary coordination of care in both diagnosis and treatment.
