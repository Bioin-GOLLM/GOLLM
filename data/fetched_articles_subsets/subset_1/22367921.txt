Sensorimotor gating, or the ability of a sensory event to suppress a motor 
response, can be measured operationally via prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the 
startle response. PPI is deficient in schizophrenia patients as well as other 
neuropsychiatric disorders, can be measured across species, and has been used 
widely as a translational tool in preclinical neuropharmacological and genetic 
research. First developed to assess drug effects in pharmacological and 
developmental models, PPI has become one of the standard behavioral measures in 
genetic models of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders that 
exhibit PPI deficits. In this chapter we review the literature on genetic models 
of sensorimotor gating and discuss the utility of PPI as a tool in phenotyping 
mutant mouse models. We highlight the approaches to genetic mouse models of 
neuropsychiatric disease, discuss some of the important caveats to these 
approaches, and provide a comprehensive table covering the more recent genetic 
models that have evaluated PPI.
