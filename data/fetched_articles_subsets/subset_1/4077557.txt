Homozygosity for the delta-chain variant haemoglobin A2' (HbB2) (delta 16 
Gly----Arg).

Lehmann H, Jenkins T, Plowman D, Nurse GT.

A healthy 20-year-old woman, belonging to the Kgalagadi tribe of Botswana, has 
been found to possess a variant Haemoglobin A2 as her only minor haemoglobin 
component. Fingerprinting and amino-acid analysis have shown that it is 
Haemoglobin A2' (delta 16 Gly----Arg). The one parent available for study is 
heterozygous for the Hb delta A2' allele and the variant haemoglobin accounts 
for 3% of the total haemoglobin in the proband. It is reasoned that the proband 
is, therefore, homozygous for the Hb delta A2' allele. No haematological 
abnormalities were evident.
