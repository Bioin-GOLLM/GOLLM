The aim of the research was to evaluate lactose content and rheological, 
physical, chemical, and organoleptic parameters during the storage of fermented 
beverages made from sheep's milk. The research was carried out on natural, 
probiotic, and Greek-type yogurts, as well as kefir. The products were made 
using the thermostat method from the milk of 42 East Frisian sheep in the middle 
lactation period, in duplicate. Lactose contents, active and titratable acidity, 
color by the L*a*b*C*h* system, and rheological parameters (hardness, 
consistency, consistency, and viscosity) were tested, and organoleptic 
assessments were carried out on the first, seventh, fourteenth, and twenty-first 
days of storing the drinks at 4 °C. Of all drinks, the highest reduction in 
lactose after 21 days of storage was found to occur in kefir (52% reduction) 
and, among the yogurts, in the Greek yogurt (41% reduction). The product with 
the lowest lactose content, regardless of the storage period, was kefir. This 
indicates that kefir is more suitable than yogurt for people with partial 
lactose intolerance. Effects of both inoculation type and beverage storage time 
were shown to exist for all parameters. It was also found that kefirs suffered 
deterioration in most rheological parameters and, in general organoleptic 
evaluation in the final period of storage. Based on our analysis, the optimal 
storage time for natural yogurts and sheep's milk kefirs at 4 °C was 21 and 14 
days, respectively.
