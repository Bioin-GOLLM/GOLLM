BACKGROUND: RING finger protein 43 (RNF43), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a 
homologous gene mutated in several cancers. However, the pan-cancer panoramic 
picture of RNF43 and its predictive value for tumor immune phenotypes and 
immunotherapeutic efficacy are still largely unclear. Our study aims to clarify 
the functions of RNF43 in predicting the prognosis, immune signature, and 
immunotherapeutic efficacy in pan-cancer.
METHODS: By using RNA-seq, mutation, and clinical data from the TCGA database, 
the expression levels and prognostic significance of RNF43 in pan-cancer were 
analyzed. The genetic alteration characteristics of RNF43 were displayed by the 
cBioPortal database. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to 
investigate the potential biological functions and signaling pathways modulated 
by RNF43 in cancers. The relationship of RNF43 expression with immune cell 
infiltration, and immune modulators expression was interpreted by the ESTIMATE 
algorithm, CIBERSORT algorithm, and TISIDB database. The correlations between 
RNF43, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutation burden (TMB) were 
also investigated. Furthermore, the predictive value of RNF43 for 
immunotherapeutic efficacy and drug sensitivity was further illustrated. 
Besides, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to validate the expression of 
the RNF43 in different cancer types by our clinical cohorts, including patients 
with lung cancer, sarcoma, breast cancer, and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that RNF43 was abnormally expressed in 
multiple cancers, and RNF43 is a critical prognosis-related factor in several 
cancers. RNF43 was frequently mutated in several cancers with a high frequency 
of 4%, and truncating mutation was the most frequent RNF43 mutation type. RNF43 
expression was linked to the abundance of several immune cell types, including 
CD8+ T cells, B cells, and macrophages within the tumor immune microenvironment. 
Furthermore, RNF43 expression was significantly correlated with the efficacy of 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, and it could predict the sensitivity of various 
anti-cancer drugs. Finally, IHC explored and validated the different expression 
levels of RNF43 in different cancers by our clinical samples.
CONCLUSION: Our results first present the expression pattern and the mutation 
signature of RNF43, highlighting that RNF43 is an important prognostic biomarker 
in pan-cancer. Furthermore, RNF43 seems to be a critical modulator in the tumor 
immune microenvironment and can function as a promising biomarker for predicting 
the immunotherapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, and drug 
sensitivity in cancer treatment.
