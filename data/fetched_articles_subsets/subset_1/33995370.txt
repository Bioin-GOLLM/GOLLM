In immunocompromised patients, EBV may elicit B-cell transformation and 
proliferation. A 5-year-old microcephalic boy was admitted with fever and 
non-malignant polymorphic T-cell lymphoproliferative disease associated with 
EBV. A presumptive diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency with inability to 
control EBV was made and next-generation sequencing led to the identification of 
a novel ZBTB24 mutation (ICF2-syndrome). This case shows that susceptibility to 
EBV seems to be particular of ICF-2 as it has not been described in the other 
types of ICF. It is mandatory to raise the hypothesis of an underlying PID in 
case of severe EBV infection.
