ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is essential for protein quality control in the 
ER, not only when the ER is stressed, but also at steady state. We report a new 
layer of homeostatic control, in which ERAD activity itself is regulated 
posttranscriptionally and independently of the unfolded protein response by 
adjusting the endogenous levels of EDEM1, OS-9, and SEL1L (ERAD enhancers). 
Functional UBC6e requires its precise location in the ER to form a 
supramolecular complex with Derlin2. This complex targets ERAD enhancers for 
degradation, a function that depends on UBC6e's enzymatic activity. Ablation of 
UBC6e causes upregulation of active ERAD enhancers and so increases clearance 
not only of terminally misfolded substrates, but also of wild-type glycoproteins 
that fold comparatively slowly in vitro and in vivo. The levels of proteins that 
comprise the ERAD machinery are thus carefully tuned and adjusted to prevailing 
needs.
