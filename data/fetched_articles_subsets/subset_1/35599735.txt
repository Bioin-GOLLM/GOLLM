BACKGROUND: Repeat expansions, including those in C9orf72 and ATXN2, have been 
implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, there have been few 
studies on the association of AR and NOP56 repeat expansion with ALS, especially 
in China. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of C9orf72 and ATXN2 
repeat mutations and investigate whether NOP56 and AR repeat expansion are risk 
factors for ALS.
METHODS: In this study, 736 ALS patients and several hundred healthy controls 
were recruited. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) 
were performed to determine the repeat lengths in C9orf72, ATXN2, AR, and NOP56.
RESULTS: GGGGCC repeats in C9orf72 were observed in six ALS patients (0.8%, 
6/736) but not in any of the controls (0/365). The patients with pathogenic 
GGGGCC repeats showed shorter median survival times than those with a normal 
genotype (p = 0.006). Regarding ATXN2 CAG repeats, we identified that 
intermediate repeat lengths (29-34 copies) were associated with ALS (p = 0.033), 
and there was no difference in clinical characteristics between the groups with 
and without intermediate repeats (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, we observed that there 
was no association between the repeat size in AR and NOP56 and ALS (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that pathogenetic repeats in C9orf72 are 
rare in China, while intermediate CAG repeats in ATXN2 are more frequent but 
have no effect on disease phenotypes; the repeat size in AR and NOP56 may not be 
a risk factor for ALS.
