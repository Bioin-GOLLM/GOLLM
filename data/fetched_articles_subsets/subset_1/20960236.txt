of living mice.

PURPOSE: Tumor microenvironments show remarkable tumor pO(2) heterogeneity, as 
seen in prior EPR pO(2) images (EPROI). pO(2) correlation with hypoxia response 
proteins is frustrated by large rapid pO(2) changes with position.
PROCEDURES: To overcome this limitation, biopsies stereotactically located in 
the EPROI were used to explore the relationship between vascular endothelial 
growth factor A (VEGF) concentrations in living mouse tumors and the local EPROI 
pO(2).
RESULTS: Quantitative ELISA VEGF concentrations correlated (p = 0.0068 to 0.019) 
with mean pO(2), median pO(2), and the fraction of voxels in the biopsy volume 
with pO(2) less than 3, 6, and 10 Torr.
CONCLUSIONS: This validates EPROI hypoxic fractions at the molecular level and 
provides a new paradigm for the assessment of the relationship, in vivo, between 
hypoxia and hypoxia response proteins. When translated to human subjects, this 
will enhance understanding of human tumor pathophysiology and cancer response to 
therapy.
