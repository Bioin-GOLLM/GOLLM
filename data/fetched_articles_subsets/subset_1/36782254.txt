BACKGROUND: We examined the relationship between brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: First, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 480 participants 
without known diabetes. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered 
after overnight fasting, and blood samples were collected at 0, 30, and 120 min. 
Second, a total of 3003 participants were enrolled for the case-control genetic 
analysis. After assigning them to a case or a control group based on age and CKD 
status, we investigated the association between BDNF gene variants and 
susceptibility to CKD.
RESULTS: A higher fasting serum BDNF quartile was significantly associated with 
a lower prevalence of CKD (P value for trend  < 0.001). Based on the receiver 
operating characteristic analysis, the fasting BDNF level had a larger area 
under the curve for differentiating CKD (0.645, 95% CI 0.583‒0.707) than the 
BDNF levels at both 30 min (0.547, 95% CI 0.481‒0.612) and 120 min (0.598, 95% 
CI 0.536‒0.661). A significantly lower CKD prevalence (odds ratio = 0.30, 95% CI 
0.12‒0.71) was observed in the highest quartile of fasting BDNF level than that 
in the lowest quartile, whereas no interquartile differences were observed for 
BDNF levels determined at 30 or 120 min during the OGTT. Furthermore, 
BDNF-associated variants, including rs12098908, rs12577517, and rs72891405, were 
significantly associated with CKD.
CONCLUSIONS: The BDNF level at fasting, but not at 30 and 120 min after glucose 
intake, was an independent indicator of CKD. In addition, significant 
associations were observed between three BDNF gene variants and CKD.
