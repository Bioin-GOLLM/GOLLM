The Cdc42 GTPase plays a central role in polarity development in many species. 
In budding yeast, Cdc42 is essential for polarized growth at the proper site and 
also for spontaneous cell polarization in the absence of spatial cues. Cdc42 
polarization is critical for multiple events in the G1 phase prior to bud 
emergence, including bud-site assembly, polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, 
and septin filament assembly to form a ring at the new bud site. Yet the 
mechanism by which Cdc42 polarizes is not fully understood. Here we report that 
biphasic Cdc42 polarization in the G1 phase is coupled to stepwise assembly of 
the septin ring for bud emergence. We show that the Rsr1 GTPase shares a 
partially redundant role with Gic1 and Gic2, two related Cdc42 effectors, in the 
first phase of Cdc42 polarization in haploid cells. We propose that the first 
phase of Cdc42 polarization is mediated by positive feedback loops that function 
in parallel-one involving Rsr1 via local activation of Cdc42 in response to 
spatial cues and another involving Gic1 or Gic2 via reduction of diffusion of 
active Cdc42.
