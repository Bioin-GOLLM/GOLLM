For microbial pathogens, phylogeographic differentiation seems to be relatively 
common. However, the neutral population structure of Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhi reflects the continued existence of ubiquitous haplotypes over millennia. 
In contrast, clinical use of fluoroquinolones has yielded at least 15 
independent gyrA mutations within a decade and stimulated clonal expansion of 
haplotype H58 in Asia and Africa. Yet, antibiotic-sensitive strains and 
haplotypes other than H58 still persist despite selection for antibiotic 
resistance. Neutral evolution in Typhi appears to reflect the asymptomatic 
carrier state, and adaptive evolution depends on the rapid transmission of 
phenotypic changes through acute infections.
