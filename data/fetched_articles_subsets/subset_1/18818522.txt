The knockout, knockdown or chemical inhibition of p53 stimulates autophagy. 
Moreover, autophagy-inducing stimuli such as nutrient depletion, rapamycin or 
lithium cause the depletion of cytoplasmic p53, which in turn is required for 
the induction of autophagy. Here, we show that retransfection of p53(-/-) HCT 
116 colon carcinoma cells with wild type p53 decreases autophagy down to 
baseline levels. Surprisingly, one third among a panel of 22 cancer-associated 
p53 single amino acid mutants also inhibited autophagy when transfected into 
p53(-/-) cells. Those variants of p53 that preferentially localize to the 
cytoplasm effectively repressed autophagy, whereas p53 mutants that display a 
prominently nuclear distribution failed to inhibit autophagy. The investigation 
of a series of deletion mutants revealed that removal of the DNA-binding domain 
from p53 fails to interfere with its role in the regulation of autophagy. 
Altogether, these results identify the cytoplasmic localization of p53 as the 
most important feature for p53-mediated autophagy inhibition. Moreover, the 
structural requirements for the two biological activities of extranuclear p53, 
namely induction of apoptosis and inhibition of autophagy, are manifestly 
different.
