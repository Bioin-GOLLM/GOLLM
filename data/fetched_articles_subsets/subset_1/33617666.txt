Four iridium (III) complexes Ir1-Ir4 were synthesized and characterized. 
Possessing high singlet oxygen production ability and specific 
mitochondria-localization, Ir1 was developed as a mitochondria-targeting 
photosensitizer. Ir1 exhibited strong phototoxicity against cancer cell line 
A549 and its corresponding cisplatin-resistant one A549R. In contrast, Ir1 
showed low cytotoxicity toward normal cell HLF. This selectivity resulted from 
the different uptake amount. With 405 nm irradiation, Ir1 induced 
mitochondria-mediated cell death in A549R cells, achieving the overcome of 
drug-resistant.
