In this study, we performed a genome-wide N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) 
mutagenesis screen in mice to identify novel genes or alleles that regulate 
erythropoiesis. Here, we describe a recessive mouse strain, called RBC19, 
harbouring a point mutation within the housekeeping gene, Tpi1, which encodes 
the glycolysis enzyme, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). A serine in place of a 
phenylalanine at amino acid 57 severely diminishes enzyme activity in red blood 
cells and other tissues, resulting in a macrocytic haemolytic phenotype in 
homozygous mice, which closely resembles human TPI deficiency. A rescue study 
was performed using bone marrow transplantation of wild-type donor cells, which 
restored all haematological parameters and increased red blood cell enzyme 
function to wild-type levels after 7 weeks. This is the first study performed in 
a mammalian model of TPI deficiency, demonstrating that the haematological 
phenotype can be rescued.
