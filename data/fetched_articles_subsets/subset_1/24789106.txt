BACKGROUND: The HIV-Brazil Cohort Study was established to analyze the 
effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and the impact of 
this treatment on morbidity, quality of life (QOL) and mortality. The study 
design, patients' profiles and characteristics of cART initiation between 2003 
and 2010 were described.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Since 2003, the HIV-Brazil Cohort has been 
following HIV-infected adults receiving cART at 26 public health care 
facilities, using routine clinical care data and self-reported QOL 
questionnaires. When not otherwise available, data are obtained from national 
information systems. The main outcomes of interest are diseases related or 
unrelated to HIV; suppression of viral replication; adverse events; virological, 
clinical and immunological failures; changes in the cART; and mortality. For the 
5,061 patients who started cART between 2003 and 2010, the median follow-up time 
was 4.1 years (IQR 2.2-5.9 years) with an 83.4% retention rate. Patient profiles 
were characterized by a predominance of men (male/female ratio 1.7∶1), with a 
mean age of 36.9 years (SD 9.9 years); 55.2% had been infected with HIV via 
heterosexual contact. The majority of patients (53.4%) initiated cART with a 
CD4+ T-cell count ≤200 cells/mm3. The medications most often used in the various 
treatment regimens were efavirenz (59.7%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (18.2%). The 
proportion of individuals achieving viral suppression within the first 12 months 
of cART use was 77.4% (95% CI 76.1-78.6). Nearly half (45.4%) of the patients 
presented HIV-related clinical manifestations after starting cART, and the AIDS 
mortality rate was 13.9 per 1,000 person-years.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results from cART use in the daily practice of health 
services remain relatively unknown in low- and middle-income countries, and 
studies with the characteristics of the HIV-Brazil Cohort contribute to 
minimizing these shortcomings, given its scope and patient profile, which is 
similar to that of the AIDS epidemic in the country.
