BACKGROUND: Associations between kidney function and dementia risk are 
inconclusive. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) severity is determined by levels of 
both estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the urine albumin to 
creatinine ratio (ACR). However, whether there is a graded increase in dementia 
risk for worse eGFR in each ACR category is unclear. Also, whether genetic risk 
for dementia impacts the associations is unknown. The current study aims to 
investigate the associations between eGFR and albuminuria with dementia risk 
both individually and jointly, whether the associations vary by different 
follow-up periods, and whether genetic factors modified the associations.
METHODS: In 202,702 participants aged ≥ 60 years from the UK Biobank, Cox 
proportional-hazards models were used to examine the associations between eGFR 
and urine albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) with risk of incident dementia. GFR was 
estimated based on serum creatinine, cystatin C, or both. The models were 
restricted to different follow-up periods (< 5 years, 5-10 years, 
and ≥ 10 years) to investigate potential reverse causation.
RESULTS: Over 15 years of follow-up, 6,042 participants developed dementia. 
Decreased kidney function (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2) was associated with an 
increased risk of dementia (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.42, 95% Confidence Interval 
[CI] 1.28-1.58), compared to normal kidney function (≥ 90 ml/min/1.73m2). The 
strength of the association remained consistent when the models were restricted 
to different periods of follow-up. The HRs for incident dementia were 1.16 (95% 
CI 1.07-1.26) and 2.24 (95% CI 1.79-2.80) for moderate (3-30 mg/mmol) and 
severely increased ACR (≥ 30 mg/mmol) compared to normal ACR (< 3 mg/mmol). 
Dose-response associations were observed when combining eGFR and ACR, with those 
in the severest eGFR and ACR group having the greatest risk of dementia 
(HR = 4.70, 95% CI 2.34-9.43). APOE status significantly modified the 
association (p = 0.04), with stronger associations observed among participants 
with a lower genetic risk of dementia. There was no evidence of an interaction 
between kidney function and non-APOE polygenic risk of dementia with dementia 
risk (p = 0.42).
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney dysfunction and albuminuria were individually and jointly 
associated with higher dementia risk. The associations were greater amongst 
participants with a lower genetic risk of dementia based on APOE, but not 
non-APOE polygenic risk.
