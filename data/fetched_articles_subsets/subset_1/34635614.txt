BACKGROUND: Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) causes various 
infections, including urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis, and neonatal 
meningitis. ExPEC strains have virulence factors (VFs) that facilitate infection 
by allowing bacterial cells to migrate into and multiply within the host. We 
compared the microbiological characteristics of ExPEC isolates from blood and 
urine specimens from UTI patients.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center, prospective study in an 855-bed 
tertiary-care hospital in Korea. We consecutively recruited 80 hospitalized UTI 
patients with E. coli isolates, which were isolated from blood and/or urine, and 
urine alone between March 2019 and May 2020. We evaluated the 80 E. coli 
isolates for the presence of bacterial genes encoding the sequence types (STs), 
antimicrobial resistance, and VFs using whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
RESULTS: We found no significant differences in STs, antimicrobial resistance 
patterns, or VFs between isolates from blood and urine specimens. ST131, a 
pandemic multidrug-resistant clone present in both blood and urine, was the most 
frequent ST (N=19/80, 24%), and ST131 isolates carried more virulence genes, 
especially, tsh and espC, than non-ST131 isolates. The virulence scores of the 
ST131 group and the ST69, ST95, and ST1193 groups differed significantly 
(P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We found no STs and VFs associated with bacteremia in WGS data of 
E. coli isolates from UTI patients. ST131 was the most frequent ST among UTI 
causing isolates and carried more VF genes than non-ST131 isolates.
