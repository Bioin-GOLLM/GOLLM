The transport of transition metal ions by members of the SLC11/NRAMP family 
constitutes a ubiquitous mechanism for the uptake of Fe2+ and Mn2+ across all 
kingdoms of life. Despite the strong conservation of the family, two of its 
branches have evolved a distinct substrate preference with one mediating Mg2+ 
uptake in prokaryotes and another the transport of Al3+ into plant cells. Our 
previous work on the SLC11 transporter from Eggerthella lenta revealed the basis 
for its Mg2+ selectivity (Ramanadane et al., 2022). Here, we have addressed the 
structural and functional properties of a putative Al3+ transporter from Setaria 
italica. We show that the protein transports diverse divalent metal ions and 
binds the trivalent ions Al3+ and Ga3+, which are both presumable substrates. 
Its cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure displays an occluded 
conformation that is closer to an inward- than an outward-facing state, with a 
binding site that is remodeled to accommodate the increased charge density of 
its transported substrate.
