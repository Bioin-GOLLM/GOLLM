BACKGROUND: Blood pressure is influenced by hereditary factors and dietary 
habits. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dietary salt 
consumption and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on blood pressure (BP).
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 2728 male participants who 
participated in a health examination in 2009. Average dietary salt consumption 
was estimated using electronically collected meal purchase data from cafeteria. 
A multivariate analysis, adjusting for clinically relevant factors, was 
conducted to examine whether the effect on BP of salt consumption, SNPs, and 
interaction between salt consumption and each SNP. This study examined the SNPs 
AGT rs699 (Met235Thr), ADD1 rs4961 (Gly460Trp), NPPA rs5063 (Val32Met), GPX1 
rs1050450 (Pro198Leu), and AGTR1 rs5186 (A1166C) in relation to hypertension and 
salt sensitivity.
RESULTS: BP was not significantly associated with SNPs or salt consumption. The 
interaction between salt consumption and SNPs with systolic BP showed a 
significant association in NPPA rs5063 (Val32Met) (P = 0.023) and a marginal 
trend toward significance in rs4961 and rs1050450 (P = 0.060 and 0.067, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: The effect of salt consumption on BP differed by genotype. Dietary 
salt consumption and genetic variation can predict a high risk of hypertension.
