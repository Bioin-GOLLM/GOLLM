Common sequence variants in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are suspected 
etiological causes of complex disorders. We previously identified an intronic 
enhancer variant in the RET gene disrupting SOX10 binding and increasing 
Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) risk 4-fold. We now show that two other functionally 
independent CRE variants, one binding Gata2 and the other binding Rarb, also 
reduce Ret expression and increase risk 2- and 1.7-fold. By studying human and 
mouse fetal gut tissues and cell lines, we demonstrate that reduced RET 
expression propagates throughout its gene regulatory network, exerting effects 
on both its positive and negative feedback components. We also provide evidence 
that the presence of a combination of CRE variants synergistically reduces RET 
expression and its effects throughout the GRN. These studies show how the 
effects of functionally independent non-coding variants in a coordinated gene 
regulatory network amplify their individually small effects, providing a model 
for complex disorders.
