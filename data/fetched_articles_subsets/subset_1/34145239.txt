Abnormalities in GABAergic inhibitory circuits have been implicated in the 
aetiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is caused by genetic and 
environmental factors. Several genes have been associated with syndromic forms 
of ASD, including FOXG1. However, when and how dysregulation of FOXG1 can result 
in defects in inhibitory circuit development and ASD-like social impairments is 
unclear. Here, we show that increased or decreased FoxG1 expression in both 
excitatory and inhibitory neurons results in ASD-related circuit and social 
behavior deficits in our mouse models. We observe that the second postnatal week 
is the critical period when regulation of FoxG1 expression is required to 
prevent subsequent ASD-like social impairments. Transplantation of GABAergic 
precursor cells prior to this critical period and reduction in GABAergic tone 
via Gad2 mutation ameliorates and exacerbates circuit functionality and social 
behavioral defects, respectively. Our results provide mechanistic insight into 
the developmental timing of inhibitory circuit formation underlying ASD-like 
phenotypes in mouse models.
