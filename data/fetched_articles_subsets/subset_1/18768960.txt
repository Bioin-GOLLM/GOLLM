Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in sub-Saharan Africa represent 
about 56% of global infections. Study of active-site mutations (the V82A single 
mutation and the V82F I84V double mutation) in the less-studied South African 
HIV type 1 subtype C (C-SA) protease indicated that neither mutation had a 
significant impact on the proteolytic functioning of the protease. However, the 
binding affinities of, and inhibition by, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, and 
nelfinavir were weaker for each variant than for the wild-type protease, with 
the double mutant exhibiting the most dramatic change. Therefore, our results 
show that the C-SA V82F I84V double mutation decreased the binding affinities of 
protease inhibitors to levels significantly lower than that required for 
effective inhibition.
