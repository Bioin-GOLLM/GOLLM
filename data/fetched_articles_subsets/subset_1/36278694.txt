The novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, Omicron (B.1.1.529), is being testified, and the 
WHO has characterized Omicron as a variant of concern due to its higher 
transmissibility and very contagious behavior, immunization breakthrough cases. 
Here, the comparative proteomic study has been conducted on spike-protein, hACE2 
of five lineages (α, β, δ, γ and Omicron. The docking was performed on spike 
protein- hACE-2 protein using HADDOCK, and PRODIGY was used to analyze the 
binding energy affinity using a reduced Haddock score. Followed by 
superimposition in different variant-based protein structures and calculated the 
esteem root mean square deviation (RMSD). This study reveals that Omicron was 
seen generating a monophyletic clade. Further, as α variant is the principal 
advanced strain after Wuhan SARS-CoV-2, and that is the reason it was showing 
the least likeness rate with the Omicron and connoting Omicron has developed of 
late with the extreme number of mutations. α variant has shown the highest 
binding affinity with hACE2, followed by β strain, and followed with γ. Omicron 
showed a penultimate binding relationship, while the δ variant was seen as 
having the least binding affinity. This proteomic basis in silico analysis of 
variable spike proteins of variants will impart light on the development of 
vaccines and the identification of mutations occurring in the upcoming variants.
