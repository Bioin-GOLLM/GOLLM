Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a hormone primarily produced in bone cells, 
targets the kidney to accelerate phosphate excretion into the urine and 
suppresses vitamin D synthesis, thereby inducing a negative phosphate balance. 
Excessive serum FGF23 due to hereditary disorders such as hypophosphatemic 
rickets leads to phosphate wasting and impaired bone mineralization. In 
contrast, deficiencies in FGF23 are associated with hyperphosphatemia, elevated 
1,25(OH)(2)D(3), ectopic ossification in soft tissues, and defects in skeletal 
mineralization. Recent studies of human genetic disorders and genetically 
engineered mice, as well as the in vitro approaches, have clarified some 
mysteries in FGF23 regulation and its potential roles in bone modeling and 
remodeling, which are summarized in this review article.
