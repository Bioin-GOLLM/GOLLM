The genes of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) activator (DAOA or G72; 13q34) and DAAO 
(12q24) have been suggested as candidate genes and involved in the 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor regulation pathway for schizophrenia. In order to 
evaluate the potential association of these two genes with schizophrenia in a 
Taiwanese sample, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for DAAO 
(rs2111902, rs3918346, rs3741775) and eleven SNPs for G72 (rs3916965, rs3916966, 
rs3916967, rs2391191, rs3916968, rs947267, rs778294, rs3916970, rs3916971, 
rs778293, rs3918342) were genotyped by the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry method in 
218 families (864 individuals) containing at least two siblings affected with 
schizophrenia. In SNP-based single locus association analyses, neither G72 nor 
DAAO showed significant association with schizophrenia. Additionally, a 
three-SNP haplotype in DAAO, and a four-SNP as well as a two-SNP haplotype in 
G72, showed no significant associations with schizophrenia. These results 
suggest that the DAAO and G72 genes are not susceptibility genes for 
schizophrenia in a Taiwanese sample.
