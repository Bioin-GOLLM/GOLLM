The RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK cascade is an essential signaling pathway, with activation 
typically mediated through cell surface receptors. The kinase inhibitors 
vemurafenib and dabrafenib, which target oncogenic BRAF V600E, have shown 
significant clinical efficacy in melanoma patients harboring this mutation. 
Because of paradoxical pathway activation, both agents were demonstrated to 
promote growth and metastasis of tumor cells with RAS mutations in preclinical 
models and are contraindicated for treatment of cancer patients with BRAF WT 
background, including patients with KRAS or NRAS mutations. In order to 
eliminate the issues associated with paradoxical MAPK pathway activation and to 
provide therapeutic benefit to patients with RAS mutant cancers, we sought to 
identify a compound not only active against BRAF V600E but also wild type BRAF 
and CRAF. On the basis of its superior in vitro and in vivo profile, compound 13 
was selected for further development and is currently being evaluated in phase I 
clinical studies.
