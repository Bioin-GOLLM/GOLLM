Current therapies for Renal Cell Carcinoma favor vascular endothelial growth 
factor receptor (VEGF-R) tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors (TKIs). In theory, 
these are most applicable in tumors that have lost VHL-with subsequent 
stabilization of HIF and upregulation of VEGF. A subset of patients harbor 
primary-refractory disease, as in this case, where there was no evidence for 
loss of VHL or chromosome 3p. We evaluated molecular targeted agents in viable 
tumor cells cultured from a patient's clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Of 
66 agents, only dasatinib, an inhibitor of Src tyrosine kinase, strongly reduced 
viability of the patient's cultured kidney tumor cells. Immunostaining of the 
original primary tumor revealed strong positivity for VHL and Src protein 
expression. Functional evaluation of a patient's tumor cells appears feasible in 
the setting of RCC.
