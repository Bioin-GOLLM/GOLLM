BACKGROUND: Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is a complex, multifactorial 
condition, caused by mechanical, neurohormonal, and genetic factors. We have 
previously observed association of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), 
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inflammatory pathway genes with LVD. 
Therefore the present study was undertaken to identify the combination of 
genetic variants and their possible interactions contributing towards genetic 
susceptibility to LVD in the background of coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 230 healthy controls and 510 consecutive 
patients with angiographically confirmed CAD. Among them, 162 with reduced left 
ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF≤45%) were categorized as having LVD. We 
analyzed 11 polymorphisms of RAAS, MMPs and inflammatory pathways. Single locus 
analysis showed that AT1 A1166C (p value<0.001; OR=3.67), MMP9 R668Q (p 
value=0.007; OR=3.48) and NFKB1-94 ATTG ins/del (p value=0.013; OR=2.01) 
polymorphisms were independently associated with LVD when compared with both 
non-LVD patients and healthy controls. High-order gene-gene interaction 
analysis, using classification and regression tree (CART) and multifactor 
dimensionality reduction (MDR) revealed that AT1 A1166C and NFKB1-94 ATTG 
ins/del polymorphisms jointly increased the risk of LVD to great extent 
(p-value=0.001; OR=8.55) and best four-factor interaction model consisted of AT1 
A1166C, MMP7 A-181G, MMP9 R668Q and NFKB1-94 ATTG ins/del polymorphisms with 
testing accuracy of 0.566 and cross validation consistency (CVC)=9/10 
(permutation p<0.001) showed increased risk for LVD respectively.
CONCLUSION: AT1 A1166C independently and in combination with MMP9 R668Q and 
NFKB1-94 ATTG ins/del polymorphisms plays important role in conferring genetic 
susceptibility to LVD in CAD patients.
