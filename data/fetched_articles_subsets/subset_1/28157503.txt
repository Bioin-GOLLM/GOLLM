Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) lies at the center of the faithful 
duplication of eukaryotic genomes. With its distinctive doughnut-shaped 
molecular structure, PCNA was originally studied for its role in stimulating DNA 
polymerases. However, we now know that PCNA does much more than promote 
processive DNA synthesis. Because of the complexity of the events involved, 
cellular DNA replication poses major threats to genomic integrity. Whatever 
predicament lies ahead for the replication fork, PCNA is there to orchestrate 
the events necessary to handle it. Through its many protein interactions and 
various post-translational modifications, PCNA has far-reaching impacts on a 
myriad of cellular functions.
