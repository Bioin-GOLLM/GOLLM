The present study reports the case of a 3-h old male with a de novo unbalanced 
t(15;22) translocation and velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), with other 
abnormalities. The manifestations of the condition observed in the patient 
included cleft palate with feeding difficulties, respiratory infection, 
dysmorphic face with almond-shaped eyes, a long and wide nose, small and low-set 
ears, tetralogy of Fallot, cryptorchidism and varus equinus. Standard lymphocyte 
cytogenetic analysis using G-banding demonstrated a 45,XY,-22,der 
(15),t(15;22)(q26.2;q12) karyotype. Fluorescent in situ hybridization with 
DiGeorge/VCFS TUPLE 1 confirmed 22q11 deletions. These cytogenetic aspects 
appear to be rare in the etiology of VCFS, as >1% of all 22q11 deletions are the 
result of an unbalanced translocation, which involves chromosomes 22 and another 
chromosome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported case where 
the clinical features associated with VCFS are combined with an unbalanced 
(15;22) translocation involving the critical 22q11.2 region.
