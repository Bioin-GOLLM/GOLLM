In our ongoing effort of discovering anticancer and chemopreventive agents, a 
series of 2-arylindole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated toward 
aromatase and quinone reductase 1 (QR1). Biological evaluation revealed that 
several compounds (e.g., 2d, IC50 = 1.61 μM; 21, IC50 = 3.05 μM; and 27, 
IC50 = 3.34 μM) showed aromatase inhibitory activity with half maximal 
inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in the low micromolar concentrations. 
With regard to the QR1 induction activity, 11 exhibited the highest QR1 
induction ratio (IR) with a low concentration to double activity (CD) value 
(IR = 8.34, CD = 2.75 μM), while 7 showed the most potent CD value of 1.12 μM. A 
dual acting compound 24 showed aromatase inhibition (IC50 = 9.00 μM) as well as 
QR1 induction (CD = 5.76 μM) activities. Computational docking studies using 
CDOCKER (Discovery Studio 3.5) provided insight in regard to the potential 
binding modes of 2-arylindoles within the aromatase active site. Predominantly, 
the 2-arylindoles preferred binding with the 2-aryl group toward a small 
hydrophobic pocket within the active site. The C-5 electron withdrawing group on 
indole was predicted to have an important role and formed a hydrogen bond with 
Ser478 (OH). Alternatively, meta-pyridyl analogs may orient with the pyridyl 
3'-nitrogen coordinating with the heme group.
