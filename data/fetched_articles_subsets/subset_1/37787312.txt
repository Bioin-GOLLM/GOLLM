CONTEXT: Adiponectin, an adipokine, and its gene polymorphisms have been 
associated with breast cancer risk in various populations.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the association of the 
circulating levels of adiponectin and adiponectin gene polymorphism SNP 
rs2241766 with breast cancer and its clinicopathological characteristics in 
Indian women. A case-control study was carried out with 60 Ductal Infiltrating 
Breast Carcinoma patients and 60 age-matched healthy controls. Serum adiponectin 
levels were measured by ELISA. SNP genotyping was done by Polymerase Chain 
Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Serum adiponectin levels were compared using the Mann 
Whitney U test. The frequency of genotypes was compared using the Chi-square 
test. The odds ratio was calculated using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Lower serum adiponectin level was associated with increased risk of 
breast cancer in postmenopausal women (OR - 7.69; 95% CI - 2.16-27.43, P = 
0.002) but not in the reproductive age group women. There was no association 
between adiponectin levels with the TNM stage of the tumor, histopathological 
grade, erbB2, and ER/PR status. The SNP rs2241766 polymorphism was not 
associated with breast cancer risk but the mutant genotypes TG/GG was found to 
be significantly associated with the lower histopathological grade of the tumor 
(X2 (2, N = 60) = 8.62, P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that low serum adiponectin levels are associated 
with an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The TG/GG 
genotypes of SNP rs2241766 polymorphism were associated with a lower 
histological grade of the tumor.
