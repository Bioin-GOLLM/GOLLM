Sublancin is shown to be an S-linked glycopeptide containing a glucose attached 
to a cysteine residue, establishing a new post-translational modification. The 
activity of the S-glycosyl transferase was reconstituted in vitro, and the 
enzyme is shown to have relaxed substrate specificity, allowing the preparation 
of analogs of sublancin. Glycosylation is essential for its antimicrobial 
activity.
