Congenital microcephaly (CM) exhibits broad clinical and genetic heterogeneity 
and is thus categorized into several subtypes. However, the recent bloom of 
disease-gene discoveries has revealed more overlaps than differences in the 
underlying genetic architecture for these clinical sub-categories, complicating 
the differential diagnosis. Moreover, the mechanism of the paradigm shift from a 
brain-restricted to a multi-organ phenotype is only vaguely understood. This 
review article highlights the critical factors considered while defining CM 
subtypes. It also presents possible arguments on long-standing questions of the 
brain-specific nature of CM caused by a dysfunction of the ubiquitously 
expressed proteins. We argue that brain-specific splicing events and 
organ-restricted protein expression may contribute in part to disparate clinical 
manifestations. We also highlight the role of genetic modifiers and de novo 
variants in the multi-organ phenotype of CM and emphasize their consideration in 
molecular characterization. This review thus attempts to expand our 
understanding of the phenotypic and etiological variability in CM and invites 
the development of more comprehensive guidelines.
