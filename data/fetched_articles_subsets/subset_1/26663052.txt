OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) gene 
polymorphism and childhood maltreatment on antidepressant treatment.
METHODS: Two hundred and four patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have 
received treatment with single antidepressant drugs and were followed up for 8 
weeks. Hamilton depression scale-17 (HAMD-17) was used to evaluate the severity 
of depressive symptoms and therapeutic effect. Childhood maltreatment was 
assessed using Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, a 28-item Short Form (CTQ-SF). 
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the IL1B gene was determined using a 
SNaPshot method. Correlation of rs16944 gene polymorphism with response to 
treatment was analyzed using Unphased 3.0.13 software. The main and interactive 
effects of SNP and childhood maltreatment on the antidepressant treatment were 
analyzed using Logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: No significant difference of gender, age, year of education, family 
history, episode time, and antidepressant agents was detected between the 
remitters and non-remitters. Association analysis has found that the SNP rs16944 
in the IL1B AA genotype carriers antidepressant response was poorer (Ï‡2=3.931, 
P=0.047). No significant difference was detected in the CTQ scores between the 
two groups. Genetic and environmental interaction analysis has demonstrated a 
significant correlation between rs16944 AA genotype and childhood maltreatment 
and poorer response to antidepressant treatment.
CONCLUSION: The SNP rs16944 in the IL1B gene and its interaction with childhood 
maltreatment may influence the effect of antidepressant treatment for patients 
with MDD.
