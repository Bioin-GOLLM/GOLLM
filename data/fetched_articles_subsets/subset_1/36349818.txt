This report describes a case of an 11-year-old Chinese boy with cystic fibrosis 
(CF) bearing the c.1521_1523delCTT/c.3874-4522A>G genotype, an extremely rare CF 
genotype in the Chinese population. Notably, the deep intron mutation 
c.3874-4522A>G, which has mainly been reported in patients with phenotypically 
mild CF, is identified here for the first time in a Chinese patient with severe 
CF. In the case discussed here, the c.3874-4522A>G mutation was associated with 
severe pulmonary disease with early symptoms onset, progressive bronchiectasis, 
recurrent airway infection with both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, rapid decline of lung function and 
poor weight gain. Despite intensive hospital-based pulmonary care and optimized 
therapy, the child died of cardiopulmonary failure 3 months after discharge.
