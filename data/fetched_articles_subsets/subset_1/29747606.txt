BACKGROUND: Several studies looking into the association between insulin-like 
growth factor-1 (IGF-1) gene polymorphisms and osteoporosis predisposition have 
been conducted among Chinese population with conflicting outcomes. The present 
systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to appraise and synthesize the 
existing evidence, so as to provide a more precise and reliable association 
between polymorphisms in IGF-1 gene and osteoporosis.
METHODS: Five electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, 
CNKI and Wanfang were systematically searched for potential studies. Summary 
odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were 
calculated to evaluate the association. The best-matching genetic model of 
inheritance was determined using a genetic-model free approach.
RESULTS: Six case-control studies comprising 2068 osteoporosis patients and 2071 
healthy controls were obtained for the meta-analysis. Dominant model was 
confirmed to be the best-matching genetic model (TT + TC versus CC). The overall 
data suggested that rs35767 polymorphism was significantly associated with 
osteoporosis vulnerability (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07, 1.37; P = 0.002). When 
stratifying the participants and performing subgroup-analysis according to 
source of patients, the result suggested that rs35767 was significantly 
correlated to osteoporosis in post-menopausal women subgroup (OR 1.29, 95% CI 
1.08, 1.54; P = 0.005), but the correlation was not established in the subgroup 
of both gender (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.96, 1.35; P = 0.12).
CONCLUSION: Taken together, the findings of our current study suggested a 
significant association between rs35767 polymorphism and risk of osteoporosis in 
Chinese post-menopausal women.
