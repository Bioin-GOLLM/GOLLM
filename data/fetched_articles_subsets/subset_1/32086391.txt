We sought to define the landscape of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in prostate 
cancers and the relationship of exon choice to known cancer driver alterations. 
To do so, we compiled a metadataset composed of 876 RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) 
samples from five publicly available sources representing a range of prostate 
phenotypes from normal tissue to drug-resistant metastases. We subjected these 
samples to exon-level analysis with rMATS-turbo, purpose-built software designed 
for large-scale analyses of splicing, and identified 13,149 high-confidence 
cassette exon events with variable incorporation across samples. We then 
developed a computational framework, pathway enrichment-guided activity study of 
alternative splicing (PEGASAS), to correlate transcriptional signatures of 50 
different cancer driver pathways with these alternative splicing events. We 
discovered that Myc signaling was correlated with incorporation of a set of 
1,039 cassette exons enriched in genes encoding RNA binding proteins. Using a 
human prostate epithelial transformation assay, we confirmed the Myc regulation 
of 147 of these exons, many of which introduced frameshifts or encoded premature 
stop codons. Our results connect changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing to 
oncogenic alterations common in prostate and many other cancers. We also 
establish a role for Myc in regulating RNA splicing by controlling the 
incorporation of nonsense-mediated decay-determinant exons in genes encoding RNA 
binding proteins.
