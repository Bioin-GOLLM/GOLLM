An oxidized frying oil (OFO) diet has been reported to induce an increase in 
lipid peroxidation and a reduction in vitamin E status in animal tissues. This 
study was performed to investigate how vitamin E metabolism is influenced by 
OFO. Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups, a control group (CO) and 
two OFO-fed groups (OF and OFE). The diet of the OFE group was supplemented with 
an extra 50 mg/kg of alpha-tocopherol acetate and thus contained twice as much 
vitamin E as that of the OF group. After six weeks on these diets, liver 
alpha-tocopherol levels in the OF group were the significantly lowest among the 
three groups. Excretion of the alpha-tocopherol metabolite, alpha-carboxyethyl 
hydroxychroman (alpha-CEHC) in the urine was significantly lower in the OF group 
than in the other two groups. There were no significant differences in protein 
levels of alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) and multidrug resistance 
protein among the three groups. Protein levels of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 
(CYP) 3A, CYP4A, and catalase were markedly increased in both groups on the OFO 
diet. This suggests that an OFO diet may interfere with medicine metabolism and 
needs further investigation.
