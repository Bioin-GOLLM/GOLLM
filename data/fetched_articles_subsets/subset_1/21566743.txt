A great amount of literature has demonstrated a connection between obesity, 
visceral fat and the metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, 
and hyperlipidemia. Lately, there has been an increased interest in 
understanding if cancer is related to obesity and visceral fat accumulation. The 
prevalence of both obesity and cancer are increasing and there has been keen 
interest in the relationship between visceral adiposity and the biology of 
cancers. White adipose tissue (WAT) provides a limitless capacity for 
triglyceride storage vital for survival. The concurrent rise in insulin, 
glucose, and lipids during meals stimulates triglyceride formation and storage 
in WAT. WAT is also recognized as an endocrine organ that secretes multiple 
cytokines such as leptin and adiponectin. In addition, leptin and adiponectin 
have been adipocytokines that attracted attention for cancer research. Thus, in 
this review, we will describe recent progress made in obesity, visceral 
adiposity, leptin and adiponectin in the involvement of various cancers.
