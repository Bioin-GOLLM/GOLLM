As HIV-1-encoded envelope protein traverses the secretory pathway, it may be 
modified with N- and O-linked carbohydrate. When the gp120s of HIV-1 NL4-3, 
HIV-1 YU2, HIV-1 Bal, HIV-1 JRFL, and HIV-1 JRCSF were expressed as secreted 
proteins, the threonine at consensus position 499 was found to be 
O-glycosylated. For SIVmac239, the corresponding threonine was also glycosylated 
when gp120 was recombinantly expressed. Similarly-positioned, highly-conserved 
threonines in the influenza A virus H1N1 HA1 and H5N1 HA1 envelope proteins were 
also found to carry O-glycans when expressed as secreted proteins. In all cases, 
the threonines were modified predominantly with disialylated core 1 glycans, 
together with related core 1 and core 2 structures. Secreted HIV-1 gp140 was 
modified to a lesser extent with mainly monosialylated core 1 O-glycans, 
suggesting that the ectodomain of the gp41 transmembrane component may limit the 
accessibility of Thr499 to glycosyltransferases. In striking contrast to these 
findings, gp120 on purified virions of HIV-1 Bal and SIV CP-MAC lacked any 
detectable O-glycosylation of the C-terminal threonine. Our results indicate the 
absence of O-linked carbohydrates on Thr499 as it exists on the surface of 
virions and suggest caution in the interpretation of analyses of 
post-translational modifications that utilize recombinant forms of envelope 
protein.
