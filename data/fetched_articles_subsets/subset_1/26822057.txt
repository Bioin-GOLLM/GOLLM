DNA polymerase III (DNA pol III) is a multi-subunit replication machine 
responsible for the accurate and rapid replication of bacterial genomes, 
however, how it functions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) requires further 
investigation. We have reconstituted the leading-strand replication process of 
the Mtb DNA pol III holoenzyme in vitro, and investigated the physical and 
functional relationships between its key components. We verify the presence of 
an αβ2ε polymerase-clamp-exonuclease replicase complex by biochemical methods 
and protein-protein interaction assays in vitro and in vivo and confirm that, in 
addition to the polymerase activity of its α subunit, Mtb DNA pol III has two 
potential proofreading subunits; the α and ε subunits. During DNA replication, 
the presence of the β2 clamp strongly promotes the polymerization of the αβ2ε 
replicase and reduces its exonuclease activity. Our work provides a foundation 
for further research on the mechanism by which the replication machinery 
switches between replication and proofreading and provides an experimental 
platform for the selection of antimicrobials targeting DNA replication in Mtb.
