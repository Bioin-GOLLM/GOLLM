ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporters, ubiquitous in all kingdoms of life, 
carry out essential substrate transport reactions across cell membranes. Their 
transmembrane domains bind and translocate substrates and are connected to a 
pair of nucleotide binding domains, which bind and hydrolyze ATP to energize 
import or export of substrates. Over four decades of investigations into ABC 
transporters have revealed numerous details from atomic-level structural 
insights to their functional and physiological roles. Despite all these 
advances, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic principles of ABC 
transporter function remains elusive. The human multidrug resistance transporter 
ABCB1, also referred to as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is one of the most intensively 
studied ABC exporters. Using ABCB1 as the reference point, we aim to compare the 
dominating mechanistic models of substrate transport and ATP hydrolysis for ABC 
exporters and to highlight the experimental and computational evidence in their 
support. In particular, we point out in silico studies that enhance and 
complement available biochemical data. "This article is part of a Special Issue
