Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a prototypical B cell-mediated autoimmune disease 
affecting 20-50 people per 100,000. The majority of patients fall into two 
clinically distinguishable types based on whether they produce autoantibodies 
targeting the acetylcholine receptor (AChR-MG) or muscle specific kinase 
(MuSK-MG). The autoantibodies are pathogenic, but whether their generation is 
associated with broader defects in the B cell repertoire is unknown. To address 
this question, we performed deep sequencing of the BCR repertoire of AChR-MG, 
MuSK-MG, and healthy subjects to generate ∼518,000 unique VH and VL sequences 
from sorted naive and memory B cell populations. AChR-MG and MuSK-MG subjects 
displayed distinct gene segment usage biases in both VH and VL sequences within 
the naive and memory compartments. The memory compartment of AChR-MG was further 
characterized by reduced positive selection of somatic mutations in the VH CDR 
and altered VH CDR3 physicochemical properties. The VL repertoire of MuSK-MG was 
specifically characterized by reduced V-J segment distance in recombined 
sequences, suggesting diminished VL receptor editing during B cell development. 
Our results identify large-scale abnormalities in both the naive and memory B 
cell repertoires. Particular abnormalities were unique to either AChR-MG or 
MuSK-MG, indicating that the repertoires reflect the distinct properties of the 
subtypes. These repertoire abnormalities are consistent with previously observed 
defects in B cell tolerance checkpoints in MG, thereby offering additional 
insight regarding the impact of tolerance defects on peripheral autoimmune 
repertoires. These collective findings point toward a deformed B cell repertoire 
as a fundamental component of MG.
