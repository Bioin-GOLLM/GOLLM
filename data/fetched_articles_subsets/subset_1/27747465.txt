PURPOSE: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous disorder 
caused by multiple factors. Although genetic and immunological analyses are 
required for a definitive diagnosis, no reports of a comprehensive genetic study 
of a Japanese population are available.
METHODS: In total, 35 Japanese patients <16 years of age suffering from IBD, 
including 27 patients aged <6 years with very early-onset IBD, were enrolled in 
this multicenter study. Exome and targeted gene panel sequencing was performed 
for all patients. Mutations in genes responsible for primary immunodeficiency 
diseases (PID) and clinical and immunological parameters were evaluated 
according to disease type.
RESULTS: We identified monogenic mutations in 5 of the 35 patients (14.3 %). We 
identified compound heterozygous and homozygous splice-site mutations in 
interleukin-10 receptor A (IL-10RA) in two patients, nonsense mutations in 
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in two patients, and a missense 
mutation in cytochrome b beta chain in one patient. Using assays for protein 
expression levels, IL-10 signaling, and cytokine production, we confirmed that 
the mutations resulted in loss of function. For each patient, genotype was 
significantly associated with clinical findings. We successfully treated a 
patient with a XIAP mutation by allogeneic cord blood hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation, and his symptoms were ameliorated completely.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted sequencing and immunological analysis are useful for 
screening monogenic disorders and selecting curative therapies in pediatric 
patients with IBD. The genes responsible for PID are frequently involved in 
pediatric IBD and play critical roles in normal immune homeostasis in the 
gastrointestinal tract.
