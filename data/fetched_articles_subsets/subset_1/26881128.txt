Activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factors is required 
for the induction of synaptic plasticity and memory formation. All components of 
this signaling pathway are localized at synapses, and transcriptionally active 
NF-κB dimers move to the nucleus to translate synaptic signals into altered gene 
expression. Neuron-specific inhibition results in altered connectivity of 
excitatory and inhibitory synapses and functionally in selective learning 
deficits. Recent research on transgenic mice with impaired or hyperactivated 
NF-κB gave important insights into plasticity-related target gene expression 
that is regulated by NF-κB. In this minireview, we update the available data on 
the role of this transcription factor for learning and memory formation and 
comment on cross-sectional activation of NF-κB in the aged and diseased brain 
that may directly or indirectly affect κB-dependent transcription of synaptic 
genes.
