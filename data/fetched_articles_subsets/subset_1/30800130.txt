The progressive infiltration of immune cells is associated with the progression 
of melanoma. Specifically, Th17 cells in melanoma microenvironment have both 
antitumor and protumor effects. It is now necessary to understand the 
contradictory data associated with how Th17 cells play a role in melanoma. This 
review will summarize the current knowledge regarding the potential mechanisms 
that may be involved in the effects of Th17 cells in melanoma progression. 
Currently, since adoptive transferring Th17 cells has been successful in 
eradicating melanoma in mice, it offers promise for next-generation adoptive 
cell transfer, as ex vivo expanded stemness-like memory Th17 cells which are 
induced by distinct cytokines or pharmacologic reagents may be infused into 
melanoma patients to potentiate treatment outcome.
