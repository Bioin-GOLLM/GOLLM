Hereditary pancreatitis is due to heterozygosity for gain-of-function mutations 
in the cationic trypsinogen gene which result in increased levels of active 
trypsin within pancreatic acinar cells and autodigestion of the pancreas. The 
number of disease-causing defects is generally considered to be low. To gain 
further insight into the molecular basis of this disorder, DNA sequence analysis 
of all five exons was performed in 109 unrelated patients with idiopathic 
chronic pancreatitis in order to determine the variability of the underlying 
mutations. Two German females and one German male were carriers of the most 
common N29I and R122H mutations (trypsinogen numbering system). In a Turkish 
proband, an arginine (CGT) to cysteine (TGT) substitution at amino acid position 
116 was identified. Family screening demonstrated that the patient had inherited 
the mutation from his asymptomatic father and that he had transmitted it to both 
of his children, his daughter being symptomatic since the age of 3 years. In 
addition, a German male was found to be a heterozygote for a D100H (GAC-->CAC) 
amino acid replacement. Our data provide evidence for genetic heterogeneity of 
hereditary pancreatitis. The growing number of cationic trypsinogen mutations is 
expected to change current mutation screening practices for this disease.
