Medulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant pediatric brain tumor and is 
divided into at least four subgroups known as WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. 
Here, we characterized gene regulation mechanisms in the most aggressive 
subtype, Group 3 tumors, through genome-wide chromatin and expression profiling. 
Our results show that most active distal sites in these tumors are occupied by 
the transcription factor OTX2. Highly active OTX2-bound enhancers are often 
arranged as clusters of adjacent peaks and are also bound by the transcription 
factor NEUROD1. These sites are responsive to OTX2 and NEUROD1 knockdown and 
could also be generated de novo upon ectopic OTX2 expression in primary cells, 
showing that OTX2 cooperates with NEUROD1 and plays a major role in maintaining 
and possibly establishing regulatory elements as a pioneer factor. Among OTX2 
target genes, we identified the kinase NEK2, whose knockdown and pharmacologic 
inhibition decreased cell viability. Our studies thus show that OTX2 controls 
the regulatory landscape of Group 3 medulloblastoma through cooperative activity 
at enhancer elements and contributes to the expression of critical target 
genes.Significance: The gene regulation mechanisms that drive medulloblastoma 
are not well understood. Using chromatin profiling, we find that the 
transcription factor OTX2 acts as a pioneer factor and, in cooperation with 
NEUROD1, controls the Group 3 medulloblastoma active enhancer landscape. OTX2 
itself or its target genes, including the mitotic kinase NEK2, represent 
attractive targets for future therapies. Cancer Discov; 7(3); 288-301. ©2017
