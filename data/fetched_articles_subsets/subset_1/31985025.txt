Ligustrazine has been used to alleviate clinical acute kidney injury (AKI); 
however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In order to 
further elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying its occurrence, the role of 
nucleotide‑binding oligomerization domain‑containing 2 (NOD2) in AKI was 
investigated in the present study, and the results indicated that ligustrazine 
exerts an important protective effect against AKI in vivo by inhibiting the 
upregulation of NOD2 expression and reducing apoptosis of kidney cells following 
ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat models. Furthermore, the inhibitory role of 
ligustrazine on the upregulation of NOD2 and apoptosis of kidney cells induced 
by CoCl2 and oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation was 
investigated in in vitro experiments. The effect of ligustrazine on NOD2 
downregulation was partially blocked by inhibiting autophagy. To the best of our 
knowledge, the results of the present study are the first to provide evidence 
that ligustrazine can inhibit NOD2‑mediated inflammation to protect against 
renal injury, which may be in part attributed to the induction of autophagy. 
These findings may help design and develop new approaches and therapeutic 
strategies for AKI to prevent the deterioration of renal function.
