BACKGROUND: The P2X(7) receptor plays an important role in cytokine release 
during the inflammatory response in vivo. Polymorphisms within the P2X(7) 
receptor gene that lead to loss of receptor function may contribute to impaired 
cytokine release by immune cells. Therefore, we investigated whether a known 
loss-of-function polymorphism (Glu496Ala) in the P2X(7) receptor gene leads to 
alterations in cytokine release in response to ATP.
RESULTS: An ex vivo whole blood model was used to induce an inflammatory 
reaction with the pro-inflammatory stimuli LPS and PHA (phytohemagglutinin). 
Blood from n=9 subjects with the Glu496Ala P2X7 SNP (P2X7MUT) and n=7 
'wild-type' subjects (no P2X7 SNP; P2X7WT) was used.Addition of ATP (0.9-3 mM) 
to LPS/PHA-stimulated whole blood induced an increase in IL-1β release in 
P2X7MUT subjects, whereas decreased release was observed in P2X7WT subjects. 
Decreased levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in response to ATP were shown in both P2X7MUT 
and P2X7WT subjects, which was less pronounced in P2X7MUT subjects. ATP at 3 mM 
also significantly decreased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in P2X7MUT 
subjects compared to P2X7WT subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the non-synonymous Glu496Ala loss-of-function 
polymorphism within the P2X(7) receptor gene is likely to be of importance in 
the release of cytokines during inflammation. Furthermore, this study suggests 
that carriers of the Glu496Ala loss-of-function polymorphism are protected 
against the cytotoxic effects of high ATP-levels.
