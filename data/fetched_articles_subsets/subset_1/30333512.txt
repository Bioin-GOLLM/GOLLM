New therapeutic targets for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) are critically 
needed. Our laboratory recently performed an insertional mutagenesis screen in 
mice to identify novel CRC driver genes and, thus, potential drug targets. Here, 
we define Transmembrane 9 Superfamily 2 (TM9SF2) as a novel CRC oncogene. TM9SF2 
is an understudied protein, belonging to a well conserved protein family 
characterized by their nine putative transmembrane domains. Based on our 
transposon screen we found that TM9SF2 is a candidate progression driver in 
digestive tract tumors. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data revealed 
that approximately 35% of CRC patients have elevated levels of TM9SF2 mRNA, data 
we validated using an independent set of CRC samples. RNAi silencing of TM9SF2 
reduced CRC cell growth in an anchorage-independent manner, a hallmark of 
cancer. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of TM9SF2 substantially diminished CRC 
tumor fitness in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptome analysis of TM9SF2 knockout 
cells revealed a potential role for TM9SF2 in cell cycle progression, oxidative 
phosphorylation, and ceramide signaling. Lastly, we report that increased TM9SF2 
expression correlates with disease stage and low TM9SF2 expression correlate 
with a more favorable relapse-free survival. Taken together, this study provides 
evidence that TM9SF2 is a novel CRC oncogene.
