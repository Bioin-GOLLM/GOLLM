The exploitation of a cell's natural degradation machinery for therapeutic 
purposes is an exciting research area in its infancy with respect to bacteria. 
Here, we review current strategies targeting the ClpCP system, which is a 
proteolytic degradation complex essential in the biology of many bacterial 
species of scientific interest. Strategies include using natural product 
antibiotics or acyldepsipeptides to initiate the up- or down-regulation of ClpCP 
activity. We also examine exciting recent forays into BacPROTACs to trigger the 
degradation of specific proteins of interest through the hijacking of the ClpCP 
machinery. These strategies represent an important emerging avenue for 
combatting antimicrobial resistance.
