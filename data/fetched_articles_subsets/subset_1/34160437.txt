RATIONALE: Autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia type 1 (ADH1) is a genetic disease 
characterized by benign hypocalcemia, inappropriately low parathyroid hormone 
levels and mostly hypercalciuria. It is caused by the activating mutations of 
the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR), which produces a left-shift in the set 
point for extracellular calcium.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 50-year-old man presenting with muscle spasms was admitted 
into the hospital. He has a positive familial history for hypocalcemia. 
Auxiliary examinations demonstrated hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, normal 
parathyroid hormone level and nephrolithiasis. A missense heterozygous variant 
in CASR, c 613C > T (p. Arg205Cys) which has been reported in a familial 
hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 patient was found in the patient's genotype. 
It is the first time that this variant is found associating with ADH1. The 
variant is predicted vicious by softwares and cosegregates with ADH1 in this 
pedigree. CASR Arg205Cys was deduced to be the genetic cause of ADH1 in the 
family.
DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with ADH1 clinically and genetically.
INTERVENTIONS: Oral calcitriol, calcium and hydrochlorothiazide were prescribed 
to the patient.
OUTCOMES: After the treatments for 1 week, the patient's symptom was improved 
and the re-examination revealed serum calcium in the normal range. A 3-month 
follow-up showed his symptom was mostly relieved.
LESSONS: The variant of CASR Arg205Cys, responsible for ADH1 in this family, 
broadened the genetic spectrum of ADH1. Further and more studies are required to 
evaluate the correlation between genotype and phenotype in ADH1 patients.
