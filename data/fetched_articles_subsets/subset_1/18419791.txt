Nogo/reticulon (RTN)-4 has been strongly implicated as a disease marker for the 
motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Nogo isoforms, 
including Nogo-A, are ectopically expressed in the skeletal muscle of ALS mouse 
models and patients and their levels correlate with the disease severity. The 
notion of a direct involvement of Nogo-A in ALS aetiology is supported by the 
findings that Nogo-A deletion in mice reduces muscle denervation and prolongs 
survival, whereas overexpression of Nogo-A destabilizes motor nerve terminals 
and promotes denervation. Another intriguing, and somewhat paradoxical, recent 
finding revealed that binding of the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) by either agonistic 
or antagonistic Nogo-66-derived peptides protects against p75 neurotrophin 
receptor (p75(NTR))-dependent motor neuron death. Ligand binding by NgR could 
result in subsequent engagement of p75(NTR), and this association could preclude 
pro-apoptotic signalling by the latter. Understanding the intricate interplay 
among Nogo isoforms, NgR and p75(NTR) in ALS disease progression may provide 
important, therapeutically exploitable information.
