Cells utilize transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms to alter gene 
expression in response to environmental cues. Gene-specific controls, including 
changing the translation of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), provide a rapid 
means to respond precisely to different conditions. Upstream open reading frames 
(uORFs) are known to control the translation of mRNAs. Recent studies in 
bacteria and eukaryotes have revealed the functions of evolutionarily conserved 
uORF-encoded peptides. Some of these uORF-encoded nascent peptides enable 
responses to specific metabolites to modulate the translation of their mRNAs by 
stalling ribosomes and through ribosome stalling may also modulate the level of 
their mRNAs. In this review, we highlight several examples of conserved uORF 
nascent peptides that stall ribosomes to regulate gene expression in response to 
specific metabolites in bacteria, fungi, mammals, and plants.
