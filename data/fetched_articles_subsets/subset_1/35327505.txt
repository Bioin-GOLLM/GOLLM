Metabolic function plays a key role in immune cell activation, destruction of 
foreign pathogens, and memory cell generation. As T cells are activated, their 
metabolic profile is significantly changed due to signaling cascades mediated by 
the T cell receptor (TCR) and co-receptors found on their surface. CD5 is a T 
cell co-receptor that regulates thymocyte selection and peripheral T cell 
activation. The removal of CD5 enhances T cell activation and proliferation, but 
how this is accomplished is not well understood. We examined how CD5 
specifically affects CD4+ T cell metabolic function and systemic metabolome by 
analyzing serum and T cell metabolites from CD5WT and CD5KO mice. We found that 
CD5 removal depletes certain serum metabolites, and CD5KO T cells have higher 
levels of several metabolites. Transcriptomic analysis identified several 
upregulated metabolic genes in CD5KO T cells. Bioinformatic analysis identified 
glycolysis and the TCA cycle as metabolic pathways promoted by CD5 removal. 
Functional metabolic analysis demonstrated that CD5KO T cells have higher oxygen 
consumption rates (OCR) and higher extracellular acidification rates (ECAR). 
Together, these findings suggest that the loss of CD5 is linked to CD4+ T cell 
metabolism changes in metabolic gene expression and metabolite concentration.
