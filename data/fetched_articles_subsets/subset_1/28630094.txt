During RBC transfusion, production of alloantibodies against RBC non-ABO Ags can 
cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and limit availability of compatible blood 
products, resulting in anemia-associated morbidity and mortality. Multiple 
studies have established that certain inflammatory disorders and inflammatory 
stimuli promote alloimmune responses to RBC Ags. However, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying these findings are poorly understood. Type I IFNs 
(IFN-α/β) are induced in inflammatory conditions associated with increased 
alloimmunization. By developing a new transgenic murine model, we demonstrate 
that signaling through the IFN-α/β receptor is required for inflammation-induced 
alloimmunization. Additionally, mitochondrial antiviral signaling 
protein-mediated signaling through cytosolic pattern recognition receptors was 
required for polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-induced IFN-α/β production and 
alloimmunization. We further report that IFN-α, in the absence of an adjuvant, 
is sufficient to induce RBC alloimmunization. These findings raise the 
possibility that patients with IFN-α/β-mediated conditions, including 
autoimmunity and viral infections, may have an increased risk of RBC 
alloimmunization and may benefit from personalized transfusion protocols and/or 
targeted therapies.
