The mucus obstructing the airways of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients is a yield 
stress fluid. Linear and non-linear rheological analyses of CF sputa can provide 
relevant biophysical markers, which could be used for the management of this 
disease. Sputa were collected from CF patients either without any induction or 
following an aerosol treatment with the recombinant human DNAse (rhDNAse, 
Pulmozyme®). Several sample preparations were considered and multiple 
measurements were performed in order to assess both the repeatability and the 
robustness of the rheological measurements. The linear and non-linear 
rheological properties of all CF sputa were characterized. While no correlation 
between oscillatory shear linear viscoelastic properties and clinical data was 
observed, the steady shear flow data showed that the apparent yield stress of 
sputum from CF patients previously treated with rhDNAse was approximately one 
decade lower than that of non-treated CF patients. Similar results were obtained 
with sputa from non-induced CF patients subjected ex vivo to a Pulmozyme® 
aerosol treatment. The results demonstrate that the apparent yield stress of 
patient sputa is a relevant predictive/prognostic biomarker in CF patients and 
could help in the development of new mucolytic agents.
