Objective To find out the frequency of hyperhomocysteinemia in young ischaemic 
stroke patients and its relationship with early morbidity and mortality. Methods 
This prospective study was conducted on young ischemic stroke patients in 
Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission General Hospital, Islamabad. Ischaemic stroke 
patients of age < 45 years were selected from both the outpatient and inpatient 
departments. A fasting venous blood sample was sent for analysis. Data was 
collected through a structured proforma and were analyzed using SPSS 24.0 (IBM 
Corp, Armonk, NY, US). The outcome was measured at discharge using the modified 
Rankin scale. Results The mean age of the 71 patients in the study was 35.8 
years. Overall, 36 (50.7%) cases had hyper-homocysteinemia. The frequency was 
significantly higher in males and in the age group 36-45 years (63.4%). Levels 
of homocysteine did not significantly affect the outcome at discharge. 
Conclusion Hyperhomocysteinaemia, a modifiable risk factor for ischaemic stroke, 
was seen in about half of young stroke patients. The levels of homocysteine did 
not correlate with early stroke outcome.
