OBJECTIVE: Heart failure (HF) imposes a substantial burden and the prevalence of 
HF is high in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). HF results in multiple 
hospital admissions, but whether HF subtypes worsen long-term outcomes and renal 
function in patients with CKD remains inconclusive.
METHODS: The study comprised 10 904 patients with CKD aged ≥20 years who 
underwent echocardiography between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2018. The 
patients were stratiﬁed into four groups: non-HF, HF with reduced ejection 
fraction (HFrEF), HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and HF with 
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The primary end points were all-cause 
mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and adverse renal 
outcomes.
RESULTS: In inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted method, the risk 
of all-cause mortality and MACEs relative to the non-HF group was greatest in 
the HFrEF group (HR 3.18 (95% CI 2.57 to 3.93) and HR 3.83 (95% CI 3.20 to 
4.59)), followed by the HFmrEF (HR 2.75 (95% CI 2.22 to 3.42) and HR 3.08 (95% 
CI 2.57 to 3.69)) and HFpEF (HR 1.85 (95% CI 1.59 to 2.15) and HR 2.43 (95% CI 
2.16 to 2.73) groups. In addition, the HFrEF group had the greatest risks of 
end-stage renal disease (HR 2.58 (95% CI 1.94 to 3.44)) compared with other 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: HF is associated with subsequent worse clinical outcomes, which may 
be more pronounced in patients with HFrEF, followed by those with HFmrEF and 
those with HFpEF relative to non-HF group.
