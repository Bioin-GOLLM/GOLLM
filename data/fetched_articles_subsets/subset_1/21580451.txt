In the title compound, C(20)H(16)O(5), the dihedral angle between the 
naphthalene ring system and the benzene ring is 67.43 (5)°. The bridging 
carbonyl C-C(=O)-C plane makes dihedral angles of 82.64 (6) and 41.79 (7)°, 
respectively, with the naphthalene ring system and the benzene ring. The 
dihedral angle between the carb-oxy O-C(=O)-C plane and the benzene ring is 
36.38 (7)° and that between the bridging carbonyl C-C(=O)-C plane and the 
carb-oxy O-C(=O)-C plane is 51.88 (8)°. The crystal structure is stabilized by 
inter-molecular O-H⋯O and C-H⋯O hydrogen-bonding inter-actions. An 
intra-molecular C-H⋯O hydrogen bond occurs between a naphthalene H atom and the 
carbonyl O atom of the carb-oxy group.
