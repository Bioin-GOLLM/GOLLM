BACKGROUND: Host-microbe balance maintains intestinal homeostasis and strongly 
influences inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). 
Here we focused on bacteria-fungi interactions and their implications on 
intestinal inflammation, a poorly understood area.
METHODS: Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis was assessed in mice 
treated with vancomycin (targeting gram-positive bacteria) or colistin 
(targeting Enterobacteriaceae) and supplemented with either Saccharomyces 
boulardii CNCM I-745 or Candida albicans. Inflammation severity as well as 
bacterial and fungal microbiota compositions was monitored.
RESULTS: While S. boulardii improved DSS-induced colitis and C. albicans 
worsened it in untreated settings, antibiotic treatment strongly modified DSS 
susceptibility and effects of fungi on colitis. Vancomycin-treated mice were 
fully protected from colitis, while colistin-treated mice retained colitis 
phenotype but were not affected anymore by administration of fungi. 
Antibacterial treatments not only influenced bacterial populations but also had 
indirect effects on fungal microbiota. Correlations between bacterial and fungal 
relative abundance were dramatically decreased in colistin-treated mice compared 
to vancomycin-treated and control mice, suggesting that colistin-sensitive 
bacteria are involved in interactions with fungi. Restoration of the 
Enterobacteriaceae population by administrating colistin-resistant Escherichia 
coli reestablished both beneficial effects of S. boulardii and pathogenic 
effects of C. albicans on colitis severity. This effect was at least partly 
mediated by an improved gut colonization by fungi.
CONCLUSIONS: Fungal colonization of the gut is affected by the 
Enterobacteriaceae population, indirectly modifying effects of mycobiome on the 
host. This finding provides new insights into the role of inter-kingdom 
functional interactions in intestinal physiopathology and potentially in IBD.
