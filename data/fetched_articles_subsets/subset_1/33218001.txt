Viral vectors can generate high levels of recombinant protein expression 
providing the basis for modern vaccine development. A large number of different 
viral vector expression systems have been utilized for targeting viral surface 
proteins and tumor-associated antigens. Immunization studies in preclinical 
animal models have evaluated the elicited humoral and cellular responses and the 
possible protection against challenges with lethal doses of infectious pathogens 
or tumor cells. Several vaccine candidates for both infectious diseases and 
various cancers have been subjected to a number of clinical trials. Human 
immunization trials have confirmed safe application of viral vectors, generation 
of neutralizing antibodies and protection against challenges with lethal doses. 
A special emphasis is placed on COVID-19 vaccines based on viral vectors. 
Likewise, the flexibility and advantages of applying viral particles, RNA 
replicons and DNA replicon vectors of self-replicating RNA viruses for vaccine 
development are presented.
