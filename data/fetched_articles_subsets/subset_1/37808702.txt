Altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer; however, it has been difficult to 
specifically target metabolism in cancer for therapeutic benefit. Cancers with 
genetically defined defects in metabolic enzymes constitute a subset of cancers 
where targeting metabolism is potentially accessible. HÃ¼rthle cell carcinoma of 
the thyroid (HTC) tumors frequently harbor deleterious mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
mutations in subunits of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain 
(ETC). Previous work has shown that HTC models with deleterious mtDNA mutations 
exhibit mitochondrial ETC defects that expose lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a 
therapeutic vulnerability. Here, we performed forward genetic screens to 
identify mechanisms of resistance to small molecule LDH inhibitors. We 
identified two distinct mechanisms of resistance: upregulation of an LDH isoform 
and a compound-specific resistance mutation. Using these tools, we demonstrate 
that the anti-cancer activity of LDH inhibitors in cell line and xenograft 
models of complex I-mutant HTC is through on-target LDH inhibition.
