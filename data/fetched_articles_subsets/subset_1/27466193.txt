Elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels are associated with higher risk 
of type 2 diabetes in observational studies, but the underlying causal 
relationship is still unclear. Here, we tested a hypothesis that GGT levels have 
a causal effect on type 2 diabetes risk using Mendelian randomization. Data were 
collected from 7640 participants in a South Korean population. In a single 
instrumental variable (IV) analysis using two stage least squares regression 
with the rs4820599 in the GGT1 gene region as an instrument, one unit of GGT 
levels (IU/L) was associated with 11% higher risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04 to 1.19). In a multiple IV 
analysis using seven genetic variants that have previously been demonstrated to 
be associated with GGT at a genome-wide level of significance, the corresponding 
estimate suggested a 2.6% increase in risk (OR = 1.026, 95% CI: 1.001 to 1.052). 
In a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using genetic associations with 
type 2 diabetes taken from a trans-ethnic GWAS study of 110 452 independent 
samples, the single IV analysis confirmed an association between the rs4820599 
and type 2 diabetes risk (P-value = 0.04); however, the estimate from the 
multiple IV analysis was compatible with the null (OR = 1.007, 95% CI: 0.993 to 
1.022) with considerable heterogeneity between the causal effects estimated 
using different genetic variants. Overall, there is weak genetic evidence that 
GGT levels may have a causal role in the development of type 2 diabetes.
