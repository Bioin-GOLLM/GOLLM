BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis is a common complication of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE, OMIM #15200) in the Asian population and a main contributor 
to mortality and morbidity. In this study, we evaluate the variants on three 
genes STAT4, CDKN1A, and IRF5 and their association with lupus nephritis.
METHOD: One hundred fifty-two SLE patients with confirmed lupus nephritis 
(through biopsy) and 76 healthy controls were recruited. Genotyping of SNPs on 
three gene STAT4, CDKN1A, and IRF5, phenotypic, and laboratory assessment were 
performed; renal biopsy and classification were carried out for the patient 
group.
RESULTS: Carriers of rs7582694 C alleles on STAT4 have higher risk of lupus 
nephritis (OR 2.0; 95% CI [1.14, 3.19]; p = 0.015), at higher risk of hematuria 
and higher serum level of dsDNA antibodies compared to controls (p < 0.05) and 
were more likely to have nephrotic histopathology grading of class III or 
higher. No association was observed for CDKN1A; and no variation was observed 
for the IRF5 gene in both the study and control group.
CONCLUSION: This study investigates the relationship between STAT4, CDKN1A, and 
IRF5 gene and SLE in a Vietnamese patient population. Patients with the C allele 
(STAT4) in rs7582694 were associated with a more severe disease phenotype.
