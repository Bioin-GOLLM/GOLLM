Recurrent pathogenic variants have been detected in several breast and ovarian 
cancer (BC/OC) risk genes in the Finnish population. We conducted a gene-panel 
sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis to define a more comprehensive 
spectrum of pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, BARD1, 
RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1, and FANCM genes in Finnish BC patients. The combined 
frequency of pathogenic variants in the BRCA1/2 genes was 1.8% in 1356 
unselected patients, whereas variants in the other genes were detected 
altogether in 8.3% of 1356 unselected patients and in 12.9% of 699 familial 
patients. CNVs were detected in 0.3% of both 1137 unselected and 612 familial 
patients. A few variants covered most of the pathogenic burden in the studied 
genes. Of the BRCA1/2 carriers, 70.8% had 1 of 10 recurrent variants. In the 
other genes combined, 92.1% of the carrier patients had at least 1 of 11 
recurrent variants. In particular, PALB2 c.1592delT and CHEK2 c.1100delC 
accounted for 88.9% and 82.9%, respectively, of the pathogenic variation in each 
gene. Our results highlight the importance of founder variants in the BC risk 
genes in the Finnish population and could be used in the designing of population 
screening for the risk variants.
