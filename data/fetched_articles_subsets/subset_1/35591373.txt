Lithium-rich disordered rocksalt Li2TiS3 offers large discharge capacities (>350 
mAh·g−1) and can be considered a promising cathode material for high-energy 
lithium-ion battery applications. However, the quick fading of the specific 
capacity results in a poor cycle life of the system, especially when liquid 
electrolyte-based batteries are used. Our efforts to solve the cycling stability 
problem resulted in the discovery of new high-energy selenium-substituted 
materials (Li2TiSexS3−x), which were prepared using a wet mechanochemistry 
process. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that all compositions were 
obtained in cation-disordered rocksalt phase and that the lattice parameters 
were expanded by selenium substitution. Substituted materials delivered large 
reversible capacities, with smaller average potentials, and their cycling 
stability was superior compared to Li2TiS3 upon cycling at a rate of C/10 
between 3.0−1.6 V vs. Li+/Li.
