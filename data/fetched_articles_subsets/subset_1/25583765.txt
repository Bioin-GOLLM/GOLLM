The activating BRAF mutation p.V600E has been identified in many cancers, 
including colon and lung adenocarcinomas, papillary thyroid cancer, malignant 
melanoma, and hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Malignant melanoma and HCL are of 
particular interest because of both the high proportion of cases harboring the 
mutation and the dramatic responses to BRAF inhibitor therapy reported in the 
literature. This report presents a patient with HCL and malignant melanoma with 
the BRAF p.V600E mutation, and discusses the successful treatment of both 
cancers with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib.
