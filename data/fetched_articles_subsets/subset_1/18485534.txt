Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is a neurodegenerative disease that 
selectively affects the peripheral nervous system. The putative cause of this 
life threatening pathology is tissue deposition of mutant transthyretin (TTR), 
initially as non-fibrillar deposits and later as fibrillar material. The mouse 
models currently available do not recapitulate the human whole features, since 
the peripheral nervous tissue is spared. We have characterized a new mouse model 
expressing the human transthyretin V30M in a heat shock transcription factor 1 
(Hsf1) null background. The lack of HSF1 expression leads to an extensive and 
earlier non-fibrillar TTR, evolving into fibrillar material in distinct organs 
including the peripheral nervous system. Furthermore, inflammatory stress and a 
reduction in unmyelinated nerve fibers were observed, as in human patients. 
These results indicate that HSF1 regulated genes are involved in FAP, modulating 
TTR tissue deposition. The novel mouse model is of the utmost importance in 
testing new therapeutic strategies and in addressing the influence of the stress 
response in misfolding diseases.
