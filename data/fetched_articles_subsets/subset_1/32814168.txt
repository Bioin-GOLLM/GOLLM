Stress granules (SGs) are assemblies of mRNA and proteins that form from mRNAs 
stalled in translation initiation in response to stress. Chronic stress might 
even induce formation of cytotoxic pathological SGs. SGs participate in various 
biological functions including response to apoptosis, inflammation, immune 
modulation, and signalling pathways; moreover, SGs are involved in pathogenesis 
of neurodegenerative diseases, viral infection, aging, cancers and many other 
diseases. Emerging evidence has shown that small molecules can affect SG 
dynamics, including assembly, disassembly, maintenance and clearance. Thus, 
targeting SGs is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human 
diseases and the promotion of health. The established methods for detecting SGs 
provided ready tools for large-scale screening of agents that alter the dynamics 
of SGs. Here, we describe the effects of small molecules on SG assembly, 
disassembly, and their roles in the disease. Moreover, we provide perspective 
for the possible application of small molecules targeting SGs in the treatment 
of human diseases.
