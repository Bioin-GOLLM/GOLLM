Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) is a unique member of the TRPM 
protein family and, similarly to TRPM5, is Ca2+ sensitive and permeable for 
monovalent but not divalent cations. It is widely expressed in many organs and 
is involved in several functions; it regulates membrane potential and Ca2+ 
homeostasis in both excitable and non-excitable cells. This part of the review 
discusses the currently available knowledge about the physiological and 
pathophysiological roles of TRPM4 in various tissues. These include the 
physiological functions of TRPM4 in the cells of the Langerhans islets of the 
pancreas, in various immune functions, in the regulation of vascular tone, in 
respiratory and other neuronal activities, in chemosensation, and in renal and 
cardiac physiology. TRPM4 contributes to pathological conditions such as 
overactive bladder, endothelial dysfunction, various types of malignant diseases 
and central nervous system conditions including stroke and injuries as well as 
in cardiac conditions such as arrhythmias, hypertrophy, and ischemia-reperfusion 
injuries. TRPM4 claims more and more attention and is likely to be the topic of 
research in the future.
