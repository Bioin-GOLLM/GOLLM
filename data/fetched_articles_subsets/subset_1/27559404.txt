This review highlights the biosynthesis of heterocycles in polyketide natural 
products with a focus on oxygen and nitrogen-containing heterocycles with ring 
sizes between 3 and 6 atoms. Heterocycles are abundant structural elements of 
natural products from all classes and they often contribute significantly to 
their biological activity. Progress in recent years has led to a much better 
understanding of their biosynthesis. In this context, plenty of novel enzymology 
has been discovered, suggesting that these pathways are an attractive target for 
future studies.
