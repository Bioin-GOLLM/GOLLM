Hypoglycemia is well-recognized to limit the degree of glycemic control possible 
for many individuals for diabetes. Although the likelihood of hypoglycemia 
increases as A1c levels decrease in type 1 diabetes, insulin-treated type 2 
diabetic persons with higher A1c appear paradoxically to have more hypoglycemia 
which may explain, in part, the adverse outcome reported in the ACCORD study. 
Approaches to glucose-lowering that cause lesser degrees of risk for 
hypoglycemia, technologies to better ascertain hypoglycemic events, and better 
understanding of patient characteristics associated with greater likelihood of 
hypoglycemia will all be required to reduce this limiting factor in optimizing 
glycemic treatment.
