OBJECTIVE: Cell-surface localization and intracellular trafficking are essential 
for the function of ATP-binding cassette transporter A-1 (ABCA1). However, 
regulation of these activities is still largely unknown. Brefeldin A, an 
uncompetitive inhibitor of brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange 
proteins (BIGs), disturbs the intracellular distribution of ABCA1, and thus 
inhibits cholesterol efflux. This study aimed to define the possible roles of 
BIGs in regulating ABCA1 trafficking and cholesterol efflux, and further to 
explore the potential mechanism.
METHODS AND RESULTS: By vesicle immunoprecipitation, we found that BIG1 was 
associated with ABCA1 in vesicles preparation from rat liver. BIG1 depletion 
reduced surface ABCA1 on HepG2 cells, and inhibited by 60% cholesterol release. 
In contrast, BIG1 overexpression increased surface ABCA1 and cholesterol 
secretion. With partial restoration of BIG1 through overexpression in 
BIG1-depleted cells, surface ABCA1 was also restored. Biotinylation and 
glutathione cleavage revealed that BIG1 small interfering RNA dramatically 
decreased the internalization and recycling of ABCA1. This novel function of 
BIG1 was dependent on the guanine nucleotide-exchange activity and achieved 
through activation of ADP-ribosylation factor 1.
CONCLUSIONS: BIG1, through its ability to activate ADP-ribosylation factor 1, 
regulates cell-surface levels and function of ABCA1, indicating a 
transcription-independent mechanism for controlling ABCA1 action.
