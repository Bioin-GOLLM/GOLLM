Cells are continuously exposed to potentially dangerous compounds. Progressive 
accumulation of damage is suspected to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases 
and aging, but the molecular identity of the damage remains largely unknown. 
Here we report that PARK7, an enzyme mutated in hereditary Parkinson's disease, 
prevents damage of proteins and metabolites caused by a metabolite of 
glycolysis. We found that the glycolytic metabolite 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate 
(1,3-BPG) spontaneously forms a novel reactive intermediate that avidly reacts 
with amino groups. PARK7 acts by destroying this intermediate, thereby 
preventing the formation of proteins and metabolites with glycerate and 
phosphoglycerate modifications on amino groups. As a consequence, inactivation 
of PARK7 (or its orthologs) in human cell lines, mouse brain, and Drosophila 
melanogaster leads to the accumulation of these damaged compounds, most of which 
have not been described before. Our work demonstrates that PARK7 function 
represents a highly conserved strategy to prevent damage in cells that 
metabolize carbohydrates. This represents a fundamental link between metabolism 
and a type of cellular damage that might contribute to the development of 
Parkinson's disease.
