Ras oncoproteins are small molecular weight GTPases known for their involvement 
in oncogenesis, which operate in a complex signaling network with multiple 
effectors. Approximately 25% of human tumors possess mutations in a member of 
this family. The Raf1/MEK/Erk1/2 pathway is one of the most intensively studied 
signaling mechanisms. Different levels of regulation account for the 
inactivation of MAP kinases by MAPK phosphatases in a cell type- and 
stimuli-dependent manner. In the present study, using three inducible 
Ras-expressing NIH/3T3 cell lines, we demonstrated that MKP3 upregulation 
requires the activation of the Erk1/2 pathway, which correlates with the 
shutdown of this pathway. We also demonstrated, by applying pharmacological 
inhibitors and effector mutants of Ras, that induction of MKP3 at the protein 
level is positively regulated by the oncogenic Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk1/2 signaling 
pathway. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(7): 370-375].
