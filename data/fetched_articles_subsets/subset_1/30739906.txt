MYH9 was first discovered due to thrombocytopenia caused by MYH9 
mutation-related abnormalities. In recent years, researchers have increasingly 
found that MYH9 plays an important role in cancer as a cytokine involved in 
cytoskeletal reorganization, cellular pseudopodia formation, and migration. MYH9 
is closely related to the progress and poor prognosis of most solid tumors, and 
it is now accepted that MYH9 is a suppressor gene and plays an important role on 
the re-Rho pathway. Recent research has been limited to the study of tissues. 
However, it would be more direct and informative to be able to use hematology to 
assess tumor prognosis and changes in MYH9 levels and NMMHC-IIA. This article 
summarizes recent research on MYH9 and provides a reference for future clinical 
research.
