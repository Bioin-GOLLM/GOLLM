The hereditary ataxias are a complex group of neurological disorders 
characterized by the degeneration of the cerebellum and its associated 
connections. The molecular mechanisms that trigger the loss of Purkinje cells in 
this group of diseases remain incompletely understood. Here, we report a 
previously undescribed dominant mouse model of cerebellar ataxia, moonwalker 
(Mwk), that displays motor and coordination defects and loss of cerebellar 
Purkinje cells. Mwk mice harbor a gain-of-function mutation (T635A) in the Trpc3 
gene encoding the nonselective transient receptor potential cation channel, type 
C3 (TRPC3), resulting in altered TRPC3 channel gating. TRPC3 is highly expressed 
in Purkinje cells during the phase of dendritogenesis. Interestingly, growth and 
differentiation of Purkinje cell dendritic arbors are profoundly impaired in Mwk 
mice. Our findings define a previously unknown role for TRPC3 in both dendritic 
development and survival of Purkinje cells, and provide a unique mechanism 
underlying cerebellar ataxia.
