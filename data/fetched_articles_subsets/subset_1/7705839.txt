X-linked sideroblastic anemia is a genetic disorder characterized by a 
hypochromic microcytic anemia of variable intensity with the presence of ring 
sideroblasts in the bone marrow of the patients. Two different mutations have 
been reported in the ALAS2 gene in patients with this disease. We have studied a 
large kindred with a pyridoxine-sensitive form of X-linked sideroblastic anemia. 
Sequencing amplified cDNA of the proband revealed a guanine-to-adenine change at 
nucleotide 871 of the coding sequence (exon 7 of the gene). This results in a 
glycine to serine substitution that is responsible for a marked decrease in the 
enzymatic activity of the mutated protein. A polymerase chain reaction assay 
demonstrated the presence of the same mutation in three affected males and two 
female carriers in the kindred. The carrier status was excluded in eight females 
at risk. Early detection of the mutant allele in family members may thus be 
important for the prevention of anemia in males and of iron overload both in 
affected males and carrier females.
