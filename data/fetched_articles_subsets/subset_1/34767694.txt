AIMS: This study aimed to explore the pathomechanism of a mutation on the 
leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 gene (LGI1) identified in a family having 
autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTE), using a precise 
knock-in mouse model.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A novel LGI1 mutation, c.152A>G; p. Asp51Gly, was 
identified by whole exome sequencing in a Chinese family with ADLTE. The 
pathomechanism of the mutation was explored by generating Lgi1D51G knock-in mice 
that precisely phenocopied the epileptic symptoms of human patients. The 
Lgi1D51G/D51G mice showed spontaneous recurrent generalized seizures and 
premature death. The Lgi1D51G/+ mice had partial epilepsy, with half of them 
displaying epileptiform discharges on electroencephalography. They also showed 
enhanced sensitivity to the convulsant agent pentylenetetrazole. 
Mechanistically, the secretion of Lgi1 was impaired in the brain of the D51G 
knock-in mice and the protein level was drastically reduced. Moreover, the 
antiepileptic drugs, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and sodium valproate, could 
prolong the survival time of Lgi1D51G/D51G mice, and oxcarbazepine appeared to 
be the most effective.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel epilepsy-causing mutation of LGI1 in humans. 
The Lgi1D51G/+ mouse model, precisely phenocopying epileptic symptoms of human 
patients, could be a useful tool in future studies on the pathogenesis and 
potential therapies for epilepsy.
