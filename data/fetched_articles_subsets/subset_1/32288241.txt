We recently reported the successful use of the loop-mediated isothermal 
amplification (LAMP) reaction for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA amplification and 
its optimal primer design method. In this study, we report the development of an 
integrated isothermal device for both amplification and detection of targeted 
HBV DNA. It has two major components, a disposable polymethyl methacrylate 
(PMMA) micro-reactor and a temperature-regulated optical detection unit (base 
apparatus) for real-time monitoring of the turbidity changes due to the 
precipitation of DNA amplification by-product, magnesium pyrophosphate. We have 
established a correlation curve (R 2 = 0.99) between the concentration of 
pyrophosphate ions and the level of turbidity by using a simulated chemical 
reaction to evaluate the characteristics of our device. For the applications of 
rapid pathogens detection, we also have established a standard curve (R 
2 = 0.96) by using LAMP reaction with a standard template in our device. 
Moreover, we also have successfully used the device on seven clinical serum 
specimens where HBV DNA levels have been confirmed by real-time PCR. The result 
indicates that different amounts of HBV DNA can be successfully detected by 
using this device within 1 h.
