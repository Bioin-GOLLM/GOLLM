BACKGROUND: Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4; MIM 
604270) modulates WNT/β-catenin signaling, through its binding of WNT ligands, 
and to co-receptors LRP5/6, and WNT inhibitors DKK1, SOSTDC1, and SOST. LRP4 
binds to SOSTDC1 and WNT proteins establishing a negative feedback loop between 
Wnt/β-catenin, Bmp, and Shh signaling during the bud and cap stages of tooth 
development. Consistent with a critical role for this complex in developing 
teeth, mice lacking Lrp4 or Sostdc1 have multiple dental anomalies including 
supernumerary incisors and molars. However, there is limited evidence supporting 
variants in LRP4 in human dental pathologies.
METHODS: We clinically, radiographically, and molecularly investigated 94 Thai 
patients with mesiodens. Lrp4 mutant mice were generated in order to study the 
effects of aberrant Lrp4 expression in mice.
RESULTS: Whole exome and Sanger sequencing identified three extremely rare 
variants (c.4154A>G, p.Asn1385Ser; c.3940G>A, p.Gly1314Ser; and c.448G>A, 
p.Asp150Asn) in LRP4 in seven patients with mesiodens. Two patients had oral 
exostoses and two patients had root maldevelopments. Supernumerary incisors were 
observed in Lrp4 mutant mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study implicates heterozygous genetic variants in LRP4 as 
contributing factors in the presentation of mesiodens, root maldevelopments, and 
oral exostoses, possibly as a result of altered WNT/β-catenin-BMP-SHH signaling.
