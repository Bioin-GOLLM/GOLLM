BACKGROUND: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of 
diabetes mellitus.
AIMS: To identify the genetic basis in a family with 3 generations of diabetes 
and to assess the concordance between the genotype and phenotype.
METHODS: A molecular analysis was performed on genomic DNA using polymerase 
chain reaction, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and sequencing. A 
mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) was performed with/without glibenclamide. 
Abdominal ultrasonography was performed on all family members with diabetes due 
to the location of the mutation.
RESULTS: A novel c.618G>A, p.W206X termination mutation was identified in the 
hepatic nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) gene. The mutation was identified in the 
proband and 8 of the 14 family members tested. An MMTT stimulus (±2.5 and 5 mg 
glibenclamide) produced a similar glucose profile and C-peptide graph in both 
the obese proband and her nonobese mother, showing no effect of the 
glibenclamide. No evidence of liver adenomas was found in the abdominal 
ultrasonography.
CONCLUSIONS: We described a novel c.618G>A, p.W206X mutation in HNF1α associated 
with MODY 3 but not with hepatocellular adenoma. In contradistinction to most 
MODY 3 mutations, treatment with sulphonylurea was found to be a clinically 
ineffective alternative to insulin therapy.
