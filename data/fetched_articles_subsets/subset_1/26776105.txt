The highly conserved bacterial homospermidine synthase (HSS) is a key enzyme of 
the polyamine metabolism of many proteobacteria including pathogenic strains 
such as Legionella pneumophila and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; The unique usage of 
NAD(H) as a prosthetic group is a common feature of bacterial HSS, eukaryotic 
HSS and deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS). The structure of the bacterial enzyme does 
not possess a lysine residue in the active center and thus does not form an 
enzyme-substrate Schiff base intermediate as observed for the DHS. In contrast 
to the DHS the active site is not formed by the interface of two subunits but 
resides within one subunit of the bacterial HSS. Crystal structures of 
Blastochloris viridis HSS (BvHSS) reveal two distinct substrate binding sites, 
one of which is highly specific for putrescine. BvHSS features a side pocket in 
the direct vicinity of the active site formed by conserved amino acids and a 
potential substrate discrimination, guiding, and sensing mechanism. The proposed 
reaction steps for the catalysis of BvHSS emphasize cation-Ï€ interaction through 
a conserved Trp residue as a key stabilizer of high energetic transition states.
