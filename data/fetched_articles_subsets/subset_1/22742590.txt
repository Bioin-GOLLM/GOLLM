Medulloblastoma (MB) is a cancer of the cerebellum and the most common primary 
pediatric malignancy of the central nervous system. Classified as a primitive 
neural ectoderm tumor; it is thought to arise from granule cell precursors in 
the cerebellum. The standard of care consists of surgery, chemotherapy and 
age-dependent radiation therapy. Despite aggressive multimodality therapy; 
approximately 30% of MB patients remain incurable. Moreover, for long-term 
survivors, the treatment related sequelae are often debilitating. Side effects 
include cerebellar mutism, sterility, neurocognitive deficits, and a substantial 
risk of developing secondary cancers. In a quest for more effective and targeted 
therapies, scientists have begun to investigate the biological events that not 
only initiate but also sustain the malignant phenotype in MB. Of particular 
interest is, the role of the tumor microenvironment in tumor pathogenesis. This 
review seeks to highlight several key processes observed in cancer biology, 
particularly the involvement of the tumor microenvironment, with relevant 
examples from MB.
