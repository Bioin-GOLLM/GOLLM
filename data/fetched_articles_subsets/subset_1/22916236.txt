Activation induced deaminase (AID) deaminates cytosine to uracil, which is 
required for a functional humoral immune system. Previous work demonstrated, 
that AID also deaminates 5-methylcytosine (5 mC). Recently, a novel vertebrate 
modification (5-hydroxymethylcytosine - 5 hmC) has been implicated in 
functioning in epigenetic reprogramming, yet no molecular pathway explaining the 
removal of 5 hmC has been identified. AID has been suggested to deaminate 5 hmC, 
with the 5 hmU product being repaired by base excision repair pathways back to 
cytosine. Here we demonstrate that AID's enzymatic activity is inversely 
proportional to the electron cloud size of C5-cytosine - H > F > methyl >> 
hydroxymethyl. This makes AID an unlikely candidate to be part of 5 hmC removal.
