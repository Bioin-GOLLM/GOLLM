BACKGROUND: The spleen is an important contributor to the uncontrolled, 
excessive release of proinflammatory signals during sepsis that leads to the 
development of tissue injury and diffuse end-organ dysfunction. Therapeutic 
pulsed ultrasound (pUS) has been shown to inhibit splenic leukocyte release and 
reduce cytokine production in other inflammatory disease processes. We 
hypothesized that pUS treatment inhibits spleen-derived inflammatory responses 
and increases survival duration in rats with severe intra-abdominal sepsis 
leading to septic shock.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats with intra-abdominal sepsis, induced by cecal 
ligation and incision, underwent abdominal washout, intra-peritoneal 
administration of cefazolin, and then either no further treatment (control), 
splenectomy, or pUS of the spleen. Animals were observed for the primary 
endpoint of survival duration.
RESULTS: Survival curves were significantly different for all groups (P < 0.01). 
Median survival increased from 9.5 h in control rats to 19.8 h in pUS rats and 
35.0 h in splenectomy rats (P < 0.01). At 4 h after cecal ligation and incision, 
the pUS group had decreased splenic contraction and leukocyte count (P = 0.03) 
compared with control, indicating reduced exodus of splenic leukocytes. In 
addition, elevation in plasma TNF-α and MCP-1 was significantly attenuated in 
the pUS group (P < 0.05 versus control). Splenic β2 adrenergic receptor levels 
and phosphorylated Akt were significantly more elevated in the pUS group 
(P < 0.01 versus control).
CONCLUSIONS: pUS significantly prolonged the survival duration of rats with 
severe intra-abdominal sepsis. This treatment may be an effective, noninvasive 
therapy that dampens detrimental immune responses during septic shock by 
activating β2 adrenergic receptor-Akt phosphorylation in the cholinergic 
anti-inflammatory pathway.
