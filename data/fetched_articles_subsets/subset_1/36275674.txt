Histamine (HA) is a potent mediator that plays a central role in inflammation 
and allergy, acting through four G-protein-coupled receptors (i.e. H1-H4). HA is 
an accepted promoter of type 2 immunity in CD4+ T cells during hypersensitivity. 
Previously, we demonstrated that HA can promote antigen cross-presentation, 
inducing the activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in an asthmatic murine 
model. Non-classical CD8+ T-cell profiles, such as Tc2 or Tc17, are associated 
with allergic disease persistence and chronicity. In this paper, we focus on the 
role of the H3 receptor (H3R) and the H4 receptor (H4R) in the development of 
allergic contact dermatitis. We were able to show that induction of the type 2 
profiles associated with interleukin 13 production, both by CD4 and CD8 
lymphocytes, depend on the interaction of HA with H3R and H4R. Blocking both 
receptors using the selective H3/H4 receptor antagonist thioperamide or the 
selective H4R ligand JNJ777120 reduces the inflammatory response, inducing an 
immunosuppressive profile associated with the increased proportion of FOXp3+ 
regulatory T lymphocytes and CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid suppressor cells. 
Interestingly, in dendritic cells, only H4R blockade, and not H3R blockade, is 
capable of modulating most of the inflammatory effects observed in our model.
