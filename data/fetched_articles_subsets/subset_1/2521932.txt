A girl aged 12 y, 9 mo, suffered from a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
marked by ataxia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and convulsions. A skin biopsy showed 
axonal pathology that emphasized axonal segments enlarged by mitochondria, dense 
bodies, and lysosomal residual bodies of the membranous cytoplasmic body type. 
This ultrastructural pathology suggested GM2 gangliosidosis which was shown to 
be a B1 variant by specific biochemical studies, although conventional 
techniques had failed to detect GM2 gangliosidosis. The B1 variant is marked by 
a deficient activity of beta-hexosaminidase A towards one substrate, and by an 
almost normal activity towards another. Both parents showed a diminished 
activity towards the sulfated substrate, suggesting a heterozygous state, and 
almost normal activity with the second substrate type.
