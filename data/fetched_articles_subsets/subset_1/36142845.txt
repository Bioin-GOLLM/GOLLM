Ribosomal silencing factor S (RsfS) is a conserved protein that plays a role in 
the mechanisms of ribosome shutdown and cell survival during starvation. Recent 
studies demonstrated the involvement of RsfS in the biogenesis of the large 
ribosomal subunit. RsfS binds to the uL14 ribosomal protein on the large 
ribosomal subunit and prevents its association with the small subunit. Here, we 
estimated the contribution of RsfS amino acid side chains at the interface 
between RsfS and uL14 to RsfS anti-association function in Staphylococcus aureus 
through in vitro experiments: centrifugation in sucrose gradient profiles and an 
S. aureus cell-free system assay. The detected critical Y98 amino acid on the 
RsfS surface might become a new potential target for pharmacological drug 
development and treatment of S. aureus infections.
