Natural polymers, such as alginate and gelatin, can be used to produce scaffolds 
for tissue engineering applications; but, their mechanical and biochemical 
performance should be improved. A possible solution to obtain this result, is 
the generation of multi-component scaffolds, by blending two or more polymers. 
One way to realize it, is the formation of an interpenetrating polymer network 
(IPN). In this work, the interpenetration of alginate and gelatin hydrogels has 
been successfully obtained and preserved by supercritical CO₂ (SC-CO₂) drying 
performed at 200 bar and 35 °C, using different blend compositions: from 
alginate/gelatin = 20:80 v/v to alginate/gelatin = 80:20 v/v. The process 
allowed modulation of morphology and mechanical properties of these blends. The 
overall result was made possible by the supercritical drying process that, 
working at zero surface tension, allows preserving the hydrogels nanostructure 
in the corresponding aerogels.
