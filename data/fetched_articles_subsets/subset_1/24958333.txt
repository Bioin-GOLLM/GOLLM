Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the causative agent of end-stage liver disease. 
Recent advances in the last decade in anti HCV treatment strategies have 
dramatically increased the viral clearance rate. However, several limitations 
are still associated, which warrant a great need of novel, safe and selective 
drugs against HCV infection. Towards this objective, we explored highly potent 
and selective small molecule inhibitors, the ellagitannins, from the crude 
extract of Pomegranate (Punica granatum) fruit peel. The pure compounds, 
punicalagin, punicalin, and ellagic acid isolated from the extract specifically 
blocked the HCV NS3/4A protease activity in vitro. Structural analysis using 
computational approach also showed that ligand molecules interact with the 
catalytic and substrate binding residues of NS3/4A protease, leading to 
inhibition of the enzyme activity. Further, punicalagin and punicalin 
significantly reduced the HCV replication in cell culture system. More 
importantly, these compounds are well tolerated ex vivo and'no observed adverse 
effect level' (NOAEL) was established upto an acute dose of 5000â€…mg/kg in BALB/c 
mice. Additionally, pharmacokinetics study showed that the compounds are 
bioavailable. Taken together, our study provides a proof-of-concept approach for 
the potential use of antiviral and non-toxic principle ellagitannins from 
pomegranate in prevention and control of HCV induced complications.
