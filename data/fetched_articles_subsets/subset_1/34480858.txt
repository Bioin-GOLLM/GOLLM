BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccine supply shortages are causing concerns about 
compromised immunity in some countries as the interval between the first and 
second dose becomes longer. Conversely, countries with no supply constraints are 
considering administering a third dose. We assessed the persistence of 
immunogenicity after a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), immunity after 
an extended interval (44-45 weeks) between the first and second dose, and 
response to a third dose as a booster given 28-38 weeks after the second dose.
METHODS: In this substudy, volunteers aged 18-55 years who were enrolled in the 
phase 1/2 (COV001) controlled trial in the UK and had received either a single 
dose or two doses of 5 × 1010 viral particles were invited back for vaccination. 
Here we report the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a delayed second dose 
(44-45 weeks after first dose) or a third dose of the vaccine (28-38 weeks after 
second dose). Data from volunteers aged 18-55 years who were enrolled in either 
the phase 1/2 (COV001) or phase 2/3 (COV002), single-blinded, randomised 
controlled trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and who had previously received a single 
dose or two doses of 5 × 1010 viral particles are used for comparison purposes. 
COV001 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606, and ISRCTN, 15281137, 
and COV002 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 
15281137, and both are continuing but not recruiting.
FINDINGS: Between March 11 and 21, 2021, 90 participants were enrolled in the 
third-dose boost substudy, of whom 80 (89%) were assessable for reactogenicity, 
75 (83%) were assessable for evaluation of antibodies, and 15 (17%) were 
assessable for T-cells responses. The two-dose cohort comprised 321 participants 
who had reactogenicity data (with prime-boost interval of 8-12 weeks: 267 [83%] 
of 321; 15-25 weeks: 24 [7%]; or 44-45 weeks: 30 [9%]) and 261 who had 
immunogenicity data (interval of 8-12 weeks: 115 [44%] of 261; 15-25 weeks: 116 
[44%]; and 44-45 weeks: 30 [11%]). 480 participants from the single-dose cohort 
were assessable for immunogenicity up to 44-45 weeks after vaccination. Antibody 
titres after a single dose measured approximately 320 days after vaccination 
remained higher than the titres measured at baseline (geometric mean titre of 
66·00 ELISA units [EUs; 95% CI 47·83-91·08] vs 1·75 EUs [1·60-1·93]). 32 
participants received a late second dose of vaccine 44-45 weeks after the first 
dose, of whom 30 were included in immunogenicity and reactogenicity analyses. 
Antibody titres were higher 28 days after vaccination in those with a longer 
interval between first and second dose than for those with a short interval 
(median total IgG titre: 923 EUs [IQR 525-1764] with an 8-12 week interval; 1860 
EUs [917-4934] with a 15-25 week interval; and 3738 EUs [1824-6625] with a 44-45 
week interval). Among participants who received a third dose of vaccine, 
antibody titres (measured in 73 [81%] participants for whom samples were 
available) were significantly higher 28 days after a third dose (median total 
IgG titre: 3746 EUs [IQR 2047-6420]) than 28 days after a second dose (median 
1792 EUs [IQR 899-4634]; Wilcoxon signed rank test p=0·0043). T-cell responses 
were also boosted after a third dose (median response increased from 200 spot 
forming units [SFUs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs; IQR 
127-389] immediately before the third dose to 399 SFUs per milion PBMCs 
[314-662] by day 28 after the third dose; Wilcoxon signed rank test p=0·012). 
Reactogenicity after a late second dose or a third dose was lower than 
reactogenicity after a first dose.
INTERPRETATION: An extended interval before the second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 
leads to increased antibody titres. A third dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induces 
antibodies to a level that correlates with high efficacy after second dose and 
boosts T-cell responses.
