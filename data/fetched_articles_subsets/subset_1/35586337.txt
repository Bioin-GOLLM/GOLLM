Hematuria is a typical symptom of bladder cancer which enables early detection 
of bladder cancer. However, reliable diagnostic tools for bladder cancer using 
urine samples or other non-invasive methods are lacking. Tremendous attempts 
have been tried and revealed fancy works to convey definitive diagnostic power 
using urine samples. In this paper, we reviewed urinary markers for bladder 
cancer and compared their efficacies.
