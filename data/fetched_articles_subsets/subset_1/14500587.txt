BACKGROUND: Because of genetic polymorphisms, cytochrome P450 2D6 (Cyp2D6) 
activity in humans varies widely and alters the metabolism of commonly used 
drugs such as antidepressants, neuroleptics, and cardioactive agents. Severe 
adverse effects or resistance to therapy may result.
METHODS: We performed long PCR on the LightCycler(TM) and used the product as a 
template for a previously validated multiplex PCR that examines the *3, *4, *6, 
*7, and *8 alleles of Cyp2D6. We used real-time PCR to identify the *5 null 
allele and duplication of Cyp2D6 with detection by either hybridization probes 
or SYBR Green((R)). The *2 -1584 C/G polymorphism and the *35 allele were 
identified by PCR with detection by hybridization probes. Products of all PCRs 
were visualized with gel electrophoresis using a 0.7-1.5% agarose gel and 
ethidium bromide. Samples containing the *35 allele were analyzed in parallel by 
digestion with NlaIII, MslI, and BstXI and SmaI. We analyzed samples from 
volunteers and patients (105 samples for deletion and duplication and 116 
samples for preamplification). Of those samples, 59 were from depressive 
inpatients taking part in a trial not yet published.
RESULTS: Identical genotyping results for both real-time and conventional PCR 
were obtained and verified by gel electrophoresis. Use of long-PCR methods on 
the LightCycler enabled comprehensive analysis of all relevant polymorphisms of 
the Cyp2D6 gene in 1 working day with a hands-on time of approximately 3-4 h.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of a successful long-PCR application 
on the LightCycler and the fastest technique for amplification and specific 
detection of a PCR product of comparable length. The method appears suitable for 
large clinical and epidemiologic studies.
