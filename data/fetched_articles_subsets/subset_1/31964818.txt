Plants use leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) to sense sequence 
diverse peptide hormones at the cell surface. A 3.0-Å crystal structure of the 
LRR-RK GSO1/SGN3 regulating Casparian strip formation in the endodermis reveals 
a large spiral-shaped ectodomain. The domain provides a binding platform for 21 
amino acid CIF peptide ligands, which are tyrosine sulfated by the 
tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase TPST/SGN2. GSO1/SGN3 harbors a binding pocket 
for sulfotyrosine and makes extended backbone interactions with CIF2. 
Quantitative biochemical comparisons reveal that GSO1/SGN3-CIF2 represents one 
of the strongest receptor-ligand pairs known in plants. Multiple missense 
mutations are required to block CIF2 binding in vitro and GSO1/SGN3 function in 
vivo. Using structure-guided sequence analysis we uncover previously 
uncharacterized CIF peptides conserved among higher plants. Quantitative binding 
assays with known and novel CIFs suggest that the homologous LRR-RKs GSO1/SGN3 
and GSO2 have evolved unique peptide binding properties to control different 
developmental processes. A quantitative biochemical interaction screen, a CIF 
peptide antagonist and genetic analyses together implicate SERK proteins as 
essential coreceptor kinases required for GSO1/SGN3 and GSO2 receptor 
activation. Our work provides a mechanistic framework for the recognition of 
sequence-divergent peptide hormones in plants.
