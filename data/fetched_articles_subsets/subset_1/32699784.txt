BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver transplantation has become an effective therapy for 
patients with end-stage liver disease. The risk of new-onset diabetes after 
transplantation (NODAT) and posttransplant metabolic syndrome (PTMS) is high 
among patients after liver transplantation. These are thought to be associated 
with increased risks of graft rejection, infection, cardiovascular disease, and 
death. Our study aimed to document the incidence of NODAT and PTMS and analyze 
pre and posttransplant predictive factors for their development in patients 
undergoing a liver transplant.
METHODS: This was a prospective comparative study on 51 patients who underwent 
live donor liver transplantation. They were evaluated at baseline, 3 and 6 
months after transplantation with fasting glucose, lipids, serum insulin levels, 
C-peptide, and HbA1C. They were followed up at 5 years to document any 
cardiovascular events or rejection.
RESULTS: The incidence of preoperative diabetes mellitus (DM) in the study group 
was 25/51 (49%). The incidence of NODAT was 38.5% (10/26 patients) and PTMS 29% 
(10/35), respectively. Age (47.7 ± 5.4 vs 41.5 ± 12.7 years), HOMA2 - IR (2.3 ± 
1.8 vs 2.1 ± 1.6), serum insulin (16.1 ± 12.0 vs 17.9 ± 14.5), and C-peptide 
(4.6 ± 0.5 vs 4.8 ± 0.7) were similar at baseline in the NODAT group compared to 
those who did not develop it. Mean tacrolimus levels were higher in PTMS group 
(6.8 ± 2.9 vs 5.0. ± 2.0 P value = 0.042). By the end of 5 years, 7 patients 
expired; 6 due to rejection and one due to cardiovascular disease. Moreover, 2 
of these patients had preexisting DM and 2 had NODAT.
CONCLUSIONS: None of the baseline metabolic factors in patients undergoing liver 
transplant were predictive of the development of NODAT or PTMS. Mean tacrolimus 
levels were significantly higher in the PTMS group. A 5-year follow-up showed no 
excess risk of cardiovascular events or rejection in those with preexisting DM 
or in those who developed NODAT.
