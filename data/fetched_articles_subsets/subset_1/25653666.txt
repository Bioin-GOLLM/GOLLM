Humans differentiate, classify, and discriminate: social interaction is a basic 
property of human Darwinian evolution. Presumably inherent differential physical 
as well as behavioral properties have always been criteria for identifying 
friend or foe. Yet, biological determinism is a relatively modern term, and 
scientific racism is, oddly enough, largely a consequence or a product of the 
Age of Enlightenment and the establishment of the notion of human equality. In 
recent decades ever-increasing efforts and ingenuity were invested in 
identifying Biblical Israelite genotypic common denominators by analysing an 
assortment of phenotypes, like facial patterns, blood types, diseases, 
DNA-sequences, and more. It becomes overwhelmingly clear that although Jews 
maintained detectable vertical genetic continuity along generations of 
socio-religious-cultural relationship, also intensive horizontal genetic 
relations were maintained both between Jewish communities and with the gentile 
surrounding. Thus, in spite of considerable consanguinity, there is no Jewish 
genotype to identify.
