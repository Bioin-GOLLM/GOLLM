Four boys with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, an X-linked leukodystrophy, 
underwent transplantation with human allogeneic central nervous system stem 
cells (HuCNS-SC). Subsequently, all subjects were followed for an additional 4 
years in this separate follow-up study to evaluate safety, neurologic function, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and immunologic response. The 
neurosurgical procedure, immunosuppression, and HuCNS-SC transplantation were 
well tolerated and all four subjects were alive at the conclusion of the study 
period. At year 2, all subjects exhibited diffusion MRI changes at the 
implantation sites as well as in more distant brain regions. There were 
persistent, increased signal changes in the three patients who were studied up 
to year 5. Two of four subjects developed donor-specific HLA alloantibodies, 
demonstrating that neural stem cells can elicit an immune response when injected 
into the CNS, and suggesting the importance of monitoring immunologic parameters 
and identifying markers of engraftment in future studies.
