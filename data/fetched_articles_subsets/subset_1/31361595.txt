NogoA inhibits neurite outgrowth of motoneurons (NOM) through interaction with 
its receptors, Nogo66/NgR. Inhibition of Nogo receptors rescues NOM, but not to 
the extent exhibited by NogoA-knockout mice, suggesting the presence of other 
pathways. We found that NogoA-overexpressing muscle cells reduced 
phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk1) secretion, resulting in inhibiting NOM. Apart 
from its glycolytic role and independent of the Nogo66 pathway, extracellular 
Pgk1 stimulated NOM by triggering a reduction of p-Cofilin-S3, a growth cone 
collapse marker, through decreasing a novel 
Rac1-GTP/p-Pak1-T423/p-P38-T180/p-MK2-T334/p-Limk1-S323/p-Cofilin-S3 molecular 
pathway. Not only did supplementary Pgk1 enhance NOM in defective cells, but 
injection of Pgk1 rescued denervation in muscle-specific NogoA-overexpression of 
zebrafish and an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis mouse model, SOD1 G93A. Thus, 
Pgk1 secreted from muscle is detrimental to motoneuron neurite outgrowth and 
maintenance.
