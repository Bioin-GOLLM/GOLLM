The treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been revolutionized by the 
small molecule selective kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Imanitib was the 
first BCR-ABL targeted agent approved for the treatment of CML patients and 
confers significant response in most patients; however, a substantial number of 
patients are initially refractory to the drug or may develop resistance during 
the course of treatment. Point mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of BCR-ABL 
that impact drug binding have been identified as one of the major mechanisms of 
resistance. We present here an overview of the current practice in monitoring 
for such mutations, including the methods used, criteria for investigating and 
guidelines for reporting the mutations. We further present and discuss the 
experience of our own laboratory in studying the KD mutations in Indian CML 
patients on imatinib treatment.
