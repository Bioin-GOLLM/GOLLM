OBJECTIVES: The contact system consists of coagulation factor XII (FXII), 
prekallikrein, and H-kininogen (HK) and plays important roles in many diseases. 
Plasma kallikrein (PKa) cleaved HK (cHK) is a marker of contact activation. 
Presently, we developed a specific and precise enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) for determination of cHK in vitro and ex vivo.
METHODS: Cleaved HK specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated 
using a peptide corresponding to the PKa cleavage site on HK as immunogen. 
ELISA, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and immunoprecipitation established 
the specificity of the antibody, which subsequently was used in a sandwich 
ELISA. The analytical imprecision and the concentration of cHK in a reference 
population and in women receiving oral contraceptives (OC) were determined. cHK 
was assessed in vitro in plasma exposed to polytetrafluoroethylene, silicone, 
and glass tubes.
RESULTS: The selected mAb showed excellent specificity towards cHK. The 
intra-assay and inter-assay CV of the ELISA were 3.6 and 6.0%, respectively. The 
reference population (60 women, 60 men) displayed a median cHK plasma 
concentration of 1.38 μg/mL and a reference interval of 0.82 - 2.56 μg/mL. Women 
receiving OC had significantly higher concentrations, p < 0.001. cHK was 
significantly elevated in plasma exposed to polytetrafluoroethylene, p = 0.001, 
and glass, p < 0.0001.
CONCLUSION: The ELISA showed excellent precision and specificity. cHK assessment 
ex vivo demonstrated ongoing contact activation in healthy individuals, 
augmented by OC. The cHK antibody and the ELISA could be promising tools in 
contact activation related diseases and in vitro investigations of the plasma 
compatibility of blood contacting biomaterials.
