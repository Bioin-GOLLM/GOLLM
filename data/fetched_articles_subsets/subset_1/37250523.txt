BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Prolapsed intervertebral disc (IVDP) is a major cause of 
low back pain. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has emerged as a viable option for 
these patients, with fewer adverse effects and long-term sustainability of pain 
relief. This double-blinded, randomised study aimed to evaluate the effect of 
autologous PRP on low back pain in patients with IVDP.
METHODS: A total of 42 patients with IVDP were randomised either to the 
autologous PRP (n = 21) group or control (epidural local anaesthetics with 
steroids; n = 21) group. Change in pain was assessed using the Numeric Rating 
Scale (NRS). Impact of treatment was assessed using the Global Perceived Effect 
(GPE) scale. All the patients were followed up for six months. Data was compared 
using Chi-square, independent sample t, and Mann-Whitney U tests.
RESULTS: The two groups were similar in their demographic and clinical profile. 
The baseline mean NRS ± standard deviation (SD) was 6.91 ± 0.94 in the PRP group 
and 7.38 ± 1.16 in the control group (P = 0.099). At six months, the mean NRS ± 
SD was 1.43 ± 0.75 in the PRP group compared to 5.43 ± 0.75 in the control group 
(P < 0.001). The GPE score was also found to be significantly higher in the PRP 
group, compared to the control group in the final assessment (P < 0.001). During 
the course of the study, the PRP group showed a consistent decline in NRS, 
whereas the control group showed an initial decline followed by consistent 
increase in NRS.
CONCLUSION: PRP provided sustained relief from low back pain due to IVDP and can 
be recommended as a safe and promising alternative to epidural local 
anaesthetics and steroids.
