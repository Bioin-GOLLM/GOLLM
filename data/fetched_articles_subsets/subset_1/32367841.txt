AIM: Data about polymorphism in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and its 
serum levels in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are conflicting. We 
aimed to evaluate the association of TNF-α-308 G > A polymorphism in patients 
with COPD in Kashmir (North India), a high burden area and also determined the 
serum TNF-α levels in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred spirometrically confirmed COPD patients and 
163 controls resident from Kashmir valley (North India) were recruited. 
Genotyping of the promoter region of TNF-α was carried out using polymerase 
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The serum TNF-α was 
quantified using the Cytometric Bead Array flex system by flow cytometry. 
Results were subjected to appropriate statistical treatment andP < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Ninety-one COPD patients (91%) had G/G (wild homozygous) genotype and 
nine patients (9%) had G/A (heterozygous) genotype. Among the control 
population, 150 (92%) had G/G genotype and 13 (8%) had G/A genotype. The variant 
allele "A" was not detected in either of the two groups. Serum levels of TNF-α 
were significantly higher in patients compared to control group (8.0 ± 10.1 
pg/ml vs. 3.3 ± 0.42 pg/ml, respectively,P = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: While serum levels of TNF-α are higher in COPD patients compared to 
the controls, there was no difference in the prevalence of TNF-α-308 
polymorphism in the ethnic Kashmiri population with COPD.
