BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a pleiotropic cytokine 
that has diverse roles in cancer. Rate of production of the major isoform, 
TGF-beta1, is linked with rs1982073 single nucleotide polymorphism in TGFB1 gene 
signal sequence.
METHODS: Peripheral blood DNA of 175 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
patients were genotyped using real-time PCR and fluorescent probes. The median 
follow-up time was 2.9 years (range, 0.1-15.9 years). Survival was assessed 
using Cox regression.
RESULTS: Among the 38 patients who had received chemoradiotherapy without 
surgical resection the high-producer TGFB1 genotypes CC and CT were associated 
with a better disease-free and overall survival when compared with the 
low-producer TT genotype (hazard ratios for interaction 3.42, 95% CI 1.12-10.5 
and 3.09, 95% CI 0.96-10.0, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphism of the TGFB1 signal sequence is associated with 
the response to chemoradiotherapy. TGF-beta1 may sensitize cancer stem cells to 
chemoradiotherapy.
