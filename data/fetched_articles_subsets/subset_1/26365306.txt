Mitochondria are involved in key cellular functions including energy production, 
metabolic homeostasis, and apoptosis. Normal mitochondrial function is preserved 
by several interrelated mechanisms. One mechanism - intramitochondrial quality 
control (IMQC) - is represented by conserved proteases distributed across 
mitochondrial compartments. Many aspects and physiological roles of IMQC 
components remain unclear. Here, we show that the IMQC protease Oma1 is required 
for the stability of the respiratory supercomplexes and thus balanced and 
tunable bioenergetic function. Loss of Oma1 activity leads to a specific 
destabilization of respiratory supercomplexes and consequently to unbalanced 
respiration and progressive respiratory decline in yeast. Similarly, experiments 
in cultured Oma1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts link together impeded 
supercomplex stability and inability to maintain proper respiration under 
conditions that require maximal bioenergetic output. Finally, transient 
knockdown of OMA1 in zebrafish leads to impeded bioenergetics and morphological 
defects of the heart and eyes. Together, our biochemical and genetic studies in 
yeast, zebrafish and mammalian cells identify a novel and conserved 
physiological role for Oma1 protease in fine-tuning of respiratory function. We 
suggest that this unexpected physiological role is important for cellular 
bioenergetic plasticity and may contribute to Oma1-associated disease phenotypes 
in humans.
