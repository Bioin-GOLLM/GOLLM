Heterobifunctional small-molecule degraders that induce protein degradation 
through ligase-mediated ubiquitination have shown considerable promise as a new 
pharmacological modality. However, we currently lack a detailed understanding of 
the molecular basis for target recruitment and selectivity, which is critically 
required to enable rational design of degraders. Here we utilize a comprehensive 
characterization of the ligand-dependent CRBN-BRD4 interaction to demonstrate 
that binding between proteins that have not evolved to interact is plastic. 
Multiple X-ray crystal structures show that plasticity results in several 
distinct low-energy binding conformations that are selectively bound by ligands. 
We demonstrate that computational protein-protein docking can reveal the 
underlying interprotein contacts and inform the design of a BRD4 selective 
degrader that can discriminate between highly homologous BET bromodomains. Our 
findings that plastic interprotein contacts confer selectivity for 
ligand-induced protein dimerization provide a conceptual framework for the 
development of heterobifunctional ligands.
