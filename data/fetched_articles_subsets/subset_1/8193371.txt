We report a new mutation responsible for nonhemolytic hereditary elliptocytosis 
(HE). The proband displayed an impaired spectrin self-association and an 
increase of the alpha I 74-kD fragment (alpha I/74 abnormality). The responsible 
mutation occurred in exon 2 of spectrin alpha-gene: alpha 34 Arg-->Trp 
(CGG-->TGG), defining spectrin Genova. In Trans to allele alpha Genova, the 
proband disclosed allele alpha LELY, a common low-expression allele of spectrin 
alpha-gene. It was recognized through particular peptide maps as well as 
characteristic mutations in exon 40 and intron 45, respectively. The father, who 
carried allele alpha Genova, but not allele alpha LELY, had a milder 
presentation. The sensitization of allele alpha Genova by allele alpha LELY was 
noticeable in the proband as compared with his father. Nevertheless, it was not 
as sharp as that observed with many other alpha I/74 HE alleles. Therefore, each 
alpha I/74 HE allele has a distinct intrinsic severity.
