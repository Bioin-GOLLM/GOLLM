Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the most common form of cardiomyopathy, often 
leads to heart failure and sudden death. While a substantial proportion of DCMs 
are inherited, mutations responsible for the majority of DCMs remain 
unidentified. A genome-wide linkage study was performed to identify the locus 
responsible for an autosomal recessive inherited form of juvenile DCM (JDCM) in 
Portuguese water dogs using 16 families segregating the disease. Results link 
the JDCM locus to canine chromosome 8 with two-point and multipoint lod scores 
of 10.8 and 14, respectively. The locus maps to a 3.9-Mb region, with complete 
syntenic homology to human chromosome 14, that contains no genes or loci known 
to be involved in the development of any type of cardiomyopathy. This discovery 
of a DCM locus with a previously unknown etiology will provide a new gene to 
examine in human DCM patients and a model for testing therapeutic approaches for 
heart failure.
