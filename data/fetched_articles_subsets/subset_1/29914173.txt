MicroRNAs have recently been proposed as non-invasive biomarkers in Oral 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). The aim of this study was to analyze the 
expression of a panel of miRNAs in epithelial cells collected by oral brushing 
from OSCCs from regenerative areas after OSCC surgical resection and from their 
respective normal distant mucosa. Oral brushing specimens were collected from 24 
healthy donors, 14 OSCC patients with specimens from tumour and normal distant 
mucosa, and from 13 patients who had OSCC resection, with samples from 
regenerative areas after OSCC resection and normal distant mucosa. Expression 
levels of eight targets (miR-21, miR-375, miR-345, miR-181b, miR-146a, miR-649, 
miR-518b, and miR-191) were evaluated by real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction 
(PCR). A highly significant between-group difference was found for miR-21 (F = 
6.58, p < 0.001), miR-146a (F = 6.974, p < 0.001), and miR-191 (F = 17.07, p < 
0.001). The major difference was observed between samples from healthy donors 
and from OSCC brushing, whereas no significant differences were observed between 
areas infiltrated by OSCC and their respective normal distant mucosa. 
Furthermore, altered expression of miR-146a and miR-191 was also observed in 
regenerative areas after OSCC resection.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral brushing could be proposed as a noninvasive method to study 
microRNA expression in oral mucosa in OSCC patients.
