BACKGROUND: Actual European pathological classification of early-stage 
endometrial cancer (EC) may show insufficient accuracy to precisely stratify 
recurrence risk, leading to potential over or under treatment. Micro-RNAs are 
post-transcriptional regulators involved in carcinogenic mechanisms, with some 
micro-RNA patterns of expression associated with EC characteristics and 
prognosis. We previously demonstrated that downregulation of micro-RNA-184 was 
associated with lymph node involvement in low-risk EC (LREC). The aim of this 
study was to evaluate whether micro-RNA signature in tumor tissues from LREC 
women can be correlated with the occurrence of recurrences.
METHODS: MicroRNA expression was assessed by chip analysis and qRT-PCR in 7 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) LREC primary tumors from women whose 
follow up showed recurrences (R+) and in 14 FFPE LREC primary tumors from women 
whose follow up did not show any recurrence (R-), matched for grade and age. 
Various statistical analyses, including enrichment analysis and a minimum 
p-value approach, were performed.
RESULTS: The expression levels of micro-RNAs-184, -497-5p, and -196b-3p were 
significantly lower in R+ compared to R- women. Women with a micro-RNA-184 fold 
change < 0.083 were more likely to show recurrence (n = 6; 66%) compared to 
those with a micro-RNA-184 fold change > 0.083 (n = 1; 8%), p = 0.016. Women 
with a micro-RNA-196 fold change < 0.56 were more likely to show recurrence 
(n = 5; 100%) compared to those with a micro-RNA-196 fold change > 0.56 (n = 2; 
13%), p = 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the great interest of micro-RNA-184 as a 
prognostic tool to improve the management of LREC women.
