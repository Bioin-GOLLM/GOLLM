Because cells are constantly exposed to micro-environmental changes, they 
require the ability to adapt to maintain a dynamic equilibrium. Proteins are 
considered critical for the regulation of gene expression, which is a 
fundamental process in determining the cellular responses to stimuli. Recently, 
revolutionary findings in RNA research and the advent of high-throughput genomic 
technologies have revealed a pervasive transcription of the human genome, which 
generates many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) whose roles are largely undefined. 
However, there is evidence that lncRNAs are involved in several cellular 
physiological processes such as adaptation to stresses, cell differentiation, 
maintenance of pluripotency and apoptosis. The correct balance of lncRNA levels 
is crucial for the maintenance of cellular equilibrium, and the dysregulation of 
lncRNA expression is linked to many disorders; certain transcripts are useful 
prognostic markers for some of these pathologies. This review revisits the 
classic concept of cellular homeostasis from the perspective of lncRNAs 
specifically to understand how this novel class of molecules contributes to 
cellular balance and how its dysregulated expression can lead to the onset of 
pathologies such as cancer.
