OBJECTIVE: To evaluate drug utilization pattern in terms of defined daily dose 
along with pharmacoeconomic analysis in geriatric patients admitted in medical 
ward of a tertiary care hospital.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective medical record analysis was performed for 
indoor cases of the geriatric patients (age ≥65 years) admitted in medicine ward 
from January 2010 to December 2010 were analyzed for demographics, indications 
for admission, various systems involved, duration of hospital stay, various 
drugs prescribed, and adverse drug reaction. The drugs were categorized by 
anatomical therapeutic classification and defined daily dose was calculated. The 
World Health Organization prescribing indicators were assessed. Cost of the 
drugs was calculated to assess the economic burden.
RESULTS: Cardiovascular diseases were the common cause for admission. 
Antiplatelet drugs-B01AC (93%), H2 blockers-A02BA (77.22%), antiemetics-A03FA 
(67.6%), vasodilators-C01D (55%), and hypolipidemic drugs-C10AA (52%) were 
commonly utilized groups. Average number of drugs per patient was 9.37 (95% CI: 
9.09-9.64). Average number of antimicrobials prescribed per patient was 0.91 
(95% CI: 0.82-0.99). Cefotaxime was the commonly prescribed antimicrobial drug. 
Average cost of treatment was ₹540.5 (95% CI: ₹458.0-623.0). Patients shared 45% 
of the economic burden for prescribed medicines. The average economic burden for 
drugs was significantly higher in expired than survived patients (₹749.49 vs. 
457.59).
CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy and irrational use of medicines are common problems in 
geriatric prescription. Prescription guidelines should be formatted for them.
