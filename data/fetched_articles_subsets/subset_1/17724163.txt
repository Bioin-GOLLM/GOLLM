Phosducin regulates the expression of transducin betagamma subunits in rod 
photoreceptors and does not contribute to phototransduction adaptation.

For over a decade, phosducin's interaction with the betagamma subunits of the G 
protein, transducin, has been thought to contribute to light adaptation by 
dynamically controlling the amount of transducin heterotrimer available for 
activation by photoexcited rhodopsin. In this study we directly tested this 
hypothesis by characterizing the dark- and light-adapted response properties of 
phosducin knockout (Pd- / -) rods. Pd- / - rods were notably less sensitive to 
light than wild-type (WT) rods. The gain of transduction, as measured by the 
amplification constant using the Lamb-Pugh model of activation, was 32% lower in 
Pd- / - rods than in WT rods. This reduced amplification correlated with a 36% 
reduction in the level of transducin betagamma-subunit expression, and thus 
available heterotrimer in Pd- / - rods. However, commonly studied forms of light 
adaptation were normal in the absence of phosducin. Thus, phosducin does not 
appear to contribute to adaptation mechanisms of the outer segment by 
dynamically controlling heterotrimer availability, but rather is necessary for 
maintaining normal transducin expression and therefore normal flash sensitivity 
in rods.
