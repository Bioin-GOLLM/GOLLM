BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of citrulline on 
the pyroptosis of mouse macrophage RAW264.7 and the mechanism. We investigated 
the effect of citrulline on pyroptosis of RAW264.7 cell induced by 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the modulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) 
signaling.
METHODS: Pyroptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry and caspase-1/sytox 
double staining. Cell counting kit-8 assay was performed to evaluate cell 
viability.
RESULTS: Citrulline promoted cell viability and inhibited the pyroptosis of 
RAW264.7 cell stimulated by LPS. Furthermore, citrulline inactivated NF-κb/p65 
signaling pathway by suppressing p65 nuclear translocation induced by LPS. An 
NF-κb signaling pathway activator, betulinic acid, reversed the inhibition of 
pyroptosis induced by citrulline.
CONCLUSION: Citrulline inhibited LPS-induced pyrophosis, which may be closely 
related to the inactivation of NF-κB/p65 signaling pathway.
