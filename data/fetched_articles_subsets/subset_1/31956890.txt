The human Microprocessor complex cleaves primary microRNA (miRNA) transcripts 
(pri-miRNAs) to initiate miRNA synthesis. Microprocessor consists of DROSHA (an 
RNase III enzyme), and DGCR8. DROSHA contains two RNase III domains, RIIIDa and 
RIIIDb, which simultaneously cleave the 3p- and 5p-strands of pri-miRNAs, 
respectively. In this study, we show that the internal loop located in the lower 
stem of numerous pri-miRNAs selectively inhibits the cleavage of Microprocessor 
on their 3p-strand, thereby, facilitating the single cleavage on their 
5p-strand. This single cleavage does not lead to the production of miRNA but 
instead, it downregulates miRNA expression. We also demonstrate that by 
manipulating the size of the internal loop in the lower stem of pri-miRNAs, we 
can alter the ratio of single-cut to double-cut products resulted from the 
catalysis of Microprocessor, thus changing miRNA production in the in vitro 
pri-miRNA processing assays and in human cells. Therefore, the oscillating level 
of the single cleavage suggests another way of regulation of miRNA expression 
and offers an alternative approach to miRNA knockdown.
