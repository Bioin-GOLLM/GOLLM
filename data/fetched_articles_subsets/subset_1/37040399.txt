A previously reported autoreactive antigen, termed the X-idiotype, isolated from 
a unique cell population in Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients, was found to 
stimulate their CD4+ T cells. This antigen was previously determined to bind 
more favorably than insulin and its mimic (insulin superagonist) to HLA-DQ8, 
supporting its strong role in CD4+ T cell activation. In this work, we probed 
HLA-X-idiotype-TCR binding and designed enhanced-reactive pHLA-TCR antigens 
using an in silico mutagenesis approach which we functionally validated by cell 
proliferation assays and flow cytometry. From a combination of single, double, 
and swap mutations, we identified antigen-binding sites p4 and p6 as potential 
mutation sites for HLA binding affinity enhancement. Site p6 is revealed to 
favor smaller but more hydrophobic residues than the native tyrosine, such as 
valine (Y6V) and isoleucine (Y6I), indicating a steric mechanism in binding 
affinity improvement. Meanwhile, site p4 methionine mutation to hydrophobic 
residues isoleucine (M4I) or leucine (M4L) modestly increases HLA binding 
affinity. Select p6 mutations to cysteine (Y6C) or isoleucine (Y6I) exhibit 
favorable TCR binding affinities, while a swap p5-p6 tyrosine-valine double 
mutant (V5Y_Y6V) and a p6-p7 glutamine-glutamine double mutant (Y6Q_Y7Q) exhibit 
enhanced HLA binding affinity but weakened TCR affinity. This work holds 
relevance to potential T1D antigen-based vaccine design and optimization.
