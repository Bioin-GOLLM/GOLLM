Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignant 
tumors with a poor prognosis. Type X collagen α 1 chain (COL10A1), a member of 
the collagen family, is a gene associated with the progression of a variety of 
human tumors, but the specific function and molecular mechanism of COL10A1 in 
pancreatic cancer remain unclear. Our study found that COL10A1 is highly 
expressed in pancreatic cancer cells and tissues, and its high expression is 
related to poor prognosis and some clinicopathological features, such as tumor 
size and differentiation. Biological functional experiments showed that 
overexpression of COL10A1 enhanced the proliferation and migration of PDAC 
cells. Interestingly, discoid protein domain receptor 2 (DDR2), the receptor of 
COL10A1, is regulated by COL10A1. We found that the COL10A1-DDR2 axis activates 
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
(ERK) pathway, which leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and 
accelerates the progression of pancreatic cancer. In summary, COL10A1 regulates 
PDAC cell proliferation and MEK/ERK signaling pathways by binding to DDR2 to 
promote migration, invasion and EMT. Our study suggested that COL10A1 might be a 
critical factor in promoting PDAC progression. More research is needed to 
confirm COL10A1 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for PDAC.
