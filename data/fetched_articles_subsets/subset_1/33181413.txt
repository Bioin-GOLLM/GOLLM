OBJECTIVE: There were COVID-19 patients with SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid long-term 
positive. This article aims to understand the relevant factors that affect 
SARS-COV-2 clearance time.
METHODS: The clinical data of 115 COVID-19 patients with SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid 
positive time exceeding 14 days were collected retrospectively, and the 
relationship between clinical characteristics, chest CT scans, blood cells, 
biochemical indicators, and the time of viral nucleic acid turning negative were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: The time from symptom onsets to nucleic acid turning negative was 
(32.5 ± 8.7) days in this group of patients. The time of nucleic acid turning 
negative: no fever group was longer than fever group, diabetes group was longer 
than no comorbidity group, elevated levels of ALT (alanine aminotransferase), or 
GLU (fasting blood glucose) group, decreased levels of ALB (albumin) group or 
HDLC (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) group was longer than it's normal 
group separately (P < 0.05). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that 
ALT [odds ratio (OR): 2.164 (95% CI: 1.276-3.670), P = 0.004], GLU [OR: 2.064 
(95% CI: 1.195-3.566), P = 0.009] and HDLC [OR: 0.527 (95% CI: 0.307-0.907), 
P = 0.021] were independent factors which affected the time of nucleic acid 
turning negative.
CONCLUSIONS: ALT, GLU and HDLC were independent factors that influenced the time 
of nucleic acid turning negative. Although diabetes or hyperglycemia is a known 
risk factor, HDLC is the first to be identified, clinicians should be aware of 
dyslipidemia in covid-19 patients.
