Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialized in energy expenditure, making it a 
potential target for anti-obesity therapies. Following exposure to cold, BAT is 
activated by the sympathetic nervous system with concomitant release of 
catecholamines and activation of β-adrenergic receptors. Because BAT therapies 
based on cold exposure or β-adrenergic agonists are clinically not feasible, 
alternative strategies must be explored. Purinergic co-transmission might be 
involved in sympathetic control of BAT and previous studies reported inhibitory 
effects of the purinergic transmitter adenosine in BAT from hamster or rat. 
However, the role of adenosine in human BAT is unknown. Here we show that 
adenosine activates human and murine brown adipocytes at low nanomolar 
concentrations. Adenosine is released in BAT during stimulation of sympathetic 
nerves as well as from brown adipocytes. The adenosine A2A receptor is the most 
abundant adenosine receptor in human and murine BAT. Pharmacological blockade or 
genetic loss of A2A receptors in mice causes a decrease in BAT-dependent 
thermogenesis, whereas treatment with A2A agonists significantly increases 
energy expenditure. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of A2A receptors or 
injection of lentiviral vectors expressing the A2A receptor into white fat 
induces brown-like cells-so-called beige adipocytes. Importantly, mice fed a 
high-fat diet and treated with an A2A agonist are leaner with improved glucose 
tolerance. Taken together, our results demonstrate that adenosine-A2A signalling 
plays an unexpected physiological role in sympathetic BAT activation and 
protects mice from diet-induced obesity. Those findings reveal new possibilities 
for developing novel obesity therapies.
