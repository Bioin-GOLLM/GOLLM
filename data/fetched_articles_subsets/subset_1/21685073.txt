MOTIVATION: In recent years, numerous genome-wide association studies have been 
conducted to identify genetic makeup that explains phenotypic differences 
observed in human population. Analytical tests on single loci are readily 
available and embedded in common genome analysis software toolset. The search 
for significant epistasis (gene-gene interactions) still poses as a 
computational challenge for modern day computing systems, due to the large 
number of hypotheses that have to be tested.
RESULTS: In this article, we present an approach to epistasis detection by 
exhaustive testing of all possible SNP pairs. The search strategy based on the 
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion can help delineate various forms of 
statistical dependence between the genetic markers and the phenotype. The actual 
implementation of this search is done on the highly parallelized architecture 
available on graphics processing units rendering the completion of the full 
search feasible within a day.
