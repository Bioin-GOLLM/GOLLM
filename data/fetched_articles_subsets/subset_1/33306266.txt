Polo-like kinases (PLKs) are potent regulators of cell proliferation and cell 
survival. Polo-like kinases are potential targets in the treatment of anaplastic 
thyroid cancer (ATC), a rare but deadly disease. The therapeutic effects of 
volasertib, a PLK inhibitor, was evaluated for the treatment of ATC either alone 
or in combination with sorafenib. Volasertib decreased cell viability in three 
ATC cell lines (8505C, 8305C, and KAT18) in a dose-dependent manner. Volasertib 
caused ATC cells to accumulate in G2 /M phase, activated caspase-3 activity, and 
induced apoptosis. Combination therapy using volasertib and sorafenib in ATC 
cells showed mostly synergistic effects. In vivo studies revealed that 
combination therapy of volasertib and sorafenib was effective in the treatment 
of 8505C xenografts. Single-agent volasertib treatment was sufficient to retard 
8305C tumor growth. No substantial morbidity was observed in animals that 
received either single-agent or combination treatment. These preclinical 
findings suggest that volasertib could be an effective drug in treating ATC.
