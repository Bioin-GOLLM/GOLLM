BACKGROUND: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is an autosomal 
dominant disease due to germline mutations of human mismatch repair genes, 
mainly hMLH1 and hMSH2. The aim of the present study was to identify the point 
mutations and large genomic deletions of hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes in 14 Chinese 
HNPCC families.
METHODS: Fourteen families fulfilling the Chinese HNPCC criteria were involved 
in this study. Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples was analyzed. 
Point mutations were detected by denaturing high performance liquid 
chromatography (DHPLC) followed by DNA sequencing. Multiplex polymerase chain 
reaction and GeneScan analysis were employed to detect the large genomic 
deletions of these two genes.
RESULTS: Four of the 14 probands (29%) had sequence abnormalities that probably 
affect the protein function in the exonic regions of hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes. 
Included were one complete deletion of exons 1-7 and one missense mutation of 
the hMSH2 gene, and one nonsense mutation and one missense mutation of the hMLH1 
gene. The large genomic deletion accounted for 25% (one out of four) of all 
mutations. Half (two out of four, 50%) of the mutations were missense mutation. 
In addition, one silent mutation, four polymorphisms in the exonic regions and 
four polymorphisms in the intronic regions were also discovered.
CONCLUSIONS: Point mutations and large genomic deletions of the hMLH1 and hMSH2 
genes were responsible for nearly one-third of Chinese HNPCC families. Detection 
of large genomic deletions should be involved in the routine screening manual 
for HNPCC families.
