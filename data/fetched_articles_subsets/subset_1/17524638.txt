Some of the APC negative FAP and AFAP cases have recently been found to be 
attributable to MYH associated polyposis (MAP). MAP is an autosomal recessive 
syndrome associated with 5-100 colorectal adenomas and caused by mutation in the 
MYH gene. Here, we screened for germline MYH mutations in 82 
APC-mutation-negative probands with classical and attenuated familial 
adenomatous polyposis using the denaturing high performance liquid 
chromatography (DHPLC) method in combination with sequencing. Altogether 12 
previously reported changes and four novel genetic alterations, mostly in 
intronic sequences, were identified. The results revealed the presence of 
biallelic germline MYH mutations in two patients. These patients were compound 
heterozygotes for two of the most common germline mutations c.494 A>G (p.Y165C); 
c.1,145 G>A (p.G382D). These variants are established to be associated with 
adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer. No novel pathogenic mutation has 
been identified in our study.
