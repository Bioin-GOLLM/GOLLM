INTRODUCTION: Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has tremendously 
improved the life expectancy of the HIV-infected population over the past three 
decades. Protease inhibitors have been one of the major classes of drugs in 
HAART regimens that are effective in treating HIV. However, the emergence of 
resistance and cross-resistance against protease inhibitors encourages 
researchers to develop new PIs with broad-spectrum activity, as well as novel 
means of enhancing the efficacy of existing PIs.
AREAS COVERED: In this article we discuss recent advances in HIV protease 
inhibitor (PI) development, focusing on both investigational and experimental 
agents. We also include a section on pharmacokinetic booster drugs for improved 
bioavailability of protease inhibitors. Further, we discuss novel drug delivery 
systems using a variety of nanocarriers for the delivery of PIs across the 
blood-brain barrier to treat the HIV in the brain.
EXPERT OPINION: We discuss our opinion on the promises and challenges on the 
development of novel investigational and experimental PIs that are less toxic 
and more effective in combating drug-resistance. Further, we discuss the future 
of novel nanocarriers that have been developed to deliver PIs to the brain 
cells. Although these are promising findings, many challenges need to be 
overcome prior to making them a viable option.
