RAF kinases are part of a conserved signaling pathway that impacts cell growth, 
differentiation, and survival, and RAF pathway dysregulation is an attractive 
target for therapeutic intervention. We describe two homogeneous fluorescent 
formats that distinguish RAF pathway inhibitors from direct RAF kinase 
inhibitors, using B-RAF, B-RAF V599E, and C-RAF. A FÃ¶rster-resonance energy 
transfer (FRET) based method was used to develop RAF and MEK cascade assays as 
well as a direct ERK kinase assay. This method uses a peptide substrate, that is 
terminally labeled with a FRET-pair of fluorophores, and that is more sensitive 
to proteolysis relative to the phosphorylated peptide. A second time-resolved 
FRET-based assay using fluorescently labeled MEK substrate was used to detect 
direct inhibitors of RAF kinase activity. The cascade assays detect compounds 
that interact with activated and unactivated kinases within the recapitulated 
RAF pathway, and the direct assays isolate the point of action for an inhibitor.
