Cytochrome c can acquire peroxidase activity when it binds to cardiolipin in 
mitochondrial membranes. The resulting oxygenation of cardiolipin by cytochrome 
c provides an early signal for the onset of apoptosis. The structure of this 
enzyme-substrate complex is a matter of considerable debate. We present three 
structures at 1.7-2.0 Å resolution of a domain-swapped dimer of yeast 
iso-1-cytochrome c with the detergents, CYMAL-5, CYMAL-6, and 
ω-undecylenyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, bound in a channel that places the 
hydrocarbon moieties of these detergents next to the heme. The heme is poised 
for peroxidase activity with water bound in place of Met80, which serves as the 
axial heme ligand when cytochrome c functions as an electron carrier. The 
hydroxyl group of Tyr67 sits 3.6-4.0 Å from the nearest carbon of the 
detergents, positioned to act as a relay in radical abstraction during 
peroxidase activity. Docking studies with linoleic acid, the most common fatty 
acid component of cardiolipin, show that C11 of linoleic acid can sit adjacent 
to Tyr67 and the heme, consistent with the oxygenation pattern observed in 
lipidomics studies. The well-defined hydrocarbon binding pocket provides atomic 
resolution evidence for the extended lipid anchorage model for cytochrome 
c/cardiolipin binding. Dimer dissociation/association kinetics for yeast versus 
equine cytochrome c indicate that formation of mammalian cytochrome c dimers in 
vivo would require catalysis. However, the dimer structure shows that only a 
modest deformation of monomeric cytochrome c would suffice to form the 
hydrocarbon binding site occupied by these detergents.
