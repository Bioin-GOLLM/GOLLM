Cancer accounted for 16% of all death worldwide in 2018. Significant progress 
has been made in understanding tumor occurrence, progression, diagnosis, 
treatment, and prognosis at the molecular level. However, genomics changes 
cannot truly reflect the state of protein activity in the body due to the poor 
correlation between genes and proteins. Quantitative proteomics, capable of 
quantifying the relatively different protein abundance in cancer patients, has 
been increasingly adopted in cancer research. Quantitative proteomics has great 
application potentials, including cancer diagnosis, personalized therapeutic 
drug selection, real-time therapeutic effects and toxicity evaluation, prognosis 
and drug resistance evaluation, and new therapeutic target discovery. In this 
review, the development, testing samples, and detection methods of quantitative 
proteomics are introduced. The biomarkers identified by quantitative proteomics 
for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug resistance are reviewed. The 
challenges and prospects of quantitative proteomics for personalized medicine 
are also discussed.
