OBJECTIVES: The emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a point mutation in the 
spike (S) protein, D614G, has taken precedence over the original Wuhan isolate 
by May 2020. With an increased infection and transmission rate, it is imperative 
to determine whether antibodies induced against the D614 isolate may 
cross-neutralise against the G614 variant.
METHODS: Antibody profiling against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein of the D614 variant 
by flow cytometry and assessment of neutralising antibody titres using 
pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein of either the D614 
or G614 variant tagged with a luciferase reporter were performed on plasma 
samples from COVID-19 patients with known D614G status (n = 44 infected with 
D614, n = 6 infected with G614, n = 7 containing all other clades: O, S, L, V, 
G, GH or GR).
RESULTS: Profiling of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity reveals similar 
neutralisation profiles against both S protein variants, albeit waning 
neutralising antibody capacity at the later phase of infection. Of clinical 
importance, patients infected with either the D614 or G614 clade elicited a 
similar degree of neutralisation against both pseudoviruses, suggesting that the 
D614G mutation does not impact the neutralisation capacity of the elicited 
antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Cross-reactivity occurs at the functional level of the humoral 
response on both the S protein variants, which suggests that existing 
serological assays will be able to detect both D614 and G614 clades of 
SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, there should be negligible impact towards the 
efficacy of antibody-based therapies and vaccines that are currently being 
developed.
