In early 2020, one of the most prevalent symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 
the loss of smell (anosmia), found in 60-70% of all cases. Anosmia used to occur 
early, concomitantly with other symptoms, and often persisted after recovery for 
an extended period, sometimes for months. In addition to smell disturbance, 
COVID-19 has also been associated with loss of taste (ageusia). The latest 
research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could spread from the respiratory system to 
the brain through receptors in sustentacular cells localized to the olfactory 
epithelium. The virus invades human cells via the obligatory receptor, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), and a priming protease, TMPRSS2, 
facilitating viral penetration. There is an abundant expression of both ACE2 and 
TMPRSS2 in sustentacular cells. In this study, we evaluated 102 COVID-19 
hospitalized patients, of which 17.60% presented anosmia and 9.80% ageusia. 
ACE1, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 gene expression levels in nasopharyngeal tissue were 
obtained by RT-qPCR and measured using ΔCT analysis. ACE1 Alu287bp association 
was also evaluated. Logistic regression models were generated to estimate the 
effects of variables on ageusia and anosmia Association of ACE2 expression 
levels with ageusia. was observed (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.098-1.775); however, no 
association was observed between TMPRSS2 and ACE1 expression levels and ageusia. 
No association was observed among the three genes and anosmia, and the Alu287bp 
polymorphism was not associated with any of the outcomes. Lastly, we discuss 
whetherthere is a bridge linking these initial symptoms, including molecular 
factors, to long-term COVID-19 health consequences such as cognitive 
dysfunctions.
