PURPOSE: We examined hospital use of the epidermal growth factor receptor assay 
in patients with lung cancer in the United States. Our goal was to inform the 
development of a model to predict phase 3 translation of guideline-directed 
molecular diagnostic tests.
METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. Using logistic 
regression, we analyzed the association between hospitals' institutional and 
regional characteristics and the likelihood that an epidermal growth factor 
receptor assay would be ordered.
RESULTS: Significant institutional predictors included affiliation with an 
academic medical center (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.83), 
participation in a National Cancer Institute clinical research cooperative group 
(odds ratio, 2.06, 1.66-2.55), and -availability of positron emission tomography 
scan (odds ratio, 1.44, 1.07-1.94) and cardiothoracic surgery (odds ratio, 1.90, 
1.52-2.37) services. Significant regional predictors included metropolitan 
county (odds ratio, 2.08, 1.48-2.91), population with above-average education 
(odds ratio, 1.46, 1.09-1.96), and population with above-average income (odds 
ratio, 1.46, 1.04-2.05). Distance from a National Cancer Institute cancer center 
was a negative predictor (odds ratio, 0.996, 0.995-0.998), with a 34% decrease 
in likelihood for every 100 miles.
CONCLUSION: In 2010, only 12% of US acute-care hospitals ordered the epidermal 
growth factor receptor assay, suggesting that most patients with lung cancer did 
not have access to this test. This case study illustrated the need for: (i) 
increased dissemination and implementation research, and (ii) interventions to 
improve adoption of guideline-directed molecular diagnostic tests by community 
hospitals.
