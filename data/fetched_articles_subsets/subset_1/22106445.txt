The World Health Organization estimates that the number of obese and overweight 
adults has increased to 1.6 billion, with concomitant increases in comorbidity. 
While genetic factors for obesity have been extensively studied in Caucasians, 
fewer studies have investigated genetic determinants of body mass index (BMI; 
weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) in African Americans. A total of 38 genes and 1,086 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in African Americans (n = 1,173) and 897 
SNPs in Caucasians (n = 1,165) were examined in the Southern Community Cohort 
Study (2002-2009) for associations with BMI and gene × environment interactions. 
A statistically significant association with BMI survived correction for 
multiple testing at rs4140535 (β = -0.04, 95% confidence interval: -0.06, -0.02; 
P = 5.76 × 10(-5)) in African Americans but not in Caucasians. Gene-environment 
interactions were observed with cigarette smoking and a SNP in ADIPOR1 in 
African Americans, as well as between a different SNP in ADIPOR1 and physical 
activity in Caucasians. A SNP in PPARGC1A interacted with alcohol consumption in 
African Americans, and a different SNP in PPARGC1A was nominally associated in 
Caucasians. A SNP in CYP19A1 interacted with dietary energy intake in African 
Americans, and another SNP in CYP191A had an independent association with BMI in 
Caucasians.
