In humans, mutation of glycine 93 to alanine of Cu++/Zn++ superoxide dismutase 
type-1 (SOD1-G93 A) has been associated to some familial cases of Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Several evidence proposed the involvement of 
environmental pollutants that like mercury could accelerate ALS symptoms. 
SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with SOD1 and G93 A mutant of SOD1 constructs 
were exposed to non-toxic concentrations (0.01 μM) of ethylmercury 
thiosalicylate (thimerosal) for 24 h. Interestingly, we found that thimerosal, 
in SOD1-G93 A cells, but not in SOD1 cells, reduced cell survival. Furthermore, 
thimerosal-induced cell death occurred in a concentration dependent-manner and 
was prevented by the Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activator Resveratrol (RSV). Moreover, 
thimerosal decreased the protein expression of transcription factor Downstream 
Regulatory Element Antagonist Modulator (DREAM), but not DREAM gene. 
Interestingly, DREAM reduction was blocked by co-treatment with RSV, suggesting 
the participation of SIRT1 in determining this effect. Immunoprecipitation 
experiments in SOD1-G93 A cells exposed to thimerosal demonstrated that RSV 
increased DREAM deacetylation and reduced its polyubiquitination. In addition, 
RSV counteracted thimerosal-enhanced prodynorphin (PDYN) mRNA, a DREAM target 
gene. Furthermore, cortical neurons transiently transfected with SOD1-G93 A 
construct and exposed to thimerosal (0.5 μM/24 h) showed a reduction of DREAM 
and an up-regulation of the prodynorphin gene. Importantly, both the treatment 
with RSV or the transfection of siRNA against prodynorphin signiﬁcantly reduced 
thimerosal-induced neurotoxicity, while DREAM knocking-down potentiated 
thimerosal-reduced cell survival. These results demonstrate the particular 
vulnerability of SOD1-G93 A neuronal cells to thimerosal and that RSV via SIRT1 
counteracts the neurodetrimental effect of this toxicant by preventing DREAM 
reduction and prodynorphin up-regulation.
