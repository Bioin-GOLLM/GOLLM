BACKGROUND: Low birth weight (LBW) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and 
mortality, and increases various disease risks across life stages. Prediction 
models of LBW have been developed before, but have limitations including small 
sample sizes, absence of genetic factors and no stratification of neonate into 
preterm and term birth groups. In this study, we challenged the development of 
early prediction models of LBW based on environmental and genetic factors in 
preterm and term birth groups, and clarified influential variables for LBW 
prediction.
METHODS: We selected 22,711 neonates, their 21,581 mothers and 8,593 fathers 
from the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project Birth and Three-Generation cohort 
study. To establish early prediction models of LBW for preterm birth and term 
birth groups, we trained AI-based models using genetic and environmental factors 
of lifestyles. We then clarified influential environmental and genetic factors 
for predicting LBW in the term and preterm groups.
RESULTS: We identified 2,327 (10.22%) LBW neonates consisting of 1,077 preterm 
births and 1,248 term births. Our early prediction models archived the area 
under curve 0.96 and 0.95 for term LBW and preterm LBW models, respectively. We 
revealed that environmental factors regarding eating habits and genetic features 
related to fetal growth were influential for predicting LBW in the term LBW 
model. On the other hand, we identified that genomic features related to 
toll-like receptor regulations and infection reactions are influential genetic 
factors for prediction in the preterm LBW model.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed precise early prediction models of LBW based on 
lifestyle factors in the term birth group and genetic factors in the preterm 
birth group. Because of its accuracy and generalisability, our prediction model 
could contribute to risk assessment of LBW in the early stage of pregnancy and 
control LBW risk in the term birth group. Our prediction model could also 
contribute to precise prediction of LBW based on genetic factors in the preterm 
birth group. We then identified parental genetic and maternal environmental 
factors during pregnancy influencing LBW prediction, which are major targets for 
understanding the LBW to address serious burdens on newborns' health throughout 
life.
