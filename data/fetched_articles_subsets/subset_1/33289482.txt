Metabolic dysfunction underlies several chronic diseases, many of which are 
exacerbated by obesity. Dietary interventions can reverse metabolic declines and 
slow aging, although compliance issues remain paramount. 17α-estradiol treatment 
improves metabolic parameters and slows aging in male mice. The mechanisms by 
which 17α-estradiol elicits these benefits remain unresolved. Herein, we show 
that 17α-estradiol elicits similar genomic binding and transcriptional 
activation through estrogen receptor α (ERα) to that of 17β-estradiol. In 
addition, we show that the ablation of ERα completely attenuates the beneficial 
metabolic effects of 17α-E2 in male mice. Our findings suggest that 17α-E2 may 
act through the liver and hypothalamus to improve metabolic parameters in male 
mice. Lastly, we also determined that 17α-E2 improves metabolic parameters in 
male rats, thereby proving that the beneficial effects of 17α-E2 are not limited 
to mice. Collectively, these studies suggest ERα may be a drug target for 
mitigating chronic diseases in male mammals.
