Impaired autophagy promotes Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Claudin-2 is 
upregulated in IBD however its role in the pathobiology remains uncertain due to 
its complex regulation, including by autophagy. Irrespective, claudin-2 
expression protects mice from DSS colitis. This study was undertaken to examine 
if an interplay between autophagy and claudin-2 protects from colitis and 
associated epithelial injury. Crypt culture and intestinal epithelial cells 
(IECs) are subjected to stress, including starvation or DSS, the chemical that 
induces colitis in-vivo. Autophagy flux, cell survival, co-immunoprecipitation, 
proximity ligation assay, and gene mutational studies are performed. These 
studies reveal that under colitis/stress conditions, claudin-2 undergoes 
polyubiquitination and P62/SQSTM1-assisted degradation through autophagy. 
Inhibiting autophagy-mediated claudin-2 degradation promotes cell death and thus 
suggest that claudin-2 degradation promotes autophagy flux to promote cell 
survival. Overall, these data inform for the previously undescribed role for 
claudin-2 in facilitating IECs survival under stress conditions, which can be 
harnessed for therapeutic advantages.
