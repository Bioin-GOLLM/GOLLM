Dietary intake of foods rich in antioxidant properties is suggested to be cancer 
protective. Foods rich in antioxidant properties include grape (Vitis vinifera), 
one of the world's largest fruit crops and most commonly consumed fruits in the 
world. The composition and cancer-protective effects of major phenolic 
antioxidants in grape skin and seed extracts are discussed in this review. Grape 
skin and seed extracts exert strong free radical scavenging and chelating 
activities and inhibit lipid oxidation in various food and cell models in vitro. 
The use of grape antioxidants are promising against a broad range of cancer 
cells by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream 
pathways, inhibiting over-expression of COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 receptors, or 
modifying estrogen receptor pathways, resulting in cell cycle arrest and 
apoptosis. Interestingly, some of these activities were also demonstrated in 
animal models. However, in vivo studies have demonstrated inconsistent 
antioxidant efficacy. Nonetheless, a growing body of evidence from human 
clinical trials has demonstrated that consumption of grape, wine and grape juice 
exerts many health-promoting and possible anti-cancer effects. Thus, grape skin 
and seed extracts have great potential in cancer prevention and further 
investigation into this exciting field is warranted.
