Purpose: Despite the challenge to directly target mutant KRAS due to its high 
GTP affinity, some agents are under development against downstream signaling 
pathways, such as MEK inhibitors. However, it remains controversial whether MEK 
inhibitors can boost current chemotherapy in KRAS-mutant lung tumors in clinic. 
Considering the genomic heterogeneity among patients with lung cancer, it is 
valuable to test potential therapeutics in KRAS mutation-driven mouse 
models.Experimental Design: We first compared the pERK1/2 level in lung cancer 
samples with different KRAS substitutions and generated a new genetically 
engineered mouse model whose tumor was driven by KRAS G12C, the most common KRAS 
mutation in lung cancer. Next, we evaluated the efficacy of selumetinib or its 
combination with chemotherapy, in KRASG12C tumors compared with KRASG12D tumors. 
Moreover, we generated KRASG12C/p53R270H model to explore the role of a dominant 
negative p53 mutation detected in patients in responsiveness to MEK 
inhibition.Results: We determined higher pERK1/2 in KRASG12C lung tumors 
compared with KRASG12D Using mouse models, we further identified that KRASG12C 
tumors are significantly more sensitive to selumetinib compared with KrasG12D 
tumors. MEK inhibition significantly increased chemotherapeutic efficacy and 
progression-free survival of KRASG12C mice. Interestingly, p53 co-mutation 
rendered KRASG12C lung tumors less sensitive to combination treatment with 
selumetinib and chemotherapy.Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that unique KRAS 
mutations and concurrent mutations in tumor-suppressor genes are important 
factors for lung tumor responses to MEK inhibitor. Our preclinical study 
supports further clinical evaluation of combined MEK inhibition and chemotherapy 
for lung cancer patients harboring KRAS G12C and wild-type p53 status. Clin
