cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) enzymes are immune sensors that 
synthesize nucleotide second messengers and initiate antiviral responses in 
bacterial and animal cells. Here, we discover Enterobacter cloacae 
CD-NTase-associated protein 4 (Cap4) as a founding member of a diverse family of 
>2,000 bacterial receptors that respond to CD-NTase signals. Structures of Cap4 
reveal a promiscuous DNA endonuclease domain activated through ligand-induced 
oligomerization. Oligonucleotide recognition occurs through an appended SAVED 
domain that is an unexpected fusion of two CRISPR-associated Rossman fold (CARF) 
subunits co-opted from type III CRISPR immunity. Like a lock and key, SAVED 
effectors exquisitely discriminate 2'-5'- and 3'-5'-linked bacterial cyclic 
oligonucleotide signals and enable specific recognition of at least 180 
potential nucleotide second messenger species. Our results reveal SAVED CARF 
family proteins as major nucleotide second messenger receptors in CBASS and 
CRISPR immune defense and extend the importance of linkage specificity beyond 
mammalian cGAS-STING signaling.
