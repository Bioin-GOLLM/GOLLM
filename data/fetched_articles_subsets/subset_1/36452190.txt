BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 1000 men have a 47,XYY karyotype. Previous 
publications have presented cases of infertile XYY men and have suggested that 
the additional Y chromosome may cause disrupted meiosis leading to sperm 
apoptosis. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether XYY men are 
over-represented in infertility cohorts.
METHODS: In this paper, an ongoing infertility cohort was evaluated for Y 
chromosome microdeletions using the MLPA technique and the data from the first 
2000 referrals were recorded. Moreover, the MLPA technique detected 47,XYY 
karyotypes.
RESULTS: Four XYY individuals were identified within the cohort. One of the four 
XYY men was shown to have an apparent gr/gr partial AZFc deletion on both Y 
chromosomes while Sertoli cell only syndrome was detected in another case. The 
other two cases (out of 2000) might, therefore, represent an incidental finding.
CONCLUSION: The gr/gr deletion is not detectable by the multiplex PCR method; 
therefore, there might be additional explanations for the fertility problems of 
infertile XYY men reported in previously published articles. It seems that among 
other cases, their XYY karyotype may be coincidental, rather than causative of 
their fertility issues.
