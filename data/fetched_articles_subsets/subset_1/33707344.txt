Elderly patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have a 
higher risk of both ischemic and bleeding complications than younger patients. 
However, few studies have reported how genetic information of elderly patients 
treated with PCI affects clinical outcomes. We investigated the impact of 
genetic variants on clinical outcomes in elderly patients. Correlations between 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (CYP2C19 and P2Y12 receptor gene G52T 
polymorphism) and clinical outcomes were analyzed in 811 elderly patients (≥75 
years of age) from a prospective multicenter registry. The primary endpoint was 
a composite of myocardial infarction and death. Secondary endpoints were an 
individual event of death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stent 
thrombosis, target lesion revascularization, stroke, and major bleeding 
(Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ≥3). Regarding CYP2C19, patients with 
poor metabolizers had a significantly higher risk for the primary endpoint 
(hazard ratio [HR] 2.43; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.12-5.24; p=0.024) 
and secondary endpoints (death and cardiac death). Regarding P2Y12 G52T, the TT 
group had a significantly higher occurrence of major bleeding than the other 
groups (HR 3.87; 95% CI 1.41-10.68; p=0.009). In conclusion, poor metabolizers 
of CYP2C19 and TT groups of P2Y12 G52T may be significant predictors of poor 
clinical outcomes in elderly patients.
