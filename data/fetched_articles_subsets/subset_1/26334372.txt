We report RNA-Seq results from skin of X. maculatus Jp 163 B after exposure to 
various doses of "cool white" fluorescent light (FL). We show that FL exposure 
incites a genetic transcriptional response in skin nearly as great as observed 
for UVB exposure; however, the gene sets modulated due to exposure to the two 
light sources are quite different. Known light responsive genes involved in 
maintaining circadian cycling (e.g., clock, cry2a, cry1b, per1b, per2, per3, and 
arntl1a) exhibited expected shifts in transcriptional expression upon FL 
exposure. Exposure to FL also resulted in down-regulated transcription of many 
genes involved with cell cycle progression (e.g., cdc20, cdc45, cdca7b, plk1, 
cdk1, ccnb-3, and cdca7a) and chromosome segregation (e.g., cenpe, cenpf, cenpi, 
cenpk, cenpo, cenpp, and cenpu; cep70; knstrm, kntc, mcm2, mcm5; smc2). In 
addition, several DNA replication and recombination repair genes (e.g., pola1, 
pole, rec52, rad54l, rpa1, and parpbp) exhibit reduced expression in FL exposed 
X. maculatus skin. Some genes down modulated by FL are known to be associated 
with DNA repair and human diseases (e.g., atm2, brip1, fanc1, fancl, and xrcc4). 
The overall suppression of genes involved with mitotic progression in the skin 
of adult fish is consistent with entry into the light phase of the circadian 
cycle. Current efforts are aimed at determining specific wavelengths that may 
lead to differential expression among the many genes affected by fluorescent 
light exposure.
