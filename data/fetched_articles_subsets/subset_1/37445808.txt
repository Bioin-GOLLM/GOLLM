An in vitro/in vivo hepatotoxicity and hepatoprotection evaluation of a defatted 
extract and a phenolic fraction from Phlomis tuberosa, administered alone and in 
a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced metabolic bioactivation model, was 
performed. The extract and the phenolic fraction were analysed by high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the total flavonoid 
content, to identify flavonoids and to quantify verbascoside. In addition, total 
polyphenolics in the samples were expressed as gallic acid equivalents. Applied 
alone, the extract and the fraction (5, 10 and 50 µg/mL) did not show a 
statistically significant hepatotoxic effect on isolated rat hepatocytes in 
vitro. In a CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity model, the samples exhibited a 
concentration-dependent, statistically significant hepatoprotective effect, 
which was most pronounced at 50 µg/mL for both. The phenolic fraction exhibited 
a more pronounced hepatoprotective effect compared to the extract. Data from the 
in vitro study on the effects of the extract were also confirmed in the in vivo 
experiment conducted in a CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity model in rats. A 
histopathological study showed that the animals treated with CCl4 and the 
extract had an unaltered histoarchitecture of the liver. The effects of the 
extract were the same as those of silymarin.
