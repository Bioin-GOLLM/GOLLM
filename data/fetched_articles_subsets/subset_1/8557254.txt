To contribute to the analysis of the genetic background of atherosclerosis, 
especially endothelial dysfunction, we searched for DNA polymorphisms in the 
genes encoding E-, P-, and L-selectin, and ICAM-I and VCAM-I. We detected 17 
mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphisms analysis and direct 
sequencing. Five of them resulted in an amino acid substitution. In E-selectin, 
exchanges from serine to arginine (position 128), from leucine to phenylalanine 
(position 554), and a DNA mutation from guanine to thymine (position 98) present 
significantly different allele frequencies in young patients with 
angiographically established, severe atherosclerosis, compared with an 
unselected population. Results suggest that these polymorphisms are associated 
with a higher risk for early severe atherosclerosis.
