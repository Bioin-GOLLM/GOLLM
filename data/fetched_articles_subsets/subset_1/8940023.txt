v-H-Ras harboring the Gly-60 to Ala mutation (G60A) lacks the ability to induce 
germinal vesicle breakdown in Xenopus oocytes. Moreover, this mutant is capable 
of inhibiting the activity of v-H-Ras to induce oocyte germinal vesicle 
breakdown when co-injected. The duration and the extent of inhibition depends on 
the molar ratio of v-H-Ras(G60A) to v-H-Ras. The inhibition is not due to a 
general toxicity of v-H-Ras(G60A) to oocytes because oocytes injected with 
v-H-Ras(G60A) can be readily induced to mature by other mitogenic agents, such 
as insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, insulin-like growth factor 2, and 
phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C. The dominant negative effect of 
v-H-Ras(G60A) requires proper membrane attachment of v-H-Ras(G60A). By using a 
competition assay, it was concluded that the dominant negative phenotype of 
v-H-Ras(G60A) resulted from sequestering H-Ras downstream effector(s). Raf-1 was 
identified as one of the sequestered targets.
