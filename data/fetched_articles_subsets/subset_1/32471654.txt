Neurotransmitter transporters (NTTs) are involved in the fine-tuning of brain 
neurotransmitter homeostasis. As such, they are implicated in a plethora of 
complex behaviors, including reward, movement, and cognition. During recent 
decades, compounds that modulate NTT functions have been developed. Some of them 
are in clinical use for the management of different neuropsychiatric conditions. 
The majority of these compounds have been found to selectively interact with the 
orthosteric site of NTTs. Recently, diverse allosteric sites have been described 
in a number of NTTs, modulating their function. A more complex NTT pharmacology 
may be useful in the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we summarize 
current knowledge on such modulatory allosteric sites, with specific focus on 
their pharmacological and therapeutic potential.
