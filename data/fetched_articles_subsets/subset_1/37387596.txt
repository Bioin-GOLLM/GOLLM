OBJECTIVES: Acquired resistance represents a bottleneck to epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment in lung cancer. 
Our study aimed to explore the efficacy of antiangiogenic-based therapy in 
osimertinib-resistant NSCLC patients and assess the efficacy of anlotinib in 
vitro study.
METHODS: Our multicenter study retrospectively collected 268 
osimertinib-resistant NSCLC patients with EGFR T790M mutation and explored the 
efficacy of anlotinib in patients and in vitro.
RESULTS: PFS was significantly longer in the antiangiogenic-based therapy group 
than in the immunotherapy group (HR: 0.71, p = 0.050) and the chemotherapy group 
(HR: 0.28, p = 0.001). Both the ORR and DCR of the antiangiogenic-based group 
were higher than the immunotherapy group and the chemotherapy group. Subgroup 
analysis showed a trend of more benefits from the anlotinib-based therapy than 
the bevacizumab-based therapy in terms of PFS (HR: 0.63, p = 0.087) and OS (HR: 
0.52, p = 0.063). In vitro assays verified that anlotinib alone or combined with 
osimertinib exerted potent cytotoxicity to T790M-mutant H1975 cell line with 
acquired osimertinib resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that antiangiogenic-based therapy might improve 
PFS and OS in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to 
osimertinib. Moreover, anlotinib-based therapy could be a promising effective 
treatment for this group of patients.
