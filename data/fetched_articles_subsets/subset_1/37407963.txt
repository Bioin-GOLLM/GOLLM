BACKGROUND: The detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations 
in patients with non-small cell lung cancer is critical for tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor therapy. EGFR detection requires tissue samples, which are difficult 
to obtain in some patients, costing them the opportunity for further treatment. 
To realize EGFR mutation prediction without molecular detection, we aimed to 
build a high-accuracy deep learning model with only haematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E)-stained slides.
METHODS: We collected 326 H&E-stained non-small cell lung cancer slides from 
Beijing Chest Hospital, China, and used 226 slides (88 with EGFR mutations) for 
model training. The remaining 100 images (50 with EGFR mutations) were used for 
testing. We trained a convolutional neural network based on ResNet-50 to 
classify EGFR mutation status on the slide level.
RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 76% and 74%, 
respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.82. When applying the 
double-threshold approach, 33% of the patients could be predicted by the deep 
learning model as EGFR positive or negative with a sensitivity and specificity 
of 100.0% and 87.5%. The remaining 67% of the patients got an uncertain result 
and will be recommenced to perform further examination. By incorporating 
adenocarcinoma subtype information, we achieved 100% sensitivity in predicting 
EGFR mutations in 37.3% of adenocarcinoma patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the potential of a deep learning-based EGFR 
mutation prediction model for rapid and cost-effective pre-screening. It could 
serve as a high-accuracy complement to current molecular detection methods and 
provide treatment opportunities for non-small cell lung cancer patients from 
whom limited samples are available.
