BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) constitute 
inter-related clinical entities. Biomarker profiling emerges as a promising tool 
for the early diagnosis and risk stratification of either DM or CAD. However, 
studies assessing the predictive capacity of novel metabolomics biomarkers in 
coexistent CAD and DM are scarce.
METHODS: This post-hoc analysis of the CorLipid trial (NCT04580173) included 316 
patients with CAD and comorbid DM who underwent emergency or elective coronary 
angiography due to acute or chronic coronary syndrome. Cox regression analyses 
were performed to identify metabolomic predictors of the primary outcome, which 
was defined as the composite of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
events (MACCE: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, major 
bleeding), repeat unplanned revascularizations and cardiovascular 
hospitalizations. Linear regression analyses were also performed to detect 
significant predictors of CAD complexity, as assessed by the SYNTAX score.
RESULTS: After a median 2-year follow up period (IQR = 0.7 years), the primary 
outcome occurred in 69 (21.8%) of patients. Acylcarnitine ratio C4/C18:2, 
apolipoprotein (apo) B, history of heart failure (HF), age > 65 years and 
presence of acute coronary syndrome were independent predictors of the primary 
outcome in diabetic patients with CAD (aHR = 1.89 [1.09, 3.29]; 1.02 [1.01, 
1.04]; 1.28 [1.01, 1.41]; 1.04 [1.01, 1.05]; and 1.12 [1.05-1.21], 
respectively). Higher levels of ceramide ratio C24:1/C24:0, acylcarnitine ratio 
C4/C18:2, age > 65 and peripheral artery disease were independent predictors of 
higher CAD complexity (adjusted β = 7.36 [5.74, 20.47]; 3.02 [0.09 to 6.06]; 
3.02 [0.09, 6.06], respectively), while higher levels of apoA1 were independent 
predictors of lower complexity (adjusted β= - 0.65 [- 1.31, - 0.02]).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with comorbid DM and CAD, novel metabolomic biomarkers 
and metabolomics-based prediction models could be recruited to predict clinical 
outcomes and assess the complexity of CAD, thereby enabling the integration of 
personalized medicine into routine clinical practice. These associations should 
be interpreted taking into account the observational nature of this study, and 
thus, larger trials are needed to confirm its results and validate them in 
different and larger diabetic populations.
