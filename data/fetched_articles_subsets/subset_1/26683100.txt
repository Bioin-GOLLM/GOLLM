FOXO3, AKT1 and IGF-2R are critical members of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling 
pathway. Previous studies showed that polymorphisms (SNPs) in FOXO3, AKT1 and 
IGF-2R were associated with human longevity in Caucasian population. However, 
the association of these SNPs in different ethnic groups is often inconsistent. 
Here, we investigated the association of genetic variants in three genes with 
human longevity in Han Chinese population. Twelve SNPs from FOXO3, AKT1 and 
IGF-2R were selected and genotyped in 1202 long-lived individuals (nonagenarians 
and centenarians) and younger individuals. Rs9486902 of FOXO3 was found to be 
associated with human longevity in both genders combined in this study (allelic 
P = 0.002, corrected P = 0.024). The other eleven SNPs were not significantly 
associated with human longevity in Han Chinese population. The haplotypes TTCTT, 
CCTTC and CTCCT of FOXO3 as well as GGTCGG and GGTCAG of AKT1 were shown to have 
a significant difference between case and control (P =0.006, 2.78×10-5, 
4.68×10-6, 0.003,0.005, respectively). The estimated prevalence of diabetes and 
prediabetes in long-lived individuals was significantly lower than in common 
adult populations (P = 0.001, 2.3×10-26) .Therefore, the search for 
longevity-associated genes provides the identification of new potential targets 
beneficial for the treatment of diabetes.
