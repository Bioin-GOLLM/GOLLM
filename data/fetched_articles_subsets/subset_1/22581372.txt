We demonstrate three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution in live multicellular 
organisms using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Sparse multifocal 
illumination patterns generated by a digital micromirror device (DMD) allowed us 
to physically reject out-of-focus light, enabling 3D subdiffractive imaging in 
samples eightfold thicker than had been previously imaged with SIM. We imaged 
samples at one 2D image per second, at resolutions as low as 145 nm laterally 
and 400 nm axially. In addition to dual-labeled, whole fixed cells, we imaged 
GFP-labeled microtubules in live transgenic zebrafish embryos at depths >45 Î¼m. 
We captured dynamic changes in the zebrafish lateral line primordium and 
observed interactions between myosin IIA and F-actin in cells encapsulated in 
collagen gels, obtaining two-color 4D super-resolution data sets spanning tens 
of time points and minutes without apparent phototoxicity. Our method uses 
commercially available parts and open-source software and is simpler than 
existing SIM implementations, allowing easy integration with wide-field 
microscopes.
