BACKGROUND: Trachoma, a preventable blinding eye disease, is initiated by ocular 
infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct). We previously showed that microRNAs 
(miR) -147b and miR-1285 were up-regulated in inflammatory trachomatous 
scarring. During the initial stage of disease, follicular trachoma with current 
Ct infection, the differential expression of miR has not yet been investigated.
METHODS: Conjunctival samples were collected from 163 children aged 1-9 years 
old living in a trachoma-endemic region of Guinea Bissau, West Africa. Small RNA 
sequencing (RNAseq) was carried out on samples from five children with 
follicular trachoma and current Ct infection and five children with healthy 
conjunctivae and no Ct infection. Small RNAseq was also carried out on human 
epithelial cell lines infected with ocular Ct strains A2497 and isogenic 
plasmid-free A2497 in vitro. Results were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) 
in 163 clinical samples.
RESULTS: Differential expression of RNAseq data identified 12 miR with changes 
in relative expression during follicular trachoma, of which 9 were confirmed as 
differentially expressed by qPCR (miR-155, miR-150, miR-142, miR-181b, miR-181a, 
miR-342, miR-132, miR-4728 and miR-184). MiR-155 and miR-184 expression had a 
direct relationship with the degree of clinical inflammation. MiR-155 was 
up-regulated (OR = 2.533 ((95 % CI = 1.291-4.971); P = 0.0069) and miR-184 was 
down-regulated (OR = 0.416 ((95 % CI = 0.300-0.578); P = 1.61*10(-7)) as the 
severity of clinical inflammation increased. Differential miR expression was not 
detected in HEp-2 or HCjE epithelial cells 48 h post infection with Ct in vitro. 
HCjE cells, a conjunctival epithelial cell line, had a markedly different miR 
background expression compared to HEp-2 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In follicular trachoma, expression of miR-155 and miR-184 is 
correlated with the severity of inflammation. This likely reflects host 
regulation of the immune response and a prolonged period of wound healing 
following the clearance of Ct. Prolonged healing may be associated with 
subsequent development of scarring trachoma.
