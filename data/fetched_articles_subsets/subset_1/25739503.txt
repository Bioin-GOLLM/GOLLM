Eukaryotic cells initiate DNA replication from multiple origins, which must be 
tightly regulated to promote precise genome duplication in every cell cycle. To 
accomplish this, initiation is partitioned into two temporally discrete steps: a 
double hexameric minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex is first loaded at 
replication origins during G1 phase, and then converted to the active CMG 
(Cdc45-MCM-GINS) helicase during S phase. Here we describe the reconstitution of 
budding yeast DNA replication initiation with 16 purified replication factors, 
made from 42 polypeptides. Origin-dependent initiation recapitulates regulation 
seen in vivo. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibits MCM loading by 
phosphorylating the origin recognition complex (ORC) and promotes CMG formation 
by phosphorylating Sld2 and Sld3. Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) promotes 
replication by phosphorylating MCM, and can act either before or after CDK. 
These experiments define the minimum complement of proteins, protein kinase 
substrates and co-factors required for regulated eukaryotic DNA replication.
