The Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (TK) is the molecular hallmark of chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML). Src is another TK kinase whose involvement in CML was widely 
demonstrated. Small molecules active as dual Src/Bcr-Abl inhibitors emerged as 
effective targeted therapies for CML and a few compounds are currently in 
clinical use. In this study, we applied a target-oriented approach to identify a 
family of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines as dual Src/Bcr-Abl inhibitors as 
anti-leukemia agents. Considering the high homology between Src and Bcr-Abl, 
in-house Src inhibitors 8a-l and new analogue compounds 9a-n were screened as 
dual Src/Bcr-Abl inhibitors. The antiproliferative activity on K562 CML cells 
and the ADME profile were determined for the most promising compounds. Molecular 
modeling studies elucidated the binding mode of the inhibitors into the Bcr-Abl 
(wt) catalytic pocket. Compounds 8j and 8k showed nanomolar activities in 
enzymatic and cellular assays, together with favorable ADME properties, emerging 
as promising candidates for CML therapy. Finally, derivatives 9j and 9k, 
emerging as valuable inhibitors of the most aggressive Bcr-Abl mutation, T315I, 
constitute a good starting point in the search for compounds able to treat 
drug-resistant forms of CML. Overall, this study allowed us to identify more 
potent compounds than those previously reported by the group, marking a step 
forward in searching for new antileukemic agents.
