Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with 
cognitive dysfunction as its major clinical symptom. However, there is no 
disease-modifying small molecular medicine to effectively slow down progression 
of the disease. Here, we show an optimized asparagine endopeptidase (AEP, also 
known as δ-secretase) inhibitor, #11 A, that displays an orderly in vivo 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) relationship and robustly attenuates 
AD pathologies in a sporadic AD mouse model. #11 A is brain permeable with great 
oral bioavailability. It blocks AEP cleavage of APP and Tau dose-dependently, 
and significantly decreases Aβ40 and Aβ42 and p-Tau levels in APP/PS1 and Tau 
P301S mice after oral administration. Notably, #11 A strongly inhibits AEP and 
prevents mouse APP and Tau fragmentation by AEP, leading to reduction of mouse 
Aβ42 (mAβ42), mAβ40 and mouse p-Tau181 levels in Thy1-ApoE4/C/EBPβ transgenic 
mice in a dose-dependent manner. Repeated oral administration of #11 A 
substantially decreases mAβ aggregation as validated by Aβ PET assay, Tau 
pathology, neurodegeneration and brain volume reduction, resulting in 
alleviation of cognitive impairment. Therefore, our results support that #11 A 
is a disease-modifying preclinical candidate for pharmacologically treating AD.
