Eukaryotic cells use two principal mechanisms for repairing DNA double-strand 
breaks (DSBs): homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining 
(NHEJ). DSB repair pathway choice is strongly regulated during the cell cycle. 
Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activates HR by phosphorylation of key 
recombination factors. However, a mechanism for regulating the NHEJ pathway has 
not been established. Here, we report that Xlf1, a fission yeast XLF ortholog, 
is a key regulator of NHEJ activity in the cell cycle. We show that Cdk1 
phosphorylates residues in the C terminus of Xlf1 over the course of the cell 
cycle. Mutation of these residues leads to the loss of Cdk1 phosphorylation, 
resulting in elevated levels of NHEJ repair in vivo. Together, these data 
establish that Xlf1 phosphorylation by Cdc2(Cdk1) provides a molecular mechanism 
for downregulation of NHEJ in fission yeast and indicates that XLF is a key 
regulator of end-joining processes in eukaryotic organisms.
