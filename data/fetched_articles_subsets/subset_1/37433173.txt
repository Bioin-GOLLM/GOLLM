Combined use of amlodipine and folic acid are significantly more efficacious 
than amlodipine alone in lowering plasma homocysteine and blood pressure among 
hypertensive patients with hyperhomocysteinemia and intolerance to ACEI: A 
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled clinical trial.

Hyperhomocysteinemia with hypertension can synergistically increase the risk of 
stroke. The China stroke primary prevention trial showed that combining 0.8 mg 
folic acid (FA) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) can 
effectively lower plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and blood pressure (BP); and 
reduce first stroke risk by additional 21% compared to ACEI alone. However, 
intolerance to ACEI is common in Asians and amlodipine can be alternative. This 
is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled clinical trial 
(RCT) which evaluated whether amlodipine combined with FA is more efficacious 
than amlodipine alone in lowering tHcy and BP among Chinese hypertensive with 
hyperhomocysteinemia and intolerance to ACEI. 351 Eligible patients were 
randomly assigned by 1:1:1 ratio to receive amlodipine-FA tablet daily 
(amlodipine 5 mg/FA 0.4 mg, A group); amlodipine 5 mg/FA 0.8 mg tablet daily (B 
group); amlodipine 5 mg daily (C group, control group). Follow-up was conducted 
at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. The primary outcome was efficacy of lowering both tHcy 
and BP at the end of 8-week treatment. Compared with C group, A group had a 
significantly higher rate of lowering both tHcy and BP (23.3% vs. 6.0%; Odds 
Ratio [OR], 8.68; 95% CI, 3.04-24.78, P < .001); B group also had a higher rate 
of lowering both tHcy and BP (20.3% vs. 6.0%; OR: 5.90; 95% CI, 2.11-16.47, 
P < .001). This RCT showed amlodipine combined with FA compared with amlodipine 
alone, each had significantly higher efficacy of lowering both tHcy and BP. No 
difference was found in BP-lowering and occurrence of adverse events between the 
three groups.
