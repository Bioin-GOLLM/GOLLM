SLC35B4 belongs to the solute carrier 35 (SLC35) family whose best-characterized 
members display a nucleotide sugar transporting activity. Using an experimental 
model of HepG2 cells and indirect immunofluorescent staining, we verified that 
SLC35B4 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We demonstrated that 
dilysine motif, especially lysine at position 329, is crucial for the ER 
localization of this protein in human cells and therefore one should use protein 
C-tagging with caution. To verify the importance of the protein in 
glycoconjugates synthesis, we generated SLC35B4-deficient HepG2 cell line using 
CRISPR-Cas9 approach. Our data showed that knock-out of the SLC35B4 gene does 
not affect major UDP-Xyl- and UDP-GlcNAc-dependent glycosylation pathways.
