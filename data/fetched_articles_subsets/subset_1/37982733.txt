Antivirals are indispensable tools that can be targeted at viral domains 
directly or at cellular domains indirectly to obstruct viral infections and 
reduce pathogenicity. Despite their transformative use in healthcare, antivirals 
have been clinically approved to treat only 10 of the more than 200 known 
pathogenic human viruses. Additionally, many virus functions are intimately 
coupled with host cellular processes, which presents challenges in antiviral 
development due to the limited number of clear targets per virus, necessitating 
extensive insight into these molecular processes. Compounding this challenge, 
many viral pathogens have evolved to evade effective antivirals. We hypothesize 
that a viral attachment blocking chimera (VirABloC) composed of a viral binder 
and a bulky scaffold that sterically blocks interactions between a viral 
particle and a host cell may be suitable for the development of antivirals that 
are agnostic to the extravirion epitope that is being bound. We test this 
hypothesis by modifying a nanobody that specifically recognizes a nonessential 
epitope presented on the extravirion surface of pseudorabies virus strain 486 
with a 3-dimensional wireframe DNA origami structure ∼100 nm in diameter. The 
nanobody switches from having no inhibitory properties to 4.2 ± 0.9 nM IC50 when 
conjugated with the DNA origami scaffold. Mechanistic studies support that 
inhibition is mediated by the noncovalent attachment of the DNA origami scaffold 
to the virus particle, which obstructs the attachment of the viruses onto host 
cells. These results support the potential of VirABloC as a generalizable 
approach to developing antivirals.
