Smad1, Smad5 and Smad9 (also known as Smad8) are activated by phosphorylation by 
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-bound type I receptor kinases. We examined the 
role of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad9 by creating constitutively active forms 
(Smad(DVD)). Transcriptional activity of Smad9(DVD) was lower than that of 
Smad1(DVD) or Smad5(DVD), even though all three Smad(DVD)s associated with Smad4 
and bound to the target DNA. The linker region of Smad9 was sufficient to reduce 
transcriptional activity. Smad9 expression was increased by the activation of 
BMP signaling, similar to that of inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), and Smad9 reduced 
BMP activity. In contrast to I-Smads, however, Smad9 did not inhibit the type I 
receptor kinase and suppressed the constitutively active Smad1(DVD). Smad9 
formed complexes with Smad1 and bound to DNA but suppressed the transcription of 
the target gene. Taken together, our findings suggest that Smad9 is a new type 
of transcriptional regulator in BMP signaling.
