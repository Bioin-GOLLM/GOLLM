Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxias and 
Huntington's disease, are progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by CAG 
triplet-repeat expansion in the coding regions of disease-associated genes. In 
this study, we found that neurotoxic small CAG (sCAG) RNA species, microscopic 
Ataxin-2 CAG RNA foci, and protein aggregates exist as independent entities in 
cells. Synaptic defects and neurite outgrowth abnormalities were observed in 
mutant Ataxin-2-expressing mouse primary cortical neurons. We examined the 
suppression effects of the CAG RNA-binding peptide beta-structured inhibitor for 
neurodegenerative diseases (BIND) in mutant Ataxin-2-expressing mouse primary 
cortical neurons and found that both impaired synaptic phenotypes and neurite 
outgrowth defects were rescued. We further demonstrated that BIND rescued cell 
death through inhibiting sCAG RNA production, Ataxin-2 CAG RNA foci formation, 
and mutant Ataxin-2 protein translation. Interestingly, when the expanded CAG 
repeats in the mutant Ataxin-2 transcript was interrupted with the alternative 
glutamine codon CAA, BIND's inhibitory effect on mutant protein aggregation was 
lost. We previously demonstrated that BIND interacts physically and directly 
with expanded CAG RNA sequences. Our data provide evidence that the BIND peptide 
associates with transcribed mutant CAG RNA to inhibit the formation of toxic 
species, including sCAG RNA, RNA foci, and polyQ protein translation and 
aggregation.
