We investigated the patterns of recurrence and primary endocrine resistance 
according to estrogen receptor (ER) alpha gene (ESR1) mutations, as assessed by 
digital droplet (dd) PCR, in patients with non-metastatic ER+ breast cancer. We 
collected 121 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) surgical specimens from 
ER+ breast cancer patients who had relapsed after surgery. Genomic DNA was 
extracted from the FFPE samples and ESR1 mutations were evaluated using ddPCR. 
ESR1 mutations were detected in 9 (7.4%) of 121 primary breast cancer specimens. 
The median recurrence-free interval and overall survival were significantly 
lower in patients with ESR1 mutations than in those without. Of the patients 
treated with ET (N = 98), eight had ESR1 mutations. Of these, six (75.0%) had 
primary endocrine resistance and two (25.0%) had secondary endocrine resistance. 
By contrast, only 22 of 90 (24.4%) patients without ESR1 mutations had primary 
endocrine resistance. A multivariable model showed that an ESR1 mutation is a 
significant risk factor for primary endocrine resistance. Our findings provide 
clinical evidence that the presence of rare ESR1 mutant clones identified by 
ddPCR in primary tumors is associated with primary endocrine resistance in an 
adjuvant setting.
