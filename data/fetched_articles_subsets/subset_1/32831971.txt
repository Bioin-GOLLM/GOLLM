Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex and multifactorial autoimmune disorder 
with the involvement of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 50 RA genetic loci in 
European populations. Given the anticipated overlap of RA-relevant genes and 
pathways across different ethnic groups, we sought to replicate 58 
GWAS-implicated SNPs reported in Europeans in Pakistani subjects. 1,959 
unrelated subjects comprising 1,222 RA cases and 737 controls were collected 
from three rheumatology facilities in Pakistan. Genotyping was performed using 
iPLEX or TaqMan® methods. A total of 50 SNPs were included in the final 
association analysis after excluding those that failed assay design/run or 
postrun QC analysis. Fourteen SNPs (LINC00824/rs1516971, PADI4/rs2240336, 
CEP57/rs4409785, CTLA4/rs3087243, STAT4/rs13426947, HLA-B/MICA/rs2596565, 
C5orf30/rs26232, CCL21/rs951005, GATA3/rs2275806, VPS37C/rs595158, 
HLA-DRB1/rs660895, EOMES/rs3806624, SPRED2/rs934734, and RUNX1/rs9979383) were 
replicated in our Pakistani sample at false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.20 with 
nominal p values ranging from 4.73E-06 to 3.48E-02. Our results indicate that 
several RA susceptibility loci are shared between Pakistani and European 
populations, supporting the role of common genes/pathways.
