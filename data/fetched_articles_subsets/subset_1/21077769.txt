δ-Thalassemia (δ-thal) has no clinical symptoms, but its coinheritance with 
β-thal may cause misdiagnosis, especially in countries with a high prevalence of 
β-thal where prevention programs have been implemented. The molecular basis of 
most β-thal syndromes have been defined, while the spectrum of mutations causing 
δ-thal have not been well characterized. A couple was referred to us for 
thalassemia molecular screening. Since she had rather low values of Hb A₂ and 
normal Hb F, her δ-globin gene was amplified and directly sequenced. We found 
two different mutations on her δ-globin genes: HBD: c.92+5G>T/HBD:c.428C>A. The 
c.92+5G>T mutation has not been previously reported. Two different mutations in 
trans may explain the reduced Hb A₂ level.
