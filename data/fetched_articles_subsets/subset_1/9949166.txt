We investigated the mechanisms responsible for severe factor VII (FVII) 
deficiency in homozygous Italian patients with either Gly97Cys or Gln100Arg 
mutations in the second epidermal growth factor domain of FVII. Transient 
expression of complementary DNA coding for the mutations in COS-1 cells showed 
impaired secretion of the mutant molecules. Using stably transfected Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, we performed pulse-chase labeling studies, 
immunohistochemistry, and experiments with inhibitors of protein degradation, 
showing that FVII-Cys97 did not accumulate intracellularly but was degraded in a 
pre-Golgi, nonlysosomal compartment by a cysteine protease. In stably 
transfected CHO cells expressing FVII-Arg100, the level of intracellular FVII 
was not increased by several inhibitors of protein degradation, but FVII-Arg100 
was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum for a longer period of time than 
wild-type FVII. FVII-Arg100 had a lower apparent molecular weight than did 
wild-type FVII under nondenaturing conditions, which is attributable to 
misfolding due to abnormal disulfide bond formation.
