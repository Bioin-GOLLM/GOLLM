Mutations in the gap junction protein gamma-2 gene, GJC2, cause a central 
hypomyelinating disorder; Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD; MIM311601). 
Using a homozygosity mapping and positional candidate gene approach, we 
identified a homozygous mutation (c.-167A>G) within the GJC2 promoter at a 
potent SOX10 binding site in a patient with mild PMLD. Functionally, this 
mutation completely abolished the SOX10 binding and attenuated GJC2 promoter 
activity. These findings suggest not only that the SOX10-to-GJC2 transcriptional 
dysregulation is a cause of PMLD, but also that GJC2 may be in part responsible 
for the central hypomyelination caused by SOX10 mutations.
