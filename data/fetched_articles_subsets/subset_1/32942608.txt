The hepatitis E virus (HEV) hypervariable region (HVR) presents the highest 
divergence of the entire HEV genome. It is characteristically rich in proline, 
and so is also known as the "polyproline region" (PPR). HEV genotype 3 (HEV-3) 
exhibits different PPR lengths due to insertions, PPR and/or RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase (RdRp) duplications and deletions. A total of 723 PPR-HEV sequences 
were analyzed, of which 137 HEV-3 sequences were obtained from clinical 
specimens (from acute and chronic infection) by Sanger sequencing. Eight swine 
stool/liver samples were also analyzed. N- and C-terminal fragments were 
confirmed as being conserved, but they harbored differences between genotypes 
and were not proline-plentiful regions. The genuine PPR is the intermediate 
region between them. HEV-3 PPR contains a higher percentage (30.4%) of prolines 
than other genotypes. We describe for the first time: (1) the specific placement 
of HEV-3 PPR rearrangements in sites 1 to 14 of the PPR, noting that 
duplications are more frequently attached to sites 11 and 12 (AAs 74-79 and 
113-118, respectively); (2) the cadence of repetitions follows a circular-like 
pattern of blocks A to J, with F, G, H, and I being the most frequent; (3) a 
previously unreported insertion homologous to apolipoprotein C1; and (4) the 
increase in frequency of potential N-glycosylation sites and differences in AAs 
composition related to duplications.
