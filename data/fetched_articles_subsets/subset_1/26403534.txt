Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetically determined, life-limiting 
disorder in populations of European ancestry. The genetic basis of cystic 
fibrosis is well established to be mutations in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that codes for an apical 
membrane chloride channel principally expressed by epithelial cells. 
Conventional approaches to cystic fibrosis care involve a heavy daily burden of 
supportive treatments to combat lung infection, help clear airway secretions and 
maintain nutritional status. In 2012, a new era of precision medicine in cystic 
fibrosis therapeutics began with the licensing of a small molecule, ivacaftor, 
which successfully targets the underlying defect and improves CFTR function in a 
subgroup of patients in a genotype-specific manner. Here, we review the three 
main targeted approaches that have been adopted to improve CFTR function: 
potentiators, which recover the function of CFTR at the apical surface of 
epithelial cells that is disrupted in class III and IV genetic mutations; 
correctors, which improve intracellular processing of CFTR, increasing surface 
expression, in class II mutations; and production correctors or read-through 
agents, which promote transcription of CFTR in class I mutations. The further 
development of such approaches offers great promise for future therapeutic 
strategies in cystic fibrosis.
