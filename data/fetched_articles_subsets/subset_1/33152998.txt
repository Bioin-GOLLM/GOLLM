The Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutation is detected in 
8-12% of metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRCs) and is strongly correlated with 
poor prognosis. The recent success of the BEACON CRC study and the development 
of targeted therapy have led to the determination of BRAF-mutated mCRCs as an 
independent category. For nearly two decades, a growing body of evidence has 
established the significance of the BRAF mutation in the development of CRC. 
Herein, we overview both basic and clinical data relevant to BRAF-mutated CRC, 
mainly focusing on the development of treatment strategies. This review is 
organized into eight sections, including clinicopathological features, molecular 
features, prognosis, the predictive value of anti-epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) therapy, resistant mechanisms for BRAF-targeting treatment, the 
heterogeneity of the BRAF mutation, future perspectives, and conclusions. A 
characterization of the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway is essential for controlling this malignancy, and the optimal 
combination of multiple interventions for treatments remains a point of debate.
