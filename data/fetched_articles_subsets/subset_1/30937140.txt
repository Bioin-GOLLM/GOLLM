BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoid-induced 
transcript 1 gene (GLCCI1) rs37973 mutant genotype is associated with poor 
inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) response in asthmatics. As human airway relaxation 
is regulated by circulation epinephrine, which can be enhanced by 
corticosteroid. It is unknown whether or not GLCCI1 rs37973 is associated with 
circulation epinephrine and cortisol concentrations in asthma. The aim of this 
study is to evaluate these relationships.
METHODS: A total of 182 asthmatics and 180 healthy controls were recruited for 
the study. 30 mild-to-moderate asthmatics received fluticasone propionate 
(125 μg, bid) treatment for 12 weeks. GLCCI1 rs37973 genotyping was performed 
with the iPlex MassARRAY genotyping platform. The plasma concentrations of 
cortisol and epinephrine of each participant were detected by enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits.
RESULTS: GLCCI1 rs37973 homozygotes mutant genotype GG had a higher plasma 
epinephrine concentration (median concentration 27.032 pg/ml, nGG = 36; median 
concentration 23.149 pg/ml, nAA+AG = 146; P = 0.015) and cortisol concentration 
(median concentration 1.141 ng/ml, nGG = 36; median concentration 0.921 ng/ml, 
nAA+AG = 146; P = 0.013). Both epinephrine concentration and cortisol 
concentration in plasma were positively correlated with FEV1 (r = 0.889 and 
r = 0.821, respectively. nasthma = 182). For asthmatics treated with ICS, 
rs37973 was associated with change in plasma epinephrine and cortisol 
concentration in a recessive model (AA + AG vs GG), with GG had less improvement 
in epinephrine concentration [ΔEPIAA+AG = 6.843 (9.26) pg/ml, nAA+AG = 26; 
ΔEPIGG = -1.666 (6.52) pg/ml, nGG = 4; P = 0.018] and cortisol concentration 
[ΔCORAA+AG = 0.3040 (0.21) ng/ml, nAA+AG = 26; ΔCORGG = -0.066 (0.24) ng/ml, 
nGG = 4; P = 0.009].
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that the poor ICS response in GLCCI1 rs37973 
mutant genotype might be related to the less increased amplitudes of plasma 
epinephrine and cortisol in asthmatic patients.
