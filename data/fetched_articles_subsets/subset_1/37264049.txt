Although homologous protein sequences are expected to adopt similar structures, 
some amino acid substitutions can interconvert α-helices and β-sheets. Such fold 
switching may have occurred over evolutionary history, but supporting evidence 
has been limited by the: (1) abundance and diversity of sequenced genes, (2) 
quantity of experimentally determined protein structures, and (3) assumptions 
underlying the statistical methods used to infer homology. Here, we overcome 
these barriers by applying multiple statistical methods to a family of ~600,000 
bacterial response regulator proteins. We find that their homologous DNA-binding 
subunits assume divergent structures: helix-turn-helix versus α-helix + β-sheet 
(winged helix). Phylogenetic analyses, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and 
AlphaFold2 models indicate that amino acid substitutions facilitated a switch 
from helix-turn-helix into winged helix. This structural transformation likely 
expanded DNA-binding specificity. Our approach uncovers an evolutionary pathway 
between two protein folds and provides a methodology to identify secondary 
structure switching in other protein families.
