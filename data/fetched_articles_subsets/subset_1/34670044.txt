BACKGROUND: Variability in ultrafiltration influences prescriptions and outcomes 
in patients with kidney failure who are treated with peritoneal dialysis. 
Variants in AQP1, the gene that encodes the archetypal water channel 
aquaporin-1, may contribute to that variability.
METHODS: We gathered clinical and genetic data from 1851 patients treated with 
peritoneal dialysis in seven cohorts to determine whether AQP1 variants were 
associated with peritoneal ultrafiltration and with a risk of the composite of 
death or technique failure (i.e., transfer to hemodialysis). We performed 
studies in cells, mouse models, and samples obtained from humans to characterize 
an AQP1 variant and investigate mitigation strategies.
RESULTS: The common AQP1 promoter variant rs2075574 was associated with 
peritoneal ultrafiltration. Carriers of the TT genotype at rs2075574 (10 to 16% 
of patients) had a lower mean (±SD) net ultrafiltration level than carriers of 
the CC genotype (35 to 47% of patients), both in the discovery phase (506±237 ml 
vs. 626±283 ml, P = 0.007) and in the validation phase (368±603 ml vs. 563±641 
ml, P = 0.003). After a mean follow-up of 944 days, 139 of 898 patients (15%) 
had died and 280 (31%) had been transferred to hemodialysis. TT carriers had a 
higher risk of the composite of death or technique failure than CC carriers 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 2.33; 
P = 0.001), as well as a higher risk of death from any cause (24% vs. 15%, 
P = 0.03). In mechanistic studies, the rs2075574 risk variant was associated 
with decreases in AQP1 promoter activity, aquaporin-1 expression, and 
glucose-driven osmotic water transport. The use of a colloid osmotic agent 
mitigated the effects of the risk variant.
CONCLUSIONS: A common variant in AQP1 was associated with decreased 
ultrafiltration and an increased risk of death or technique failure among 
patients treated with peritoneal dialysis. (Funded by the Swiss National Science
