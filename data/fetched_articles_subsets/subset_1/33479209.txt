Biofilms contribute to bacterial infection and drug resistance and are a serious 
threat to global human health. Antibacterial nanomaterials have attracted 
considerable attention, but the inhibition of biofilms remains a major 
challenge. Herein, we propose a nanohole-boosted electron transport (NBET) 
antibiofilm concept. Unlike known antibacterial mechanisms (e.g., reactive 
oxygen species production and cell membrane damage), nanoholes with atomic 
vacancies and biofilms serve as electronic donors and receptors, respectively, 
and thus boost the high electron transport capacity between nanomaterials and 
biofilms. Electron transport effectively destroys the critical components 
(proteins, intercellularly adhered polysaccharides and extracellular DNA) of 
biofilms, and the nanoholes also significantly downregulate the expression of 
genes related to biofilm formation. The anti-infection capacity is thoroughly 
verified both in vitro (human cells) and in vivo (rat ocular and mouse 
intestinal infection models), and the nanohole-enabled nanomaterials are found 
to be highly biocompatible. Importantly, compared with typical antibiotics, 
nanomaterials are nonresistant and thereby exhibit high potential for use in 
various applications. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, these findings hold 
promise for the use of NBET in treatments for pathogenic bacterial infection and 
antibiotic drug resistance.
