Systemic mastocytosis is a rare and heterogeneous disease characterized by mast 
cell proliferation and activation. KIT is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase which 
plays a key role in mast cell growth, differentiation and survival. After 
interaction with its ligand, the stem cell factor, KIT dimerizes activating 
downstream pathways involving multiple tyrosine kinases (PI3K, JAK/STAT, 
RAS/ERK). Activating mutations in KIT are detected in most cases of systemic 
mastocytosis, being the most common KIT D816V. Therefore, since the emergence of 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, KIT inhibition has been an attractive approach when 
facing mastocytosis treatment. Initial reports showed that only the rare KIT 
D816V negative cases were responsive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, the 
development of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as midostaurin or avapritinib 
with activity against mast cells carrying the D816V KIT mutation, has changed 
the landscape of this disease.
