BACKGROUND: It is possible that the relative lack of progress in treatment 
outcomes among adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer is caused 
by a difference in disease biology compared with the corresponding diseases in 
younger and older individuals. There is evidence that colon cancer is more 
aggressive and has a poorer prognosis in AYA patients than in older adult 
patients.
METHODS: To further understand the molecular basis for this difference, 
whole-exome sequencing was conducted on a cohort of 30 adult, 30 AYA, and 2 
pediatric colon cancers.
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in mutational frequency was 
observed between AYA and adult samples in 43 genes, including ROBO1, MYC binding 
protein 2 (MYCBP2), breast cancer 2 (early onset) (BRCA2), MAP3K3, MCPH1, 
RASGRP3, PTCH1, RAD9B, CTNND1, ATM, NF1; KIT, PTEN, and FBXW7. Many of these 
mutations were nonsynonymous, missense, stop-gain, or frameshift mutations that 
were damaging. Next, RNA sequencing was performed on a subset of the samples to 
confirm the mutations identified by exome sequencing. This confirmation study 
verified the presence of a significantly greater frequency of damaging mutations 
in AYA compared with adult colon cancers for 5 of the 43 genes (MYCBP2, BRCA2, 
PHLPP1, TOPORS, and ATR).
CONCLUSIONS: The current results provide the rationale for a more comprehensive 
study with a larger sample set and experimental validation of the functional 
impact of the identified variants along with their contribution to the biologic 
and clinical characteristics of AYA colon cancer. Cancer 2018;124:1070-82. ©
