Mutations in FUS and TBK1 often cause aggressive early-onset amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) or a late-onset ALS and/or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 
phenotype, respectively. Co-occurrence of mutations in two or more Mendelian 
ALS/FTD genes has been repeatedly reported. However, little is known how two 
pathogenic ALS/FTD mutations in the same patient interact to shape the final 
phenotype. We screened 28 ALS patients with a known FUS mutation by whole-exome 
sequencing and targeted evaluation for mutations in other known ALS genes 
followed by genotype-phenotype correlation analysis of FUS/TBK1 double-mutant 
patients. We report on new and summarize previously published FUS and TBK1 
double-mutant ALS/FTD patients and their families. We found that, within a 
family, mutations in FUS cause ALS while TBK1 single mutations are observed in 
FTD patients. FUS/TBK1 double mutations manifested as ALS and without a manifest 
difference regarding age at onset and disease duration when compared to FUS 
single-mutant individuals. In conclusion, TBK1 and FUS variants do not seem to 
interact in a simple additive way. Rather, the phenotype of FUS/TBK1 
double-mutant patients appears to be dominated by the FUS mutation.
