The diagnosis of polycythemia, particularly the secondary forms, can be 
challenging. The distinction between primary and secondary polycythemia is 
relevant and has management implications. A systematic diagnostic workup 
algorithm and a good anamnesis are of paramount relevance. More than one cause 
may be involved in the development of polycythemia, identifying all of them will 
be the key to better understanding and eventually solving the polycythemia. We 
describe a case of a 53-year-old Swiss woman with polycythemia and a high level 
of carboxyhemoglobin. Her medical story included obesity and obstructive sleep 
apnea. The anamnesis ruled out the habit of smoking cigarettes; however, the 
patient reported that she was on a trip to Egypt 10 years before and bought 
herself a shisha; since then, she used to smoke shisha daily, at home, alone. 
After drastically reducing and then stopping the shisha smoking, 7 months later 
her blood count and carboxyhemoglobin completely normalized.
