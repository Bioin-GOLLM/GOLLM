Iatrogenic tumorigenesis is a major limitation for the use of human induced 
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in hematology. The teratoma risk comes from the 
persistence of hiPSCs in differentiated cell populations. Our goal was to 
evaluate the best system to purge residual hiPSCs before graft without 
compromising hematopoietic repopulation capability. Teratoma risk after systemic 
injection of hiPSCs expressing the reporter gene luciferase was assessed for the 
first time. Teratoma formation in immune-deficient mice was tracked by in vivo 
bioimaging. We observed that systemic injection of hiPSCs produced multisite 
teratoma as soon as 5 weeks after injection. To eliminate hiPSCs before 
grafting, we tested the embryonic-specific expression of suicide genes under the 
control of the pmiR-302/367 promoter. This promoter was highly active in hiPSCs 
but not in differentiated cells. The gene/prodrug inducible Caspase-9 
(iCaspase-9)/AP20187 was more efficient and rapid than thymidine 
kinase/ganciclovir, fully specific, and without bystander effect. We observed 
that iCaspase-9-expressing hiPSCs died in a dose-dependent manner with AP20187, 
without reaching full eradication in vitro. Unexpectedly, nonspecific toxicity 
of AP20187 on iCaspase-9-negative hiPSCs and on CD34+ cells was evidenced in 
vitro. This toxic effect strongly impaired CD34+ -derived human hematopoiesis in 
adoptive transfers. Survivin inhibition is an alternative to the suicide gene 
approach because hiPSCs fully rely on survivin for survival. Survivin inhibitor 
YM155 was more efficient than AP20187/iCaspase-9 for killing hiPSCs, without 
toxicity on CD34+ cells, in vitro and in adoptive transfers. hiPSC purge by 
survivin inhibitor fully eradicated teratoma formation in immune-deficient mice. 
This will be useful to improve the safety management for hiPSC-based medicine.
