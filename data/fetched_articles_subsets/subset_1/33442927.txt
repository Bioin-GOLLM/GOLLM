SCYL1 disease results from biallelic pathogenic variants in SCYL1. We report two 
new patients with severe hepatic phenotype requiring liver transplantation. 
Patient charts reviewed. DNA samples and skin fibroblasts were utilized. 
Literature was reviewed. 13-year-old boy and 9-year-old girl siblings had acute 
liver insufficiency and underwent living related donor liver transplantation in 
infancy with no genetic diagnosis. Both had tremor, global developmental delay, 
and cognitive dysfunction during their follow-up in the medical genetic clinic 
for diagnostic investigations after their liver transplantation. Exome 
sequencing identified a likely pathogenic variant (c.399delC; p.Asn133Lysfs*136) 
in SCYL1. Deletion/duplication analysis of SCYL1 identified deletions of exons 
7-8 in Patient 1. Both variants were confirmed in Patient 2 and the diagnosis of 
SCYL1 disease was confirmed in both patients at the age of 13 and 9 years, 
respectively. SCYL1 protein was not expressed in both patients' fibroblast using 
western blot analysis. Sixteen patients with SCYL1 disease reported in the 
literature. Liver phenotype (n = 16), neurological phenotype (n = 13) and 
skeletal phenotype (n = 11) were present. Both siblings required liver 
transplantation in infancy and had variable phenotypes. Exome sequencing may 
miss the diagnosis and phenotyping of patients can help to diagnose patients.
