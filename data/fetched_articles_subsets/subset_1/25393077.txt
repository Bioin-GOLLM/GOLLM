Proteinogenic amino acid residues that promote β-sheet secondary structure are 
hydrophobic (e.g., Ile or Val) or only moderately polar (e.g., Thr). The design 
of peptides intended to display β-sheet secondary structure in water typically 
requires one set of residues to ensure conformational stability and an 
orthogonal set, with charged side chains, to ensure aqueous solubility and 
discourage self-association. Here we describe new amino acids that manifest 
substantial β-sheet propensity, by virtue of β-branching, and also bear an 
ionizable group in the side chain.
