Mitochondria contain their own genetic information and a dedicated translation 
system to express it. The mitochondrial ribosome is assembled from 
mitochondrial-encoded RNA and nuclear-encoded ribosomal proteins. Assembly is 
coordinated in the mitochondrial matrix by biogenesis factors that transiently 
associate with the maturing particle. Here, we present a structural snapshot of 
a large mitoribosomal subunit assembly intermediate containing 7 biogenesis 
factors including the GTPases GTPBP7 and GTPBP10. Our structure illustrates how 
GTPBP10 aids the folding of the ribosomal RNA during the biogenesis process, how 
this process is related to bacterial ribosome biogenesis, and why mitochondria 
require two biogenesis factors in contrast to only one in bacteria.
