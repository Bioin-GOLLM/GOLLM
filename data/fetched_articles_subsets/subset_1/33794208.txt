BACKGROUND: Most uterine cervical high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) 
infections are transient, with only a small fraction developing into cervical 
cancer. Family aggregation studies and heritability estimates suggest a 
significant inherited genetic component. Candidate gene studies and previous 
genome-wide association studies (GWASs) report associations between the HLA 
region and cervical cancer. Adopting a genome-wide approach, we aimed to compare 
genetic variation in women with invasive cervical cancer and cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 with that in healthy controls.
METHODS: We did a GWAS in a cohort of unrelated European individuals using data 
from UK Biobank, a population-based cohort including 273 377 women aged 40-69 
years at recruitment between March 13, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010. We used an 
additive univariate logistic regression model to analyse genetic variants 
associated with invasive cervical cancer or CIN3. We sought replication of 
candidate associations in FinnGen, a large independent dataset of 128 123 
individuals. We also did a two-sample mendelian randomisation approach to 
explore the role of risk factors in the genetic risk of cervical cancer.
FINDINGS: We included 4769 CIN3 and invasive cervical cancer case samples and 
145 545 control samples in the GWAS. Of 9 600 464 assayed and imputed 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), six independent variants were associated 
with CIN3 and invasive cervical cancer. These included novel loci rs10175462 
(PAX8; odds ratio [OR] 0·87, 95% CI 0·84-0·91; p=1·07 × 10-9) and rs27069 
(CLPTM1L; 0·88, 0·84-0·92; p=2·51 × 10-9), and previously reported signals at 
rs9272050 (HLA-DQA1; 1·27, 1·21-1·32; p=2·51 × 10-28), rs6938453 (MICA; 0·79, 
0·75-0·83; p=1·97 × 10-17), rs55986091 (HLA-DQB1; 0·66, 0·60-0·72; 
p=6·42 × 10-28), and rs9266183 (HLA-B; 0·73, 0·64-0·83; p=1·53 × 10-6). Three 
SNPs were replicated in the independent Finnish dataset of 1648 invasive 
cervical cancer cases: PAX8 (rs10175462; p=0·015), CLPTM1L (rs27069; 
p=2·54 × 10-7), and HLA-DQA1 (rs9272050; p=7·90 × 10-8). Mendelian randomisation 
further supported the complementary role of smoking (OR 2·46, 95% CI 1·64-3·69), 
older age at first pregnancy (0·80, 0·68-0·95), and number of sexual partners 
(1·95, 1·44-2·63) in the risk of developing cervical cancer.
INTERPRETATION: Our results provide new evidence for the genetic susceptibility 
to cervical cancer, specifically the PAX8, CLPTM1L, and HLA genes, suggesting 
disruption in apoptotic and immune function pathways. Future studies integrating 
host and viral, genetic, and epigenetic variation, could further elucidate 
complex host-viral interactions.
