Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for atrial fibrillation (AF) have 
uncovered numerous disease-associated variants. Their underlying molecular 
mechanisms, especially consequences for mRNA and protein expression remain 
largely elusive. Thus, refined multi-omics approaches are needed for deciphering 
the underlying molecular networks. Here, we integrate genomics, transcriptomics, 
and proteomics of human atrial tissue in a cross-sectional study to identify 
widespread effects of genetic variants on both transcript (cis-eQTL) and protein 
(cis-pQTL) abundance. We further establish a novel targeted trans-QTL approach 
based on polygenic risk scores to determine candidates for AF core genes. Using 
this approach, we identify two trans-eQTLs and five trans-pQTLs for AF GWAS 
hits, and elucidate the role of the transcription factor NKX2-5 as a link 
between the GWAS SNP rs9481842 and AF. Altogether, we present an integrative 
multi-omics method to uncover trans-acting networks in small datasets and 
provide a rich resource of atrial tissue-specific regulatory variants for 
transcript and protein levels for cardiovascular disease gene prioritization.
