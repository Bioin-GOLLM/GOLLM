BACKGROUND: The E4 allele of the APOE gene is known to be associated with 
cognitive impairment. However, a limited number of studies have examined the 
association between the E2 allele and longitudinal changes of cognitive 
function.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether rates of cognitive change differ in carriers of 
the APOE E2 allele compared to other genotypes.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from two ongoing longitudinal 
cohort studies, the Long Life Family Study (LLFS) and New England Centenarian 
Study (NECS). We included participants who had APOE genotyping data, data from 
longitudinal administrations of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status 
(TICS), and age, sex, and education available. We assessed whether cognitive 
change as measured by rate of decline in TICS score differed among people with 
different APOE genotypes. We used a hierarchical mixed effect model with APOE 
genotypes, their interactions with age, and potential confounders.
RESULTS: After adjusting for sex and education, in carriers of the common E3/E3 
genotype, TICS score decreased by 0.15 points per year of age. In those with the 
E2/E2 genotype, TICS score decreased by 0.05 points per year of age, a 
significantly slower rate of decline (p = 0.017). We observed no protective 
effect of the E2/E3 genotype on cognitive decline.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest a protective effect of the E2/E2 genotype on a 
measure of global cognitive function.
