Glutamate transporter solute carrier family 1, member 2 (GLT1/EAAT2), a major 
modulator of glutamate homeostasis in astrocytes, is assessed in post-mortem 
human brain samples of frontal cortex area 8 in advanced stages of Alzheimer 
disease (AD) and terminal stages of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in order to 
gain understanding of astrogliopathy in diseases manifested by dementia. Glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA expression is significantly increased in 
AD but not in DLB, whereas GLT1, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGLUT1) and 
aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member 1 (ALDH1L1) are not modified in AD and 
DLB when compared with controls. GLT1 protein levels are not altered in AD and 
DLB but GFAP and ALDH1L1 are significantly increased in AD, and GFAP in DLB. As 
a result, a non-significant decrease in the ratio between GLT1 and GFAP, and 
between GLT1 and ALDH1L1, is found in both AD and DLB. Double-labeling 
immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy revealed no visible reduction of GLT1 
immunoreactivity in relation to β-amyloid plaques in AD. These data suggest a 
subtle imbalance between GLT1, and GFAP and ALDH1L1 expression, with limited 
consequences in glutamate transport.
