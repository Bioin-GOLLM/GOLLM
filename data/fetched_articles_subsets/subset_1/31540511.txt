Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) displays a marked fibro-inflammatory 
microenvironment in which infiltrated immune cells fail to eliminate the tumor 
cells and often-rather paradoxically-promote tumor progression. Of special 
interest are tumor-promoting T cells that assume a Th17-like phenotype because 
their presence in PDAC tissue is associated with a poor prognosis. In that 
context, the role of IL-21, a major cytokine released by Th17-like cells, was 
assessed. In all tissue samples (n = 264) IL-21+ immune cells were detected by 
immunohistochemistry and high density of those cells was associated with poor 
prognosis. In the majority of patients (221/264), tumor cells expressed the 
receptor for IL-21 (IL-21R) and also a downstream target of IL-21, Blimp-1 
(199/264). Blimp-1 expression closely correlated with IL-21R expression and 
multivariate analysis revealed that expression of both IL-21R and Blimp-1 was 
associated with shorter survival time of the patients. In vitro data using 
pancreatic tumor cells lines provided a possible explanation: IL-21 activated 
ERK and STAT3 pathways and upregulated Blimp-1. Moreover, IL-21 increased 
invasion of tumor cell lines in a Blimp-1-dependent manner. As an in vivo 
correlate, an avian xenograft model was used. Here again Blimp-1 expression was 
significantly upregulated in IL-21 stimulated tumor cells. In summary, our data 
showed an association of IL-21+ immune cell infiltration and IL-21 receptor 
expression in PDAC with poor survival, most likely due to an IL-21-mediated 
promotion of tumor cell invasion and enhanced colony formation, supporting the 
notion of the tumor-promoting abilities of the tumor microenvironment.
