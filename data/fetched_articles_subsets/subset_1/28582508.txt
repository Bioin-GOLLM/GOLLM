Functional studies have elucidated the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) pathway in breast carcinogenesis, but to date, there is a paucity of data 
on its contribution to breast cancer risk in women of African ancestry. We 
examined 47628 SNPs in 61 mTOR pathway genes in the genome wide association 
study of breast cancer in the African Diaspora study (The Root consortium), 
which included 3686 participants (1657 cases). Pathway- and gene-level analyses 
were conducted using the adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) test for 10994 
SNPs that were not highly correlated (r2 < 0.8). Odds ratio (OR) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) were estimated with logistic regression for each 
single-nucleotide polymorphism. The mTOR pathway was significantly associated 
with overall and estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer risk (P = 0.003 
and 0.03, respectively). PRKAG3 (Padj = 0.0018) and RPS6KA3 (Padj = 0.061) were 
the leading genes for the associations with overall breast cancer risk and ER- 
breast cancer risk, respectively. rs190843378 in PRKAG3 was statistically 
significant after gene-level adjustment for multiple comparisons (OR = 0.50 for 
each T allele, 95% CI = 0.38-0.66, Padj = 3.6E-05), with a statistical power of 
0.914. These results provide new insights on the biological relevance of the 
mTOR pathway in breast cancer progression and underscore the need for more 
genetic epidemiology studies of breast cancer in the African Diaspora.
