We investigated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the aldehyde 
dehydrogenase family1 L1 gene (ALDH1L1) and their association with neural tube 
defects (NTDs) in the Chinese population. A total of 271 NTDs cases and 192 
healthy controls were used in this study. A total of 112 selected SNPs in the 
ALDH1L1 gene were analyzed using the next-generation sequencing method. 
Statistical analysis was carried out to investigate the correlation between SNPs 
and patient susceptibility to NTDs. Statistical analysis revealed a significant 
correlation between the SNP sites rs4646733, rs2305225, and rs2276731 in the 
ALDH1L1 gene and NTDs. The TT genotype and T allele of rs4646733 in ALDH1L1 were 
associated with a significantly increased incidence of NTDs [odds ratio 
(OR) = 2.16, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.199-3.896 for genotype; and 
OR = 1.46, 95 % CI 1.092-1.971 for allele]. The AA genotype and A allele of 
rs2305225 in ALDH1L1 were associated with a significantly increased incidence of 
NTDs (OR = 2.03, 95 % CI 1.202-3.646 for genotype, and OR = 1.44, 95 % CI 
1.096-1.905 for allele). The CT genotype and C allele of rs2276731 in ALDH1L1 
significantly were associated with an increased incidence of NTDs (OR = 1.67, 
95 % CI 1.129-2.491 with genotype, and OR = 1.32, 95 % CI 0.956-1.816 with 
allele).The polymorphic loci rs4646733, rs2305225, and rs2276731 in the ALDH1L1 
gene maybe potential risk factors for NTDs in the Chinese population.
