Allelic imbalance (AI) indicates the presence of functional variation in cis 
regulatory regions. Detecting cis regulatory differences using AI is widespread, 
yet there is no formal statistical methodology that tests whether AI differs 
between conditions. Here, we present a novel model and formally test differences 
in AI across conditions using Bayesian credible intervals. The approach tests AI 
by environment (G×E) interactions, and can be used to test AI between 
environments, genotypes, sex, and any other condition. We incorporate bias into 
the modeling process. Bias is allowed to vary between conditions, making the 
formulation of the model general. As gene expression affects power for detection 
of AI, and, as expression may vary between conditions, the model explicitly 
takes coverage into account. The proposed model has low type I and II error 
under several scenarios, and is robust to large differences in coverage between 
conditions. We reanalyze RNA-seq data from a Drosophila melanogaster population 
panel, with F1 genotypes, to compare levels of AI between mated and virgin 
female flies, and we show that AI × genotype interactions can also be tested. To 
demonstrate the use of the model to test genetic differences and interactions, a 
formal test between two F1s was performed, showing the expected 20% difference 
in AI. The proposed model allows a formal test of G×E and G×G, and reaffirms a 
previous finding that cis regulation is robust between environments.
