TRAIL is a member of the TNF superfamily that induces tumor-selective cell death 
by engaging the pro-apoptotic death receptors DR4 and DR5. The antitumor 
potential of the TRAIL pathway has been targeted by several therapeutic 
approaches including recombinant TRAIL and TRAIL-receptor agonist antibodies 
among others. Interest in sensitizing tumor cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis 
has driven investigations of TRAIL-receptor gene regulation, though regulation 
of the TRAIL gene has been less studied. Physiologically, TRAIL serves as a 
pro-apoptotic effector molecule in the immune surveillance of cancer that is 
conditionally expressed by immune cells upon stimulation via an 
interferon-response element that was identified in early studies of the TRAIL 
gene promoter. Here, we map the TRAIL gene promoter and review studies of TRAIL 
gene regulation that involve several modalities of gene regulation including 
transcription factors, epigenetics, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 
functionally distinct isoforms.
