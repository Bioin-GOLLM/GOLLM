BACKGROUND: One challenge in prostate cancer is distinguishing indolent from 
aggressive disease at diagnosis. DNA promoter hypermethylation is a frequent 
epigenetic event in prostate cancer, but few studies of DNA methylation in 
relation to features of more aggressive tumors or prostate cancer recurrence 
have been completed.
METHODS: We used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to assess DNA 
methylation in tumor tissue from 407 patients with clinically localized prostate 
cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. Recurrence status was determined by 
follow-up patient surveys, medical record review, and linkage with the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. The methylation 
status of 14 genes for which promoter hypermethylation was previously correlated 
with advanced disease or biochemical recurrence was evaluated. Average 
methylation level for promoter region CpGs in patients who recurred compared 
with those with no evidence of recurrence was analyzed. For two genes with 
differential methylation, time to recurrence was examined.
RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 11.7 years, 104 (26%) patients recurred. 
Significant promoter hypermethylation in at least 50% of CpG sites in two genes, 
ABHD9 and HOXD3, was found in tumors from patients who recurred compared with 
those without recurrence. Evidence was strongest for HOXD3 (lowest P = 9.46 × 
10(-6)), with higher average methylation across promoter region CpGs associated 
with reduced recurrence-free survival (P = 2 × 10(-4)). DNA methylation profiles 
did not differ by recurrence status for the other genes.
CONCLUSIONS: These results validate the association between promoter 
hypermethylation of ADHB9 and HOXD3 and prostate cancer recurrence.
IMPACT: Tumor DNA methylation profiling may help to distinguish patients with 
prostate cancer at higher risk for disease recurrence.
