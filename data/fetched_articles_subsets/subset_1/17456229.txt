BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has neurotrophic activity 
which is mediated by its main agonist receptor, VEGFR2. Dysregulation of VEGF 
causes motor neurone degeneration in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), and expression of VEGFR2 is reduced in motor neurones and 
spinal cord of patients with ALS.
METHODS: We have screened the promoter region and 4 exonic regions of functional 
significance of the VEGFR2 gene in a UK population of patients with ALS, for 
mutations and polymorphisms that may affect expression or function of this VEGF 
receptor.
RESULTS: No mutations were identified in the VEGFR2 gene. We found no 
association between polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the VEGFR2 gene 
and ALS.
CONCLUSION: Mechanisms other than genetic variation may downregulate expression 
or function of the VEGFR2 receptor in patients with ALS.
