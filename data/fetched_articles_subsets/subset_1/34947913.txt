OBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their target microRNAs were 
documented in multiple studies to have a significant role in different joint 
disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). The current 
work aimed to determine the potential role of lnc-PVT1 and miR-146a as promising 
biomarkers to distinguish between RA, OA patients, and healthy individuals.
METHODS: The expression levels of lnc-PVT1 and its target miR-146a in the serum 
were measured for three different groups, including patients with RA (40), OA 
patients (40), and healthy controls (HCs) (40). Participating individuals were 
subjected to a full history investigation and clinical examination. Blood 
samples were tested for ESR, RF, CBC, as well as liver and renal functions. 
Serum was used to detect the relative expression levels of lnc-PVT1 and miR-146a 
and we correlated the levels with RA and OA activity and severity signs.
RESULTS: Lnc-PVT1 expression level was greater among patients with RA compared 
to that of OA patients, with a fold change median of 2.62 and 0.22, respectively 
(p = 0.001). The miR-146a fold change was significantly demonstrated between the 
RA, OA, and HCs groups. There was no correlation between both biomarkers with 
the disease activity scales (DAS28) of RA, the Knee injury Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (KOOS), or any sign of detection of the disease severity of OA.
CONCLUSIONS: lnc-PVT1 and miR-146a could be considered as promising biomarkers 
for the diagnosis of RA and OA and may have an important role as therapeutic 
targets in the future.
