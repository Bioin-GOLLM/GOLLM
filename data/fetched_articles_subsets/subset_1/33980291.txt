Serotonergic gene-to-gene interaction is associated with mood and GABA 
concentrations but not with pain-related cerebral processing in fibromyalgia 
subjects and healthy controls.

The neurotransmitter serotonin, involved in the regulation of pain and emotion, 
is critically regulated by the 5-HT1A autoreceptor and the serotonin transporter 
(5-HTT). Polymorphisms of these genes affect mood and endogenous pain 
modulation, both demonstrated to be altered in fibromyalgia subjects (FMS). 
Here, we tested the effects of genetic variants of the 5-HT1A receptor 
(CC/G-carriers) and 5-HTT (high/intermediate/low expression) on mood, pain 
sensitivity, cerebral processing of evoked pain (functional MRI) and 
concentrations of GABA and glutamate (MR spectroscopy) in rostral anterior 
cingulate cortex (rACC) and thalamus in FMS and healthy controls (HC). 
Interactions between serotonin-relevant genes were found in affective 
characteristics, with genetically inferred high serotonergic signalling (5-HT1A 
CC/5-HTThigh genotypes) being more favourable across groups. Additionally, 
5-HT1A CC homozygotes displayed higher pain thresholds than G-carriers in HC but 
not in FMS. Cerebral processing of evoked pressure pain differed between groups 
in thalamus with HC showing more deactivation than FMS, but was not influenced 
by serotonin-relevant genotypes. In thalamus, we observed a 5-HT1A-by-5-HTT and 
group-by-5-HTT interaction in GABA concentrations, with the 5-HTT high 
expressing genotype differing between groups and 5-HT1A genotypes. No 
significant effects were seen for glutamate or in rACC. To our knowledge, this 
is the first report of this serotonergic gene-to-gene interaction associated 
with mood, both among FMS (depression) and across groups (anxiety). 
Additionally, our findings provide evidence of an association between the 
serotonergic system and thalamic GABA concentrations, with individuals 
possessing genetically inferred high serotonergic signalling exhibiting the 
highest GABA concentrations, possibly enhancing GABAergic inhibitory effects via 
5-HT.
