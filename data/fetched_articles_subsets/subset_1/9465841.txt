INTRODUCTION: Sirolimus and cyclosporine (INN, ciclosporin) share the same 
cytochrome P4503A metabolic pathways, and both drugs are substrates for 
p-glycoprotein countertransport. These factors most likely affect the 
bioavailability of both drugs. This study served to examine whether the timing 
of the administration of cyclosporine and sirolimus might significantly affect 
the relative bioavailability of one or both of these drugs.
METHODS: In this randomized crossover trial, 24 stable kidney transplant 
recipients who were treated after transplant with a combination of sirolimus, 
cyclosporine, and prednisone for at least 3 months before study initiation, 
received individualized doses of sirolimus once daily and cyclosporine in the 
microemulsion formulation twice a day. A total of 20 patients completed the full 
crossover design. Patients were randomized to one of two dosing schedules: 10 of 
the patients who completed the study received the morning doses of sirolimus and 
cyclosporine concomitantly for the first 7 days (schedule I), and from days 8 to 
14 the sirolimus dose was administered 4 hours after the morning cyclosporine 
dose. Ten of the patients received the sirolimus dose 4 hours after the morning 
cyclosporine dose for the first 7 days (schedule II), and from days 8 to 14 they 
received concomitant morning doses of cyclosporine and sirolimus. 
Pharmacokinetic profiles of sirolimus and cyclosporine performed on all patients 
on days 7, 14, and 15 yielded the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), 
peak concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), trough cyclosporine 
concentration (Co), and trough sirolimus concentration (Co) values.
RESULTS: Sirolimus AUC and sirolimus trough levels were consistently and 
significantly higher when both cyclosporine and sirolimus were administered 
concomitantly than when they were administered 4 hours apart. No effect 
attributable to timing of drug administration could be found on cyclosporine 
pharmacokinetic parameters.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that the relative timing of administration of 
cyclosporine and sirolimus significantly affects the blood concentrations of 
sirolimus.
