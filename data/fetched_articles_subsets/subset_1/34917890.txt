Programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) exerts critical functions as tumor 
suppressor and in immune cells to regulate inflammatory processes. The 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) promotes degradation of PDCD4 via mammalian 
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). However, additional pathways that may 
regulate PDCD4 expression are largely ill-defined. In this study, we have found 
that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 promoted degradation 
of PDCD4 in macrophages and fibroblasts. Mechanistically, we identified a 
pathway from p38 and its substrate MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) 
to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) to regulate mTORC1-dependent degradation 
of PDCD4. Moreover, we provide evidence that TSC1 and TSC2 regulate PDCD4 
expression via an additional mechanism independent of mTORC1. These novel data 
extend our knowledge of how PDCD4 expression is regulated by stress- and 
nutrient-sensing pathways.
