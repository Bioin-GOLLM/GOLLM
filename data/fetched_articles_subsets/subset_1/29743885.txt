DAB2IP (DOC2/DAB2 interactive protein) is downregulated in several cancer types, 
and its downregulation is involved in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, 
metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We aimed to investigate 
the potential role of DAB2IP in the development and progression of gastric 
cancer. DAB2IP levels were analyzed in human gastric cancer and adjacent normal 
tissues by Western blots and immunohistochemistry. Potential roles of DAB2IP in 
regulating gastric cancer cell growth and metastasis were examined by genetic 
manipulation in vitro. The molecular signaling was determined to understand the 
mechanisms of observed DAB2IP effects. DAB2IP level is lower in gastric cancer 
tissues as compared to paired normal tissues. Knockdown of DAB2IP enhanced 
gastric cancer cell growth and metastasis in vitro and promoted EMT progress at 
both protein and mRNA levels. Silencing DAB2IP activated extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway, and the enhanced proliferation and 
migration ability induced by DAB2IP knockdown were reduced after incubation with 
U0126 in SGC7901 gastric cancer cells. Inhibition of DAB2IP enhances gastric 
cancer cell growth and metastasis through targeting the ERK1/2 signaling, 
indicating that it may serve as a potential target for treatment of gastric 
cancer.
