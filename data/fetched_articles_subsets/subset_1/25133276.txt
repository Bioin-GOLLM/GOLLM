Evaluation and mitigation of the risk of immunogenicity to protein aggregates 
and particles in therapeutic protein products remains a primary concern for drug 
developers and regulatory agencies. To investigate how the presence of protein 
particles and the route of administration influence the immunogenicity of a 
model therapeutic protein, we measured the immune response in mice to injections 
of formulations of recombinant murine growth hormone (rmGH) that contained 
controlled levels of protein particles. Mice were injected twice over 6 weeks 
with rmGH formulations via the subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intravenous 
(i.v.) routes. In addition to soluble, monomeric rmGH, the samples prepared 
contained either nanoparticles of rmGH or both nano- and microparticles of 
rmGH.The appearance of anti-rmGH IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3 titers 
following the second injection of both preparations implies that multiple 
mechanisms contributed to the immune response. No dependence of the immune 
response on particle size and distribution was observed. The immune response 
measured after the second injection was most pronounced when i.v. administration 
was used. Despite producing high anti-rmGH titers mice appeared to retain the 
ability to properly regulate and use endogenous growth hormone.
