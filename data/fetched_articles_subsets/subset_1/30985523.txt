Varekova, R, Botek, M, Petrek, M, Lenka, K, and Cięszczyk, P. Effect of COL5A1, 
GDF5, and PPARA genes on a movement screen and neuromuscular performance in 
adolescent team sport athletes. J Strength Cond Res 33(8): 2057-2065, 2019-The 
risk of injury increases with adolescents' chronological age and may be related 
to limited muscle function neuromuscular, genetic, and biomechanical factors. 
The purpose of this study was to determine whether COL5A1, PPARA, and GDF5 genes 
are associated with muscle functions and stretch-shortening cycle performance in 
adolescent athletes. One hundred forty-six youth players (14.4 ± 0.2 years) from 
various team sports (basketball n = 54, soccer n = 50, handball n = 32) 
underwent a manual test for muscle function, maturity estimation, functional 
bend test (FBT), passive straight leg raise (SLR) test, leg stiffness test, test 
of reactive strength index (RSI), and gene sampling for COL5A1, PPARA, and GDF5. 
The χ test did not show any differences in allele or genotype frequency between 
participants before and after peak height velocity. Multivariate analysis of 
variance showed that COL5A1 rs12722 CT heterozygotes had worse score in FBT (p < 
0.001), worse score in SLR (p = 0.003), and lower maturity offset (p = 0.029, 
only in females) than TT homozygotes. Male GDF5 rs143383 GG homozygotes showed 
better score in SLR than AA and AG genotypes (p = 0.003), and AA and AG 
genotypes in both sex had greater RSI than GG homozygotes (p = 0.016). The PPARA 
rs4253778 CC homozygotes had greater RSI than GG and GC genotypes (p = 0.004). 
The CT genotype in COL5A1 rs12722 is possible predictor of functional movement 
disruption in the posterior hip muscle chain, causing shortening in FBT and SLR, 
which includes hamstrings function. CT genotype in COL5A1 rs12722 should be 
involved in programs targeting hamstring and posterior hip muscle chain.
