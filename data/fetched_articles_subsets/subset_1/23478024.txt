Synaptic activity triggers a profound reorganization of the molecular 
composition of excitatory synapses. For example, NMDA receptors are removed from 
synapses in an activity- and calcium-dependent manner, via casein kinase 2 (CK2) 
phosphorylation of the PDZ ligand of the GluN2B subunit (S1480). However, how 
synaptic activity drives this process remains unclear because CK2 is a 
constitutively active kinase, which is not directly regulated by calcium. We 
show here that activated CaMKII couples GluN2B and CK2 to form a trimolecular 
complex and increases CK2-mediated phosphorylation of GluN2B S1480. In addition, 
a GluN2B mutant, which contains an insert to mimic the GluN2A sequence and 
cannot bind to CaMKII, displays reduced S1480 phosphorylation and increased 
surface expression. We find that although disrupting GluN2B/CaMKII binding 
reduces synapse number, it increases synaptic-GluN2B content. Therefore, the 
GluN2B/CaMKII association controls synapse density and PSD composition in an 
activity-dependent manner, including recruitment of CK2 for the removal of 
GluN2B from synapses.
