Multidisciplinary research efforts on potential COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic 
candidates have increased since the pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. 
This search has become imperative due to the increasing emergences and limited 
widely available medicines. The presence of bioactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 molecules 
was examined from various plant sources. Among them is a group of proteins 
called lectins that can bind carbohydrate moieties. In this article, we present 
ten novel, chitin-specific Hevein-like lectins that were derived from 
Selaginella moellendorffii v1.0's genome. The capacity of these lectin homologs 
to bind with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was examined. Using the HDOCK 
server, 3D-modeled Hevein-domains were docked to the spike protein's receptor 
binding domain (RBD). The Smo446851, Smo125663, and Smo99732 interacted with 
Asn343-located complex N-glycan and RBD residues, respectively, with binding 
free energies of -17.5, -13.0, and -26.5 Kcal/mol. The molecular dynamics 
simulation using Desmond and the normal-state analyses via torsional coordinate 
association for the Smo99732-RBD complex using iMODS is characterized by overall 
higher stability and minimum deformity than the other lectin complexes. The 
three lectins interacting with carbohydrates were docked against five individual 
mutations that frequently occur in major SARS-CoV-2 variants. These were in the 
spike protein's receptor-binding motif (RBM), while Smo125663 and Smo99732 only 
interacted with the spike glycoprotein in a protein-protein manner. The 
precursors for the Hevein-like homologs underwent additional characterization, 
and their expressional profile in different tissues was studied. These in silico 
findings offered potential lectin candidates targeting key N-glycan sites 
crucial to the virus's virulence and infection.
