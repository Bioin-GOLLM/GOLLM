BACKGROUND: Inflammations play crucial role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's 
disease (PD), however, their possible value in the diagnosis or tracking of the 
progress of PD is still limited, because of discordant results in the literature 
and a lack of information regarding its reproducibility. Thus, overall 
longitudinal and cross-sectional studies are needed. This multicentre study was 
designed to investigate the association between multiple peripheral immune 
biomarkers and the development and progression of PD.
METHODS: This was a longitudinal and multicentre study. First, we measured the 
levels of five typical cytokines and five focused chemokines in 76 PD patients 
and 76 healthy controls (HCs) in a discovery cohort. Then, a validation cohort 
of 80 PD and 80 HC participants was recruited from four multicentre locations. 
In addition, a prospective follow-up of early-stage PD patients was performed 
with significant biomarkers. Finally, we performed further verification in an 
exploratory set of patients with idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder (iRBD).
RESULTS: In the discovery set, CXCL12, CX3CL1 and IL-8 levels were significantly 
higher in PD patients than in HCs (p < 0.05). The receiver-operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve for a combination of these three biomarkers produced 
a high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (p < 0.001). Moreover, four biomarkers 
(the previous three and CCL15) were significantly associated with PD in the 
discovery and validation cohorts. Furthermore, in the prospective follow-up 
cohort, CX3CL1 levels were associated with motor progression after a mean 
interval of 43 months. In addition, CX3CL1 and IL-8 levels were higher in iRBD 
patients than in HCs.
CONCLUSION: We showed a correlation between a profile of four peripheral immune 
biomarkers and PD development and progression. Our findings may provide a basis 
whereby PD patients with abnormal inflammatory profiles can be identified and 
receive timely therapeutic interventions.
