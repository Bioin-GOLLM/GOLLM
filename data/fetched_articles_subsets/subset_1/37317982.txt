Herbivorous insects are exceptionally diverse, accounting for a quarter of all 
known eukaryotic species, but the genomic basis of adaptations that enabled this 
dietary transition remains poorly understood. Many studies have suggested that 
expansions and contractions of chemosensory and detoxification gene 
families-genes directly mediating interactions with plant chemical 
defenses-underlie successful plant colonization. However, this hypothesis has 
been challenging to test because the origins of herbivory in many insect 
lineages are ancient (>150 million years ago (mya)), obscuring genomic 
evolutionary patterns. Here, we characterized chemosensory and detoxification 
gene family evolution across Scaptomyza, a genus nested within Drosophila that 
includes a recently derived (<15 mya) herbivore lineage of mustard (Brassicales) 
specialists and carnation (Caryophyllaceae) specialists, and several 
nonherbivorous species. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that herbivorous 
Scaptomyza has among the smallest chemosensory and detoxification gene 
repertoires across 12 drosophilid species surveyed. Rates of gene turnover 
averaged across the herbivore clade were significantly higher than background 
rates in over half of the surveyed gene families. However, gene turnover was 
more limited along the ancestral herbivore branch, with only gustatory receptors 
and odorant-binding proteins experiencing strong losses. The genes most 
significantly impacted by gene loss, duplication, or changes in selective 
constraint were those involved in detecting compounds associated with feeding on 
living plants (bitter or electrophilic phytotoxins) or their ancestral diet 
(fermenting plant volatiles). These results provide insight into the molecular 
and evolutionary mechanisms of plant-feeding adaptations and highlight gene 
candidates that have also been linked to other dietary transitions in 
Drosophila.
