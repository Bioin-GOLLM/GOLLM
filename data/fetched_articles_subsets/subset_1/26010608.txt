CD44 as one of the most putative stem cell markers plays a key role in many 
cellular processes, including cancer cell growth and migration. Functional 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CD44 may modulate its gene functions 
and thus cancer risk. In the current study, we investigated if polymorphisms in 
the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of CD44 are associated with increased 
susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC) by conducting a case-control study of 
946 CRC patients and 989 cancer-free controls. Three polymorphisms (rs13347C/T, 
rs10836347C/T, rs11821102G/A) in the 3'-UTR of CD44 were genotyped. We found 
that the variant genotypes (CT and TT) of rs13347 (adjusted odds ratio 
(OR)=1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.50-2.17) increased an individual's 
susceptibility to CRC, compared with rs13347CC homozygous genotypes. We also 
found that CRC patients with the CT/TT genotype had a 1.6-fold increased risk 
for developing advanced (stage III + IV) CRC. Furthermore, functional assays 
showed that the C to T base change at rs13347C/T disrupts the binding site for 
the microRNA hsa-mir-509-3p, thereby increasing CD44 transcriptional activity 
and expression level. These findings suggest that the rs13347C/T in microRNA 
binding site may be potential biomarkers for genetic susceptibility to CRC.
