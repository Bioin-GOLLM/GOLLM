The gp120 surface subunit of HIV-1 envelope lycoprotein (Env) is the key 
component for the viral entry process through interaction with the CD4 binding 
site (CD4bs) of the primary receptor CD4. The point mutant was introduced into 
SD1, a CD4 D1 variant, to enhance the interaction with HIV-1 gp120.The 
three-dimensional structures of gp120 and SD1 were determined using homology 
modeling based on the results previously determined by X-ray crystallography. 
The binding models were carried out via protein-protein docking tools. The 5 
best docking solutions were retained according to the docking scores and were 
used for structural assessment. Our results demonstrated the consistency between 
the 3D models of gp120 and SD1 predicted by molecular docking calculations and 
the co-crystallized data available. We first discovered that most residues in 
SD1 that interacted with gp120 were located within the region 6-94 of the first 
N-terminal D1 domain of CD4. SD1 bound to gp120 stably at which 15 residues 
formed 20 hydrogen bonds with 16 residues of gp120. Five pairs of electrostatic 
interactions between positively and negatively charged side chains of amino 
acids were identified in the SD1-gp120 interface, which showed an increased 
number of electrostatic interactions with gp120. The mutant in the D1 domain of 
human CD4 receptor could strengthen binding affinity with HIV-1 gp120 and might 
improve the interaction pattern of the neighboring residues. The sequence 
analysis of gp120 suggested that Asp186, Asn189, Arg191, Glu293, Phe318 and 
Tyr319 were located in the variable regions of gp120, which may be HIV-1 AE 
strain-specific amino acid residues. Together, the results presented in this 
study contributed to a better understanding of the changes in the interaction 
between the gp120 protein and the human host CD4 receptor associated with point 
mutation in the D1 domain. The stabilized derivative of human CD4 D1 should 
serve as a promising target for therapeutics development in HIV-1 vaccine and 
viral entry inhibitor and may warrant further investigation.
