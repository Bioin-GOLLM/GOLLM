Cell membrane translocation of heat shock protein gp96 from the endoplasmic 
reticulum has been observed in multiple tumors and is associated with tumor 
malignancy. However, the cancer-intrinsic function and the related mechanism of 
cell membrane gp96 as a pro-oncogenic chaperone remain further elucidated. In 
this study, we found that inhibition of gp96 intramolecular conformational 
changes by a single α-helix peptide p37 dramatically increased its binding to 
HER2, whereas decreased HER2 dimerization, phosphorylation and downstream 
signaling. Targeting cell membrane gp96 promoted HER2 ubiquitination and 
subsequent lysosomal degradation, which led to decreased cell growth and 
increased apoptosis, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. We also demonstrate 
that gp96 inhibitory peptide p37 synergized with trastuzumab to suppress cell 
growth and induce apoptosis. Our work demonstrates that blocking gp96 
conformational changes directs HER2 for cellular degradation, and represents a 
new therapeutic strategy for inhibiting HER2 signaling in cancer.
