BACKGROUND: Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) still represents a crucial concern in 
solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) and the use of antiviral therapy are 
limited by side effects and the selection of viral mutations conferring 
antiviral drug resistance.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we reported the case of an HCMV seronegative patient 
with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), multiple hepatic adenomatosis, 
hepatopulmonary syndrome and portal hypertension who received a liver transplant 
from an HCMV seropositive donor. The patient was treated with Valganciclovir 
(vGCV) and then IV Ganciclovir (GCV) at 5 week post-transplant for uncontrolled 
HCMV DNAemia. However, since mutation A594V in UL97 gene conferring resistance 
to ganciclovir was reported, GCV therapy was interrupted. Due to the high 
toxicity of Foscarnet (FOS) and Cidofovir (CDV), Letermovir (LMV) monotherapy at 
the dosage of 480 mg per day was administered, with a gradual viral load 
reduction. However, a relapse of HCMV DNAemia revealed the presence of mutation 
C325Y in HCMV UL56 gene conferring resistance to LMV.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, even if LMV is an effective and favorable safety 
molecule it might have a lower genetic barrier to resistance. A warning on the 
use of LMV monotherapy as rescue treatments for HCMV GCV-resistant infections in 
transplant recipients is warranted.
