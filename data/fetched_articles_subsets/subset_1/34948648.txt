BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis (OP) is a common orthopedic disease in the elderly, and 
Adiponectin (ADIPOQ) is closely related to bone metabolism.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between five single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) loci in the ADIPOQ gene and osteoporosis in middle-aged and 
elderly Mulam subjects in Hechi, Guangxi.
METHODS: This case-control study included 297 middle-aged and elderly Mulam 
subjects with normal bone mass, 49 subjects with reduced bone mass, and 38 
subjects with osteoporosis. Five loci (rs266729, rs1063539, rs2241766, 
rs3774261, rs710445) of the ADIPOQ in the Mulam subjects were genotyped using 
SNP with multiple-base extension.
RESULTS: The bone strength index (SI) of middle-aged and elderly Mulam subjects 
showed an overall decreasing trend when the subjects were older. Age, muscle 
mass, and subcutaneous fat content were the main factors influencing the SI in 
Mulam subjects. The GC genotype of rs266729 and the GA and GG genotypes of 
rs710445 were significantly correlated with risk of bone loss (p < 0.05). 
rs2241766 and rs1063539 showed strong LD (D' > 0.8, r2 > 0.33). rs710445 and 
rs266729 loci and rs3774261 and rs2241766 loci showed complete LD (D' = 1).
CONCLUSIONS: The GC genotype at rs266729 of the ADIPOQ gene, the GA and GG 
genotypes at rs710445, and the haplotypes CCGAA and GGTAG correlated with 
osteoporosis (p < 0.05). The allele C of rs1063539, rs266729 and rs710445 may 
afford protection for osteoporosis. The allele G may be the genetic 
susceptibility gene for osteoporosis, increasing the risk of osteoporosis.
