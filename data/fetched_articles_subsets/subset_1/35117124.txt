Malignant melanoma of the breast (MMB) is a rare disease that accounts for 3-5% 
of all melanomas. It can be expressed as a metastatic mammary gland or primary 
mammary melanin of the mammary gland. Primary MMB (PMMB) can be divided into two 
types: parenchymal melanoma without skin involvement and melanoma involving skin 
on the breast. The diagnosis of PMMB relies mainly on histopathological 
diagnosis. In this diagnostic approach, S100 and HMB45 have a higher specificity 
in the diagnosis of melanoma immunohistochemistry. At the same time, mutations 
in the BRAF (V600E) gene have further aided the diagnosis of PMMB. After the 
diagnosis, the main treatment is mainly based on surgery. The main surgical 
methods include breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy. With advances in 
technology and surgical skills, the combination of patient aesthetic 
satisfaction and tumor safety is the goal of modern breast surgeons. This 
article reviews the current status of PMMB surgical treatment.
