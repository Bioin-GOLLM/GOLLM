The asymmetric unit of the title compound, C(19)H(12)O(5), contains two 
independent mol-ecules, both slightly buckled along an axis passing through the 
C=O bonds of the anthraquinone ring system (r.m.s. deviation of non-H atoms = 
0.082 and 0.148 Å): the benzene rings are twisted to each other by 4.3 (3)°in 
one mol-ecule and 10.6(3)° in the other. In both mol-ecules, the hy-droxy group 
forms an intra-molecular O-H⋯O hydrogen bond. The two independent mol-ecules 
inter-act by π-π stacking with a centroid-centroid distance of 3.539 (2) Å 
between hy-droxy-benzene rings of adjacent mol-ecules.
