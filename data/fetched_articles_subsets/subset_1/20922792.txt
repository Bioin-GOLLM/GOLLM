Activating mutations in FGFR3 cause the most common forms of human dwarfism: 
achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia. In mouse models of achondroplasia, 
recent studies have implicated the ERK MAPK pathway, a pathway activated by 
FGFR3, in creating reduced bone growth. Our recent studies have indicated that 
increased Fgfr3 and ERK MAPK signaling in chondrocytes also causes premature 
synchondrosis closure in the cranial base and vertebrae, accounting for the 
sometimes fatal stenosis of the foramen magnum and spinal canal in 
achondroplasia. Conversely, whether the decrease--or inactivation--of ERK1 and 
ERK2 promotes bone growth and delays synchondrosis closure remains to be 
investigated. In this study, we inactivated ERK2 in the chondrocytes of 
ERK1-null mice using the Col2a1-Cre and Col2a1-CreER transgenes. We found that 
the genetic inactivation of ERK1 and ERK2 in chondrocytes enhances the growth of 
cartilaginous skeletal elements. We also found that the postnatal inactivation 
of ERK1 and ERK2 in chondrocytes delays synchondrosis closure and enlarges the 
spinal canal. These observations make ERK1 and ERK2 an attractive target for the 
treatment of achondroplasia and other FGFR3-related skeletal syndromes.
