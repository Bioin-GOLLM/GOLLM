PURPOSE: To determine the effects of corneal epithelial membrane-type 1 matrix 
metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) on vascular endothelial migration and proliferation.
METHODS: We generated immortalized wild-type, MT1-MMP knockout and MT1-MMP 
knock-in corneal epithelial cells. Calf pulmonary arterial endothelial (CPAE) 
cell proliferation and Boyden chamber migration were assayed.
RESULTS: Conditioned media from MT1-MMP epithelial knockout cells significantly 
increased CPAE proliferation 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation, and 
CPAE migration as compared with wild-type epithelial cells. Conditioned media 
from knock-in cells reversed the increase in CPAE proliferation, BrdU 
incorporation and CPAE migration. Knock-in cells transfected with mutant MT1-MMP 
(E240A) did not abrogate the reversal effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Corneal epithelial MT1-MMP is antiangiogenic. This antiangiogenic 
activity does not require the catalytic domain.
