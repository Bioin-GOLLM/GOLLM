Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a vascular malformation characterized 
by clustered enlarged capillary-like channels in the central nervous system. The 
genes harboring variants in patients with CCM include CCM1/Krev interaction 
trapped-1, CCM2/MGC4607, and CCM3/programmed cell death protein 10. We aimed to 
identify pathogenic variants in an ethnic Chinese population in Taiwan. We 
recruited 95 patients with multiple CCMs or a single lesion with a relevant 
family history. Sanger sequencing was performed for 41 patients. Variants were 
identified using sequence alignment tools, and the clinical significance of 
these variants was determined using American College of Medical Genetics and 
Genomics standards and guidelines. Several pathogenic variants were found in six 
patients, including three unrelated patients and three affected members of one 
family. Two novel pathogenic variants leading to early truncation comprised a 
deletion variant in exon 18 of CCM1 (c.1846delA; p.Glu617LysfsTer44) and an 
insertion variant in exon 4 of CCM2 (c.401_402insGCCC; p.Ile136AlafsTer4). One 
novel pathogenic splice site variant was c.485 + 1G > C at the beginning of 
intron 8 of CCM1. In this study, we identified novel variants related to CCM in 
an ethnically Chinese population in Taiwan.
