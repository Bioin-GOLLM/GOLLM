Smoking, inflammation and depression commonly co-occur and may be 
mechanistically linked. However, key questions remain around the direction of 
association and the influence of residual confounding. We aimed to characterize 
the association between lifetime smoking and depression, as well as to assess 
the role that genetically-predicted C-reactive protein (CRP) level, (an 
archetypal generalized inflammatory marker) and/or IL-6 activity, as a potential 
explanation for this association. We performed inverse variance weighted 
Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using recently published summary-level 
GWAS data for lifetime smoking index, CRP levels, and depression. A subset of 
inflammatory-related genetic variants from the lifetime smoking GWAS were also 
used to assess the potential inflammatory causal pathways between smoking and 
depression. The analysis indicated reciprocal relationships of lifetime smoking 
with depression (ORSmk-Dep = 2.01, 95% CI 1.71-2.37, p < 0.001; 
ORDep-Smk = 1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.13, p < 0.001), CRP levels and IL-6 activity 
(ORSmk-CRP = 1.40, 95% CI 1.21-1.55, p < 0.001; ORCRP-Smk = 1.03, 95% CI 
1.02-1.05, p < 0.001, ORIL-6/CRP-Smk = 1.06 (1.03-1.09), p < 0.001). These 
associations were also supported by the majority of the robust MR methods 
performed. We did not find evidence for a reciprocal relationship between CRP 
levels (using > 500 genetic instruments for CRP) and depression 
(ORCRP-Dep = 1.01, 95% CI 0.99-1.04; ORDep-CRP = 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.07). We 
observed little variation in the IVW estimates between smoking and depression 
when we limited the genetic variants assessed to those related to measures of 
generalized inflammation, but we found evidence for an attenuation of the 
smoking-depression association in multivariable mendelian randomization when 
adjusting for IL-6 activity, suggesting that the IL-6 pathway may be at least in 
part responsible for the association of smoking and depression. Our study 
supports potential bidirectional causal associations between lifetime smoking 
and depression which may be at least in part explained by the IL-6 signalling 
pathway. The IL-6 pathway may represent a putative therapeutic target for 
smoking and to mitigate the effects of smoking on depression.
