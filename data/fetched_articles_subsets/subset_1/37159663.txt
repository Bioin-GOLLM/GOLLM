Although the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) 
into various types of blood cells has been well established, approaches for 
clinical-scale production of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) 
remain challenging. We found that hiPSCs cocultured with stromal cells as 
spheroids (hematopoietic spheroids [Hp-spheroids]) can grow in a stirred 
bioreactor and develop into yolk sac-like organoids without the addition of 
exogenous factors. Hp-spheroid-induced organoids recapitulated a yolk 
sac-characteristic cellular complement and structures as well as the functional 
ability to generate HPCs with lympho-myeloid potential. Moreover, sequential 
hemato-vascular ontogenesis could also be observed during organoid formation. We 
demonstrated that organoid-induced HPCs can be differentiated into erythroid 
cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes with current maturation protocols. 
Notably, the Hp-spheroid system can be performed in an autologous and xeno-free 
manner, thereby improving the feasibility of bulk production of hiPSC-derived 
HPCs in clinical, therapeutic contexts.
