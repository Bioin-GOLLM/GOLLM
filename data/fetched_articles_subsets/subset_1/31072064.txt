Safranal, the main volatile chemical of Saffron (Crocus sativus) was studied to 
estimate its allelopathic effects on the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll, 
leaf electrolyte leakage, fresh weight, catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POX) 
activity of the test plant Lettuce (Lactuca sativa). In this study, the 
effective concentration (EC50) of safranal on CAT was estimated to be 6.12 
µg/cm3. CAT activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the increase in 
the safranal concentration while POX activity was increased. Moreover, Safranal 
caused significant physiological changes in chlorophyll content, leaf 
electrolyte leakage, and fresh weight of several weed species with Lolium 
multiflorum being the most sensitive. Furthermore, 5 µM Safranal showed 
significant inhibitory activity against dicotyledonous in comparison to the 
monocotyledons under greenhouse conditions. The inhibition of the CAT by 
safranal was similar to those of uncompetitive inhibitors, and therefore the 
decline in carbon fixation by plants might be the mechanism behind the 
inhibitory activity of safranal.
