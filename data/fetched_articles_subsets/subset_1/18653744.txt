The abilities of 7-coumarin propargyl ether (CPE) and 
7-(4-trifluoromethyl)coumarin propargyl ether (TFCPE) to act as mechanism-based 
inactivators of P450 3A4 and 3A5 in the reconstituted system have been 
investigated using 7-benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin (BFC) and 
testosterone as probes. CPE inhibited the BFC O-debenzylation activity of P450 
3A4 in a time-, concentration-, and NADPH-dependent manner characteristic of a 
mechanism-based inactivator with a half-maximal inactivation (K(I)) of 112 
microM, a maximal rate of inactivation (k(inact)) of 0.05 min(-1), and a t(1/2) 
of 13.9 min. Similarly, TFCPE inhibited the BFC O-debenzylation activity of P450 
3A4 in a time-, concentration-, and NADPH-dependent manner with a K(I) of 14 
microM, a k(inact) of 0.04 min(-1), and a t(1/2) of 16.5 min. Parallel losses of 
P450 3A4 enzymatic activity and heme were observed with both compounds as 
measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and reduced CO spectra. 
Interestingly, neither compound inhibited the BFC O-debenzylation activity of 
P450 3A5. Reactive intermediates of CPE and TFCPE formed by P450 3A4 were 
trapped with glutathione, and the resulting adducts were identified using tandem 
mass spectral analysis. Metabolism studies using TFCPE resulted in the 
identification of a single metabolite that is formed by P450 3A4 but not by P450 
3A5 and that may play a role in the mechanism-based inactivation.
