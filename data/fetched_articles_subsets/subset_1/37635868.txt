In mammals, spatial orientation is synaptically-encoded by sensory hair cells of 
the vestibular labyrinth. Vestibular hair cells (VHCs) harbor synaptic ribbons 
at their presynaptic active zones (AZs), which play a critical role in molecular 
scaffolding and facilitate synaptic release and vesicular replenishment. With 
advancing age, the prevalence of vestibular deficits increases; yet, the 
underlying mechanisms are not well understood and the possible accompanying 
morphological changes in the VHC synapses have not yet been systematically 
examined. We investigated the effects of maturation and aging on the 
ultrastructure of the ribbon-type AZs in murine utricles using various electron 
microscopic techniques and combined them with confocal and super-resolution 
light microscopy as well as metabolic imaging up to 1 year of age. In older 
animals, we detected predominantly in type I VHCs the formation of floating 
ribbon clusters, mostly consisting of newly synthesized ribbon material. Our 
findings suggest that VHC ribbon-type AZs undergo dramatic structural 
alterations upon aging.
