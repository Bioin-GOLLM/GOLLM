Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) mutations are the most frequent 
aetiologies of congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (CLAH). Phenotypes may 
vary, and puberty may be absent in affected individuals. To date, only two 
pregnancies have been described in 46,XX CLAH patients with StAR mutations; 
these patients exhibited ovarian steroidogenesis along with spontaneous puberty 
and menarche and normal menses. The patient described here presented with CLAH 
caused by the homozygous (unreported, 1 bp) deletion c.719del in the StAR gene, 
which was diagnosed after acute adrenal insufficiency when the patient was 10 
days old. The patient did not undergo spontaneous puberty, so puberty was 
induced by HRT when the patient was 13 years old. At the age of 25 years, the 
patient was referred to our reproductive unit because she desired to conceive. 
An initial cycle of clomiphene, stimulation produced follicular growth with two 
mature follicles measuring 18 and 15 mm, respectively, but the plasma oestradiol 
levels remained low (18 pg/ml) and the endometrium was thin (3 mm). Pregnancy 
was finally achieved after ovarian stimulation, IVF and transfer of 
frozen-thawed embryos after endometrial preparation with HRT. A normal female 
child was delivered following a 40 weeks' uneventful pregnancy. We therefore 
report the first IVF pregnancy achieved in a 46,XX CLAH patient homozygous for a 
StAR mutation, with inadequate ovarian steroidogenesis and no spontaneous 
puberty.
