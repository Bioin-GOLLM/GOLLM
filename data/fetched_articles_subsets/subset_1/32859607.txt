OBJECTIVE: The aim of this trial was to compare the efficacy of real-time and 
intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM and isCGM, 
respectively) in maintaining optimal glycemic control.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized study, adults with type 1 
diabetes (T1D) and normal hypoglycemia awareness (Gold score <4) used rtCGM 
(Guardian Connect Mobile) or isCGM (FreeStyle Libre) during 4 days of physical 
activity (exercise phase) and in the subsequent 4 weeks at home (home phase). 
Primary end points were time in hypoglycemia (<3.9 mmol/L [<70 mg/dL]) and time 
in range (3.9-10.0 mmol/L [70-180 mg/dL]). The isCGM group wore an additional 
masked Enlite sensor (iPro2) for 6 days to check for bias between the different 
sensors used by the rtCGM and isCGM systems.
RESULTS: Sixty adults with T1D (mean age 38 ± 13 years; A1C 62 ± 12 mmol/mol 
[7.8 ± 1.1%]) were randomized to rtCGM (n = 30) or isCGM (n = 30). All 
participants completed the study. Percentage of time in hypoglycemia (<3.9 
mmol/L [<70 mg/dL]) was lower among rtCGM versus isCGM participants in the 
exercise phase (6.8 ± 5.5% vs. 11.4 ± 8.6%, respectively; P = 0.018) and during 
the home phase (5.3 ± 2.5% vs. 7.3 ± 4.4%, respectively; P = 0.035). 
Hypoglycemia differences were significant and most notable during the night. 
rtCGM participants spent more time in range (3.9-10 mmol/L [70-180 mg/dL]) than 
isCGM participants throughout both the exercise (78.5 ± 10.2% vs. 69.7 ± 16%, 
respectively; P = 0.0149) and home (75.6 ± 9.7% vs. 67.4 ± 17.8%, respectively; 
P = 0.0339) phases. The results were robust to the insignificant bias between 
rtCGM and isCGM sensors that masked CGM found in the isCGM arm.
CONCLUSIONS: rtCGM was superior to isCGM in reducing hypoglycemia and improving 
time in range in adults with T1D with normal hypoglycemia awareness, 
demonstrating the value of rtCGM alarms during exercise and in daily diabetes 
self-management.
