Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at chromosome 4q25 (near PITX2) are 
strongly associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). We assessed whether a 
4q25-tagging SNP (rs2200733) is associated with PR interval duration in patients 
with lone and typical AF and controls. Patients with lone (n = 169) and typical 
(n = 269) AF enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF registry and controls (n = 1,403) 
derived from the Vanderbilt DNA Biobank were studied. Carriage of the rs2200733T 
allele (CT or TT genotype) was more common in patients with lone (39%) than 
typical (25%) AF or controls (21%, p <0.01 for both comparisons). In both AF 
cohorts, we observed an association between genotype and PR interval duration 
(median PR interval for CC, CT, and TT: 162, 178, and 176 ms, respectively, for 
lone, p = 0.038 and 166, 180, and 196 ms, respectively, for typical, p = 0.001). 
After adjustment for covariates, the association between T allele and PR 
prolongation persisted, with mean effect size of 10.9, 12.8, and 4.4 ms for 
patients with lone and typical AF and controls, respectively (p <0.05 for each 
comparison). We found that a common 4q25 AF susceptibility allele (rs2200733) is 
associated with PR interval prolongation in patients with lone and typical AF 
and controls with no AF. Given that prolonged PR interval is an established risk 
factor for AF, this observation, in the context of previously described 
functional effects of PITX2 deficiency, provides further knowledge about the 
pathophysiological link of 4q25 variants with AF.
