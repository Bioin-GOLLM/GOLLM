A new high-pressure single-crystal diffraction setup has been designed and 
implemented at the Australian Synchrotron for collecting molecular and protein 
crystal structures. The setup incorporates a modified micro-Merrill-Bassett cell 
and holder designed specifically to fit onto the horizontal air-bearing 
goniometer, allowing high-pressure diffraction measurements to be collected with 
little to no modification of the beamline setup compared with ambient data 
collections. Compression data for the amino acid, L-threonine, and the protein, 
hen egg-white lysozyme, were collected, showcasing the capabilities of the 
setup.
