Over the last few years, the number of microRNAs in the human genome has become 
a controversially debated issue. Several publications reported thousands of 
putative novel microRNAs not included in the curated microRNA gene database 
MirGeneDB and the repository miRBase. Recently, by using sequencing of ∼300 
human tissues and cell lines, the human RNA atlas, an expanded inventory of 
human RNA annotations, was published, reporting thousands of putative microRNAs. 
We, the developers of established microRNA prediction tools and hosts of 
MirGeneDB, raise concerns about the frequently applied prediction and functional 
validation strategies, briefly discussing the drawbacks of false positive 
detections. By means of quantifying well-established biogenesis-derived 
features, we show that the reported novel microRNAs essentially represent 
false-positives and argue that the human microRNA complement, at about 550 
microRNA genes, is already near complete. Output of available tools must be 
curated as false predictions will misguide scientists looking for biomarkers or 
therapeutic targets.
