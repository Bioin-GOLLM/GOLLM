BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, degenerative 
neuromuscular disease characterized by a progressive loss of voluntary motor 
activity. About 95% of ALS patients are in "sporadic form"-meaning their disease 
is not associated with a family history of the disease. To date, the genetic 
factors of the sporadic form of ALS are poorly understood.
METHODS: We proposed a two-stage approach based on seventeen biological 
plausible models to search for two-locus combinations that have significant 
joint effects to the disease in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We used 
a two-stage strategy to reduce the computational burden associated with 
performing an exhaustive two-locus search across the genome. In the first stage, 
all SNPs were screened using a single-marker test. In the second stage, all 
pairs made from the 1000 SNPs with the lowest p-values from the first stage were 
evaluated under each of the 17 two-locus models.
RESULTS: we performed the two-stage approach on a GWAS data set of sporadic ALS 
from the SNP Database at the NINDS Human Genetics Resource Center DNA and Cell 
Line Repository http://ccr.coriell.org/ninds/. Our two-locus analysis showed 
that two two-locus combinations--rs4363506 (SNP1) and rs3733242 (SNP2), and 
rs4363506 and rs16984239 (SNP3) -- were significantly associated with sporadic 
ALS. After adjusting for multiple tests and multiple models, the combination of 
SNP1 and SNP2 had a p-value of 0.032 under the Dom intersection Dom epistatic 
model; SNP1 and SNP3 had a p-value of 0.042 under the Dom x Dom multiplicative 
model.
CONCLUSION: The proposed two-stage analytical method can be used to search for 
joint effects of genes in GWAS. The two-stage strategy decreased the 
computational time and the multiple testing burdens associated with GWAS. We 
have also observed that the loci identified by our two-stage strategy can not be 
detected by single-locus tests.
