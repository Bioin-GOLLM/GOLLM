BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive lung cancer 
subtype with poor survival and limited treatment options. Sequencing results 
have revealed gene mutations associated with SCLC, however, the correlation 
between the genomic alterations and clinical prognosis of SCLC is yet unclear.
METHODS: Targeted next-generation sequencing of 62 cancer related genes was 
performed on 53 SCLC samples. The correlations between clinical outcomes and 
genomic alterations were analyzed.
RESULTS: 38/62 (61.3%) candidate genes harbored some alterations, while all the 
SCLC samples carried at least 3 gene mutations. The most common nonsynonymous 
mutations included ERBB2 (95.9%), CREBBP (95.9%), and TP53 (77.6%). The median 
nonsynonymous tumor mutation burden (TMB) was 21.7 mutations/Mb (rang, 
9.3-55.9). High TMB (> 21 mutations/Mb) was good prognostic factor in overall 
survival (OS) (21.7 vs. 10.4 months, P = 0.012). Multivariate analysis showed 
that high TMB was an independent prognostic factor. The overall survival (OS) of 
patients carrying KIAA1211 mutation was significantly longer than those with 
wild-type KIAA1211 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The current study highlights the potential role of genomic 
alterations for the prognosis of SCLC. Higher TMB was associated with a better 
prognosis, and KIAA1211 might be a good prognostic factor in SCLC.
