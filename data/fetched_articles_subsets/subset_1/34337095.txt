BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
reinfections have been reported; however, most cases are milder than the primary 
infection. We report the first case of a life-threatening critical presentation 
of a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.
METHODS: A 62-year-old man from Palamós (Spain) suffered a first mild 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) episode in March 2020, confirmed by 2 
independent SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and 
a normal radiograph. He recovered completely and tested negative on 2 
consecutive PCRs. In August 2020, the patient developed a second SARS-CoV-2 
infection with life-threatening bilateral pneumonia and Acute respiratory 
distress syndrome criteria, requiring COVID-19-specific treatment (remdesivir + 
dexamethasone) plus high-flow oxygen therapy. Nasopharyngeal swabs from the 
second episode were obtained for virus quantification by real-time PCR, for 
virus outgrowth and sequencing. In addition, plasma and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells during the hospitalization period were used to determine 
SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and T-cell responses.
RESULTS: Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 showed that the virus had probably 
originated shortly before symptom onset. When the reinfection occurred, the 
subject showed a weak immune response, with marginal humoral and specific T-cell 
responses against SARS-CoV-2. All antibody isotypes tested as well as SARS-CoV-2 
neutralizing antibodies increased sharply after day 8 postsymptoms. A slight 
increase of T-cell responses was observed at day 19 after symptom onset.
CONCLUSIONS: The reinfection was firmly documented and occurred in the absence 
of robust preexisting humoral and cellular immunity. SARS-CoV-2 immunity in some 
subjects is unprotective and/or short-lived; therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
schedules inducing long-term immunity will be required to bring the pandemic 
under control.
