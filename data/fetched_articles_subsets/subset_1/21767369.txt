Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is an extremely unusual finding in early infancy. In 
the present report we describe a one-month-old previously healthy male infant 
who presented with unilateral acrocyanosis. Although infantile acrocyanosis is 
known to be a benign and self-resolving condition, it is generally bilateral and 
symmetric. The unilateral nature of the acrocyanosis was an atypical finding in 
this infant. Consequently, he was closely monitored to evaluate the progression 
of his acrocyanosis. Based on his benign clinical course and failure to 
demonstrate other etiologies contributing to his acrocyanosis, he was diagnosed 
to have primary RP. Due to the rarity of RP in children, we review the progress 
in understanding the pathophysiology, epidemiology and management of RP and 
additionally discuss the differential diagnosis of unilateral and bilateral 
acrocyanosis in infants.
