Although there is a strong correlation between CAG repeat length and age at 
onset (AO) of motor symptoms, individual Huntington disease (HD) patients may 
differ dramatically in onset age and disease manifestations despite similar CAG 
repeat lengths. This has led to a search for genetic factors that influence AO. 
In order to identify such a genetic modifier, we analysed polymorphisms in the 
PGC-1alpha gene. Recent data indicate inhibition of PGC-1alpha function by 
mutant Htt supporting a link between transcriptional deregulation and 
mitochondrial dysfunction in HD. In > 400 HD patients, a polymorphism located 
within intron 2, a potential recombination hot spot, explains a small, but 
statistically significant, amount of the variability in AO. Our data suggest 
that PGC-1alpha has modifying effects on the pathogenic process in HD.
