The efficacy of CAR-T cells for solid tumors is unsatisfactory. EpCAM is a 
biomarker of epithelial tumors, but the clinical feasibility of CAR-T therapy 
targeting EpCAM is lacking. Here, we report pre- and clinical investigations of 
EpCAM-CAR-T cells for solid tumors. We demonstrated that EpCAM-CAR-T cells 
costimulated by Dectin-1 exhibited robust antitumor activity without adverse 
effects in xenograft mouse models and EpCAM-humanized mice. Notably, in clinical 
trials for epithelial tumors (NCT02915445), 6 (50%) of the 12 enrolled patients 
experienced self-remitted grade 1/2 toxicities, 1 patient (8.3%) experienced 
reversible grade 3 leukopenia, and no higher-grade toxicity reported. Efficacy 
analysis determined two patients as partial response. Three patients showed >23 
months of progression-free survival, among whom one patient experienced 2-year 
progress-free survival with detectable CAR-T cells 200 days after infusion. 
These data demonstrate the feasibility and tolerability of EpCAM-CAR-T therapy.
