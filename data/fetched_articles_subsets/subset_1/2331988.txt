Leucine residues at positions 12, 16 and 19 of salmon calcitonin were 
systematically replaced by alanine either one, two or three at a time. 
Substitution of Ala at positions 12 or 16 had the greatest effect on the 
structure of the peptide and on the ability of the peptide to attain structures 
of higher helical content in the presence of lipid. Despite the similar effects 
on the conformational properties, the effects on activity are markedly different 
for analogs with Ala substitutions at positions 12 and 16. The Ala12 derivatives 
are much less active while the Ala16 derivatives are slightly more active than 
the parent hormone. In contrast to the effects of substitutions at these 
positions, substitution of Ala at position 19 has relatively little effect on 
activity or on conformation. These results demonstrate that different regions of 
the calcitonin molecule have different conformational requirements for maximal 
activity.
