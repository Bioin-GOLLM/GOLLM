We describe X-ray computed tomography (CT) datasets from three specimens 
recovered from Early Cretaceous lakebeds of China that illustrate the forensic 
interpretation of CT imagery for paleontology. Fossil vertebrates from thinly 
bedded sediments often shatter upon discovery and are commonly repaired as 
amalgamated mosaics grouted to a solid backing slab of rock or plaster. Such 
methods are prone to inadvertent error and willful forgery, and once required 
potentially destructive methods to identify mistakes in reconstruction. CT is an 
efficient, nondestructive alternative that can disclose many clues about how a 
specimen was handled and repaired. These annotated datasets illustrate the power 
of CT in documenting specimen integrity and are intended as a reference in 
applying CT more broadly to evaluating the authenticity of comparable fossils.
