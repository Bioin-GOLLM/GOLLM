Arguments for a just transition are integral to debates about climate change and 
the drive to create a carbon-neutral economy. There are currently two broad 
approaches rooted in ethics and justice for framing just energy transitions. The 
first can be described as internal to the transition and emphasizes the 
anticipation, assessment, and redressing of harms created by the transition 
itself and the inclusion in transition governance of groups or communities 
potentially harmed by its disruptions. In this article, we propose a second 
approach to ethics and justice in an energy transition, which we describe as 
systemic or societal in scope. This approach complements attention to the 
proximate dynamics and impacts of the transition process with a focus on the 
distant societal and economic outcomes the transition brings into being and how 
they compare to conditions prior to the transition. It poses the question: do 
the transformative social, economic, and technological changes wrought by energy 
systems create more just societies and economies, or do they instead reinforce 
or recreate long-standing injustices and inequalities? We illustrate this 
approach with an assessment of one of the most significant existing forms of 
energy injustice: the energy-poverty nexus. We argue that the energy-poverty 
nexus reflects configurations of socio-energy systems that create complex, 
extractive feedbacks between energy insecurity and economic insecurity and, over 
time, reinforce or exacerbate poverty. We further argue that just energy 
transitions should work to disentangle these configurations and re-design them 
so as to create generative rather than extractive feedbacks, thus ending the 
energy-poverty nexus and creating long-term outcomes that are more just, 
equitable, and fair.
