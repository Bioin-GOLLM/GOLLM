BACKGROUND: This study is the first to examine the association between plasma 
levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the antisuicidal effects 
of repeated ketamine infusions in depressed patients with suicidal ideation.
METHODS: Fifty-seven depressed patients with suicidal ideation received six 
ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg) during a 12 days period. Suicidality was measured 
with the Scale for Suicidal Ideations (SSI-part 1), item 10 of the 
Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and item 3 of the Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) at baseline, 1 day after the first infusion 
(1 day), 1 day after the sixth infusion (13 days), and at 2 weeks after the last 
infusion (26 days). Plasma levels of BDNF were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay at baseline, 13 days, and 26 days.
RESULTS: Overall, 46 (80.7%) depressed patients with suicidal ideation had an 
antisuicidal response at 13 days. Despite a significant reduction in suicidal 
symptoms over time, no changes in plasma levels of BDNF were found after 
ketamine treatment when compared with baseline. Correlation analysis showed that 
no significant association was observed between the plasma levels of BDNF and 
the changes in the severity of suicidal symptoms as measured by SSI-part 1, item 
10 of the MADRS, or item 3 of the HAMD at 1 day, 13 days, and 26 days (all 
p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that plasma levels of BDNF may not serve as a 
biomarker for determining the antisuicidal effects of six ketamine infusions in 
depressed patients with suicidal ideation.
