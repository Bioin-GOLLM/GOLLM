We recorded from neurons in the nidopallium caudolaterale, the avian equivalent 
of the mammalian prefrontal cortex, in four birds. The birds were required to 
peck a stimulus that indicated the amount of reward they would receive (small or 
large) after a certain delay (short or long). We found that the activity of 
neurons in the nidopallium caudolaterale was modulated by the value of the 
reward that would be received based on the reward amount and the delay to 
reward. We found that value coding was most prominent during the presentation of 
the sample period, and less so during the delay period and during the 
presentation of the reward itself. Our findings support the view that activity 
in nidopallium caudolaterale reflects the encoding of the value of reward based 
on a combination of reward amount and delay to a reward.
