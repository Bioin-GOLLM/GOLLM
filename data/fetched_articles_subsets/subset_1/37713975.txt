BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is associated with Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV) infection. To test preclinical NPC drugs, we established two 
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models, EBV-positive PDX-B13 and 
EBV-negative PDX-Li41, for drug screening.
METHODS: Based on next generation sequencing (NGS) studies, PDX-B13 had CCND1 
copy number (CN) gain but CDKN2A CN loss, whereas PDX-Li41 had CDKN2A and RB1 CN 
loss, TSC1 (negative regulator of mTOR) frameshift deletion mutation, and 
increased activation of mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase that governs metabolism, 
autophagy, and apoptosis. Increased mTOR was also associated with poor NPC 
prognosis.
RESULTS: Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, suppressed tumor growth in the two PDX 
NPC models and had an additive antitumor effect with palbociclib, a CDK4/6 
inhibitor. PDX tumors treated with various drugs or untreated were subjected to 
RNA sequencing, transcriptome profile analysis, and selective Western blotting 
to understand the interactions between these drugs and gene expression profiles. 
Palbociclib also suppressed EB viral nuclear antigen (EBNA1) expression in 
PDX-B13. Everolimus together with autophagy inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine, had 
additive anti-tumor effect on PDX-B13 tumor. Immunohistochemistry revealed that 
high mTOR levels were correlated with poor overall survival in patients with 
metastatic NPC (N = 90).
CONCLUSIONS: High mTOR levels are a poor prognostic factor in NPC, and cell 
cycle, mTOR and autophagy pathways may serve as therapeutic targets in NPC. In 
addition, PDX models can be used for efficiently testing potential NPC drugs.
