Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis carries a significant morbidity and 
mortality in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). Next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are highly 
CNS-penetrant and have demonstrated remarkable intracranial activity across 
clinical studies, and yet radiation remains the mainstay of treatment modality 
against CNS metastasis. We have previously reported alectinib can induce CNS 
radiation necrosis even after a remote history of radiation (7 years 
post-radiation). Lorlatinib is another potent next-generation ALK TKI that can 
overcome many ALK resistance mutations and has been shown to have excellent 
activity in patients with baseline CNS metastasis. Here we report two 
ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who developed radiation necrosis shortly after 
initiating lorlatinib following progression on the sequential treatment of 
crizotinib, alectinib, and brigatinib. In both cases, radiation necrosis is 
evidenced by serial MRI images and histological examination of the resected CNS 
metastasis that had previously been radiated. Our cases highlight the importance 
of recognizing CNS radiation necrosis that may mimic disease progression in 
ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with and potentially precipated by next-generation 
ALK TKIs.
