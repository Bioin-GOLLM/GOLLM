In vitro cell cultures are frequently used to define the molecular background of 
drug resistance. The majority of currently available data have been obtained 
from 2D in vitro cultures, however, 3D cell culture systems (spheroids) are more 
likely to behave similarly to in vivo conditions. Our major aim was to compare 
the gene expression signature of 2D and 3D cultured BRAFV600E mutant melanoma 
cell lines. We successfully developed BRAF-drug resistant cell lines from paired 
primary/metastatic melanoma cell lines in both 2D and 3D in vitro cultures. 
Using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays, we determined the gene expression 
pattern of all cell lines. Our analysis revealed 1049 genes (562 upregulated and 
487 downregulated) that were differentially expressed between drug-sensitive 
cells grown under different cell cultures. Pathway analysis showed that the 
differently expressed genes were mainly associated with the cell cycle, p53, and 
other cancer-related pathways. The number of upregulated genes (72 genes) was 
remarkably fewer when comparing the resistant adherent cells to cells that grow 
in 3D, and were associated with cell adhesion molecules and IGF1R signalling. 
Only 1% of the upregulated and 5.6% of the downregulated genes were commonly 
altered between the sensitive and the resistant spheroids. Interestingly, we 
found several genes (BNIP3, RING1 and ABHD4) with inverse expression signature 
between sensitive and resistant spheroids, which are involved in anoikis 
resistance and cell cycle regulation. In summary, our study highlights gene 
expression alterations that might help to understand the development of acquired 
resistance in melanoma cells in tumour tissue.
