AIMS: To investigate the association of the paired box gene 6 (PAX6) with 
different severities of myopia.
METHODS: A total of four haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs; rs2071754, rs3026354, rs3026390 and rs628224) and two previously reported 
SNPs (rs644242 and rs662702) in the PAX6 gene were analysed in a Hong Kong 
Chinese cohort of 1288 myopia subjects (including 252 extreme myopia, 277 high 
myopia, 393 moderate myopia and 366 mild myopia) and 791 no myopia controls. 
Allelic association analyses were performed for individual SNPs in different 
subgroups of myopia and in combined myopia, followed by a meta-analysis of our 
current data with reported data on PAX6 in myopia.
RESULTS: The association of tagging SNPs rs2071754 and rs644242 with extreme 
myopia could not withstand multiple correction (rs2071754: OR=1.25, P 
value=0.031; rs644242: OR=1.33, P value=0.032). In the meta-analysis, rs644242 
showed an enhanced, significant association with extreme myopia (OR=1.27, 95% CI 
1.10 to 1.46, P value=0.001; I2=0%). In contrast, there was no significant 
association between the PAX6SNPs and high, moderate or mild myopia. No linear 
correlation was found between the PAX6SNPs and axial length.
CONCLUSION: This study provides additional evidence suggesting that the PAX6 SNP 
rs644242 is associated with extreme myopia but not lower grade myopia. Thus, 
PAX6 may be implicated in the development or progression into severe myopia. 
Further longitudinal studies are warranted.
