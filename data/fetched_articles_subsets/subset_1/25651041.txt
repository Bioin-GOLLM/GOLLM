PURPOSE: To investigate the individual radiosensitivity of the human genome in 
long-term residents of areas with high radon concentration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials used for this investigation were venous 
blood samples extracted from children living in the boarding school of Tashtagol 
(Kemerovo Region, Russia). Cytogenetic damage assessment was performed using the 
cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN) on peripheral blood lymphocytes. 
PCR, gel electrophoresis and product detection using a transilluminator were 
used to determine polymorphisms in the genes ADPRT (rs 1136410), hOGG1 (rs 
1052133), NBS1 (rs 1805794), XRCC1 (rs 25487), XpC (rs 2228001), XpD (rs 13181), 
and XpG (rs 17655). Statistical analysis was performed using nonparametric 
methods. To ensure accurate results, FDR-correction for multiple comparisons was 
performed.
RESULTS: We discovered a significant increase in the frequency of binucleated 
lymphocytes with micronuclei (MN) in carriers of the His/His genotype of the XpG 
gene Asp1104His polymorphism in comparison to heterozygous and homozygous 
carriers of the Asp allele. In addition, the Ala/Ala genotype for the ADPRT gene 
Val762Ala polymorphism and the Glu/Gln genotype for the NBS1 gene Glu185Gln 
polymorphism were associated with the elevated frequency of binucleated 
lymphocytes with nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB).
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of this study, the elevated frequency of cytogenetic 
damage in people with particular DNA-repair gene polymorphisms in response to 
chronic exposure to radon was demonstrated. It was shown that the genes and 
corresponding polymorphisms (the XpG gene Asp1104His polymorphism, the ADPRT 
gene Val762Ala polymorphism and the NBS1 gene Glu185Gln polymorphism) can be 
used as molecular genetic markers of increased individual radiosensitivity in 
long-term residents of areas with high concentrations of radon.
