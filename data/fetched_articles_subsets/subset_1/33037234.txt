Mutations that lead to constitutive activation of key regulators in cellular 
processes are one of the most important drivers behind vigorous growth of cancer 
cells, and are thus prime targets in cancer treatment. BRAF V600E mutation 
transduces strong growth and survival signals for cancer cells, and is widely 
present in various types of cancers including lung cancer. A combination of BRAF 
inhibitor (dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitor (trametinib) has recently been approved 
and significantly improved the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC 
harboring BRAF V600E/K mutation. To improve the detection of BRAF V600E/K 
mutation and investigate the incidence and clinicopathological features of the 
mutation in lung cancer patients of southern Taiwan, a highly sensitive and 
specific real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method, able to detect 
single-digit copies of mutant DNA, was established and compared with BRAF 
V600E-specific immunohistochemistry. Results showed that the BRAF V600E mutation 
was present at low frequency (0.65%, 2/306) in the studied patient group, and 
the detection sensitivity and specificity of the new RT-qPCR and V600E-specific 
immunohistochemistry both reached 100% and 97.6%, respectively. Screening the 
BRAF V600E/K mutation with the RT-qPCR and V600E-specific immunohistochemistry 
simultaneously could help improve detection accuracy.
