In the title mol-ecule, C14H26Br2O, the central carbonyl group (C3O) is 
essentially planar (r.m.s. deviation = 0.0021 Å). The Br atoms lie on the same 
side of the mol-ecule and are approximately syn, with a Br-C⋯C-Br torsion angle 
of -43.52 (13)°. The crystal structure is devoid of any specific inter-molecular 
inter-actions.
