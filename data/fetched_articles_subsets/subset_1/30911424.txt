This is a case of a patient who presented to the emergency department with acute 
abdominal pain due to bowel obstruction. An extended right hemicolectomy with 
ileosigmoid anastomosis due to an obstructing mass on the splenic flexure was 
urgently performed. During operation, liver and peritoneal lesions were detected 
and samples were also sent for histological analysis. Pathology report was 
consistent with poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring 
cells; peritoneal lesions were confirmed histologically as metastatic. Genetic 
testing revealed the BRAFV600E mutation and mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR). 
After progressing on 1st line chemotherapy, the patient has a continuing and 
long-lasting partial response to 2nd line treatment with pembrolizumab.
