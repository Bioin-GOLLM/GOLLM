BACKGROUND: Estrogen is known to decrease the risk of colon cancer in 
postmenopausal women, and may exert its actions by decreasing interleukin-6 
(IL6) production via stabilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor 
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB). Estrogens are 
biosynthesized by CYP19A1 (aromatase), so it is possible that genetic variations 
in CYP19A1 influences the risk of colon cancer by altering expression of 
CYP19A1. Further, studies on gene-gene interactions suggest that single 
nucleotide polymorphisms in one gene may affect expression of other genes. The 
current study aims to explore the role of CYP19A1 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms on CYP19A1, NFκB1 and IL6 gene expression.
METHODS: Phenotype-genotype associations, cross-associations between genes, and 
haplotype analyses were performed in both normal human colon (n=82) and liver 
(n=238) samples.
RESULTS: CYP19A1 rs10459592, rs1961177, and rs6493497 were associated with 
CYP19A1 expression in colon samples (P=0.042, P=0.041, and P=0.013, 
respectively). CYP19A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs12908960, rs730154, 
rs8025191, and rs17523880) were correlated with NFκB1 expression (P=0.047, 
P=0.04, P=0.05, and P=0.03, respectively), and CYP19A1 rs11856927, rs2470152, 
and rs2470144 (P=0.049, P=0.025, P=0.047, respectively) were associated with IL6 
expression in the colon. While rs730154 and rs17523880 could not be analyzed in 
the liver samples, none of the other associations with the colon were replicated 
in the liver samples. Haplotype analysis revealed three separate haplotypes of 
the CYP19A1 single nucleotide polymorphism that were significantly associated 
with CYP19A1, NFκB1, and IL6 gene expression.
CONCLUSION: CYP19A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated not only with 
CYP19A1 expression but also with NFκB1 and IL6 expression. These data 
demonstrate the possible functional consequences of genetic variation within the 
CYP19A1 gene on other genes in a biologically plausible pathway.
