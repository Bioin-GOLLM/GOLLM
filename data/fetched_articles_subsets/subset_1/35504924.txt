IRF4 is a master regulator of immunity and is also frequently overexpressed in 
mature lymphoid neoplasms. Here, we demonstrate the oncogenicity of IRF4 in 
vivo, its potential effects on T-cell development and clonal evolution using a 
zebrafish model. IRF4-transgenic zebrafish develop aggressive tumors with 
massive infiltration of abnormal lymphocytes that spread to distal organs. Many 
late-stage tumors are mono- or oligoclonal, and tumor cells can expand in 
recipient animals after transplantation, demonstrating their malignancy. 
Mutation of p53 accelerates tumor onset, increases penetrance, and results in 
tumor heterogeneity. Surprisingly, single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals that the 
majority of tumor cells are double-negative T-cells, many of which express tcr-γ 
that became dominant as the tumors progress, whereas double-positive T-cells are 
largely diminished. Gene expression and epigenetic profiling demonstrates that 
gata3, mycb, lrrn1, patl1 and psip1 are specifically activated in tumors, while 
genes responsible for T-cell differentiation including id3 are repressed. 
IRF4-driven tumors are sensitive to the BRD inhibitor.
