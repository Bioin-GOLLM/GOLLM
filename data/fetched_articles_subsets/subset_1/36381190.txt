The 11,12-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) is formed from arachidonic acid 
(AA) by cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP 2J2) epoxygenase and function as an effector in 
blood vessels. Human endothelial progenitor cells (hEPCs), a preceding cell 
source for endothelial cells (ECs), involve in the vascular tissue repairing by 
postnatal neovasculogenesis. However, the effect of 11, 12-EET on hEPCs and 
neovasculogenesis is not well known. In the current study, we examined the 
function of 11, 12-EET in hEPCs-mediated neovasculogenesis by using tubular 
formation analysis, Western Blotting assay, immunofluorescence staining, flow 
cytometry analysis and zymogram analysis. The results suggest that 11, 12-EET 
significantly induces neovasculogenesis through the phosphorylation of 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt, endothelial-nitric oxide synthase (e-NOS) 
and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) signaling pathways. 11, 
12-EET up-regulates the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 
(CDK4) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) proteins. Moreover, 11, 12-EET 
augments the expression of VE-cadherin and CD31 proteins in hEPCs. 11, 12-EET 
also augmented Rac1/Rho A signaling cascades, cell migration and an 
up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2 and -9 proteins. These 
results demonstrate that 11, 12-EET exerts a significant function in the 
neovasculogenesis of hEPCs.
