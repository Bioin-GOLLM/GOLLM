The development of the cardiac outflow tract (OFT), which connects the heart to 
the great arteries, relies on a complex crosstalk between endothelial (ECs) and 
smooth muscle (SMCs) cells. Defects in OFT development can lead to severe 
malformations, including aortic aneurysms, which are frequently associated with 
impaired TGF-β signaling. To better understand the role of TGF-β signaling in 
OFT formation, we generated zebrafish lacking the TGF-β receptor Alk5 and found 
a strikingly specific dilation of the OFT: alk5-/- OFTs exhibit increased EC 
numbers as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) and SMC disorganization. 
Surprisingly, endothelial-specific alk5 overexpression in alk5-/- rescues the 
EC, ECM, and SMC defects. Transcriptomic analyses reveal downregulation of the 
ECM gene fibulin-5, which when overexpressed in ECs ameliorates OFT morphology 
and function. These findings reveal a new requirement for endothelial TGF-β 
signaling in OFT morphogenesis and suggest an important role for the endothelium 
in the etiology of aortic malformations.
