BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 
modulators represent targeted therapies directly acting on the CFTR channel. The 
triple therapy Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) has been 
demonstrated to improve lung function and quality of life in cystic fibrosis 
(CF) patients. However, the effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA on sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB) and respiratory muscle strength are poorly studied. The aim of this study 
was to assess the effects of ELX/TEZ/IVA in patients with CF and severe lung 
disease on cardiorespiratory polygraphy parameters, maximum inspiratory pressure 
(MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) measures.
METHODS: patients with CF aged ≥ 12 who started treatment in a compassionate use 
program were retrospectively studied through the evaluation of nocturnal 
cardiorespiratory polygraphy parameters, MIP and MEP; and six-minute walk test 
(6MWT) at baseline and at months 3, 6, and 12 of treatment.
RESULTS: Nine patients (mean age 30.3 ± 6.5 years) with severe CF (mean baseline 
ppFEV1 34.6 ± 5.1%) were evaluated. A significant improvement in nocturnal 
oxygenation measured by mean SpO2 (92.4 vs. 96.4%, p < 0.05), time spent with 
SpO2 ≤ 90% (-12.6, -14.6, -15.2 min from baseline at months 3, 6, and 12, 
respectively, p < 0.05), and respiratory rate (RR) was shown, at month 12 and 
across the time points compared with baseline, as well as in respiratory muscle 
strength, although only the change in MEP was significant.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide further evidence on the efficacy of the CFTR modulators 
ELX/TEZ/IVA, adding information about their effect on the respiratory muscles' 
performance and cardiorespiratory polygraphy parameters in CF patients with 
severe lung disease.
