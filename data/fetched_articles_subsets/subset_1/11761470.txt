Mutations of copper,zinc-superoxide dismutase (cu,zn SOD) are found in patients 
with a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. When expressed in 
transgenic mice, mutant human cu,zn SOD causes progressive loss of motor neurons 
with consequent paralysis and death. Expression profiling of gene expression in 
SOD1-G93A transgenic mouse spinal cords indicates extensive glial activation 
coincident with the onset of paralysis at 3 months of age. This is followed by 
activation of genes involved in metal ion regulation (metallothionein-I, 
metallothionein-III, ferritin-H, and ferritin-L) at 4 months of age just prior 
to end-stage disease, perhaps as an adaptive response to the mitochondrial 
destruction caused by the mutant protein. Induction of ferritin-H and -L gene 
expression may also limit iron catalyzed hydroxyl radical formation and 
consequent oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Thus, glial 
activation and adaptive responses to metal ion dysregulation are features of 
disease in this transgenic model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
