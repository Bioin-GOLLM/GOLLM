PURPOSE: FOXC1 mutations result in Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, a disorder 
characterized by a broad spectrum of malformations of the anterior segment of 
the eye and an elevated risk for glaucoma. A novel FOXC1 W152G mutation was 
identified in a patient with aniridia. Molecular analysis was conducted to 
determine the functional consequences of the FOXC1 W152G mutation.
METHODS: Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the W152G mutation into 
the FOXC1 complementary DNA. The levels of W152G protein expression and the 
functional abilities of the mutant protein were determined.
RESULTS: After screening for mutations in PAX6, CYP1B1, and FOXC1, a novel FOXC1 
W152G mutation was identified in a newborn boy with aniridia and congenital 
glaucoma. Molecular analysis of the W152G mutation revealed that the mutant 
protein has severe molecular consequences in FOXC1, including defects in 
phosphorylation, protein folding, DNA-binding ability, inability to 
transactivate a reporter gene, and nuclear localization. Although W152G has 
molecular defects similar to those of the previously studied FOXC1 L130F 
mutation, W152G causes a more severe phenotype than L130F. Both the W152G and 
the L130F mutations result in the formation of protein aggregates in the 
cytoplasm. However, unlike the L130F aggregates, the W152G aggregates do not 
form microtubule-dependent inclusion bodies, known as aggresomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe molecular consequences, including the inability of the W152G 
protein aggregates to form protective aggresomes, may underlie the aniridia 
phenotype that results from the FOXC1 W152G mutation.
