Chronic alcohol consumption is characterized by disturbances of neuroplasticity. 
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is believed to be critically involved 
in this process. Here we aimed to review actual experimental and clinical data 
related to BDNF participation in neuroplasticity in the context of alcohol 
dependence. As has been shown in experiments with rodents, alcohol consumption 
is accompanied by the brain region-specific changes of BDNF expression and by 
structural and behavioral impairments. BDNF reverses aberrant neuroplasticity 
observed during alcohol intoxication. According to the clinical data parameters 
associated with BDNF demonstrate close correlation with neuroplastic changes 
accompanying alcohol dependence. In particular, the rs6265 polymorphism within 
the BDNF gene is associated with macrostructural changes in the brain, while 
peripheral BDNF concentration may be associated with anxiety, depression, and 
cognitive impairment. Thus, BDNF is involved in the mechanisms of 
alcohol-induced changes of neuroplasticity, and polymorphisms within the BDNF 
gene and peripheral BDNF concentration may serve as biomarkers, diagnostic or 
prognostic factors in treatment of alcohol abuse.
