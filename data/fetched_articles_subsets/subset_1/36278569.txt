BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a deoxyribonucleic acid virus that affects 
a significant proportion of the worldwide population; after primary infection, 
it goes into a latent state and can be reactivated, primarily after a reduction 
in host immune defenses.
METHODS: This study evaluated the association of acute cytomegalovirus infection 
(CMV IgM) and Allostatic Load (AL) by sociodemographic factors using data from 
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2004 among 
participants (aged 20-49 years). CMV infection was determined by the level of 
CMV IgM antibody in serum samples. AL was assessed as a combination of 10 
biomarkers from the cardiovascular, inflammatory, and metabolic systems. The 
evaluation of the association between CMV infection and AL included descriptive 
statistics and logistic regression models, which were adjusted for demographic 
and behavioral covariates.
RESULTS: AL was more elevated among those who were older, male, those with lower 
education, those performing limited physical activity, and smokers. CMV was more 
elevated in females than males among those who consumed alcohol and cigarette 
smokers. In Pearson's correlation analysis, there was a slight positive 
correlation between CMV IgM and AL, with triglycerides and Body Mass Index (BMI) 
the most strongly correlated with AL. Binary logistic regression showed no 
significant relationship between high AL and positive CMV IgM but did show a 
significant relationship between high AL and age (OR = 1.0592, 95% CI 
1.0215-1.0983, p = 0.00715). The findings of this study provide insight into the 
relationship between CMV and AL and provide awareness of factors that affect 
their relationship.
