BACKGROUND: The mitochondrial DNA mutation A3302G in the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene 
causes respiratory chain complex I deficiency. The main clinical feature appears 
to be a progressive mitochondrial myopathy with proximal muscle weakness.
OBJECTIVE: To report on clinical and molecular features in 4 novel patients with 
the A3302G mutation.
DESIGN: Case reports.
PATIENTS: Four patients (3 of whom are from the same family) with a myopathy 
caused by the A3302G mitochondrial DNA mutation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Identification of the A3302G mutation by DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: All 4 patients had an adult-onset progressive mitochondrial myopathy 
with proximal muscle weakness, resulting in exercise intolerance. In 2 unrelated 
patients, upper limb reflexes were absent with preservation of at least some 
lower limb reflexes. Other features including hearing loss, recurrent headaches, 
ptosis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and depression were present.
CONCLUSION: While the dominant clinical features of the A3302G mutation were 
exercise intolerance and proximal muscle weakness, other features of 
mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, previously not described for this mutation, 
were present.
