Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) is required for tumor invasion/metastasis and the components 
that control this process are potential therapeutic targets. This study we 
examined the role of Gli in lung adenocarcinoma and whether its activation 
regulates metastasis through EMT in lung adenocarcinoma. We found that tumors 
with high Gli expression had significantly lower E-Cadherin expression in two 
independent cohorts of patients with lung adenocarcinoma that we studied. In 
vitro up-regulation of SHh resulted in increased cell migration while small 
molecule inhibitors of Smo or Gli significantly reduced cell mobility both in a 
wound healing assay and in a 3D cell invasion assay. Inhibition of Gli in vivo 
decreased tumor growth and induced an increase in E-Cadherin expression. Our 
results indicate that Gli may be critical for lung adenocarcinoma metastasis and 
that a novel Gli inhibitor shows promise as a therapeutic agent by preventing 
cell migration and invasion in vitro and significantly reducing tumor growth and 
increasing E-Cadherin expression in vivo.
