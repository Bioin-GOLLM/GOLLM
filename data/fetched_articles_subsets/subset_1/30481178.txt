BACKGROUND: Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium 
leprae and mainly affects skin, peripheral nerves. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene 
polymorphism has been found to be associated with leprosy. Vitamin D has been 
shown to control several host immunomodulating properties through VDR gene. 
Vitamin D deficiency was also found to be linked to an increased risk for 
several infections and metabolic diseases.
OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated the association of VDR gene 
polymorphism, mRNA gene expression of VDR and the vitamin D levels with leprosy 
and its reactional states.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 305 leprosy patients consisting of tuberculoid (TT), 
borderline tuberculoid (BT), borderline lepromatous (BL), lepromatous leprosy 
(LL), as well as 200 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. We identified 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VDR Taq1, Fok1 and Apa1, as well as 
the expression of VDR mRNA gene using PCR-based restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and real-time PCR respectively. We also performed 
ELISA to measure vitamin D levels.
RESULT: We observed that SNP of VDR gene (Fok1 and Taq1) are associated with the 
leprosy disease. The allelic frequency distribution of T and t allele (p = 
0.0037), F and f allele (p = 0.0024) was significantly higher in leprosy 
patients and healthy controls. ff genotype of Fok1 was found to be associated 
with leprosy patients [p = 0.0004; OR (95% CI) 3.148 (1.662-5.965)]. The 
recessive model of Fok1 genotype was also found to be significantly associated 
in leprosy patients in comparison to healthy controls [p = 0.00004; OR (95% CI) 
2.85 (1.56-5.22)]. Leprosy patients are significantly associated with t-F-a 
haplotype. Further, VDR gene expression was found to be lower in non-reaction 
group compared to that of reaction group of leprosy and healthy controls. 
Paradoxically, we noted no difference in the levels of vitamin D between leprosy 
patients and healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: Blood levels of vitamin D do not play any role in clinical 
manifestations of any forms of leprosy. ff genotype of Fok1 and tt genotype of 
Taq1 was found to be associated with leprosy per se. Association of t-F-a 
haplotype with leprosy was found to be significant and could be used as a 
genetic marker to identify individuals at high risk for developing leprosy. VDR 
gene expression was lower in TT/BT and BL/LL groups of leprosy in comparison to 
that of healthy controls.
