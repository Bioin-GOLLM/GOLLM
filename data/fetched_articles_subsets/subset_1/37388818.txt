PURPOSE: An intravitreally injected antisense oligonucleotide, sepofarsen, was 
designed to modulate splicing within retinas of patients with severe vision loss 
due to deep intronic c.2991 + 1655A > G variant in the CEP290 gene. A previous 
report showed vision improvements following a single injection in one eye with 
unexpected durability lasting at least 15 months. The current study evaluated 
durability of efficacy beyond 15 months in the previously treated left eye. In 
addition, peak efficacy and durability were evaluated in the treatment-naive 
right eye, and re-injection of the left eye 4 years after the first injection.
OBSERVATIONS: Visual function was evaluated with best corrected standard and 
low-luminance visual acuities, microperimetry, dark-adapted chromatic perimetry, 
and full-field sensitivity testing. Retinal structure was evaluated with OCT 
imaging. At the fovea, all visual function measures and IS/OS intensity of the 
OCT showed transient improvements peaking at 3-6 months, remaining better than 
baseline at ∼2 years, and returning to baseline by 3-4 years after each single 
injection.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: These results suggest that sepofarsen reinjection 
intervals may need to be longer than 2 years.
