Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a common adverse drug reaction in patients 
receiving antituberculosis (anti-TB) treatment. Among the anti-TB agents, 
isoniazid (INH) is the primary drug that causes hepatotoxicity in TB patients 
with DILI. Previous reports in several populations have consistently 
demonstrated an association between polymorphisms in the N-acetyltransferase 2 
(NAT2) gene, which is responsible for INH hepatic metabolism, and a risk of DILI 
in TB patients. In this study, the genetic and baseline clinical data from 366 
Japanese patients with TB (73 patients with DILI and 293 without DILI) were used 
to develop a system to predict DILI risk due to anti-TB agents. The distribution 
of the NAT2 acetylator status among the TB patients with DILI was 31 (42.5%), 29 
(39.7%), and 13 (17.8%) for rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylators, 
respectively. A significant association was observed between NAT2 slow 
acetylators and DILI risk (odds ratio 4.32, 95% confidence interval 1.93-9.66, P 
value=5.56Ã—10(-4)). A logistic regression model based on age and NAT2 genotype 
revealed that the area under the curve for the receiver-operating characteristic 
curve was 0.717. The findings demonstrated that slow NAT2 acetylator status is a 
significant predictor of the risk of DILI by anti-TB agents, and a personalized 
anti-TB treatment approach may aid in making treatment decisions and reducing 
the incidence of DILI.
