A single mutation in the GALC gene is responsible for the majority of late onset 
Krabbe disease patients in the Catania (Sicily, Italy) region.

A high proportion of patients with late onset forms of Krabbe disease is 
observed in a region north of Catania in Sicily. Molecular analysis in five 
families from this region shows that this condition is mainly due to a not 
previously described p.Gly41Ser substitution in the GALC gene that abolishes 
catalytic activity of the galactocerebrosidase enzyme, as shown by expression 
studies. Three patients were homozygous for this mutation, the other two were 
heterozygous, one with a frameshift mutation and one with a missense mutation on 
the second allele. Therefore, the mutation must be a mild one since it leads to 
late onset disease in all patients. In addition, it is on a unique haplotype 
indicating that it represents a founder mutation. This is also supported by the 
fact that the mutation was not found in three late onset patients from other 
regions in Sicily, in whom four novel mutations were identified.
