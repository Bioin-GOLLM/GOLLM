A 20-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital with anemia and mild 
splenomegaly. Peripheral blood examination revealed Hb 9.4 g/dl, Ht 29.3%, RBC 
4.74 x 10(6)/microliters, reticulocytes 2.4%, WBC 5,200/microliters, platelets 
24.9 x 10(4)/microliters, MCV 61.7 fl, and MCH 19.9 pg. Poikilocytosis with 
target cells was recognized on the peripheral blood smear. A bone marrow 
aspirate revealed erythroid hyperplasia. Serum iron and ferritin were in the 
normal range. beta-thalassemia was suggested by the increase in HbA2 (6.5%) and 
HbF (7.5%). Analysis of beta globin DNA by single strand conformation 
polymorphism (SSCP) and amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) 
confirmed a diagnosis of homozygous beta(+)-thalassemia due to -31 A to G 
mutation. A familial study revealed that her parents were heterozygous for this 
allele. This is the 8th case of homozygous beta(+)-thalassemia due to -31 A to G 
mutation in Japan.
