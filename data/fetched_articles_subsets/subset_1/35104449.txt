BACKGROUND: Some people have characteristics of both asthma and COPD 
(asthma-COPD overlap), and evidence suggests they experience worse outcomes than 
those with either condition alone.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the genetic architecture of asthma-COPD overlap, and 
do the determinants of risk for asthma-COPD overlap differ from those for COPD 
or asthma?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study in 8,068 
asthma-COPD overlap case subjects and 40,360 control subjects without asthma or 
COPD of European ancestry in UK Biobank (stage 1). We followed up promising 
signals (P < 5 × 10-6) that remained associated in analyses comparing (1) 
asthma-COPD overlap vs asthma-only control subjects, and (2) asthma-COPD overlap 
vs COPD-only control subjects. These variants were analyzed in 12 independent 
cohorts (stage 2).
RESULTS: We selected 31 independent variants for further investigation in stage 
2, and discovered eight novel signals (P < 5 × 10-8) for asthma-COPD overlap 
(meta-analysis of stage 1 and 2 studies). These signals suggest a spectrum of 
shared genetic influences, some predominantly influencing asthma (FAM105A, GLB1, 
PHB, TSLP), others predominantly influencing fixed airflow obstruction (IL17RD, 
C5orf56, HLA-DQB1). One intergenic signal on chromosome 5 had not been 
previously associated with asthma, COPD, or lung function. Subgroup analyses 
suggested that associations at these eight signals were not driven by smoking or 
age at asthma diagnosis, and in phenome-wide scans, eosinophil counts, atopy, 
and asthma traits were prominent.
INTERPRETATION: We identified eight signals for asthma-COPD overlap, which may 
represent loci that predispose to type 2 inflammation, and serious long-term 
consequences of asthma.
