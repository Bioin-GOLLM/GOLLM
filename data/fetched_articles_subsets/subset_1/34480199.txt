Human sterile α motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), originally 
described as the major cellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate 
triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) balancing the intracellular deoxynucleotide (dNTP) 
pool, has come recently into focus of cancer research. As outlined in this 
review, SAMHD1 has been reported to be mutated in a variety of cancer types and 
the expression of SAMHD1 is dysregulated in many cancers. Therefore, SAMHD1 is 
regarded as a tumor suppressor in certain tumors. Moreover, it has been proposed 
that SAMHD1 might fulfill the requirements of a driver gene in tumor development 
or might promote a so-called mutator phenotype. Besides its role as a dNTPase, 
several novel cellular functions of SAMHD1 have come to light only recently, 
including a role as negative regulator of innate immune responses and as 
facilitator of DNA end resection during DNA replication and repair. Therefore, 
SAMHD1 can be placed at the crossroads of various cellular processes. The 
present review summarizes the negative role of SAMHD1 in chemotherapy 
sensitivity, highlights reported SAMHD1 mutations found in various cancer types, 
and aims to discuss functional consequences as well as underlying mechanisms of 
SAMHD1 dysregulation potentially involved in cancer development.
