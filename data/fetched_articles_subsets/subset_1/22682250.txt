Wnt signaling plays critical roles in development of various organs and 
pathogenesis of many diseases, and augmented Wnt signaling has recently been 
implicated in mammalian aging and aging-related phenotypes. We here report that 
complement C1q activates canonical Wnt signaling and promotes aging-associated 
decline in tissue regeneration. Serum C1q concentration is increased with aging, 
and Wnt signaling activity is augmented during aging in the serum and in 
multiple tissues of wild-type mice, but not in those of C1qa-deficient mice. C1q 
activates canonical Wnt signaling by binding to Frizzled receptors and 
subsequently inducing C1s-dependent cleavage of the ectodomain of Wnt coreceptor 
low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6. Skeletal muscle regeneration 
in young mice is inhibited by exogenous C1q treatment, whereas aging-associated 
impairment of muscle regeneration is restored by C1s inhibition or C1qa gene 
disruption. Our findings therefore suggest the unexpected role of complement C1q 
in Wnt signal transduction and modulation of mammalian aging.
