Inflammation plays important roles in the development of atherosclerosis and 
coronary artery disease (CAD). Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a proinflammatory 
cytokine and induces proliferation of T cells. The aim of the study was to 
understand the effect of IL-2 on the development of CAD from genetic 
polymorphism perspective and serum level perspective. IL-2 -330T/G and +114T/G 
polymorphisms were tested in 692 CAD cases and 723 healthy controls. IL-2 
expression of these two polymorphisms was compared. Serum level of IL-2 in CAD 
patients and controls was analyzed. Data showed that prevalence of IL-2 -330GG 
genotype was significantly increased in CAD than in controls (p = 5.1 Ã— 10(-6)). 
Function analysis revealed that subjects carrying IL-2 -330GG genotype had 
higher serum level of IL-2 than those with TG or TT genotypes (p < 0.01). Serum 
level of IL-2 in the study subjects was further analyzed, and results showed 
that CAD patients had significantly increased IL-2 level than healthy controls 
(p < 0.01). Also, cases with three vessels affected were observed to have higher 
IL-2 level than cases with one vessel affected (p < 0.05). These data suggested 
IL-2 polymorphism could affect the susceptibility to CAD by elevating protein 
expression, and serum level of IL-2 may be closed correlated with the 
development and progression of this disease.
