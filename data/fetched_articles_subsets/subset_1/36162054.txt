BACKGROUND: As countries reach the trachoma elimination threshold and cases of 
trachomatous inflammation follicular (TF) become rare, it becomes difficult to 
train survey graders to recognize clinical signs. We assess the use of 
photography as a grading tool, the efficiency of an in-country grading center 
and the comparability of field and photographic grading.
METHODS: During January-February 2017 surveys in Amhara, Ethiopia, field graders 
assessed TF, trachomatous inflammation intense (TI) and trachomatous scarring 
(TS). Photographs were taken from each conjunctiva and later graded at the 
Gondar Grading Center (GGC) at the University of Gondar in Amhara. Two trained 
ophthalmology residents graded each set of photographs and a third grader 
provided an adjudicating grade when needed.
RESULTS: A total of 4953 photographs of 2477 conjunctivae from 1241 participants 
in 10 communities were graded over 5 d at the GGC. Six examined participants 
were not photographed. Agreement between field and photographic grades were for 
TF: percent agreement (PA) 96.7%, κ=0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64 to 
0.77; for TI: PA 94.7%, κ=0.32 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.43); and for TS: PA 83.5%, 
κ=0.22 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.29).
CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctival photography may be a solution for programs near the 
elimination threshold where there are few available community cases for training 
field graders.
