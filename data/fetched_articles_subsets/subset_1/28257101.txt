Intercellular communication via cell-released vesicles is a very important 
process for both normal and tumor cells. Cell communication may involve 
exosomes, small vesicles of endocytic origin that are released by all types of 
cells and are found in abundance in body fluids, including blood, saliva, urine, 
and breast milk. Exosomes have been shown to carry lipids, proteins, mRNAs, 
non-coding RNAs, and even DNA out of cells. They are more than simply molecular 
garbage bins, however, in that the molecules they carry can be taken up by other 
cells. Thus, exosomes transfer biological information to neighboring cells and 
through this cell-to-cell communication are involved not only in physiological 
functions such as cell-to-cell communication, but also in the pathogenesis of 
some diseases, including tumors and neurodegenerative conditions. Our increasing 
understanding of why cells release exosomes and their role in intercellular 
communication has revealed the very complex and sophisticated contribution of 
exosomes to health and disease. The aim of this review is to reveal the emerging 
roles of exosomes in normal and pathological conditions and describe the 
controversial biological role of exosomes, as it is now understood, in 
carcinogenesis. We also summarize what is known about exosome biogenesis, 
composition, functions, and pathways and discuss the potential clinical 
applications of exosomes, especially as biomarkers and novel therapeutic agents.
