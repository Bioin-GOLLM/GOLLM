INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a common disorder characterized by decreased bone 
mineral density (BMD). Interestingly, osteoporosis and obesity have several 
similar features, including a genetic predisposition and a common bone marrow 
stem cell. With aging, the composition of bone marrow shifts to adipocytes, 
osteoclast activity increases, and osteoblast function declines, resulting in 
osteoporosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
analysis with osteoporosis and body mass index (BMI) and did identify an 
association in 349 and 384 SNPs by filtering with the significant p values 
(p < 0.001) of BMI and osteoporosis, respectively.
RESULTS: Only three of those SNPs were common (rs2326365, rs7097028, and 
rs11000205) between the SNPs significantly associated with BMI and/or 
osteoporosis in Korean Association REsource (KARE) females. Two of the three 
SNPs belonged to the ASCC1 gene and one to the FAM50B gene. We carried out a 
minor allele frequency (MAF) analysis of the rs7097028 and rs11000205 SNPs in 
the ASCC1 gene with a geographic genome variant browser. Both rs7097028 and 
rs11000205 in the ASCC1 gene were seen mostly in African and Southeast Asian 
populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the ASCC1 gene is a significant genetic 
factor for determining the risk for both osteoporosis and obesity in KARE 
postmenopausal females.
