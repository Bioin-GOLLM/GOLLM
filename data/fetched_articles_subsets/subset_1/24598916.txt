The allophanate hydrolase from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP was expressed and 
purified, and a tryptic digest fragment was subsequently identified, expressed 
and purified. This 50 kDa construct retained amidase activity and was 
crystallized. The crystals diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution and adopted space 
group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 82.4, b = 179.2, c = 112.6 Å, 
β = 106.6°.
