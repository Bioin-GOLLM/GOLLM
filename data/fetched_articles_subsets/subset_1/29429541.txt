OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of two 
PPARGC1A gene polymorphisms on metabolic outcomes in response to two 
energy-restricted diets.
METHODS: A 4-mo nutritional intervention was conducted that involved two 
different hypo-energetic diets based on low-fat (LF) and moderately high-protein 
(MHP) dietary patterns. Unrelated subjects with excessive weight were genotyped 
for two PPARGC1A polymorphisms: Rs8192678 (Gly482Ser) and rs3755863 (G > A). 
Genotyping was performed by next-generation sequencing and haplotypes were 
screened. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical tests were assessed with 
standardized methods.
RESULTS: Different cholesterol outcomes were observed by diet and Gly482Ser 
genotype. The Gly482 Gly homozygotes after an LF diet had lower reductions in 
total cholesterol (-9 mg/dL vs. -27 mg/dL; P = 0.017) and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol levels (-5 mg/dL vs. -18 mg/dL; P = 0.016) than the 
subjects who were carriers of 482 Ser allele. However, this finding was not 
recorded in the MHP group where Gly482 Gly homozygotes underwent similar 
cholesterol decreases as the 482 Ser allele carriers. Likewise, all genotype 
carriers had significant reductions in the frequencies of hypercholesterolemia 
(total cholesterol ≥200 mg/dL) except for Gly482 Gly homozygotes in the LF 
group. Meanwhile, the rs3755863 polymorphism and PPARGC1A haplotypes showed 
borderline effects with regard to cholesterol decreases.
CONCLUSIONS: An energy-restricted MHP diet might be more beneficial than an LF 
diet to reduce serum cholesterol among subjects who are carriers of the PPARGC1A 
Gly482Gly genotype. The analysis of this genetic variant might be the basis for 
a precise, nutrigenetic management of hypercholesterolemia based on genetic 
makeup.
