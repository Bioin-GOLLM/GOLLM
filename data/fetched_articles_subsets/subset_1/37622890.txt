Sepsis is an immune response to a microbial invasion that causes organ injury 
and dysfunction due to a systemic inflammatory response. Sepsis is a serious, 
life-threatening condition and a widely recognized global health challenge. 
Given its high death rate, it is critical to diagnose sepsis and start treatment 
as early as possible. There is an urgent need for a sensitive and rapid 
screening method for detecting sepsis. In this study, we investigated the use of 
MMP-9 as a biomarker for sepsis. A colorimetric paper-based biosensor was used 
for the detection of MMP-9 utilizing peptide-magnetic nanoparticle conjugates. 
The method is based on the cleavage of the MMP-9-specific peptide by the 
protease leading to the detaching of the magnetic beads from the sensor surface 
and changing of color. A fecal intraperitoneal (FIP) challenge was used to 
induce sepsis in mice, and an MMP-9 secretion was measured by taking blood and 
Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) fluid samples at 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 20 h (early 
sepsis) post-challenge intervals. The results of the paper-based sensor for the 
detection of MMP-9 levels in blood samples and BAL samples were compared with 
ELISA and Western Blot. We found that both blood and BAL levels of MMP-9 
increased immediately and could be detected as early as 1 h in FIP mice 
post-challenge. Our work adds evidence to the assertion that MMP-9 is a reliable 
biomarker for the detection of sepsis at early stages.
