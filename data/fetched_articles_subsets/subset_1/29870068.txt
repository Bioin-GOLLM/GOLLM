The J wave syndromes, including the Brugada (BrS) and early repolarization (ERS) 
syndromes, are characterized by the manifestation of prominent J waves in the 
electrocardiogram appearing as an ST segment elevation and the development of 
life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. BrS and ERS differ with respect to the 
magnitude and lead location of abnormal J waves and are thought to represent a 
continuous spectrum of phenotypic expression termed J wave syndromes. Despite 
over 25 years of intensive research, risk stratification and the approach to 
therapy of these two inherited cardiac arrhythmia syndromes are still rapidly 
evolving. Our objective in this review is to provide an integrated synopsis of 
the clinical characteristics, risk stratifiers, as well as the molecular, ionic, 
cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying these two syndromes that have 
captured the interest and attention of the cardiology community over the past 
two decades.
