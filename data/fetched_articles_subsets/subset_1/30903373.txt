Hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia is a rare autosomal recessive 
disorder which manifests in early infancy with generalized seizures, other 
symptoms of neuromuscular irritability, and growth disturbances. Homozygous 
mutations in the magnesium transporter gene, transient receptor potential 
melastatin 6 (TRPM6), cause the disease. Here, we present an 8-month-old Turkish 
boy with a novel mutation of TRPM6. The patient, son of first-degree cousins, 
was hospitalized because of recurrent seizures and mild hypotonia. He had 
seizures since the newborn period and he had been treated with phenobarbital but 
there was no favorable response to therapy. His past history also revealed 
hypocalcemia detected on the newborn period but serum magnesium levels were not 
studied at that time. During hospitalization, we detected hypocalcemia, 
hypomagnesemia, and normal parathormone levels. Abdominal ultrasound was normal. 
Magnesium excretion was slightly increased. Considering the consanguinity of the 
parents and clinical features of the patients, genetic testing of the TRPM6 gene 
was performed and a novel homozygous mutation was detected as c.3178A>T. He was 
started on magnesium and calcium supplementation and he is symptom-free for 
1 year. We would like to call attention to the measurement of serum magnesium 
levels in children with hypocalcemic convulsions. Early and appropriate 
treatment with magnesium supplementation is crucial.
