The Shelterin complex associates with telomeres and plays an essential role in 
telomere protection and telomerase regulation. In its most abundant form, the 
complex is composed of six core components: TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN2, TPP1 and 
RAP1. Of these subunits, three can interact directly with either single-stranded 
(POT1) or double-stranded (TRF1, TRF2) telomeric DNA. In this report, we have 
developed assays to measure the DNA binding activity of Shelterin complexes in 
human cell extracts. With these assays, we have characterized the composition 
and DNA binding specificity of two Shelterin complexes: a 6-member complex that 
contains all six core components and a second complex that lacks TRF1. Our 
results show that both of these complexes bind with high affinity (K(D) = 
1.3-1.5 Ã— 10(-9) M) and selectively to ds/ss-DNA junctions that carry both a 
binding site for POT1 (ss-TTAGGGTTAG) and a binding site for the SANT/Myb domain 
of TRF1 or TRF2 (ds-TTAGGGTTA). This DNA binding specificity suggests the 
preferential recruitment of these complexes to areas of the telomere where ss- 
and ds-DNA are in close proximity, such as the 3'-telomeric overhang, telomeric 
DNA bubbles and the D-loop at the base of T-loops.
