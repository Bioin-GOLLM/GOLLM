BACKGROUND: Although China accounts for 7.8% of worldwide new prostate cancer 
(PCa) cases and 14.5% of new deaths according to GLOBOCAN 2020, the risk of PCa 
associated with germline mutations is poorly defined, hampered in part by lack 
of nationwide evidence. Here, we sequenced 19 PCa predisposition genes in 1,836 
Chinese patients with PCa and estimated disease risk associated with inherited 
mutations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from 4 tertiary cancer centers 
(n=1,160) and a commercial laboratory (n=676). Germline DNA was sequenced using 
a multigene panel, and pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutation frequencies 
in patients with PCa were compared with populations from the gnomAD (Genome 
Aggregation Database) and ChinaMAP (China Metabolic Analytics Project) 
databases. Clinical characteristics and progression-free survival were assessed 
by mutation status.
RESULTS: Of 1,160 patients from hospitals, 89.7% had Gleason scores â‰¥8, and 
65.6% had metastases. P/LP mutations were identified in 8.49% of Chinese 
patients with PCa. Association with PCa risk was significant for mutations in 
ATM (odds ratio [OR], 5.9; 95% CI, 3.1-11.1), BRCA2 (OR, 15.3; 95% CI, 
10.0-23.2), MSH2 (OR, 15.8; 95% CI, 4.2-59.6), and PALB2 (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 
2.7-13.2). Compared with those without mutations, patients with mutations in 
ATM, BRCA2, MSH2, or PALB2 showed a poor outcome with treatment using androgen 
deprivation therapy and abiraterone (hazard ratio, 2.19 [95% CI, 1.34-3.58] and 
2.47 [95% CI, 1.23-4.96], respectively) but similar benefit from docetaxel.
CONCLUSIONS: The present multicenter study confirmed that a significant 
proportion of Chinese patients with PCa had inherited mutations and identified 
predisposition genes in this underreported ethnicity. These data provide 
empirical evidence for precision prevention and prognostic estimation in Chinese 
patients with PCa.
