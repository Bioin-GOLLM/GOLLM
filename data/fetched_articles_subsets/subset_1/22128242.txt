PURPOSE: Acute anterior uveitis (AAU) is the most common form of uveitis; 
however, while it is presumed to have an immunological basis, the precise 
underlying etiology remains elusive. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have a key role 
in linking innate and adaptive immunity, thereby forming a molecular bridge 
between microbial triggers and the development of AAU. The purpose of this study 
was to investigate the role of TLR2 and TLR4 gene polymorphisms in the 
pathogenesis of AAU.
METHODS: The study comprised 225 confirmed cases of idiopathic or human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27 (subtypes B*2701-2759; HLA-B27)-related AAU and 
2,534 population-based controls from the Blue Mountains Eye Study. All 
participants were of Anglo-Celtic descent. Blood samples were collected for DNA 
extraction and genotyping. A total of 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
were selected for analysis and either directly genotyped or imputed to cover the 
common variations within the TLR genes. Data were analyzed at the allelic, 
genotypic and haplotypic levels.
RESULTS: Control subjects were significantly older than case subjects 
(p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in the gender composition 
between the case and control cohorts (p=0.18). One TLR2 SNP (rs11938228) was 
found to be associated with AAU at the allelic level (OR=1.28; p=0.017); however 
this association did not remain following adjustment for age and sex (p=0.067). 
None of the SNPs at the TLR4 locus were found to differ significantly between 
cases or controls, irrespective of adjustment for age and gender.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has confirmed that common TLR variants of moderate 
effect size do not predispose to AAU, undermining the implication of reported 
mutations in the selective perturbations of TLR expression and function evident 
in AAU.
