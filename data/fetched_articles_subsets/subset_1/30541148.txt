Ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is a key factor 
activated by DNA damage and replication stress. An alternative pathway for ATR 
activation has been proposed to occur via stalled RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). 
However, how RNAPII might signal to activate ATR remains unknown. Here, we show 
that ATR signaling is increased after depletion of the RNAPII phosphatase 
PNUTS-PP1, which dephosphorylates RNAPII in its carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). 
High ATR signaling was observed in the absence and presence of ionizing 
radiation, replication stress and even in G1, but did not correlate with DNA 
damage or RPA chromatin loading. R-loops were enhanced, but overexpression of 
EGFP-RNaseH1 only slightly reduced ATR signaling after PNUTS depletion. However, 
CDC73, which interacted with RNAPII in a phospho-CTD dependent manner, was 
required for the high ATR signaling, R-loop formation and for activation of the 
endogenous G2 checkpoint after depletion of PNUTS. In addition, ATR, RNAPII and 
CDC73 co-immunoprecipitated. Our results suggest a novel pathway involving 
RNAPII, CDC73 and PNUTS-PP1 in ATR signaling and give new insight into the 
diverse functions of ATR.
