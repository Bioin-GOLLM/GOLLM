Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) is implicated in the 
tumor progression and prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but the 
detailed regulatory mechanism of TNFAIP8 in cisplatin tolerance in TNBC has not 
yet been investigated. TNFAIP8 was evidently upregulated in TNBC tumor tissues 
and cell lines. Knocking down TNFAIP8 led to impaired proliferation and elevated 
apoptosis of TNBC cells upon cisplatin (DDP) treatment. Mechanistic studies 
revealed that TNFAIP8 repressed the expression of p53 and p53-promoted microRNA 
(miR)-205-5p; moreover, miR-205-5p targeted multiple genes required for the cell 
cycle and repressed Akt phosphorylation, which thus inhibited the proliferation 
of TNBC cells. In addition, silencing of TNFAIP8 led to the upregulation of 
miR-205-5p and the restraint of the TRAF2-NF-κB pathway, which thus enhanced the 
suppressive effects of DDP on tumor growth in nude mice. This study revealed 
that TNFAIP8 was essential in the DDP tolerance formation of TNBC cells by 
reducing p53-promoted miR-205-5p expression. Thus, targeting TNFAIP8 might 
become a promising strategy to suppress TNBC progression.
