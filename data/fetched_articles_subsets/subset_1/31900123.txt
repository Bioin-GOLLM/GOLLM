BACKGROUND: Liquid biopsies of blood plasma cell free DNA can be used to monitor 
treatment response and potentially detect mutations that are present in 
resistant clones in metastatic cancer patients.
CASE PRESENTATION: In our non-interventional liquid biopsy study, a male patient 
in his fifties diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer and polytope liver 
metastases rapidly progressed after completing chemotherapy and deceased 
8 months after diagnosis. Retrospective cell free DNA testing showed that the 
APC/TP53/KRAS major clone responded quickly after 3 cycles of FOLFIRI + 
Bevacizumab. Retrospective exome sequencing of pre-chemotherapy and 
post-chemotherapy tissue samples including metastases confirmed that the 
APC/TP53/KRAS and other major clonal mutations (GPR50, SLC5A, ZIC3, SF3A1 and 
others) were present in all samples. After the last chemotherapy cycle, CT 
imaging, CEA and CA19-9 markers validated the cfDNA findings of treatment 
response. However, 5 weeks later, the tumour had rapidly progressed.
CONCLUSION: As FOLFIRI+Bevacizumab has recently also been associated with 
sustained complete remission in a APC/TP53/KRAS triple-mutated patient, these 
driver genes should be tested and monitored in a more in-depth manner in future 
patients. Patients with metastatic disease should be monitored more closely 
during and after chemotherapy, ideally using cfDNA.
