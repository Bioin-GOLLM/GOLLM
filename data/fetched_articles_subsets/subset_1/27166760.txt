Contactin genes CNTN5 and CNTN6 code for neuronal cell adhesion molecules that 
promote neurite outgrowth in sensory-motor neuronal pathways. Mutations of CNTN5 
and CNTN6 have previously been reported in individuals with autism spectrum 
disorders (ASDs), but very little is known on their prevalence and clinical 
impact. In this study, we identified CNTN5 and CNTN6 deleterious variants in 
individuals with ASD. Among the carriers, a girl with ASD and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was carrying five copies of CNTN5. For 
CNTN6, both deletions (6/1534 ASD vs 1/8936 controls; P=0.00006) and private 
coding sequence variants (18/501 ASD vs 535/33480 controls; P=0.0005) were 
enriched in individuals with ASD. Among the rare CNTN6 variants, two deletions 
were transmitted by fathers diagnosed with ASD, one stop mutation CNTN6W923X was 
transmitted by a mother to her two sons with ASD and one variant CNTN6P770L was 
found de novo in a boy with ASD. Clinical investigations of the patients 
carrying CNTN5 or CNTN6 variants showed that they were hypersensitive to sounds 
(a condition called hyperacusis) and displayed changes in wave latency within 
the auditory pathway. These results reinforce the hypothesis of abnormal 
neuronal connectivity in the pathophysiology of ASD and shed new light on the 
genes that increase risk for abnormal sensory perception in ASD.
