OBJECTIVE: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies in systemic sclerosis (SSc) 
patients of European American (EA) ancestry have identified variants in the 
ATP8B4 gene and enrichment of variants in genes in the extracellular matrix 
(ECM)-related pathway that increase SSc susceptibility. This study was 
undertaken to evaluate the association of the ATP8B4 gene and the ECM-related 
pathway with SSc in a cohort of African American (AA) patients.
METHODS: SSc patients of AA ancestry were enrolled from 23 academic centers 
across the US under the Genome Research in African American Scleroderma Patients 
consortium. Unrelated AA individuals without serologic evidence of autoimmunity 
who were enrolled in the Howard University Family Study were used as unaffected 
controls. Functional variants in genes reported in the 2 WES studies in EA 
patients with SSc were selected for gene association testing using the optimized 
sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O) and pathway analysis by Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis in 379 patients and 411 controls.
RESULTS: Principal components analysis demonstrated that the patients and 
controls had similar ancestral backgrounds, with roughly equal proportions of 
mean European admixture. Using SKAT-O, we examined the association of individual 
genes that were previously reported in EA patients and none remained 
significant, including ATP8B4 (P = 0.98). However, we confirmed the previously 
reported association of the ECM-related pathway with enrichment of variants 
within the COL13A1, COL18A1, COL22A1, COL4A3, COL4A4, COL5A2, PROK1, and 
SERPINE1 genes (corrected P = 1.95 × 10-4 ).
CONCLUSION: In the largest genetic study in AA patients with SSc to date, our 
findings corroborate the role of functional variants that aggregate in a 
fibrotic pathway and increase SSc susceptibility.
