Receptor-like tyrosine kinase (RYK) functions as a transmembrane receptor for 
the Wnt family of secreted protein ligands. Although RYK undergoes endocytosis 
in response to Wnt, the mechanisms that regulate its internalization and 
concomitant activation of Wnt signaling are unknown. We discovered that RYK both 
physically and functionally interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb 1 
(MIB1). Overexpression of MIB1 promotes the ubiquitination of RYK and reduces 
its steady-state levels at the plasma membrane. Moreover, we show that MIB1 is 
sufficient to activate Wnt/β-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling and that this activity 
depends on endogenous RYK. Conversely, in loss-of-function studies, both RYK and 
MIB1 are required for Wnt-3A-mediated activation of CTNNB1. Finally, we identify 
the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of MIB1 and demonstrate a genetic 
interaction between ceMIB and lin-18/RYK in vulva development. These findings 
provide insights into the mechanisms of Wnt/RYK signaling and point to novel 
targets for the modulation of Wnt signaling.
