ScPif1 DNA helicase is the prototypical member of a 5'-to-3' helicase 
superfamily conserved from bacteria to human and plays various roles in the 
maintenance of genomic homeostasis. While many studies have been performed with 
eukaryotic Pif1 helicases, including yeast and human Pif1 proteins, the 
potential functions and biochemical properties of prokaryotic Pif1 helicases 
remain largely unknown. Here, we report the expression, purification and 
biochemical analysis of Pif1 helicase from Bacteroides sp. 3_1_23 (BsPif1). 
BsPif1 binds to a large panel of DNA substrates and, in particular, efficiently 
unwinds partial duplex DNAs with 5'-overhang, fork-like substrates, D-loop and 
flap-like substrates, suggesting that BsPif1 may act at stalled DNA replication 
forks and enhance Okazaki fragment maturation. Like its eukaryotic homologues, 
BsPif1 resolves R-loop structures and unwinds DNA-RNA hybrids. Furthermore, 
BsPif1 efficiently unfolds G-quadruplexes and disrupts nucleoprotein complexes. 
Altogether, these results highlight that prokaryotic Pif1 helicases may resolve 
common issues that arise during DNA transactions. Interestingly, we found that 
BsPif1 is different from yeast Pif1, but resembles more human Pif1 with regard 
to substrate specificity, helicase activity and mode of action. These findings 
are discussed in the context of the possible functions of prokaryotic Pif1 
helicases in vivo.
