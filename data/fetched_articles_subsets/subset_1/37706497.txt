Autosomal dominant sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy is a rare disease caused by 
pathogenic variants of CHRNB2, CHRNA4, and CHRNA2 genes, with nocturnal frontal 
lobe epilepsy as the main symptoms. Syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) gene 
mutation can cause developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 4, mainly 
presenting as a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. We performed the 
exome-targeted next-generation sequencing in our patient and identified two 
heterozygous variants: c.963 + 2T>C of STXBP1 and c.520_527delinsTGCTAC 
(p.R174Cfs*16) of CHRNB2. Molecular analysis was performed of the variant 
c.963 + 2T>C. Aberrantly spliced products were observed, proving the 
pathogenicity of this variant. Refractory seizures and developmental delay could 
be explained. Although the variant c.520_527delinsTGCTAC could cause the 
truncation of the proteins, it was ultimately determined to be nonpathogenic. 
The startle-like responses that occurred occasionally during the night were 
ultimately determined to be an uncommon phenotype caused by the STXBP1 variant.
