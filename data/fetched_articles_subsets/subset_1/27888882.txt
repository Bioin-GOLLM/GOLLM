Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is a challenging subtypes of 
aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Emerging clinical data suggest that optimized 
outcomes are achieved with dose-intensive CNS-penetrant chemotherapy and 
avoiding whole brain radiotherapy. Anti-CD20 antibody-based immunotherapy as a 
component of high-dose methotrexate-based induction programs may contribute to 
improved outcomes. An accumulation of insights into the molecular and cellular 
basis of disease pathogenesis is providing a foundation for the generation of 
molecular tools to facilitate diagnosis as well as a roadmap for integration of 
targeted therapy within the developing therapeutic armamentarium for this 
challenging brain tumor.
