Three new phomoxanthone compounds, phomolactonexanthones A (1), B (2) and 
deacetylphomoxanthone C (3), along with five known phomoxanthones, including 
dicerandrol A (4), dicerandrol B (5), dicerandrol (6), deacetylphomoxanthone B 
(7) and penexanthone A (8), were isolated in the metabolites of the fungus 
Phomopsis sp. HNY29-2B, which was isolated from the mangrove plants. The 
structures of compounds 1-3 were established on the basis of spectroscopic 
analysis. All compounds were evaluated against four human cancer cell lines 
including human breast MDA-MB-435, human colon HCT-116, human lung Calu-3 and 
human liver Huh7 by MTT assay. The compounds 4, 5, 7 and 8 showed cytotoxic 
activities against tested cancer cell lines (IC₅₀ < 10 μM).
