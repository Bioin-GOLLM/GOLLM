BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) is a member of the 
C subfamily of the ABC family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. MRP4 
regulates ATP-dependent efflux of various organic anionic substrates and bile 
acids out of cells. Since Clonorchis sinensis lives in host's bile duct, 
accumulation of bile juice can be toxic to the worm's tissues and cells. 
Therefore, C. sinensis needs bile transporters to reduce accumulation of bile 
acids within its body.
RESULTS: We cloned MRP4 (CsMRP4) from C. sinensis and obtained a cDNA encoding 
an open reading frame of 1469 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 
CsMRP4 belonged to the MRP/SUR/CFTR subfamily. A tertiary structure of CsMRP4 
was generated by homology modeling based on multiple structures of MRP1 and 
P-glycoprotein. CsMRP4 had two membrane-spanning domains (MSD1 & 2) and two 
nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 & 2) as common structural folds. Docking 
simulation with nine bile acids showed that CsMRP4 transports bile acids through 
the inner cavity. Moreover, it was found that CsMRP4 mRNA was more abundant in 
the metacercariae than in the adults. Mouse immune serum, generated against the 
CsMRP4-NBD1 (24.9 kDa) fragment, localized CsMRP4 mainly in mesenchymal tissues 
and oral and ventral suckers of the metacercariae and the adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed new light on MRPs and their homologs and provide 
a platform for further structural and functional investigations on the bile 
transporters and parasites' survival.
