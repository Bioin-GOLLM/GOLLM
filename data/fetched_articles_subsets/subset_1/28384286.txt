BACKGROUND: Mechanical stress, including blood pressure related factors, 
up-regulate expression of the pro-angiogenic extracellular matrix protein 
tenascin-C in skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that increased capillarization of 
skeletal muscle with the repeated augmentation in perfusion during endurance 
training is associated with blood vessel-related expression of tenascin-C and 
would be affected by the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2104772, which 
characterizes the non-synonymous exchange of thymidine (T)-to-adenosine (A) in 
the amino acid codon 1677 of tenascin-C.
METHODS: Sixty-one healthy, untrained, male white participants of Swiss descent 
performed thirty 30-min bouts of endurance exercise on consecutive weekdays 
using a cycling ergometer. Genotype and training interactions were called 
significant at Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5% (repeated measures ANOVA).
RESULTS: Endurance training increased capillary-to-fiber-ratio (+11%), capillary 
density (+7%), and mitochondrial volume density (+30%) in m. vastus lateralis. 
Tenascin-C protein expression in this muscle was confined to arterioles and 
venules (80% of cases) and increased after training in A-allele carriers. Prior 
to training, volume densities of subsarcolemmal and myofibrillar mitochondria in 
m. vastus lateralis muscle were 49% and 18%, respectively, higher in A/A 
homozygotes relative to T-nucleotide carriers (A/T and T/T). Training 
specifically increased capillary-to-fiber ratio in A-nucleotide carriers but not 
in T/T homozygotes. Genotype specific regulation of angiogenesis was reflected 
by the expression response of 8 angiogenesis-associated transcripts after 
exercise, and confirmed by training-induced alterations of the shear stress 
related factors, vimentin and VEGF A.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence for a negative influence of T/T 
homozygosity in rs2104772 on capillary remodeling with endurance exercise.
