Rwanda was the first low-income African country to introduce RotaTeq vaccine 
into its Expanded Programme on Immunization in May 2012. To gain insights into 
the overall genetic make-up and evolution of Rwandan G1P[8] strains pre- and 
post-vaccine introduction, rotavirus positive fecal samples collected between 
2011 and 2016 from children under the age of 5 years as part of ongoing 
surveillance were genotyped with conventional RT-PCR based methods and whole 
genome sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. From a pool of samples 
sequenced (n = 158), 36 were identified as G1P[8] strains (10 pre-vaccine and 26 
post-vaccine), of which 35 exhibited a typical Wa-like genome constellation. 
However, one post vaccine strain, 
RVA/Human-wt/RWA/UFS-NGS:MRC-DPRU442/2012/G1P[8], exhibited a RotaTeq vaccine 
strain constellation of G1-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3, with most of the 
gene segments having a close relationship with a vaccine derived reassortant 
strain, previously reported in USA in 2010 and Australia in 2012. The study 
strains segregated into two lineages, each containing a paraphyletic pre- and 
post-vaccine introduction sub-lineages. In addition, the study strains 
demonstrated close relationship amongst each other when compared with globally 
selected group A rotavirus (RVA) G1P[8] reference strains. For VP7 
neutralization epitopes, amino acid substitutions observed at positions T91A/V, 
S195D and M217T in relation to the RotaTeq vaccine were radical in nature and 
resulted in a change in polarity from a polar to non-polar molecule, while for 
the VP4, amino acid differences at position D195G was radical in nature and 
resulted in a change in polarity from a polar to non-polar molecule. The 
polarity change at position T91A/V of the neutralizing antigens might play a 
role in generating vaccine-escape mutants, while substitutions at positions 
S195D and M217T may be due to natural fluctuation of the RVA. Surveillance of 
RVA at whole genome level will enhance further assessment of vaccine impact on 
circulating strains, the frequency of reassortment events under natural 
conditions and epidemiological fitness generated by such events.
