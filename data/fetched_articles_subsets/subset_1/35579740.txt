A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or severe acute respiratory 
syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transmitted from person to person, 
has quickly emerged as the pandemic responsible for the current global health 
crisis. This infection has been declared a global pandemic, resulting in a 
concerning number of deaths as well as complications post-infection, primarily 
among vulnerable groups particularly older people and those with multiple 
comorbidities. In this article, we review the most recent research on the role 
of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) fruits (DPFs) to prevent or treat COVID-19 
infection. The mechanisms underlying this preventive or therapeutic effect are 
also discussed in terms of bioactivity potentials in date palm, e.g., 
antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, 
neuroprotective, and hemolytic potential, as well as prospect against COVID-19 
disease and the potential product development. Therefore, it can be concluded 
that regular consumption of DPFs may be associated with a lower risk of some 
chronic diseases. Indeed, DPFs have been widely used in folk medicine since 
ancient times to treat a variety of health conditions, demonstrating the 
importance of DPFs as a nutraceutical and source of functional nourishment. This 
comprehensive review aims to summarize the majority of the research on DPFs in 
terms of nutrient content and biologically active components such as phenolic 
compounds, with an emphasis on their roles in improving overall health as well 
as the potential product development to ensure consumers' satisfaction in a 
current pandemic situation. In conclusion, DPFs can be given to COVID-19 
patients as a safe and effective add-on medication or supplement in addition to 
routine treatments.
