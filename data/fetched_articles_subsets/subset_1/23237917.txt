G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are targeted by ∼30-40% of marketed drugs, 
and their key roles in normal physiology and in disease demonstrate that an 
understanding of their structure and function is valuable to researchers in both 
basic science and drug discovery. However, until recently, detailed structural 
information on this protein family was limited by challenges in X-ray 
crystallographic analysis of such membrane proteins. The GPCR Network was 
created in 2010 with the goal of structurally characterizing 15-25 
representative human GPCRs within 5 years, based on an active outreach programme 
addressing an interdisciplinary community of scientists interested in GPCR 
structure, chemistry and biology. Here, we provide an overview of how this 
collaborative effort has enabled the structural determination and 
characterization of eight human GPCRs so far, and discuss some of the challenges 
that remain in gaining more detailed insights into structure-function 
relationships in this receptor superfamily.
