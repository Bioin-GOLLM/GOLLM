PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Treatment goals and ambitions have even been upwardly revised 
since demonstration was made that under certain conditions, treatment-free 
remission was possible. Herein, we will discuss on how to try tailoring 
treatment choices to the unique characteristics of each patient.
RECENT FINDINGS: Since the first-generation ATP-competitive TKI imatinib was 
made available in the clinic in 2001, second-generation drugs such as dasatinib, 
nilotinib and bosutinib and the third-generation TKI ponatinib have broadened 
the therapeutic armamentarium, providing effective salvage against intolerance 
and different types of resistance, or as frontline options. Management and 
outcomes of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia have been revolutionized by 
the discovery, development, and approval of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs). Most patients can now expect a near-to normal life expectancy and 
acceptable quality of life on life-long treatment, providing awareness and 
avoidance of harmful adverse events, which depend on each TKI safety profile and 
patient personal background.
