Pediatric cone-rod dystrophies are a genetically heterogenous group of disorders 
characterized by photophobia, progressive loss of central vision, and subsequent 
gradual loss of peripheral vision. In general, clinical presentation is not 
specific for a particular gene mutation; however, there are exceptions, which 
are important to recognize in order to facilitate molecular diagnosis. In this 
report, we highlight that pediatric cone-rod dystrophy with high myopia and 
nystagmus suggests recessive mutations in the gene PROM1.
