BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is expected to become a kind of new diagnosis and 
treatment method of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroinflammation- and 
immune-related pathways represent one of the major genetic risk factors for AD.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate DNA methylation levels of 7 key 
immunologic-related genes in peripheral blood and appraise their applicability 
in the diagnosis of AD.
METHODS: Methylation levels were obtained from 222 participants (101 AD, 72 MCI, 
49 non-cognitively impaired controls). Logistic regression models for diagnosing 
AD were established after least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO) and best subset selection (BSS), evaluated by respondent working curve 
and decision curve analysis for sensitivity.
RESULTS: Six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in the MCI group and 64 
in the AD group were found, respectively. Among them, there were 2 DMPs in the 
MCI group and 30 DMPs in the AD group independent of age, gender, and APOE4 
carriers (p <  0.05). AD diagnostic prediction models differentiated AD from 
normal controls both in a training dataset (LASSO: 8 markers, including 
methylation levels at ABCA7 1040077, CNR1 88166293, CX3CR1 39322324, LRRK2 
40618505, LRRK2 40618493, NGFR 49496745, TARDBP 11070956, TARDBP 11070840 area 
under the curve [AUC] = 0.81; BSS: 2 markers, including methylation levels at 
ABCA7 1040077 and CX3CR1 39322324, AUC = 0.80) and a testing dataset 
(AUC = 0.84, AUC = 0.82, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our work indicated that methylation levels of 7 key 
immunologic-related genes (ABCA7, CNR1, CX3CR1, CSF1R, LRRK2, NGFR, and TARDBP) 
in peripheral blood was altered in AD and the models including methylation of 
immunologic-related genes biomarkers improved prediction of AD.
