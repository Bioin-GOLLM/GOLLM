AIMS: Alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a clinically under-diagnosed 
genetic disorder that originates from deleterious mutations in the 
alpha(1)-antitrypsin (AAT) gene, SERPINA1. Severe deficiency is associated with 
significant pulmonary and hepatic malfunctions. Conventional clinical diagnosis 
involves the evaluation of serum AAT level and detection of diseased protein 
isoforms. In this communication, we describe the investigations of a case of 
severe AATD in which the AAT levels were well below those expected from the MZ 
phenotype determined by isoelectric focusing for protease inhibitor type (IEF 
PI-typing).
METHODS: In addition to the traditional diagnostic method that combines the 
assessment of serum AAT concentration and IEF PI-typing, we investigated the 
SERPINA1 gene of the proband and participating family members for mutations 
using Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: We identified a novel mutation (M409T) in the proband, initially missed 
by the standard diagnostic approach. The novel mutation was present in 4 out of 
8 family members who participated in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: This report illustrates the diagnostic value of incorporating exon 
sequencing of the AAT gene into the algorithm for evaluating AATD, particularly 
when the AAT serum level is significantly lower than expected from IEF 
PI-typing.
