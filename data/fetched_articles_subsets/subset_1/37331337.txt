BACKGROUND: Mutations in TMPRSS3 are an important cause of autosomal recessive 
non-syndromic hearing loss. The hearing loss associated with mutations in 
TMPRSS3 is characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity, ranging from mild to 
profound hearing loss, and is generally progressive. Clinical presentation and 
natural history of TMPRSS3 mutations vary significantly based on the location 
and type of mutation in the gene. Understanding these genotype-phenotype 
relationships and associated natural disease histories is necessary for the 
successful development and application of gene-based therapies and precision 
medicine approaches to DFNB8/10. The heterogeneous presentation of 
TMPRSS3-associated disease makes it difficult to identify patients clinically. 
As the body of literature on TMPRSS3-associated deafness grows, there is need 
for better categorization of the hearing phenotypes associated with specific 
mutations in the gene.
SUMMARY: In this review, we summarize TMPRSS3 genotype-phenotype relationships 
including a thorough description of the natural history of patients with 
TMPRSS3-associated hearing loss to lay the groundwork for the future of TMPRSS3 
treatment using molecular therapy.
KEY MESSAGES: TMPRSS3 mutation is a significant cause of genetic hearing loss. 
All patients with TMPRSS3 mutation display severe-to-profound prelingual 
(DFNB10) or a postlingual (DFNB8) progressive sensorineural hearing loss. 
Importantly, TMPRSS3 mutations have not been associated with middle ear or 
vestibular deficits. The c.916G&gt;A (p.Ala306Thr) missense mutation is the most 
frequently reported mutation across populations and should be further explored 
as a target for molecular therapy.
