OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of osimertinib combined with pulmonary 
rehabilitation and health care training on pulmonary function, complications, 
and the quality of life (QOL) in patients after radical resection of lung 
cancer.
METHODS: The data of 120 patients with radical resection of lung cancer admitted 
to The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from February 2020 to 
February 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the order of 
admission, they were equally divided into group p and group q. All patients were 
given pulmonary rehabilitation and health care training, and group p was treated 
with osimertinib, while group q received the treatment of pemetrexed combined 
with cisplatin. The pulmonary function, the incidence of complications, and QOL 
between the two groups were compared.
RESULTS: Compared with group q, the pulmonary function was higher (P < 0.001), 
the incidence of complications was significantly lower (P < 0.05), and QOL 
scores were markedly higher in group p after treatment (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The combination of osimertinib and pulmonary rehabilitation and 
health care training can improve the pulmonary function of patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with radical resection of lung cancer, and 
reduce their postoperative morbidity, thereby improving their QOL, which is 
conducive to reducing the patient's and society's medical burden.
