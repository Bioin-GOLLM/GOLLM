Tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutation predicts an unfavorable prognosis in diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but the molecular basis for this association 
remains unclear. In several malignancies, the cytidine deaminase apolipoprotein 
B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) has been reported to be 
associated with the TP53 G/C-to-A/T mutation. Here, we show that the frequency 
of this mutation was significantly higher in relapsed/refractory (R/R) than in 
non-R/R DLBCL, which was positively associated with the APOBEC3B expression 
level. APOBEC3B overexpression induced the TP53 G/C-to-A/T mutation in vitro, 
resulting in a phenotype similar to that of DLBCL specimens. Additionally, 
APOBEC3B-induced p53 mutants promoted the growth of DLBCL cells and enhanced 
drug resistance. These results suggest that APOBEC3B is a critical factor in 
mutant p53-driven R/R DLBCL and is therefore a potential therapeutic target.
