BACKGROUND: HIV-1 is characterized by its rapid genetic evolution and high 
diversity as a consequence of its error-prone reverse transcriptase and genetic 
recombination. This latter mechanism is responsible for the creation of 
circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) found in nature. Previous studies from our 
lab group have shown that the epidemic in Argentina is characterized by one 
highly prevalent circulating recombinant form, CRF12_BF, and many related BF 
recombinant forms. Since transcriptional transactivation of the HIV-1 long 
terminal repeat (LTR) promoter element requires the essential viral Tat protein, 
since these genetic structures underwent recombination in variants widely spread 
in South America, the aim of this work was to study transcriptional activity 
associated with the recombinant LTR and Tat elements.
RESULTS: Differential transcriptional activity was measured for the BF 
recombinant LTR/Tat complex that is present in widely spread viral variants was 
demonstrated. This analysis demonstrated a higher activity for the BF complex 
when compared to its B subtype counterpart.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates structural and functional consequences of 
recombination events within the LTR promoter and Tat transactivator protein of a 
naturally occurring HIV-1 recombinant form.
