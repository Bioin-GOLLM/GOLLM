Parasitic helminths infecting humans are highly prevalent infecting ∼2 billion 
people worldwide, causing inflammatory responses, malnutrition and anemia that 
are the primary cause of morbidity. In addition, helminth infections of cattle 
have a significant economic impact on livestock production, milk yield and 
fertility. The etiological agents of helminth infections are mainly Nematodes 
(roundworms) and Platyhelminths (flatworms). G-quadruplexes (G4) are unusual 
nucleic acid structures formed by G-rich sequences that can be recognized by 
specific G4 ligands. Here we used the G4Hunter Web Tool to identify and compare 
potential G4 sequences (PQS) in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of various 
helminths to identify G4 ligand targets. PQS are nonrandomly distributed in 
these genomes and often located in the proximity of genes. Unexpectedly, a 
Nematode, Ascaris lumbricoides, was found to be highly enriched in stable PQS. 
This species can tolerate high-stability G4 structures, which are not counter 
selected at all, in stark contrast to most other species. We experimentally 
confirmed G4 formation for sequences found in four different parasitic 
helminths. Small molecules able to selectively recognize G4 were found to bind 
to Schistosoma mansoni G4 motifs. Two of these ligands demonstrated potent 
activity both against larval and adult stages of this parasite.
