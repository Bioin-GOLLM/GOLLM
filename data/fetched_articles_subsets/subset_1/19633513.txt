BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) has not been 
established using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction techniques in 
a specimen collection that spans decades.
METHODS: We used real-time RT-PCR for 3 HCoVs, HCoV 229E, OC43, and NL63, to 
test nasal wash specimens that had been obtained from a cohort of children <5 
years of age with upper or lower respiratory infection (URI, LRI) who were 
comprehensively followed during the period from 1977 to 2001. Prospectively 
collected clinical data and archival samples were analyzed.
RESULTS: HCoV was detected in 92/1854 (5.0%) of available samples with no known 
viral etiology of which 9% were 229E, 59% OC43, and 33% NL63. This represented 
10/119 (8.4%) of LRI samples and 82/1735 (4.7%) of URI samples. HCoV was not 
detected every year, but occurred episodically. The recently described HCoV-NL63 
was detected as early as 1981. HCoV was associated with 11.4 LRI episodes/1000 
child-years <5 years of age (all in children <2 years of age) and 67.3 URI 
episodes/1000 child-years <5 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: HCoV-NL63 and OC43 are associated with a significant proportion of 
LRI in children less than 2 years of age and a substantial number of medically 
attended URI episodes.
