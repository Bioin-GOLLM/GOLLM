BACKGROUND: Key regulators of developmental processes can be prioritized through 
integrated analysis of ChIP-Seq data of master transcriptional factors (TFs) 
such as Nanog and Oct4, active histone modifications (HMs) such as H3K4me3 and 
H3K27ac, and repressive HMs such as H3K27me3. Recent studies show that broad 
enrichment signals such as super-enhancers and broad H3K4me3 enrichment signals 
play more dominant roles than short enrichment signals of the master TFs and 
H3K4me3 in epigenetic regulatory mechanism. Besides the broad enrichment 
signals, up to ten thousands of short enrichment signals of these TFs and HMs 
exist in genome. Prioritization of these broad enrichment signals from ChIP-Seq 
data is a prerequisite for such integrated analysis.
RESULTS: Here, we present a method named 
Clustering-Local-Unique-Enriched-Signals (CLUES), which uses an 
adaptive-size-windows strategy to identify enriched regions (ERs) and cluster 
them into broad enrichment signals. Tested on 62 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets of 
Ctcf and Nrsf, CLUES performs equally well as MACS2 regarding prioritization of 
ERs with the TF's motif. Tested on 165 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets of H3K4me3, 
H3K27me3, and H3K36me3, CLUES performs better than existing algorithms on 
prioritizing broad enrichment signals implicating cell functions influenced by 
epigenetic regulatory mechanism in cells. Most importantly, CLUES helps to 
confirm several novel regulators of mouse ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency 
through integrated analysis of prioritized broad enrichment signals of H3K4me3, 
H3K27me3, Nanog and Oct4 with the support of a CRISPR/Cas9 negative selection 
genetic screen.
CONCLUSIONS: CLUES holds promise for prioritizing broad enrichment signals from 
ChIP-Seq data. The download site for CLUES is
