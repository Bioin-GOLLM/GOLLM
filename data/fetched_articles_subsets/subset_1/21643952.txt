In order to determine the influence of polymorphism in thymidylate synthase (TS 
28-bp repeat) and methionine synthase (MS A2756G) genes on the susceptibility to 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 73 children with ALL and 128 age and sex 
matched unrelated healthy individuals from the Kermanshah Province of Iran were 
screened. The genotyping of TS 28-bp repeat and MS A2756G polymorphisms were 
performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-RFLP, respectively. The 
frequency of TS 2R allele in patients and controls were 41.5 and 38%, 
respectively (Odds ratios (OR) = 1.13, 95%CI 0.73-1.74, P = 0.56). The allelic 
frequency of G allele of MS was higher (25%) in patients compared with healthy 
subjects (23%) (OR = 1.09, 95%CI 0.67-1.75, P = 0.71). Considering MS AA and TS 
3R3R genotypes as reference indicated that individuals with MS GG + TS 2R2R 
genotypes have 1.3-fold increase in the risk of ALL (OR = 1.3, 95%CI 0.6-2.7, P 
= 0.5). Our results showed that neither TS 28-bp repeat nor MS A2756G 
polymorphisms are risk factors for susceptibility to ALL in Western Iran.
