BACKGROUND: MYH9-related disease (MYH9-RD) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic 
syndrome characterized by congenital thrombocytopenia associated with the risk 
of developing progressive nephropathy, sensorineural deafness, and presenile 
cataract. During the collection of a large case-series of patients with MYH9-RD 
we noticed several cases with unexplained elevation of liver enzymes. Our aim 
was to evaluate if the alteration of liver tests is a feature of the MYH9-RD and 
to define its clinical significance.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data concerning liver tests, prospectively recorded in the 
Italian Registry for MYH9-RD, were collected and compared with those of three 
control populations: patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia, patients with 
inherited thrombocytopenias other than MYH9-RD, and the participants to a large 
epidemiologic survey in an Italian geographic isolate. Thirty-eight of 75 
evaluable MYH9-RD patients (50.7%) showed an elevation of ALT and/or AST, and 17 
of 63 (27.0%) an increase of GGT. The increases ranged from 1.9 ± 0.7 to 2.7 ± 
1.6 fold the upper normal limit. The prevalence of liver test alterations was 
significantly higher in MYH9-RD patients than in each of the control 
populations, with odds ratios ranging from 8.2 (95% CIs 2.2-44.8) to 24.7 
(14.8-40.8). Clinical follow-up and more detailed liver studies of a subset of 
patients, including ultrasound liver scan, liver elastography and liver biopsy 
in one case, did not show any significant structural damage or evolution towards 
liver insufficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of liver enzymes is a frequent and previously 
unrecognized feature of the MYH9-RD syndrome; however, this defect does not 
appear to have poor prognostic value.
