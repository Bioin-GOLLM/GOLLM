Previous studies have indicated that the protein tyrosine phosphatase 
nonreceptor type 22 gene (PTPN22) is associated with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) in 
the Caucasian population. In the present study, we investigated the relationship 
between PTPN22 genetic polymorphisms and T1DM in Chinese children. A total of 
202 children and adolescents with T1DM and 240 healthy control subjects of 
Chinese Han origin were included in our analysis. Polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to determine the 
presence of the C1858T polymorphism in the PTPN22 gene. We found that the TT +TC 
genotype and the T allele of C1858T were more frequent in T1DM patients (19.40 
and 10.0%, respectively) than in healthy subjects (7.51 and 4.0%, respectively), 
and the difference was significant (both P < 0.001). After adjusting for 
confounding variables such as gender, age, and family history of T1DM, the 
difference remained significant (P = 0.007, odds ratio = 2.88, 95% confidence 
interval 1.76-4.32). Our results indicate that genetic polymorphisms in the 
PTPN22 gene may increase the risk of T1DM in Chinese children and adolescents.
