OBJECTIVE: Time-restricted eating (TRE) restores circadian rhythms in mice, but 
the evidence to support this in humans is limited. The objective of this study 
was to investigate the effects of TRE on 24-hour profiles of plasma metabolites, 
glucoregulatory hormones, and the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) 
transcriptome in humans.
METHODS: Men (n = 15, age = 63 [4] years, BMI 30.5 [2.4] kg/m2 ) were recruited. 
A 35-hour metabolic ward stay was conducted at baseline and after 8 weeks of 
10-hour TRE. Assessment included 24-hour profiles of plasma glucose, 
nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), triglyceride, glucoregulatory hormones, and the 
SAT transcriptome. Dim light melatonin onset and cortisol area under the curve 
were calculated.
RESULTS: TRE did not alter dim light melatonin onset but reduced morning 
cortisol area under the curve. TRE altered 24-hour profiles of insulin, NEFA, 
triglyceride, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and increased 
transcripts of circadian locomotor output cycles protein kaput (CLOCK) and 
nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 2 (NR1D2) and decreased period 
circadian regulator 1 (PER1) and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 
(NR1D1) at 12:00 am. The rhythmicity of 450 genes was altered by TRE, which 
enriched in transcripts for transcription corepressor activity, DNA-binding 
transcription factor binding, regulation of chromatin organization, and small 
GTPase binding pathways. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis revealed 
eigengenes that were correlated with BMI, insulin, and NEFA.
CONCLUSIONS: TRE restored 24-hour profiles in hormones, metabolites, and genes 
controlling transcriptional regulation in SAT, which could underpin its 
metabolic health benefit.
