OBJECTIVES: To screen out the predictors of central cervical lymph node 
metastasis (CLNM) for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and establish a 
prediction model to guide the operation of PTC patients (cN0).
METHODS: Data from 296 PTC patients (cN0) who underwent thyroid operation at the 
Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were collected and 
retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into two groups in accordance with 
central CLNM or not. Their information, including ultrasound (US) features, 
BRAFV600E status, and other characteristics of the two groups, was analyzed and 
compared using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and the 
independent predictors were selected to construct a nomogram. The calibration 
plot, C-index, and decision curve analysis were used to assess the prediction 
model's calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness.
RESULTS: A total of 37.8% (112/296) of PTC patients had central CLNM, and 62.2% 
(184/296) did not. The two groups were compared using a univariate logistic 
regression analysis, and there were no significant differences between the two 
groups in sex, aspect ratio, boundary, morphology, hypoechoic nodule, thyroid 
peroxidase antibody, or tumor location (P>0.05), and there were significant 
differences between age, tumor size, capsule contact, microcalcifications, blood 
flow signal, thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), and BRAF gene status (P<0.05). A 
multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to further clarify the 
correlation of these indices. However, only tumor size (OR=2.814, 95% 
Cl=1.634~4.848, P<0.001), microcalcifications (OR=2.839, 95% Cl=1,684~4.787, 
P<0.001) and TgAb (OR=1.964, 95% Cl=1.039~3,711, P=0.038) were independent 
predictors of central CLNM and were incorporated and used to construct the 
prediction nomogram. The model had good discrimination with a C-index of 0.715. 
An ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the accuracy of this model. The 
decision curve analysis showed that the model was clinically useful when 
intervention was decided in the threshold range of 16% to 80%.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, three independent predictors of central CLNM, 
including tumor size (> 1.0 cm), US features (microcalcifications), and TgAb 
(positive), were screened out. A visualized nomogram model was established based 
on the three predictors in this study, which could be used as a basis of central 
cervical lymph node dissection (CLND) for PTC patients (cN0).
