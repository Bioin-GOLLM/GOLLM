Standard therapeutic approaches of cytotoxics and radiation in cancer are not 
only highly toxic, but also of limited efficacy in treatment of a significant 
number of cancer patients. The molecular analysis of the cancer genomes have 
shown a remarkable complexity and pointed to key genomic and epigenomic 
alterations in cancer. These discoveries are paving the way for targeted therapy 
approaches. However, although there are a large number of potential targets, 
only a few can regulate key cellular functions and intersect multiple signaling 
networks. The Aurora kinase family members (A, B, and C) are a collection of 
highly related and conserved serine-threonine kinases that fulfill these 
criteria, being key regulators of mitosis and multiple signaling pathways. 
Alterations in Aurora kinase signaling are associated with mitotic errors and 
have been closely linked to chromosomal aneuploidy in cancer cells. Several 
studies have shown amplification and/or overexpression of Aurora kinase A and B 
in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Over the past several years, 
Aurora kinases have become attractive targets. Several ongoing clinical trials 
and bench-based research are assessing the unique therapeutic potential of 
Aurora-based targeted therapy.
