Mutations of NANOS1, a human homologue of the Drosophila morphogen, are 
associated with a lack of germ cells in testes or severe 
oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia.

BACKGROUND: The Nanos gene is a key translational regulator of specific mRNAs 
involved in Drosophila germ cell development. Disruption of mammalian 
homologues, Nanos2 or Nanos3, causes male infertility in mice. In humans, 
however, no evidence of NANOS2 or NANOS3 mutations causing male infertility has 
been reported. Although Nanos1 seems dispensable for mouse reproduction, we 
sought to analyse for the first time its homologue in infertile men.
METHODS: A group of 195 patients manifesting non-obstructive azoospermia or 
oligozoospermia were tested for mutations of the NANOS1 gene, using 
single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Three types of NANOS1 gene mutations were identified in five patients 
and were absent in 800 chromosomes of fertile men. Pedigree analysis indicated a 
dominant inheritance pattern with penetration limited to males. Two mutations 
caused deletions of single amino acids, p.Pro77_Ser78delinsPro and p.Ala173del, 
each of them identified in two unrelated patients. Both types of deletions were 
located in the NANOS1 N-terminus (responsible for protein interactions) and were 
associated with a lack of germ cells in testes. Interestingly, the 
Pro77_Ser78delinsPro mutation altered interaction of NANOS1 with a microRNA 
biogenesis factor, GEMIN3. The third identified mutation, p.[(Arg246His; 
Arg276Tyr)], found in the C-terminal RNA-binding domain, was present in a single 
oligo-astheno-teratozoospermic man. We bioinformatically demonstrated that the 
p.Arg246His substitution causes a decrease in the positive charge of this 
domain, potentially altering RNA-binding.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report describing the association of NANOS1 gene 
mutations with human infertility. Two different infertility phenotypes may 
reflect distinct functions of N-terminal versus C-terminal regions of NANOS1.
