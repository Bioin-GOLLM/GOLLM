INTRODUCTION: Genetic epilepsy is a large group of clinically and genetically 
heterogeneous neurological disorders characterized by recurrent seizures, which 
have a clear association with genetic defects. In this study, we have recruited 
seven families from China with neurodevelopmental abnormalities in which 
epilepsy was a predominant manifestation, aiming to elucidate the underlying 
causes and make a precise diagnosis for the cases.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) combined with Sanger sequencing was used 
to identify the causative variants associated with the diseases in addition to 
essential imaging and biomedical examination.
RESULTS: A gross intragenic deletion detected in MFSD8 was investigated via 
gap-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and mRNA 
sequence analysis. We identified 11 variants in seven genes (ALDH7A1, CDKL5, 
PCDH19, QARS1, POLG, GRIN2A, and MFSD8) responsible for genetic epilepsy in the 
seven families, respectively. A total of six variants (c.1408T>G in ALDH7A1, 
c.1994_1997del in CDKL5, c.794G>A in QARS1, c.2453C>T in GRIN2A, and c.217dup 
and c.863+995_998+1480del in MFSD8) have not yet been reported to be associated 
with diseases and were all evaluated to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) 
guidelines.
METHODS: Based on the molecular findings, we have associated the intragenic 
deletion in MFSD8 with the mutagenesis mechanism of Alu-mediated genomic 
rearrangements for the first time and provided genetic counseling, medical 
suggestions, and prenatal diagnosis for the families. In conclusion, molecular 
diagnosis is crucial to obtain improved medical outcomes and recurrence risk 
evaluation for genetic epilepsy.
