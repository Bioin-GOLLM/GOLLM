BACKGROUND: An imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolytic system plays an 
important role in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis. It has been 
identified that elevated plasma thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor 
(TAFI) concentration, an anti-fibrinolytic factor, is associated with an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). But the effect of genetic 
variations in TAFI gene on the risk of CVD is inconclusive.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the associations between two variants 
Ala147Thr(rs3742264) and Thr325Ile(rs1926447) in TAFI and the risk of CVD.
METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of eligible studies published 
before January 2014. Coronary heart disease(CHD) and stroke are regarded as 
end-points of CVD.
RESULTS: A total of 18 articles including 23 studies were enrolled. Among these 
articles were 19 studies of Ala147Thr and 15 of Thr325Ile variants, comprising 
4,977 CVD patients and 8,082 controls together with 4,890 cases and 8,311 
controls, respectively. There were no significant associations between Ala147Thr 
variant and CVD under allele, dominant, recessive genetic models. Similar 
results were observed when end-point, ethnicity, sample size, genotyping method 
were taken into account. Likewise, meta-analysis of Thr325Ile variant did not 
show significant associations with CVD under three genetic models. Nevertheless, 
in sub-analysis based on end-point, the TT(Ile/Ile) genotype was associated with 
a 25% higher risk of coronary heart disease(CHD) (OR=1.25, 95%CI, 1.02-1.54; 
P=0.03) compared with TC+CC(Thr/Ile+Thr/Thr) genotype(recessive model).
CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis failed to confirm the influence of 
Ala147Thr and Thr325Ile variants on the susceptibility to CVD. However, 
potentially increased risk of CHD was detected in Ile325 allele carriers under 
recessive model.
