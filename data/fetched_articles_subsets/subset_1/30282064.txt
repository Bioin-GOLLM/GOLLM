Our aim is to characterize predicted protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in 
MYBPC3, the gene most commonly associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(HCM), found in a series of autopsied HCM cases after sudden unexpected cardiac 
death. All cases underwent death scene investigation, gross and microscopic 
autopsies, toxicological testing, a review of medical records, and a molecular 
analysis of 95 cardiac genes. We found four pathogenic PTVs in MYBPC3 among male 
decedents. All variants were previously submitted to ClinVar without phenotype 
details. Two PTVs were located in the cardiac-specific myosin S2-binding (M) 
motif at the N-terminus of the MYBPC3-encoded cMyBP-C protein, and two PTVs were 
in the non-cardiac-specific C-terminus of the protein. The carriers of two 
cardiac-specific M-motif PTVs died at age 38 years; their heart weight (HW, g) 
and body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) ratio were 34.90 (890/25.5) and 23.56 
(980/41.6), respectively. In contrast, the carriers of two non-cardiac-specific 
C-terminal PTVs died at age 57 and 67 years, respectively; their HW and BMI 
ratio were 14.71 (450/30.6) and 13.98 (600/42.9), respectively. A detailed 
three-generation family study was conducted in one case. This study showed 
age-at-death variations among MYBPC3 PTVs carriers in adult males.
