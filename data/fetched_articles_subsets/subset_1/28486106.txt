Polyploidy can lead to aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. Here, we report that the 
Hippo pathway effector Yap promotes the diploid-polyploid conversion and 
polyploid cell growth through the Akt-Skp2 axis. Yap strongly induces the 
acetyltransferase p300-mediated acetylation of the E3 ligase Skp2 via Akt 
signaling. Acetylated Skp2 is exclusively localized to the cytosol, which causes 
hyper-accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, leading to 
mitotic arrest and subsequently cell polyploidy. In addition, the pro-apoptotic 
factors FoxO1/3 are overly degraded by acetylated Skp2, resulting in polyploid 
cell division, genomic instability, and oncogenesis. Importantly, the depletion 
or inactivation of Akt or Skp2 abrogated Hippo signal deficiency-induced liver 
tumorigenesis, indicating their epistatic interaction. Thus, we conclude that 
Hippo-Yap signaling suppresses cell polyploidy and oncogenesis through Skp2.
