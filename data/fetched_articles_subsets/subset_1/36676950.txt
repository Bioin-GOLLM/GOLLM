Asthma is a complex chronic airway inflammatory disease that seriously impacts 
patients' quality of life. As a novel approach to exploring the pathogenesis of 
diseases, metabolomics provides the potential to identify biomarkers of asthma 
host susceptibility and elucidate biological pathways. The aim of this study was 
to screen potential biomarkers and biological pathways so as to provide possible 
pharmacological therapeutic targets for asthma. In the present study, we merged 
the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of asthma in the GEO database with the 
metabolic genes obtained by Genecard for bioinformatics analysis and 
successfully screened out the metabolism-related hub genes (HIF1A, OCRL, NNMT, 
and PER1). Then, untargeted metabolic techniques were utilized to reveal 
HDM-induced metabolite alterations in 16HBE cells. A total of 45 significant 
differential metabolites and 5 differential metabolic pathways between the 
control group and HDM group were identified based on the OPLS-DA model. Finally, 
three key metabolic pathways, including glycerophospholipid metabolism, 
galactose metabolism, and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, were 
screened through the integrated analysis of bioinformatics data and untargeted 
metabolomics data. Taken together, these findings provide valuable insights into 
the pathophysiology and targeted therapy of asthma and lay a foundation for 
further research.
