Tauopathy refers to a group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease, which correlate with 
the malfunction of microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) due to abnormal 
hyperphosphorylation, leading to the formation of intracellular aggregates in 
the brain. Despite extensive efforts to understand tauopathy and develop an 
efficient therapy, our knowledge is still far from complete. To find a solution 
for this group of devastating diseases, several animal models that mimic diverse 
disease phenotypes of tauopathy have been developed. Rodents are the dominating 
tauopathy models because of their similarity to humans and established disease 
lines, as well as experimental approaches. However, powerful genetic animal 
models using Drosophila, zebrafish, and C. elegans have also been developed for 
modeling tauopathy and have contributed to understanding the pathophysiology of 
tauopathy. The success of these models stems from the short lifespans, versatile 
genetic tools, real-time in-vivo imaging, low maintenance costs, and the 
capability for high-throughput screening. In this review, we summarize the main 
findings on mechanisms of tauopathy and discuss the current tauopathy models of 
these non-rodent genetic animals, highlighting their key advantages and 
limitations in tauopathy research.
