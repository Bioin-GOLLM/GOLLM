OBJECTIVE: High concentrations of leukocytes in blood have been associated with 
diabetes mellitus. This prospective study aimed to explore whether total and 
differential leukocyte counts are associated with incidence of diabetes. A 
missense variant R262W in the SH2B3 (SH2B adaptor protein 3) gene, coding for a 
protein that negatively regulates hematopoietic cell proliferation, was also 
studied in relation to incidence of diabetes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Leukocyte count and its subtypes (neutrophils, lymphocytes 
and mixed cells) were analyzed in 26,667 men and women, 45-73 years old, from 
the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer study. Information about the R262W 
polymorphism (rs3184504) in SH2B3 was genotyped in 24,489 subjects. Incidence of 
diabetes was studied during a mean follow-up of 14 years. Cox proportional 
hazards regression was used to examine incidence of diabetes by total and 
differential leukocyte counts. Mendelian randomization analysis using R262W as 
an instrumental variable was performed with two-stage least squares regression. 
A total of 2,946 subjects developed diabetes during the follow-up period. After 
taking several possible confounders into account, concentrations of total 
leukocyte count, neutrophils and lymphocytes were all significantly associated 
with incidence of diabetes. The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval; 
quartile 4 vs quartile 1) were 1.37 (1.22-1.53) for total leukocytes, 1.33 
(1.19-1.49) for neutrophils and 1.29 (1.15-1.44) for lymphocytes. The R262W 
polymorphism was strongly associated with leukocytes (0.11x109 cells/l per T 
allele, p = 1.14 x10-12), lymphocytes (p = 4.3 x10-16), neutrophils (p = 8.0 
x10-6) and mixed cells (p = 3.0 x10-6). However, there was no significant 
association between R262W and fasting glucose, HbA1c or incidence of diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of total leukocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes are 
associated with incidence of diabetes. However, the lack of association with the 
R262W polymorphism suggests that the associations may not be causal, although 
limitations in statistical power and balancing pleiotropic effects cannot be 
excluded.
