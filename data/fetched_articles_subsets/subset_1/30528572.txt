OBJECTIVE: To investigate treatment-related outcomes, namely radiological clot 
resolution, post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), and health related quality-of-life 
(HRQoL) scores, in children with Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS) undergoing 
multidisciplinary management, including anticoagulation and decompressive 
rib-resection surgery, with or without thrombolytic therapy.
STUDY DESIGN: We identified all patients treated for PSS at our institution 
between the years 2010 and 2017. Baseline clinical and radiologic data were 
abstracted from medical records. Two validated survey instruments to quantify 
PTS and HRQoL were mailed to eligible patients. Standard statistical methods 
were used to summarize these measures.
RESULTS: In total, 22 eligible patients were identified; 10 were treated with 
thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation and rib resection, and 12 were treated 
with anticoagulation and rib resection alone. Nineteen patients responded to the 
survey instruments. Median age at deep vein thrombosis diagnosis and survey 
completion were 16.3 and 20.4 years, respectively. Nineteen of 22 patients had 
thrombus resolution on radiologic follow-up. Fourteen of 19 survey respondents 
reported signs/symptoms of PTS of which the majority (12/14) reported mild PTS. 
Aggregate total, physical, and psychosocial HRQoL scores reported were 90.6, 
96.7, and 93.3, respectively. Thrombolytic therapy was not associated with a 
significant improvement in radiologic, clinical or HRQoL outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with PSS had complete thrombus resolution on imaging. 
Only 11% of survey respondents reported moderate PTS. The entire cohort reported 
excellent HRQoL scores. The role for thrombolytic therapy in the management of 
childhood PSS remains incompletely elucidated.
