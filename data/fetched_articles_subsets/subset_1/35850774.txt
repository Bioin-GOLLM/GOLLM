BACKGROUND: The cause of systemic lupus erythematosus is not completely clear so 
far, but the prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus is significantly 
increased in people with additional X chromosomes.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 17-year-old Chinese female patient with systemic 
lupus erythematosus complicated with trisomy X, accompanied by lupus nephritis, 
pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and multiserous effusion. The patient recovered 
well after treatment and returned regularly. We review the previously reported 
cases to summarize the clinical characteristics of these patients.
CONCLUSION: The additional X chromosome is related to the development of 
systemic lupus erythematosus. Whether it is a subtype of systemic lupus 
erythematosus remains to be further confirmed.
