BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is strongly associated with cellular senescence. 
Numerous studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical part in 
cellular senescence. MiR-181a was reported to induce cellular senescence, 
however, the potential mechanism of miR-181a in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced 
cellular senescence remains obscure.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the role and regulatory 
mechanism of miR-181a in H2O2-induced cellular senescence.
METHODS: Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) transfected with miR-181a 
inhibitor/miR-NC with or without H2O2 treatment were divided into four groups: 
control + miR-NC/miR-181a inhibitor, H2O2 + miR-NC/miR-181a inhibitor. CCK-8 
assay was utilized to evaluate the viability of HFF. RT-qPCR was used to measure 
the expression of miR-181a and its target genes. Protein levels of protein 
disulfide isomerase family A member 6 (PDIA6) and senescence markers were 
assessed by western blotting. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) 
staining was applied for detecting SA-β-gal activity. The activities of SOD, 
GPx, and CAT were detected by corresponding assay kits. The binding relation 
between PDIA6 and miR-181a was identified by luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: MiR-181a inhibition suppressed H2O2-induced oxidative stress and 
cellular senescence in HFF. PDIA6 was targeted by miR-181a and lowly expressed 
in H2O2-treated HFF. Knocking down PDIA6 reversed miR-181a inhibition-mediated 
suppressive impact on H2O2-induced oxidative stress and cellular senescence in 
HFF.
STUDY LIMITATIONS: Signaling pathways that might be mediated by miR-181a/PDIA6 
axis were not investigated.
CONCLUSION: Downregulated miR-181a attenuates H2O2-induced oxidative stress and 
cellular senescence in HFF by targeting PDIA6.
