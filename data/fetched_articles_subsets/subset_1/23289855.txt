BACKGROUND: Murine leukemia virus-type endogenous retroviruses (MuLV-ERVs) 
constitute ~10% of the mouse genome and are associated with various 
pathophysiologic processes. In this study, we examined whether MuLV-ERVs' 
response to burn-elicited stressors is specific for certain lymphocyte 
populations and/or locations of lymphoid organ.
RESULTS: B- and T-cells, which were sorted from nine lymphoid organs of C57BL/6J 
mice after burn, were subjected to MuLV-ERV expression analyses. Overall, the 
post-burn MuLV-ERV expression pattern was dependent on lymphocyte type, time 
after injury, location of lymphoid organ, and MuLV-ERV type. For instance, the 
MuLV-ERV expression in T-cells from the thymus and three cervical lymph nodes 
decreased at 3 hours post-burn while the expression of some MuLV-ERVs was 
augmented in B-cells derived from the mesenteric lymph node. The MuLV-ERV U3 
sequences population of the burn-24 hours group was less diverse in comparison 
to the no burn and burn-3 hours groups. In addition, it was apparent that at the 
24 hours time point, the U3 populations of B-cells from both no burn and burn 
groups were less heterogeneous than the T-cells' U3 populations. Using the U3 
sequences, some of which were isolated only from specific experimental groups 
(B- vs. T-cells; no burn vs. burn), as probes, 51 putative MuLV-ERVs, including 
16 full-length proviruses, were mapped followed by characterization of their 
biologic properties.
CONCLUSION: MuLV-ERVs' response to burn-elicited stressors may be differentially 
controlled depending on lymphocyte type, location of lymphoid organ, MuLV-ERV 
type, and stress duration.
