Pediatric brain tumors have surpassed leukemia as the leading cause of 
cancer-related death in children. Several landmark studies from the last two 
decades have shown that many pediatric brain tumors are driven by epigenetic 
dysregulation within specific developmental contexts. One of the major 
determinants of epigenetic control is the histone code, which is orchestrated by 
a number of enzymes categorized as writers, erasers, and readers. Bromodomain 
and extra-terminal (BET) proteins are reader proteins that bind to acetylated 
lysines in histone tails and play a crucial role in regulating gene 
transcription. BET inhibitors have shown efficacy in a wide range of cancers, 
and a number have progressed to clinical phase testing. Here, we review the 
evidence for BET inhibitors in pediatric brain tumor experimental models, as 
well as their translational potential.
