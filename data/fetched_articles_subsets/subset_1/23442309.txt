BACKGROUND: As therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients becomes 
more personalized, additional tissue in the form of core-needle biopsies (CNBs) 
for biomarker analysis is increasingly required for determining appropriate 
treatment and for enrollment into clinical trials. We report our experience with 
small-caliber percutaneous transthoracic (PT) CNBs for the evaluation of 
multiple molecular biomarkers in BATTLE (biomarker-integrated approaches of 
targeted therapy for lung cancer elimination), a personalized, targeted therapy 
NSCLC clinical trial.
METHODS: The medical records of patients who underwent PTCNB for consideration 
of enrollment in BATTLE were reviewed for diagnostic yield of 11 predetermined 
molecular markers and procedural complications. Univariate and multivariate 
analyses of factors related to patient and lesion characteristics were performed 
to determine possible influences on diagnostic yield.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventy PTCNBs were performed using 20-gauge biopsy 
needles in 151 NSCLC patients screened for the trial. The biopsy specimens of 
82.9% of the patients were found to have adequate tumor tissue for analysis of 
the required biomarkers. On multivariate analysis, metastatic lesions were 5.4 
times more likely to yield diagnostic tissue as compared with primary tumors (p 
= 0.0079). Pneumothorax and chest tube insertion rates were 15.3% and 9.4%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Image-guided 20-gauge PTCNB is safe and provides adequate tissue 
for analysis of multiple biomarkers in the majority of patients being considered 
for enrollment into a personalized, targeted therapy NSCLC clinical trial. 
Metastatic lesions are more likely to yield diagnostic tissue as compared with 
primary tumors.
