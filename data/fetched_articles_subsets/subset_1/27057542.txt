CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful technology to perform genome editing in a 
variety of cell types. To facilitate the application of Cas9 in mapping T cell 
signaling pathways, we generated a toolbox for large-scale genetic screens in 
human Jurkat T cells. The toolbox has three different Jurkat cell lines 
expressing distinct Cas9 variants, including wild-type Cas9, dCas9-KRAB, and 
sunCas9. We demonstrated that the toolbox allows us to rapidly disrupt 
endogenous gene expression at the DNA level and to efficiently repress or 
activate gene expression at the transcriptional level. The toolbox, in 
combination with multiple currently existing genome-wide sgRNA libraries, will 
be useful to systematically investigate T cell signal transduction using both 
loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic screens.
