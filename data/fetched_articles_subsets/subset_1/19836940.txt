The conserved Aurora family of protein kinases have emerged as crucial 
regulators of mitosis and cytokinesis. Despite their high degree of homology, 
Aurora A and B have very distinctive localisations and functions: Aurora A 
associates with the spindle poles to regulate entry into mitosis, centrosome 
maturation and spindle assembly; Aurora B is a member of the Chromosomal 
Passenger Complex (CPC) that transfers from the inner centromere in early 
mitosis to the spindle midzone, equatorial cortex and midbody in late mitosis 
and cytokinesis. Aurora B functions include regulation of chromosome-microtubule 
interactions, cohesion, spindle stability and cytokinesis. This review will 
focus on how interacting proteins make this functional diversity possible by 
targeting the kinases to different subcellular locations and regulating their 
activity.
