Using the cationic polymer, Polybrene, and the anionic polymer, chondroitin 
sulfate C, we concentrated recombinant retrovirus pseudotyped with an ecotropic 
envelope, which is susceptible to inactivation by high-speed concentration 
methods. To evaluate gene marking, murine bone marrow was harvested from C3H 
mice, transduced with polymer-concentrated GFP virus, and transplanted into 
lethally irradiated recipients. Total gene marking in mice averaged 30-35% at 8 
weeks post-transplant and transgene expression remained stable for over 16 
weeks. Using the polymer concentration method, a second retroviral vector 
encoding the drug resistant variant of dihydrofolate reductase (L22Y-DHFR) was 
concentrated and tested. Approximately 40% of transduced murine bone marrow 
progenitor cells were protected against trimetrexate concentrations that 
completely eliminated the growth of non-modified cells. These results show that 
anionic and cationic polymers can be combined to rapidly concentrate viruses 
that are normally difficult to concentrate, and the concentrated virus 
efficiently transduces hematopoietic stem cells.
