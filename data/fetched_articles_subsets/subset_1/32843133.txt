Phospholipase D2 (PLD2) has been implicated in the tyrosine kinase-mediated 
signaling pathways, but the regulation events are yet to be identified. Herein, 
we demonstrate that pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLD2 (PLD2-PH) exerts an 
antitumorigenic effect via the suppression of PLD2 and focal adhesion kinase 
(FAK). The kinase domain of FAK interacts with PLD2-PH and induces tyrosine 
phosphorylation and activation of PLD2. Furthermore, PLD2 increased tyrosine 
phosphorylation of FAK. However, ectopic expression of the PLD2-PH competes for 
binding to FAK and reduces the interaction between PLD2 and FAK, thereby 
suppressing FAK-induced PLD activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. The 
PLD2-PH suppressed the migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells, as well as 
tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model. This study uncovers a novel role of 
PLD2-PH as a negative regulator of PLD2 and FAK. [BMB Reports 2021; 54(2):
