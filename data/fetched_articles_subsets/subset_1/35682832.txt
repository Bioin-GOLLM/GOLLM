The current obesity pandemic has been expanding in both developing and developed 
countries. This suggests that the factors contributing to this condition need to 
be reconsidered since some new factors are arising as etiological causes of this 
disease. Moreover, recent clinical and experimental findings have shown an 
association between the progress of obesity and some infections, and the 
functions of adipose tissues, which involve cell metabolism and adipokine 
release, among others. Furthermore, it has recently been reported that 
adipocytes could either be reservoirs for these pathogens or play an active role 
in this process. In addition, there is abundant evidence indicating that during 
obesity, the immune system is exacerbated, suggesting an increased 
susceptibility of the patient to the development of several forms of illness or 
death. Thus, there could be a relationship between infection as a trigger for an 
increase in adipose cells and the impact on the metabolism that contributes to 
the development of obesity. In this review, we describe the findings concerning 
the role of adipose tissue as a mediator in the immune response as well as the 
possible role of adipocytes as infection targets, with both roles constituting a 
possible cause of obesity.
