Acquired resistance to therapy is perhaps the greatest challenge to effective 
clinical management of cancer. With several inhibitors of the mitotic checkpoint 
kinase MPS1 in preclinical development, we sought to investigate how resistance 
against these inhibitors may arise so that mitigation or bypass strategies could 
be addressed as early as possible. Toward this end, we modeled acquired 
resistance to the MPS1 inhibitors AZ3146, NMS-P715, and CCT251455, identifying 
five point mutations in the kinase domain of MPS1 that confer resistance against 
multiple inhibitors. Structural studies showed how the MPS1 mutants conferred 
resistance by causing steric hindrance to inhibitor binding. Notably, we show 
that these mutations occur in nontreated cancer cell lines and primary tumor 
specimens, and that they also preexist in normal lymphoblast and breast tissues. 
In a parallel piece of work, we also show that the EGFR p.T790M mutation, the 
most common mutation conferring resistance to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib, also 
preexists in cancer cells and normal tissue. Our results therefore suggest that 
mutations conferring resistance to targeted therapy occur naturally in normal 
and malignant cells and these mutations do not arise as a result of the 
increased mutagenic plasticity of cancer cells.
