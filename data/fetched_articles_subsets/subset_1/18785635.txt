Depression is one of the most common nonmotor complications of Parkinson's 
disease (PD) and has a major impact on quality of life. Although several 
clinical factors have been associated with depression in PD, the relationship 
between depression and stage of illness as well as between depression and degree 
of disability remains controversial. We have collected clinical data on 1,378 PD 
cases from 632 families, using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 
(UPDRS) Parts II (activities of daily living) & III (motor), the Mini-Mental 
State Exam, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Blessed Functional 
Activity Scale (Blessed). Analyses were performed using the 840 individuals with 
verified PD and without evidence of cognitive decline. Logistic regression was 
used to identify study variables that individually and collectively best 
predicted the presence of depressive symptoms (GDS >or= 10). After correcting 
for multiple tests, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with Hoehn 
and Yahr stage and other clinical measures but not with any genetic variant 
(parkin, LRRK2, APOE). The Blessed score, education, presence of a first degree 
relative with signs of depression, and UPDRS Part II were found to best predict 
depressive symptomatology (R(2) = 0.33; P = 4 x 10(-48)). Contrary to several 
reports, the results from this large study indicate that stage of illness, motor 
impairment, and functional disability are strongly correlated with depressive 
symptoms.
