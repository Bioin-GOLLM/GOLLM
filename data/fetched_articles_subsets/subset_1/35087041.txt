Diffraction-limited two-photon microscopy permits minimally invasive optical 
monitoring of neuronal activity. However, most conventional two-photon 
microscopes impose significant constraints on the size of the imaging 
field-of-view and the specific shape of the effective excitation volume, thus 
limiting the scope of biological questions that can be addressed and the 
information obtainable. Here, employing a non-telecentric optical design, we 
present a low-cost, easily implemented and flexible solution to address these 
limitations, offering a several-fold expanded three-dimensional field of view. 
Moreover, rapid laser-focus control via an electrically tunable lens allows 
near-simultaneous imaging of remote regions separated in three dimensions and 
permits the bending of imaging planes to follow natural curvatures in biological 
structures. Crucially, our core design is readily implemented (and reversed) 
within a matter of hours, making it highly suitable as a base platform for 
further development. We demonstrate the application of our system for imaging 
neuronal activity in a variety of examples in zebrafish, mice and fruit flies.
