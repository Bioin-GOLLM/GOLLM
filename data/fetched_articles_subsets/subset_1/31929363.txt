The main challenge in the field of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is 
antibiotic resistance, which influences the efficacy of eradication regimens. 
Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy has been confirmed as an effective regimen 
for eradicating H. pylori, especially in strains with antibiotic resistance. 
High-dose proton-pump inhibitor-amoxicillin dual therapy could decrease the use 
of unnecessary antibiotics, which is a promising alternative approach. Adjuvant 
therapy (specific probiotic or vitamin) also showed good results, although more 
evidence is needed. Novel anti-H. pylori drugs are needed, and the establishment 
of the H. pylori database is an effective way to acknowledge the real-time 
information of H. pylori management. This review provides the recent progress of 
H. pylori treatment, and further studies are needed to address the role of 
different regimens in improving H. pylori eradication rate, especially in 
strains with antibiotics resistance.
