PRL-3, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, has attracted much attention as its 
transcript is consistently upregulated in the process of colorectal cancer 
metastases to secondary organs. We studied mice injected via the tail vein with 
CHO cells stably expressing EGFP-tagged PRL-3 or catalytically inactive mutant 
PRL-3 (C104S). Our data showed that the EGFP-PRL-3-expressing cells rapidly 
induce metastatic tumor formation in lung, while EGFP-PRL-3 (C104S)-expressing 
cells lose this metastastic activity. Furthermore, detailed microscopic 
examinations revealed that some EGF-PRL-3-, but not EGFP-PRL-3 (C104S)-, 
expressing cells form micro- and macro-metastatic solid tumors that sprout into 
blood vessels. Our studies provide clear evidence for a causative role of PRL-3 
phosphatase activity in cancer metastasis and tumor-related angiogenesis events. 
The catalytic domain of PRL-3 could serve as an ideal therapeutic target for 
drug development to block the spread of colorectal cancer.
