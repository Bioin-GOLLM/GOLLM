Brown planthopper (BPH) is a phloem sap-sucking insect pest of rice which causes 
severe yield loss. We cloned the BPH18 gene from the BPH-resistant introgression 
line derived from the wild rice species Oryza australiensis. Map-based cloning 
and complementation test revealed that the BPH18 encodes CC-NBS-NBS-LRR protein. 
BPH18 has two NBS domains, unlike the typical NBS-LRR proteins. The BPH18 
promoter::GUS transgenic plants exhibited strong GUS expression in the vascular 
bundles of the leaf sheath, especially in phloem cells where the BPH attacks. 
The BPH18 proteins were widely localized to the endo-membranes in a cell, 
including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, trans-Golgi network, and 
prevacuolar compartments, suggesting that BPH18 may recognize the BPH invasion 
at endo-membranes in phloem cells. Whole genome sequencing of the near-isogenic 
lines (NILs), NIL-BPH18 and NIL-BPH26, revealed that BPH18 located at the same 
locus of BPH26. However, these two genes have remarkable sequence differences 
and the independent NILs showed differential BPH resistance with different 
expression patterns of plant defense-related genes, indicating that BPH18 and 
BPH26 are functionally different alleles. These findings would facilitate 
elucidation of the molecular mechanism of BPH resistance and the identified 
novel alleles to fast track breeding BPH resistant rice cultivars.
