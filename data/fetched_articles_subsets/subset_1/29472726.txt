Single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful tool for revealing heterogeneity in cancer 
cells. However, each of the current single-cell RNA-seq platforms has inherent 
advantages and disadvantages. Here, we show that combining the different 
single-cell RNA-seq platforms can be an effective approach to obtaining complete 
information about expression differences and a sufficient cellular population to 
understand transcriptional heterogeneity in cancers. We demonstrate that it is 
possible to estimate missing expression information. We further demonstrate that 
even in the cases where precise information for an individual gene cannot be 
inferred, the activity of given transcriptional modules can be analyzed. 
Interestingly, we found that two distinct transcriptional modules, one 
associated with the Aurora kinase gene and the other with the DUSP gene, are 
aberrantly regulated in a minor population of cells and may thus contribute to 
the possible emergence of dormancy or eventual drug resistance within the 
population.
