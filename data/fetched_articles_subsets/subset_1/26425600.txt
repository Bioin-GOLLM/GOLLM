Pulmonary artery sarcomas (PAS) are extremely rare sarcomas of uncertain 
histogenesis that often mimic pulmonary thromboemboli. This is a report of a 
60-year-old female patient who presented with recurrent chest pain and cough. 
The patient was first diagnosed with pulmonary embolism but she did not improve 
on anticoagulant therapy. Follow-up imaging studies revealed a mass in the left 
hilar region extending into the pulmonary trunk and branches of the left 
pulmonary artery. The tru-cut biopsy revealed an undifferentiated sarcoma. The 
patient died 10 months after her initial presentation.
