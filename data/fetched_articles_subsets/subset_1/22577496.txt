The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a current concept review on the 
diagnosis and management of diabetic foot infections which are among the most 
serious and frequent complications encountered in patients with diabetes 
mellitus. A literature review on diabetic foot infections with emphasis on 
pathophysiology, identifiable risk factors, evaluation including physical 
examination, laboratory values, treatment strategies and assessing the severity 
of infection has been performed in detail. Diabetic foot infections are 
associated with high morbidity and risk factors for failure of treatment and 
classification systems are also described. Most diabetic foot infections begin 
with a wound and once an infection occurs, the risk of hospitalization and 
amputation increases dramatically. Early identification of infection and prompt 
treatment may optimize the patient's outcome and provide limb salvage.
