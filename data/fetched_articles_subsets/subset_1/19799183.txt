During meiosis Spo11 catalyzes the formation of DNA double-strand breaks, 
becoming covalently attached to the 5' ends on both sides of the break during 
this process. Spo11 is removed from the DSB by single-stranded endonucleolytic 
cleavage flanking the DSB, liberating a short-lived species consisting of Spo11 
protein covalently linked to a short oligonucleotide. The method presented here 
details how to detect these Spo11-oligo complexes in extracts made from meiotic 
yeast cells.
