INTRODUCTION: Although programmed cell death protein 1 and programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade in combination with platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy has become a mainstay of first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC, 
factors associated with efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) are not well 
characterized.
METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective analysis, clinicopathologic and 
genomic data were collected from patients with advanced NSCLC (lacking 
sensitizing genomic alterations in EGFR and ALK) and evaluated with clinical 
outcomes to first-line CIT.
RESULTS: Among 1285 patients treated with CIT, a worsening performance status 
and increasing derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in the blood were 
associated with a significantly reduced objective response rate (ORR), median 
progression-free survival (mPFS), and median overall survival (mOS). With 
increasing PD-L1 tumor proportion scores of less than 1%, 1% to 49%, 50% to 89%, 
and greater than or equal to 90%, there was a progressive improvement in ORR 
(32.7% versus 37.5% versus 51.6% versus 61.7%, p < 0.001), mPFS (5.0 versus 6.1 
versus 6.8 versus 13.0 mo, p < 0.001), and generally mOS (12.9 versus 14.6 
versus 34.7 versus 23.1 mo, p = 0.009), respectively. Of 789 NSCLCs with 
comprehensive genomic data, NSCLCs with a tumor mutational burden (TMB) greater 
than or equal to the 90th percentile had an improved ORR (53.5% versus 36.4%, 
p = 0.004), mPFS (10.8 versus 5.5 mo, p < 0.001), and mOS (29.2 versus 13.1 mo, 
p < 0.001), compared with those with a TMB less than the 90th percentile. In 
all-comers with nonsquamous NSCLC, the presence of an STK11, KEAP1, or SMARCA4 
mutation was associated with significantly worse ORR, mPFS, and mOS to CIT (all 
p < 0.05); this was also observed in the KRAS-mutant subgroup of NSCLCs with 
co-occurring mutations in STK11, KEAP1, or SMARCA4 (all p < 0.05). In KRAS 
wild-type NSCLC, KEAP1 and SMARCA4 mutations were associated with a 
significantly shorter mPFS and mOS to CIT (all p < 0.05), but STK11 mutation 
status had no significant impact on mPFS (p = 0.16) or mOS (p = 0.38).
CONCLUSIONS: In advanced NSCLC, better patient performance status, low derived 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, increasing PD-L1 expression, a very high TMB, 
and STK11/KEAP1/SMARCA4 wild-type status are associated with improved clinical 
outcomes to first-line CIT.
