BACKGROUND: Among manufactured or engineered nanoparticles, carbon black (CB) 
has largest production worldwide and is also an occupational respiratory hazard 
commonly seen in rubber industry. Few studies have assessed the risk for 
cardiovascular disease in carbon black exposed populations. An endothelial 
biosensor assay was used to quantify the capacity of sera from 82 carbon black 
packers (CBP) and 106 non-CBPs to induce endothelial cell activation ex vivo. 
The mediation effect of circulatory proinflammatory factors on the association 
between carbon black exposure and endothelial cell activation was assessed and 
further validated using in vitro intervention experiments.
RESULTS: The average elemental carbon level inside carbon black bagging 
facilities was 657.0 μg/m3, which was 164-fold higher than that seen in 
reference areas (4.0 μg/m3). A global index was extracted from mRNA expression 
of seven candidate biosensor genes using principal component analysis and used 
to quantify the magnitude of endothelial cell activation. This global index was 
found to be significantly altered in CBPs compared to non-CBPs (P < 0.0001), 
however this difference did not vary by smoking status (P = 0.74). Individual 
gene analyses identified that de novo expression of key adhesion molecules 
(e.g., ICAM and VCAM) and chemotactic factors (e.g., CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL8) 
responsible for the recruitment of leukocytes was dramatically induced in CBPs 
with CXCL8 showing the highest fold of induction (relative quantification = 9.1, 
P < 0.0001). The combination of mediation analyses and in vitro functional 
validation confirmed TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 as important circulatory factors 
mediating the effects of carbon black exposure on endothelial cell activation 
responses.
CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory mediators in sera from CBPs may bridge carbon black 
exposure and endothelial cell activation response assessed ex vivo. CBPs may 
have elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases when comorbidity exists. Our 
study may serve as a benchmark for understanding health effects of engineered 
carbon based nanoparticles with environmental and occupational health relevance.
