Alzheimer's disease is presumed to be caused by the formation of intracellular 
plaques of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides inside neurons. The most abundant Aβ forms 
are Aβ40 and Aβ42 comprising, respectively, 40 and 42 residues. Recent 
experiments showed that the triple Gly33Val-Val36Pro-Gly38Val (VPV) mutation 
causes Aβ42 to become "super-Aβ42" with elevated aggregation rates and toxicity. 
Upon VPV mutation, oligomerization pathways of Aβ40 become similar to those of 
the Aβ42 wild type. It was hypothesized that the super behavior of Aβ42 occurs 
due to an enhanced content of the β-turn and β-hairpin, centered at residues 
36-37, and the similarity in oligomerization pathways of Aβ40-VPV and Aβ42-WT 
comes from the increased β-turn population. As this is based on simulation of 
the truncated fragments, this hypothesis may not be valid for the full-length 
case, motivating us to perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for 
full-length Aβ sequences. We showed that the results obtained for truncated 
peptides fall short in explaining the similarity of self-assembly pathways of 
Aβ40-VPV and Aβ42-WT. Instead, we propose that the similarity is due to not only 
increased β-turn population but also due to the elevated β-structure of the 
entire sequence. Similar to VPV, the Gly33Val-Val36Asn-Gly38Leu mutation 
enhances the β-structure and the C-terminal β-turn making the behavior of Aβ40 
similar to that of Aβ42-WT.
