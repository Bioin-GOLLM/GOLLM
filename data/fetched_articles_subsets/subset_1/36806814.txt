Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global pandemic. 
CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib was reported to be one of the top-scored repurposed 
drugs to treat COVID-19. As the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry, expression level of angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we 
demonstrated that palbociclib and other methods could arrest cells in G0/G1 
phase and up-regulate ACE2 mRNA and protein levels without altering its 
subcellular localization. Palbociclib inhibited ubiquitin-proteasome and 
lysosomal degradation of ACE2 through down-regulating S-phase kinase-associated 
protein 2 (SKP2). In addition, increased ACE2 expression induced by palbociclib 
and other cell cycle arresting compounds facilitated pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 
infection. This study suggested that ACE2 expression was down-regulated in 
proliferating cells. Cell cycle arresting compounds could increase ACE2 
expression and facilitate SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, which may not be suitable 
therapeutic agents for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
