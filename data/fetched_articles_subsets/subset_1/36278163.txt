Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is increasingly becoming a main complication of 
diabetes, and is difficult to cure. In our research, network pharmacology 
analysis suggested that both compound Danshen dripping pills (CDDP) and 
bezafibrate (BZF) have potential protective effects against DR and the two drugs 
may act synergistically. The pharmacological effects of the coadministration of 
CDDP and BZF were elucidated in db/db mice, which simulate DR. Fluorescein 
fundus angiography showed that coadministration attenuated vascular leakage. 
Optical coherence tomography and hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that 
coadministration improved retinal thickness better than CDDP monotherapy. In 
addition, cell fluorescence images of reactive oxygen species revealed that 
coadministration of CDDP and BZF had more potent effects against oxidative 
stress than CDDP monotherapy. Metabolomics analysis showed that coadministration 
reduced the ratio of oxidized glutathione to reduced glutathione further than 
CDDP monotherapy. Coadministration of CDDP and BZF may provide additional 
protective effects by resisting vascular leakage, increasing retinal thickness, 
and inhibiting inflammation and oxidative stress in DR.
