Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the major disabilities dealt with in clinical 
rehabilitation settings and is multifactorial in that the patients suffer from 
motor and sensory impairments as well as many other complications throughout 
their lifetimes. Many clinical trials have been documented during the last two 
decades to restore damaged spinal cords. However, only a few pharmacological 
therapies used in clinical settings which still have only limited effects on the 
regeneration, recovery speed, or retraining of the spinal cord. In this paper, 
we will introduce recent clinical trials, which performed pharmacological 
treatments and cell transplantations for patients with SCI, and evaluate recent 
in vivo studies for the regeneration of injured spinal cord, including stem-cell 
transplantation, application of neurotrophic factors and suppressor of 
inhibiting factors, development of biomaterial scaffolds and delivery systems, 
rehabilitation, and the combinations of these therapies to evaluate what can be 
appropriately applied in the future to the patients with SCI.
