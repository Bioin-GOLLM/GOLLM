PURPOSE: The prevalence of the tall cell variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(TCVPTC), which has a poor prognosis, has increased as its definition has been 
modified. We sought to investigate whether TCVPTC is different from the classic 
type on ultrasonography (US).
METHODS: This study included 46 consecutive TCVPTC patients and 92 classic 
papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients who were confirmed surgically at the 
authors' institution. The US findings and pathologic reports of these patients 
were retrospectively reviewed. US features based on the Korean Thyroid Imaging 
Reporting and Data System, preoperative US suspicion for lymph node metastasis, 
and the presence of capsular location were evaluated.
RESULTS: Univariable and multivariable analyses identified that TCVPTC showed 
more frequent irregular tumor margin (odds ratio [OR], 6.62; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.46 to 30.09; P=0.014) and capsular location (OR, 4.63; 95% CI, 
1.49 to 14.41; P=0.008) than classic PTC. Capsular location was an independent 
predictor of TCVPTC for tumors less than or equal to 1.5 cm in size (OR, 4.23; 
95% CI, 1.12 to 15.92; P=0.033). Irregular margin was an independent predictor 
of TCVPTC for tumors larger than 1.5 cm (OR, 10.46; 95% CI, 1.16 to 94.48; 
P=0.037). Extrathyroidal extension was not significantly different between the 
two groups.
CONCLUSION: The two key features of TCVPTC on US are frequent capsular location 
for tumors less than or equal to 1.5 cm in size and the higher likelihood of an 
irregular margin for tumors larger than 1.5 cm.
