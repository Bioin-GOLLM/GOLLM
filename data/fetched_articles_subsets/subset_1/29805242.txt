This paper provides a new way of developing the "Fast Iterative 
Shrinkage/Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA)" [3] that is widely used for minimizing 
composite convex functions with a nonsmooth term such as the â„“1 regularizer. In 
particular, this paper shows that FISTA corresponds to an optimized approach to 
accelerating the proximal gradient method with respect to a worst-case bound of 
the cost function. This paper then proposes a new algorithm that is derived by 
instead optimizing the step coefficients of the proximal gradient method with 
respect to a worst-case bound of the composite gradient mapping. The proof is 
based on the worst-case analysis called Performance Estimation Problem in [11].
