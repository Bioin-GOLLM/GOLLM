Vascular calcification (VC) is an urgent worldwide health issue with no 
available medical treatment. It is an active cell-driven process by osteogenic 
differentiation of vascular cells with complex mechanisms. The AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) serves as the master sensor of cellular energy status. 
Accumulating evidence reveals the vital role of AMPK in VC progression. AMPK is 
involved in VC in various ways, including inhibiting runt-related transcription 
factor 2 signaling pathways, triggering autophagy, attenuating endoplasmic 
reticulum stress and dynamic-related protein 1-mediated mitochondrial fission, 
and activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase. AMPK activators, like 
metformin, are associated with reduced calcification deposits in certain groups 
of patients, indicating that AMPK is a potential therapeutic target for VC.
