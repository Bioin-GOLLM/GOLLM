Seeds are essential for human civilization, so understanding the molecular 
events underpinning seed development and the zygotic embryo it contains is 
important. In addition, the approach of somatic embryogenesis is a critical 
propagation and regeneration strategy to increase desirable genotypes, to 
develop new genetically modified plants to meet agricultural challenges, and at 
a basic science level, to test gene function. We briefly review some of the 
transcription factors (TFs) involved in establishing primary and apical 
meristems during zygotic embryogenesis, as well as TFs necessary and/or 
sufficient to drive somatic embryo programs. We focus on the model plant 
Arabidopsis for which many tools are available, and review as well as speculate 
about comparisons and contrasts between zygotic and somatic embryo processes.
