BACKGROUND: Clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats 
(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated genome editing permits the 
rapid production of genetically engineered mice. To make the most of this 
innovative technology, a streamlined procedure is needed for the robust 
construction of CRISPR/Cas9 vectors, the efficient preparation of mouse oocytes, 
and refined genotyping strategies. Although we previously demonstrated the 
applicability of oocyte cryopreservation technologies and various genotyping 
methods in the production of transcription activator-like effector 
nuclease-mediated genome editing in mice, it has not yet been clarified whether 
these techniques can be applied to the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation of 
knockout mice. In this study, we investigated easy, efficient, and robust 
methods of creating knockout mice using several CRISPR/Cas9 systems.
RESULTS: We constructed three types of CRISPR/Cas9 vectors expressing: 1) single 
guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 nuclease, 2) two gRNAs and Cas9 nickase, and 3) two 
gRNAs and FokI-dCas9, targeting the same genomic locus. These vectors were 
directly microinjected into the pronucleus of freeze-thawed fertilized oocytes, 
and surviving oocytes were transferred to pseudopregnant ICR mice. Cas9 nuclease 
resulted in the highest mutation rates with the lowest birth rates, while Cas9 
nickase resulted in the highest birth rates with the lowest mutation rates. 
FokI-dCas9 presented well-balanced mutation and birth rates. Furthermore, we 
constructed a single all-in-one FokI-dCas9 vector targeting two different 
genomic loci, and validated its efficacy by blastocyst analysis, resulting in 
highly efficient simultaneous targeted mutagenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our report offers several choices of researcher-friendly 
consolidated procedures for making CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout mice, with 
sophisticated construction systems for various types of CRISPR vectors, 
convenient preparation of in vitro fertilized or mated freeze-thawed oocytes, 
and an efficient method of mutant screening.
