BACKGROUND: More than 200 asthma-associated genetic variants have been 
identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTL) data resources can help identify causal genes of the GWAS 
signals, but it can be difficult to find an eQTL that reflects the disease state 
because most eQTL data are obtained from normal healthy subjects.
METHODS: We performed a blood eQTL analysis using transcriptomic and genotypic 
data from 433 Korean asthma patients. To identify asthma-related genes, we 
carried out colocalization, Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) 
analysis, and Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) using the results of 
asthma GWASs and eQTL data. In addition, we compared the results of disease eQTL 
data and asthma-related genes with two normal blood eQTL data from 
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and a Japanese study.
RESULTS: We identified 340,274 cis-eQTL and 2,875 eGenes from asthmatic eQTL 
analysis. We compared the disease eQTL results with GTEx and a Japanese study 
and found that 64.1% of the 2,875 eGenes overlapped with the GTEx eGenes and 
39.0% with the Japanese eGenes. Following the integrated analysis of the 
asthmatic eQTL data with asthma GWASs, using colocalization and SMR methods, we 
identified 15 asthma-related genes specific to the Korean asthmatic eQTL data.
CONCLUSIONS: We provided Korean asthmatic cis-eQTL data and identified 
asthma-related genes by integrating them with GWAS data. In addition, we 
suggested these asthma-related genes as therapeutic targets for asthma. We 
envisage that our findings will contribute to understanding the etiological 
mechanisms of asthma and provide novel therapeutic targets.
