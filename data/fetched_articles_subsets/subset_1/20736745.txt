Activating mutations in members of the RAS oncogene family (KRAS, HRAS, and 
NRAS) have been found in a variety of human malignancies, suggesting a dominant 
role in carcinogenesis. In colon cancers, KRAS mutations are common and clearly 
contribute to malignant progression. The frequency of NRAS mutations and their 
relationship with clinical, pathologic, and molecular features remains 
uncertain. We developed and validated a Pyroseqencing assay to detect NRAS 
mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61. Using a collection of 225 colorectal cancers 
from 2 prospective cohort studies, we examined the relationship between NRAS 
mutations, clinical outcome, and other molecular features, including mutation of 
KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, microsatellite instability, and the CpG island 
methylator phenotype. Finally, we examined whether NRAS mutation was associated 
with patient survival or prognosis. NRAS mutations were detected in 5 (2.2%) of 
the 225 colorectal cancers and tended to occur in left-sided cancers arising in 
women, but did not seem to be associated with any of the molecular features that 
were examined.
