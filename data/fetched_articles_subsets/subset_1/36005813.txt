Tricyclic pyrrolopyrimidines (TPPs) are a new class of antibacterials inhibiting 
the ATPase of DNA gyrase. TPP8, a representative of this class, is active 
against Mycobacterium abscessus in vitro. Spontaneous TPP8 resistance mutations 
mapped to the ATPase domain of M. abscessus DNA gyrase, and the compound 
inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of recombinant M. abscessus enzyme. Further 
profiling of TPP8 in macrophage and mouse infection studies demonstrated 
proof-of-concept activity against M. abscessus ex vivo and in vivo.
