Among disorders of pigmentation, vitiligo is the most common, with an estimated 
prevalence between 0.5% and 1%. The disease has gathered increased attention in 
the most recent years, leading to a better understanding of the disease's 
pathophysiology and its implications and to the development of newer therapeutic 
strategies. A better, more integrated approach is already in use for other 
chronic inflammatory dermatological diseases such as psoriasis, for which 
metabolic comorbidities are well-established and part of the routine clinical 
evaluation. The pathogenesis of these might be linked to cytokines which also 
play a role in vitiligo pathogenesis, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-Î±, and possibly 
IL-17. Following the reports of intrinsic metabolic alterations reported by our 
group, in this brief review, we analyze the available data on metabolic 
comorbidities in vitiligo, accompanied by our single-center experience. 
Increased awareness of the metabolic aspects of vitiligo is crucial to improving 
patient care.
