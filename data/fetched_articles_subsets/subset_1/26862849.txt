Tumor cells communicate with stromal cells, including cancer-associated 
fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), to form 
microenvironment inhibiting immune responses. Regulatory T cells (Tregs, 
CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) stimulate immune tolerance and facilitate tumor progression. We 
analyzed the changes in Treg frequencies assessed using flow cytometry in the 
peripheral blood of patients with urothelial bladder cancer before and after 
tumor-removal. Changes in Treg frequency were investigated in relation to 
clinicopathomorphological indicators of tumor malignancy and expression of RCAS1 
on CAFs and TAMs. Higher Treg frequencies were observed in early phase of tumor 
growth (pTa-pT2), in larger tumors, with more aggressive type of invasion, and 
with expression of RCAS1. The later phase of tumor development, accompanied by a 
nonclassic differentiations and pT3-pT4 advancement, had lower number of tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and lower Treg frequency. Furthermore, in 
pT2-pT4 tumors, a decreased post-surgery Treg frequency was associated with 
poorer prognosis: patients with the lowest frequency of Tregs died first. These 
findings strongly suggest that the Treg frequencies at later phase of tumor 
growth, associated with a low anti-tumor response, represent a new and important 
prognostic indicator in urinary bladder cancer.
