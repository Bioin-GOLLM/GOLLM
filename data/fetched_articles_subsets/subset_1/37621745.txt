The Hudson River (HR) Estuary has a long history of pollution with a variety of 
contaminants including PCBs, and dioxins. In fact, 200 miles of the mainstem HR 
is designated a U.S. federal Superfund site, the largest in the nation, because 
of PCB contamination. The tidal HR hosts the southernmost spawning population of 
Atlantic tomcod, and studies revealed a correlation between exposure of 
juveniles to warm water temperature during summer to abundance of spawning 
adults of the same cohort in the following winter. Further, a battery of 
mechanistically linked biomarkers, ranging from the molecular to the population 
levels, were significantly impacted from contaminant exposures of the HR tomcod 
population. In response to xenobiotic insult, the HR tomcod population developed 
resistance to PCB sand TCDD toxicity resulting from a deletion in the aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor2 (AHR2) gene. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis of global gene 
expression demonstrated that effects of the AHR2 polymorphism were far more 
pervasive than anticipated. The most highly PCB-contaminated sediments in the 
upper HR were dredged between 2009 and 2015 with the objective of lowering PCB 
concentrations in fishes in the lower HR. Success of the remediation project has 
been controversial. These observations suggest that tomcod provides an 
informative model to evaluate the efficacy of HR PCB remediation efforts on 
downriver fish populations and possible interactive effects between contaminant 
exposure and a warming environment.
