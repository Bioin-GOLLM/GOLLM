An m.10158T>C mutation in MT-ND3, encoding a subunit of respiratory complex I, 
causes early-onset Leigh syndrome (LS), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with 
lactic acid and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, and LS and MELAS 
overlapping syndrome, presumably dependent on the ratio of heteroplasmy. Herein, 
we report a 4-year-old girl with heteroplasmic m.10158T>C mutation, showing an 
evolving age-dependent phenotype from LS to MELAS syndromes. She showed mild 
developmental delay during infancy, which was associated with magnetic resonance 
imaging lesions in the brain stem and basal ganglia. At the age of 4 years, she 
developed rapid neurological deterioration and intractable seizures, which was 
associated with recurrent multiple cerebral lesions as well as basal ganglia 
lesions. Her cerebral lesions were located predominantly in white matter and 
appeared at multiple areas simultaneously, unique characteristics that are 
distinct from typical MELAS. Two patients with LS-MELAS overlapping syndrome 
with m.10158T>C have been previously reported, however, this is the first 
patient with m.10158T>C showing significant age-dependent changes in clinical 
features and neuro-images, implying an age-dependent role of complex I in the 
developing brain.
