Research on siRNA delivery has seen tremendous growth over the past few decades. 
As one of the major delivery strategies, siRNA bioconjugates offer the potential 
to enhance and extend the pharmacological properties of siRNAs while minimizing 
toxicity. In this paper, we suggest the development of a siRNA conjugate 
platform with peptides and proteins that are ligands of target receptors for 
cancer treatment. The siRNA bioconjugates target and block the receptor membrane 
proteins, enter the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, and inhibit the 
expression of that same target membrane receptor, thereby doubly controlling the 
function of the membrane proteins. The three kinds of bioconjugates targeting 
CD47, PD-L1, and EGFR were synthesized via two different copper-free click 
chemistry reactions. Results showed the cellular uptake of each conjugate, 
reduction of target gene expression, and efficient functional control of 
receptor proteins. This platform provides an effective approach for regulating 
membrane proteins in various diseases beyond cancer.
