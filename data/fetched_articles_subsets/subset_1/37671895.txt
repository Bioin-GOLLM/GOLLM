Studies mapping genetic heterogeneity of clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis 
for determining their strain lineage and drug resistance by whole-genome 
sequencing are limited in high tuberculosis burden settings. We carried out 
whole-genome sequencing of 242 M. tuberculosis isolates from drug-sensitive and 
drug-resistant tuberculosis patients, identified and collected as part of the TB 
Portals Program, to have a comprehensive insight into the genetic diversity of 
M. tuberculosis in Southern India. We report several genetic variations in M. 
tuberculosis that may confer resistance to antitubercular drugs. Further 
wide-scale efforts are required to fully characterize M. tuberculosis genetic 
diversity at a population level in high tuberculosis burden settings for 
providing precise tuberculosis treatment.
