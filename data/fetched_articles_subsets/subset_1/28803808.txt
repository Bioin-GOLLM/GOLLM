Two novel mutations (p.(Ser160Pro) and p.(Arg472Cys)) causing 
glucose-6-phosphate isomerase deficiency are associated with erythroid dysplasia 
and inappropriately suppressed hepcidin.

Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency, a genetic disorder responsible 
for chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, is the second most common red blood 
cell glycolytic enzymopathy. We report three patients from two unrelated 
families of Czech and Slovak origin with macrocytic hemolytic anemia due to GPI 
deficiency. The first patient had 15% of residual GPI activity resulting from 
two new heterozygous missense mutations c.478T>C and c.1414C>T leading to 
substitutions p.(Ser160Pro) and p.(Arg472Cys). Two other patients (siblings) 
inherited the same c.1414C>T p.(Arg472Cys) mutation in a homozygous constitution 
and lost approximately 89% of their GPI activity. Erythroid hyperplasia with 
dysplastic features was observed in the bone marrow of all three patients. Low 
hepcidin/ferritin ratio and elevated soluble transferrin receptor detected in 
our GPI-deficient patients suggest disturbed balance between erythropoiesis and 
iron metabolism contributing to iron overload.
