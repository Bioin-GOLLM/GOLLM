The KRAS gene (Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) is an 
oncogene that encodes a small GTPase transductor protein called KRAS. KRAS is 
involved in the regulation of cell division as a result of its ability to relay 
external signals to the cell nucleus. Activating mutations in the KRAS gene 
impair the ability of the KRAS protein to switch between active and inactive 
states, leading to cell transformation and increased resistance to chemotherapy 
and biological therapies targeting epidermal growth factor receptors. This 
review highlights some of the features of the KRAS gene and the KRAS protein and 
summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism of KRAS gene regulation. It also 
underlines the importance of activating mutations in the KRAS gene in relation 
to carcinogenesis and their importance as diagnostic biomarkers, providing clues 
regarding human cancer patients' prognosis and indicating potential therapeutic 
approaches.
