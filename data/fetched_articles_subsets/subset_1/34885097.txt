Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) 
are non-coding transcripts which are involved in the pathogenesis of pituitary 
gland tumors. LncRNAs that participate in the pathogenesis of pituitary gland 
tumors mainly serve as sponges for miRNAs. CLRN1-AS1/miR-217, XIST/miR-424-5p, 
H19/miR-93a, LINC00473/miR-502-3p, SNHG7/miR-449a, MEG8/miR-454-3p, 
MEG3/miR-23b-3p, MEG3/miR-376B-3P, SNHG6/miR-944, PCAT6/miR-139-3p, 
lncRNA-m433s1/miR-433, TUG1/miR-187-3p, SNHG1/miR-187-3p, SNHG1/miR-302, 
SNHG1/miR-372, SNHG1/miR-373, and SNHG1/miR-520 are identified lncRNA/miRNA 
pairs that are involved in this process. Hsa_circ_0001368 and circOMA1 are two 
examples of circRNAs that contribute to the pathogenesis of pituitary gland 
tumors. Meanwhile, SNHG1, LINC00702, LINC00460, and MEG3 have been found to 
partake in the pathogenesis of meningioma. In the current review, we describe 
the role of non-coding RNAs in two types of brain tumors, i.e., pituitary tumors 
and meningioma.
