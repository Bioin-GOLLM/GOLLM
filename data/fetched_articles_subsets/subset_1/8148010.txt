Phosphoserine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52), an enzyme of the "phosphorylated 
pathway" leading to the formation of serine, was purified from Scenedesmus 
obliquus, mutant C-2 A'. Purification started from the soluble supernatant of a 
crude cell homogenate and included different affinity and DEAE chromatographic 
techniques, as well as gel filtration. The purified phosphoserine 
aminotransferase was enriched 1537-fold and identified to be a homodimer with 
subunit molecular masses of 40 kDa, each. The absorption spectrum is consistent 
with the presence of pyridoxal-5-phosphate as cofactor. From the purified enzyme 
18 amino acids of the N-terminus could be determined, showing at least 67% 
homology with the serC gene encoding phosphoserine aminotransferases from 
bacterial organisms.
