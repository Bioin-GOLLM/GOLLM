Multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are 
neuroinflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), where leukocytes 
and CNS resident cells play important roles in disease development and 
pathogenesis. The antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) has been shown to suppress 
EAE by modulating dendritic cells (DCs) and Th17 cells. However, the mechanism 
of action by which CQ modulates EAE is far from being elucidated. Here, we 
comprehensively analyzed the CNS of CQ and PBS-treated EAE mice to identify and 
characterize the cells that are affected by CQ. Our results show that leukocytes 
are largely modulated by CQ and have a reduction in the expression of 
inflammatory markers. Intriguingly, CQ vastly modulated the CNS resident cells 
astrocytes, oligodendrocytes (OLs) and microglia (MG), with the latter producing 
IL-10 and IL-12p70. Overall, our results show a panoramic view of the cellular 
components that are affect by CQ and provide further evidence that drug 
repurposing of CQ will be beneficial to MS patients.
