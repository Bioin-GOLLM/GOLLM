OBJECTIVE: To analyze the frequency of major age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD)-associated alleles in patients with multifocal choroiditis (MFC).
METHODS: A cohort of 48 patients with MFC was compared with previously 
characterized cohorts of patients with advanced AMD (368 samples) and matched 
unaffected controls (368 samples). Allele and genotype frequencies of single 
nucleotide polymorphisms for the following AMD-associated alleles were 
evaluated: risk alleles in complement factor H (CFH) gene (Y402H and IVS14) and 
LOC387715/HTRA1 gene on 10q26 (A69S) and protective alleles in CFH (IVS1, IVS6, 
and delCFHR1-3) and complement factor B loci (H9L and R32Q).
RESULTS: Frequencies of all major AMD-associated alleles in the CFH locus 
indicate a strong, statistically significant association of CFH gene single 
nucleotide polymorphisms and MFC. However, the same analysis for the single 
nucleotide polymorphisms in complement factor B and 10q26 loci matched the 
results in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Like AMD, the MFC phenotype is strongly associated with the major 
alleles/haplotypes in the CFH locus. Clinical Relevance We report compelling 
evidence of a strong association between CFH polymorphisms and MFC, which 
contributes to the understanding of MFC pathogenesis and suggests new potential 
therapeutic targets.
