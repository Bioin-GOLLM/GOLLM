Human aquaporin 1 (hAQP1) forms homotetrameric channels that facilitate fluxes 
of water and small solutes across cell membranes. In addition to water channel 
activity, hAQP1 displays non-selective monovalent cation-channel activity gated 
by intracellular cyclic GMP. Dual water and ion-channel activity of hAQP1, 
thought to regulate cell shape and volume, could offer a target for novel 
therapeutics relevant to controlling cancer cell invasiveness. This study probed 
properties of hAQP1 ion channels using proteoliposomes, which, unlike 
conventional cell-based systems such as Xenopus laevis oocytes, are relatively 
free of background ion channels. Histidine-tagged recombinant hAQP1 protein was 
synthesized and purified from the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and 
reconstituted into proteoliposomes for biophysical analyses. Osmotic water 
channel activity confirmed correct folding and channel assembly. Ion-channel 
activity of hAQP1-Myc-His6 was recorded by patch-clamp electrophysiology with 
excised patches. In symmetrical potassium, the hAQP1-Myc-His6 channels displayed 
coordinated gating, a single-channel conductance of approximately 75 pS, and 
multiple subconductance states. Applicability of this method for 
structure-function analyses was tested using hAQP1-Myc-His6 D48A/D185A channels 
modified by site-directed mutations of charged Asp residues estimated to be 
adjacent to the central ion-conducting pore of the tetramer. No differences in 
conductance were detected between mutant and wild-type constructs, suggesting 
the open-state conformation could differ substantially from expectations based 
on crystal structures. Nonetheless, the method pioneered here for AQP1 
demonstrates feasibility for future work defining structure-function 
relationships, screening pharmacological inhibitors, and testing other classes 
in the broad family of aquaporins for previously undiscovered ion-conducting 
capabilities.
