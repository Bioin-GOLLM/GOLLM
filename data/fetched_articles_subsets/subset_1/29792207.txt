BACKGROUND: Maize lethal necrosis is caused by a synergistic co-infection of 
Maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and a specific member of the Potyviridae, 
such as Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) or 
Johnson grass mosaic virus (JGMV). Typical maize lethal necrosis symptoms 
include severe yellowing and leaf drying from the edges. In Kenya, we detected 
plants showing typical and atypical symptoms. Both groups of plants often tested 
negative for SCMV by ELISA.
METHODS: We used next-generation sequencing to identify viruses associated to 
maize lethal necrosis in Kenya through a metagenomics analysis. Symptomatic and 
asymptomatic leaf samples were collected from maize and sorghum representing 
sixteen counties.
RESULTS: Complete and partial genomes were assembled for MCMV, SCMV, Maize 
streak virus (MSV) and Maize yellow dwarf virus-RMV (MYDV-RMV). These four 
viruses (MCMV, SCMV, MSV and MYDV-RMV) were found together in 30 of 68 samples. 
A geographic analysis showed that these viruses are widely distributed in Kenya. 
Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequences showed that MCMV, MYDV-RMV and MSV 
are similar to isolates from East Africa and other parts of the world. Single 
nucleotide polymorphism, nucleotide and polyprotein sequence alignments 
identified three genetically distinct groups of SCMV in Kenya. Variation mapped 
to sequences at the border of NIb and the coat protein. Partial genome sequences 
were obtained for other four potyviruses and one polerovirus.
CONCLUSION: Our results uncover the complexity of the maize lethal necrosis 
epidemic in Kenya. MCMV, SCMV, MSV and MYDV-RMV are widely distributed and 
infect both maize and sorghum. SCMV population in Kenya is diverse and consists 
of numerous strains that are genetically different to isolates from other parts 
of the world. Several potyviruses, and possibly poleroviruses, are also 
involved.
