Work on genetic model systems such as Drosophila and mouse has shown that the 
fundamental mechanisms of myogenesis are remarkably similar in vertebrates and 
invertebrates. Strikingly, however, satellite cells, the adult muscle stem cells 
that are essential for the regeneration of damaged muscles in vertebrates, have 
not been reported in invertebrates. In this study, we show that lineal 
descendants of muscle stem cells are present in adult muscle of Drosophila as 
small, unfused cells observed at the surface and in close proximity to the 
mature muscle fibers. Normally quiescent, following muscle fiber injury, we show 
that these cells express Zfh1 and engage in Notch-Delta-dependent proliferative 
activity and generate lineal descendant populations, which fuse with the injured 
muscle fiber. In view of strikingly similar morphological and functional 
features, we consider these novel cells to be the Drosophila equivalent of 
vertebrate muscle satellite cells.
