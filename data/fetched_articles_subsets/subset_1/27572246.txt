BACKGROUND: Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) is caused by mutations in the 
amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin (PS). Most PS mutations, which 
account for the majority of FAD cases, lead to an increased ratio of longer to 
shorter forms of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. The therapeutic rationale of 
γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) for Alzheimer's disease is based on this genetic 
evidence as well as on enzyme kinetics measurements showing changes in the 
processivity of the γ-secretase complex. This analysis suggests that GSMs could 
potentially offset some of the effects of PS mutations on APP processing, 
thereby addressing the root cause of early onset FAD. Unfortunately, the field 
has generated few, if any, molecules with good central nervous system (CNS) 
drug-like properties to enable proof-of-mechanism studies.
METHOD: We characterized the novel GSM FRM-36143 using multiple cellular assays 
to determine its in vitro potency and off-target activity as well as its 
potential to reverse the effect of PS mutations. We also tested its efficacy in 
vivo in wild-type mice and rats.
RESULTS: FRM-36143 has much improved CNS drug-like properties compared to 
published GSMs. It has an in vitro EC50 for Aβ42 of 35 nM in H4 cells, can 
reduce Aβ42 to 58 % of the baseline in rat cerebrospinal fluid, and also 
increases the non-amyloidogenic peptides Aβ37 and Aβ38. It does not inhibit 
Notch processing, nor does it inhibit 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) 
activity. Most interestingly, it can reverse the effects of presenilin mutations 
on APP processing in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: FRM-36143 possesses all the characteristics of a GSM in terms of Aβ 
modulation Because FRM-36143 was able to reverse the effect of PS mutations, we 
suggest that targeting patients with this genetic defect would be the best 
approach at testing the efficacy of a GSM in the clinic. While the amyloid 
hypothesis is still being tested with β-site APP-cleaving enzyme inhibitors and 
monoclonal antibodies in sporadic AD, we believe it is not a hypothesis for FAD. 
Since GSMs can correct the molecular defect caused by PS mutations, they have 
the promise to provide benefits to the patients when treated early enough in the 
course of the disease.
