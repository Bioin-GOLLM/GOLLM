Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is an autosomal recessive 
disorder of fatty acid, amino acid, and choline metabolism. We describe a 
patient identified through newborn screening in which the diagnosis of MADD was 
confirmed based on metabolic profiling, but clinical molecular sequencing of 
ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH was normal. In order to identify the genetic etiology of 
MADD, we performed whole genome sequencing and identified a novel homozygous 
promoter variant in ETFA (c.-85G > A). Subsequent studies showed decreased ETFA 
protein expression in lymphoblasts. A promoter luciferase assay confirmed 
decreased activity of the mutant promoter. In both assays, the variant displayed 
considerable residual activity, therefore we speculate that our patient may have 
a late onset form of MADD (Type III). Our findings may be helpful in 
establishing a molecular diagnosis in other MADD patients with a characteristic 
biochemical profile but apparently normal molecular studies.
