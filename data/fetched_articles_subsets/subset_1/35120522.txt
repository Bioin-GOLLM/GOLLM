BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent, and still 
incurable, form of leukemia in the Western World. It is widely accepted that 
cancer results from an evolutionary process shaped by the acquisition of driver 
mutations which confer selective growth advantage to cells that harbor them. 
Clear examples are missense mutations in classic RAS genes (KRAS, HRAS and NRAS) 
that underlie the development of approximately 13% of human cancers. Although 
autonomous B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling is involved and mutations in 
many tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have been identified, an oncogenic 
driver gene has not still been identified for CLL.
METHODS: Conditional knock-in mice were generated to overexpress wild type RRAS2 
and prove its driver role. RT-qPCR analysis of a human CLL sample cohort was 
carried out to measure RRAS2 transcriptional expression. Sanger DNA sequencing 
was used to identify a SNP in the 3'UTR region of RRAS2 in human CLL samples. 
RNAseq of murine CLL was carried out to identify activated pathways, molecular 
mechanisms and to pinpoint somatic mutations accompanying RRAS2 overexpression. 
Flow cytometry was used for phenotypic characterization and shRNA techniques to 
knockdown RRAS2 expression in human CLL.
RESULTS: RRAS2 mRNA is found overexpressed in its wild type form in 82% of the 
human CLL samples analyzed (n = 178, mean and median = 5-fold) as well as in the 
explored metadata. A single nucleotide polymorphism (rs8570) in the 3'UTR of the 
RRAS2 mRNA has been identified in CLL patients, linking higher expression of 
RRAS2 with more aggressive disease. Deliberate overexpression of wild type RRAS2 
in mice, but not an oncogenic Q72L mutation in the coding sequence, provokes the 
development of CLL. Overexpression of wild type RRAS2 in mice is accompanied by 
a strong convergent selection of somatic mutations in genes that have been 
identified in human CLL. R-RAS2 protein is physically bound to the BCR and 
mediates BCR signals in CLL.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that overexpression of wild type RRAS2 is 
behind the development of CLL.
