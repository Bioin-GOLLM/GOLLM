Salmonella Gallinarum is a host-restrict pathogen that causes fowl typhoid, a 
severe systemic disease that is one of the major concerns to the poultry 
industry worldwide. When infecting the bird, SG makes use of evasion mechanisms 
to survive and to replicate within macrophages. In this context, phoPQ genes 
encode a two-component regulatory system (PhoPQ) that regulates virulence genes 
responsible for adaptation of Salmonella spp. to antimicrobial factors such as 
low pH, antimicrobial peptides and deprivation of bivalent cations. The role of 
the mentioned genes to SG remains to be investigated. In the present study a 
phoPQ-depleted SG strain (SG ΔphoPQ) was constructed and its virulence assessed 
in twenty-day-old laying hens susceptible to fowl typhoid. SG ΔphoPQ did cause 
neither clinical signs nor mortality in birds orally challenged, being 
non-pathogenic. Furthermore, this strain was not recovered from livers or 
spleens. On the other hand, chickens challenged subcutaneously with the mutant 
strain had discreet to moderate pathological changes and also low bacterial 
counts in liver and spleen tissues. These findings show that SG ΔphoPQ is 
attenuated to susceptible chickens and suggest that these genes are important 
during chicken infection by SG.
