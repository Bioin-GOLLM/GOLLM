PURPOSE: Heterozygous inactivating mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) gene 
result in the asymptomatic fasting hyperglycemia named as GCK-MODY or MODY2. The 
genetic testing can effectively avoid the misdiagnosis and inappropriate 
treatment for GCK-MODY.
METHODS: A total of 25 unrelated families with MODY were screened for mutations 
in coding region of GCK by using direct sequencing. Three different 
bioinformatics tools such as PolyPhen2, Mutation Taster and PROVEAN were 
performed to predict the function of mutant proteins. The glucose profile was 
recorded by continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) to evaluate the glycemic 
variability for the GCK-MODY patient.
RESULTS: Our study identified five GCK mutations in 24% of the families (6/25): 
two novel mutations (I126fs and G385A) and three already described mutations 
(G44S, H50fs and S383L). In silico analyses predicted that these mutations 
altered structural conformational changes. The values of mean amplitude of 
glycemic excursions (MAGE), an important index of blood glucose fluctuation in 
CGMS system, were 0.81 in the first 24 h and 1.61 in the second 24 h record in 
the patient with GCK-MODY (F3), suggesting little glucose fluctuation.
CONCLUSION: The genetic testing is suggested to be important to differentiate 
GCK-MODY from other types of diabetes. CGMS might be used to screen GCK-MODY 
cases prior to genetic testing.
