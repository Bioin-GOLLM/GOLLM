Androgen receptor signaling is crucial for prostate cancer growth and is 
positively regulated in part by intratumoral CYP3A5. As African American (AA) 
men often carry the wild type CYP3A5 and express high levels of CYP3A5 protein, 
we blocked the wild type CYP3A5 in AA origin prostate cancer cells and tested 
its effect on androgen receptor signaling. q-PCR based profiler assay identified 
several AR regulated genes known to regulate AR nuclear translocation, cell 
cycle progression, and cell growth. CYP3A5 processes several commonly prescribed 
drugs and many of these are CYP3A5 inducers or inhibitors. In this study, we 
test the effect of these commonly prescribed CYP3A5 inducers/inhibitors on AR 
signaling. The results show that the CYP3A5 inducers promoted AR nuclear 
translocation, downstream signaling, and cell growth, whereas CYP3A5 inhibitors 
abrogated them. The observed changes in AR activity is specific to alterations 
in CYP3A5 activity as the effects are reduced in the CYP3A5 knockout background. 
Both the inducers tested demonstrated increased cell growth of prostate cancer 
cells, whereas the inhibitors showed reduced cell growth. Further, 
characterization and utilization of the observation that CYP3A5 inducers and 
inhibitors alter AR signaling may provide guidance to physicians prescribing 
CYP3A5 modulating drugs to treat comorbidities in elderly patients undergoing 
ADT, particularly AA.
