The non-H atoms of the title mol-ecule, C10H10N2O, are essentially coplanar, 
with a maximum deviation of 0.046 (4) Å for the O atom. In the crystal, 
mol-ecules are linked by weak C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming chains along [010]. 
In addtion, weak C-H⋯π inter-actions and π-π stacking inter-actions between 
benzene and pyrimidine rings, with a centroid-centroid distance of 3.730 (3) Å, 
link the chains, forming a two-dimensional network parallel to (001).
