Antiplatelet therapies form the cornerstone of atherothrombosis prevention, 
reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. 
Despite these benefits, there is still an unmet need for more effective and 
safer pharmacological agents. To expedite this process, biological platforms 
that better reflect the intravascular environment in humans will be required in 
order to shorten drug development time, enable better determination of dosing 
regimes, and aid in the design of clinical studies. This article focuses on a 
unique genetically modified animal model that predicts the in vivo response of 
antiplatelet agents in humans more accurately than is currently possible using 
conventional murine models of thrombosis.
