Oropharyngeal (OP) and cloacal (CL) swabs from 2049 adult backyard chickens 
collected at 12 live bird markets, two each in Arusha, Dar es Salaam, Iringa, 
Mbeya, Morogoro and Tanga regions of Tanzania were screened for Newcastle 
disease virus (NDV) using reverse transcription real-time PCR (rRT-PCR). The 
virus was confirmed in 25.23% of the birds (n = 517; rRT-PCR CT ≤ 30), with the 
highest positivity rates observed in birds from Dar es Salaam region with higher 
prevalence during the dry season (September-November 2018) compared to the rainy 
season (January and April-May 2019). Next-generation sequencing of OP/CL samples 
of 20 out of 32 birds that had high amounts of viral RNAs (CT ≤ 25) resulted in 
the assembly of 18 complete and two partial genome sequences (15,192 bp and 
15,045-15,190 bp in length, respectively) of NDV sub-genotypes V.3, VII.2 and 
XIII.1.1 (n = 1, 13 and 4 strains, respectively). Two birds had mixed NDV 
infections (V.3/VII.2 and VII.2/XIII.1.1), and nine were coinfected with viruses 
of families Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, 
Pneumoviridae, and Reoviridae. Of the coinfecting viruses, complete genome 
sequences of two avastroviruses (a recombinant chicken astrovirus antigenic 
group-Aii and avian nephritis virus genogroup-5) and two infectious bronchitis 
viruses (a turkey coronavirus-like recombinant and a GI-19 virus) were 
determined. The fusion (F) protein F1/F2 cleavage sites of the Tanzanian NDVs 
have the consensus motifs 112 RRRKR↓F 117 (VII.2 strains) and 112 RRQKR↓F 117 
(V.3 and XIII.1.1 strains) consistent with virulent virus; virulence was 
confirmed by intracerebral pathogenicity index scores of 1.66-1.88 in 1-day-old 
chicks using nine of the 20 isolates. Phylogenetically, the complete F-gene and 
full genome sequences regionally cluster the Tanzanian NDVs with, but distinctly 
from, other strains previously reported in eastern and southern African 
countries. These data contribute to the understanding of NDV epidemiology in 
Tanzania and the region.
