The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of a large series of 
brain metastatic renal cell carcinoma (BMRCC) patients treated in three Italian 
centers.
METHODS: A total of 120 BMRCC patients with a total of 176 lesions treated were 
evaluated. Patients received surgery plus postoperative HSRS, single-fraction 
SRS, or hypofractionated SRS (HSRS). Local control (LC), brain distant failure 
(BDF), overall survival (OS), toxicities, and prognostic factors were assessed.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 77 months (range 16-235 months). Surgery 
plus HSRS was performed in 23 (19.2%) cases, along with SRS in 82 (68.3%) and 
HSRS in 15 (12.5%). Seventy-seven (64.2%) patients received systemic therapy. 
The main total dose and fractionation used were 20-24 Gy in single fraction or 
32-30 Gy in 4-5 daily fractions. Median LC time and 6 month and 1, 2 and 3 year 
LC rates were nr, 100%, 95.7% ± 1.8%, 93.4% ± 2.4%, and 93.4% ± 2.4%. Median BDF 
time and 6 month and 1, 2 and 3 year BDF rates were n.r., 11.9% ± 3.1%, 25.1% ± 
4.5%, 38.7% ± 5.5%, and 44.4% ± 6.3%, respectively. Median OS time and 6 month 
and 1, 2 and 3 year OS rates were 16 months (95% CI: 12-22), 80% ± 3.6%, 58.3% ± 
4.5%, 30.9% ± 4.3%, and 16.9% ± 3.6, respectively. No severe neurological 
toxicities occurred. Patients with a favorable/intermediate IMDC score, a higher 
RCC-GPA score, an early occurrence of BMs from primary diagnosis, absence of EC 
metastases, and a combined local treatment (surgery plus adjuvant HSRS) had a 
better outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: SRS/HSRS is proven to be an effective local treatment for BMRCC. A 
careful evaluation of prognostic factors is a valid step to manage the optimal 
therapeutic strategy for BMRCC patients.
