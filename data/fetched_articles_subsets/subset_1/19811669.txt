This article focuses on the sessions in which basic science research was 
presented at the XVII International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2008). It also 
provides an analysis of basic science issues which generated significant 
discussion and debate at the conference and are likely to have implications for 
future laboratory and clinical research. Data presented at AIDS 2008 confirmed 
the speed with which HIV establishes latent viral reservoirs following infection 
and the resulting challenges to viral eradication given how effectively HIV 
proviral RNA inserts itself into human DNA within these reservoirs. Studies also 
raised questions about the source of residual viremia and how these might be 
targeted by novel therapeutic approaches.
