A hallmark of CRISPR-Cas immunity systems is the CRISPR array, a genomic locus 
consisting of short, repeated sequences ('repeats') interspersed with short, 
variable sequences ('spacers'). CRISPR arrays are transcribed and processed into 
individual CRISPR RNAs that each include a single spacer, and direct Cas 
proteins to complementary sequences in invading nucleic acid. Most bacterial 
CRISPR array transcripts are unusually long for untranslated RNA, suggesting the 
existence of mechanisms to prevent premature transcription termination by Rho, a 
conserved bacterial transcription termination factor that rapidly terminates 
untranslated RNA. We show that Rho can prematurely terminate transcription of 
bacterial CRISPR arrays, and we identify a widespread antitermination mechanism 
that antagonizes Rho to facilitate complete transcription of CRISPR arrays. 
Thus, our data highlight the importance of transcription termination and 
antitermination in the evolution of bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems.
