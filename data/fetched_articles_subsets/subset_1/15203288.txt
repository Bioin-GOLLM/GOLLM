BACKGROUND: Pharmacological and neurodevelopmental data support the idea that 
the gene, which codes for the 5-HT(5A) receptor is an important candidate gene 
for schizophrenia susceptibility. However, previous genetic studies focusing on 
this gene yielded conflicting results, potentially because of: (i) 
stratification biases of case-control association studies, (ii) genetic and 
phenotypic heterogeneity of schizophrenia, and (iii) variability in the loci 
analyzed (the 5-HT(5A) gene having many polymorphic sites).
METHODS: A transmission disequilibrium test was used in the present study aimed 
at investigating two polymorphisms in exon 1 of the 5-HT(5A) gene, the A12T 
silent substitution and the C43T transversion leading to a 15Pro --> Ser 
substitution, in 103 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia, and their 
206 parents.
RESULTS: We found an excess of transmission of the 12T allele from the parents 
to their affected children (P = 0.02), with evidence for linkage disequilibrium 
between the 12T-43C haplotype and schizophrenia (P = 0.002). Furthermore, 
patients with the 12T allele had a significantly later age at onset (P = 0.003), 
and the Q-TDT approach confirmed that this allele was transmitted with an older 
age at onset (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: These data provided convergent evidence for a significant role of 
the 5-HT(5A) gene in schizophrenia and more specifically in patients with later 
age at onset.
