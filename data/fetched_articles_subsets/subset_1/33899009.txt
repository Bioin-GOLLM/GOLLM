Behavioral analyses using mice chemogenetically manipulated by designer 
receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) are powerful tools 
to elucidate neural functions. Here, we describe the detailed protocols for 
stereotaxic surgery, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated introduction to 
Gq-DREADDs in mice, and for behavioral testing and analyses related to anxiety, 
risk assessment, and burying behaviors. A series of these tests are useful in 
evaluating animal anxiety and their defensive response patterns to potential 
threats. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please 
refer to Horii-Hayashi et al. (2021).
