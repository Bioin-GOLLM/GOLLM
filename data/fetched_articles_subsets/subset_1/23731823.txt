We characterized 9 New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (5 
Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Salmonella 
enterica serovar Senftenberg) isolates identified in the United States and 
cultured from 8 patients in 5 states during April 2009-March 2011. Isolates were 
resistant to β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides, demonstrated MICs 
≤1 µg/mL of colistin and polymyxin, and yielded positive metallo-β-lactamase 
screening results. Eight isolates had blaNDM-1, and 1 isolate had a novel allele 
(blaNDM-6). All 8 patients had recently been in India or Pakistan, where 6 
received inpatient health care. Plasmids carrying blaNDM frequently carried AmpC 
or extended spectrum β-lactamase genes. Two K. pneumoniae isolates and a K. 
pneumoniae isolate from Sweden shared incompatibility group A/C plasmids with 
indistinguishable restriction patterns and a common blaNDM fragment; all 3 were 
multilocus sequence type 14. Restriction profiles of the remaining New Delhi 
metallo-β-lactamase plasmids, including 2 from the same patient, were diverse.
