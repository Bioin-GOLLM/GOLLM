The replacement of each one of the eight serine residues present in the amino 
acid sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein 
YP2 beta (L45) by different amino acids has been performed by heteroduplex 
site-directed mutagenesis in the cloned gene. The mutated DNA was used to 
transform a yeast strain previously deprived of the original protein YP2 beta 
(L45) by gene disruption. The replacement of serine in position 19 by either 
alanine, aspartic acid, or threonine prevents in vivo phosphorylation of the 
protein and its interaction with the ribosome. The serine-19 mutated gene is 
unable to rescue the negative effect on the growth rate caused by elimination of 
the original protein in YP2 beta (L45) gene disrupted strains. The mutation of 
any one of the other seven serine residues has no effect on either the 
phosphorylation or the ribosome binding capacity of the protein, although 
replacement of serine-72 seems to increase the sensitivity of the polypeptide to 
degradation. These results provide strong evidence indicating that ribosomal 
protein phosphorylation plays an important part in the activity of the particle 
and that it supports the existence of a control mechanism of protein synthesis, 
which would regulate the level of phosphorylation of acidic proteins.
