BACKGROUND: ESR1 mutations have been identified as mechanism for endocrine 
resistance and are also associated with a decreased overall survival. We 
assessed ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for impact on outcome 
to taxane-based chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer patients.
METHODS: ESR1 mutations were determined in archived plasma samples from patients 
treated with paclitaxel and bevacizumab (AT arm, N = 91) in the randomized phase 
II ATX study. Samples collected at baseline (n = 51) and at cycle 2 (n = 13, C2) 
were analyzed using a breast cancer next-generation sequencing panel. This study 
was powered to detect a benefit in progression-free survival (PFS) at six months 
for patients treated with paclitaxel/bevacizumab compared to historical trials 
with fulvestrant. PFS, overall survival (OS), and ctDNA dynamics were 
exploratory analyses.
RESULTS: PFS at six months was 86% (18/21) in patients with an ESR1 mutation 
detected and 85% (23/27) in wildtype ESR1 patients. In our exploratory analysis, 
median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.2 months [95% CI, 7.6-8.8] for ESR1 
mutant patients versus 8.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.3-9.2] for 
ESR1 wildtype patients [p = 0.47]. The median overall survival (OS) was 
20.7 months [95% CI, 6.6-33.7] for ESR1 mutant patients versus 28.1 months [95% 
confidence interval (CI), 19.3-36.9] for ESR1 wildtype patients [p = 0.27]. 
Patients with ≥ two ESR1 mutations had a significantly worse OS, but not PFS, 
compared to those who did not [p = 0.003]. Change in ctDNA level at C2 was not 
different between ESR1 and other mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: Presence of ESR1 mutations in baseline ctDNA might not be 
associated with inferior PFS and OS in advanced breast cancer patients treated 
with paclitaxel/bevacizumab.
