A novel heterozygous GTG-->ATG (Val 297-->Met) substitution was detected in an 
individual with probable inherited protein C deficiency and both venous and 
arterial thrombotic disease. The lesion occurs in a highly conserved residue 
within the serine protease domain. In a molecular model of protein C, Met 297 
makes unfavourable interactions with neighbouring residues suggesting that the 
mutant protein is unable to adopt a stable/functional conformation.
