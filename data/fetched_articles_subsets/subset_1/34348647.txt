BACKGROUND: H type hypertension is defined as homocysteine (Hcy) ≥ 10 μmol/L in 
combination with primary hypertension. Studies demonstrated that the existence 
of hyperhomocysteine (HHcy) in hypertensive exacerbates the poor outcome of 
cardiocerebral incidents. This study was to investigate the current epidemic 
situation of H type hypertension and determine the risk factors in order to find 
intervention targets for H type hypertensives.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using cluster sampling design in 
Shanghai, China from July 2019 and April 2020. 23,652 patients with primary 
hypertension were enrolled in this study. Their medical information was 
recorded, and the level of Hcy concentrations and methylenetetrahydrofolate 
reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphisms were detected.
RESULTS: In total, 22,731 of 23,652 patients were recorded. The mean age was 
68.9 ± 8.6 y and 43% were men. 80.0% of the enrolled patients had H type 
hypertension. The frequency of allele T was 40.9%, and the proportions of the 
CC, CT, and TT genotypes were 36.1%, 46.0%, and 17.9%, respectively. Compared 
with the TT genotype, the plasma Hcy concentration levels were lower in patients 
with the CC/CT genotype (18.96 ± 13.48 μmol/L vs. 13.62 ± 5.20/14.28 ± 5.36, 
F = 75.04, p < 0.01). The risk for H type hypertension was higher in elderly 
people. Men had ~ 5.55-fold odds of H type hypertension compared with women. 
Patients with CT genotype and TT genotype had ~ 1.36- and ~ 2.76-fold odds of H 
type hypertension compared with those with CC genotype, respectively. Smoking 
and diabetes were not significantly associated with H type hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of H type hypertension in patients with primary 
hypertension was 80.0%, which was higher than the 75% found in prior report in 
China. Age, gender, and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms rather than smoking and 
diabetes were independently associated with H type hypertension.
