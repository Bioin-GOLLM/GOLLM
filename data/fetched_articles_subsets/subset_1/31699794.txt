More than 50 subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) are recognized in 
the most recent World Health Organization classification of 2016. The current 
treatment paradigm, however, is largely based on 'one-size-fits-all' 
immune-chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this therapeutic strategy is inadequate for 
a significant number of patients. As such, there is an indisputable need for 
novel, preferably targeted, therapies based on a biologically driven 
classification and risk stratification. Sequencing studies identified mutations 
in the MYD88 gene as an important oncogenic driver in B-cell lymphomas. MYD88 
mutations constitutively activate NF-κB and its associated signaling pathways, 
thereby promoting B-cell proliferation and survival. High frequencies of the 
hotspot MYD88(L265P) mutation are observed in extranodal diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma and Waldenström macroglobulinemia, thereby demonstrating this 
mutation's potential as a disease marker. In addition, the presence of mutant 
MYD88 predicts survival outcome in B-NHL subtypes and it provides a therapeutic 
target. Early clinical trials targeting MYD88 have shown encouraging results in 
relapsed/refractory B-NHL. Patients with these disorders can benefit from 
analysis for the MYD88 hotspot mutation in liquid biopsies, as a minimally 
invasive method to demonstrate treatment response or resistance. Given these 
clear clinical implications and the crucial role of MYD88 in lymphomagenesis, we 
expect that analysis of this gene will increasingly be used in routine clinical 
practice, not only as a diagnostic classifier, but also as a prognostic and 
therapeutic biomarker directing precision medicine. This review focuses on the 
pivotal mechanistic role of mutated MYD88 and its clinical implications in 
B-NHL.
