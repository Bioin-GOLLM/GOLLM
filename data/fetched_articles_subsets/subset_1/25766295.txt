Avian influenza viruses that cause infection and are transmissible in humans 
involve changes in the receptor binding site (RBS) of the viral hemagglutinin 
(HA) that alter receptor preference from α2-3-linked (avian-like) to α2-6-linked 
(human-like) sialosides. A human case of avian-origin H6N1 influenza virus was 
recently reported, but the molecular mechanisms contributing to it crossing the 
species barrier are unknown. We find that, although the H6 HA RBS contains D190V 
and G228S substitutions that potentially promote human receptor binding, 
recombinant H6 HA preferentially binds α2-3-linked sialosides, indicating no 
adaptation to human receptors. Crystal structures of H6 HA with avian and human 
receptor analogs reveal that H6 HA preferentially interacts with avian receptor 
analogs. This binding mechanism differs from other HA subtypes due to a unique 
combination of RBS residues, highlighting additional variation in HA-receptor 
interactions and the challenges in predicting which influenza strains and 
subtypes can infect humans and cause pandemics.
