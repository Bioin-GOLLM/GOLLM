Successful mapping of the human genome has sparked a widespread interest in 
deciphering functional information encoded in gene sequences. However, because 
of the high degree of conservation in sequences along with topological and 
biochemical similarities among members of a protein superfamily, uncovering 
physiological role of a particular protein has been a challenging task. Chemical 
genetic approaches have made significant contributions toward understanding 
protein function. One such effort, dubbed the bump-and-hole approach, has 
convincingly demonstrated that engineering at the protein-small molecule 
interface constitutes a powerful method for elucidating the function of a 
specific gene product. By manipulating the steric component of protein-ligand 
interactions in a complementary manner, an orthogonal system is developed to 
probe a specific enzyme-cofactor pair without interference from related members. 
This article outlines current efforts to expand the approach for diverse protein 
classes and their applications. Potential future innovations to address 
contemporary biological problems are highlighted as well.
