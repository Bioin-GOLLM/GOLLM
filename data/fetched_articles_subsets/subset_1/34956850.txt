BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease is a major complication resulting from type 
1 and type 2 diabetes. Currently, the microalbuminuria test is used to monitor 
renal function; however, it does not detect albumin until progressive loss of 
renal function has occurred.
OBJECTIVE: This study analysed the relationship between changes in amino acid 
ratios and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline in diabetic and 
non-diabetic patients.
METHODS: Urine samples were collected from participants between February 2019 to 
April 2019 and analysed from November 2020 to January 2021. Diabetic (glycated 
haemoglobin > 6.4%) and non-diabetic patients (glycated haemoglobin ≤ 6.4%) from 
Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, South Africa, were further categorised based on 
the degree of renal function predicted by the eGFRs. Amino acids were quantified 
using tandem mass spectrometry to determine the concentrations and ratios of 
tyrosine/phenylalanine, ornithine/arginine, arginine/citrulline and 
citrulline/ornithine at different stages of the chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: Among diabetic patients, the tyrosine/phenylalanine ratio showed a 
statistically significant increase (p = 0.04) as the eGFR declined from stage 1 
to stage 4; the ornithine/arginine ratio showed a strong negative correlation 
with eGFR. The citrulline/ornithine ratio differed between the diabetic and 
non-diabetic patients in stage 1 of chronic kidney disease.
CONCLUSION: Amino acid ratios (ornithine/arginine and tyrosine/phenylalanine) 
are affected by the progression of diabetes and can be correlated to renal 
function. The citrulline/ornithine ratios differ between the studied groups in 
stage 1 of the disease and may be utilised to predict the onset of chronic 
kidney disease.
