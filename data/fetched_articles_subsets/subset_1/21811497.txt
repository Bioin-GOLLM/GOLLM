Interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays an indispensable role in mucosal tolerance by 
programming dendritic cells (DCs) to induce suppressor Th-cells. We have tested 
the modulating effect of L. lactis secreting human IL-10 (L.  lactis(IL-10)) on 
DC function in vitro. Monocyte-derived DC incubated with L.  lactis(IL-10) 
induced effector Th-cells that markedly suppressed the proliferation of 
allogenic Th-cells as compared to L. lactis. This suppressive effect was only 
seen when DC showed increased CD83 and CD86 expression. Furthermore, enhanced 
production of IL-10 was measured in both L.  lactis(IL-10)-derived DC and 
Th-cells compared to L. lactis-derived DC and Th-cells. Neutralizing IL-10 
during DC-Th-cell interaction and coculturing L.  lactis(IL-10)-derived 
suppressor Th-cells with allogenic Th-cells in a transwell system prevented the 
induction of suppressor Th-cells. Only 130 pg/mL of bacterial-derived IL-10 and 
40 times more exogenously added recombinant human IL-10 were needed during DC 
priming for the generation of suppressor Th-cells. The spatially restricted 
delivery of IL-10 by food-grade bacteria is a promising strategy to induce 
suppressor Th-cells in vivo and to treat inflammatory diseases.
