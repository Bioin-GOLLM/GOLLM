Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heritable disease. 
Serotonin is one of the neurotransmitters involved in the etiology of ADHD. 
Serotonin-1D receptors are autoreceptors which can regulate the release of 
serotonin in brain, so the HTR1D gene may be predisposing. The current study 
genotyped two variants of HTR1D gene in 272 ADHD trios of Chinese ethnicity, 
that is 1350T > C in the coding region and 1236A > G in 3'-UTR by the use of 
transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). The A allele of the 1236A > G 
polymorphism exhibited both a trend toward preferential transmission to ADHD 
probands (chi2 = 3.815, P = 0.051) and a significant preferential transmission 
to probands of ADHDC (chi2 = 4.198, P = 0.040). Additional polymorphisms in this 
gene need to be studied further.
