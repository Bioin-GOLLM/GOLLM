We have previously shown that when the uridine of a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or 
UGA) is pseudouridylated, the ribosome reads through the modified stop codon. 
However, it is not clear as to whether or not the pseudouridine (Ψ)-mediated 
readthrough is dependent on the sequence context of mRNA. Here, we use several 
different approaches and the yeast system to address this question. We show that 
when a stop codon (premature termination codon, PTC) is introduced into the 
coding region of a reporter mRNA at several different positions (with different 
sequence contexts) and pseudouridylated, we detect similar levels of 
readthrough. Using mutational and selection/screen analyses, we also show that 
the upstream sequence (relative to PTC) as well as the nucleotides surrounding 
the PTC (upstream and downstream) play a minimal role (if at all) in Ψ-mediated 
ribosome readthrough. Interestingly, we detect no suppression of NMD 
(nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) by targeted PTC pseudouridylation in the yeast 
system. Our results indicate that Ψ-mediated nonsense suppression occurs at the 
translational level, and that the suppression is sequence context-independent, 
unlike some previously characterized rare stop codon readthrough events.
