The multicopper oxidases (MCOs) couple four 1e- oxidations of substrate to the 
4e- reduction of O2 to H2O. These divide into two groups: those that oxidize 
organic substrates with high turnover frequencies (TOFs) up to 560 s-1 and those 
that oxidize metal ions with low TOFs, âˆ¼1 s-1 or less. The catalytic mechanism 
of the organic oxidases has been elucidated, and the high TOF is achieved 
through rapid intramolecular electron transfer (IET) to the native intermediate 
(NI), which only slowly decays to the resting form. Here, we uncover the factors 
that govern the low TOF in Fet3p, a prototypical metallooxidase, in the context 
of the MCO mechanism. We determine that the NI decays rapidly under optimal 
turnover conditions, and the mechanism thereby becomes rate-limited by slow IET 
to the resting enzyme. Development of a catalytic model leads to the important 
conclusions that proton delivery to the NI controls the mechanism and enables 
the slow turnover in Fet3p that is functionally significant in Fe metabolism 
enabling efficient ferroxidase activity while avoiding ROS generation.
