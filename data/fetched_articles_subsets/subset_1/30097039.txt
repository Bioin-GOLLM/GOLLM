BACKGROUND: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic 
disease caused by ATP7B gene mutations tat cause excessively high copper levels, 
particularly in the liver and brain. The WD phenotype varies in terms of its 
clinical presentation and intensity. Diagnosing this metabolic disorder is 
important as a lifelong treatment, based on the use of copper chelating agents 
or zinc salts, is more effective if it's started early. Worldwide prevalence of 
WD is variable, with an average of 1/30,000. In France, a recent study based on 
French health insurance data estimated the clinical prevalence of the disease to 
be around 3/200,000.
METHODS: To estimate the genetic prevalence of WD in France, we analysed the 
ATP7B gene by Next Generation Sequencing from a large French cohort of 
indiscriminate subjects.
RESULTS: We observed a high heterozygous carrier frequency of ATP7B in France. 
Among the 697 subjects studied, 18 variants classified as pathogenic or probably 
pathogenic were found at heterozygous level in 22 subjects (22 alleles/1394 
alleles), yielding a prevalence of 0.032 or 1/31 subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: This considerable and unexplained discrepancy between the 
heterozygous carrier frequency and the clinical prevalence of WD may be 
explained by the clinical variability, the incomplete penetrance and the 
existence of modifiers genes. It suggests that the molecular analysis of ATP7B 
should be interpreted with caution, always alongside copper assays 
(ceruloplasmin, relative exchangeable copper, 24 h-urinary copper excretion) 
with particular respect to exome sequencing.
