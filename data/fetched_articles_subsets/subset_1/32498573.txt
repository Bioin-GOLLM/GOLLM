OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequences starting with 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), afatinib and osimertinib, for the treatment of 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive (Exon 19 deletion or 
L858R) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), stages IIIB - IV in Colombia.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was designed, using information from 
global and progression-free survival curves. For first and second-generation 
TKI, second line treatment was assumed according to the presence of T790M 
mutation to define the use of osimertinib or chemotherapy. The cost of the 
states without progression and post-progression was estimated using the base 
case approach, identified through consultation with clinical experts.
RESULTS: The cost of treatment starting with afatinib in the first line was of 
222,247 USD (1 USD = 3171.99 COP) and produced 1.36 QALYs. The strategy with 
afatinib was dominant with respect to that of first line TKI (227,289 USD and 
1.34 QALY). The strategy with osimertinib resulted in more QALYs and higher 
costs, with ICERs of 35,062 USD, exceeding the current willingness to pay 
threshold for Colombia.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment starting with afatinib in the first line is dominant with 
respect to the strategy with first line TKI. The ICER of osimertinib sequence 
exceeds the threshold when compared with afatinib one.
