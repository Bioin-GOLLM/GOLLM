PURPOSE: In order to better define the breast cancer (BC) genetic risk factors 
in men, a germline investigation was carried out on 81 Male BC cases by 
screening the 24 genes involved in BC predisposition, genome stability 
maintenance and DNA repair mechanisms by next-generation sequencing.
METHODS: Germline DNAs were tested in a custom multi-gene panel focused on all 
coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of 24 selected genes using two 
amplicon-based assays on PGM-Ion Torrent (ThermoFisher Scientific) and MiSeq 
(Illumina) platforms. All variants were recorded and classified by using a 
custom pipeline.
RESULTS: Clinical pathological data and the family history of 81 Male BC cases 
were gathered and analysed, revealing the average age of onset to be 61.3Â years 
old and that in 35 cases there was a family history of BC. Our genetic screening 
allowed us to identify a germline mutation in 22 patients (23%) in 4 genes: 
BRCA2, BRIP1, MUTYH and PMS2. Moreover, 12 variants of unknown clinical 
significance (VUS) in 9 genes (BARD1, BRCA1, BRIP1, CHEK2, ERCC1, NBN, PALB2, 
PMS1, RAD50) were predicted as potentially pathogenic by in silico analysis 
bringing the mutation detection rate up to 40%.
CONCLUSION: As expected, a positive family history is a strong predictor of 
germline BRCA2 mutations in male BC. Understanding the potential pathogenicity 
of VUS represents an extremely urgent need for the management of BC risk in Male 
BC cases and their own families.
