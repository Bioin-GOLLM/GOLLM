In response to commentaries, I address questions regarding the proposal that 
general intelligence (g) is a manifestation of the functioning of intramodular 
and intermodular brain networks undergirded by the efficiency of mitochondrial 
functioning (Geary 2018). The core issues include the relative contribution of 
mitochondrial functioning to individual differences in g; studies that can be 
used to test associated hypotheses; and, the adaptive function of intelligence 
from an evolutionary perspective. I attempt to address these and related issues, 
as well as note areas in which other issues remain to be addressed.
