This paper describes an exploratory technique to identify mild dementia by 
assessing the degree of speech deficits. A total of twenty participants were 
used for this experiment, ten patients with a diagnosis of mild dementia and ten 
participants like healthy control. The audio session for each subject was 
recorded following a methodology developed for the present study. Prosodic 
features in patients with mild dementia and healthy elderly controls were 
measured using automatic prosodic analysis on a reading task. A novel method was 
carried out to gather twelve prosodic features over speech samples. The best 
classification rate achieved was of 85% accuracy using four prosodic features. 
The results attained show that the proposed computational speech analysis offers 
a viable alternative for automatic identification of dementia features in 
elderly adults.
