alpha1-Antichymotrypsin (ACT) and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 
(UCH-L1) have been suggested as susceptibility factors for Parkinson's disease 
(PD). We replicated these findings in a Chinese case-control sample consisting 
of 160 PD cases and 160 carefully matched control subjects. Genotypes were 
determined using polymerase chain reaction and BstN1 or Rsa1 restriction enzyme 
assay. Analysis showed no significant difference between PD patients and 
controls for genotype or allele frequencies of the ACT and UCH-L1 S18Y 
polymorphisms. UCH-L1 S18Y polymorphism carriers, however, were found to be 
significantly less frequent in early-onset PD patients with a reduced risk of 
0.557 (95% C.I. = 0.314-0.985; P = 0.043). These data suggest that ACT 
polymorphism does not influence the risk for developing PD. UCH-L1 S18Y 
polymorphism, however, may be a weak protective factor against early-onset PD.
