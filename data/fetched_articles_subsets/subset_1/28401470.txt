After screening marine actinomycetes isolated from sediment samples collected 
from the Arctic fjord Kongsfjorden for potential anticancer activity, an isolate 
identified as Streptomyces artemisiae MCCB 248 exhibited promising results 
against the NCI-H460 human lung cancer cell line. H460 cells treated with the 
ethyl acetate extract of strain MCCB 248 and stained with Hoechst 33342 showed 
clear signs of apoptosis, including shrinkage of the cell nucleus, DNA 
fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Further to this treated cells showed 
indications of early apoptotic cell death, including a significant proportion of 
Annexin V positive staining and evidence of DNA damage as observed in the TUNEL 
assay. Amplified PKS 1 and NRPS genes involved in secondary metabolite 
production showed only 82% similarity to known biosynthetic genes of 
Streptomyces, indicating the likely production of a novel secondary metabolite 
in this extract. Additionally, chemical dereplication efforts using LC-MS/MS 
molecular networking suggested the presence of a series of undescribed tetraene 
polyols. Taken together, these results revealed that this Arctic S. artemisiae 
strain MCCB 248 is a promising candidate for natural products drug discovery and 
genome mining for potential anticancer agents.
