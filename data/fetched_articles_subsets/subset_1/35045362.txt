BACKGROUND: V591 (TMV-083) is a live recombinant measles vector-based vaccine 
candidate expressing a pre-fusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
METHODS: We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I trial with an 
unblinded dose escalation and a double-blind treatment phase at 2 sites in 
France and Belgium to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of V591. Ninety 
healthy SARS-CoV-2 sero-negative adults (18-55 years of age) were randomized 
into 3 cohorts, each comprising 24 vaccinees and 6 placebo recipients. 
Participants received two intramuscular injections of a low dose vaccine 
(1 × 105 median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose [TCID50]), one or two injections 
of a high dose vaccine (1 × 106 TCID50), or placebo with a 28 day interval. 
Safety was assessed by solicited and unsolicited adverse events. Immunogenicity 
was measured by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-binding antibodies, neutralizing 
antibodies, spike-specific T cell responses, and anti-measles antibodies. 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04497298.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 10 and Oct 13, 2020, 148 volunteers were screened of whom 
90 were randomized. V591 showed a good safety profile at both dose levels. No 
serious adverse events were reported. At least one treatment-related adverse 
event was reported by 15 (20.8%) participants receiving V591 vs. 6 (33.3%) of 
participants receiving placebo. Eighty-one percent of participants receiving two 
injections of V591 developed spike-binding antibodies after the second 
injection. However, neutralizing antibodies were detectable on day 56 only in 
17% of participants receiving the low dose and 61% receiving the high dose (2 
injections). Spike-specific T cell responses were not detected. Pre-existing 
anti-measles immunity had a statistically significant impact on the immune 
response to V591, which was in contrast to previous results with the measles 
vector-based chikungunya vaccine.
INTERPRETATION: While V591 was generally well tolerated, the immunogenicity was 
not sufficient to support further development.
