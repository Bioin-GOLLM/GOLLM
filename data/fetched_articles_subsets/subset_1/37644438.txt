Our previous study data suggested that the synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) 
rs3915512 polymorphism is significantly related to clinical performance in 
schizophrenia. The cerebellum exhibits abundant expression of SAP97, which is 
involved with negative symptoms, cognition and emotion in schizophrenia. As 
functional dysconnectivity with the cortical-subcortical-cerebellar circuitry 
has been widely shown in patients with schizophrenia, 
cortical-subcortical-cerebellar dysconnectivity can therefore be considered a 
possible intermediate phenotype that connects risk genes with schizophrenia. In 
this study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was 
applied to evaluate whether the SAP97 rs3915512 polymorphism changes 
cortical/subcortical-cerebellar resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in 
104 Han Chinese subjects (52 first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients and 52 
matched healthy controls (HCs)). To examine RSFC between cortical/subcortical 
regions and the cerebellum, a ROI (region of interest)-wise functional 
connectivity analysis was conducted. The association between abnormal 
cortical/subcortical-cerebellar connectivity and clinical manifestation was 
further assessed in FES patients with different genotypes. The interactive 
effect of disease and genotype on RSFC was found between the frontal gyrus 
(rectus) and cerebellum. A positive correlation was suggested between RSFC in 
the cerebellum and the hostility scores in FES patients with the A allele, and 
no correlation was found in FES patients with the TT genotype. The current 
findings identified that SAP97 may be involved in the process of mental symptoms 
in FES patients via cerebellar connectivity depending on the rs3915512 
polymorphism genotype.
