Mutations in the FKRP gene result in phenotypes with severe forms of congenital 
muscular dystrophies (CMD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies. We present a 
Mexican patient with a pathogenic homozygous mutation in the FKRP gene 
(c.1387A > G, p.Asn463Asp) and CMD with radiological brain anomalies as 
disseminated hyperintensity lesions and discrete generalized cortical atrophy. 
These findings have not been reported to the best of our knowledge in other 
patients with the same mutation. The mutation c.1387A > G, p.Asn463Asp in the 
FKRP gene has been described to have a founder effect in central Mexico, since 
all the patients described to date are of Hispanic origin. Therefore, we 
emphasize studying mutations in the FKRP gene in Hispanic pediatric patients 
with clinical suspicion of CMD. Clinical and molecular diagnosis of specific CMD 
subtypes is needed to help clarify the prognosis, management, and genetic 
counseling to the patient and families.
