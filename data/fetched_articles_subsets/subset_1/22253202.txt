Polymorphisms in the human catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene have been 
widely studied for their role in pain and analgesia. In this study, sensitivity 
to potassium iontophoresis, visual analog scale measurements for fixed twofold 
pain threshold stimulation and pain threshold changes induced by transcutaneous 
electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) were assessed in a population of healthy 
Chinese males. These results were correlated with the alleles of six single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) or diplotypes of common haplotypes designated as 
low pain sensitive, average pain sensitive, and high pain sensitive in the COMT 
gene of these subjects. Our results reveal that the alleles of each SNP are not 
significantly correlated with pain perception except for the rs4633 allele in 
the 2 Hz TEAS session (P < 0.05). In addition, the six diplotypes of COMT 
haplotypes, which cover 92.5% of the Chinese population, are also not correlated 
with pain perception. Moreover, there were no significant differences in pain 
threshold changes induced by 2 and 100 Hz TEAS among the diplotypes of each SNP 
or the various haplotypes. These results suggest that COMT activity do not play 
a significant role in pain perception and TEAS-induced analgesia in the Chinese 
Han male population.
