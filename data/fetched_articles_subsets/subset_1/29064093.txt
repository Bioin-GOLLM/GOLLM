In this case report we assess the occurrence of cortical malformations in 
children with early infantile epilepsy associated with variants of the gene 
protocadherin 19 (PCDH19). We describe the clinical course, and electrographic, 
imaging, genetic, and neuropathological features in a cohort of female children 
with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. All five children (mean age 10y) had an early 
onset of epilepsy during infancy and a predominance of fever sensitive seizures 
occurring in clusters. Cognitive impairment was noted in four out of five 
patients. Radiological evidence of cortical malformations was present in all 
cases and, in two patients, validated by histology. Sanger sequencing and 
Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification analysis of PCDH19 revealed 
pathogenic variants in four patients. In one patient, array comparative genomic 
hybridization showed a microdeletion encompassing PCDH19. We propose molecular 
testing and analysis of PCDH19 in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, with 
onset in early infancy, seizures in clusters, and fever sensitivity. Structural 
lesions are to be searched in patients with PCDH19 pathogenic variants. Further, 
PCDH19 analysis should be considered in epilepsy surgery evaluation even in the 
presence of cerebral structural lesions.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Focal cortical malformations and monogenic epilepsy 
syndromes may coexist. Structural lesions are to be searched for in patients 
with protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) pathogenic variants with refractory focal 
seizures.
