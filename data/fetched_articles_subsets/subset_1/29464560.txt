Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are evolutionarily conserved 
integral membrane proteins. The mammalian TRP superfamily of ion channels 
consists of 28 cation permeable channels that are grouped into six subfamilies 
based on sequence homology (Fig. 6.1). The canonical TRP (TRPC) subfamily is 
known for containing the founding member of mammalian TRP channels. The 
vanilloid TRP (TRPV) subfamily has been extensively studied due to the heat 
sensitivity of its founding member. The melastatin-related TRP (TRPM) subfamily 
includes some of the few known bi-functional ion channels, which contain 
functional enzymatic domains. The ankyrin TRP (TRPA) subfamily consists of a 
single chemo-nociceptor that has been proposed to be a target for analgesics. 
The mucolipin TRP (TRPML) subfamily channels are found primarily in 
intracellular compartments and were discovered based on their critical role in 
type IV mucolipidosis (ML-IV). The polycystic TRP (TRPP) subfamily is a diverse 
group of proteins implicated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease 
(ADPKD). Overall, this superfamily of channels is involved in a vast array of 
physiological and pathophysiological processes making the study of these 
channels imperative to our understanding of subcellular biochemistry.
