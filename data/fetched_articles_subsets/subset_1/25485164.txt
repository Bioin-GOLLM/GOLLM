Clinical disorders known to affect inherited gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) 
metabolism are autosomal recessively inherited succinic semialdehyde 
dehydrogenase and GABA-transaminase deficiency. The clinical presentation of 
succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency includes intellectual disability, 
ataxia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and epilepsy with a nonprogressive course 
in typical cases, although a progressive form in early childhood as well as 
deterioration in adulthood with worsening epilepsy are reported. 
GABA-transaminase deficiency is associated with a severe neonatal-infantile 
epileptic encephalopathy.
