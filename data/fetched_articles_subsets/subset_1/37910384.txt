Necroptosis, a type of programmed cell death that resembles necrosis, is now 
known to depend on a different molecular mechanism from apoptosis, according to 
several recent studies. Many efforts have reported the possible influence of 
necroptosis in human disorders and concluded the crucial role in the 
pathophysiology of various diseases, including liver diseases, renal injuries, 
cancers, and others. Fibrosis is the most common end-stage pathological cascade 
of several chronic inflammatory disorders. In this review, we explain the impact 
of necroptosis and fibrosis, for which necroptosis has been demonstrated to be a 
contributing factor. We also go over the inhibitors of necroptosis and how they 
have been applied to fibrosis models. This review helps to clarify the role of 
necroptosis in fibrosis and will encourage clinical efforts to target this 
pathway of programmed cell death.
