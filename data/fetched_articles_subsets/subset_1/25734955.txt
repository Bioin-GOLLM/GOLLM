PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Human and experimental research has identified 
cardioautonomic and respiratory dysfunction as a frequent accompaniment in human 
and animal model events of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This 
review aims to provide an overview of the scientific evidence behind the 
currently accepted risk factors and working hypotheses regarding SUDEP 
pathophysiology.
RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological analysis of public health burden of SUDEP has 
shown that it rates second only to stroke in the years of potential life lost. 
Clinical and experimental studies uncovered the dynamic cardiorespiratory 
dysfunction interictally and imminently to SUDEP, and model systems have 
facilitated discoveries in SUDEP mechanistic understanding and application of 
pilot therapeutic interventions. Pilot molecular profiling of human SUDEP has 
uncovered complex genomic structure in the candidate gene network.
SUMMARY: Extensive clinical and experimental work has established a rationale 
for the conceptual thinking about SUDEP mechanisms. The application of the 
global molecular profiling will be invaluable in unraveling the individually 
unique genomic complexities and interactions that underlie the physiological 
signature of each patient. At the same time, sophisticated model systems will be 
critical in the iterative translation of human genetics, physiology, 
pharmacological interventions, and in testing preventive interventions.
