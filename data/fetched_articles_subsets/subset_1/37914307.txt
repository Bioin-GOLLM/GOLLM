INTRODUCTION: Lung nodules are one of the most prevalent diseases. Medical 
imaging methods have a high false positive rate for distinguishing malignant 
nodules from benign nodules. Therefore, developing new technologies with high 
accuracy for screening malignant nodules is of great importance for lung nodule 
surveillance. Use of flow cytometry to detect biomarkers in blood macrophages 
(epitop detect in macrophages/macrophages) has opened a new era for early and 
noninvasive diagnosis of cancer. This planned study aims to examine whether the 
peripheral blood macrophage factors Apo10 and TKTL1 accurately distinguish 
malignant nodules from benign nodules.
METHODS AND ANALYSES: We plan to enrol in this study 3825 participants with lung 
nodules who will attend their annual physical examination at Sun Yat-sen 
University Cancer Center. Apo10 and TKTL1 levels in all patients will be tested 
at 60 min after their last meal every 6 months during their 3-year follow-up. 
Biopsy or surgical pathology results will be collected as the gold standard to 
assess the accuracy of Apo10 and TKTL1 in distinguishing malignant nodules from 
benign nodules. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, 
negative predictive value and area under the receiving operating characteristic 
curve will also be evaluated.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the medical ethics committee 
of Sun Yat-sen University (SL-G2022-005-02). The results of this study will be 
disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and presentations at international 
scientific meetings and will also be disseminated to the participants.
