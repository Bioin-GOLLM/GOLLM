In this study, we report the purification, cDNA cloning, and characterization of 
the novel growth hormone-releasing peptide, ghrelin, in the chicken (Gallus 
gallus). Chicken ghrelin is composed of 26 amino acids 
(GSSFLSPTYKNIQQQKDTRKPTARLH) and possesses 54% sequence identity with human 
ghrelin. The serine residue at position 3 (Ser(3)) is conserved between the 
chicken and mammalian species, as its acylation by either n-octanoic or 
n-decanoic acid. Chicken ghrelin mRNA is predominantly expressed in the stomach, 
where it is present in the proventriculus but absent in the gizzard. Using 
RT-PCR analysis, low levels of expression were also detectable in brain, lung, 
and intestine. Administration of chicken ghrelin increases plasma GH levels in 
both rats and chicks, with a potency similar to that of rat or human ghrelin. In 
addition, chicken ghrelin also increases plasma corticosterone levels in growing 
chicks at a lower dose than in mammals. The present results indicate that the 
stimulatory effect of ghrelin on GH secretion is evolutionarily conserved, 
whereas its effect on adrenal function seems to be unique in the chicken.
