BACKGROUND: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are more likely to 
suffer from hypertension. At the same time, the serum levels of matrix 
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and nitric oxide (NO) in patients with OSA are also 
changed in OSA patients. We investigated the correlation between serum levels of 
MMP-9, NO in patients with OSA and their association with hypertension in those 
patients, and the effects of continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) 
on these serum biomarkers and blood pressure.
METHODS: Serum MMP-9 and NO levels and blood pressure of 57 patients with newly 
diagnosed OSA and 30 controls were measured; among them, 30 patients with 
moderate to severe OSA underwent 3-month CPAP treatment.
RESULTS: In comparison to the control group, the MMP-9 serum levels were higher 
(232.8 ± 103.2 ng/ml versus 161.6 ± 56.5 ng/ml, p < .001*), there was no 
statistical significance difference among serum NO (26.7 ± 9.1 IU/ml versus 
31.0 ± 11.7 IU/ml, p = .06), and MMP-9 was negatively correlated to NO, 
especially in patients with hypertension (r = -.644, p = .02*). MMP-9, NO, and 
blood pressure were significantly recovered in the patients with OSA after CPAP 
treatment for 3 months (p < .05*).
CONCLUSION: The MMP-9 level and the NO level were altered in OSA patients. The 
relationship between the two especially in patients with hypertension suggests 
the potential mechanism of OSA-induced hypertension.
