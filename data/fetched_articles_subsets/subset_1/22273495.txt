BACKGROUND: Migraine headache is one of the most common neurological disorders, 
but the pathophysiology contributing to migraine is poorly understood. 
Intracranial interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels have been shown to be elevated during 
migraine attacks, suggesting that this cytokine may facilitate pain signaling 
from the meninges and contribute to the development of headache.
METHODS: Cutaneous allodynia was measured in rats following stimulation of the 
dura with IL-6 alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor, U0126. The number 
of action potentials and latency to the first action potential peak in response 
to a ramp current stimulus as well as current threshold were measured in 
retrogradely-labeled dural afferents using patch-clamp electrophysiology. These 
recordings were performed in the presence of IL-6 alone or in combination with 
U0126. Association between ERK1 and Nav1.7 following IL-6 treatment was also 
measured by co-immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: Here we report that in awake animals, direct application of IL-6 to the 
dura produced dose-dependent facial and hindpaw allodynia. The MEK inhibitor 
U0126 blocked IL-6-induced allodynia indicating that IL-6 produced this 
behavioral effect through the MAP kinase pathway. In trigeminal neurons 
retrogradely labeled from the dura, IL-6 application decreased the current 
threshold for action potential firing. In response to a ramp current stimulus, 
cells treated with IL-6 showed an increase in the numbers of action potentials 
and a decrease in latency to the first spike, an effect consistent with 
phosphorylation of the sodium channel Nav1.7. Pretreatment with U0126 reversed 
hyperexcitability following IL-6 treatment. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation 
experiments demonstrated an increased association between ERK1 and Nav1.7 
following IL-6 treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IL-6 enhances the excitability of dural 
afferents likely via ERK-mediated modulation of Nav1.7 and these responses 
contribute to migraine-related pain behavior in vivo. These data provide a 
cellular mechanism by which IL-6 in the meninges causes sensitization of dural 
afferents therefore contributing to the pathogenesis of migraine headache.
