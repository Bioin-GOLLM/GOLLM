We report the case of a 35-year-old male with COVID-19 encephalitis presenting 
as a stroke mimic with sudden-onset expressive and receptive dysphasia, mild 
confusion and right arm incoordination. The patient received thrombolysis for a 
suspected ischaemic stroke, but later became febrile and SARS-CoV-2 was detected 
in cerebrospinal fluid. Electroencephalography demonstrated excess in slow 
waves, but neuroimaging was reported as normal. Respiratory symptoms were absent 
throughout and nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. At the most 
recent follow-up, the patient had made a full neurological recovery. Clinicians 
should therefore consider testing for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF in patients who present 
with acute focal neurology, confusion and fever during the pandemic, even when 
there is no evidence of respiratory infection.
