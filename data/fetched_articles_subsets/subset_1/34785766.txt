Assembly of bacterial flagellar hook requires FlgD, a protein known to form the 
hook cap. Symmetry mismatch between the hook and the hook cap is believed to 
drive efficient assembly of the hook in a way similar to the filament cap 
helping filament assembly. However, the hook cap dependent mechanism of hook 
assembly has remained poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure 
of the hook cap composed of five subunits of FlgD from Salmonella enterica at 
3.3 Å resolution. The pentameric structure of the hook cap is divided into two 
parts: a stalk region composed of five N-terminal domains; and a petal region 
containing five C-terminal domains. Biochemical and genetic analyses show that 
the N-terminal domains of the hook cap is essential for the hook-capping 
function, and the structure now clearly reveals why. A plausible hook assembly 
mechanism promoted by the hook cap is proposed based on the structure.
