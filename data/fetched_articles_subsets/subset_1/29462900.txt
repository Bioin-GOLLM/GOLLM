Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an almost incurable radio- and 
chemo-resistant tumor, and its microenvironment is characterized by a strong 
desmoplastic reaction associated with a significant infiltration of T regulatory 
lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Tregs, MDSC). Investigating 
immunological targets has identified a number of metabolic and cytoskeletal 
related molecules, which are typically recognized by circulating antibodies. 
Among these molecules we have investigated alpha-enolase (ENO1), a glycolytic 
enzyme that also acts a plasminogen receptor. ENO1 is also recognized by T cells 
in PDA patients, so we developed a DNA vaccine that targets ENO1. This 
efficiently induces many immunological processes (antibody formation and 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)-mediated tumor killing, infiltration of 
effector T cells, reduction of infiltration of myeloid and Treg suppressor 
cells), which significantly increase the survival of genetically engineered mice 
that spontaneously develop pancreatic cancer. Although promising, the ENO1 DNA 
vaccine does not completely eradicate the tumor, which, after an initial growth 
inhibition, returns to proliferate again, especially when Tregs and MDSC ensue 
in the tumor mass. This led us to develop possible strategies for combinatorial 
treatments aimed to broaden and sustain the antitumor immune response elicited 
by DNA vaccination. Based on the data we have obtained in recent years, this 
review will discuss the biological bases of possible combinatorial treatments 
(chemotherapy, PI3K inhibitors, tumor-associated macrophages, ENO1 inhibitors) 
that could be effective in amplifying the response induced by the immune 
vaccination in PDA.
