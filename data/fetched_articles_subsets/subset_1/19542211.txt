OBJECTIVE: There is limited information on whether increased serum uric acid 
levels are independently associated with cardiovascular mortality in type 2 
diabetes. We assessed the predictive role of serum uric acid levels on all-cause 
and cardiovascular mortality in a large cohort of type 2 diabetic individuals.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The cohort included 2,726 type 2 diabetic 
outpatients, who were followed for a mean period of 4.7 years. The independent 
association of serum uric acid levels with all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality was assessed by Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for 
conventional risk factors and several potential confounders.
RESULTS: During follow-up, 329 (12.1%) patients died, 44.1% (n = 145) of whom 
from cardiovascular causes. In univariate analysis, higher serum uric acid 
levels were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause (hazard 
ratio 19 [95% CI 1.12-1.27], P < 0.001) and cardiovascular (1.25 [1.16-1.34], P 
< 0.001) mortality. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, diabetes duration, A1C, medication use (allopurinol or 
hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antiplatelet drugs), 
estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albuminuria, the association of serum 
uric acid with cardiovascular mortality remained statistically significant (1.27 
[1.01-1.61], P = 0.046), whereas the association of serum uric acid with 
all-cause mortality did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum uric acid levels are associated with increased risk of 
cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic patients, independent of several 
potential confounders, including renal function measures.
