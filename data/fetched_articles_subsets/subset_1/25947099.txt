Recognition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway as a key 
mediator of angiogenesis has led to the clinical study of several VEGF and VEGF 
receptor (VEGFR) targeted therapies in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These 
targeted therapies include neutralizing antibodies to VEGF (bevacizumab and 
aflibercept) and VEGFR-2 (ramucirumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
with selectivity for the VEGFRs. Bevacizumab and ramucirumab are associated with 
survival advantages in the treatment of advanced NSCLC: bevacizumab in the 
first-line setting in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel and ramucirumab in 
combination with docetaxel in the second-line setting. The VEGFR-2 TKIs have 
been associated with responses and improved progression-free survival in 
selected NSCLC settings; however, this level of activity has thus far been 
insufficient to confer significant survival advantages. This review will focus 
on the current state of VEGF targeted therapies in NSCLC.
