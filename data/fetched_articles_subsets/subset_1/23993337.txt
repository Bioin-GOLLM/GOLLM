In congenital Chuvash polycythemia (CP), VHL(R200W) homozygosity leads to 
elevated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) levels at normoxia. CP is often treated 
by phlebotomy resulting in iron deficiency, permitting us to examine the 
separate and synergistic effects of iron deficiency and HIF signaling on gene 
expression. We compared peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression 
profiles of eight VHL(R200W) homozygotes with 17 wildtype individuals with 
normal iron status and found 812 up-regulated and 2120 down-regulated genes at 
false discovery rate of 0.05. Among differential genes we identified three major 
gene regulation modules involving induction of innate immune responses, 
alteration of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and down-regulation of cell 
proliferation, stress-induced apoptosis and T-cell activation. These 
observations suggest molecular mechanisms for previous observations in CP of 
lower blood sugar without increased insulin and low oncogenic potential. Studies 
including 16 additional VHL(R200W) homozygotes with low ferritin indicated that 
iron deficiency enhanced the induction effect of VHL(R200W) for 50 genes 
including hemoglobin synthesis loci but suppressed the effect for 107 genes 
enriched for HIF-2 targets. This pattern is consistent with potentiation of 
HIF-1α protein stability by iron deficiency but a trend for down-regulation of 
HIF-2α translation by iron deficiency overriding an increase in HIF-2α protein 
stability.
