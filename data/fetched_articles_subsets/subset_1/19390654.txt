PURPOSE: To study phenotype-genotype correlation in patients who have retinoma, 
which is a benign tumor resembling the post irradiation regression pattern of 
retinoblastoma (RB).
METHODS: We selected patients who had retinoma and positive family history for 
RB and patients who had retinoma in one eye and either retinoma or RB in the 
other eye. The study included 22 patients with available DNA: 18 from 11 
families and four sporadic cases. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood 
leukocytes. The RB1 gene was screened by DHPLC and direct sequencing of the 
promoter and all the exons.
RESULTS: We identified 17 occurrences of 11 distinct germline mutations in two 
sporadic and in 15 familial cases (nine families). The 11 identified mutations 
were located in exons 1, 10,11,13,14, and 19 to 23. Four of the identified 
mutations were not previously reported, including g.64407delT, g.153236A>T, 
g.156743delTCTG, and g.162078delA. Eight out the 11 mutations were truncating 
and three were nontruncating (missense). There was no correlation between the 
type of mutation and the number of tumor foci per eye (RB or retinomas). Highly 
heterogeneous intrafamilial expressivity was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the largest series of mutations of 
consecutive retinoma patients. The present data suggest that the type of 
inherited mutations underlying retinoma is undistinguishable from RB related 
ones, i.e., largely dominated by truncating mutants. This finding is in contrast 
with the RB1 genotypic spectrum of mutations associated with low-penetrance RB, 
i.e., nontruncating mutants. The molecular mechanism underlying low-penetrance 
and attenuated expressivity (retinomas) appeared to be distinct.
