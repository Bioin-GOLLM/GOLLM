Members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily have been shown to 
homo- and hetero-oligomerize both in vitro and in vivo. Although the functional 
and pharmacological significance of GPCR oligomerization is far from being 
completely understood, evidence suggests that, depending on the receptor, 
oligomerization may influence ligand binding, G protein coupling, and receptor 
targeting. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a technique based 
on the complementation of fragments from fluorescent proteins that allows the 
measurement and visualization of protein interactions in living cells. It can be 
extended to the simultaneous detection of distinct protein-protein interactions 
using a multicolor setup. This unit describes the application of BiFC and 
multicolor BiFC to the visualization of GPCR oligomerization in a neuronal cell 
model. Oligomerization of GPCR fusions to BiFC tags is visualized and measured 
using fluorescence microscopy and fluorometry. The effect of ligands on the 
relative formation of distinct oligomeric species is monitored with a 
ratiometric multicolor BiFC approach.
