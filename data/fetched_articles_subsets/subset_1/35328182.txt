Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) are a heterogeneous group of malignant lymphomas 
that can occur in both lymph nodes and extranodal sites. Bone marrow (BM) is the 
most common site of extranodal involvement in NHL. The objective of this study 
is to determine the unique profile of miRNA expression in BM affected by NHL, 
with the possibility of a differential diagnosis of NHL from reactive BM changes 
and acute leukemia (AL). A total of 180 cytological samples were obtained by 
sternal puncture and aspiration biopsy of BM from the posterior iliac spine. All 
the cases were patients before treatment initiation. The study groups were NHL 
cases (n = 59) and AL cases (acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 25) and acute 
myeloid leukemia (n = 49)); the control group consisted of patients with 
non-cancerous blood diseases (NCBDs) (n = 48). We demonstrated that expression 
levels of miRNA-124, miRNA-221, and miRNA-15a are statistically significantly 
downregulated, while the expression level of let-7a is statistically 
significantly upregulated more than 2-fold in BM in NHL compared to those in AL 
and NCBD. ROC analysis revealed that let-7a/miRNA-124 is a highly sensitive and 
specific biomarker for a differential diagnosis of BM changes in NHL from those 
in AL and NCBD. Therefore, we conclude that analysis of miRNA expression levels 
may be a promising tool for early diagnosis of NHL.
