MYCN amplification and overexpression are common in neuroendocrine prostate 
cancer (NEPC). However, the impact of aberrant N-Myc expression in prostate 
tumorigenesis and the cellular origin of NEPC have not been established. We 
define N-Myc and activated AKT1 as oncogenic components sufficient to transform 
human prostate epithelial cells to prostate adenocarcinoma and NEPC with 
phenotypic and molecular features of aggressive, late-stage human disease. We 
directly show that prostate adenocarcinoma and NEPC can arise from a common 
epithelial clone. Further, N-Myc is required for tumor maintenance, and 
destabilization of N-Myc through Aurora A kinase inhibition reduces tumor 
burden. Our findings establish N-Myc as a driver of NEPC and a target for 
therapeutic intervention.
