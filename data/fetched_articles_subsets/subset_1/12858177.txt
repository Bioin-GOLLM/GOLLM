Ion channels respond to changes in transmembrane voltage or ligand concentration 
by opening or closing an activation gate. In voltage-gated K+ channels, this 
gate has been localized to an intracellular bundle crossing. Here we examined 
whether this bundle crossing, or the more internal cytoplasmic pore, acts as a 
gate for PIP2 activation of inward rectifier K+ (Kir) channels expressed in 
Xenopus laevis oocytes. We studied the open/closed state-dependence of the 
accessibility of intracellular cationic modifiers to a position (residue Ile176 
in the TM2 helix of Kir2.1) more external to the bundle crossing. Cd2+ blocked 
I176C mutant channels much more weakly in the closed state than in the open 
state, but Ag+ and sulfhydryl-specific methanethiosulfonate reagents modified 
the channels with similar rates in both states. These results suggest that the 
TM2 helices undergo conformation changes upon PIP2 binding/unbinding, but 
neither they nor the cytoplasmic pore close fully to form a physical gate for K+ 
conduction.
