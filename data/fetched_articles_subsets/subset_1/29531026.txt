Plant-unique membrane receptor kinases with leucine-rich repeat ectodomains 
(LRR-RKs) can sense small molecule, peptide, and protein ligands. Many LRR-RKs 
require SERK-family coreceptor kinases for high-affinity ligand binding and 
receptor activation. How one coreceptor can contribute to the specific binding 
of distinct ligands and activation of different LRR-RKs is poorly understood. 
Here we quantitatively analyze the contribution of SERK3 to ligand binding and 
activation of the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1 and the peptide hormone receptor 
HAESA. We show that while the isolated receptors sense their respective ligands 
with drastically different binding affinities, the SERK3 ectodomain binds the 
ligand-associated receptors with very similar binding kinetics. We identify 
residues in the SERK3 N-terminal capping domain, which allow for selective 
steroid and peptide hormone recognition. In contrast, residues in the SERK3 LRR 
core form a second, constitutive receptor-coreceptor interface. Genetic analyses 
of protein chimera between BRI1 and SERK3 define that signaling-competent 
complexes are formed by receptor-coreceptor heteromerization in planta. A 
functional BRI1-HAESA chimera suggests that the receptor activation mechanism is 
conserved among different LRR-RKs, and that their signaling specificity is 
encoded in the kinase domain of the receptor. Our work pinpoints the relative 
contributions of receptor, ligand, and coreceptor to the formation and 
activation of SERK-dependent LRR-RK signaling complexes regulating plant growth 
and development.
