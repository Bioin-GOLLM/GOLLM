Neurodevelopmental disorders are prevalent, frequently occur in comorbidity and 
share substantial genetic correlation. Previous evidence has suggested a role 
for the ADGRL3 gene in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) 
susceptibility in several samples. Considering ADGRL3 functionality in central 
nervous system development and its previous association with neurodevelopmental 
disorders, we aimed to assess ADGRL3 influence in early-onset ADHD (before 
7 years of age) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The sample comprises 187 men 
diagnosed with early-onset ADHD, 135 boys diagnosed with ASD and 468 male blood 
donors. We tested the association of an ADGRL3 variant (rs6551665) with both 
early-onset ADHD and ASD susceptibility. We observed significant associations 
between ADGRL3-rs6551665 on ADHD and ASD susceptibilities; we found that 
G-carriers were at increased risk of ADHD and ASD, in accordance with previous 
studies. The overall evidence from the literature, corroborated by our results, 
suggests that ADGRL3 might be involved in brain development, and genetic 
modifications related to it might be part of a shared vulnerability factor 
associated with the underlying neurobiology of neurodevelopmental disorders such 
as ADHD and ASD.
