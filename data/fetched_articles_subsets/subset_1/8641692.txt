Hereditary ceruloplasmin deficiency with hemosiderosis (aceruloplasminemia) is a 
new disease characterized by systemic hemosiderosis, diabetes mellitus, 
neurological abnormalities and pigment degeneration of the retina. Loss of the 
ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin results in systemic iron deposition and 
tissue damage. Neuroimaging studies reveal iron deposition in basal ganglia and 
in the red and dentate nuclei. Cerebellar ataxia, extrapyramidal signs and 
dementia develop after middle age. We report a patient with undetectable serum 
ceruloplasmin levels and the above clinical manifestations. Sequence analysis of 
the cDNA of ceruloplasmin from this patient revealed an insertion of adenine in 
exon 3; this produced a premature stop codon.
