BACKGROUND: Preclinical data suggest that oncogene (EGFR and KRAS) events 
regulate tumor procoagulant activity. However, few studies have prospectively 
investigated the clinical relevance between the presence of EGFR or KRAS 
mutations and occurrence of venous thromboembolism(VTE) in patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: A total of 605 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC were 
included and were followed for a maximum period of 4.5 years. EGFR and KRAS 
mutations were determined by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase 
chain reaction method at inclusion. The main outcome was objectively confirmed 
VTE.
RESULTS: Of the 605 patients, 40.3% (244) had EGFR mutations and 10.2% (62) of 
patients had KRAS mutations. In multivariable analysis including age, sex, tumor 
histology, tumor stage, performance status, EGFR and KRAS status, EGFR wild-type 
(sub-distribution hazard ratio 1.81, 95% confidence interval 1.07-3.07) were 
associated with the increased risk of VTE. In competing risk analysis, the 
probability of developing VTE was 8.3% in those with and 13.2% in those without 
EGFR mutations after 1 year; after 2 years, the corresponding risks were 9.7 and 
15.5% (Gray test P = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: EGFR mutations have a negative association with the risk of VTE in 
Chinese patients with NSCLC.
