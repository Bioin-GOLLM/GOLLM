Recent studies have highlighted a role of HER3 in ER and HER2-driven breast 
cancers. We sought to investigate the role of patient-derived HER3 mutations in 
ER+ and HER2+ breast cancer cells using ectopic expression of HER3 mutants. We 
found that HER3T355I mutant is activating with increased cell proliferation in 
ER+ T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells lacking HER2 over-expression. 
Immunoblotting and receptor tyrosine kinase array results indicated that T47D 
and MCF-7 cells expressing HER3T355I had increased p-HER4 and p-HER1 expression. 
Our data showed that HER3T355I induced cell proliferation is via 
HER4/HER1-dependent ERK1/2 and cyclinD1 mediated pathways in ER+ cells. ERα 
expression is upregulated in ER+ cells expressing HER3T355I mutant. We noted 
crosstalk between ERα and HER3 in T47D cells. Several HER3 mutants (F94L, G284R, 
D297Y, T355I, and E1261A) acquired a gain-of-function phenotype in MCF10AHER2 
cells and were resistant to lapatinib. These mutants increased HER2-HER3 
heterodimerization. Knocking down HER3 from ovarian and colorectal cancers with 
endogenous HER3 mutations abrogated cancer cell proliferation. Overall, this 
study provides the first systematic assessment of how mutations in HER3 affect 
response of ER+ and HER2+ breast cancers to clinically relevant inhibitors and 
finds that HER3 mutations can be activating independent of HER2 over-expression.
