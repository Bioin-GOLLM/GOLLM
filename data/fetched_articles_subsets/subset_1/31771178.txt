Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality among 
women around the world. Conventional treatments in the fight against breast 
cancer, such as chemotherapy, are being challenged regarding their 
effectiveness. Thus, strategies for the treatment of breast cancer need to be 
continuously refined to achieve a better patient outcome. We know that a number 
of bacteria are pathogenic and some are even associated with tumor development, 
however, recent studies have demonstrated interesting results suggesting some 
bacteria may have potential for cancer therapy. Therefore, the therapeutic role 
of bacteria has aroused attention in medical and pharmaceutical studies. 
Furthermore, genetic engineering has been used in bacterial therapy and may led 
to greater efficacy with few side effects. Some genetically modified 
non-pathogenic bacterial species are more successful due to their selectivity 
for cancer cells but with low toxicity for normal cells. Some live, attenuated, 
or genetically modified bacterias are capable to multiply in tumors and inhibit 
their growth. This article aims to review the role of bacteria and their 
products including bacterial peptides, bacteriocins, and toxins for the 
treatment of breast cancer.
