Multiple nonmalignant cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME) impact 
breast cancer risk, metastasis, and response to therapy, yet most heritable 
mechanisms that influence TME cell function and breast cancer outcomes are 
largely unknown. Breast cancer risk is ∼30% heritable and >170 genetic loci have 
been associated with breast cancer traits. However, the majority of candidate 
genes have poorly defined mechanistic roles in breast cancer biology. Research 
indicates that breast cancer risk modifiers directly impact cancer cells, yet it 
is equally plausible that some modifier alleles impact the nonmalignant TME. The 
objective of this review is to examine the list of current breast cancer 
candidate genes that may modify breast cancer risk and outcome through the TME.
