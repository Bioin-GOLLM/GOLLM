Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) is an evolutionarily conserved and essential Ser/Thr 
phosphatase that regulates cell division, development and DNA repair in 
eukaryotes. The major form of PP4, present from yeast to human, is the 
PP4c-R2-R3 heterotrimeric complex. The R3 subunit is responsible for 
substrate-recognition via its EVH1 domain. In typical EVH1 domains, conserved 
phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan residues form the specific recognition 
site for their target's proline-rich sequences. Here, we identify novel binding 
partners of the EVH1 domain of the Drosophila R3 subunit, Falafel, and 
demonstrate that instead of binding to proline-rich sequences this EVH1 variant 
specifically recognizes atypical ligands, namely the FxxP and MxPP short linear 
consensus motifs. This interaction is dependent on an exclusively conserved 
leucine that replaces the phenylalanine invariant of all canonical EVH1 domains. 
We propose that the EVH1 domain of PP4 represents a new class of the EVH1 family 
that can accommodate low proline content sequences, such as the FxxP motif. 
Finally, our data implicate the conserved Smk-1 domain of Falafel in 
target-binding. These findings greatly enhance our understanding of the 
substrate-recognition mechanisms and function of PP4.
