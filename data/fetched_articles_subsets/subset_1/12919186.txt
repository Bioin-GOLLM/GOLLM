AIMS: To identify the molecular basis for a low CYP1A2 metabolic status, as 
determined by a caffeine phenotyping test, in a 71-year-old, nonsmoking, 
Caucasian woman who presented with very high clozapine concentrations despite 
being administered a standard dose of the drug.
METHODS: The nucleotide sequence of the 7 exons, exon-intron boundaries and 
5'-flanking region of the CYP1A2 gene was analysed by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: Only one heterozygous point mutation was identified in the donor splice 
site of intron 6 (3534G > A) of CYP1A2. This mutation could cause abnormal RNA 
splicing and therefore lead to a truncated nonfunctional enzyme. No other 
carrier of this mutation was identified in a population of 100 unrelated healthy 
Caucasians.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a splice-site mutation affecting the 
CYP1A2 gene. This polymorphism is a likely explanation for the low CYP1A2 
activity associated with high clozapine concentrations in this patient.
