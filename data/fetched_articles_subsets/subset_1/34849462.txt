Fibrosis-driven solid organ failure is an enormous burden on global health. 
Spiny mice (Acomys) are terrestrial mammals that can regenerate severe skin 
wounds without scars to avoid predation. Whether spiny mice also regenerate 
internal organ injuries is unknown. Here, we show that despite equivalent acute 
obstructive or ischemic kidney injury, spiny mice fully regenerate nephron 
structure and organ function without fibrosis, whereas C57Bl/6 or CD1 mice 
progress to complete organ failure with extensive renal fibrosis. Two mechanisms 
for vertebrate regeneration have been proposed that emphasize either extrinsic 
(pro-regenerative macrophages) or intrinsic (surviving cells of the organ 
itself) controls. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that the Acomys 
genome appears poised at the time of injury to initiate regeneration by 
surviving kidney cells, whereas macrophage accumulation was not detected until 
about day 7. Thus, we provide evidence for rapid activation of a gene expression 
signature for regenerative wound healing in the spiny mouse kidney.
