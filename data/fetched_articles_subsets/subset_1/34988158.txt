BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested the YKL-40/chitinase 3-like protein 
1 protein is upregulated in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with 
fibrosis. We sought to determine whether HCV regulates YKL-40 expression and to 
elucidate the mechanisms by which YKL-40 mediates the liver fibrosis caused by 
HCV infection.
METHODS: We used purified protein, small molecule inhibitors and 
short-interfering RNAs to over-express or knock down certain kinases to explore 
the mechanisms underlying the regulation by HCV of YKL-40 expression in the 
Japanese fulminant hepatitis 1 (JFH1) model.
RESULTS: HCV induced YKL-40 production in hepatic parenchymal cells. Further, 
HCV-mediated upregulation of YKL-40 through cooperative induction of tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mitogen-activated 
protein kinase MAPKs, which are nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent pathways. 
YKL-40 protein also mildly increased HCV replication, triggering hepatic 
profibrogenic cytokine release and cellular viability as feedback. Additionally, 
hepatic parenchymal cells were the sole source of YKL-40 production in the 
infectious JFH1 model, whereas YKL-40 was under-detected in hepatic stellate 
cells (HSCs) in the presence or absence of the JFH1 supernatant, which was not 
investigated so far.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV induced and maintained secretion of YKL-40 through sustained 
activation of NF-κB via cooperative induction of the TNF-α and ROS-MAPKs 
pathways. HCV interacted with YKL-40 to enhance the progression of hepatic 
fibrosis. These findings support a potential role for blockade of YKL-40 as an 
antifibrotic strategy.
