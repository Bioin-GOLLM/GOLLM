Exosomes are a new horizon in modern therapy, presenting exciting new 
opportunities for advanced drug delivery and targeted release. Exosomes are 
small extracellular vesicles with a size range of 30-100 nm, secreted by all 
cell types in the human body and carrying a unique collection of DNA fragments, 
RNA species, lipids, protein biomarkers, transcription factors and metabolites. 
miRNAs are one of the most common RNA species in exosomes, and they play a role 
in a variety of biological processes including exocytosis, hematopoiesis and 
angiogenesis, as well as cellular communication via exosomes. Exosomes can act 
as cargo to transport this information from donor cells to near and 
long-distance target cells, participating in the reprogramming of recipient 
cells.
