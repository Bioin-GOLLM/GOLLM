Despite of the great success of imatinib as the first-line treatment for GISTs, 
the majority of patients will develop drug-acquired resistance due to secondary 
mutations in the cKIT kinase. Sunitinib and regorafenib have been approved as 
the second and third line therapies to overcome some of these drug-resistance 
mutations; however, their limited clinical response, toxicity and resistance of 
the activation loop mutants still makes new therapies bearing different cKIT 
mutants activity spectrum profile highly demanded. Through a drug repositioning 
approach, we found that cabozantinib exhibited higher potency than imatinib 
against primary gain-of-function mutations of cKIT. Moreover, cabozantinib was 
able to overcome cKIT gatekeeper T670I mutation and the activation loop 
mutations that are resistant to imatinib or sunitinib. Cabozantinib demonstrated 
good efficacy in vitro and in vivo in the cKIT mutant-driven preclinical models 
of GISTs while displaying a long-lasting effect after treatment withdrawal. 
Furthermore, it also exhibited dose-dependent anti-proliferative efficacy in the 
GIST patient derived primary cells. Considering clinical safety and PK profile 
of cabozantinib, this report provides the basis for the future clinical 
applications of cabozantinib as an alternative anti-GISTs therapy in precision 
medicine.
