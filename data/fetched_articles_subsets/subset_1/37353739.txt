BACKGROUND: The pathological basis for many retinal diseases, retinal ischemia 
is also one of the most common causes of visual impairment. Numerous ocular 
diseases have been linked to Endoplasmic reticulum(ER)stress. However, there is 
still no clear understanding of the relationship between ER stress and Müller 
glial cells during retinal ischemia and hypoxia. This study examined the effects 
of ER stress on autophagy and apoptosis-related proteins, as well as the 
microtubule-related protein tau in rMC-1 cells.
METHODS: rMC-1 cells were cultured in vitro. RT-PCR、immunofluorescence and 
Western blotting revealed the expression levels of associated mRNAs and 
proteins, and the CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays detected cell apoptosis.
RESULTS: The results showed that under OGD(Oxygen-glucose deprivation) 
conditions, the number of rMC-1 cells was decreased, the PERK/eIF2a pathway was 
activated, and the expressions of p-tau, LC3、Beclin1 and Caspase-12 proteins 
were increased. After the PERK knockout, the expression of the above proteins 
was decreased, and the apoptosis was also decreased.
CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this study, specific downregulation of 
PERK expression had an anti-apoptotic effect on OGD-conditioned rMC-1 cells. 
There is a possibility that this is one of the mechanisms of MG cell apoptosis 
during retinal ischemic injury.
