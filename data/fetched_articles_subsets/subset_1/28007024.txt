Cancer results from the acquisition of somatic driver mutations. Several 
computational tools can predict driver genes from population-scale genomic data, 
but tools for analyzing personal cancer genomes are underdeveloped. Here we 
developed iCAGES, a novel statistical framework that infers driver variants by 
integrating contributions from coding, non-coding, and structural variants, 
identifies driver genes by combining genomic information and prior biological 
knowledge, then generates prioritized drug treatment. Analysis on The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) data showed that iCAGES predicts whether patients respond to 
drug treatment (P = 0.006 by Fisher's exact test) and long-term survival 
(P = 0.003 from Cox regression). iCAGES is available at http://icages.wglab.org
