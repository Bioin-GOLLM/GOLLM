Strong evidence implicates the complement pathway as an important contributor to 
amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the role of complement 
in tau modulation remains unclear. Here we show that the expression of C3 and 
C3a receptor (C3aR1) are positively correlated with cognitive decline and Braak 
staging in human AD brains. Deletion of C3ar1 in PS19 mice results in the rescue 
of tau pathology and attenuation of neuroinflammation, synaptic deficits, and 
neurodegeneration. Through RNA sequencing and cell-type-specific transcriptomic 
analysis, we identify a C3aR-dependent transcription factor network that 
regulates a reactive glial switch whose inactivation ameliorates 
disease-associated microglia and neurotoxic astrocyte signatures. Strikingly, 
this C3aR network includes multiple genes linked to late-onset AD. 
Mechanistically, we identify STAT3 as a direct target of C3-C3aR signaling that 
functionally mediates tau pathogenesis. All together our findings demonstrate a 
crucial role for activation of the C3-C3aR network in mediating 
neuroinflammation and tau pathology.
