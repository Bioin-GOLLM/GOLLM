Nucleoside diphosphate kinase from a moderate halophile Halomonas sp. 593 
(HaNDK) is dimer, while NDK from different origins has been shown to assemble 
into hexamer, or tetramer. Similar to HaNDK, halophilic NDK from 
Chromohalobacter salexigens DSM3043 (CsNDK) formed dimeric structure. 
Cysteine139 conserved between HaNDK and CsNDK is located in the monomer/monomer 
interface. Substitution of Cys139 for Ser caused dissociation of dimeric CsNDK 
into monomer in Tris buffer, as determined by field flow fractionation 
technique. Circular dichroism (CD) profile of the mutant CsNDK was nearly 
identical to the wild type CsNDK: however, the mutant CsNDK became more 
susceptible to "endproteinase GluC" cleavage, which could be suppressed by an 
NDK substrate, ATP. The monomer was enzymatically active, although it is 
possible that active structure is dimer in the presence of substrate.
