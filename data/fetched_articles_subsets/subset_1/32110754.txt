BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Higher resting heart rate is a risk factor for arterial 
cardiovascular diseases. We assessed whether higher heart rate is a risk factor 
for venous thromboembolism (VTE).
METHODS: In a prospective epidemiologic cohort, the Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities (ARIC) Study, we associated resting heart rate by electrocardiogram 
with physician-validated incident hospitalized VTE through 2015. We also 
examined whether lower heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac 
autonomic imbalance, might be a risk factor for VTE.
RESULTS: Resting heart rate at Visit 1 (1987-1989), when participants were 45 to 
64 years old (mean, 54 years), was not associated with incidence of VTE (n = 882 
cases). However, heart rate at Visit 4 (1996-1998; mean age, 63 years) was 
associated positively with VTE (n = 557 cases). The adjusted hazard ratios (95% 
confidence intervals) of VTE across Visit 4 heart rate categories of <60, 60 to 
69, 70 to 79, and ≥80 bpm were 1 (reference), 1.22 (1.01-1.49), 1.39 
(1.09-1.78), and 1.44 (1.01-2.06), respectively, and when evaluated continuously 
1.11 (1.02-1.21) per 10 bpm greater heart rate. For the most part, HRV indices 
were not associated with VTE or associations were explained by inverse 
correlations of HRV indices with heart rate.
CONCLUSION: We found a significant positive and independent association of 
resting heart rate at ARIC Visit 4 with incidence of VTE. The reason why high 
heart rate is a risk marker for VTE warrants further exploration.
