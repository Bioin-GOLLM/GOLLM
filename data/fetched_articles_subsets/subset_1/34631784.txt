Background: GLI-Kruppel family member 3 (GLI3), a zinc finger transcription 
factor of the sonic hedgehog pathway, is essential for organ development. 
Mutations in GLI3 cause several congenital conditions, including Pallister-Hall 
syndrome (PHS), which is characterized by polydactyly and hypothalamic 
hamartoma. Most patients are diagnosed soon after birth, and surgical removal of 
hypothalamic hamartoma in the very young is rarely performed because of 
associated risks. Case presentation: A 7-month-old boy with PHS features, 
including a suprasellar lesion, bifid epiglottis, tracheal diverticulum, 
laryngomalacia, left-handed polydactyly and syndactyly, and omental hernia was 
referred to our service. His suprasellar lesion was partially removed, and 
whole-exome sequencing was applied to the resected tumor, his peripheral blood, 
and blood from his parents. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of 
hypothalamic hamartoma, and molecular profiling revealed a likely pathogenic de 
novo variant, c.2331C>G (p. H777Q), in GLI3. Magnetic resonance imaging 
follow-up 1 year later showed some residual tumor, and the patient experienced 
normal development post operation. Conclusions: We presented a case of PHS that 
carries a novel GLI3 variant. Hypothalamic hamartoma showed a distinct genetic 
landscape from germline DNA. These data offer insights into the underlying 
etiology of hypothalamic hamartoma development in patients with PHS.
