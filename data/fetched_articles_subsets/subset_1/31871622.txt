AIM: To describe treatment patterns among patients with stage III melanoma who 
underwent surgical excision in years 2011-2016, and assess outcomes among 
patients who subsequently received systemic adjuvant therapy versus 
watch-and-wait.
METHODS: Chart review of 380 patients from 17 melanoma centers in North America, 
South America and Europe.
RESULTS: Of 129 (34%) patients treated with adjuvant therapy, 85% received 
interferon α-2b and 56% discontinued treatment (mostly due to adverse events). 
Relapse-free survival was significantly longer for patients treated with 
adjuvant therapy versus watch-and-wait (hazard ratio = 0.63; p < 0.05). There 
was considerable heterogeneity in adjuvant treatment schedules and doses. 
Similar results were found in patients who received interferon-based adjuvant 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: Adjuvant therapies with better safety/efficacy profiles will improve 
clinical outcomes in patients with stage III melanoma.
