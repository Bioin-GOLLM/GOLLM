The objective of this clinical-pathologic study was to identify biomarkers for a 
pallidopontonigral degeneration (PPND) kindred of frontotemporal dementia and 
parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) harboring the N279K tau mutation. 
Five affected subjects, one at-risk who later became symptomatic, and one 
at-risk asymptomatic mutation carrier, had abnormal (18)fluorodeoxyglucose PET 
demonstrating asymmetric temporal lobe hypometabolism. All except the 
asymptomatic mutation carrier had abnormal brain MRI. Parkinsonism, myoclonus, 
anosmia, insomnia, speech, and autonomic dysfunction were identified. Autopsy of 
six affected subjects showed frontotemporal degeneration with extensive 
tauopathy. Further studies of FTDP-17 patients are needed to replicate these 
findings.
