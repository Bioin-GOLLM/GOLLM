Gastric and esophageal (GE) adenocarcinomas are the third and sixth most common 
causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, accounting for greater than 1.25 
million annual deaths. Despite the advancements in the multi-disciplinary 
treatment approaches, the prognosis for patients with GE adenocarcinomas remains 
poor, with a 5-year survival of 32% and 19%, respectively, mainly due to the 
late-stage diagnosis and aggressive nature of these cancers. Premalignant 
lesions characterized by atypical glandular proliferation, with neoplastic cells 
confined to the basement membrane, often precede malignant disease. We now 
appreciate that premalignant lesions also carry cancer-associated mutations, 
enabling disease progression in the right environmental context. A better 
understanding of the premalignant-to-malignant transition can help us diagnose, 
prevent, and treat GE adenocarcinoma. Here, we discuss the evidence suggesting 
that alterations in TP53 occur early in GE adenocarcinoma evolution, are 
selected for under environmental stressors, are responsible for shaping the 
genomic mechanisms for pathway dysregulation in cancer progression, and lead to 
potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a specific class of targeted 
therapy.
