RNA-binding motif protein 10 (RBM10) is an RNA-binding protein frequently 
deleted or mutated in lung cancer cells. Recent reports showed that the 
knockdown of RBM10 in human cancer cells enhances the growth of mouse tumor 
xenografts, suggesting that RBM10 acts as a tumor suppressor. RBM10 also 
regulates alternative splicing and controls cancer cell proliferation. However, 
the underlying molecular mechanisms for its tumor suppression role remain 
largely unclear. Here, we for the first time report that RBM10 can induce 
apoptosis and inhibit cancer cell proliferation by activating p53. Our analysis 
of cancer genomic databases showed that patients with wild-type RBM10 and p53 
survive longer than do those with mutated p53 or less RBM10. RBM10 
overexpression markedly inhibited mitochondrial respiration, cell migration and 
proliferation of various cancer cells that harbor wild-type p53. Also, RBM10 
overexpression elongated p53's half-life by disrupting MDM2-p53 interaction and 
subsequently repressing p53 ubiquitination, whereas knockdown of RBM10 decreased 
p53 stability. Altogether, our results demonstrate that RBM10 inhibits cancer 
cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in part by blocking the MDM2-p53 
feedback loop.
