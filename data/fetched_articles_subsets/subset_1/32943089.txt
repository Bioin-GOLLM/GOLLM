BACKGROUND: Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a promising biomarker of 
neurodegeneration in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. This study investigated 
the presence of NfL in the vitreous humor and its associations with amyloid 
beta, tau, inflammatory cytokines and vascular proteins, apolipoprotein E (APOE) 
genotypes, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, systemic disease, and 
ophthalmic diseases.
METHODS: This is a single-site, prospective, cross-sectional cohort study. 
Undiluted vitreous fluid (0.5-1.0 mL) was aspirated during vitrectomy, and whole 
blood was drawn for APOE genotyping. NfL, amyloid beta (Aβ), total Tau (t-Tau), 
phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau181), inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and vascular 
proteins in the vitreous were quantitatively measured by immunoassay. The main 
outcome measures were the detection of NfL levels in the vitreous humor and its 
associations with the aforementioned proteins. Linear regression was used to 
test the associations of NfL with other proteins, APOE genotypes, MMSE scores, 
and ophthalmic and systemic diseases after adjustment for age, sex, education 
level, and other eye diseases.
RESULTS: NfL was detected in all 77 vitreous samples. NfL was not found to be 
associated with ophthalmic conditions, APOE genotypes, MMSE scores, or systemic 
disease (p > 0.05). NfL levels were positively associated with increased 
vitreous levels of Aβ40 (p = 7.7 × 10-5), Aβ42 (p = 2.8 × 10-4), and t-tau 
(p = 5.5 × 10-7), but not with p-tau181 (p = 0.53). NfL also had significant 
associations with inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-15 (IL-15, 
p = 5.3 × 10-4), IL-16 (p = 2.2 × 10-4), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 
(MCP1, p = 4.1 × 10-4), and vascular proteins such as vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR1, p = 2.9 × 10-6), Vegf-C (p = 8.6 × 10-6), 
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, p = 5.0 × 10-4), Tie-2 
(p = 6.3 × 10-4), and intracellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1, 
p = 1.6 × 10-4).
CONCLUSION: NfL is detectable in the vitreous humor of the eye and significantly 
associated with amyloid beta, t-tau, and select inflammatory and vascular 
proteins in the vitreous. Additionally, NfL was not associated with patients' 
clinical eye condition. Our results serve as a foundation for further 
investigation of NfL in the ocular fluids to inform us about the potential 
utility of its presence in the eye.
