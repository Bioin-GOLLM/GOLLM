The acid β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme cleaves glucosylceramide into 
glucose and ceramide. Loss of function variants in the gene encoding for GCase 
can lead to Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease. Therapeutic strategies 
aimed at increasing GCase activity by targeting a modulating factor are 
attractive and poorly explored. To identify genetic modifiers, we measured 
hepatic GCase activity in 27 inbred mouse strains. A genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) using GCase activity as a trait identified several candidate 
modifier genes, including Dmrtc2 and Arhgef1 (p=2.1x10-7), and Grik5 
(p=2.1x10-7). Bayesian integration of the gene mapping with transcriptomics was 
used to build integrative networks. The analysis uncovered additional candidate 
GCase regulators, highlighting modules of the acute phase response 
(p=1.01x10-8), acute inflammatory response (p=1.01x10-8), fatty acid 
beta-oxidation (p=7.43x10-5), among others. Our study revealed previously 
unknown candidate modulators of GCase activity, which may facilitate the design 
of therapies for diseases with GCase dysfunction.
