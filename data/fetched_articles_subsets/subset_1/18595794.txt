We conducted clinical and genetic studies in a large Chinese family with 
nail-patella syndrome (NPS) involving multi-organ (such as limb, renal and eye) 
and investigated the functional consequences of a novel LMX1B mutation 
identified in the family. Twenty individuals at risk for inheriting NPS in the 
Chinese family participated in the study and a physical examination was 
performed and blood was drawn for DNA extraction. Linkage analysis and mutation 
screening of LMX1B gene were performed and the functional study in vitro for the 
mutation was conducted by luciferase assay. The disease phenotype of this family 
was linked to D9S290 with LOD Score=5.8 at theta=0; a novel mutation 742 A>G 
(R248G) within the homeodomain was found in a conserved site and co-segregated 
with the disease phenotype of the family. The functional study in vitro by 
luciferase assay indicated that the R248G mutation within the binding domain of 
the gene affected the transactivation. This is the first report that a mutation 
in the LMX1B gene causes NPS in a Chinese population, which will expand the 
spectrum of mutations in the LMX1B gene and provide insight into the underlining 
pathology of NPS.
