At our institution, implementation of a formal training course in Basic Focus 
Assessed Transthoracic Echocardiography (FATE) was associated with an 
improvement in anesthesia trainees' ability to obtain transthoracic 
echocardiography (TTE) images. Total image acquisition scores improved by a 
median (Q1, Q3) 9.1 (2.9,14.7) percentage points from pre-to post-hands-on FATE 
course (n=20; p=0.001). Participants who returned for a subsequent assessment 5 
months following the course demonstrated a median (Q1, Q3) 18.0 (9.1,22.1) 
percentage point improvement from their pre-course total image acquisition 
scores (n=11; p=0.002). This pilot study established the feasibility of our 
program and results suggest that the basic FATE course can be used to teach 
trainees TTE quickly, effectively, and with significant retention.
