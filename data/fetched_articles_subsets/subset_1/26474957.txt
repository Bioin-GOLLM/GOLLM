INTRODUCTION: Smoking status is an important determinant of the prevalence of 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in lung cancer patients. 
However, it is unclear whether smoking status could also influence the spectrum 
of EGFR mutations.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with lung adenocarcinoma from three medical 
centers in Taiwan. EGFR mutations were assessed by Sanger direct sequencing. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of smoking status on both 
the frequency and patterns of EGFR mutations.
RESULTS: From 2001 to 2013, a total of 1175 patients with lung adenocarcinoma 
were enrolled for EGFR mutation analysis. The overall EGFR mutation rate was 
59.6%, which was significantly higher in females than males (69.1% vs. 49.8%) 
and in non-smokers than current/former smokers (73.8% vs. 29.8%) (both P<0.001). 
Among patients harboring EGFR mutations, smokers expressed L858R mutation less 
frequently (35.2% vs. 50.2%, P=0.005) and exon 19 deletions more frequently 
(52.8% vs 38.8%, P=0.008) than non-smokers. Smokers and non-smokers also had 
divergent exon 19 deletions subtypes (Del E746-A750 82.5% vs. 57.6%, 
respectively, P<0.001). Among subgroup patients harboring the L858R mutation, 
smokers were associated with a higher rate of complex mutations than non-smokers 
(34.2% vs. 8.4%, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that smoking status could influence not only 
the frequency but also the spectrum of EGFR mutations. These findings provide a 
clue for further investigation of EGFR mutagenesis.
