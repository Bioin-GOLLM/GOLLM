Recent evidence links dysfunctional lipid metabolism to the pathogenesis of 
Parkinson's disease, but the mechanisms are not resolved. Here, we generated a 
new Drosophila knock-in model of DNAJC6/Auxilin and find that the pathogenic 
mutation causes synaptic dysfunction, neurological defects and 
neurodegeneration, as well as specific lipid metabolism alterations. In these 
mutants, membrane lipids containing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
including phosphatidylinositol lipid species that are key for synaptic vesicle 
recycling and organelle function, are reduced. Overexpression of another protein 
mutated in Parkinson's disease, Synaptojanin-1, known to bind and metabolize 
specific phosphoinositides, rescues the DNAJC6/Auxilin lipid alterations, the 
neuronal function defects and neurodegeneration. Our work reveals a functional 
relation between two proteins mutated in Parkinsonism and implicates deregulated 
phosphoinositide metabolism in the maintenance of neuronal integrity and 
neuronal survival.
