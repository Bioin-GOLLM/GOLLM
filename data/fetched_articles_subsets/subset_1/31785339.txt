PURPOSE: Optimal radiation therapy (RT) target margins for diffuse intrinsic 
pontine glioma (DIPG) are unknown. We sought to define disease progression 
patterns in a contemporary cohort treated with conformal RT using different 
clinical target volume (CTV) margins.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We reviewed 105 patients with newly diagnosed DIPG 
treated with conformal conventionally fractionated RT at our institution from 
2006 to 2014. CTV margins were classified as standard (1 cm) for 60 patients and 
extended (2-3 cm) for 45 patients. Survival and cumulative incidence of 
progression in treatment groups were compared by log-rank and Gray's tests, 
respectively. Cox proportional hazard models identified predictors of survival.
RESULTS: For 97 patients evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging at 
progression, the cumulative incidences of isolated local, isolated distant, and 
synchronous disease progression at 1 year were 62.6%, 12.3%, and 7.2%, 
respectively, and did not differ significantly according to the CTV margin. 
Central dosimetric progression (Vprogression95% ≥95%) was observed in 80 of 81 
evaluable patients. Median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) 
were 7.6 months (95% confidence interval, 6.9-8.2) and 11.3 months (95% 
confidence interval, 10.0-12.8), respectively, and did not differ significantly 
according to margin status. DIPG survival prediction risk group (standard vs 
high, P = .02; intermediate vs high, P = .009) and development of distant 
metastasis (P = .003) were independent predictors of OS. For the 41 patients 
(39%) with a pathologic diagnosis, H3.3 K27M mutation was associated with 
shorter OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.41; P =.02), whereas H3.1 K27M and ACVR1 
mutations were associated with longer OS (HR, 3.56; P =.004 and HR, 2.58; P 
=.04, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: All patients who experienced local failure showed progression 
within the high-dose volume, and there was no apparent survival or tumor-control 
benefit to extending the CTV margins beyond 1 cm. Given the increasing use of 
reirradiation, standardizing the CTV margin to 1 cm may improve retreatment 
tolerance.
