Split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM), also known as ectrodactyly is a rare 
genetic disorder. It is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of limb 
malformations characterized by absence/hypoplasia and/or median cleft of hands 
and/or feet. To date, seven genes underlying SHFM have been identified. This 
study described four consanguineous families (A-D) segregating SHFM in an 
autosomal recessive manner. Linkage in the families was established to 
chromosome 12p11.1-q13.13 harboring WNT10B gene. Sequence analysis identified a 
novel homozygous nonsense variant (p.Gln154*) in exon 4 of the WNT10B gene in 
two families (A and B). In the other two families (C and D), a previously 
reported variant (c.300_306dupAGGGCGG; p.Leu103Argfs*53) was detected. This 
study further expands the spectrum of the sequence variants reported in the 
WNT10B gene, which result in the split hand/foot malformation.
