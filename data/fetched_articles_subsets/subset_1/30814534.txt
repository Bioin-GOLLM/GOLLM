We study electric and magnetic hotspots in the gap between hollow InSb 
microspheres forming dimers and trimers. The outer radius, core volume fraction, 
distance, and temperature of the microspheres can be chosen to achieve field 
enhancement at a certain frequency corresponding to the transition between 
energy levels of a molecule placed in the gap. For example, utilizing 80 μm 
radius spheres at a gap of 2 μm held at a temperature of 295 K, allow electric 
field intensity enhancements of 10-2880 and magnetic field intensity 
enhancements of 3-61 in the frequency window 0.35-1.50 THz. The core volume 
fraction and the ambient temperature affect the enhancements, particularly in 
the frequency window 1.5-2 THz. Electric and magnetic hotspots are promising for 
THz absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy.
