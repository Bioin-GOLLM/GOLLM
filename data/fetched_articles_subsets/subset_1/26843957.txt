Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by progressive neuronal loss and degeneration of upper motor 
neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN). The clinical presentations of ALS are 
heterogeneous and there is no single test or procedure to establish the 
diagnosis of ALS. Most cases are diagnosed based on symptoms, physical signs, 
progression, EMG, and tests to exclude the overlapping conditions. Familial ALS 
represents about 5 ~ 10 % of ALS cases, whereas the vast majority of patients 
are sporadic. To date, more than 20 causative genes have been identified in 
hereditary ALS. Detecting the pathogenic mutations or risk variants for each ALS 
individual is challenging. However, ALS patients carrying some specific 
mutations or variant may exhibit subtly distinct clinical features. Unraveling 
the respective genotype-phenotype correlation has important implications for the 
genetic explanations. In this review, we will delineate the clinical features of 
ALS, outline the major ALS-related genes, and summarize the possible 
genotype-phenotype correlations of ALS.
