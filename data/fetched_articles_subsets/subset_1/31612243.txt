Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic progressive, painful disease of synovial 
joints, characterized by cartilage degradation, subchondral bone remodeling, 
osteophyte formation, and synovitis. It is now widely appreciated that the 
innate immune system, and in particular Toll-like receptors (TLRs), contributes 
to pathological changes in OA joint tissues. Furthermore, it is now also 
increasingly recognized that TLR signaling plays a key role in initiating and 
maintaining pain. Here, we reviewed the literature of the past 5Â years with a 
focus on how TLRs may contribute to joint damage and pain in OA. We discuss 
biological effects of specific damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) 
which act as TLR ligands in vitro, including direct effects on pain-sensing 
neurons. We then discuss the phenotype of transgenic mice that target TLR 
pathways, and provide evidence for a complex balance between pro- and 
anti-inflammatory signaling pathways activated by OA DAMPs. Finally, we 
summarize clinical evidence implicating TLRs in OA pathogenesis, including 
polymorphisms and surrogate markers of disease activity. Our review of the 
literature led us to propose a model where multi-directional crosstalk between 
connective tissue cells (chondrocytes, fibroblasts), innate immune cells, and 
sensory neurons in the affected joint may promote OA pathology and pain.
