Glutathione transferases (GSTs) form a family of detoxication enzymes 
instrumental in the inactivation and elimination of electrophilic mutagenic and 
carcinogenic compounds. The Pi class GST P1-1 is present in most tissues and is 
commonly overexpressed in neoplastic cells. GST P1-1 in the dog, Canis lupus 
familiaris, has merits as a marker for tumors and as a target for 
enzyme-activated prodrugs. We produced the canine enzyme CluGST P1-1 by 
heterologous bacterial expression and verified its cross-reactivity with 
antihuman-GST P1-1 antibodies. The catalytic activity with alternative 
substrates of biological significance was determined, and the most active 
substrate found was benzyl isothiocyanate. Among established GST inhibitors, 
Cibacron Blue showed positive cooperativity with an IC50 value of 43 nM. Dog GST 
P1-1 catalyzes activation of the prodrug Telcyta, but the activity is 
significantly lower than that of the human homolog.
