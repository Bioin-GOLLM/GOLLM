Painful events establish opponent memories: cues that precede pain are 
remembered negatively, whereas cues that follow pain, thus coinciding with 
relief are recalled positively. How do individual reinforcement-signaling 
neurons contribute to this "timing-dependent valence-reversal?" We addressed 
this question using an optogenetic approach in the fruit fly. Two types of fly 
dopaminergic neuron, each comprising just one paired cell, indeed established 
learned avoidance of odors that preceded their photostimulation during training, 
and learned approach to odors that followed the photostimulation. This is in 
striking parallel to punishment versus relief memories reinforced by a real 
noxious event. For only one of these neuron types, both effects were strong 
enough for further analyses. Notably, interfering with dopamine biosynthesis in 
these neurons partially impaired the punishing effect, but not the relieving 
after-effect of their photostimulation. We discuss how this finding constraints 
existing computational models of punishment versus relief memories and introduce 
a new model, which also incorporates findings from mammals. Furthermore, whether 
using dopaminergic neuron photostimulation or a real noxious event, more 
prolonged punishment led to stronger relief. This parametric feature of relief 
may also apply to other animals and may explain particular aspects of related 
behavioral dysfunction in humans.
