INTRODUCTION: Catalase (CAT), an antioxidant enzyme, catalyzes conversion of 
hydrogen peroxide to water and molecular oxygen, protecting cells against 
oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible 
association between CAT C262T polymorphism in the promoter region of the CAT 
gene and leukemia risk and to determine the relationship between CAT genotypes 
and CAT enzyme activities.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Genotypes of 102 cases and 112 healthy controls' genotypes 
were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism methods. Catalase activity was measured with the method of Aebi.
RESULTS: The frequencies of the T allele among the cases and controls were 28.4% 
and 25.9%, respectively (p = 0.75). The frequencies of CC, CT, and TT among 
cases were 57.8%, 27.4%, and 14.7%, respectively, while in controls, the 
frequencies of CC, CT, and TT were 54.4%, 39.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, which 
were not significantly different. Although CAT enzyme activity was lower in 
leukemia patients with TT genotypes than in controls, this did not reach 
statistical significance (p = 0.37).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing that CAT C262T polymorphism is not 
a genetic predisposing factor for the risk of leukemia in the Turkish 
population. However, additional research is needed to confirm these findings.
