Mitotic progression is regulated by co-ordinated action of several proteins and 
is crucial for the maintenance of genomic stability. CHFR (Check point protein 
with FHA and RING domains) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a checkpoint protein 
that regulates entry into mitosis. But the molecular players involved in CHFR 
mediated mitotic checkpoint are not completely understood. In this study, we 
identified TOPK/PBK, a serine/threonine kinase and PTEN, a lipid phosphatase to 
play an important role in CHFR mediated mitotic transitions. We demonstrated 
that CHFR ubiquitinates and regulates TOPK levels, which is essential for its 
checkpoint function. Moreover, TOPK phosphorylates and inactivates PTEN, which 
in turn activates Akt that leads to proper G2/M progression. Collectively, our 
results reveal TOPK and PTEN as new players in CHFR mediated mitotic checkpoint.
