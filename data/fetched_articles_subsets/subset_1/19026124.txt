OBJECTIVE: Amyloid development in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients is 
associated with acute phase response and the acute phase reactant serum amyloid 
A which is induced by IL-1Beta. Its concentration can increase to more than 1000 
fold during inflammation. In view of the inflammatory nature of FMF disease we 
have investigated whether IL-1Beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist gene 
polymorphisms may be involved in amyloid development in FMF patients.
METHODS: Ninety-nine FMF patients without amyloidosis; 54 FMF patients with 
amyloidosis and 60 healthy controls samples were genotyped for IL-1Beta-511 
(C/T) and IL-1Beta+3953 (C/T) polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP and for IL-1Ra VNTR 
polymorphism using PCR.
RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequencies of IL-1Beta-511 (C/T), 
IL-1Beta+3953 (C/T) and IL-1Ra VNTR polymorphisms in FMF patients with and 
without amyloidosis were all compared with those in controls. There were no 
significant differences between FMF patients with and without amyloidosis and 
healthy control samples for these polymorphisms (all P-values are >0.05). These 
polymorphisms were not associated with M694V mutation in FMF patients with and 
without amyloidosis.
CONCLUSION: IL-1Beta-511 (C/T), IL-1Beta+3953 (C/T) and IL-1Ra VNTR 
polymorphisms are not associated with the development of amyloid in FMF 
patients.
