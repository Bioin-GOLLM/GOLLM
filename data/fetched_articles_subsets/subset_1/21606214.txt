BACKGROUND: Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is a chemoattractant of 
stem/progenitor cells, and several studies have shown that SDF-1 may improve 
ventricular function after infarction. SDF-1 is cleaved by proteases including 
matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4), which 
are activated in injured tissues.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the biodistribution and functional roles of 
SDF-1 in experimental ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. Radiolabeled SDF-1 
given by intracoronary injection was selectively concentrated in ischemic 
myocardium. The enhanced uptake of SDF-1 in ischemic myocardium was not mediated 
by its receptor, CXCR4. Mass spectrometry and Western analyses showed that SDF-1 
was cleaved by DPP-4 in plasma and myocardium, whereas a bioengineered 
MMP-2/DPP-4-resistant form of SDF-1, SSDF-1(S4V), was highly stable. A single 
dose of SSDF-1(S4V) exhibited greater potency for cardioprotection than 
wild-type SDF-1. SSDF-1(S4V) improved cardiac function in rats even after a 
3-hour ischemic period.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a single dose of protease-resistant 
SSDF-1(S4V) after myocardial infarction leads to dramatic improvement in 
angiogenesis and ventricular function even 3 hours after the onset of ischemia, 
revealing a simple, clinically feasible approach to prevention of heart failure.
