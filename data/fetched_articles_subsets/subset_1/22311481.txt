OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential mutation of PHOX2A (or ARIX) gene in a 
Chinese family affected with congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles tyep 2 
(CFEOM2).
METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from affected and unaffected members of the 
family. With an ABI PRSIM Linkage Mapping Set-MD10 kit, selected markers 
flanking the PHOX2A locus were used for linkage analysis. Exons of PHOX2 gene 
were amplified and sequenced. A total of 100 normal subjects were recruited as 
controls.
RESULTS: Genetic linkage was found at 11q13 between D11S4151 and D11S1320 and 
the PHOX2A gene. DNA sequencing has identified a heterozygous mutation in the 
exon 2 of the gene (227T to G, N76K). The same mutation was not found in the 
unaffected and 100 normal controls.
CONCLUSION: A mutation of the PHOX2A gene 227T to G is responsible for the onset 
of congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles type 2 in this Chinese family.
