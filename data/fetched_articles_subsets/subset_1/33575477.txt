This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism by which mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSCs) mediate lung cancer progression. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were 
isolated from transfected or untransfected MSCs, and were co-cultured with lung 
cancer cells with/without microRNA-130b-3p (miR-130b-3p) inhibitor, mimic, 
overexpression plasmids of FOXO3/NFE2L2, or shRNAs. CCK-8 assay, colony 
formation, transwell assay, and flow cytometry were carried out to determine the 
biological functioning of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, FOXO3, Keap1, NFE2L2, 
and TXNRD1 expression was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. A 
tumor xenograft mouse model was used to determine role of EVs-miR-130b-3p and 
its target FOXO3 in lung cancer progression in vivo. miR-130b-3p was highly 
expressed in lung cancer tissues and MSC-derived EVs. Moreover, the MSC-derived 
EVs transferred miR-130b-3p to lung cancer cells to promote cell proliferation, 
migration, and invasion while repress cell apoptosis. miR-130b-3p directly 
targeted FOXO3, and FOXO3 elevated Keap1 expression to downregulate NFE2L2, thus 
inhibiting TXNRD1. FOXO3 overexpression or silencing of NFE2L2 or TXNRD1 
diminished lung cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration but enhanced 
apoptosis. EV-delivered miR-130b-3p or FOXO3 silencing promoted lung cancer 
progression in vivo. In summary, MSC-derived EVs with upregulated miR-130b-3p 
suppressed FOXO3 to block the NFE2L2/TXNRD1 pathway, thus playing an oncogenic 
role in lung cancer progression.
