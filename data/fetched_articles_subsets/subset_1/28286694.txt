Extending the scope of biocatalysis to important non-natural reactions such as 
olefin cyclopropanation will open new opportunities for replacing multi-step 
chemical syntheses of pharmaceutical intermediates with efficient, clean, and 
highly selective enzyme-catalyzed processes. In this work, we engineered the 
truncated globin of Bacillus subtilis for the synthesis of a cyclopropane 
precursor to the antithrombotic agent ticagrelor. The engineered enzyme 
catalyzes the cyclopropanation of 3,4-difluorostyrene with ethyl diazoacetate on 
a preparative scale to give ethyl-(1R, 
2R)-2-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-cyclopropanecarboxylate in 79% yield, with very high 
diastereoselectivity (>99% dr) and enantioselectivity (98% ee), enabling a 
single-step biocatalytic route to this pharmaceutical intermediate.
