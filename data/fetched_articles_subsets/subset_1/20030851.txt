The last two decades have witnessed striking advances in our understanding of 
the biological factors underlying the development of Follicular lymphoma (FL). 
Development of newer treatment approaches have improved the outlook for many 
individuals with these disorders; however, with these advances come new 
questions. Given the long-term survival of patients with FL, drugs with 
favourable side-effect profile and minimal long-term risks are desired. FL is 
incurable with current treatment modalities. It often runs an indolent course 
with multiple relapses and progressively shorter intervals of remission. The 
identification of new targets and development of novel targeted therapies is 
imperative to exploit the biology of FL while inherently preventing relapse and 
prolonging survival. This review summarizes the growing body of knowledge 
regarding novel therapeutic targets, enabling the concept of individualized 
targeted therapy for the treatment of FL.
