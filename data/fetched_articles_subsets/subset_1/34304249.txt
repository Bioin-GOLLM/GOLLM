Targeting MAPK pathway using a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is an 
efficient strategy to treat melanoma harboring BRAF-mutation. The development of 
acquired resistance is inevitable due to the signaling pathway rewiring. 
Combining western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and reverse phase protein 
array (RPPA), we aim to understanding the role of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, 
a center node of intracellular signaling network, in mediating drug resistance 
of BRAF-mutant melanoma to the combination of BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) and MEK 
inhibitor (MEKi) therapy. The mTORC1 signaling pathway is initially suppressed 
by BRAFi and MEKi combination in melanoma but rebounds overtime after tumors 
acquire resistance to the combination therapy (CR) as assayed in cultured cells 
and PDX models. In vitro experiments showed that a subset of CR melanoma cells 
was sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition. The mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and 
NVP-BEZ235, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CR cell lines. As a 
proof-of-principle, we demonstrated that rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235 treatment 
reduced tumor growth in CR xenograft models. Mechanistically, AKT or ERK 
contributes to the activation of mTORC1 in CR cells, depending on PTEN status of 
these cells. Our study reveals that mTOR activation is essential for drug 
resistance of melanoma to MAPK inhibitors, and provides insight into the 
rewiring of the signaling networks in CR melanoma.
