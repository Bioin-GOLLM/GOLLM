The microtubule depolymerising kinesin-13, MCAK, is phosphorylated at residue 
T537 by Cdk1. This is the only known phosphorylation site within MCAK's motor 
domain. To understand the impact of phosphorylation by Cdk1 on microtubule 
depolymerisation activity, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of the 
phosphomimic mutant T537E. This mutant significantly impairs microtubule 
depolymerisation activity and when transfected into cells causes metaphase 
arrest and misaligned chromosomes. We show that the molecular mechanism 
underlying the reduced depolymerisation activity of this phosphomimic mutant is 
an inability to recognise the microtubule end. The microtubule-end residence 
time is reduced relative to wild-type MCAK, whereas the lattice residence time 
is unchanged by the phosphomimic mutation. Further, the microtubule-end specific 
stimulation of ADP dissociation, characteristic of MCAK, is abolished by this 
mutation. Our data shows that T537E is unable to distinguish between the 
microtubule end and the microtubule lattice.
