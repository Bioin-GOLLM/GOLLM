Nutrigenomics seeks to understand the interplay between an individual's genes 
and their diet. This approach can potentially be harnessed to reduce the 
incidence or symptoms of chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). It becomes desirable to interrogate the vast number of discrete compounds 
present in foods for their ability to influence the phenotype of a cell carrying 
a variant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Here we describe two cell-based 
assays that can now be used to test the ability of food components or extracts, 
to overcome the functional effects of certain variant SNPs that may be important 
in human IBD. The first monitors the signal transduction pathways of key pattern 
recognition receptors, in which SNPs associated with IBD have been identified, 
and tests for food components or extracts that can modulate these pathways for 
potential therapeutic benefit. The second models the NOD2 3020insC SNP, which is 
the most common and highest risk variant in Crohn's disease, and examines the 
ability of food components or extracts to restore the normal phenotype in the 
mutant cell line. Such screens provide a scientific basis for the rational 
choice of foods to be more rigorously investigated in animal models of IBD.
