Lentiviral-mediated beta-globin gene transfer successfully treated 
beta-thalassemic mice. Based on this result, clinical trials were initiated. To 
date, however, no study has investigated the efficacy of gene therapy in 
relation to the nature of the different beta-globin mutations found in patients. 
Most mutations can be classified as beta(0) or beta(+), based on the amount of 
beta-globin protein produced. Therefore, we propose that a screening in vitro is 
necessary to verify the efficacy of gene transfer prior to treatment of 
individual patients. We used a two-phase liquid culture system to expand and 
differentiate erythroid progenitor cells (ErPCs) transduced with lentiviral 
vectors. We propose the use of this system to test the efficiency of lentiviral 
vectors carrying the human beta-globin gene, to correct the phenotype of ErPCs 
from patients preparing for gene therapy. This new approach might have profound 
implications for designing gene therapy and for understanding the 
genotype/phenotype variability observed in Cooley's anemia patients.
