BACKGROUND: Epigenetic mechanisms are important in aging and may be involved in 
late-life changes in cognitive abilities. We conducted an epigenome-wide 
association study of leukocyte DNA methylation in relation to level and change 
in cognitive abilities, from midlife through late life in 535 Swedish twins.
RESULTS: Methylation levels were measured with the Infinium Human Methylation 
450 K or Infinium MethylationEPIC array, and all sites passing quality control 
on both arrays were selected for analysis (n = 250,816). Empirical Bayes 
estimates of individual intercept (age 65), linear, and quadratic change were 
obtained from latent growth curve models of cognitive traits and used as 
outcomes in linear regression models. Significant sites (p < 2.4 × 10-7) were 
followed up in between-within twin pair models adjusting for familial 
confounding and full-growth modeling. We identified six significant associations 
between DNA methylation and level of cognitive abilities at age 65: cg18064256 
(PPP1R13L) with processing speed and spatial ability; cg04549090 (NRXN3) with 
spatial ability; cg09988380 (POGZ), cg25651129 (-), and cg08011941 (ENTPD8) with 
working memory. The genes are involved in neuroinflammation, neuropsychiatric 
disorders, and ATP metabolism. Within-pair associations were approximately half 
that of between-pair associations across all sites. In full-growth curve models, 
associations between DNA methylation and cognitive level at age 65 were of small 
effect sizes, and associations between DNA methylation and longitudinal change 
in cognitive abilities of very small effect sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte DNA methylation was associated with level, but not change 
in cognitive abilities. The associations were substantially attenuated in 
within-pair analyses, indicating they are influenced in part by genetic factors.
