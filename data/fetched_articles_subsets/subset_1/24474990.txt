OBJECTIVE: Serotonin-1A receptors (5-HTR1A) is suggested to be involved in the 
etiology of several psychiatric disorders including panic disorder (PD). A few 
imaging studies have suggested the alterations of the cingulum bundle in PD. The 
objective of this study is to examine the structural changes of cingulum related 
to the 5-HTR1A polymorphism rs6295 in the patients with PD.
METHODS: Thirty-two right-handed patients with PD [11 men, 21 women; 40.34±13.17 
(mean±SD) age] who met the diagnostic criteria in Structured Clinical Interview 
for DSM-IV were examined by means of MRI at 3 Tesla. We divided the patients 
with PD into CC genotype group and non CC genotype group (GG/CG genotype group) 
of the 5-HTR1A rs6295 polymorphism to compare the cingulum white matter 
connectivity.
RESULTS: Tract-based spatial statistics showed significantly increased 
fractional anisotropy (FA) values in cingulate gyrus process of left cingulum in 
5-HTR1A CC genotype compared to GG/CG genotype in PD. Significant positive 
correlations were shown between the Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ) 
interoceptive fear subscale scores, the Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory-Revised 
fear of publicly observable anxiety reaction subscale scores and FA values of 
cingulate gyrus process of left cingulum in 5-HTR1A rs6295 GG/CG genotype group. 
In CC genotype group, APPQ total, APPQ agoraphobia subscale and APPQ social 
phobia subscale scores also showed significant positive correlations with FA 
values of hippocampal process of right cingulum.
CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests that 5-HTR1A polymorphism may be 
associated with the cingulum white matter connectivity in PD.
