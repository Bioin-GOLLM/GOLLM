As chronic inflammation is a hallmark of obesity, pathways that integrate 
nutrient- and pathogen sensing pathways are of great interest in understanding 
the mechanisms of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic 
metabolic pathologies. Here, we provide evidence that double-stranded 
RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) can respond to nutrient signals as well as 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and coordinate the activity of other critical 
inflammatory kinases such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to regulate 
insulin action and metabolism. PKR also directly targets and modifies insulin 
receptor substrate and hence integrates nutrients and insulin action with a 
defined pathogen response system. Dietary and genetic obesity features marked 
activation of PKR in adipose and liver tissues and absence of PKR alleviates 
metabolic deterioration due to nutrient or energy excess in mice. These findings 
demonstrate PKR as a critical component of an inflammatory complex that responds 
to nutrients and organelle dysfunction.
