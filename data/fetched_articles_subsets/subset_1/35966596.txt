RNA N6 -methyladenosine (m6A) modification and its regulators fine tune gene 
expression and contribute to tumorigenesis. This study aims to uncover the 
essential role and the underlying molecular mechanism(s) of the m6A reader 
YTHDC1 in promoting triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) metastasis.
METHODS: In vitro and in vivo models were employed to determine the pathological 
function of YTHDC1 in TNBC metastasis. To identify bona fide YTHDC1 target RNAs, 
we conducted RNA-seq, m6A-seq, and RIP-seq, followed by integrative data 
analysis and validation assays.
RESULTS: By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we found that 
elevated expression of YTHDC1 is positively correlated with poor prognosis in 
breast cancer patients. Using a mammary fat pad mouse model of TNBC, YTHDC1 
significantly promoted lung metastasis of TNBC cells. Through multiple 
transcriptome-wide sequencing and integrative data analysis, we revealed 
dysregulation of metastasis-related pathways following YTHDC1 depletion and 
identified SMAD3 as a bona fide YTHDC1 target RNA. Depletion of YTHDC1 caused 
nuclear retention of SMAD3 mRNA, leading to lower SMAD3 protein levels. Loss of 
YTHDC1 led to impaired TGF-β-induced gene expression, leading to inhibition of 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppressed TNBC cell migration and 
invasion. SMAD3 overexpression was able to restore the response to TGF-β in 
YTHDC1 depleted TNBC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the oncogenic role 
of YTHDC1 is mediated through its recognition of m6A as m6A-binding defective 
mutants of YTHDC1 were unable to rescue the impaired cell migration and invasion 
of YTHDC1 knockout TNBC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that YTHDC1 plays a critical oncogenic role in TNBC 
metastasis through promoting the nuclear export and expression of SMAD3 to 
augment the TGF-β signaling cascade. Overall, our study demonstrates that YTHDC1 
is vital for TNBC progression by enhancing TNBC cell survival and TGF-β-mediated 
EMT via SMAD3 to enable the formation of distant metastasis and highlights the 
therapeutic potential of targeting the YTHDC1/m6A/SMAD3 axis for TNBC treatment.
