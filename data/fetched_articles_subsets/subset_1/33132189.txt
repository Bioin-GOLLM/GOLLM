Dysfunction in mitochondrial dynamics is believed to contribute to a host of 
neurological disorders and has recently been implicated in cancer metastasis. 
The outer mitochondrial membrane adapter protein Miro functions in the 
regulation of mitochondrial mobility and degradation, however, the structural 
basis for its roles in mitochondrial regulation remain unknown. Here, we report 
a 1.7Å crystal structure of N-terminal GTPase domain (nGTPase) of human Miro1 
bound unexpectedly to GTP, thereby revealing a non-catalytic configuration of 
the putative GTPase active site. We identify two conserved surfaces of the 
nGTPase, the "SELFYY" and "ITIP" motifs, that are potentially positioned to 
mediate dimerization or interaction with binding partners. Additionally, we 
report small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data obtained from the intact soluble 
HsMiro1 and its paralog HsMiro2. Taken together, the data allow modeling of a 
crescent-shaped assembly of the soluble domain of HsMiro1/2. PDB RSEFERENCE:
