The association between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and breast cancer 
(BC) risk is complex. We aimed to examine this association in a systematic 
review of the literature. This review was done using the PubMed/Medline and Web 
of Science databases, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The Newcastle-Ottawa 
Scale was used for the assessment of bias and quality of studies. Only 
English-language articles published before 1 June 2021, were included. Fourteen 
studies were included in this systematic review. Among them, eight did not find 
statistically significant results. Three studies showed a statistically 
significant increased risk of BC after GDM, and they explained this potential 
increased risk by hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and low-grade inflammation. 
However, three studies showed a statistically significant decreased risk of BC 
after GDM, suggesting a possible protective effect of hormonal changes induced 
by GDM during pregnancy. These controversial results should be interpreted with 
caution due to both quantitative and qualitative methodological shortcomings. 
Further investigations are thus needed in order to gain a better understanding 
of the associations between GDM and BC, and their underlying mechanisms.
