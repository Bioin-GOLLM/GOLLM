Expansion of COVID-19 worldwide increases interest in unraveling genomic 
variations of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. Metadata of 408,493 SARS-CoV-2 genomes 
submitted to GISAID database were analyzed with respect to genomic clades and 
their geographic, age, and gender distributions. Of the currently known 
SARS-CoV-2 clades, clade GR was the most prevalent worldwide followed by GV then 
GH. Chronological analysis revealed expansion in SARS-CoV-2 clades carrying 
D614G mutations with the predominance of the newest clade, GV, in the last three 
months. D614G clades prevail in countries with more COVID-19 cases. Of them, the 
clades GH and GR were more frequently recovered from severe or deceased COVID-19 
cases. In contrast, G and GV clades showed a significantly higher prevalence 
among asymptomatic patients or those with mild disease. Metadata analysis showed 
higher (p < 0.05) prevalence of severe/deceased cases among males than females 
and predominance of GR clade in female patients. Furthermore, severe 
disease/death was more prevalent (p < 0.05) in elderly than in adults/children. 
Higher prevalence of the GV clade in children compared to other age groups was 
also evident. These findings uniquely provide a statistical evidence on the 
adaptation-driven evolution of SARS-CoV-2 leading to altered infectivity, 
virulence, and mortality.
