Autophagy is a genetically regulated process of adaptation to metabolic stress 
and was recently shown to be involved in the treatment response of chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML). However, in vivo data are limited and the molecular 
mechanism of autophagy regulators in the process of leukemogenesis is not 
completely understood. Here we show that Beclin-1 knockdown, but not Atg5 
deletion in a murine CML model leads to a reduced leukemic burden and results in 
a significantly prolonged median survival of targeted mice. Further analyses of 
murine cell lines and primary patient material indicate that active BCR-ABL 
directly interacts with BECLIN-1 and phosphorylates its tyrosine residues 233 
and 352, resulting in autophagy suppression. By using phosphorylation-deficient 
and phosphorylation-mimic mutants, we identify BCR-ABL induced BECLIN-1 
phosphorylation as a crucial mechanism for BECLIN-1 complex formation: 
interaction analyses exhibit diminished binding of the positive autophagy 
regulators UVRAG, VPS15, ATG14 and VPS34 and enhanced binding of the negative 
regulator Rubicon to BCR-ABL-phosphorylated BECLIN-1. Taken together, our 
findings show interaction of BCR-ABL and BECLIN-1 thereby highlighting the 
importance of BECLIN-1-mediated autophagy in BCR-ABL+ cells.
