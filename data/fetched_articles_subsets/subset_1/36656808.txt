BACKGROUND: Flavonoids are specialized metabolites with numerous biological 
functions in stress response and reproduction of plants. Flavones are one 
subgroup that is produced by the flavone synthase (FNS). Two distinct enzyme 
families evolved that can catalyze the biosynthesis of flavones. While the 
membrane-bound FNS II is widely distributed in seed plants, one lineage of 
soluble FNS I appeared to be unique to Apiaceae species.
RESULTS: We show through phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses that 
Apiaceae FNS I evolved through tandem gene duplication of flavanone 
3-hydroxylase (F3H) followed by neofunctionalization. Currently available 
datasets suggest that this event happened within the Apiaceae in a common 
ancestor of Daucus carota and Apium graveolens. The results also support 
previous findings that FNS I in the Apiaceae evolved independent of FNS I in 
other plant species.
CONCLUSION: We validated a long standing hypothesis about the evolution of 
Apiaceae FNS I and predicted the phylogenetic position of this event. Our 
results explain how an Apiaceae-specific FNS I lineage evolved and confirm 
independence from other FNS I lineages reported in non-Apiaceae species.
