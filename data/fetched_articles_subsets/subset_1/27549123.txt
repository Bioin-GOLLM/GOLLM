Immune recognition of tumor targets by specific cytotoxic lymphocytes is 
essential for the effective rejection of tumors. A phase I clinical trial of 
ipilimumab (an antibody that blocks CTLA-4 function) in combination with 
bevacizumab (an antibody that inhibits angiogenesis) in patients with metastatic 
melanoma found favorable clinical outcomes were associated with increased tumor 
endothelial activation and lymphocyte infiltration. To better understand the 
underlying mechanisms, we sought features and factors that changed as a function 
of treatment in patients. Ipilimumab plus bevacizumab (Ipi-Bev) increased tumor 
vascular expression of ICAM1 and VCAM1. Treatment also altered concentrations of 
many circulating cytokines and chemokines, including increases of CXCL10, IL1α, 
TNFα, CXCL1, IFNα2, and IL8, with decreases in VEGF-A in most patients. IL1α and 
TNFα induced expression of E-selectin, CXCL1, and VCAM1 on melanoma 
tumor-associated endothelial cells (TEC) in vitro and promoted adhesion of 
activated T cells onto TEC. VEGFA inhibited TNFα-induced expression of ICAM1 and 
VCAM1 and T-cell adhesion, which was blocked by bevacizumab. CXCL10 promoted 
T-cell migration across TEC in vitro, was frequently expressed by melanoma 
cells, and was upregulated in a subset of tumors in treated patients. Robust 
upregulation of CXCL10 in tumors was accompanied by increased T-cell 
infiltration. Ipi-Bev also augmented humoral immune responses recognizing 
targets in melanoma, tumor endothelial, and tumor mesenchymal stem cells. Our 
findings suggest that Ipi-Bev therapy augments immune recognition in the tumor 
microenvironment through enhancing lymphocyte infiltration and antibody 
responses. IL1α, TNFα, and CXCL10, together with VEGF neutralization, contribute 
to Ipi-Bev-induced melanoma immune recognition. Cancer Immunol Res; 4(10);
