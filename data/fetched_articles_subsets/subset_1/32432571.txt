Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative movement 
disorder, which is mainly due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Pyroptosis is 
a new programmed cell death characterized by NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 
3 (NLRP3)-dependent, IL-1β, IL-18 and Gasdermin D. Salidroside (Sal) has been 
reported to have neuro-protective effect. However, the roles of pyroptosis and 
Sal on anti-pyroptosis in PD have not been elucidated. In this study, we tested 
underlying mechanisms of pyroptosis in PD and neuro-protective effects of Sal. 
We established 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced 
C57BL/6J mice and C57BL/10ScNJ (TLR4-deficient mice) in vivo, MPTP-induced PC-12 
and LPS-induced BV2 in vitro. We found that Sal could ameliorate MPTP-induced PD 
symptoms and reduce the levels of IL-1β, IL-18 and Gasdermin D, which are main 
hallmarks of pyroptosis. Further study indicated that Sal alleviated PD through 
inhibiting NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis. In conclusion, pyroptosis plays a key 
role in PD and Sal protects dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting NLRP3-dependent 
pyroptosis through: (1) indirectly reducing the production of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β 
and pro-IL-18 by inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways, (2) directly 
suppressing pyroptosis through inhibiting TXNIP/NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling 
pathways. These results indicated that inhibiting pyroptosis or administration 
of Sal could be a novel therapeutic strategy for PD.
