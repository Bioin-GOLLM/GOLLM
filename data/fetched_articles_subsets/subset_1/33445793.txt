Poisoning by high concentrations of dioxin and its related compounds manifests 
variable toxic symptoms such as general malaise, chloracne, hyperpigmentation, 
sputum and cough, paresthesia or numbness of the extremities, 
hypertriglyceridemia, perinatal abnormalities, and elevated risks of 
cancer-related mortality. Such health hazards are observed in patients with 
Yusho (oil disease in Japanese) who had consumed rice bran oil highly 
contaminated with 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran, polychlorinated biphenyls, 
and polychlorinated quaterphenyls in 1968. The blood concentrations of these 
congeners in patients with Yusho remain extremely elevated 50 years after onset. 
Dioxins exert their toxicity via aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) through the 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this review article, we discuss 
the pathogenic implication of AHR in dioxin-induced health hazards. We also 
mention the potential therapeutic use of herbal drugs targeting AHR and ROS in 
patients with Yusho.
