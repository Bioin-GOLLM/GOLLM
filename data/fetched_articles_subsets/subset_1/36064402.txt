AIM: The aim of the present study is to compare the performance of 16S rRNA 
Nanopore sequencing and conventional culture in detecting infectious pathogens 
in patients with suspected meningitis in a resource-limited setting without 
extensive bioinformatics expertise.
METHODS: DNA was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 30 patients with 
suspected bacterial meningitis. The isolated DNA was subjected to 16S sequencing 
using MinION™. The data were analysed in real time via the EPI2ME cloud 
platform. The Nanopore sequencing was done in parallel to routine 
microbiological diagnostics.
RESULTS: Nanopore sequencing detected bacterial pathogens to species level in 13 
of 30 (43%) samples. CSF culture showed 40% (12/30) positivity. In 21 of 30 
patients (70%) with suspected bacterial meningitis, both methods yielded 
concordant results. About nine of 30 samples showed discordant results, of these 
five were false positive and four were false negative. In five of the culture 
negative results, nanopore sequencing was able to detect pathogen genome, due to 
the higher sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics. In two other samples, the 
CSF culture revealed Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which 
were not detected by Nanopore sequencing. Overall, using both the cultures and 
16S Nanopore sequencing, positivity rate increased from 40% (12/30) to 57% 
(17/30).
CONCLUSION: Next-generation sequencing could detect pathogens within six hours 
and could become an important tool for both pathogen screening and surveillance 
in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that do not have direct access to 
extensive bioinformatics expertise.
