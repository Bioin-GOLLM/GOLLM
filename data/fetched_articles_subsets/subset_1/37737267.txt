Gravity-dependent physical processes strongly affect the ability of elderly 
people to maintain musculoskeletal health by reducing muscle atrophy and 
increasing bone mineral density, thereby increasing quality of life. A need 
therefore exists to identify molecules in the musculoskeletal system that are 
responsive to gravitational loading and to establish an objective indicator for 
the maintenance of healthy musculoskeletal systems. Here, we performed an 
integrated assessment of the results of soleus muscle proteomic analyses in 
three model mouse experiments under different gravity environments 
(hypergravity, hindlimb unloading, and spaceflight). Myl6b, Gpd1, Fbp2, Pvalb, 
and Actn3 were shown to be gravity-responsive muscle proteins, and alterations 
in the levels of these proteins indicated changes in muscle fiber type to 
slow-twitch type due to gravity loading. In addition, immunoblotting and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that Pvalb levels in the sera of 
hindlimb-unloaded mice and osteoporosis patients were higher than in control 
subjects, suggesting that Pvalb levels might be useful to objectively evaluate 
soleus muscle atrophy and bone loss.
