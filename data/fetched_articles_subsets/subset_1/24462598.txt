Recent evidences indicated Nrf2 is more potent than Nrf1 in the activation of 
antioxidant genes. However, the roles of Nrf proteins in the regulation of 
copper-responsive transcription have not been well addressed. We took the 
toxicogenomic approach and the present network and Gene Ontology analyses 
results showed that Nrf1 and Nrf2 are distinctively involved in 
copper-responsive transcriptional regulation in HepG2 transcriptome. Cells 
deficient in either Nrf1 or Nrf2 were more susceptible to copper exposure than 
wild type cells. Nrf1 and Nrf2 null cells were transfected with the luciferase 
reporters containing either ARE(s) or a combination of ARE(s) and MREs, and then 
treated with copper. In Nrf2-null (Nrf2(-/-)) cells, copper did not activate 
transcription of reporter genes, whereas Nrf1 deficiency did not affect 
copper-inducible activation. Ectopic expression of Nrf2 restored 
copper-inducible transcription in Nrf2(-/-) cells. However, the changes in the 
intrinsic mRNA levels of MT-1 in Nrf null cells following copper treatment 
showed that Nrf1 and Nrf2 equally contributed to MT-1 activation after 4h, while 
Nrf1involved more than Nrf2 following 24h exposure. These results suggest that 
while Nrf2 is crucial for MRE/ARE-mediated transcription in response to copper, 
Nrf1 may activate MT-1 expression by a mechanism different from that Nrf2 
employs.
