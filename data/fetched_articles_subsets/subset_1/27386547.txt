Ca(2+)-sensing receptors (CaSRs) modulate calcium and magnesium homeostasis and 
many (patho)physiological processes by responding to extracellular stimuli, 
including divalent cations and amino acids. We report the first crystal 
structure of the extracellular domain (ECD) of human CaSR bound with Mg(2+) and 
a tryptophan derivative ligand at 2.1 Ã…. The structure reveals key determinants 
for cooperative activation by metal ions and aromatic amino acids. The 
unexpected tryptophan derivative was bound in the hinge region between two 
globular ECD subdomains, and represents a novel high-affinity co-agonist of 
CaSR. The dissection of structure-function relations by mutagenesis, 
biochemical, and functional studies provides insights into the molecular basis 
of human diseases arising from CaSR mutations. The data also provide a novel 
paradigm for understanding the mechanism of CaSR-mediated signaling that is 
likely shared by the other family C GPCR [G protein (heterotrimeric guanine 
nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor] members and can facilitate the 
development of novel CaSR-based therapeutics.
