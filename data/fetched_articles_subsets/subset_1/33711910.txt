INTRODUCTION: The past decades have witnessed a remarkable improvement in the 
health of patients with Gaucher disease, the inherited deficiency of the 
lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, resulting from the availability of enzyme 
replacement and substrate reduction therapies. Especially in pediatric 
populations, early diagnosis and initiation of treatment is essential to 
achieving optimal outcomes.
AREAS COVERED: The authors review the literature pertaining to the effectiveness 
of currently available therapies and describe new pharmacotherapies under 
development, especially for young patients.
EXPERT OPINION: For pediatric patients with non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease, 
there may be new therapeutic options on the horizon in the form of gene therapy 
or small molecule glucocerebrosidase chaperones. These have the potential to 
result in a cure for systemic disease manifestations and/or to reduce the cost 
and convenience of treatment. For children with neuronopathic Gaucher disease, 
the challenge of targeting therapy to the central nervous system is being 
explored through new modalities including brain-targeted gene therapy, in-utero 
therapy, brain-penetrant small molecule chaperones, and other methods that 
convey enzyme across the blood-brain barrier. Indeed, these are exciting times 
for both pediatric patients with Gaucher disease and those with other lysosomal 
storage disorders.
