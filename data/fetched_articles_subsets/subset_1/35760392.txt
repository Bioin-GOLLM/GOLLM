BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor level in the cerebrospinal fluid (c-BDNF) and 
mechanical allodynia in a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) rat model.
METHODS: After fixing the rat's skull on a stereotactic frame under general 
anesthesia, craniotomy was performed. After impact, 10 µl of drug was injected 
into the cisterna magna (group S: sham, group D: dexmedetomidine 5 μg/kg, group 
P: propofol 500 μg/kg, and group T: untreated TBI). The 50% mechanical 
withdrawal threshold (50% MWT) and c-BDNF level were measured on postoperative 
days (PODs) 1, 7, and 14.
RESULTS: The 50% MWT measured on PODs 1, 7, and 14 was lower and the c-BDNF 
level on POD 1 was higher in group T than in group S. In group D, the c-BDNF 
level on POD 1 was lower than that in group T and was comparable with that in 
group S during the whole study period. The 50% MWT of group D was higher than 
that of group T throughout the postoperative period. In group P, there were no 
significant differences in the 50% MWT during the entire postoperative period 
compared with group T; the c-BDNF level was higher than that in group T on POD 
1.
CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal administration of dexmedetomidine may attenuate 
TBI-induced mechanical allodynia for up to two weeks post-injury through 
immediate suppression of c-BDNF in mild TBI rats. The inhibition of c-BDNF 
expression in the acute phase reduced the occurrence of TBI-induced chronic 
neuropathic pain.
