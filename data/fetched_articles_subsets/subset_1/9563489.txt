Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is a newly recognized inherited 
disorder characterized by a predisposition to develop multiple bilateral 
papillary renal carcinomas. Individuals affected with HPRC have been shown to 
have germ-line mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET 
proto-oncogene. We identified a novel mutation in exon 16 of the MET gene in two 
large North American HPRC families. The H1112R MET mutation segregated with the 
disease, was not present in 320 normal chromosomes, and caused malignant 
transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. By examining individuals with the H1112R 
mutation, we determined the age-dependent penetrance of this mutation and 
identified additional nonrenal malignancies that occurred in mutation carriers. 
Affected members of the two families shared the same haplotype within and 
immediately distal to the MET gene, suggesting a founder effect. The 
identification of the H1112R mutation will facilitate predictive testing in HPRC 
and guide future studies of the MET gene in human neoplasia.
