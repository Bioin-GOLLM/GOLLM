BACKGROUND: The Warburg effect refers to glycolytic production of adenosine 
triphosphate under aerobic conditions, and is a universal property of most 
cancer cells. Chronic inflammation is a key factor promoting the Warburg effect. 
This study aimed to determine whether rosmarinic acid (RA) has an anti-Warburg 
effect in gastric carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism for the 
anti-Warburg effect was also investigated.
METHODS: An MTT assay was used to examine MKN45 cell growth in vitro. An 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect proinflammatory cytokines. 
Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate levels of microRNA 
expression in cells. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting 
assay. Mouse xenograft models were established using MKN45 cells to assess the 
anti-Warburg effect in gastric carcinoma in vivo.
RESULTS: RA suppressed glucose uptake and lactate production. It also inhibited 
expression of transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î±, which affects 
the glycolytic pathway. Inflammation promoted the Warburg effect in cancer 
cells. As expected, RA inhibited proinflammatory cytokines and microRNAs related 
to inflammation, suggesting that RA may suppress the Warburg effect via an 
inflammatory pathway, such as that involving interleukin (IL)-6/signal 
transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). miR-155 was found to be an 
important mediator in the relationship between inflammation and tumorigenesis. 
We further showed that miR-155 was the target gene regulating the Warburg effect 
via inactivation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Moreover, we found that RA 
suppressed the Warburg effect in vivo.
CONCLUSION: RA might potentially be a therapeutic agent for suppressing the 
Warburg effect in gastric carcinoma.
