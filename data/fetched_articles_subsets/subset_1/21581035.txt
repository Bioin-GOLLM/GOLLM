The title compound, C(15)H(14)N(2)O(4), has two crystallographically independent 
mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit. In both mol-ecules, the nitro and the two 
meth-oxy substituents are coplanar with the benzene rings to which they are 
attached. The benzene rings are nearly coplanar, with dihedral angles between 
the two benzene rings of 10.39 (8) and 5.95 (8)° in the two mol-ecules. The two 
independent mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit are rotated with respect to each 
other such that the dihedral angles between equivalent benzene rings are 
49.11 (8) and 63.93 (8)°. In the crystal structure, inter-molecular C-H⋯O 
hydrogen-bond contacts and a weak C-H⋯π inter-action are observed.
