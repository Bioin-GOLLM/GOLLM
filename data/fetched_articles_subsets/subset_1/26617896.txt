CCND1 plays a key role in cell cycle progression and may cause methotrexate 
(MTX) resistance, as well as its cytotoxicity. CCND1 870A variant allele is 
associated with altered transcripts of this gene. We hypothesized that this 
polymorphism may contribute to the elimination rate and hepatotoxicity of MTX in 
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We genotyped the CCND1 G870A 
polymorphism in 125 childhood ALL patients treated with HDMTX. We found no 
notable associations between G870A polymorphism and the risk of delayed MTX 
elimination. However, this polymorphism was significantly associated with an 
increased risk of MTX hepatotoxicity [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 4.44, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-14.63 for AG versus GG and adjusted OR = 6.39, 
95% CI = 1.82-22.43 for AA versus GG]. Our results indicated that the CCND1 
G870A polymorphism may be involved in the hepatotoxicity of MTX and act as a 
biological marker.
