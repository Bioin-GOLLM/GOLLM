With the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected individuals are 
now living longer and healthier lives. However, ART does not completely restore 
health and treated individuals are experiencing increased rates of 
noncommunicable diseases such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, type 2 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. While it 
is well known that persistent immune activation and inflammation contribute to 
the development of these comorbid diseases, the mechanisms underlying this 
chronic activation remain incompletely understood. In this review, we will 
discuss emerging evidence that suggests that alterations in cellular metabolism 
may play a central role in driving this immune dysfunction in HIV patients on 
ART.
