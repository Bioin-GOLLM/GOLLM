PURPOSE: The present study was intended to identify genetic causes of infertile 
patients with recurrent failure of in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic 
sperm injection (ICSI) attempts.
METHODS: Infertile patients with recurrent IVF/ICSI failure from Shanghai Ji Ai 
Genetics & IVF Institute and the Ninth Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao 
Tong University were recruited. Genomic DNA samples were extracted from their 
peripheral blood. Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger validation were performed to 
identify candidate variants.
RESULTS: We identified novel transducin-like enhancer of split 6 (TLE6) gene 
mutations in three patients with recurrent IVF/ICSI failure. One patient carried 
a homozygous missense mutation (c.1226G>A; p.Arg409Gln) with subsequent 
fertilization failure, while the other two patients carried either a homozygous 
missense mutation (c.1621G>A; p.Glu541Lys) or a compoundÂ heterozygous missense 
mutation (c.388G>A/c.1507G>A; p.Asp130Asn/p.Val503Ile) and had viable but 
low-quality embryos.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study expands the mutational and phenotypic spectrum of TLE6 
and suggests the important role of TLE6 during embryonic development. Our 
findings have implications for the genetic diagnosis of female infertility with 
recurrent IVF/ICSI failure.
