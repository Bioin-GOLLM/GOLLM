BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe, progressive, neurodevelopmental 
disorder predominantly observed in females that leads to intellectual 
disability. Mutations and gross rearrangements in MECP2 account for a large 
proportion of cases with RTT. A limited number of twin pairs with RTT have also 
been reported in literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: We investigated 13 year old, monozygotic twin females with 
RTT and some noticeable differences in development using a combinatorial 
approach of sequencing and Taqman assay. Monozygosity status of the twins was 
confirmed by informative microsatellite markers.
CONCLUSIONS: The twins shared a de novo deletion in exon 3 in the MBD domain of 
MECP2. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report of genetic 
analysis of a monozygotic twin pair.
