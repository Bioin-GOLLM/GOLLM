Dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI) type II (OMIM # 125490) is an inherited disorder 
affecting dentin. Defective dentin formation results in discolored teeth that 
are prone to attrition and fracture. To date, several mutations have been 
described in the dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) gene, causing DGI types II 
and III and dentin dysplasia type II. DSPP encodes two proteins: dentin 
sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP). Here, we describe a 
mutational analysis of DSPP in seven Finnish families with DGI type II. We 
report two mutations and five single nucleotide polymorphisms. In one family we 
found a mutation that has been described earlier in families with different 
ethnicity, while in six families we found a novel g.1194C>A (IVS2-3) 
transversion. Bioinformatic analysis of known DSPP mutations suggests that DGI 
type II is usually caused by aberration of normal splicing.
