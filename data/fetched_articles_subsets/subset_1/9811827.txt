The 2.15-A resolution cocrystal structure of EcoRV endonuclease mutant T93A 
complexed with DNA and Ca2+ ions reveals two divalent metals bound in one of the 
active sites. One of these metals is ligated through an inner-sphere water 
molecule to the phosphate group located 3' to the scissile phosphate. A second 
inner-sphere water on this metal is positioned approximately in-line for attack 
on the scissile phosphate. This structure corroborates the observation that the 
pro-SP phosphoryl oxygen on the adjacent 3' phosphate cannot be modified without 
severe loss of catalytic efficiency. The structural equivalence of key groups, 
conserved in the active sites of EcoRV, EcoRI, PvuII, and BamHI endonucleases, 
suggests that ligation of a catalytic divalent metal ion to this phosphate may 
occur in many type II restriction enzymes. Together with previous cocrystal 
structures, these data allow construction of a detailed model for the 
pretransition state configuration in EcoRV. This model features three divalent 
metal ions per active site and invokes assistance in the bond-making step by a 
conserved lysine, which stabilizes the attacking hydroxide ion nucleophile.
