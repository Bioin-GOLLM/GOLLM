A growing list of insulin gene mutations causing a new form of monogenic 
diabetes has drawn increasing attention over the past seven years. The mutations 
have been identified in the untranslated regions of the insulin gene as well as 
the coding sequence of preproinsulin including within the signal peptide, 
insulin B-chain, C-peptide, insulin A-chain, and the proteolytic cleavage sites 
both for signal peptidase and the prohormone convertases. These mutations affect 
a variety of different steps of insulin biosynthesis in pancreatic beta cells. 
Importantly, although many of these mutations cause proinsulin misfolding with 
early onset autosomal dominant diabetes, some of the mutant alleles appear to 
engage different cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie beta cell 
failure and diabetes. In this article, we review the most recent advances in the 
field and discuss challenges as well as potential strategies to prevent/delay 
the development and progression of autosomal dominant diabetes caused by 
INS-gene mutations. It is worth noting that although diabetes caused by INS gene 
mutations is rare, increasing evidence suggests that defects in the pathway of 
insulin biosynthesis may also be involved in the progression of more common 
types of diabetes. Collectively, the (pre)proinsulin mutants provide insightful 
molecular models to better understand the pathogenesis of all forms of diabetes 
in which preproinsulin processing defects, proinsulin misfolding, and ER stress 
are involved.
