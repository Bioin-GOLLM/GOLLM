BACKGROUND: This study investigated variation in NR1I2 and NR1I3 and its effect 
on plasma efavirenz levels in HIV/AIDS patients. Variability in plasma drug 
levels has largely led research on identifying causative variants in drug 
metabolising enzyme (DME) genes, with little focus on the nuclear receptor genes 
NR1I2 and NR1I3, coding for PXR and CAR, respectively, that are involved in 
regulating DMEs.
METHODS: 464 Bantu-speaking South Africans comprising of HIV/AIDS patients on 
efavirenz-based treatment (n=301) and 163 healthy subjects were genotyped for 6 
SNPs in NR1I2 and NR1I3. 32 of the 301 patients had their DNA binding domains 
(DBDs) in NR1I2 and NR1I3 sequenced.
RESULTS: Significantly decreased efavirenz plasma concentrations were observed 
in patients carrying the NR1I3 rs3003596C/C and T/C genotypes (P=0.015 and 
P=0.010, respectively). Sequencing resulted in the discovery of a further 13 
SNPs, 3 of which are novel variants in the DBD of NR1I2. There were significant 
differences in the distribution of NR1I2 and NR1I3 SNPs between South Africans 
when compared to Caucasian, Asian and Yoruba population groups.
CONCLUSION: For the realisation of personalised medicine, PXR and CAR genetic 
variation should be taken into consideration because of their involvement in the 
regulation of DMEs.
