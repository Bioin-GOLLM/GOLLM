Despite decades of intense study, the functions of sleep are still shrouded in 
mystery. The difficulty in understanding these functions can be at least partly 
attributed to the varied manifestations of sleep in different animals. Daily 
sleep duration can range from 4-20 hrs among mammals, and sleep can manifest 
throughout the brain, or it can alternate over time between cerebral 
hemispheres, depending on the species. Ecological factors are likely to have 
shaped these and other sleep behaviors during evolution by altering the 
properties of conserved arousal circuits in the brain. Nonetheless, core 
functions of sleep are likely to have arisen early and to have persisted to the 
present day in diverse organisms. This review will discuss the evolutionary 
forces that may be responsible for phylogenetic differences in sleep and the 
potential core functions that sleep fulfills.
