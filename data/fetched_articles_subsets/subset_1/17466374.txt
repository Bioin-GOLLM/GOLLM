Animal models of human diseases should meet three sets of criteria: construct 
validity, face validity, and predictive validity. To date, several putative 
animal models of bipolar disorder have been reported. They are classified into 
various categories: pharmacological models, nutritional models, environmental 
models, and genetic models. None of them, however, totally fulfills the three 
validity criteria, and thus may not be useful for drug development. Mounting 
evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction has a role in bipolar disorder. 
To test whether accumulation of mtDNA deletions in the brain can cause bipolar 
disorder, we generated transgenic mice with neuron-specific expression of mutant 
Polg (D181A). These mice showed altered diurnal activity rhythm and periodic 
activity change associated with the estrous cycle. These phenotypes were 
worsened by administration of a tricyclic antidepressant, but improved after 
lithium treatment. This mouse model of bipolar disorder potentially fulfills the 
three validity criteria, and therefore might be used for future drug development 
studies.
