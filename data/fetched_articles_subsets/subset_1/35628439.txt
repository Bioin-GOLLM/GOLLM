Bone substitutes with strong antibacterial properties and bone regeneration 
effects have an inherent potential in the treatment of severe bone tissue 
infections, such as osteomyelitis. In this study, vancomycin (Van) was loaded 
into zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) to prepare composite particles, 
which is abbreviated as V@Z. As a pH-responsive particle, ZIF-8 can be cleaved 
in the weak acid environment caused by bacterial infection to realize the 
effective release of drugs. Then, V@Z was loaded into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) 
fiber by electrospinning to prepare PVA/V@Z composite bone filler. The 
drug-loading rate of V@Z was about 6.735%. The membranes exhibited super 
hydrophilicity, water absorption and pH-controlled Van release behavior. The 
properties of anti E. coli and S. aureus were studied under the pH conditions of 
normal physiological tissues and infected tissues (pH 7.4 and pH 6.5, 
respectively). It was found that the material had good surface antibacterial 
adhesion and antibacterial property. The PVA/V@Z membrane had the more prominent 
bacteria-killing effect compared with the same amount of single antibacterial 
agent containing membrane such as ZIF-8 or Van loaded PVA, and the antibacterial 
rate was up to 99%. The electrospun membrane had good biocompatibility and can 
promote MC3T3-E1 cell spreading on it.
