Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Next-generation 
metabolomics is becoming a powerful emerging technology for studying the systems 
biology and chemistry of health and disease. This mini review summarized the 
main platforms of next-generation metabolomics and its main applications in lung 
cancer including early diagnosis, pathogenesis, classifications and precision 
medicine. The period covers between 2009 and August, 2017. The major issues and 
future directions of metabolomics in lung cancer research and clinical 
applications were also discussed.
