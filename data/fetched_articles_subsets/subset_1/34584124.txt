Highly selective and sensitive 2,7-naphthyridine based colorimetric and 
fluorescence "Turn Off" chemosensors (L1-L4) for detection of Ni2+ in aqueous 
media are reported. The receptors (L1-L4) showed a distinct color change from 
yellow to red by addition of Ni2+ with spectral changes in bands at 535-550 nm. 
The changes are reversible and pH independent. The detection limits for Ni2+ by 
(L1-L4) are in the range of 0.2-0.5 µM by UV-Visible data and 0.040-0.47 µM by 
fluorescence data, which is lower than the permissible value of Ni2+ (1.2 µM) in 
drinking water defined by EPA. The binding stoichiometries of L1-L4 for Ni2+ 
were found to be 2:1 through Job's plot and ESI-MS analysis. Moreover the 
receptors can be used to quantify Ni2+ in real water samples. Formation of test 
strips by the dip-stick method increases the practical applicability of the Ni2+ 
test for "in-the-field" measurements. DFT calculations and AIM analyses 
supported the experimentally determined 2:1 stoichiometries of complexation. 
TD-DFT calculations were performed which showed slightly decreased FMO energy 
gaps due to ligand-metal charge transfer (LMCT).
