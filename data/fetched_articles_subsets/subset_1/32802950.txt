OBJECTIVE: To define the phenotypic spectrum of isolated sulfite oxidase (ISOD) 
and molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD), aiming to promote timely diagnosis 
and assist in future clinical trial design.
METHODS: We analyzed clinical, radiographic, biochemical, and genetic data from 
146 patients reported in the literature.
RESULTS: We stratified patients into 2 phenotypic subgroups based on clinical 
and radiographic characteristics. In the first (Class I), patients presented 
early in life (age 1-50 days) with acute onset of neurologic symptoms and 
development of diffuse brain injury with cystic leukomalacia. Patients in the 
second subgroup (Class II) presented later in life (age 30 days-23 years) with 
prominent movement abnormalities and selective injury of the basal ganglia and 
cerebellum. A significant difference in survival estimates correlated with 
milder disease severity among Class II patients. Substantial overlap in 
sulfur-containing metabolite levels prevented discrimination of subgroups based 
on diagnostic biomarkers, but genotype-phenotype correlations suggested that 
residual SUOX activity may contribute to milder phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SUOX and MoCD gravitate toward 1 of 2 distinct 
clinicoradiographic profiles. Patient stratification may help promote accurate 
diagnosis, prognostication, and aid in the design of future clinical trials.
