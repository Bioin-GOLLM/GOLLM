Laboratory research and pharmacoepidemiology provide support for metformin as a 
potential antitumor agent. However, the lack of a clear understanding of the 
indications of metformin limits its efficacy. Here, we performed a genome-wide 
CRISPR knockout negative screen to identify potential targets that might 
synergize with metformin. Next-generation sequencing of pooled genomic DNAs 
isolated from surviving cells after 18 days of metformin treatment (T18) 
compared to those of the untreated cells at day 0 (T0) yielded candidate genes. 
Knockdown of a group of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), including CDK1, CDK4, 
and CDK6, confirmed the results of the screen. Combination treatment of the CDKs 
inhibitor abemaciclib with metformin profoundly inhibited tumor viability in 
vitro and in vivo. Although cell cycle parameters were not further altered under 
the combination treatment, investigation of the metabolome revealed significant 
changes in cell metabolism, especially with regard to fatty acid oxidation, the 
tricarboxylic acid cycle and aspartate metabolism. Such changes appeared to be 
mediated through inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Collectively, our study 
suggests that the combination of CDKs inhibitor with metformin could be 
recognized as a potential therapy in future clinical applications.
