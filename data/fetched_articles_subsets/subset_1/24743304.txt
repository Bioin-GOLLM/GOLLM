Lower respiratory tract bacterial infections are characterized by neutrophilic 
inflammation in the airways. The carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion 
molecule (CEACAM) 8 is expressed in and released by human granulocytes. Our 
study demonstrates that human granulocytes release CEACAM8 in response to 
bacterial DNA in a TLR9-dependent manner. Individuals with a high percentage of 
bronchial lavage fluid (BALF) granulocytes were more likely to have detectable 
levels of released CEACAM8 in the BALF than those with a normal granulocyte 
count. Soluble, recombinant CEACAM8-Fc binds to CEACAM1 expressed on human 
airway epithelium. Application of CEACAM8-Fc to CEACAM1-positive human pulmonary 
epithelial cells resulted in reduced TLR2-dependent inflammatory responses. 
These inhibitory effects were accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of the 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) of CEACAM1 and by 
recruitment of the phosphatase SHP-1, which could negatively regulate Toll-like 
receptor 2-dependent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase-Akt 
kinase pathway. Our results suggest a new mechanism by which granulocytes reduce 
pro-inflammatory immune responses in human airways via secretion of CEACAM8 in 
neutrophil-driven bacterial infections.
