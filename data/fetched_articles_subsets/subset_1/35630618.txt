In many regions of the world, Leishmaniasis is a cause of substantial mortality 
and ailment. Due to impediment in available treatment, development of novel and 
effective treatments is indispensable. Significance of autophagy has been 
accentuated in infectious disease as well as in Leishmaniasis, and it is having 
capability to be manifested as a therapeutic target. By evincing autophagy as a 
novel therapeutic regime, this study emphasized on the critical role of 
ATG4.1-ATG8 and ATG5-ATG12 complexes in Leishmania species. The objective here 
was to identify ATG8 as a potential therapeutic target in Leishmania. R71T, 
P56E, R18P are the significant mutations which shows detrimental effect on ATG8 
while Arg276, Arg73, Cys75 of ATG4.1 and Val88, Pro89, Glu116, Asn117, and 
Gly120 are interacting residues of ATG8. Along with this, we also bring into 
spotlight an enticing role of Thiabendazole derivatives that interferes with the 
survival mechanisms by targeting ATG8. Further, the study claims that 
thiabendazole can be a potential drug candidate to target autophagy process in 
the infectious disease Leishmaniasis.
