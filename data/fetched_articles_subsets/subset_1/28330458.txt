BACKGROUND: Exercise interventions to prevent dementia and delay cognitive 
decline have gained considerable attention in recent years. Human and animal 
studies have demonstrated that regular physical activity targets brain function 
by increasing cognitive reserve. There is also evidence of structural changes 
caused by exercise in preventing or delaying the genesis of neurodegeneration. 
Although initial studies indicate enhanced cognitive performance in patients 
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) following an exercise intervention, little 
is known about the effect of an extensive, controlled and regular exercise 
regimen on the neuropathology of patients with MCI. This study aims to determine 
the effects of an extensive exercise programme on the progression of MCI.
METHODS/DESIGN: This randomised controlled clinical intervention study will take 
place across three European sites. Seventy-five previously sedentary patients 
with a clinical diagnosis of MCI will be recruited at each site. Participants 
will be randomised to one of three groups. One group will receive a standardised 
1-year extensive aerobic exercise intervention (3 units of 45 min/week). The 
second group will complete stretching and toning (non-aerobic) exercise (3 units 
of 45 min/week) and the third group will act as the control group. Change in all 
outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), after six months (T1) and after 
12 months (T2). The primary outcome, cognitive performance, will be determined 
by a neuropsychological test battery (CogState battery, Trail Making Test and 
Verbal fluency). Secondary outcomes include Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA), cardiovascular fitness, physical activity, structural changes of the 
brain, quality of life measures and measures of frailty. Furthermore, outcome 
variables will be related to genetic variations on genes related to neurogenesis 
and epigenetic changes in these genes caused by the exercise intervention 
programme.
DISCUSSION: The results will add new insights into the prevailing notion that 
exercise may slow the rate of cognitive decline in MCI.
