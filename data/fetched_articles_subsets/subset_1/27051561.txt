One of the extreme challenges in biology is to ameliorate the understanding of 
the mechanisms which emphasize metabolic enzyme deficiency (MED) and how these 
pretend to have influence on human health. However, it has been manifested that 
MED could be either inherited as inborn error of metabolism (IEM) or acquired, 
which carries a high risk of interrupted biochemical reactions. Enzyme 
deficiency results in accumulation of toxic compounds that may disrupt normal 
organ functions and cause failure in producing crucial biological compounds and 
other intermediates. The MED related disorders cover widespread clinical 
presentations and can involve almost any organ system. To sum up the causal 
factors of almost all the MED-associated disorders, we decided to embark on a 
less traveled but nonetheless relevant direction, by focusing our attention on 
associated gene family products, regulation of their expression, genetic 
mutation, and mutation types. In addition, the review also outlines the clinical 
presentations as well as diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
