Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has a global reach with high prevalence in 
resource-limited areas like China and Africa. HBV patients in these areas have 
limited access to the currently used, costly HBV assays, which are performed in 
centralized clinical laboratories using single-plexed assays with bulky and 
expensive instruments. We aim to overcome these limitations by developing a 
simple and affordable HBV diagnostic platform to allow for timelier diagnosis 
and intervention of HBV infection. Using giant magnetoresistive (GMR) biosensor 
chips, we developed an automated and multiplexed quantitative platform for the 
measurement of a panel of HBV serology markers, including HBV "e" antigen 
(HBeAg), HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), and the antibody against HBsAg (anti-HBs). 
Our assay platform was able to detect each HBV marker with high specificity and 
sensitivity (with three orders of magnitude in dynamic range for each marker). 
Blinded analysis of HBV patient sera showed excellent correlation between our 
multiplexed quantitative HBsAg results and the qualitative results obtained 
using FDA-approved immunoassays, as well as those obtained using quantitative, 
single-plexed, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The portable, 
automated, multiplexed, quantitative HBV serology assay platform we designed 
shows great promise as a more accessible alternative for HBV screening, 
diagnosis, and treatment monitoring.
