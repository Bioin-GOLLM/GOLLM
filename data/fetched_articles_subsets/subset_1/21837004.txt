The title compound, C(15)H(15)NO(3), was prepared by stirring benzoyl chloride 
with 3,5-dimeth-oxy-aniline in dioxane at ambient temperature. The 
dimeth-oxy-phen-yl-amide segment of the mol-ecule is almost planar, with a 
C-N-C=O torsion angle of -4.1 (4)°. The two benzene rings are inclined at an 
angle of 76.66 (13)°. In the crystal, inter-molecular N-H⋯O inter-actions 
generate centrosymmetric dimers..
