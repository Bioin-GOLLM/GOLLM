The intricate formation of the cerebral cortex requires a well-coordinated 
series of events, which are regulated at the level of cell-autonomous and 
non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Whereas cell-autonomous mechanisms that regulate 
cortical development are well-studied, the non-cell autonomous mechanisms remain 
poorly understood. A non-biased screen allowed us to identify Autotaxin (ATX) as 
a non-cell autonomous regulator of neural stem cells. ATX (also known as ENPP2) 
is best known to catalyze lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) production. Our results 
demonstrate that ATX affects the localization and adhesion of neuronal 
progenitors in a cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous manner, and strikingly, 
this activity is independent from its catalytic activity in producing LPA.
