The antiangiogenic factor METH-2 (ADAMTS-8) was identified in a previous 
dual-channel cDNA microarray analysis to be at least two-fold under-represented 
in 85% (28 out of 33) of primary non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). This 
observation has been validated in an independent series of NSCLCs and adjacent 
normal tissues by comparative multiplex RT-PCR, and METH-2 mRNA expression was 
dramatically reduced in all 23 tumour samples analysed. Immunohistochemical 
analysis of the same sample set demonstrated that METH-2 was strongly expressed 
in 14 out of 19 normal epithelial sites examined but only one out of 20 NSCLCs. 
DNA methylation analysis of the proximal promoter region of this gene revealed 
abnormal hypermethylation in 67% of the adenocarcinomas and 50% of squamous cell 
carcinomas, indicating that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in silencing this 
gene in NSCLC. No homozygous deletions of METH-2 were found in lung cancer cell 
lines. Allelic imbalance in METH-2 was assessed by an intronic single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) assay and observed in 44% of informative primary samples. In 
conclusion, the downregulation of METH-2 expression in primary NSCLC, often 
associated with promoter hypermethylation, is a frequent event, which may be 
related to the development of the disease.
