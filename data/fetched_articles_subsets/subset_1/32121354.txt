Ultraviolet B (UV-B, 280-320 nm) radiation causes complex molecular reactions in 
cells, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. This study 
designed a mixture consisting of quercetin, luteolin and lycopene and used 
Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to study the resistance of these natural 
chemicals to UV-B. Specifically, we have confirmed that quercetin and its 
mixture can increase the resistance of Caenorhabditis elegans to UV-B through 
lifespan test, reactive oxygen species level assay, germ cell apoptosis test, 
embryonic lethal test and RT-qPCR experiments. The results show that quercetin 
and its mixture prolonged the lifespan of UV-B-irradiated Caenorhabditis elegans 
and reduced abnormal levels of reactive oxygen species, embryo death, and 
apoptosis induced by UV-B. The protective effect of quercetin and its mixture 
may be attributed to its down-regulation of HUS-1, CEP-1, EGL-1 and CED-13. 
Therefore, the results of this research could help the development of UV-B 
radiation protection agents.
