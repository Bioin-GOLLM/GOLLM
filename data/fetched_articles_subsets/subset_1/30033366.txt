Seminal yeast studies have established the value of comprehensively mapping 
genetic interactions (GIs) for inferring gene function. Efforts in human cells 
using focused gene sets underscore the utility of this approach, but the 
feasibility of generating large-scale, diverse human GI maps remains unresolved. 
We developed a CRISPR interference platform for large-scale quantitative mapping 
of human GIs. We systematically perturbed 222,784 gene pairs in two cancer cell 
lines. The resultant maps cluster functionally related genes, assigning function 
to poorly characterized genes, including TMEM261, a new electron transport chain 
component. Individual GIs pinpoint unexpected relationships between pathways, 
exemplified by a specific cholesterol biosynthesis intermediate whose 
accumulation induces deoxynucleotide depletion, causing replicative DNA damage 
and a synthetic-lethal interaction with the ATR/9-1-1 DNA repair pathway. Our 
map provides a broad resource, establishes GI maps as a high-resolution tool for 
dissecting gene function, and serves as a blueprint for mapping the genetic 
landscape of human cells.
