PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease caused by complex 
interplay among the diet, the environment, and genetics involving numerous 
molecules and pathological pathways. This study aimed to determine whether 
methyl donor nutrients are associated with CRC and how these associations are 
altered by DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes.
METHODS: In total, 626 cases and 838 age- and sex-matched controls were 
recruited for this case-control study. A validated food frequency questionnaire 
was used to assess seven methyl donor nutrients (vitamin B2, niacin, B6, folate, 
B12, methionine, and choline). MMR polymorphisms were genotyped using an 
Illumina MEGA-Expanded Array. For the 626 patients, the microsatellite 
instability status and immunohistochemical expression of MMR proteins were 
analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Among the methyl donor nutrients, B2, niacin, B6, folate, and 
methionine were inversely associated with CRC risk, while a high intake of 
choline increased CRC. Regarding MMR genes, three hMSH3 polymorphisms (rs32952 
A > C, rs41097 A > G, and rs245404 C > G) reduced CRC risk. Regarding gene-diet 
interactions, a stronger interaction effect was observed in G allele carriers of 
hMSH3 rs41097 with high niacin intake than in AA carriers with low niacin intake 
(OR, 95% CI = 0.49, 0.33-0.72, P for interaction = 0.02) in subgroups of 
patients with distal colon cancer (P for interaction = 0.008) and MMR 
proficiency with microsatellite stability (P for interaction = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: Methyl donor nutrients may affect CRC risk leading to a balance in 
the MMR machinery.
