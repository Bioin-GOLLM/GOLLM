Existing methods for identifying structural variants (SVs) from short read 
datasets are inaccurate. This complicates disease-gene identification and 
efforts to understand the consequences of genetic variation. In response, we 
have created Wham (Whole-genome Alignment Metrics) to provide a single, 
integrated framework for both structural variant calling and association 
testing, thereby bypassing many of the difficulties that currently frustrate 
attempts to employ SVs in association testing. Here we describe Wham, benchmark 
it against three other widely used SV identification tools-Lumpy, Delly and 
SoftSearch-and demonstrate Wham's ability to identify and associate SVs with 
phenotypes using data from humans, domestic pigeons, and vaccinia virus. Wham
