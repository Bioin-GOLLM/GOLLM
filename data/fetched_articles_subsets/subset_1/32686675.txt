Endosomes are compositionally dynamic organelles that regulate signaling, 
nutrient status and organelle quality by specifying whether material entering 
the cells will be shuttled back to the cell surface or degraded by the lysosome. 
Recently, membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
and endosomes have emerged as important players in endosomal protein sorting, 
dynamics and motility. Here, we show that PDZD8, a Synaptotagmin-like 
Mitochondrial lipid-binding Proteins (SMP) domain-containing ER transmembrane 
protein, utilizes distinct domains to interact with Rab7-GTP and the ER 
transmembrane protein Protrudin and together these components localize to an 
ER-late endosome MCS. At these ER-late endosome MCSs, mitochondria are also 
recruited to form a three-way contact. Thus, our data indicate that PDZD8 is a 
shared component of two distinct MCSs and suggest a role for SMP-mediated lipid 
transport in the regulation of endosome function.
