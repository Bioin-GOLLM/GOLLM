Methanol is abundant in the phyllosphere, the surface of the above-ground parts 
of plants, and its concentration oscillates diurnally. The phyllosphere is one 
of the major habitats for a group of microorganisms, the so-called 
methylotrophs, that utilize one-carbon (C1) compounds, such as methanol and 
methane, as their sole source of carbon and energy. Among phyllospheric 
microorganisms, methanol-utilizing methylotrophic bacteria, known as 
pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophs (PPFMs), are the dominant colonizers of 
the phyllosphere, and some of them have recently been shown to have the ability 
to promote plant growth and increase crop yield. In addition to PPFMs, 
methanol-utilizing yeasts can proliferate and survive in the phyllosphere by 
using unique molecular and cellular mechanisms to adapt to the stressful 
phyllosphere environment. This review describes our current understanding of the 
physiology of methylotrophic bacteria and yeasts living in the phyllosphere 
where they are exposed to diurnal cycles of environmental conditions.
