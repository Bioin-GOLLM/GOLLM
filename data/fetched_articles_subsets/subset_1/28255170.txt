Telomerase activation and telomere maintenance are critical for cellular 
immortalization and transformation. PIN2/TERF1-interacting telomerase inhibitor 
1 (PinX1) is a telomerase regulator and the aberrant expression of PinX1 causes 
telomere shortening. Identifying PinX1-interacting proteins is important for 
understanding telomere maintenance. We found that PinX1 directly interacts with 
nucleophosmin (NPM), a protein that has been shown to positively correlate with 
telomerase activity. We further showed that PinX1 acts as a linker in the 
association between NPM and hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase. 
Additionally, the recruitment of NPM by PinX1 to the telomerase complex could 
partially attenuate the PinX1-mediated inhibition on telomerase activity. Taken 
together, our data reveal a novel mechanism that regulates telomerase activation 
through the interaction between NPM, PinX1 and the telomerase complex.
