BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies identified the FTO (fat mass and 
obesity gene) gene as an important determinant of body weight. More recently, 
the FTO gene was reported to be associated with other outcomes, including major 
risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated the role of this 
gene in the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) caused by CKD.
METHODS: We conducted two large population-based case-control studies of ESRD. 
Study 1 compared 984 haemodialysed patients with ESRD with 2501 participants in 
the Czech post-MONICA study; Study 2 compared 1188 patients included in a kidney 
transplantation programme for ESRD with 6681 participants in the Czech HAPIEE 
study. The frequencies of the FTO rs17817449 single nucleotide polymorphism 
genotype were compared between cases and controls.
RESULTS: The FTO rs17817449 genotype was significantly associated with CKD in 
both studies (P-values 0.00004 and 0.006, respectively). In the pooled data, the 
odds ratios of CKD for GG and GT, versus TT genotype, were 1.37 (95% confidence 
interval 1.20-1.56) and 1.17 (1.05-1.31), respectively (P for trend <0.0001). 
Among haemodialysed and kidney transplant patients, the onset of ESRD in GG 
homozygotes was 3.3 (P = 0.012) and 2.5 (P = 0.032) years, respectively, earlier 
than in TT homozygotes.
CONCLUSIONS: These two large independent case-control studies in the general 
population found robust associations between the FTO rs17817449 polymorphism and 
the ESRD. The results suggest that the morbidities associated with the FTO gene 
include CKD.
