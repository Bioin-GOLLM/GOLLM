Acute lymphoblastic leukemia remains a leading cause of cancer-related death in 
children. Furthermore, subtypes such as Ph-like ALL remain at high-risk of 
relapse, and treatment resistance remains a significant clinical issue. The 
patient-derived Ph-like ALL RANBP2-ABL1 fusion gene was transduced into Ba/F3 
cells and allowed to become resistant to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
imatinib or dasatinib, followed by secondary resistance to ponatinib. 
RANBP2-ABL1 Ba/F3 cells developed the clinically relevant ABL1 p.T315I mutation 
and upon secondary resistance to ponatinib, developed compound mutations, 
including a novel ABL1 p.L302H mutation. Significantly, compound mutations were 
targetable with a combination of asciminib and ponatinib. In-vitro modeling of 
Ph-like ALL RANBP2-ABL1 has identified kinase domain mutations in response to 
TKI treatment, that may have important clinical ramifications. Early detection 
of mutations is paramount to guide treatment strategies and improve survival in 
this high-risk group of patients.
