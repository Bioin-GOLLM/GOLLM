Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM) has been used in oriental medicine for its 
neuroprotective effects against cardiovascular diseases and ischemic stroke. In 
this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanism underlying the effects of 
SM on stroke using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse 
model. Our results showed that SM administration significantly attenuated acute 
brain injury, including brain infarction and neurological deficits, 3 days after 
tMCAO. This was confirmed by our magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, which 
revealed a reduction in brain infarction with SM administration, as well as our 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study, which demonstrated the restoration 
of brain metabolites, including taurine, total creatine, and glutamate. The 
neuroprotective effects of SM were associated with the reduction in gliosis and 
upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), along with the upregulation of phosphorylated STAT3 
in post-ischemic brains. SM also reduced the levels of 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) 
and malondialdehyde (MDA), which are markers of lipid peroxidation, induced by 
oxidative stress upregulation in the penumbra of the tMCAO mouse brain. SM 
administration attenuated ischemic neuronal injury by inhibiting ferroptosis. 
Additionally, post-ischemic brain synaptic loss and neuronal loss were 
alleviated by SM administration, as demonstrated by Western blot and Nissl 
staining. Moreover, daily administration of SM for 28 days after tMCAO 
significantly reduced neurological deficits and improved survival rates in tMCAO 
mice. SM administration also resulted in improvement in post-stroke cognitive 
impairment, as measured by the novel object recognition and passive avoidance 
tests in tMCAO mice. Our findings suggest that SM provides neuroprotection 
against ischemic stroke and has potential as a therapeutic agent.
