The global response to the most recent EBOV outbreak has led to increased 
generation and availability of data, which can be globally analyzed to increase 
our understanding of immune responses to EBOV. We analyzed the published 
antibody epitope data to identify regions immunogenic for humans on the main GP 
antigenic target and determine sequence variance/nonsynonymous mutations between 
historical isolates and variants from the 2013-2016 outbreak. Approximately half 
of the GP sequence has been reported as targeted by antibody responses. Our 
results show an enrichment of nonsynonymous mutations (NSMs) within epitopic 
regions on GP (70%, p = 0.0133). Mapping NSMs to human epitope reactivity may be 
useful for future therapeutic and prophylaxis development as well as for our 
general understanding of immunity against EBOV.
