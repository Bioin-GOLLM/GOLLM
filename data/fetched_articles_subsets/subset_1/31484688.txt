Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) read the genetic code, translating nucleic acid sequence 
into protein. For tRNASer the anticodon does not specify its aminoacylation. For 
this reason, mutations in the tRNASer anticodon can result in amino acid 
substitutions, a process called mistranslation. Previously, we found that 
tRNASer with a proline anticodon was lethal to cells. However, by incorporating 
secondary mutations into the tRNA, mistranslation was dampened to a nonlethal 
level. The goal of this work was to identify second-site substitutions in 
tRNASer that modulate mistranslation to different levels. Targeted changes to 
putative identity elements led to total loss of tRNA function or significantly 
impaired cell growth. However, through genetic selection, we identified 22 
substitutions that allow nontoxic mistranslation. These secondary mutations are 
primarily in single-stranded regions or substitute G:U base pairs for 
Watson-Crick pairs. Many of the variants are more toxic at low temperature and 
upon impairing the rapid tRNA decay pathway. We suggest that the majority of the 
secondary mutations affect the stability of the tRNA in cells. The temperature 
sensitivity of the tRNAs allows conditional mistranslation. Proteomic analysis 
demonstrated that tRNASer variants mistranslate to different extents with 
diminished growth correlating with increased mistranslation. When combined with 
a secondary mutation, other anticodon substitutions allow serine mistranslation 
at additional nonserine codons. These mistranslating tRNAs have applications in 
synthetic biology, by creating "statistical proteins," which may display a wider 
range of activities or substrate specificities than the homogenous form.
