Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is common among older adults. Amidst all 
causes, Fabry disease (FD) should be considered when LVH occurs with family 
history, specific clinical manifestations, or cardiac alert signs. Here, we 
report a case of a 76-year-old male who presented late onset concentric LVH with 
symptomatic high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block. After dual-chamber pacemaker 
implantation, interrogation revealed frequent right ventricular (RV) pacing with 
a wide QRS duration. The patient developed heart failure symptoms with rapid 
deterioration of LV systolic function. Pacing-induced cardiomyopathy (PICM) was 
suspected, and the pacemaker was upgraded to biventricular pacing. Further FD 
surveys were performed, including biochemical examinations, cardiac biopsies, 
and genetic sequencing, and the patient was ultimately diagnosed with a cardiac 
variant of FD. Particularly, we strongly suggest that physiologic pacing should 
be initially considered for patients with FD who have symptomatic high-grade AV 
block, rather than traditional RV pacing to prevent PICM.
