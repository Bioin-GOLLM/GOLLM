RAF and MEK inhibitors are effective in BRAF-mutant melanoma but not in 
BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. To gain additional insights into this difference, 
we performed a genome-scale pooled shRNA enhancer screen in a BRAF-mutant, RAF 
inhibitor-resistant colorectal cancer cell line exposed to the selective RAF 
inhibitor PLX4720. We identified multiple genes along the receptor tyrosine 
kinase (RTK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling axis that, when 
suppressed, either genetically or pharmacologically, sensitized cells to the 
selective RAF inhibitor through sustained inhibition of MAPK signaling. 
Strikingly, CRAF was a key mediator of resistance that could be overcome by the 
use of pan-RAF inhibitors in combination with a MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, the 
combination of pan-RAF and MEK inhibitors displayed strong synergy in melanoma 
and colorectal cancer cell lines with RAS-activating events such as RTK 
activation, KRAS mutation, or NF1 loss-of-function mutations. Combinations of 
selective RAF inhibitors, such as PLX4720 or dabrafenib, with MEK inhibitors did 
not incur such profound synergy, suggesting that inhibition of CRAF by pan-RAF 
inhibitors plays a key role in determining cellular response. Importantly, in 
contrast to the modest activity seen with single-agent treatment, dual pan-RAF 
and MEK inhibition results in the induction of apoptosis, greatly enhancing 
efficacy. Notably, combined pan-RAF and MEK inhibition can overcome intrinsic 
and acquired resistance to single-agent RAF/MEK inhibition, supporting dual 
pan-RAF and MEK inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for BRAF- and 
KRAS-mutant cancers.
