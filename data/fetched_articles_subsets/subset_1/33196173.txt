Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are fundamental for cellular 
processes. Small-molecule PPI enhancers have been shown to be powerful tools to 
fundamentally study PPIs and as starting points for potential new therapeutics. 
Yet, systematic approaches for their discovery are not widely available, and the 
design prerequisites of "molecular glues" are poorly understood. Covalent 
fragment-based screening can identify chemical starting points for these 
enhancers at specific sites in PPI interfaces. We recently reported a mass 
spectrometry-based disulfide-trapping (tethering) approach for a cysteine 
residue in the hub protein 14-3-3, an important regulator of phosphorylated 
client proteins. Here, we invert the strategy and report the development of a 
functional read-out for systematic identification of PPI enhancers based on 
fluorescence anisotropy (FA-tethering) with the reactive handle now on a 
client-derived peptide. Using the DNA-binding domain of the nuclear receptor 
Estrogen Related Receptor gamma (ERRγ), we target a native cysteine positioned 
at the 14-3-3 PPI interface and identify several fragments that form a disulfide 
bond to ERRγ and stabilize the complex up to 5-fold. Crystallography indicates 
that fragments bind in a pocket comprised of 14-3-3 and the ERRγ phosphopeptide. 
FA-tethering presents a streamlined methodology to discover molecular glues for 
protein complexes.
