Aberrant angiogenesis lies at the heart of a wide range of ocular pathologies 
such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, wet age-related macular degeneration 
and retinopathy of prematurity. This study explores the anti-angiogenic activity 
of a novel small molecule investigative compound capable of inhibiting 
profilin1-actin interaction recently identified by our group. We demonstrate 
that our compound is capable of inhibiting migration, proliferation and 
angiogenic activity of microvascular endothelial cells in vitro as well as 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV) ex vivo. In mouse model of laser-injury 
induced CNV, intravitreal administration of this compound diminishes sub-retinal 
neovascularization. Finally, our preliminary structure-activity relationship 
study (SAR) demonstrates that this small molecule compound is amenable to 
improvement in biological activity through structural modifications.
