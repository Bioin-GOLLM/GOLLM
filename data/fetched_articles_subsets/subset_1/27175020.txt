Targeted gene mutation in the mouse is a primary strategy to understand gene 
function and relation to phenotype. The Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) had an 
initial goal to develop a public resource of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell 
clones that carry null mutations in all genes. Indeed, many useful novel mouse 
models have been generated from publically accessible targeted mouse ES cell 
lines. However, there are limitations, including incorrect targeting or cassette 
structure, and difficulties with germline transmission of the allele from 
chimeric mice. In our experience, using a small sample of targeted ES cell 
clones, we were successful ∼50% of the time in generating germline transmission 
of a correctly targeted allele. With the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 as a mouse genome 
modification tool, we assessed the efficiency of creating a conditional targeted 
allele in one gene, dedicator of cytokinesis 7 (Dock7), for which we were 
unsuccessful in generating a null allele using a KOMP targeted ES cell clone. 
The strategy was to insert loxP sites to flank either exons 3 and 4, or exons 3 
through 7. By coinjecting Cas9 mRNA, validated sgRNAs, and oligonucleotide 
donors into fertilized eggs from C57BL/6J mice, we obtained a variety of 
alleles, including mice homozygous for the null alleles mediated by 
nonhomologous end joining, alleles with one of the two desired loxP sites, and 
correctly targeted alleles with both loxP sites. We also found frequent 
mutations in the inserted loxP sequence, which is partly attributable to the 
heterogeneity in the original oligonucleotide preparation.
