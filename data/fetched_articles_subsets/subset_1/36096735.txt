BACKGROUND: Understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms that drive 
phenotypic variations is essential for enhancing the efficacy of crop 
improvement. Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.), which is grown extensively 
worldwide, is an important economic tree fruit due to its horticultural, 
medicinal, and material value. The quality of the walnut fruit is related to the 
selection of traits such as thinner shells, larger filling rates, and better 
taste, which is very important for breeding in China. The complex quantitative 
fruit-related traits are influenced by a variety of physiological and 
environmental factors, which can vary widely between walnut genotypes.
RESULTS: For this study, a set of 101 Persian walnut accessions were 
re-sequenced, which generated a total of 906.2 Gb of Illumina sequence data with 
an average read depth of 13.8× for each accession. We performed the genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) using 10.9 Mb of high-quality single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) and 10 agronomic traits to explore the underlying genetic 
basis of the walnut fruit. Several candidate genes are proposed to be involved 
in walnut characteristics, including JrPXC1, JrWAKL8, JrGAMYB, and JrFRK1. 
Specifically, the JrPXC1 gene was confirmed to participate in the regulation of 
secondary wall cellulose thickening in the walnut shell.
CONCLUSION: In addition to providing considerable available genetic resources 
for walnut trees, this study revealed the underlying genetic basis involved in 
important walnut agronomic traits, particularly shell thickness, as well as 
providing clues for the improvement of genetic breeding and domestication in 
other perennial economic crops.
