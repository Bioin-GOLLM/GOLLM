Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), remains a 
significant global health issue, with high morbidity and mortality rates. The 
emergence of drug-resistant strains, particularly multidrug-resistant TB 
(MDR-TB), poses difficult challenges to TB control efforts. This comprehensive 
review and meta-analysis investigated the prevalence of and molecular insights 
into isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) resistance-conferring mutations in M. 
tb isolates from South Africa. Through systematic search and analysis of 11 
relevant studies, we determined the prevalence of gene mutations associated with 
RIF and INH resistance, such as rpoB, katG, and inhA. The findings demonstrated 
a high prevalence of specific mutations, including S450L in rpoB, and S315T, 
which are linked to resistance against RIF and INH, respectively. These results 
contribute to the understanding of drug resistance mechanisms and provide 
valuable insights for the development of targeted interventions against 
drug-resistant TB.
