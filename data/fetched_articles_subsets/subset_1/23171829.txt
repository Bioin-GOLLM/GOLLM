BACKGROUND: The effects of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181T/sW172* mutation on 
viral replication and pathogenicity was concerned recently. This study aimed to 
investigate the biological characteristics of rtA181T/sW172* mutant strain of 
HBV in animal model.
METHODS: The rtA181T/sW172* mutant plasmid was constructed using the pHBV4.1 
(wild type HBV) as a template. The wild and mutant HBV replication mouse models 
were established utilizing a hydrodynamic technique. The titers of hepatitis B 
surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen, and HBV DNA in serum, and the 
levels of HBsAg, hepatitis B core antigen(HBcAg), HBV DNA replication 
intermediates (HBV DNA RI) and HBV RNA in liver were measured after 1, 3, 5, 7, 
10, 12 and 15 days of plasmid injection.
RESULTS: In wild-type HBV replication mouse model, serum HBsAg was high on day 
1, 3, and 5, but became lower since day 7; while in mutant HBV mouse model, 
serum HBsAg was always at very low level. In liver tissues, HBV DNA RI of wild 
type HBV was detected on day 1 after transfection. The level subsequently peaked 
on day 3, gradually declined after day 5, and was almost undetectable on day 10. 
However, the HBV DNA RI levels of the mutant strain were always higher and 
lasted longer until day 15. Consistently, the expression levels of HBsAg and 
HBcAg in liver of the mutant group were significantly increased.
CONCLUSIONS: In the case of the HBV rtA181T/sW172* mutation, the secretion of 
serum HBsAg was impaired, whereas HBV DNA replication and HBsAg/HBcAg expression 
were increased in liver. These results suggest that the mutation can impair 
HBsAg secretion, and may cause the accumulation of viral core particles in 
liver.
