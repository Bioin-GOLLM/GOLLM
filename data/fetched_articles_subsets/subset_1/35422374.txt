OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of IL-6 inhibitors compared to standard of 
care (SOC) in COVID-19 patients.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of the MEDLINE and Scopus databases (last 
search: October 8th, 2021) was performed according to the PRISMA statement.
STUDY SELECTION: Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing IL-6 inhibitors to 
SOC in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were deemed eligible.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Individual patient data were extracted from the 
Kaplan-Meier curves or were obtained from authors of included studies. 
Additionally, the reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed study 
quality of each eligible report.
RESULTS: Eleven studies were identified, incorporating 7467 patients (IL-6 
inhibitors: 4103, SOC: 3364). IL-6 inhibitors were associated with decreased 
risk for death compared to SOC at the one-stage meta-analysis (Hazard Ratio 
[HR]: 0.75, 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.82, p<0.0001) and the two-stage 
meta-analysis (HR: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.77-0.93, p<0.001, I2 = 0.0%). Meta-regression 
analysis revealed that the difference in OS between the two groups was not 
influenced by the mean age of patients. At secondary meta-analyses, IL-6 
inhibitors were associated with decreased odds for intubation OR:0.74, 
95%CI:0.65-0.85, p<0.001, I2=0.0%). IL-6 inhibitors were associated with 
increased odds for discharge compared to SOC (OR:1.28, 95% CI:1.15-1.42, 
p<0.001, I2=0.0%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis of individual patient data from 
randomized trials shows that IL-6 inhibitors significantly reduce the risk of 
death compared to SOC. IL-6 inhibitors are also associated with better outcomes 
in terms of intubation and discharge rates compared to SOC.
