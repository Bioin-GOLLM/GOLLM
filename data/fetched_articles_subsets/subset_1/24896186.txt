Intracranial germ cell tumours (IGCTs) are a group of rare heterogeneous brain 
tumours that are clinically and histologically similar to the more common 
gonadal GCTs. IGCTs show great variation in their geographical and gender 
distribution, histological composition and treatment outcomes. The incidence of 
IGCTs is historically five- to eightfold greater in Japan and other East Asian 
countries than in Western countries, with peak incidence near the time of 
puberty. About half of the tumours are located in the pineal region. The 
male-to-female incidence ratio is approximately 3-4:1 overall, but is even 
higher for tumours located in the pineal region. Owing to the scarcity of tumour 
specimens available for research, little is currently known about this rare 
disease. Here we report the analysis of 62 cases by next-generation sequencing, 
single nucleotide polymorphism array and expression array. We find the KIT/RAS 
signalling pathway frequently mutated in more than 50% of IGCTs, including novel 
recurrent somatic mutations in KIT, its downstream mediators KRAS and NRAS, and 
its negative regulator CBL. Novel somatic alterations in the AKT/mTOR pathway 
included copy number gains of the AKT1 locus at 14q32.33 in 19% of patients, 
with corresponding upregulation of AKT1 expression. We identified 
loss-of-function mutations in BCORL1, a transcriptional co-repressor and tumour 
suppressor. We report significant enrichment of novel and rare germline variants 
in JMJD1C, which codes for a histone demethylase and is a coactivator of the 
androgen receptor, among Japanese IGCT patients. This study establishes a 
molecular foundation for understanding the biology of IGCTs and suggests 
potentially promising therapeutic strategies focusing on the inhibition of 
KIT/RAS activation and the AKT1/mTOR pathway.
