Liver diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality. Dental pulp 
pluripotent-like stem cells (DPPSCs) are of a considerable promise in tissue 
engineering and regenerative medicine as a new source of tissue-specific cells; 
therefore, this study is aimed at demonstrating their ability to generate 
functional hepatocyte-like cells in vitro. Cells were differentiated on a 
collagen scaffold in serum-free media supplemented with growth factors and 
cytokines to recapitulate liver development. At day 5, the differentiated DPPSC 
cells expressed the endodermal markers FOXA1 and FOXA2. Then, the cells were 
derived into the hepatic lineage generating hepatocyte-like cells. In addition 
to the associated morphological changes, the cells expressed the hepatic genes 
HNF6 and AFP. The terminally differentiated hepatocyte-like cells expressed the 
liver functional proteins albumin and CYP3A4. In this study, we report an 
efficient serum-free protocol to differentiate DPPSCs into functional 
hepatocyte-like cells. Our approach promotes the use of DPPSCs as a new source 
of adult stem cells for prospective use in liver regenerative medicine.
