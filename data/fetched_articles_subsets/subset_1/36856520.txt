OBJECTIVE: Polycythemia Vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized 
by the overproduction of red blood cells. First-line therapies are directed at 
lowering hematocrit levels. After the discovery of a mutation in the Janus 
kinase 2 (JAK2V617F), JAK2 inhibitors have been tested as second-line therapies. 
Despite these approaches, there is still the need for a major comprehension of 
the mechanisms involved in PV erythrocytosis and of more effective therapies. 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) stimulates hematopoietic precursors 
proliferation and erythroid differentiation. We thus hypothesized that ACE 
inhibition could help in controlling erythrocytosis in PV.
METHODS: We assessed the clonogenic potential by colony-forming unit (CFU) assay 
of mononuclear cells isolated from PV JAK2 positive or JAK2 negative patients 
with erythrocytosis treated with enalaprilat or losartan.
RESULTS: Treatment with drugs led to a decrease of erythroid precursor frequency 
both in the presence and absence of JAK2 mutation, with a high extent in JAK2 
positive cells and without affecting other types of precursors. No 
dose-dependent effect was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that ACE inhibition reduces erythroid 
precursor frequency, confirming the involvement of ACE in erythrocytosis despite 
the presence of JAK2 mutation and encouraging the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors 
and AT1R antagonists could help in directly managing erythrocytosis in PV.
