Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a prevalent nosocomial 
pathogen, causing a wide range of diseases. The increased frequency of MRSA 
isolates in hospitals and the emergence of vancomycin resistance have sparked 
the search for new control strategies. This study aimed to characterize 
sixty-seven MRSA isolates collected from both infected patients and asymptomatic 
carriers in a Spanish hospital. RAPD-PCR allowed the identification of six 
genetic patterns. We also investigated the presence of genes involved in 
producing adhesins, toxins and the capsule; the biofilm; and antimicrobial 
resistance. A notable percentage of the isolates carried virulence genes and 
showed medium-high ability to form biofilms. Next, we assessed the strains' 
susceptibility to two phages (phiIPLA-C1C and phiIPLA-RODI) and one endolysin 
(LysRODI). All strains were resistant to phiIPLA-C1C, and most (70.2%) were 
susceptible to phiIPLA-RODI. Regarding LysRODI, all strains displayed 
susceptibility, although to varying degrees. There was a correlation between 
endolysin susceptibility and the random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) 
profile or the presence of some virulence genes (fnbA, eta, etb, PVL and czr), 
but that was not observed with biofilm-forming ability, strain origin or phage 
sensitivity. Taken together, these findings can help to explain the factors 
influencing endolysin effectiveness, which will contribute to the development of 
efficient therapies targeting MRSA infections.
