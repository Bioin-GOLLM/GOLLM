A simple and efficient microwave (MW)-assisted method was elaborated for the 
catalyst-free synthesis of isoindolin-1-one-3-phosphonates by the 
three-component condensation of 2-formylbenzoic acid, aliphatic primary amines 
and various dialkyl phosphites. The batch and the continuous flow reactions were 
optimized in respect of the temperature, the reaction time and the molar ratio 
of the starting materials. To evaluate the potential of MW irradiation, 
comparative thermal experiments were also carried out. In order to obtain "real 
time" information about the condensation, the special Kabachnik-Fields reaction 
of 2-formylbenzoic acid, butylamine and diethyl phosphite was monitored by in 
situ FT-IR spectroscopy. The novel title compounds could be prepared in high 
yields at low temperature under a short reaction time. A suitable method could 
also be developed for the preparation of the isoindolin-1-one-3-phosphonates at 
a "few g" scale by using a continuous flow MW reactor.
