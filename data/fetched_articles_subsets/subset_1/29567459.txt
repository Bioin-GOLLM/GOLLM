A series of 1-aroylindoline-hydroxamic acids have been synthesized in the 
present study. The results of the biological evaluation led to the 
identification of compound 12 as dual HDAC6/HSP90 inhibitor. Compound 12 
displayed striking inhibitory effects towards the HDAC6 isoform and HSP 90 
protein with IC50 values of 1.15 nM (HDAC6) and 46.3 nM (HSP90). Compound 12 
also exhibited 113, 139 and 246 fold higher selectivity for HDAC6 over HDAC 1, 
HDAC 3 and HDAC 8 isoforms and was endowed with significant cytotoxic effects 
with GI50 values ranging 1.04-1.61 μM against lung A549, colorectal HCT116, 
leukemia HL60, and EGFR T790M mutant lung H1975 cell lines. Another interesting 
finding of the study was substantial cytotoxic effects of compounds particularly 
against lung H1975 (NSCLC) cell lines with IC50 = 0.26 μM which may be mediated 
through HSP90 inhibition. Compound 8 as such was devoid of HDAC inhibitory 
activity.
