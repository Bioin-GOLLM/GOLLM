Autosomal dominant late-onset retinal macular degeneration (L-ORMD) is caused by 
a single S163R mutation in the C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein 5 
(C1QTNF5) gene. The C1QTNF5 gene encodes a secreted and membrane-associated 
protein involved in adhesion of retinal pigmented epithelial cells (RPE) to 
Bruch's membrane. The crystal structure of the trimeric globular domain of human 
C1QTNF5 at 1.34Å resolution reveals unique features of this novel C1q family 
member. It lacks a Ca²⁺-binding site, displays a remarkable non-uniform 
distribution of surface electrostatic potentials and possesses a unique sequence 
(F₁₈₁F₁₈₂G₁₈₃G₁₈₄W₁₈₅P₁₈₆) that forms a hydrophobic plateau surrounded by Lys 
and Arg residues with a solvent cavity underneath. S₁₆₃ forms a hydrogen bond 
with F₁₈₂ in a hydrophobic area extending to the hydrophobic plateau. The 
pathogenic mutation S163R disrupts this hydrogen bonding and positively charges 
these hydrophobic areas. Thus, our analysis provides insights into the 
structural basis of the L-ORMD disease mechanism.
