Intestinal epithelium development is dramatically impaired in germfree rodents, 
but the consequences of the absence of microbiota have been overlooked in other 
epithelia. In the present study, we present the first description of the 
bacterial communities associated with the olfactory epithelium and explored 
differences in olfactory epithelium characteristics between germfree and 
conventional, specific pathogen-free, mice. While the anatomy of the olfactory 
epithelium was not significantly different, we observed a thinner olfactory 
cilia layer along with a decreased cellular turn-over in germfree mice. Using 
electro-olfactogram, we recorded the responses of olfactory sensitive neuronal 
populations to various odorant stimulations. We observed a global increase in 
the amplitude of responses to odorants in germfree mice as well as altered 
responses kinetics. These changes were associated with a decreased transcription 
of most olfactory transduction actors and of olfactory xenobiotic metabolising 
enzymes. Overall, we present here the first evidence that the microbiota 
modulates the physiology of olfactory epithelium. As olfaction is a major 
sensory modality for most animal species, the microbiota may have an important 
impact on animal physiology and behaviour through olfaction alteration.
