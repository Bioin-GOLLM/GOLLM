BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is widely used in treating cervical cancer patients, 
however, radioresistance unavoidably occurs and seriously affects the treatment 
effect. It is well known that hypoxia plays an important role in promoting 
radioresistance in tumor microenvironment, yet our understanding of the effect 
of small extracellular vesicles miRNA on cervical cancer radiosensitivity in 
hypoxic environment is still limited.
METHODS: Small extracellular vesicles extracted from hypoxic and normoxic 
cultured cervical cancer cells were evaluated for their effects on 
radioresistance. miR-152-3p was found to be a potential effector in 
hypoxia-derived extracellular vesicles by searching the GEO database. Its 
downstream substrate was confirmed by double luciferase report, which was KLF15. 
The role of miR-152-3p and KLF15 in regulating cervical cancer radioresistance 
was detected by cell activity assays. The findings were confirmed in vivo by 
animal models. The expression of miR-152-3p was quantified by qRT-PCR and its 
prognostic significance was evaluated.
RESULTS: Hypoxic environment promoted the secretion of small extracellular 
vesicles, and reduced the apoptosis and DNA damage caused by radiation, 
accompanied by increased expression of small extracellular vesicles miR-152-3p 
from hypoxic cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, small extracellular vesicles 
miR-152-3p promoted Hela xenograft growth and reduced the radiosensitivity vivo. 
Mechanism studies revealed that KLF15 protein was the downstream target of 
miR-152-3p in regulating radioresistance.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that small extracellular vesicles miR-152-3p 
affects the therapeutic effect of radiotherapy and holds potential as a 
biomarker or therapeutic target for cervical cancer prognosis and improving 
radiotherapy.
