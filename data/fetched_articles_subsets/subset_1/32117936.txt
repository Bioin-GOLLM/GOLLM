3D bioprinting combines cells with a supportive bioink to fabricate multiscale, 
multi-cellular structures that imitate native tissues. Here, we demonstrate how 
our novel fibrin-based bioink formulation combined with drug releasing 
microspheres can serve as a tool for bioprinting tissues using human induced 
pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs). 
Microspheres, small spherical particles that generate controlled drug release, 
promote hiPSC differentiation into dopaminergic neurons when used to deliver 
small molecules like guggulsterone. We used the microfluidics based RX1 
bioprinter to generate domes with a 1 cm diameter consisting of our novel 
fibrin-based bioink containing guggulsterone microspheres and hiPSC-derived 
NPCs. The resulting tissues exhibited over 90% cellular viability 1 day post 
printing that then increased to 95% 7 days post printing. The bioprinted tissues 
expressed the early neuronal marker, TUJ1 and the early midbrain marker, 
Forkhead Box A2 (FOXA2) after 15 days of culture. These bioprinted neural 
tissues expressed TUJ1 (15 ± 1.3%), the dopamine marker, tyrosine hydroxylase 
(TH) (8 ± 1%) and other glial markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP) (15 ± 4%) and oligodendrocyte progenitor marker (O4) (4 ± 1%) after 30 
days. Also, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed these 
bioprinted tissues expressed TUJ1, NURR1 (gene expressed in midbrain 
dopaminergic neurons), LMX1B, TH, and PAX6 after 30 days. In conclusion, we have 
demonstrated that using a microsphere-laden bioink to bioprint hiPSC-derived 
NPCs can promote the differentiation of neural tissue.
