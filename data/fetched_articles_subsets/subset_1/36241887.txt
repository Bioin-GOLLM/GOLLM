Genetic associations with macroscopic brain structure can provide insights into 
brain function and disease. However, specific associations with measures of 
local brain folding are largely under-explored. Here, we conducted large-scale 
genome- and exome-wide associations of regional cortical sulcal measures derived 
from magnetic resonance imaging scans of 40,169 individuals in UK Biobank. We 
discovered 388 regional brain folding associations across 77 genetic loci, with 
genes in associated loci enriched for expression in the cerebral cortex, 
neuronal development processes, and differential regulation during early brain 
development. We integrated brain eQTLs to refine genes for various loci, 
implicated several genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, and 
highlighted global genetic correlations with neuropsychiatric phenotypes. We 
provide an interactive 3D visualisation of our summary associations, emphasising 
added resolution of regional analyses. Our results offer new insights into the 
genetic architecture of brain folding and provide a resource for future studies 
of sulcal morphology in health and disease.
