BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) activates oncogenic signaling 
pathways and induces inflammation to promote colorectal carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We characterized F. nucleatum and its subspecies in colorectal tumors 
and examined associations with tumor characteristics and colorectal 
cancer-specific survival. We conducted deep sequencing of nusA, nusG, and 
bacterial 16s rRNA genes in tumors from 1,994 patients with colorectal cancer 
and assessed associations between F. nucleatum presence and clinical 
characteristics, colorectal cancer-specific mortality, and somatic mutations.
RESULTS: F. nucleatum, which was present in 10.3% of tumors, was detected in a 
higher proportion of right-sided and advanced-stage tumors, particularly 
subspecies animalis. Presence of F. nucleatum was associated with higher 
colorectal cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.97; P = 0.0004). This association 
was restricted to nonhypermutated, microsatellite-stable tumors (HR, 2.13; P = 
0.0002) and those who received chemotherapy [HR, 1.92; confidence interval (CI), 
1.07-3.45; P = 0.029). Only F. nucleatum subspecies animalis, the main 
subspecies detected (65.8%), was associated with colorectal cancer-specific 
mortality (HR, 2.16; P = 0.0016), subspecies vincentii and nucleatum were not 
(HR, 1.07; P = 0.86). Additional adjustment for tumor stage suggests that the 
effect of F. nucleatum on mortality is partly driven by a stage shift. Presence 
of F. nucleatum was associated with microsatellite instable tumors, tumors with 
POLE exonuclease domain mutations, and ERBB3 mutations, and suggestively 
associated with TP53 mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: F. nucleatum, and particularly subspecies animalis, was associated 
with a higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality and specific somatic mutated 
genes.
IMPACT: Our findings identify the F. nucleatum subspecies animalis as negatively 
impacting colorectal cancer mortality, which may occur through a stage shift and 
its effect on chemoresistance.
