AIM: To identify clinical and/or genetic predictors of response to several 
therapies in Crohn's disease (CD) patients.
METHODS: We included 242 patients with CD (133 females) aged (mean ± standard 
deviation) 39 ± 12 years and a disease duration of 12 ± 8 years. The 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) studied were ABCB1 C3435T and G2677T/A, 
IL23R G1142A, C2370A, and G9T, CASP9 C93T, Fas G670A and LgC844T, and ATG16L1 
A898G. Genotyping was performed with real-time PCR with Taqman probes.
RESULTS: Older patients responded better to 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and to 
azathioprine (OR 1.07, p = 0.003 and OR 1.03, p = 0.01, respectively) while 
younger ones responded better to biologicals (OR 0.95, p = 0.06). Previous 
surgery negatively influenced response to 5-ASA compounds (OR 0.25, p = 0.05), 
but favoured response to azathioprine (OR 2.1, p = 0.04). In respect to genetic 
predictors, we observed that heterozygotes for ATGL16L1 SNP had a significantly 
higher chance of responding to corticosteroids (OR 2.51, p = 0.04), while 
homozygotes for Casp9 C93T SNP had a lower chance of responding both to 
corticosteroids and to azathioprine (OR 0.23, p = 0.03 and OR 0.08, p = 0.02,). 
TT carriers of ABCB1 C3435T SNP had a higher chance of responding to 
azathioprine (OR 2.38, p = 0.01), while carriers of ABCB1 G2677T/A SNP, as well 
as responding better to azathioprine (OR 1.89, p = 0.07), had a lower chance of 
responding to biologicals (OR 0.31, p = 0.07), which became significant after 
adjusting for gender (OR 0.75, p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we were able to identify a number of clinical 
and genetic predictors of response to several therapies which may become of 
potential utility in clinical practice. These are preliminary results that need 
to be replicated in future pharmacogenomic studies.
