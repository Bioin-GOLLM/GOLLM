The oxygenation state of erythrocytes is known to impact several cellular 
processes. As the only known O2-binding protein in red blood cells, haemoglobin 
has been implicated in the oxygenation-mediated control of cell pathways and 
properties. Band 3, an integral membrane protein linked to the spectrin/actin 
cytoskeleton, preferentially binds deoxygenated haemoglobin at its N-terminus, 
and has been postulated to participate in the mechanism by which oxygenation 
controls cellular processes. Because the ankyrin-binding site on band 3 is 
located near the deoxyHb (deoxygenated haemoglobin)-binding site, we 
hypothesized that deoxyHb might impact the association between band 3 and the 
underlying erythrocyte cytoskeleton, a link that is primarily established 
through band 3-ankyrin bridging. In the present paper we show that deoxygenation 
of human erythrocytes results in displacement of ankyrin from band 3, leading to 
release of the spectrin/actin cytoskeleton from the membrane. This weakening of 
membrane-cytoskeletal interactions during brief periods of deoxygenation could 
prove beneficial to blood flow, but during episodes of prolonged deoxygenation, 
such as during sickle cell occlusive crises, could promote unwanted membrane 
vesiculation.
