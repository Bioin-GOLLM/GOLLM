AIM: Explore the role of viral factors and immune response in patients with 
severe pandemic pdmH1N1 illness without significant co-morbidity.
MATERIALS: Seven patients with pdmH1N1 influenza, bilateral chest X-rays 
infiltrates, requiring mechanical ventilator support were consecutively 
recruited. Seven age- and gender-matched healthy individuals served as controls.
RESULTS: Four patients were viremic, two with the mutant D222G/N 
pdmH1N1.Microarray analyses of peripheral blood leukocytes suggested a marked 
granulocytes activation, but no up-regulation of inflammatory cytokine mRNA. 
Patients with severe pdmH1NI had a marked systemic complement activation, and in 
contrast to the lack of cytokine mRNA up-regulation in blood leukocytes, plasma 
levels of a broad range of inflammatory mediators, including IP-10, and 
mediators involved in pulmonary remodelling were markedly elevated. Patients 
with mutant virus had particularly high IP-10 levels, and the most pronounced 
complement activation.
CONCLUSIONS: In severe pdmH1N1, viremia was common and the D222G/N mutant was 
found in half of the viremic patients. Host immune response was characterized by 
strong activation of the innate immune system, including complement and 
granulocytes activation, increased serum levels of inflammation and pulmonary 
remodelling markers, possibly contributing to the observed tissue damage. 
However, few patients were included and further studies are needed to 
characterize the immune response in severe pdmH1N1 infection.
