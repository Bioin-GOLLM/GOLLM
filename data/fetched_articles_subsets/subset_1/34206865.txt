The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created a public health crisis worldwide. Although 
vaccines against the virus are efficiently being rolled out, they are proving to 
be ineffective against certain emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The high degree of 
sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses (HCoV) 
presents the opportunity for designing vaccines that may offer protection 
against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants, with cross-protection against 
other HCoVs. In this study, we performed bioinformatics analyses to identify T 
and B cell epitopes originating from spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope 
protein sequences found to be evolutionarily conserved among seven major HCoVs. 
Evolutionary conservation of these epitopes indicates that they may have 
critical roles in viral fitness and are, therefore, unlikely to mutate during 
viral replication thus making such epitopes attractive candidates for a vaccine. 
Our designed vaccine construct comprises of twelve T and six B cell epitopes 
that are conserved among HCoVs. The vaccine is predicted to be soluble in water, 
stable, have a relatively long half-life, and exhibit low allergenicity and 
toxicity. Our docking results showed that the vaccine forms stable complex with 
toll-like receptor 4, while the immune simulations predicted that the vaccine 
may elicit strong IgG, IgM, and cytotoxic T cell responses. Therefore, from 
multiple perspectives, our multi-subunit vaccine design shows the potential to 
elicit a strong immune-protective response against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging 
variants while carrying minimal risk for causing adverse effects.
