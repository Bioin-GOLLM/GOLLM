Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) was 
demonstrated in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) to reduce mortality 
from the disease. European mortality data has recently become available from the 
Nelson randomised controlled trial, which confirmed lung cancer mortality 
reductions by 26% in men and 39-61% in women. Recent studies in Europe and the 
USA also showed positive results in screening workers exposed to asbestos. All 
European experts attending the "Initiative for European Lung Screening (IELS)"-a 
large international group of physicians and other experts concerned with lung 
cancer-agreed that LDCT-LCS should be implemented in Europe. However, the 
economic impact of LDCT-LCS and guidelines for its effective and safe 
implementation still need to be formulated. To this purpose, the IELS was asked 
to prepare recommendations to implement LCS and examine outstanding issues. A 
subgroup carried out a comprehensive literature review on LDCT-LCS and presented 
findings at a meeting held in Milan in November 2018. The present 
recommendations reflect that consensus was reached.
