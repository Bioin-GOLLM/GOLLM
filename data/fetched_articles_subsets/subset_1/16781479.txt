The molecular basis of polycythemia vera is discussed in the context of the JAK2 
V617F mutation, in our view the most important advance in understanding the 
pathogenesis of polycythemia vera. This chapter discusses the nature of the JAK2 
V617F mutation including the studies demonstrating its role in erythropoietin 
independence and hypersensitivity and endogenous erythroid colony formation. The 
evolving evidence that JAK2 V617F is not specific for polycythemia vera 
pathogenesis and the development of disease phenotype is presented as well as 
alternative candidates for pathogenic mutations such as the protein tyrosine 
phosphatases and SOCS-3. Finally, the clinical correlations and implications of 
the JAK2 V617F mutation are discussed.
