The title compound, C(22)H(22)N(2), was prepared by the reaction of 
4-amino-toluene with sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and potassium 
permanganate. The mol-ecule is disposed about a crystallographic inversion 
centre with one half-mol-ecule comprising the asymmetric unit. The dihedral 
angle between the terminal and central benzene rings is 88.05 (1)°. The crystal 
packing is stabilized by van der Waals forces.
