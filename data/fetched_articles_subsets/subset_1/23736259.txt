The vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) associated protein B (VAPB) is an 
integral membrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The P56S 
mutation in VAPB has been linked to motor neuron degeneration in amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis type 8 (ALS8) and forms ER-like inclusions in various model 
systems. However, the role of wild-type and mutant VAPB in neurons is poorly 
understood. Here, we identified Yip1-interacting factor homologue A (YIF1A) as a 
new VAPB binding partner and important component in the early secretory pathway. 
YIF1A interacts with VAPB via its transmembrane regions, recycles between the ER 
and Golgi and is mainly localized to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartments 
(ERGICs) in rat hippocampal neurons. VAPB strongly affects the distribution of 
YIF1A and is required for intracellular membrane trafficking into dendrites and 
normal dendritic morphology. When VAPB-P56S is present, YIF1A is recruited to 
the VAPB-P56S clusters and loses its ERGIC localization. These data suggest that 
both VAPB and YIF1A are important for ER-to-Golgi transport and that missorting 
of YIF1A may contribute to VAPB-associated motor neuron disease.
