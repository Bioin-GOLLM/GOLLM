Amyloidosis is an uncommon disease that is characterized by abnormal 
extracellular deposition of misfolded protein fibrils leading to organ 
dysfunction. The deposited proteins display common chemical and histologic 
properties but can vary dramatically in their origin. Kidney disease is a common 
manifestation in patients with systemic amyloidosis with a number of 
amyloidogenic proteins discovered in kidney biopsy specimens. The emergence of 
mass spectrometry-based proteomics has added to the diagnostic accuracy and 
overall understanding of amyloidosis. This in-depth review discusses the general 
histopathologic features of renal amyloidosis and includes an in-depth 
discussion of specific forms of amyloid affecting the kidney.
