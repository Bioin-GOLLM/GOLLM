PURPOSE: To investigate the association of OCT derived drusen measures in Amish 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients with known loci for macular 
degeneration.
METHODS: Members of the Old Order Amish community in Pennsylvania ages 50 and 
older were assessed for drusen area, volume and regions of retinal pigment 
epithelium (RPE) atrophy using a Cirrus High- Definition-OCT. Measurements were 
obtained in the macula region within a central circle (CC) of 3 mm diameter and 
a surrounding perifoveal ring (PR) of 3 to 5 mm diameter using the Cirrus OCT 
RPE analysis software. Other demographic information including age, gender and 
smoking status were collected. Study subjects were further genotyped to 
determine their risk for the AMD associated SNPs in SYN3, LIPC, ARMS2, C3, CFB, 
CETP, CFI and CFH genes using TaqMan genotyping assays. The association of 
genotypes with OCT measures were assessed using linear trend p-values calculated 
from univariate and multivariate generalized linear models.
RESULTS: 432 eyes were included in the analysis. Multivariate analysis (adjusted 
by age, gender and smoking status) confirmed the known significant association 
between AMD and macular drusen with the number of CFH risk alleles for drusen 
area (area increased 0.12 mm2 for a risk allele increase, p<0.01), drusen volume 
(volume increased 0.01 mm3 for a risk allele increase, p≤0.05) and area of RPE 
atrophy (area increased 0.43 mm2 for a risk allele increase, p=0.003). SYN3 risk 
allele G is significantly associated with larger area PR (area increased 0.09 
mm2 for a risk allele increase, p=0.03) and larger drusen volume in central 
circle (volume increased 0.01 mm3 for a risk allele increase, p=0.04).
CONCLUSION: Among the genotyped SNPs tested, the CFH risk genotype appears to 
play a major role in determining the drusen phenotype in the Amish AMD 
population.
