Examination of the saline fermentation products from the marine-derived 
ascomycete fungal strain CNL-523 (Cryptosphaeria sp.) resulted in the isolation 
of cryptosphaerolide (1). The new compound is an ester-substituted 
sesquiterpenoid related to the eremophilane class. The structure of the new 
compound was assigned by spectroscopic and chemical methods. Cryptosphaerolide 
was found to be an inhibitor of the protein Mcl-1, a cancer drug target involved 
in apoptosis. It also showed significant cytotoxicity against an HCT-116 human 
colon carcinoma cell line, indicating that the compound may be of value in 
exploring the Mcl-1 pathway as a target for cancer chemotherapy.
