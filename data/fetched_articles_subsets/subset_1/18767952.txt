Loss of p53 tumor-suppressor function is the most common abnormality in human 
cancer, which can result in enhanced presentation to immune cells of wild-type 
(wt)-sequence peptides from tumor p53 molecules, thus providing the rationale 
for wt p53 peptide-based cancer vaccines. We review evidence from preclinical 
murine tumor models and preclinical studies that led to the clinical 
introduction of wt p53 peptide-based vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. Overall, 
this review illustrates the complex process of wt p53 epitope selection and the 
issues and concerns involved in the application of p53-based vaccines for 
patients with cancer.
