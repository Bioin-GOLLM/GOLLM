OBJECTIVE: Abnormal B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and interleukin-19 (IL-19) 
expression is closely related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
pathogenesis. We aimed to determine whether BCL2 polymorphisms and a single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of IL19 are significantly associated with SLE 
susceptibility and if this is affected by synergism between IL19 and BCL2 
genotypes.
METHODS: This observational cohort study randomly enrolled 150 patients with SLE 
and 150 healthy controls. Major BCL2 and IL19 allele and genotype distributions 
were examined in the two groups. The IL19 SNP rs2243188 was determined using the 
TaqMan-MGB probe method. The synergistic effect between BCL2 and IL19 and 
clinical symptoms of SLE was also analyzed.
RESULTS: The distribution of major BCL2 genotypes and common BCL2 alleles, 
especially for genotypes 191, 193, and 197, differed significantly between 
patients and controls. A significant difference in the dominant genetic model 
was also observed between groups, but not in the recessive model. The risk of 
disease in individuals who carried both 195-bp BCL2 and 138-bp IL19 
susceptibility alleles was higher than in those carrying either allele alone.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggested that BCL2 polymorphisms and the 
IL19 SNP rs2243188 are closely related to the pathogenesis of SLE.
