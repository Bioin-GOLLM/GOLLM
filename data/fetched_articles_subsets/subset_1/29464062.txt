Cell-cell fusion describes the process by which two cells combine their plasma 
membranes and become a single cell, possessing and retaining certain genetic 
information from each parent cell. Here, using a Cre-loxP-based method initially 
developed to investigate extracellular vesicle targeting, we found that cancer 
cells spontaneously and rapidly deliver DNA to non-cancer cells in vitro via a 
cell-cell fusion event. The resulting hybrid cells were aneuploid and possessed 
enhanced clonal diversity and chemoresistance compared to non-hybrid cancer 
cells. We also observed cell-cell fusion to occur in vivo between melanoma cells 
and non-cancer cells of both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic lineages. These 
findings suggest that cell-cell fusion occurs during the natural progression of 
cancer and show that this mechanism has the potential to cause massive genomic 
alterations that are observed in cancer. Furthermore, these findings somewhat 
contradict recent publications suggesting that the Cre-loxP method measures only 
extracellular vesicle-mediated intercellular communication.
