Musical hallucinations are a relatively rare form of auditory hallucination 
characterized by hearing of music in the absence of any external stimuli. This 
phenomenon has been linked to both psychiatric and structural lesions. We 
present the case of a previously healthy young male whose presentation with 
musical hallucinations led to the diagnosis of a rare tumour, anaplastic 
pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.
