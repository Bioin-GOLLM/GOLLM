Complex biological systems rely on cell surface cues that govern cellular 
self-recognition and selective interactions with appropriate partners. Molecular 
diversification of cell surface recognition molecules through DNA recombination 
and complex alternative splicing has emerged as an important principle for 
encoding such interactions. However, the lack of tools to specifically detect 
and quantify receptor protein isoforms is a major impediment to functional 
studies. We here developed a workflow for targeted mass spectrometry by selected 
reaction monitoring that permits quantitative assessment of highly diversified 
protein families. We apply this workflow to dissecting the molecular diversity 
of the neuronal neurexin receptors and uncover an alternative splicing-dependent 
recognition code for synaptic ligands.
