Plants, along with other multicellular organisms, have evolved specialized 
regulatory mechanisms to achieve proper tissue growth and morphogenesis. During 
development, growing tissues generate specialized cell types and complex 
patterns necessary for establishing the function of the organ. Tissue growth is 
a tightly regulated process that yields highly reproducible outcomes. 
Nevertheless, the underlying cellular and molecular behaviors are often 
stochastic. Thus, how does stochasticity, together with strict genetic 
regulation, give rise to reproducible tissue development? This review draws 
examples from plants as well as other systems to explore stochasticity in plant 
cell division, growth, and patterning. We conclude that stochasticity is often 
needed to create small differences between identical cells, which are amplified 
and stabilized by genetic and mechanical feedback loops to begin cell 
differentiation. These first few differentiating cells initiate traditional 
patterning mechanisms to ensure regular development.
