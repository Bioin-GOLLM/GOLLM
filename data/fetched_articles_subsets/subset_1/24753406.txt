Chromatin remodeling factors play an active role in the DNA damage response by 
shaping chromatin to facilitate the repair process. The spatiotemporal 
regulation of these factors is key to their function, yet poorly understood. We 
report that the structural nuclear protein NuMA accumulates at sites of DNA 
damage in a poly[ADP-ribose]ylation-dependent manner and functionally interacts 
with the ISWI ATPase SNF2h/SMARCA5, a chromatin remodeler that facilitates DNA 
repair. NuMA coimmunoprecipitates with SNF2h, regulates its diffusion in the 
nucleoplasm and controls its accumulation at DNA breaks. Consistent with NuMA 
enabling SNF2h function, cells with silenced NuMA exhibit reduced chromatin 
decompaction after DNA cleavage, lesser focal recruitment of homologous 
recombination repair factors, impaired DNA double-strand break repair in 
chromosomal (but not in episomal) contexts and increased sensitivity to DNA 
cross-linking agents. These findings reveal a structural basis for the 
orchestration of chromatin remodeling whereby a scaffold protein promotes genome 
maintenance by directing a remodeler to DNA breaks.
