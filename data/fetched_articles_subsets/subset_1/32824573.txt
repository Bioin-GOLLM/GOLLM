The COVID-19 pandemic has spread very fast around the world. A few days after 
the first detected case in South Africa, an infection started in a large 
hospital outbreak in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Phylogenetic analysis of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes can be used 
to trace the path of transmission within a hospital. It can also identify the 
source of the outbreak and provide lessons to improve infection prevention and 
control strategies. This manuscript outlines the obstacles encountered in order 
to genotype SARS-CoV-2 in near-real time during an urgent outbreak 
investigation. This included problems with the length of the original genotyping 
protocol, unavailability of reagents, and sample degradation and storage. 
Despite this, three different library preparation methods for Illumina 
sequencing were set up, and the hands-on library preparation time was decreased 
from twelve to three hours, which enabled the outbreak investigation to be 
completed in just a few weeks. Furthermore, the new protocols increased the 
success rate of sequencing whole viral genomes. A simple bioinformatics workflow 
for the assembly of high-quality genomes in near-real time was also fine-tuned. 
In order to allow other laboratories to learn from our experience, all of the 
library preparation and bioinformatics protocols are publicly available at 
protocols.io and distributed to other laboratories of the Network for Genomics 
Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA) consortium.
