CONTEXT: Krüppel-like factor 11 (KLF11) is a transcription factor of the zinc 
finger domain family that has been shown to regulate expression of the insulin 
gene. An initial study reported that a KLF11 variant predicting a Q62R was 
associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in French Caucasians; however, subsequent 
studies have failed to identify an association between this variant and T2D in 
subjects from a similar Northern-European ancestry.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether the Q62R or other variants within 
KLF11 were associated with T2D in Pima Indians, a population with an extremely 
high prevalence of this disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: KLF11 was sequenced in 24 Pima Indians to 
identify potentially novel variants. There were 18 variants genotyped in a 
family-based sample of 1337 Pima Indians to analyze the linkage disequilibrium 
pattern of this gene and identify representative variants. Four representative 
variants were further genotyped in a population-based sample of 3501 
full-heritage Pima Indians for association analyses. Among these subjects, 413 
had undergone metabolic studies when they were nondiabetic to measure traits 
that predict T2D.
RESULTS: Neither the Q62R nor any other common variant in KLF11 was associated 
with T2D in the Pima population. In addition, no variant was associated with 
insulin secretion or insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Common variation in KLF11 variation does not appear to influence 
the population-based risk for developing T2D among full-heritage Pima Indians. 
Thus, KLF11 is unlikely to play a major role in the etiology of T2D among this 
Native American population.
