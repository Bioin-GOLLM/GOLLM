Protein modification by ubiquitin (Ub) is one of the most common 
posttranslational events in eukaryotic cells. Ubiquitinated proteins are 
destined to various fates such as proteasomal degradation, protein trafficking, 
DNA repair, and immune response. In the last decade, vast improvements of mass 
spectrometry make it feasible to analyze the minute amount of ubiquitinated 
components in vivo. When combined with quantitative strategies, such as stable 
isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), it is capable of 
profiling ubiquitinated proteome under different experimental conditions. Here, 
we describe a procedure to perform such a study, including differential protein 
labeling by the SILAC method, enrichment of ubiquitinated species, mass 
spectrometric analysis, and quality control to reduce false positives. The 
potential challenges and limitations of the procedure are also discussed.
