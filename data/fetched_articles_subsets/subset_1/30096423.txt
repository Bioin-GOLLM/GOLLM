Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH, EPHX2) elicits potent 
cardiovascular protective effects in preclinical models of ischemic 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and genetic polymorphisms in EPHX2 have been 
associated with developing ischemic CVD in humans. However, it remains unknown 
whether EPHX2 variants are associated with prognosis following an ischemic CVD 
event. We evaluated the association between EPHX2 p.Lys55Arg and p.Arg287Gln 
genotype with survival in 667 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. No 
association with p.Arg287Gln genotype was observed (P = 0.598). Caucasian EPHX2 
Arg55 carriers (Lys/Arg or Arg/Arg) had a significantly higher risk of 5-year 
mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.01-2.55, P = 0.045). In an independent population of 2712 ACS patients, this 
association was not replicated (adjusted HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70-1.21, P = 0.559). 
In a secondary analysis, Caucasian homozygous Arg55 allele carriers (Arg/Arg) 
appeared to exhibit a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR 2.60, 
95% CI 1.09-6.17). These results demonstrate that EPHX2 p.Lys55Arg and 
p.Arg287Gln polymorphisms do not significantly modify survival after an ACS 
event. Investigation of other sEH metabolism biomarkers in ischemic CVD appears 
warranted.
