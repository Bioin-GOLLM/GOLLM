BACKGROUND: Previous findings suggest that developmental exposures to persistent 
organochlorine pollutants (POPs) may be detrimental for the development of the 
immune system in the offspring. Whether these suspected immunoregulatory effects 
persist beyond early childhood remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between 
maternal serum concentrations of POPs and the risk of asthma in offspring after 
20 years of follow-up.
METHODS: A birth cohort with 965 women was formed in 1988-1989 in Aarhus, 
Denmark. Concentrations of six polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (congeners 118, 
138, 153, 156, 170, 180), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and 
dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p´-DDE) were quantified in maternal serum 
(n=872) collected in gestation week 30. Information about offspring use of 
asthma medications was obtained from the Danish Registry of Medicinal Product 
Statistics.
RESULTS: Maternal serum concentrations of HCB and dioxin-like PCB-118 were 
positively associated with offspring asthma medication use after 20 years of 
follow-up (p for trend<0.05). Compared with subjects in the first tertile of 
maternal concentration, those in the third tertile of PCB-118 had an adjusted 
hazard ratio (HR) of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.12, 3.23). For HCB the HR for the third 
versus the first tertile of maternal concentration was 1.92 (95% CI: 1.15, 
3.21). Weak positive associations were also estimated for PCB-156 and the 
non-dioxin-like PCBs (PCBs 138, 153, 170, 180). No associations were found for 
p,p´-DDE.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal concentrations of PCB-118 and HCB were associated with 
increased risk of asthma in offspring followed through 20 years of age.
