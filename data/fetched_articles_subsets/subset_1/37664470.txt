BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the largest global health 
emergencies of the 21st century. In recent years, its connection with 
environmental pollutants, such as bisphenol A (BPA), has been demonstrated; 
consequently, new structurally similar molecules are used to replace BPA in the 
plastics industry (BPS, BPF and BPAF).
AIM: To carry out a systematic review to allow coherent evaluation of the state 
of the art. Subsequently, a meta-analysis was performed to unify the existing 
quantitative data.
METHODS: Firstly, a systematic review was carried out, using the terms 
"(bisphenol) AND (Diabetes OR Hyperglycemia)", to maximize the number of 
results. Subsequently, three authors analyzed the set of articles. Finally, a 
meta-analysis was performed for each BP, using RevMan software. In addition, 
funnel plots were developed to study publication bias.
RESULTS: The systematic analysis of the literature revealed 13 recent articles 
(2017-2023) related to the study paradigm. The qualitative analysis showed 
interesting data linking diabetes to the three most widely used substitute BPs 
in the industry: BPS, BPF and BPAF. Finally, the meta-analysis determined a 
positive relationship with BPS, BPF and BPAF, which was only statistically 
significant with BPS.
CONCLUSION: There is a need to apply the precautionary principle, regulating the 
use of new BPs. Therefore, replacing BPA with BPS, BPF or BPAF is unlikely to 
protect the population from potential health risks, such as DM.
