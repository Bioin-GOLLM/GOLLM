Plasma fetuin-A is associated with type 2 diabetes, and AHSG, the gene encoding 
fetuin-A, has been identified as a susceptibility locus for diabetes and 
metabolic syndrome. Thus far, unbiased investigations of the genetic 
determinants of plasma fetuin-A concentrations have not been conducted. We 
searched for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to fetuin-A 
concentrations by a genome-wide association study in six population-based 
studies. We examined the association of fetuin-A levels with ∼ 2.5 million 
genotyped and imputed SNPs in 9,055 participants of European descent and 2,119 
African Americans. In both ethnicities, the strongest associations were centered 
in a region with a high degree of LD near the AHSG locus. Among 136 genome-wide 
significant (P < 0.05 × 10-8) SNPs near the AHSG locus, the top SNP was rs4917 
(P =1.27 × 10-303), a known coding SNP in exon 6 that is associated with a 
0.06 g/l (∼13%) lower fetuin-A level. This variant alone explained 14% of the 
variation in fetuin-A levels. Analyses conditioned on rs4917 indicated that the 
strong association with the AHSG locus stems from additional independent 
associations of multiple variants among European Americans. In conclusion, 
levels of fetuin-A in plasma are strongly associated with SNPs in its encoding 
gene, AHSG, but not elsewhere in the genome. Given the strength of the 
associations observed for multiple independent SNPs, the AHSG gene is an example 
of a candidate locus suitable for additional investigations including fine 
mapping to elucidate the biological basis of the findings and further functional 
experiments to clarify AHSG as a potential therapeutic target.
