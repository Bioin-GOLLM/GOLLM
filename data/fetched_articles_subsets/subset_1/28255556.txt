As a pathological condition, epilepsy is caused by abnormal neuronal discharge 
in brain which will temporarily disrupt the cerebral functions. Epilepsy is a 
chronic disease which occurs in all ages and would seriously affect patients' 
personal lives. Thus, it is highly required to develop effective medicines or 
instruments to treat the disease. Identifying epilepsy-related genes is 
essential in order to understand and treat the disease because the corresponding 
proteins encoded by the epilepsy-related genes are candidates of the potential 
drug targets. In this study, a pioneering computational workflow was proposed to 
predict novel epilepsy-related genes using the random walk with restart (RWR) 
algorithm. As reported in the literature RWR algorithm often produces a number 
of false positive genes, and in this study a permutation test and functional 
association tests were implemented to filter the genes identified by RWR 
algorithm, which greatly reduce the number of suspected genes and result in only 
thirty-three novel epilepsy genes. Finally, these novel genes were analyzed 
based upon some recently published literatures. Our findings implicate that all 
novel genes were closely related to epilepsy. It is believed that the proposed 
workflow can also be applied to identify genes related to other diseases and 
deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of these diseases.
