Background: Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 has been previously reported in the 
carcinogenesis of several tumors, and its potential functional polymorphisms 
have also been investigated in various diseases. However, the relationship 
between these polymorphisms and the susceptibility of thyroid cancer has still 
been largely unknown. In the present study, we aimed to explore the association 
between MALAT1 polymorphisms and thyroid cancer (TC) susceptibility, as well as 
potential biological function in TC. Methods: We conducted a case-control study 
with 1134 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients and 1228 controls to evaluate 
the potential correlation between MALAT1 genetic variations (single nucleotide 
polymorphism, SNP) and the risk of PTC. More detailed molecular mechanisms were 
explored by luciferase assay, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), and flow cytometry. 
Results: MALAT1 SNP rs619586 was identified as a significantly protective factor 
of PTC susceptibility (P = 0.017, OR= 0.76, 95%CI = 0.60-0.95). Further 
functional experiments of rs619586 indicated that G allele of rs619586 could 
significantly decrease MALAT1expression, reduce PTC proliferation, and directly 
increase PTC apoptosis. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that MALAT1 SNP 
rs619586 could serve as a potential indicator for PTC susceptibility and 
pathogenesis.
