The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is assembled into nucleo-protein structures 
termed nucleoids and maintained differently compared to nuclear DNA, the 
involved molecular basis remaining poorly understood. In yeast (Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae), mtDNA is a ∼80 kbp linear molecule and Abf2p, a double HMG-box 
protein, packages and maintains it. The protein binds DNA in a 
non-sequence-specific manner, but displays a distinct 'phased-binding' at 
specific DNA sequences containing poly-adenine tracts (A-tracts). We present 
here two crystal structures of Abf2p in complex with mtDNA-derived fragments 
bearing A-tracts. Each HMG-box of Abf2p induces a 90° bend in the contacted DNA, 
causing an overall U-turn. Together with previous data, this suggests that 
U-turn formation is the universal mechanism underlying mtDNA compaction induced 
by HMG-box proteins. Combining this structural information with mutational, 
biophysical and computational analyses, we reveal a unique DNA binding mechanism 
for Abf2p where a characteristic N-terminal flag and helix are crucial for mtDNA 
maintenance. Additionally, we provide the molecular basis for A-tract mediated 
exclusion of Abf2p binding. Due to high prevalence of A-tracts in yeast mtDNA, 
this has critical relevance for nucleoid architecture. Therefore, an 
unprecedented A-tract mediated protein positioning mechanism regulates DNA 
packaging proteins in the mitochondria, and in combination with DNA-bending and 
U-turn formation, governs mtDNA compaction.
