BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a debilitating hereditary 
disease characterized by alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) deficiency and consequent 
inability to degrade glycosaminoglycans. The pathological accumulation of 
glycosaminoglycans systemically results in severe mental retardation and 
multiple organ dysfunction. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human 
alpha-L-iduronidase (rhIDU) improves the function of some organs but not 
neurological deficits owing to its exclusion from the brain by the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB).
METHODS: We divided MPS I mice into control group, enzyme replacement group with 
rhIDU 2.9 mg/kg injection, enzyme replacement with one-spot ultrasound treatment 
group, and enzyme replacement with two-spot ultrasound treatment group, and 
compare treatment effectiveness between groups. All ultrasound treatments were 
applied on left side brain. Evans blue was used to simulate the distribution of 
rhIDU in the brain.
RESULTS: Transcranial pulsed weakly focused ultrasound combined with 
microbubbles facilitates brain rhIDU delivery in MPS I mice receiving systemic 
enzyme replacement therapy. With intravenously injected rhIDU 2.9 mg/kg, the 
IDUA enzyme activity on the ultrasound treated side of the cerebral hemisphere 
raised to 7.81-fold that on the untreated side and to 75.84% of its normal 
value. Evans blue simulation showed the distribution of the delivered drug was 
extensive, involving a large volume of the treated cerebral hemisphere. Two-spot 
ultrasound treatment scheme is more efficient for brain rhIDU delivery than 
one-spot ultrasound treatment scheme.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial pulsed weakly focused ultrasound can open BBB 
extensively and facilitates brain rhIDU delivery. This novel technology may 
provide a new MPS I treatment strategy.
