BACKGROUND: Because of the faltering sensitivity and/or specificity, urine-based 
assays currently have a limited role in the management of patients with bladder 
cancer. The aim of this study was to externally validate our previously reported 
protein biomarker panel from multiple sites in the United States and Europe.
METHODS: This multicenter external validation study included a total of 320 
subjects (bladder cancer = 183). The 10 biomarkers (IL8, MMP9, MMP10, SERPINA1, 
VEGFA, ANG, CA9, APOE, SDC1, and SERPINE1) were measured using commercial ELISA 
assays in an external laboratory. The diagnostic performance of the biomarker 
panel was assessed using receiver operator curves (ROC) and descriptive 
statistical values.
RESULTS: Utilizing the combination of all 10 biomarkers, the area under the ROC 
for the diagnostic panel was noted to be 0.847 (95% confidence interval, 
0.796-0.899), outperforming any single biomarker. The multiplex assay at optimal 
cutoff value achieved an overall sensitivity of 0.79, specificity of 0.79, 
positive prediction value of 0.73, and negative prediction value of 0.84 for 
bladder cancer classification. Sensitivity values of the diagnostic panel for 
high-grade bladder cancer, low-grade bladder cancer, muscle invasive bladder 
cancer, and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer were 0.81, 0.90, 0.95, and 0.77, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary levels of the biomarker panel enabled discrimination of 
patients with bladder cancer and controls, and the levels of biomarker subsets 
were associated with advancing tumor grade and stage.
IMPACT: If proven to be reliable, urinary diagnostic biomarker assays can detect 
bladder cancer in a timely manner such that the patient can expect improvements 
in overall survival and quality of life.
