Androgen receptor signaling fuels prostate cancer and is a major therapeutic 
target. However, mechanisms of resistance to therapeutic androgen ablation are 
not well understood. Here, using a prostate cancer mouse model, Pten(pc-/-), 
carrying a prostate epithelial-specific Pten deletion, we show that the αvβ6 
integrin is required for tumor growth in vivo of castrated as well as of 
noncastrated mice. We describe a novel signaling pathway that couples the αvβ6 
integrin cell surface receptor to androgen receptor via activation of JNK1 and 
causes increased nuclear localization and activity of androgen receptor. This 
downstream kinase activation by αvβ6 is specific for JNK1, with no involvement 
of p38 or ERK kinase. In addition, differential phosphorylation of Akt is not 
observed under these conditions, nor is cell morphology affected by αvβ6 
expression. This pathway, which is specific for αvβ6, because it is not 
regulated by a different αv-containing integrin, αvβ3, promotes upregulation of 
survivin, which in turn supports anchorage-independent growth of αvβ6-expressing 
cells. Consistently, both αvβ6 and survivin are significantly increased in 
prostatic adenocarcinoma, but are not detected in normal prostatic epithelium. 
Neither XIAP nor Bcl-2 is affected by αvβ6 expression. In conclusion, we show 
that αvβ6 expression is required for prostate cancer progression, including 
castrate-resistant prostate cancer; mechanistically, by promoting activation of 
JNK1, the αvβ6 integrin causes androgen receptor-increased activity in the 
absence of androgen and consequent upregulation of survivin. These preclinical 
results pave the way for further clinical development of αvβ6 antagonists for 
prostate cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 76(17); 5163-74. ©2016 AACR.
