Most macromolecular X-ray structures are determined from cryocooled crystals, 
but it is unclear whether cryocooling distorts functionally relevant 
flexibility. Here we compare independently acquired pairs of high-resolution 
data sets of a model Michaelis complex of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), 
collected by separate groups at both room and cryogenic temperatures. These data 
sets allow us to isolate the differences between experimental procedures and 
between temperatures. Our analyses of multiconformer models and time-averaged 
ensembles suggest that cryocooling suppresses and otherwise modifies side-chain 
and main-chain conformational heterogeneity, quenching dynamic contact networks. 
Despite some idiosyncratic differences, most changes from room temperature to 
cryogenic temperature are conserved and likely reflect temperature-dependent 
solvent remodeling. Both cryogenic data sets point to additional conformations 
not evident in the corresponding room temperature data sets, suggesting that 
cryocooling does not merely trap preexisting conformational heterogeneity. Our 
results demonstrate that crystal cryocooling consistently distorts the energy 
landscape of DHFR, a paragon for understanding functional protein dynamics.
