BACKGROUND: Heterozygous purinergic receptor p2x gene ( P2RX2) c.178G>T (p.V60L) 
mutations can lead to progressive hearing loss (HL) and increased susceptibility 
to noise. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A combination of 
human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology with clustered regularly 
interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 
(Cas)9-mediated gene editing may provide a promising tool to study gene function 
and treat hereditary deafness in humans.
METHODS: hiPSC technology and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing were used to 
generate heterozygous and homozygous P2RX2 c.178G>T (p.V60L) cell models.
RESULTS: We generated non-integrative hiPSCs from urine samples derived from 
three members of a large Chinese family carrying heterozygous P2RX2 c.178G>T 
mutations (designated P2RX2+/-) as a model to study P2RX2-mediated hereditary 
HL. Furthermore, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and single-stranded donor oligonucleotides 
to genetically establish homozygous P2RX2 c.178G>T hiPSCs (designated P2RX2-/-) 
from heterozygous patient-specific hiPSCs as a control to further study the 
pathological gene function.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous and homozygous P2RX2-mutated hiPSC lines are good 
models to investigate the pathological mechanisms of P2RX2 mutations in HL 
pathogenesis. Our findings confirmed our hypothesis that it is feasible and 
convenient to introduce precise point mutations into genomic loci of interest to 
generate gene-mutated hiPSC models.
