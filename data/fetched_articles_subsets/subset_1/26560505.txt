Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) of soft tissue is a sarcoma with smooth-muscle 
differentiation, and conventional chemotherapy does not improve its outcome. The 
application of novel antitumor agents and precise prognostication has been 
demanded. The expression of the protein Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), a member of the 
FOX family, is considered an independent predictor of poor survival in many 
cancers and sarcomas. However, the expression status of FOXM1 in LMS is poorly 
understood. The purposes of this study were to examine the correlation between 
the expression of FOXM1 and clinicopathologic or prognostic factors and to 
clarify the efficacy of FOXM1 target therapy in LMS. We evaluated the 
immunohistochemical expressions of FOXM1 using 123 LMS tumor specimens. 
Univariate and multivariate survival analyses revealed that FOXM1 expression was 
associated with poor prognosis in LMS. An in vitro study was then carried out to 
examine the antitumor effect of a FOXM1 inhibitor (thiostrepton) and siRNA on a 
novel LMS cell line, TC616. We also assessed the efficacy of the combined use of 
doxorubicin and thiostrepton. Thiostrepton showed dose-dependent antitumor 
activity and TC616 cells treated with the combination of thiostrepton and 
doxorubicin showed lower proliferation compared to those treated with either 
drug individually. FOXM1 interruption by siRNA decreased cell proliferation and 
increased chemosensitivity. In conclusion, FOXM1 has potential to be a 
therapeutic target for LMS.
