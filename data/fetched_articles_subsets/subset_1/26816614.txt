BACKGROUND: Translocated in LipoSarcoma (TLS, also known as FUsed in Sarcoma) is 
an RNA/DNA binding protein whose mutation cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
In previous study, we demonstrated that TLS binds to long noncoding RNA, 
promoter-associated ncRNA-D (pncRNA-D), transcribed from the 5' upstream region 
of cyclin D1 (CCND1), and inhibits the expression of CCND1.
RESULTS: In order to elucidate the binding specificity between TLS and pncRNA-D, 
we divided pncRNA-D into seven fragments and examined the binding with 
full-length TLS, TLS-RGG2-zinc finger-RGG3, and TLS-RGG3 by RNA pull down assay. 
As a result, TLS was able to bind to all the seven fragments, but the fragments 
containing reported recognition motifs (GGUG and GGU) tend to bind more solidly. 
The full-length TLS and TLS-RGG2-zinc finger-RGG3 showed a similar interaction 
with pncRNA-D, but the binding specificity of TLS-RGG3 was lower compared to the 
full-length TLS and TLS-RGG2-zinc finger-RGG3. Mutation in GGUG and GGU motifs 
dramatically decreased the binding, and unexpectedly, we could only detect weak 
interaction with the RNA sequence with stem loop structure.
CONCLUSION: The binding of TLS and pncRNA-D was affected by the presence of GGUG 
and GGU sequences, and the C terminal domains of TLS function in the interaction 
with pncRNA-D.
