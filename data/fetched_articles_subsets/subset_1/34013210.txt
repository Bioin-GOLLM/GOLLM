Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is used to study interactions between 
proteins and DNA. Nuclear lysates are prepared, and chromatin is fragmented by 
sonication. Antibodies are used to purify a protein of interest (e.g., a 
transcription factor or histone mark) along with any bound DNA. The genomic 
binding sites can then be mapped by sequencing the bound DNA (ChIP-seq) or by 
qPCR if binding sites are already known. ChIP requires optimization for each 
cell type, and success is highly antibody dependent. This protocol can be 
adapted to other cell lines with careful optimization. For complete details on 
the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Holliday et al. (2021).
