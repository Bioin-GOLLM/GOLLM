PURPOSE: To investigate the cause of recurrent central retinal vein occlusion in 
a 26-year-old white woman.
METHODS: Case report. Complete blood analyses were done, including HLA tissue 
typing, immunoserologic and coagulation tests, with cardiovascular and 
capillaroscopy investigations. Factor V:R506Q and prothrombin 20210 GIA 
mutations were checked by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme 
analysis.
RESULTS: DNA analysis showed the patient to be heterozygous for factor V:R506Q 
mutation. During a follow-up of 18-months, after starting anticoagulant therapy, 
the patient had not suffered from any other ocular or systemic occlusive 
vascular accident.
CONCLUSIONS: The R506Q factor V gene mutation may be associated with recurrent 
central retinal vein occlusions. Genetic investigation should be promptly 
recommended in thrombotic patients to establish a specific preventive treatment.
