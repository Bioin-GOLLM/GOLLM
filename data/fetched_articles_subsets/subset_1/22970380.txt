Coffee is one of the most important plantation crops, grown in about 80 
countries across the world. The genus Coffea comprises approximately 100 species 
of which only two species, that is, Coffea arabica (commonly known as arabica 
coffee) and Coffea canephora (known as robusta coffee), are commercially 
cultivated. Genetic improvement of coffee through traditional breeding is slow 
due to the perennial nature of the plant. Genetic transformation has tremendous 
potential in developing improved coffee varieties with desired agronomic traits, 
which are otherwise difficult to achieve through traditional breeding. During 
the last twenty years, significant progress has been made in coffee 
biotechnology, particularly in the area of transgenic technology. This paper 
provides a detailed account of the advances made in the genetic transformation 
of coffee and their potential applications.
