Deposition of misfolded proteins and synaptic failure affects the brain in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its progression results in amnesia and cognitive 
impairment. Absence of treatment is due to excessive loss of neurons in the 
patients and the delayed effects of drugs. The enhanced pluripotency, 
proliferation, differentiation, and recombination characteristics of stromal 
cells into nerve cells and glial cells present them as a potential treatment for 
AD. Successful evidence of action in animal models along with positive results 
in preclinical studies further encourage its utilization for AD treatment. With 
regard to humans, cell replacement therapy involving mesenchymal stromal cells, 
induced-pluripotent stromal cells, human embryonic stromal cells, and neural 
stems show promising results in clinical trials. However, further research is 
required prior to its use as stromal cell therapy in AD related disorders. The 
current review deals with the mechanism of development of anomalies such as 
Alzheimer's and the prospective applications of stromal cells for treatment.
