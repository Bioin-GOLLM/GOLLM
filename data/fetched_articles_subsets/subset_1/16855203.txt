BACKGROUND: Guanidinoactetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency is an 
autosomal recessive disorder of creatine synthesis. The authors analyzed 
clinical, biochemical, and molecular findings in 27 patients.
METHODS: The authors collected data from questionnaires and literature reports. 
A score including degree of intellectual disability, epileptic seizures, and 
movement disorder was developed and used to classify clinical phenotype as 
severe, moderate, or mild. Score and biochemical data were assessed before and 
during treatment with oral creatine substitution alone or with additional 
dietary arginine restriction and ornithine supplementation.
RESULTS: Intellectual disability, epileptic seizures, guanidinoacetate 
accumulation in body fluids, and deficiency of brain creatine were common in all 
27 patients. Twelve patients had severe, 12 patients had moderate, and three 
patients had mild clinical phenotype. Twenty-one of 27 (78%) patients had severe 
intellectual disability (estimated IQ 20 to 34). There was no obvious 
correlation between severity of the clinical phenotype, guanidinoacetate 
accumulation in body fluids, and GAMT mutations. Treatment resulted in almost 
normalized cerebral creatine levels, reduced guanidinoacetate accumulation, and 
in improvement of epilepsy and movement disorder, whereas the degree of 
intellectual disability remained unchanged.
CONCLUSION: Guanidinoactetate methyltransferase deficiency should be considered 
in patients with unexplained intellectual disability, and urinary 
guanidinoacetate should be determined as an initial diagnostic approach.
