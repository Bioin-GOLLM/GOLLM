Metastasis frequently develops from disseminated cancer cells that remain 
dormant after the apparently successful treatment of a primary tumour. These 
cells fluctuate between an immune-evasive quiescent state and a proliferative 
state liable to immune-mediated elimination1-6. Little is known about the 
clearing of reawakened metastatic cells and how this process could be 
therapeutically activated to eliminate residual disease in patients. Here we use 
models of indolent lung adenocarcinoma metastasis to identify cancer 
cell-intrinsic determinants of immune reactivity during exit from dormancy. 
Genetic screens of tumour-intrinsic immune regulators identified the stimulator 
of interferon genes (STING) pathway as a suppressor of metastatic outbreak. 
STING activity increases in metastatic progenitors that re-enter the cell cycle 
and is dampened by hypermethylation of the STING promoter and enhancer in 
breakthrough metastases or by chromatin repression in cells re-entering dormancy 
in response to TGFβ. STING expression in cancer cells derived from spontaneous 
metastases suppresses their outgrowth. Systemic treatment of mice with STING 
agonists eliminates dormant metastasis and prevents spontaneous outbreaks in a T 
cell- and natural killer cell-dependent manner-these effects require cancer cell 
STING function. Thus, STING provides a checkpoint against the progression of 
dormant metastasis and a therapeutically actionable strategy for the prevention 
of disease relapse.
