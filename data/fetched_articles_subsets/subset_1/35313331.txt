WNT signaling promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) through diverse 
effects on proliferation, differentiation, survival, and stemness. A subset of 
PDAC with inactivating mutations in ring finger protein 43 (RNF43) show growth 
dependency on autocrine WNT ligand signaling and are susceptible to agents that 
block WNT ligand acylation by Porcupine O-acyltransferase, which is required for 
proper WNT ligand processing and secretion. For this study, global 
transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses were performed to explore 
the therapeutic response of RNF43-mutant PDAC to the Porcupine inhibitor 
(PORCNi) LGK974. LGK974 disrupted cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial 
function through actions that included rapid mitochondrial depolarization, 
reduced mitochondrial content, and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and 
tricarboxylic acid cycle. LGK974 also broadly altered transcriptional activity, 
downregulating genes involved in cell cycle, nucleotide metabolism, and 
ribosomal biogenesis and upregulating genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition, hypoxia, endocytosis, and lysosomes. Autophagy and lysosomal 
activity were augmented in response to LGK974, which synergistically inhibited 
tumor cell viability in combination with chloroquine. Autocrine WNT ligand 
signaling dictates metabolic dependencies in RNF43-mutant PDAC through a 
combination of transcription dependent and independent effects linked to 
mitochondrial health and function. Metabolic adaptations to mitochondrial damage 
and bioenergetic stress represent potential targetable liabilities in 
combination with PORCNi for the treatment of WNT ligand-addicted PDAC.
