Cercospora leaf blight (CLB) of soybean, caused by Cercospora cf. flagellaris, 
C. kikuchii, and C. cf. sigesbeckiae, is an economically important disease in 
the southern United States. Cultivar resistance to CLB is inconsistent; 
therefore, fungicides in the quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) class have been 
relied on to manage the disease. Approximately 620 isolates from plants 
exhibiting CLB were collected between 2018 and 2021 from 19 locations in eight 
southern states. A novel polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay based on two genes, calmodulin and histone h3, was 
developed to differentiate between the dominant species of Cercospora, C. cf. 
flagellaris, and C. cf. sigesbeckiae. A multilocus phylogenetic analysis of 
actin, calmodulin, histone h3, ITS rDNA, and transcription elongation factor 1-Î± 
was used to confirm PCR-RFLP results and identify remaining isolates. 
Approximately 80% of the isolates collected were identified as C. cf. 
flagellaris, while 15% classified as C. cf. sigesbeckiae, 2% as C. kikuchii, and 
3% as previously unreported Cercospora species associated with CLB in the United 
States. PCR-RFLP of cytochrome b (cytb) identified QoI-resistance conferred by 
the G143A substitution. Approximately 64 to 83% of isolates were determined to 
be QoI-resistant, and all contained the G143A substitution. Results of 
discriminatory dose assays using azoxystrobin (1 ppm) were 100% consistent with 
PCR-RFLP results. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of QoI 
resistance in CLB pathogen populations from Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, 
Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Texas. In areas where high frequencies of 
resistance have been identified, QoI fungicides should be avoided, and fungicide 
products with alternative modes-of-action should be utilized in the absence of 
CLB-resistant soybean cultivars.
