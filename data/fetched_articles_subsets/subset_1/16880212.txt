In fission yeast, the replication checkpoint is enforced by the kinase Cds1 
(human Chk2), which regulates both cell cycle progression and DNA repair factors 
to ensure that the genome is faithfully duplicated prior to mitosis. Cds1 
contains a forkhead-associated domain that mediates its interaction with 
phosphorylated residues in target proteins. One target of Cds1 is the essential 
nuclear protein Rad60, which contains the unique structural feature of tandem 
SUMO homology domains at its C terminus. Hypomorphic mutants of Rad60 cause 
profound defects in DNA repair and replication stress tolerance. To explore the 
physiological significance of the Cds1-Rad60 interaction, we have examined the 
phosphorylation of Rad60 by Cds1 in vitro and the in vivo phosphorylation of 
Rad60 in response to replication blocks. We find that the N terminus but not the 
SUMO-like domain of Rad60 is phosphorylated in both conditions. Three important 
Rad60 phosphorylation sites were identified: Thr(72), Ser(32), and Ser(34). 
Rad60 Thr(72) mediates the Cds1-Rad60 interaction and is required for the 
Cds1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad60 in response to replication arrest. 
Phosphorylation of Rad60 Ser(32) and Ser(34) in a putative SUMO-binding motif is 
critical for the survival of replication stress. In addition, mutation of Rad60 
Ser(32) and Ser(34) to alanine is lethal in cells deleted for the RecQ DNA 
helicase Rqh1. Finally, we find that Rad60 self-associates via its C-terminal 
SUMO-like domain and putative SUMO-binding motifs.
