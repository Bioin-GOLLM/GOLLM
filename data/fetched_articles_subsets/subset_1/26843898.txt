BACKGROUND: Mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2 genes are well-established 
risk factors for the development of breast and/or ovarian cancer. The frequency 
and spectrum of mutations in these genes has not yet been examined in the 
population of Southern Poland.
METHODS: We examined the entire coding sequences of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes 
and genotyped a recurrent mutation of the PALB2 gene (c.509_510delGA) in 121 
women with familial and/or early-onset breast or ovarian cancer from Southern 
Poland.
RESULTS: A BRCA1 mutation was identified in 11 of 121 patients (9.1 %) and a 
BRCA2 mutation was identified in 10 of 121 patients (8.3 %). Two founder 
mutations of BRCA1 accounted for 91 % of all BRCA1 mutation carriers (c.5266dupC 
was identified in six patients and c.181 T > G was identified in four patients). 
Three of the seven different BRCA2 mutations were detected in two patients each 
(c.9371A > T, c.9403delC and c.1310_1313delAAGA). Three mutations have not been 
previously reported in the Polish population (BRCA1 c.3531delT, BRCA2 
c.1310_1313delAAGA and BRCA2 c.9027delT). The recurrent PALB2 mutation 
c.509_510delGA was identified in two patients (1.7 %).
CONCLUSIONS: The standard panel of BRCA1 founder mutations is sufficiently 
sensitive for the identification of BRCA1 mutation carriers in Southern Poland. 
The BRCA2 mutations c.9371A > T and c.9403delC as well as the PALB2 mutation 
c.509_510delGA should be included in the testing panel for this population.
