We report a case of genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (gCJD), which has a 
clinical phenotype that is highly similar to Fatal Family Insomnia (FFI) and has 
a triad of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKs) at the developmental stage of the 
disease. The 51-year-old male complained of sleep disorder and imbalance who had 
visited five different hospitals before diagnosed. A neurological examination 
revealed a triad of symptoms characteristic for WKs such as gaze paresis, ataxia 
of limbs and trunk, and memory disturbances. The disturbances increased during 
the course of the disease, which led to the death of the patient 18Â months after 
the appearance of the signs. Although the patient show negative in brain 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 14-3-3 protein of cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF), he was finally diagnosed with gCJD disease by the human prion protein 
(PRNP) gene mutations.
