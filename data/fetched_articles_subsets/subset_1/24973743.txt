Advances in genomics and next-generation sequencing have provided clinical 
researchers with unprecedented opportunities to understand the molecular basis 
of human genetic disorders. This abundance of information places new 
requirements on traditional disease models, which have the potential to be used 
to confirm newly identified pathogenic mutations and test the efficacy of 
emerging therapies. The unique attributes of zebrafish are being increasingly 
leveraged to create functional disease models, facilitate drug discovery, and 
provide critical scientific bases for the development of new clinical tools for 
the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. In this short review and the 
accompanying poster, we highlight a few illustrative examples of the 
applications of the zebrafish model to the study of human health and disease.
