Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder 
characterized by abnormalities involving the skin, brain, kidney 
(angiomyolipomas, cysts), and heart. Horseshoe kidney has not been considered to 
be a common renal manifestation of TSC but it has been previously reported in 
two patients with TSC. We report on two unrelated females with typical 
manifestations of TSC, horseshoe kidney, and an identical variant c.5138G>A in 
exon 39 (p.Arg1713His) of TSC2 gene. These cases provide evidence that horseshoe 
kidney is associated with TSC and add to the evidence for the pathogenicity of 
this variant. Furthermore, one of the patients also had a diaphragmatic hernia 
which has been reported twice in the medical literature in individuals with TSC. 
It is possible that a diaphragmatic hernia is another rare manifestation of TSC 
and that TSC should be included in the differential diagnosis of infants with a 
diaphragmatic hernia. Given that both a horseshoe kidney and a diaphragmatic 
hernia are findings that can be detected prenatally on an ultrasound 
examination, our findings may have implications for prenatal genetic counseling.
