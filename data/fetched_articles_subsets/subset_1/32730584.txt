Anti-tumour-analgesic peptide (AGAP), one scorpion toxin purified from Buthus 
martensii Karsch, was known as its analgesic and anti-tumour activities. Trp38, 
a conserved aromatic residue of AGAP, might play important roles in its 
interaction with sodium channels. In this study, a mutant W38F was generated and 
effects of W38F were examined on hNav1.4, hNav1.5 and hNav1.7 by using 
whole-cell patch-clamp, which were closely associated to the biotoxicity of 
skeletal and cardiac muscles and pain signalling. The data showed that W38F 
decreased the inhibition effects of peak currents of hNav1.7, hNav1.4 and 
hNav1.5 compared with AGAP, notably, W38F reduced the analgesic activity 
compared with AGAP. The results suggested that Trp38 be a crucial amino acid 
involved in the interaction with these three sodium channels. The decreased 
analgesic activity of W38F might result from its much less inhibition of 
hNav1.7. These findings provided more information about the relationship between 
structure and function of AGAP and may facilitate the modification of other 
scorpion toxins with pharmacological effects.
