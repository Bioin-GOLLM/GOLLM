BACKGROUND: Neuraxial labor analgesia is known to increase the rate of 
instrumental delivery and prolong the second stage of labor; however, there is 
no standard method to evaluate the progress of labor under analgesia. Friedman 
curve is considered the gold standard for evaluating the progress of labor. 
However, it included not only neuraxial labor analgesia but also labor without 
analgesia. Thus we compared the labor curves of primiparous women undergoing 
labor with and without neuraxial labor analgesia, to understand the progress of 
labor in both groups and to arrive at a standard curve to monitor the progress 
of labor under neuraxial analgesia.
METHODS: Primiparous women with cephalic singleton pregnancies who delivered at 
term from 2016 to 2017 were included. Two hundred patients who opted for 
combined spinal-epidural (CSE) labor analgesia were included in the CSE group 
and 200 patients who did not undergo CSE were included in the non-CSE group. In 
all, 400 cases were examined retrospectively. The evaluation parameters were 
cervical dilation and fetal station, and we calculated the average value per 
hour to plot the labor curves.
RESULTS: The labor curve of the non-CSE group was significantly different from 
the Friedman curve. In the CSE group, the time from 4 cm dilation of the cervix 
to full dilation was 15 h; in addition, the speed of cervical dilation was 
different from that in the non-CSE group. The progress of labor in the CSE group 
was faster than that in the non-CSE group during the latent phase; however, the 
progress in the CSE group was slower than that in the non-CSE group during the 
active phase.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuraxial labor analgesia results in early cervical dilation and 
descent of the fetal head; thus, appropriate advance planning to manage the 
delivery may be essential.
