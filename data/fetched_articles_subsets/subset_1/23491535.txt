T lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) display a 
complex array of cellular, molecular, and signaling anomalies, many of which 
have been attributed to increased expression of the transcriptional regulator 
cAMP responsive element modulator α (CREMα). Recent evidence indicates that 
CREMα, in addition to its regulatory functions on gene promoters in T 
lymphocytes, alters the epigenetic conformation of cytokine genes by interacting 
with enzymes that control histone methylation and acetylation as well as 
cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) DNA methylation. This review summarizes the 
most recent findings on CREM protein expression in various cell types, in 
particular its effects on T lymphocyte biology in the context of both health and 
SLE. We emphasize CREMα as a key molecule that drives autoimmunity.
