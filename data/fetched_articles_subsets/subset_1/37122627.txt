MicroRNA (miRNA) dysregulation is well-documented in psychiatric disease, but 
miRNA dynamics remain poorly understood during adolescent and early adult brain 
maturation, when symptoms often first appear. Here, we use RNA sequencing to 
examine miRNAs and their mRNA targets in cortex and hippocampus from early-, 
mid-, and late-adolescent and adult mice. Furthermore, we use quantitative 
proteomics by tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) to examine protein 
dynamics in cortex from the same subjects. We found that ~25% of miRNAs' 3' ends 
shorten with age due to increased 3' trimming and decreased U tailing. 
Particularly, shorter but functionally competent isoforms (isomiRs) of 
miR-338-3p increase up to 10-fold during adolescence and only in brain. MiRNAs 
that undergo 3' shortening exhibit stronger negative correlations with targets 
that decrease with age and stronger positive correlations with targets that 
increase with age, than miRNAs with stable 3' ends. Increased 3' shortening with 
age was also observed in available mouse and human miRNA-seq data sets, and 
stronger correlations between miRNAs that undergo shortening and their mRNA 
targets were observed in two of the three available data sets. We conclude that 
age-associated miRNA 3' shortening is a well-conserved feature of postnatal 
brain maturation.
