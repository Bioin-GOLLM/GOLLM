A new method for the detection of unknown mutations, enhanced mismatch mutation 
analysis (EMMA), is proposed. It is based on electrophoretic heteroduplex 
analysis (HDA). The resolution is considerably improved, thanks to the 
combination of high-resolution block-copolymer sieving matrix, and nucleosides 
as additives in the electrophoretic medium. The EMMA method is compared to 
denaturing HPLC (DHPLC) in a large-scale study of mutations in the breast 
cancer-associated gene BRCA2, involving 4655 DNA amplicons from 94 patients. The 
rate of false positives was 0.09%. The raw success rate, without optimization of 
the amplicons tiling, was 94%, a value much higher than that achieved earlier 
with HDA, and comparable with that obtained with DHPLC. An analysis of the 
missed mutations suggest that the success rate could be improved up to about 
97%, simply by redesigning the amplicons, while retaining the speed, cost 
effectiveness, and simplicity of the method.
