Double strand conformation polymorphism (DSCP) detects two point mutations at 
codon 280 (AAC-->ATC) and at codon 431 (TAC-->AAC) of the blood coagulation 
factor VIII gene.

Hemophilia A is a hereditary, X-linked, bleeding disorder that is caused by a 
defect in the factor VIII gene. Here, we report two novel point mutations in the 
factor VIII gene that result in an aberrant electrophoretic mobility of double 
strand PCR fragments (double strand conformation polymorphism, DSCP). In exon 9 
a TAC-->AAC mutation at codon 431, replacing Tyr by Asn, was observed in a 
family (A211) with moderately severe hemophilia A. A family with mild hemophilia 
A revealed an A-->T mutation in codon 280 (exon 7) that results in the 
replacement of Asn by Ile. One of these two mutations was not detected in an 
analysis based on single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP). At present we 
have no explanation for the effect of the nucleotide changes on the 
electrophoretic mobility of double strand DNA. Although DSCP is not able to 
detect all mutations the combination of DSCP analysis with SSCP analysis 
increases the sensitivity in a screening for factor VIII mutations.
