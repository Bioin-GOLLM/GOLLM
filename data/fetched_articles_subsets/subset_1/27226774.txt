BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a frequent echocardiographic 
feature in Fabry disease (FD) and in severe cases may be confused with 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) of other origin. The prevalence of FD in 
patients primarily diagnosed with HCM varies considerably in screening and case 
finding studies, respectively. In a significant proportion of patients, 
presenting with only mild or moderate LVH and unspecific clinical signs FD may 
remain undiagnosed. Urinary Gb3 isoforms have been shown to detect FD in both, 
women and men. We examined whether this non-invasive method would help to 
identify new FD cases in a non-selected cohort of patients with various degree 
of LVH.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients older than 18 years with a diastolic 
interventricular septal wall thickness of ≥12mm determined by echocardiography 
were included. Referral diagnosis was documented and spot urine was collected. 
Gb3 was measured by mass spectroscopy. Subjects with an elevated Gb3-24:18 ratio 
were clinically examined for signs of FD, α-galactosidase-A activity in 
leukocytes was determined and GLA-mutation-analysis was performed. We examined 
2596 patients. In 99 subjects urinary Gb3 isoforms excretion were elevated. In 
these patients no new cases of FD were identified by extended FD assessment. In 
two of three patients formerly diagnosed with FD Gb3-24:18 ratio was elevated 
and would have led to further diagnostic evaluation.
CONCLUSION: Measurement of urinary Gb3 isoforms in a non-selected cohort with 
LVH was unable to identify new cases of FD. False positive results may be 
prevented by more restricted inclusion criteria and may improve diagnostic 
accuracy of this method.
