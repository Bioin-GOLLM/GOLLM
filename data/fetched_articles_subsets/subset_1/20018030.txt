After performing a genome-wide association study, it is often difficult to know 
which regions to follow up, especially when no one marker reaches genome-wide 
significance. Researchers frequently focus on their top N findings, knowing that 
true associations may be buried deeper in the list. Others focus on genes or 
regions that have multiple markers showing evidence of association. However, 
these markers are often in high linkage disequilibrium with one another (r2 > 
0.80), which indicates that these additional markers are providing redundant 
information. I propose a novel method that identifies regions with multiple 
lines of evidence, by down-weighting the contribution of additional markers in 
proportion to pairwise linkage disequilibrium. I have used this non-redundant 
summary score in my analysis of the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Consortium dataset released as part of Genetic Analysis Workshop 16. Three 
regions were identified that had a genome-wide empirical p-value less than 0.01, 
including one novel region on chromosome 20 near the KCNB1 and PTGIS genes.
