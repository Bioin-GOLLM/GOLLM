INTRODUCTION: This study is to investigate the effect of late-onset hemorrhagic 
cystitis (LOHC) on progression-free survival (PFS) of patients after 
haploidentical peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(haplo-PBSCT).
METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 74 patients with hematological 
malignancies treated with a myeloablative conditioning regimen and haplo-PBSCT. 
The effect of LOHC on PFS was studied in terms of HC occurrence, grade, disease 
type, duration, onset time, gender, and age.
RESULTS: There were 28 patients with LOHC, and no case was with early-onset HC. 
The cumulative incidence of LOHC was 37.8% (95% CI: 26.9-48.7%). The 2-year 
expected PFS of 74 patients and 34 AML patients was not significantly different 
between LOHC patients and patients without HC (P > 0.05). Among 27 ALL patients, 
the 2-year expected PFS of LOHC patients was 75%, significantly higher than 
patients without HC (54.2%) (P < 0.05). The 2-year expected PFSs of patients 
with mild LOHC and severe LOHC were 69.8 and 77.8%, respectively (P > 0.05). 
Similarly, the onset time, duration, age, and gender of LOHC patients did not 
show significant effects on PFS (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: After haplo-PBSCT, LOHC has a significant effect on the PFS of ALL 
patients. The HC grade, duration, onset time, gender, and age have no 
significant effect on PFS.
