BACKGROUND: Common genetic variation and rare mutations in genes encoding 
calcium channel subunits have pleiotropic effects on risk for multiple 
neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 
schizophrenia. To gain further mechanistic insights by extending previous gene 
expression data, we constructed co-expression networks in Timothy syndrome (TS), 
a monogenic condition with high penetrance for ASD, caused by mutations in the 
L-type calcium channel, Cav1.2.
METHODS: To identify patient-specific alterations in transcriptome organization, 
we conducted a genome-wide weighted co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on 
neural progenitors and neurons from multiple lines of induced pluripotent stem 
cells (iPSC) derived from normal and TS (G406R in CACNA1C) individuals. We 
employed transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis to assess whether 
TS associated co-expression changes reflect calcium-dependent co-regulation.
RESULTS: We identified reproducible developmental and activity-dependent gene 
co-expression modules conserved in patient and control cell lines. By comparing 
cell lines from case and control subjects, we also identified co-expression 
modules reflecting distinct aspects of TS, including intellectual disability and 
ASD-related phenotypes. Moreover, by integrating co-expression with 
transcription factor binding analysis, we showed the TS-associated 
transcriptional changes were predicted to be co-regulated by calcium-dependent 
transcriptional regulators, including NFAT, MEF2, CREB, and FOXO, thus providing 
a mechanism by which altered Ca(2+) signaling in TS patients leads to the 
observed molecular dysregulation.
CONCLUSIONS: We applied WGCNA to construct co-expression networks related to 
neural development and depolarization in iPSC-derived neural cells from TS and 
control individuals for the first time. These analyses illustrate how a systems 
biology approach based on gene networks can yield insights into the molecular 
mechanisms of neural development and function, and provide clues as to the 
functional impact of the downstream effects of Ca(2+) signaling dysregulation on 
transcription.
