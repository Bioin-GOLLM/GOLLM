Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to identify the variants responsible 
for inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) in a Caucasian family. Segregation 
analysis of selected rare variants with pathogenic potential identified a set of 
compound heterozygous changes p.Arg266*:c.796C>T and p.Ala568Thr:c.1702G>A in 
the intraflagellar transport protein-88 (IFT88) gene segregating with IRD. 
Expression of IFT88 with the p.Arg266* and p.Ala568Thr mutations in mIMDC3 cells 
by transient transfection and in HeLa cells by introducing the mutations using 
CRISPR-cas9 system suggested that both mutations result in the formation of 
abnormal ciliary structures. The introduction of the IFT88 p.Arg266* variant in 
the homozygous state in HeLa cells by CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing revealed that 
the mutant transcript undergoes nonsense-mediated decay leading to a significant 
depletion of IFT88 transcript. Additionally, abnormal ciliogenesis was observed 
in these cells. These observations suggest that the rare and unique combination 
of IFT88 alleles observed in this study provide insight into the physiological 
role of IFT88 in humans and the likely mechanism underlying retinal pathology in 
the pedigree with IRD.
