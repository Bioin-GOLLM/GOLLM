The mRNA vaccine technology was developed rapidly during the global pandemic of 
COVID-19. The crucial role of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in preventing viral 
infection also have been beneficial to the exploration and application of other 
viral mRNA vaccines, especially for non-replication structure mRNA vaccines of 
viral disease with outstanding research results. Therefore, this review pays 
attention to the existing mRNA vaccines, which are of great value for candidates 
for clinical applications in viral diseases. We provide an overview of the 
optimization of the mRNA vaccine development process as well as the good immune 
efficacy and safety shown in clinical studies. In addition, we also provide a 
brief description of the important role of mRNA immunomodulators in the 
treatment of viral diseases. After that, it will provide a good reference or 
strategy for research on mRNA vaccines used in clinical medicine with more 
stable structures, higher translation efficiency, better immune efficacy and 
safety, shorter production time, and lower production costs than conditional 
vaccines to be used as preventive or therapeutic strategy for the control of 
viral diseases in the future.
