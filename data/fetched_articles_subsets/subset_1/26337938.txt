Relative little is known about the functions of the so-called Dof zinc factors 
in plants. Here we report on the analysis of OsDof25 and show a function in 
regulation of the important C4 photosynthesis gene, OsC4PPDK in rice. 
Over-expression of OsDof25 enhanced the expression of OsC4PPDK in transient 
expression experiments by binding in a specific way to a conserved Dof binding 
site which was confirmed by yeast and in vitro binding studies. Expression 
studies using promoter GUS plants as well as qPCR experiments showed that 
OsDof25 expressed in different tissues including both photosynthetic and 
non-photosynthetic organs and that expression of OsDof25 was partially 
overlapping with the OsC4PPDK gene. Conclusive evidence for a role of OsDof25 in 
regulation of C4PPDK came from loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments 
with transgenic rice, which showed that down-regulation or over-expression of 
OsDof25 correlated with OsC4PPDK expression and that OsDof25 has functions as 
transcriptional activator.
