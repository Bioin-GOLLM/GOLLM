Cancer cells express high levels of PD-L1, a ligand of the PD-1 receptor on T 
cells, allowing tumors to suppress T cell activity. Clinical trials utilizing 
antibodies that disrupt the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint have yielded remarkable 
results, with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy approved as first-line therapy for lung 
cancer patients. We used CRISPR-based screening to identify regulators of PD-L1 
in human lung cancer cells, revealing potent induction of PD-L1 upon disruption 
of heme biosynthesis. Impairment of heme production activates the integrated 
stress response (ISR), allowing bypass of inhibitory upstream open reading 
frames in the PD-L1 5' UTR, resulting in enhanced PD-L1 translation and 
suppression of anti-tumor immunity. We demonstrated that ISR-dependent PD-L1 
translation requires the translation initiation factor eIF5B. eIF5B 
overexpression, which is frequent in lung adenocarcinomas and associated with 
poor prognosis, is sufficient to induce PD-L1. These findings illuminate 
mechanisms of immune checkpoint activation and identify targets for therapeutic 
intervention.
