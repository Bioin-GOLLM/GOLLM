PURPOSE: Retinal inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of several retinal 
diseases. As one of the core clock genes, Nr1d1 has been reported to suppress 
inflammation in many diseases. We investigated whether pharmacological 
activation of Nr1d1 can inhibit retinal inflammation and delineated the 
mechanisms of Nr1d1 in alleviating microglia activation.
METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced mice models were used to examine the 
effects of SR9009 (agonist of NR1D1) treatment on inflammatory phenotypes in 
vivo. Anti-inflammatory effects of Nr1d1 and associated mechanisms were 
investigated in the BV2 microglia cell line, and in primary retinal microglia in 
vitro.
RESULTS: SR9009 treatment alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory cell infiltration, 
elevated cytokine levels and morphological changes of the microglia in mice 
models. In LPS-stimulated BV2 cells and primary retinal microglia, SR9009 
suppressed cytokine expressions by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. 
Moreover, SR9009 treatment increased the levels of the M2 phenotype marker 
(CD206) and the proportions of ramified microglia. Suppression of Nr1d1 with 
siRNA reversed the inhibitory effects of SR9009 on cytokine production in BV2 
cells. RNA-seq analysis showed that genes that were upregulated following Nr1d1 
knockdown were enriched in inflammatory-associated biological processes. 
Subsequently, ChIP-seq of NR1D1 in BV2 was performed, and the results were 
integrated with RNA-seq results using the Binding and Expression Target Analysis 
(BETA) tool. Luciferase assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), 
qPCR and Western blotting assays revealed that NR1D1 binds the promoter of Hmga2 
to suppress its transcription. Notably, overexpressed Hmga2 in activated 
microglia could partly abolish the anti-inflammatory effects of Nr1d1.
CONCLUSION: The clock gene Nr1d1 protects against retinal inflammation and 
microglia activation in part by suppressing Hmga2 transcription.
