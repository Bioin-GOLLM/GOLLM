In order to clarify the effects of the Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) 11/19-B1 
strain, a double-blind controlled study of yogurt fermented with the strain was 
carried out. For the study, two kinds of yogurt, the control and test yogurt, 
were prepared; the control yogurt was fermented with Streptococcus thermophiles, 
Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, 
and the test yogurt was enriched with L. lactis 11/19-B1 and Bifidobacterium 
lactis (B. lactis) BB-12 strains. Seventy-six volunteers who had not received 
treatment with pharmaceuticals were randomly divided into two groups with each 
group ingesting 80 g of either the test or control yogurt every day for 8 weeks. 
Before and after yogurt intake, fasting blood was taken and blood sugar, blood 
lipids, and anti-cytomegalovirus cellular immunity were estimated. In the test 
yogurt group, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was significantly decreased (159.1 ± 
25.7 to 149.3 ± 24.4; p = 0.02), but this effect was not observed in the control 
yogurt group. When the test yogurt group was divided into two groups based on 
LDL levels of over or under 120 mg/dL, this effect was only observed in the high 
LDL group. No LDL-lowering effect of B. lactis BB-12 strain was previously 
reported; therefore, the hypocholesterolemic effects observed in this study are 
thought to be caused by the L. lactis 11/19-B1 strain alone or its combination 
with the B. lactis BB-12 strain.
