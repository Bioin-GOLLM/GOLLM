Macrolides of different ring sizes are critically important antimicrobials for 
human medicine and veterinary medicine, though the widely used 15-membered ring 
azithromycin in humans is not approved for use in veterinary medicine. We 
document here the emergence of azithromycin-resistant Salmonella among the NARMS 
culture collections between 2011 and 2021 in food animals and retail meats, some 
with co-resistance to ceftriaxone or decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. 
We also provide insights into the underlying genetic mechanisms and genomic 
contexts, including the first report of a novel combination of azithromycin 
resistance determinants and the characterization of multidrug-resistant 
plasmids. Further, we highlight the emergence of a multidrug-resistant 
Salmonella Newport clone in food animals (mainly cattle) with both azithromycin 
resistance and decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. These findings 
contribute to a better understating of azithromycin resistance mechanisms in 
Salmonella and warrant further investigations on the drivers behind the 
emergence of resistant clones.
