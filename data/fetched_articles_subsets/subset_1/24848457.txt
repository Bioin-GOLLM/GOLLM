Previously, we have shown that human DNA polymerase (Pol) η has two functional 
PCNA-binding motifs, PIP1 and PIP2, and that a C-terminal deletion of Polη that 
lacks the ubiquitin-binding UBZ domain and the PIP2 domain but retains the PIP1 
domain promotes normal levels of translesion synthesis (TLS) opposite a cis-syn 
TT dimer in human cells. Here, we identify two PIP domains in Polκ and show that 
TLS occurs normally in human fibroblast cells in which the pip1 or pip2 mutant 
Polκ is expressed, but mutational inactivation of both PIP domains renders Polκ 
nonfunctional in TLS opposite the thymine glycol lesion. Thus, the two PIP 
domains of Polκ function redundantly in TLS opposite this DNA lesion in human 
cells. However, and surprisingly, whereas mutational inactivation of the PIP1 
domain completely inhibits the stimulation of DNA synthesis by Polκ in the 
presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication factor C, and 
replication protein A, mutations in PIP2 have no adverse effect on 
PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis. This raises the possibility that activation of 
Polκ PIP2 as a PCNA-binding domain occurs during TLS in human cells and that 
protein-protein interactions and post-transcriptional modifications are involved 
in such activation.
