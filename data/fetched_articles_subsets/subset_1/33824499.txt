PURPOSE: Proline Rich 12 (PRR12) is a gene of unknown function with suspected 
DNA-binding activity, expressed in developing mice and human brains. Predicted 
loss-of-function variants in this gene are extremely rare, indicating high 
intolerance of haploinsufficiency.
METHODS: Three individuals with intellectual disability and iris anomalies and 
truncating de novo PRR12 variants were described previously. We add 21 
individuals with similar PRR12 variants identified via matchmaking platforms, 
bringing the total number to 24.
RESULTS: We observed 12 frameshift, 6 nonsense, 1 splice-site, and 2 missense 
variants and one patient with a gross deletion involving PRR12. Three 
individuals had additional genetic findings, possibly confounding the phenotype. 
All patients had developmental impairment. Variable structural eye defects were 
observed in 12/24 individuals (50%) including anophthalmia, microphthalmia, 
colobomas, optic nerve and iris abnormalities. Additional common features 
included hypotonia (61%), heart defects (52%), growth failure (54%), and kidney 
anomalies (35%). PrediXcan analysis showed that phecodes most strongly 
associated with reduced predicted PRR12 expression were enriched for eye- (7/30) 
and kidney- (4/30) phenotypes, such as wet macular degeneration and chronic 
kidney disease.
CONCLUSION: These findings support PRR12 haploinsufficiency as a cause for a 
novel disorder with a wide clinical spectrum marked chiefly by 
neurodevelopmental and eye abnormalities.
