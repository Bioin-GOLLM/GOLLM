Many antidepressants, atomoxetine, and several antipsychotics are metabolized by 
the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, and guidelines for prescribers 
based on genetic variants exist. Although some laboratories offer such testing, 
there is no consensus regarding validated methodology for clinical genotyping of 
CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. The aim of this paper was to cross-validate multiple 
technologies for genotyping CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 against each other, and to 
contribute to feasibility for clinical implementation by providing an enhanced 
range of assay options, customizable automated translation of data into 
haplotypes, and a workflow algorithm. AmpliChip CYP450 and some TaqMan single 
nucleotide variant (SNV) and copy number variant (CNV) data in the Genome-based 
therapeutic drugs for depression (GENDEP) study were used to select 95 samples 
(out of 853) to represent as broad a range of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes as 
possible. These 95 included a larger range of CYP2D6 hybrid configurations than 
have previously been reported using inter-technology data. Genotyping techniques 
employed were: further TaqMan CNV and SNV assays, xTAGv3 Luminex CYP2D6 and 
CYP2C19, PharmacoScan, the Ion AmpliSeq Pharmacogenomics Panel, and, for samples 
with CYP2D6 hybrid configurations, long-range polymerase chain reactions 
(L-PCRs) with Sanger sequencing and Luminex. Agena MassARRAY was also used for 
CYP2C19. This study has led to the development of a broader range of TaqMan SNV 
assays, haplotype phasing methodology with TaqMan adaptable for other 
technologies, a multiplex genotyping method for efficient identification of some 
hybrid haplotypes, a customizable automated translation of SNV and CNV data into 
haplotypes, and a clinical workflow algorithm.
