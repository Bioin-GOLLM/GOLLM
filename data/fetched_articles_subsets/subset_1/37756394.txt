Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a master kinase regulating DNA damage 
response that is activated by DNA double-strand breaks. However, ATM is also 
directly activated by reactive oxygen species, but how oxidative activation is 
achieved remains unknown. We determined the cryo-EM structure of an 
H2O2-activated ATM and showed that under oxidizing conditions, ATM formed an 
intramolecular disulfide bridge between two protomers that are rotated relative 
to each other when compared to the basal state. This rotation is accompanied by 
release of the substrate-blocking PRD region and twisting of the N-lobe relative 
to the C-lobe, which greatly optimizes catalysis. This active site remodeling 
enabled us to capture a substrate (p53) bound to the enzyme. This provides the 
first structural insights into how ATM is activated during oxidative stress.
