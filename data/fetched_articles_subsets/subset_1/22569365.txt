Induced pluripotency depends on cooperativity between expression of defined 
factors and the culture environment. The latter also determines the pluripotent 
cell state, that is, naïve or primed. LIF-JAK/STAT3 signalling was recently 
shown to be a limiting factor for reprogramming to naïve pluripotency. Here we 
show that sufficient activation of JAK/STAT3 overcomes the reprogramming block 
of cell intermediates and enables somatic cell reprogramming in absence of 
otherwise essential pluripotency medium requisites. Activation of FGF-ERK 
signalling, which promotes exit of naïve pluripotent cells from self-renewal, 
does not prevent JAK/STAT3 induced post-implantation epiblast-derived stem cell 
conversion into naïve pluripotency. Moreover, even in the presence of FGF plus 
Activin, which instructs and maintains the primed state, JAK/STAT3 enforces 
naïve pluripotency in epiblast stem cells. We conclude that JAK/STAT3 signalling 
can be sufficient and dominant over antagonistic cues to enable the induction of 
a naïve pluripotent state.
