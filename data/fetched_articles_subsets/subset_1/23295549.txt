BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic inflammatory 
autoimmune disease, affecting 1% of the population worldwide. Single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) of signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 
(STAT4) gene are suspected to have some relationship with the risk of RA. This 
meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relationship between the polymorphism 
rs7574865 in STAT4 gene with RA and also examine whether the associations that 
have been reported in these studies differ between ethnic groups.
METHODS: We retrieved the relevant articles from PubMed, EMBASE and the China 
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. The odds ratios (ORs) and 
their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) associated with the minor T allele of 
STAT4 rs7574865 SNP were extracted from the published studies and included in 
the analysis. Meta-analyses were performed on the total data set and separately 
for the major ethnic groups and RF and anti-CCP status. All analyses were 
performed using the Stata software.
RESULTS: Twenty-three articles were included in the present analysis. 
Meta-analysis showed an association between the STAT4 polymorphism and RA in all 
subjects (OR=1.299, 95%CI=1.230-1.371, P<0.001). Stratified analyses indicated 
that the STAT4 rs7574865 T allele was significantly associated with RA in both 
Caucasians and Asians, in both positive and negative RF patients versus 
controls, also significantly in the presence of anti-CCP, both positive and 
negative. As for genotypes of rs7574865 polymorphism, all the results were 
significant, no matter in total subjects or stratified analyses by ethnic groups 
or by RF and anti-CCP status.
CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphism rs7574865 in STAT4 gene might be associated 
with RA susceptibility in total subjects, major ethnic groups and different 
status of anti-CCP or RF.
