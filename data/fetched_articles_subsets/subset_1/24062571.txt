Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes synaptic dysfunction 
and intellectual disability. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that controls the 
translation or turnover of a subset of mRNAs. Identifying these target 
transcripts is an important step toward understanding the pathology of the 
disease. Here, we show that FMRP regulates actin organization and neurite 
outgrowth via the armadillo protein p0071. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 
lacking FMRP (Fmr1-), the actin cytoskeleton was markedly reorganized with 
reduced stress fibers and F-actin/G-actin ratios compared to fibroblasts 
re-expressing the protein. FMRP interfered with the translation of the p0071 
mRNA in a 3'-UTR-dependent manner. Accordingly, FMRP-depleted cells revealed 
elevated levels of p0071 protein. The knockdown of p0071 in Fmr1- fibroblasts 
restored stress fibers and an elongated cell shape, thus rescuing the Fmr1- 
phenotype, whereas overexpression of p0071 in Fmr1+ cells mimicked the Fmr1- 
phenotype. Moreover, p0071 and FMRP regulated neurite outgrowth and branching in 
a diametrically opposed way in agreement with the negative regulation of p0071 
by FMRP. These results identify p0071 as an important and novel FMRP target and 
strongly suggest that impaired actin cytoskeletal functions mediated by an 
excess of p0071 are key aspects underlying the fragile X syndrome.
