LARS2 variants are associated with Perrault syndrome, characterized by premature 
ovarian failure and hearing loss, and with an infantile lethal multisystem 
disorder: Hydrops, lactic acidosis, sideroblastic anemia (HLASA) in one 
individual. Recently we reported LARS2 deafness with (ovario) leukodystrophy. 
Here we describe five patients with a range of phenotypes, in whom we identified 
biallelic LARS2 variants: three patients with a HLASA-like phenotype, an 
individual with Perrault syndrome whose affected siblings also had 
leukodystrophy, and an individual with a reversible mitochondrial myopathy, 
lactic acidosis, and developmental delay. Three HLASA cases from two unrelated 
families were identified. All were males with genital anomalies. Two survived 
multisystem disease in the neonatal period; both have developmental delay and 
hearing loss. A 55-year old male with deafness has not displayed neurological 
symptoms while his female siblings with Perrault syndrome developed 
leukodystrophy and died in their 30s. Analysis of muscle from a child with a 
reversible myopathy showed reduced LARS2 and mitochondrial complex I levels, and 
an unusual form of degeneration. Analysis of recombinant LARS2 variant proteins 
showed they had reduced aminoacylation efficiency, with HLASA-associated 
variants having the most severe effect. A broad phenotypic spectrum should be 
considered in association with LARS2 variants.
