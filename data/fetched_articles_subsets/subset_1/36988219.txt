BACKGROUND: Although several brain regions and electrophysiological patterns 
have been related to sequence learning, less attention has been paid to the role 
that different neuromodulators play.
AIMS: Here we sought to investigate the role of substance P (SP) in sequence 
learning in an operant conditioning preparation, supported by a reinforcement 
learning model.
METHODS: Two experiments were performed to test the effects of an NK1 receptor 
(at which SP primarily acts) antagonist on learning and performing action 
sequences. In experiment 1, rats were trained to perform an action sequence 
until stable performance was achieved, and then, in phase 2, they were switched 
to perform the reverse sequence. In experiment 2, rats were trained to perform 
an action sequence, and in phase 2, they continued to do the same sequence. In 
both experiments in the first 3â€‰days of phase 2, rats were injected with an NK1 
receptor antagonist (L-733,060, i.p.) or with vehicle. Additionally, we 
developed a reinforcement learning model which allowed the in silico replication 
of our experimental tasks.
RESULTS: We found that administering an NK1 receptor antagonist weakened the 
stable retention of a well-learned sequence, allowing the faster acquisition of 
a new sequence, without impairing the continued performance of a crystallized 
sequence. Using our reinforcement learning model, we suggest that SP could be 
acting through the state value learning rate, modulating the effects of the 
reward prediction error.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SP could be involved in the consolidation 
of a sequence representation through a modulatory effect on the reward 
prediction error.
