Identifying the spectrum of genes required for cancer cell survival can reveal 
essential cancer circuitry and therapeutic targets, but such a map remains 
incomplete for many cancer types. We apply genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 
loss-of-function screens to map the landscape of selectively essential genes in 
chordoma, a bone cancer with few validated targets. This approach confirms a 
known chordoma dependency, TBXT (T; brachyury), and identifies a range of 
additional dependencies, including PTPN11, ADAR, PRKRA, LUC7L2, SRRM2, SLC2A1, 
SLC7A5, FANCM, and THAP1. CDK6, SOX9, and EGFR, genes previously implicated in 
chordoma biology, are also recovered. We find genomic and transcriptomic 
features that predict specific dependencies, including interferon-stimulated 
gene expression, which correlates with ADAR dependence and is elevated in 
chordoma. Validating the therapeutic relevance of dependencies, small-molecule 
inhibitors of SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, have potent preclinical efficacy against 
chordoma. Our results generate an emerging map of chordoma dependencies to 
enable biological and therapeutic hypotheses.
