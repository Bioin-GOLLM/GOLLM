Retinal gene therapy has shown great promise in treating retinitis pigmentosa 
(RP), a primary photoreceptor degeneration that leads to severe sight loss in 
young people. In the present study, we report the first-in-human phase 1/2, 
dose-escalation clinical trial for X-linked RP caused by mutations in the RP 
GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene in 18 patients over up to 6 months of follow-up 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/: NCT03116113). The primary outcome of the study was 
safety, and secondary outcomes included visual acuity, microperimetry and 
central retinal thickness. Apart from steroid-responsive subretinal inflammation 
in patients at the higher doses, there were no notable safety concerns after 
subretinal delivery of an adeno-associated viral vector encoding codon-optimized 
human RPGR (AAV8-coRPGR), meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. Visual 
field improvements beginning at 1 month and maintained to the last point of 
follow-up were observed in six patients.
