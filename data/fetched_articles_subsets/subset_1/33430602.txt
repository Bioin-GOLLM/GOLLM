BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart 
disease. While ≈50% of patients with HCM carry a sarcomere gene mutation 
(sarcomere mutation-positive, HCMSMP), the genetic background is unknown in the 
other half of the patients (sarcomere mutation-negative, HCMSMN). 
Genotype-specific differences have been reported in cardiac function. Moreover, 
HCMSMN patients have later disease onset and a better prognosis than HCMSMP 
patients. To define if genotype-specific derailments at the protein level may 
explain the heterogeneity in disease development, we performed a proteomic 
analysis in cardiac tissue from a clinically well-phenotyped HCM patient group.
METHODS: A proteomics screen was performed in cardiac tissue from 39 HCMSMP 
patients, 11HCMSMN patients, and 8 nonfailing controls. Patients with HCM had 
obstructive cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and 
diastolic dysfunction. A novel MYBPC32373insG mouse model was used to confirm 
functional relevance of our proteomic findings.
RESULTS: In all HCM patient samples, we found lower levels of metabolic pathway 
proteins and higher levels of extracellular matrix proteins. Levels of total and 
detyrosinated α-tubulin were markedly higher in HCMSMP than in HCMSMN and 
controls. Higher tubulin detyrosination was also found in 2 unrelated MYBPC3 
mouse models and its inhibition with parthenolide normalized contraction and 
relaxation time of isolated cardiomyocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that microtubules and especially its 
detyrosination contribute to the pathomechanism of patients with HCMSMP. This is 
of clinical importance since it represents a potential treatment target to 
improve cardiac function in patients with HCMSMP, whereas a beneficial effect 
may be limited in patients with HCMSMN.
