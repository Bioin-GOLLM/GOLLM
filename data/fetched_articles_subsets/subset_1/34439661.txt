Background and objectives: Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia often 
share symptomatology. Psychotic symptoms are prevalent in patients with PD, and 
similar motor symptoms with extrapyramidal signs are frequently observed in 
antipsychotic-naïve patients with schizophrenia as well as premorbid families. 
However, few studies have examined the relationship between PD and 
schizophrenia. We performed this study to evaluate whether genetic variants 
which increase PD risk influence the risk of developing schizophrenia, and vice 
versa. Materials and Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) with 
summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) was 
applied. Summary statistics were extracted for these instruments from GWAS of PD 
and schizophrenia; Results: We found an increase in the risk of schizophrenia 
per one-standard deviation (SD) increase in the genetically-predicted PD risk 
(inverse-variance weighted method, odds ratio = 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 
1.05-1.15; p = 3.49 × 10-5). The association was consistent in sensitivity 
analyses, including multiple TSMR methods, analysis after removing outlier 
variants with potential pleiotropic effects, and analysis after applying 
multiple GWAS subthresholds. No relationships were evident between PD and 
smoking or other psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar affective disorder, 
major depressive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, or alcohol dependence. However, 
we did not find a reverse relationship; genetic variants increasing 
schizophrenia risk did not alter the risk of PD; Conclusions: Overall, our 
findings suggest that increased genetic risk of PD can be associated with 
increased risk of schizophrenia. This association supports the intrinsic nature 
of the psychotic symptom in PD rather than medication or environmental effects. 
Future studies for possible comorbidities and shared genetic structure between 
the two diseases are warranted.
