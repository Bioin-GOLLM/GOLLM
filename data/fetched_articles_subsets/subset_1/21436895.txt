Neuroblastoma is a malignant neoplasm of the developing sympathetic nervous 
system that is notable for its phenotypic diversity. High-risk patients 
typically have widely disseminated disease at diagnosis and a poor survival 
probability, but low-risk patients frequently have localized tumors that are 
almost always cured with little or no chemotherapy. Our genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) has identified common variants within FLJ22536, BARD1, and LMO1 as 
significantly associated with neuroblastoma and more robustly associated with 
high-risk disease. Here we show that a GWAS focused on low-risk cases identified 
SNPs within DUSP12 at 1q23.3 (P = 2.07 × 10⁻⁶), DDX4 and IL31RA both at 5q11.2 
(P = 2.94 × 10⁻⁶ and 6.54 × 10⁻⁷ respectively), and HSD17B12 at 11p11.2 (P = 
4.20 × 10⁻⁷) as being associated with the less aggressive form of the disease. 
These data demonstrate the importance of robust phenotypic data in GWAS analyses 
and identify additional susceptibility variants for neuroblastoma.
