INTRODUCTION: DNA repair systems play essential roles in genomic stability and 
carcinogenesis. Therefore, genotypes at DNA repair loci may contribute to the 
determination of personal susceptibility to cancers. The contribution of human 
8-oxoguanine DNA N-glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) genotypes to renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
is largely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the contributions of hOGG1 
rs1052133 genotypes to the RCC risk.
METHODS: We evaluated the contribution of hOGG1 rs1052133 (G/C) genotypes among 
118 cases and 590 controls and analyzed the interactions of hOGG1 genotypes with 
smoking, alcohol drinking, hypertension, and diabetes status.
RESULTS: The hOGG1 rs1052133 CC genotype was significantly associated with a 
decreased RCC risk compared with that of the GG genotype (odds ratio [OR] = 
0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.09-0.72, p = 0.0049). The frequency of 
the rs1052133 C allele was significantly low in the RCC group (22.5% vs 31.2%; 
OR = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.46-0.89, p = 0.0074). Stratifying the analysis according 
to smoking, alcohol drinking, and diabetes status revealed no difference in the 
rs1052133 genotype distribution among these subgroups. A significant 
differential distribution of rs1052133 genotypes was observed among subjects 
with hypertension.
CONCLUSION: The CC genotype of rs1052133 may play a role in determining RCC 
susceptibility among Taiwanese people and may serve as a biomarker of RCC, 
particularly in patients with hypertension.
