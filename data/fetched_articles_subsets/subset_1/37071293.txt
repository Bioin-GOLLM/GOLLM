Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are widespread in bacteria and archaea plasmids and 
genomes to regulate DNA replication, gene transcription, or protein translation. 
Higher eukaryotic and prokaryotic nucleotide-binding (HEPN) and minimal 
nucleotidyltransferase (MNT) domains are prevalent in prokaryotic genomes and 
constitute TA pairs. However, three gene pairs (MTH304/305, 408/409, and 
463/464) of Methanothermobacter thermautotropicus ΔH HEPN-MNT family have not 
been studied as TA systems. Among these candidates, our study characterizes the 
MTH463/MTH464 TA system. MTH463 expression inhibited Escherichia coli growth, 
whereas MTH464 did not and blocked MTH463 instead. Using site-directed MTH463 
mutagenesis, we determined that amino acids R99G, H104A, and Y106A from the 
R[ɸX]4-6H motif are involved with MTH463 cell toxicity. Furthermore, we 
established that purified MTH463 could degrade MS2 phage RNA, whereas purified 
MTH464 neutralized MTH463 activity in vitro. Our results indicate that the 
endonuclease toxin MTH463 (encoding a HEPN domain) and its cognate antitoxin 
MTH464 (encoding the MNT domain) may act as a type II TA system in M. 
thermautotropicus ΔH. This study provides initial and essential information 
studying TA system functions, primarily archaea HEPN-MNT family.
