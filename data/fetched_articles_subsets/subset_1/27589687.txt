Preclinical models suggest that histone deacetylase (HDAC) and mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have synergistic anticancer activity. We designed 
a phase I study to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 
recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of 
combined mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (1 mg-5 mg PO daily) and HDAC inhibitor 
vorinostat (100 mg-400 mg PO daily) in patients with advanced cancer. Seventy 
patients were enrolled and 46 (66%) were evaluable for DLT assessment since they 
completed cycle 1 without dose modification unless they had DLT. DLTs comprised 
grade 4 thrombocytopenia (n = 6) and grade 3 mucositis (n = 1). Sirolimus 4 mg 
and vorinostat 300 mg was declared RP2D because MTD with sirolimus 5 mg caused 
significant thrombocytopenia. The grade 3 and 4 drug-related toxic effects 
(including DLTs) were thrombocytopenia (31%), neutropenia (8%), anemia (7%), 
fatigue (3%), mucositis (1%), diarrhea (1%), and hyperglycemia (1%). Of the 70 
patients, 35 (50%) required dose interruption or modification and 61 were 
evaluable for response. Partial responses were observed in refractory Hodgkin 
lymphoma (-78%) and perivascular epithelioid tumor (-54%), and stable disease in 
hepatocellular carcinoma and fibromyxoid sarcoma. In conclusion, the combination 
of sirolimus and vorinostat was feasible, with thrombocytopenia as the main DLT. 
Preliminary anticancer activity was observed in patients with refractory Hodgkin 
lymphoma, perivascular epithelioid tumor, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
