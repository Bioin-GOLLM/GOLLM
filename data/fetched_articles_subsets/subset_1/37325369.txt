Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by decreased carnitine levels essential for Beta oxidation in 
various organs, including the heart. Early diagnosis and treatment of PCD can 
revert cardiomyopathy. A 13-year-old girl presented with heart failure due to 
dilated cardiomyopathy and severe cardiac dysfunction; following L carnitine 
treatment, the patient's clinical conditions improved, and cardiac functions 
returned to normal within weeks. Investigations revealed PCD; regular L 
carnitine has been provided, all cardiac medications are discontinued, and the 
patient is doing well. We believe PCD should be ruled out in every patient with 
cardiomyopathy.
