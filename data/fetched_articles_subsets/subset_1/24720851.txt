BACKGROUND: Validating the potential pathogenicity of copy number variants 
(CNVs) identified in genome-wide studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) 
requires detailed assessment of case/control frequencies, inheritance patterns, 
clinical correlations, and functional impact. Here, we characterize a small 
recurrent duplication in the annexin A1 (ANXA1) gene, identified by the Autism 
Genome Project (AGP) study.
METHODS: From the AGP CNV genomic screen in 2,147 ASD individuals, we selected 
for characterization an ANXA1 gene duplication that was absent in 4,964 
population-based controls. We further screened the duplication in a follow-up 
sample including 1,496 patients and 410 controls, and evaluated clinical 
correlations and family segregation. Sequencing of exonic/downstream ANXA1 
regions was performed in 490 ASD patients for identification of additional 
variants.
RESULTS: The ANXA1 duplication, overlapping the last four exons and 3'UTR 
region, had an overall prevalence of 11/3,643 (0.30%) in unrelated ASD patients 
but was not identified in 5,374 controls. Duplication carriers presented no 
distinctive clinical phenotype. Family analysis showed neuropsychiatric deficits 
and ASD traits in multiple relatives carrying the duplication, suggestive of a 
complex genetic inheritance. Sequencing of exonic regions and the 3'UTR 
identified 11 novel changes, but no obvious variants with clinical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide multilevel evidence for a role of ANXA1 in ASD etiology. 
Given its important role as mediator of glucocorticoid function in a wide 
variety of brain processes, including neuroprotection, apoptosis, and control of 
the neuroendocrine system, the results add ANXA1 to the growing list of rare 
candidate genetic etiological factors for ASD.
