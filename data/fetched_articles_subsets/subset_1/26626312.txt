Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) represents the most severe form of inherited 
retinal dystrophies with an onset during the first year of life. Currently, 21 
genes are known to be associated with LCA and recurrent mutations have been 
observed in AIPL1, CEP290, CRB1 and GUCY2D. In addition, sequence analysis of 
LRAT and RPE65 may be important in view of treatments that are emerging for 
patients carrying variants in these genes. Screening of the aforementioned 
variants and genes was performed in 64 Danish LCA probands. Upon the 
identification of heterozygous variants, Sanger sequencing was performed of the 
relevant genes to identify the second allele. In combination with prior arrayed 
primer extension analysis, this led to the identification of two variants in 42 
of 86 cases (49%). Remarkably, biallelic RPE65 variants were identified in 16% 
of the cases, and one novel variant, p.(D110G), was found in seven RPE65 
alleles. We also collected all previously published RPE65 variants, identified 
in 914 alleles of 539 patients with LCA or early-onset retinitis pigmentosa, and 
deposited them in the RPE65 Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD). The in silico 
pathogenicity assessment of the missense and noncanonical splice site variants, 
as well as an analysis of their frequency in ~60â€‰000 control individuals, 
rendered 864 of the alleles to affect function or probably affect function. This 
comprehensive database can now be used to select patients eligible for gene 
augmentation or retinoid supplementation therapies.
