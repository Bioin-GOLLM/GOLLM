To address the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented global effort 
to advance potent neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 as therapeutics. However, 
historical efforts to advance antiviral monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the 
treatment of other respiratory infections have been met with categorical 
failures in the clinic. By investigating the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 and 
similar viruses spread within the lung, along with available biodistribution 
data for systemically injected mAb, we highlight the challenges faced by current 
antiviral mAbs for COVID-19. We summarize some of the leading mAbs currently in 
development, and present the evidence supporting inhaled delivery of antiviral 
mAb as an early intervention against COVID-19 that could prevent important 
pulmonary morbidities associated with the infection.
