Eight primary man-mouse (C11D/TK-) hybrids, twenty three primary and seven 
secondary man-hamster (CH/HGPRT-) were analyzed for human phosphoglycolate 
phosphatase (PGP) and for human chromosomes. The following results were 
obtained: 1. A positive correlation is observed between the chromosome 16 and 
PGP. 15 hybrids are chr.16+PGP+, 14 hybrids are chr.16-PGP- and 4 hybrids are 
chr.16-PGP+. 2. The percentage of dissociation between PGP and the chr.16 is low 
(12%) in comparison with the high percentage of dissociation between PGP and the 
other autosomes (between 37% and 65%). 3. Excepted the chromosome 16, the other 
autosomes are observed in hybrids PGP-. These different results indicate the 
localization of the gene for human PGP on the chromosome 16. The dissociation 
results chr.16-PGP+ are explained by the breakage of the chr.16 in the hybrids.
