BACKGROUND: How germline single nucleotide polymorphisms are involved in the 
etiology of medulloblastoma remans poorly understood. We hypothesized that 
CCDKN2A/B rs1063192 and rs4977756 and also the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
CDKN2BAS rs2157719 glioma susceptibility polymorphisms identified by genome-wide 
association studies may contribute to medulloblastoma predisposition.
METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we genotyped these genetic variants among 160 
medulloblastoma patients and 443 health controls in a Chinese population. Odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: We found that only the lncRNA CDKN2BAS rs2157719 T>C genetic 
polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased medulloblastoma risk 
(C allele: OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.32-2.58; p = 2.7 × 10-4 ). The stratified 
analyses showed an elevated risk of pediatric medulloblastoma associated with 
CDKN2BAS rs2157719 CC or TC genotype (both p < 0.05). Moreover, the association 
between the CDKN2BAS rs2157719 polymorphism and medulloblastoma risk is more 
pronounced in males (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.36-3.62; p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study provide important insights into 
the genetic complexities and predisposition of medulloblastoma in Chinese, 
especially at the lncRNA germline variation level.
