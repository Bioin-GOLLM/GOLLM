Dose response curves of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8) and 3 of its 
methoxinine analogues have been established in 4 conscious dogs with respect to 
gastric and pancreatic secretion. In the analogues the methionine was replaced 
by methoxinine in position 3 (B) and (D) or 6 (C). Of the 4 tested substances 
CCK-8 exhibited most activity with regard to pancreatic protein secretion, 
followed by B, C, and D. Analogue C had the strongest stimulating effect on 
gastric acid secretion, while its effect on pancreatic secretion was minor. 
Correlation of chemical structure with biological activity points to the 
importance of the methionine residue in position 6.
