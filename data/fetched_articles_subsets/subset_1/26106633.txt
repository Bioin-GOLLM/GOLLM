STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: A major objective of investigators is to clarify the 
role of metabolites in achievement of maximum tooth movement with minimal root 
damage during orthodontic tooth movement (OTM).
PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of administration of 
thyroid hormone, prostaglandin E2, and calcium on orthodontic tooth movement and 
root resorption in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: Sixty four male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 8 
groups of eight rats each: 1- 20µg/kg thyroxine was injected in traperitoneally 
after installation of the orthodontic appliance.  2- 0.1 ml of 1 mg/ml 
prostaglandin E2 was injected submucosally.  3- 10% (200 mg/kg) calcium 
gluconate was injected.  4- Prostaglandin E2 was injected submucosally and 10% 
calcium was injected intraperitoneally.  5- Thyroxine was injected 
intraperitoneally and prostaglandin E2 was injected submucosally.  6- 20µg/kg 
thyroxine with calcium was injected. 7- Prostaglandin E2 was injected 
submucosally with calcium and thyroxine.  8- Distilled water was used in control 
group. The orthodontic appliances comprised of a NiTi closed coil were 
posteriorly connected to the right first molar and anteriorly to the upper right 
incisor. OTM was measured with a feeler gauge. The mid-mesial root of the first 
molar and the adjacent tissues were histologically evaluated. The Data were 
analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test.
RESULTS: The highest mean OTM was observed in the thyroxine and prostaglandin E2 
group (Mean±SD = 0.7375±0.1359 mm) that was significantly different (p< 0.05). A 
significant difference (p< 0.05) in root resorption was observed between the 
prostaglandin E2 (0.0192±0.0198 mm(2)) and the other groups.
CONCLUSION: It seems that the combination of thyroxine and prostaglandin E2, 
with a synergistic effect, would decrease the root resorption and increase the 
rate of orthodontic tooth movement in rats.
