The title compound, C20H24N2O4, is the product of a ring-expansion reaction from 
a seven-membered hexa-hydro-azepine to a nine-membered azonine. The azonine ring 
of the mol-ecule adopts a chair-boat conformation. In the crystal, mol-ecules 
are linked by bifurcated N-Hâ‹¯(O,O) hydrogen bonds, generating [010] zigzag 
chains. The title compound shows inhibitory activity against 
acetyl-cholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, and might be considered as a 
candidate for the design of new types of anti-Alzheimer's drugs.
