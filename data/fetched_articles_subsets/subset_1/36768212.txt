Aquaporin-5 (AQP5), belonging to the aquaporins (AQPs) family of transmembrane 
water channels, facilitates osmotically driven water flux across biological 
membranes and the movement of hydrogen peroxide and CO2. Various mechanisms have 
been shown to dynamically regulate AQP5 expression, trafficking, and function. 
Besides fulfilling its primary water permeability function, AQP5 has been shown 
to regulate downstream effectors playing roles in various cellular processes. 
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge of the 
upstream and downstream effectors of AQP5 to gain an in-depth understanding of 
the physiological and pathophysiological processes involving AQP5.
