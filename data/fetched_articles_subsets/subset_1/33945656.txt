Uncovering the structure and function of biomolecules is a fundamental goal in 
structural biology. Membrane-embedded transport proteins are ubiquitous in all 
kingdoms of life. Despite structural flexibility, their mechanisms are typically 
studied by ensemble biochemical methods or by static high-resolution structures, 
which complicate a detailed understanding of their dynamics. Here, we review the 
recent progress of single molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) in 
determining mechanisms and timescales of substrate transport across membranes. 
These studies do not only demonstrate the versatility and suitability of 
state-of-the-art smFRET tools for studying membrane transport proteins but they 
also highlight the importance of membrane mimicking environments in preserving 
the function of these proteins. The current achievements advance our 
understanding of transport mechanisms and have the potential to facilitate 
future progress in drug design.
