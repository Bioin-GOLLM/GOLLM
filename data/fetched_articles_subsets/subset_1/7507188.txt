The biologically cloned human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RF isolate 
is sensitive to neutralization by the murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) G3-4 to a 
conformationally sensitive epitope in the V2 loop of HIV-1 gp120. To assess how 
variation in the V2 amino acid sequence affects neutralization by this MAb, we 
cultured RF in the presence of G3-4 to select neutralization escape mutants. 
Three such mutants resistant to G3-4 neutralization were generated from three 
independent experiments. Solubilized gp120 from each of these escape mutants had 
a reduced affinity for G3-4 and also for two other V2 MAbs that were able to 
bind the wild-type RF gp120. PCR sequencing of the entire gp120 of the wild-type 
RF virus and the escape mutants showed that amino acid substitutions had 
occurred only at two positions, Y177H and L179P, both in V2. Experimental 
introduction of the Y177H substitution into the RF V2 loop in the context of the 
NL4-3 molecular clone re-created the G3-4-resistant phenotype. The L179P mutant 
was not viable. Thus, our findings confirm that the HIV-1 V2 loop contains the 
conformationally sensitive neutralization epitope recognized by G3-4 and that a 
single amino acid substitution within this region can result in escape variants 
that arise from immune selection pressure.
