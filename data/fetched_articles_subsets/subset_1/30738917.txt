3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important platform chemical, but its toxic 
effect at high concentrations (> 200 mM) is a serious challenge for commercial 
production. In this study, a highly 3-HP-tolerant strain of Escherichia coli W 
(tolerance concentration: 400 mM in M9 minimal medium and 800 mM when yeast 
extract was added) was developed by adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) with 
glycerol as the carbon source. Genome analysis of the adapted strain (designated 
as E. coli WA) indicated the presence of mutations in 13 genes, including glpK 
(glycerol kinase) and yieP (a less-studied global regulator). The mutant GlpK 
(K67T) exhibited a higher activity than the wild-type enzyme, but it was not 
beneficial for 3-HP production due to its causing carbon overflow metabolism. 
Interestingly, among the other 12 genes, the mutation in yieP alone was almost 
fully responsible for the improved tolerance to 3-HP. When the mutant yieP was 
substituted with the wild-type counterpart, the adapted E. coli WA strain 
completely lost its tolerance to 3-HP, showing a tolerance similar to the 
wild-type W strain. Deletion of yieP conferred 3-HP tolerance to several other 
E. coli strains including K-12 W3110, K-12 MG1655, and B except BL21 (DE3). The 
E. coli WA with wild-type glpK showed, as compared with its parental strain, 
better 3-HP production, indicating that improved tolerance is beneficial for 
3-HP production.
