Here, we show that the energetics of transmembrane helix heterodimer formation 
can be characterized in liposomes using FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer 
(FRET). We present the theory and the protocol for measuring the free energy of 
heterodimerization, and the total (hetero and homo-dimeric) dimer fraction. We 
use the presented methodology to determine the propensity for heterodimer 
formation between wild-type fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) 
transmembrane domain and the Ala391Glu mutant, linked to Crouzon syndrome with 
acanthosis nigricans.
