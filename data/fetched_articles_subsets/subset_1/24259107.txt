Mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by constitutional aneuploidies. Mutations in BUB1B and CEP57 
genes, which are involved in mitotic spindle and microtubule stabilization, 
respectively, are responsible for a subset of patients with MVA. To date, CEP57 
mutations have been reported only in four probands. We report on a girl with 
this disorder due to c.915-925dup11 mutation in CEP57, which predicts 
p.Leu309ProfsX9 and review the literature in order to facilitate 
genotype-phenotype correlation. Rhizomelic shortening of the upper limbs, skull 
anomalies with conserved head circumference, and absence of tumor development 
could be features suggesting a need for molecular screening of the CEP57 gene in 
patients with this disorder.
