Mutation of the gene PARK2, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the most 
common cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease. In a search for multisite tumor 
suppressors, we identified PARK2 as a frequently targeted gene on chromosome 
6q25.2-q27 in cancer. Here we describe inactivating somatic mutations and 
frequent intragenic deletions of PARK2 in human malignancies. The PARK2 
mutations in cancer occur in the same domains, and sometimes at the same 
residues, as the germline mutations causing familial Parkinson's disease. 
Cancer-specific mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive effects of the PARK2 
protein. PARK2 mutations in cancer decrease PARK2's E3 ligase activity, 
compromising its ability to ubiquitinate cyclin E and resulting in mitotic 
instability. These data strongly point to PARK2 as a tumor suppressor on 
6q25.2-q27. Thus, PARK2, a gene that causes neuronal dysfunction when mutated in 
the germline, may instead contribute to oncogenesis when altered in non-neuronal 
somatic cells.
