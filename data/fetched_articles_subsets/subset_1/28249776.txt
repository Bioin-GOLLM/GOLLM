BACKGROUND: Incontinentia pigmenti (IP; MIM308300) is a severe, male-lethal, 
X-linked, dominant genodermatosis resulting from loss-of-function mutations in 
the IKBKG gene encoding nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO; the 
regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase [IKK] complex). In 80% of cases of IP, the 
deletion of exons 4 to 10 leads to the absence of NEMO and total inhibition of 
NF-κB signaling. Here we describe a new IKBKG mutation responsible for IP 
resulting in an inactive truncated form of NEMO.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify the mechanism or mechanisms by which the 
truncated NEMO protein inhibits the NF-κB signaling pathway.
METHODS: We sequenced the IKBKG gene in patients with IP and performed 
complementation and transactivation assays in NEMO-deficient cells. We also used 
immunoprecipitation assays, immunoblotting, and an in situ proximity ligation 
assay to characterize the truncated NEMO protein interactions with IKK-α, IKK-β, 
TNF receptor-associated factor 6, TNF receptor-associated factor 2, 
receptor-interacting protein 1, Hemo-oxidized iron regulatory protein 2 ligase 1 
(HOIL-1), HOIL-1-interacting protein, and SHANK-associated RH domain-interacting 
protein. Lastly, we assessed NEMO linear ubiquitination using immunoblotting and 
investigated the formation of NEMO-containing structures (using immunostaining 
and confocal microscopy) after cell stimulation with IL-1β.
RESULTS: We identified a novel splice mutation in IKBKG (c.518+2T>G, resulting 
in an in-frame deletion: p.DelQ134_R256). The mutant NEMO lacked part of the CC1 
coiled-coil and HLX2 helical domain. The p.DelQ134_R256 mutation caused 
inhibition of NF-κB signaling, although the truncated NEMO protein interacted 
with proteins involved in activation of NF-κB signaling. The IL-1β-induced 
formation of NEMO-containing structures was impaired in fibroblasts from 
patients with IP carrying the truncated NEMO form (as also observed in HOIL-1-/- 
cells). The truncated NEMO interaction with SHANK-associated RH 
domain-interacting protein was impaired in a male fetus with IP, leading to 
defective linear ubiquitination.
CONCLUSION: We identified a hitherto unreported disease mechanism (defective 
linear ubiquitination) in patients with IP.
