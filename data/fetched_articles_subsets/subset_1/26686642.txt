F-BAR domain proteins regulate and sense membrane curvature by interacting with 
negatively charged phospholipids and assembling into higher-order scaffolds. 
However, regulatory mechanisms controlling these interactions are poorly 
understood. Here, we show that Drosophila Nervous Wreck (Nwk) is autoregulated 
by a C-terminal SH3 domain module that interacts directly with its F-BAR domain. 
Surprisingly, this autoregulation does not mediate a simple "on-off" switch for 
membrane remodeling. Instead, the isolated Nwk F-BAR domain efficiently 
assembles into higher-order structures and deforms membranes only within a 
limited range of negative membrane charge, and autoregulation elevates this 
range. Thus, autoregulation could either reduce membrane binding or promote 
higher-order assembly, depending on local cellular membrane composition. Our 
findings uncover an unexpected mechanism by which lipid composition directs 
membrane remodeling.
