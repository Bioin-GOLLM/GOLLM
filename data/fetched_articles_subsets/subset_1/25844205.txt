Crystal structure of

The title complex, [Cu(C21H38N5Si)(C18H15P)], was obtained from the one-pot 
reaction between (Dipp)N(Li)SiMe3 (Dipp = 2,6-diiso-propyl-phen-yl), Me2NCN, 
CuCl and PPh3. The Cu(I) atom has a distorted trigonal-planar coordination 
sphere. The tri-aza-penta-dienyl ligand acts as a κ(2)-donor. The N-Cu-N bond 
angle is 95.88 (14)°. In the tri-aza-penta-dienyl fragment, the C-N bond lengths 
are in the range 1.328 (5)-1.349 (5) Å, which indicates delocalization of the 
π-electrons in the NCNCN system.
