Mutations in KDM5 family histone demethylases cause intellectual disability in 
humans. However, the molecular mechanisms linking KDM5-regulated transcription 
and cognition remain unknown. Here, we establish Drosophila as a model to 
understand this connection by generating a fly strain harboring an allele 
analogous to a disease-causing missense mutation in human KDM5C (kdm5A512P). 
Transcriptome analysis of kdm5A512P flies revealed a striking downregulation of 
genes required for ribosomal assembly and function and a concomitant reduction 
in translation. kdm5A512P flies also showed impaired learning and/or memory. 
Significantly, the behavioral and transcriptional changes in kdm5A512P flies 
were similar to those specifically lacking demethylase activity. These data 
suggest that the primary defect of the KDM5A512P mutation is a loss of histone 
demethylase activity and reveal an unexpected role for this enzymatic function 
in gene activation. Because translation is critical for neuronal function, we 
propose that this defect contributes to the cognitive defects of kdm5A512P 
flies.
