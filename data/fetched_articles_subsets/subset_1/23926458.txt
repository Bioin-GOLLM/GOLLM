Germline testing for familial cases of myeloid leukemia in adults is becoming 
more common with the recognition of multiple genetic syndromes predisposing 
people to bone marrow disease. Currently, Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments approved testing exists for several myeloid leukemia predisposition 
syndromes: familial platelet disorder with propensity to acute myeloid leukemia 
(FPD/AML), caused by mutations in RUNX1; familial AML with mutated CEBPA; 
familial myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia with mutated GATA2; and the 
inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, including dyskeratosis congenita, a 
disease of abnormal telomere maintenance. With the recognition of additional 
families with a genetic component to their leukemia, new predisposition alleles 
will likely be identified. We highlight how to recognize and manage these cases 
as well as outline the characteristics of the major known syndromes. We look 
forward to future research increasing our understanding of the scope of 
inherited myeloid leukemia syndromes.
