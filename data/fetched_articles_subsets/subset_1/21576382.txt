The germinal center (GC) reaction is essential for the generation of the 
somatically hypermutated, high-affinity antibodies that mediate adaptive 
immunity. Entry into the GC is limited to a small number of B cell clones; 
however, the process by which this limited number of clones is selected is 
unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that low-affinity B cells intrinsically 
capable of seeding a GC reaction fail to expand and become activated in the 
presence of higher-affinity B cells even before GC coalescence. Live multiphoton 
imaging shows that selection is based on the amount of peptide-major 
histocompatibility complex (pMHC) presented to cognate T cells within clusters 
of responding B and T cells at the T-B border. We propose a model in which T 
cell help is restricted to the B cells with the highest amounts of pMHC, thus 
allowing for a dynamic affinity threshold to be imposed on antigen-binding B 
cells.
