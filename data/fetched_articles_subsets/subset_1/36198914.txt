RBM20 is one of the genes predisposing to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Variants 
in the RS domain have been reported in many DCM patients, but the pathogenicity 
of variants within the RNA-recognition motif remains unknown. Two human patients 
with the I536T-RBM20 variant without an apparent DCM phenotype were identified 
in sudden death cohorts. A splicing reporter assay was performed, and an I538T 
knock-in mouse model (Rbm20I538T) was generated to determine the significance of 
this variant. The reporter assay demonstrated that the human I536T variant 
affected the TTN splicing pattern compared to wild-type. In the mouse 
experiments, Rbm20I538T mice showed different splicing patterns in Ttn, Ldb3, 
Camk2d, and Ryr2. The expressions of Casq1, Mybpc2, and Myot were upregulated in 
Rbm20I538T mice, but Rbm20I538T mice showed neither DCM nor cardiac dysfunction 
on histopathological examination and ultrasound echocardiography. The 
I536T-RBM20 (I538T-Rbm20) variant changes gene splicing and affects gene 
expression, but the splicing and expression changes in Ttn and Ca handling genes 
such as Casq1, Camk2d, and Ryr2 do not cause DCM morphology in the mouse model. 
KEY MESSAGES: • Two human patients with the I536T-RBM20 variant without a DCM 
phenotype were identified. • A splicing reporter assay demonstrated that the 
variant affected the TTN splicing. • Rbm20I538T mice showed neither DCM nor 
cardiac dysfunction. • Rbm20I538T mice showed different splicing patterns and 
the gene expressions.
