BACKGROUND: H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) becomes the focus for its ability 
of transmission to mammals and as a donor to provide internal genes to form the 
new epidemic lethal influenza viruses. Residue 627 in PB2 has been proven the 
virulence factor of H9N2 avian influenza virus in mice, but the detailed data 
for inflammation difference between H9N2 virus strains with site 627 mutation is 
still unclear. The inflammasome NLRP3 is recently reported as the cellular 
machinery responsible for activation of inflammatory processes and plays an 
important role during the development of inflammation caused by influenza virus 
infection.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of NLRP3 and its 
related cytokines of IL-1β and TNF-α in BALB/c mice infected by H9N2 AIV strains 
with only a site 627 difference at both mRNA and protein levels at different 
time points.
RESULTS: The results showed that the expression level of NLRP3, IL-1β and TNF-α 
changed in the lung and brain of BALB/c mice after infection by VK627 and 
rVK627E. The immunohistological results showed that the positive cells of NLRP3, 
IL-1β and TNF-α altered the positive levels of original cells in tissues and 
infiltrated inflammatory cells which caused by H9N2 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided the basic data at differences in expression 
pattern of NLRP3 and its related cytokines in BALB/c mice infected by H9N2 
influenza viruses with only a site 627 difference. This implied that NLRP3 
inflammasome plays a role in host response to influenza virus infection and 
determines the outcome of clinical manifestation and pathological injury. This 
will explain the variable of pathological presentation in tissues and enhance 
research on inflammation process of the AIV H9N2 infection.
