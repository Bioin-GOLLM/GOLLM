The peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin1 plays vital roles in diverse 
cellular processes and pathological conditions. NeuroD is a differentiation and 
survival factor for a subset of neurons and pancreatic endocrine cells. Although 
multiple phosphorylation events are known to be crucial for NeuroD function, 
their mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that zebrafish 
embryos deficient in Pin1 displayed phenotypes resembling those associated with 
NeuroD depletion, characterized by defects in formation of mechanosensory hair 
cells. Furthermore, zebrafish Pin1 interacts with NeuroD in a 
phosphorylation-dependent manner. In Pin1-deficient cell lines, NeuroD is 
rapidly degraded. However, the protein stability of NeuroD is restored upon 
overexpression of Pin1. These findings suggest that Pin1 functionally regulates 
NeuroD protein levels by post-phosphorylation cis-trans isomerization during 
neuronal specification.
