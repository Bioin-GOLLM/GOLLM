BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) is a serious concern in 
therapy with antipsychotic medications. To identify single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AIWG, we conducted a genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) for antipsychotic treatment.
METHODS: The discovery cohort consisted of 534 patients with schizophrenia, who 
underwent 8-week treatment with antipsychotics and were genotyped using the 
Illumina Human 610-Quad BeadChip. The independent replication cohort consisted 
of 547 patients with schizophrenia, treated with similar antipsychotics, and 
genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. Two hundred and thirty-six 
drug-naive patients treated with risperidone or quetiapine were analyzed 
independently. Additionally, we conducted pathway and expression analyses using 
several public bioinformatics databases.
RESULTS: After correction for age and gender, the top 2 genome-wide significant 
SNPs with AIWG were located in the PTPRD gene (protein tyrosine phosphatase, 
receptor type D, 9p24-p23; rs10977144, P GWAS = 9.26E-09; rs10977154, P GWAS = 
4.53E-08). The third most significant SNP was in the GFPT2 gene 
(glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase 2, 5q35.3; rs12386481, P GWAS = 
1.98E-07). These results were validated in the replication cohort (rs10977144, P 
Replication = 4.30E-03; rs10977154, P Replication = 6.33E-03; rs12386481, P 
Replication =7.65E-03). These results were also verified in those patients 
initially exposed to risperidone and quetiapine (rs10977144, P = 1.97E-05; 
rs10977154, P = 2.04E-05; rs12386481, P = 1.97E-04). Pathway analyses showed 
that AIWG may involve in multiple pathways related to metabolic processes. 
Moreover, PTPRD mRNA might be highly expressed in brain regions, and the SNPs 
(rs10977144, rs1097154) also showed significant expression quantitative trait 
locus effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that PTPRD polymorphisms might modulate AIWG.
