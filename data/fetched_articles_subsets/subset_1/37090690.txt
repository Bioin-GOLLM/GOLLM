Cytokine storms are an important mechanism of sepsis. TNF-α is an important 
cytokine. As a regulator of TNF superfamily receptors, RIPK1 not only serves as 
the basis of the scaffold structure in complex I to promote the activation of 
the NF-κB and MAPK pathways but also represents an important protein in complex 
II to promote programmed cell death. Ubiquitination of RIPK1 is an important 
regulatory function that determines the activation of cellular inflammatory 
pathways or the activation of death pathways. In this paper, we introduce the 
regulation of RIPK1, RIPK1 PANoptosome's role in Inflammatory and sepsis, and 
perspectives.
