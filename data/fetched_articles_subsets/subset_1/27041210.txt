While implicated in therapeutic resistance, malignant progenitor cell cycle 
kinetics have been difficult to quantify in real-time. We developed an efficient 
lentiviral bicistronic fluorescent, ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator 
reporter (Fucci2BL) to image live single progenitors on a defined niche coupled 
with cell cycle gene expression analysis. We have identified key differences in 
cell cycle regulatory gene expression and transit times between normal and 
chronic myeloid leukemia progenitors that may inform cancer stem cell 
eradication strategies.
