(trk1,2) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based 
proteomic approach.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type (BY4741) and the corresponding mutant lacking 
the plasma membrane main potassium uptake systems (trk1,trk2) were used to 
analyze the consequences of K(+) starvation following a proteomic approach. In 
order to trigger high-affinity mode of potassium transport, cells were 
transferred to potassium-free medium. Protein profile was followed by 
two-dimensional (2-D) gels in samples taken at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 300 min 
during starvation. We observed a general decrease of protein content during 
starvation that was especially drastic in the mutant strain as it was the case 
of an important number of proteins involved in glycolysis. On the contrary, we 
identified proteins related to stress response and alternative energetic 
metabolism that remained clearly present. Neural network-based analysis 
indicated that wild type was able to adapt much faster than the mutant to the 
stress process. We conclude that complete potassium starvation is a stressful 
process for yeast cells, especially for potassium transport mutants, and we 
propose that less stressing conditions should be used in order to study 
potassium homeostasis in yeast.
