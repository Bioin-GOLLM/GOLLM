BACKGROUND: Secretory myoepithelial carcinomas (SMCA) are rare, mucinous, signet 
ring predominant tumors with primitive myoepithelial features. While many 
mucinous salivary gland tumors have now been molecularly characterized, key 
drivers in SMCA have yet to be elucidated. Recently, NKX3.1, a homeodomain 
transcription factor implicated in salivary mucous acinar development was also 
shown in a subset of salivary mucinous neoplasms, salivary intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasms (SG-IPMN). To date, NKX3.1 expression has not been 
characterized in other mucinous salivary lesions. Here, we report molecular and 
extended immunophenotypic findings in SMCA and NKX3.1 expression in the context 
of other head and neck lesions.
METHODS: We retrieved 4 previously reported SMCA, performed additional 
immunohistochemical and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). We also 
investigated the use of NKX3.1 as a marker for SMCA in the context of its 
prevalence and extent (using H-score) in a mixed cohort of retrospectively and 
prospectively tested head and neck lesions (n = 223) and non-neoplastic tissues 
(n = 66).
RESULTS: NKX3.1 positivity was confirmed in normal mucous acini as well as in 
mucous acinar class of lesions (5/6, mean H-score: 136.7), including mucinous 
adenocarcinomas (3/4), SG-IPMN (1/1), and microsecretory adenocarcinoma (MSA) 
(1/1). All SMCA were positive. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for SS18 
rearrangements were negative in all successfully tested cases (0/3). NGS was 
successful in two cases (cases 3 and 4). Case 3 demonstrated a PTEN c.655C>T 
p.Q219* mutation and a SEC16A::NOTCH1 fusion while case 4 (clinically 
aggressive) showed a PTEN c.1026+1G>A p.K342 splice site variant, aTP53 c.524G>A 
p.R175H mutation and a higher tumor mutation burden (29 per Mb). PTEN 
immunohistochemical loss was confirmed in both cases and a subset of tumor cells 
showed strong (extreme) staining for P53 in Case 4.
CONCLUSION: Despite a partial myoepithelial phenotype, SMCA, along with mucinous 
adenocarcinomas/SG-IPMN and MSA, provisionally constitute a mucous acinar class 
of tumors based on morphology and NKX3.1 expression. Like salivary mucinous 
adenocarcinomas/SG-IPMN, SMCA also show alterations of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway 
and may show progressive molecular alterations. We document the first 
extramammary tumor with a SEC16A::NOTCH1 fusion.
