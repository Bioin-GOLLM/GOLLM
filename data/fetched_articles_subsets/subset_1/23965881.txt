OBJECTIVE: Glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSDIb) is caused by a deficiency of 
glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT) activity due to SLC37A4 gene mutations. 
Most GSDIb patients have recurrent infections and inflammatory bowel disease, 
with poor prognosis. Detection of SLC37A4 gene mutations is of great 
significance for the diagnosis, subtyping and outcome prediction of GSD 
patients. This study aims to analyze SLC37A4 gene mutations in Chinese GSDIb 
patients and to investigate the relationship between its genotypes and clinical 
manifestations.
METHODS: All exons and their flanking introns of SLC37A4 gene in 28 Chinese 
children with a primary diagnosis of GSDIb were screened by PCR combined with 
direct DNA sequencing to detect SLC37A4 gene mutations.
RESULTS: Five SLC37A4 gene mutations were detected in 7 (25%) of the 28 
children, i.e., p.Gly149Glu (9/13, 69%), p.Gly115Arg (1/13, 8%), p.Pro191Leu 
(1/13, 8%), c.959-960 insT (1/13, 8%) and c.870+5G>A (1/13, 8%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, c.959-960 insT is a novel mutation and p.Gly149Glu 
is the most common mutation. p.Gly149Glu may be associated with severe 
infections in children with GSDIb.
