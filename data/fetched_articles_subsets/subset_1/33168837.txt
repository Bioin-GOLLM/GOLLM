Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are the major nonepithelial neoplasms 
of the human gastrointestinal tract with a worldwide incidence between 11 and 15 
per million cases annually. In this study the acid and non-acid 
glycosphingolipids of three GISTs were characterized using a combination of 
thin-layer chromatography, chemical staining, binding of carbohydrate 
recognizing ligands, and mass spectrometry. In the non-acid glycosphingolipid 
fractions of the tumors globotetraosylceramide, neolactotetraosylceramide, and 
glycosphingolipids with terminal blood group A, B, H, Lex, Lea, Ley and Leb 
determinants were found. The relative amounts of these non-acid compounds were 
different in the three tumour samples. The acid glycosphingolipid fractions had 
sulfatide, and the gangliosides GM3, GD3, GM1, 
Neu5Acα3neolactotetraosylceramide, GD1a, GT1b and GQ1b. In summary, we have 
characterized the glycosphingolipids of GISTs and found that the pattern differs 
in tumours from different individuals. This detailed characterization of 
glycosphingolipid composition of GISTs could contribute to recognition of new 
molecular targets for GIST treatment and sub-classification.
