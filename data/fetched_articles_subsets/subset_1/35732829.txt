We herein present an overview of the upcoming 5th edition of the World Health 
Organization Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumours focussing on lymphoid 
neoplasms. Myeloid and histiocytic neoplasms will be presented in a separate 
accompanying article. Besides listing the entities of the classification, we 
highlight and explain changes from the revised 4th edition. These include 
reorganization of entities by a hierarchical system as is adopted throughout the 
5th edition of the WHO classification of tumours of all organ systems, 
modification of nomenclature for some entities, revision of diagnostic criteria 
or subtypes, deletion of certain entities, and introduction of new entities, as 
well as inclusion of tumour-like lesions, mesenchymal lesions specific to lymph 
node and spleen, and germline predisposition syndromes associated with the 
lymphoid neoplasms.
