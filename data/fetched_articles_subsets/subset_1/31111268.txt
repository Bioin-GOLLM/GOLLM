Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the leading genetic cause of intellectual 
incapacity worldwide, with a reported incidence of about 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 
1,100 live births. Besides the several commonly known physical features 
characteristic of this syndrome present at birth, DS may additionally affect 
every organ system. In addition, despite the large number of published papers 
concerning this syndrome, there is scarce literature focusing specifically in 
the typical neuroimaging features associated with this condition. The aim of 
this paper is to review and systematize the distinctive characteristics and 
abnormalities of the central nervous system, head and neck, and spine present in 
DS patients that should actively be searched for and evaluated by radiologists 
and/or neuroradiologists.
