Pseudomonas aeruginosa coordinates the secretion of virulence factors through 
quorum sensing. Quorum sensing inhibitors can attenuate the pathogenesis of 
bacteria and help the immune system to eradicate them without targeting the 
bacterial growth. This study aimed to explore the anti-quorum sensing and 
anti-virulence activities of sitagliptin against P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain. 
Sub-inhibitory concentration of sitagliptin significantly inhibited the 
virulence factors pyocyanin, hemolysin, protease and elastase in addition to 
blocking swimming, swarming and twitching motilities and biofilm formation. In 
silico analysis showed that sitagliptin interacted with LasR receptors by 
hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction, mainly with the amino acids 
leucine present at positions 40 and 125, tyrosine at position 56, serine at 
position 129, tryptophan at position 60, alanine at position 50 and phenyl 
alanine at position 101. qRT-PCR confirmed the anti-quorum sensing activity by 
reducing the expression level of QS genes lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR, pqsA and pqsR. 
In conclusion, sitagliptin is a novel anti-quorum sensing agent that can be used 
for treating P. aeruginosa infections.
