BACKGROUND: Mutations of the RET proto-oncogene co-segregate with multiple 
endocrine neoplasia type 2A. A rare sequence abnormality at codon 804 (c804) has 
been reported in 6 kindreds and linked to mild C-cell disease, which raises the 
question of the appropriateness of thyroidectomy in childhood. The purpose of 
this study was to (1) report the clinical correlates of 5 additional c804 
kindreds, and (2) clarify therapeutic options in children.
METHODS: Thirty-eight members from five c804 kindreds underwent genetic 
analysis. Biochemical, operative, and pathology reports were reviewed.
RESULTS: Twenty-three gene carriers were identified, of whom 14 had 
thyroidectomy. Medullary thyroid carcinoma was found in 7 patients (aged 5-56 
years), C-cell hyperplasia in 6 patients (aged 13-40 years), and normal 
histology in a single patient (aged 27 years). One patient with medullary 
thyroid carcinoma died of metastases (aged 12 years). Nine of the 23 gene 
carriers delayed operation, 4 of whom had calcitonin testing. Three of the 4 
patients had abnormal calcitonin levels and a single patient was negative (aged 
40 years). Of the remaining 9 patients, 2 await thyroidectomy, and 3 have 
refused evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: Penetrance of the c804 mutation is highly variable. Medullary 
thyroid carcinoma associated with this genotype has aggressive potential. 
Prophylactic thyroidectomy in childhood is a viable approach.
