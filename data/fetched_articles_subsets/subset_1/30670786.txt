HIV-1 protease autoprocessing liberates the free mature protease from its 
Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor through a series of highly regulated 
autoproteolysis reactions. Herein, we report the development and validation 
(Z' ≥ 0.50) of a cell-based functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) 
of autoprocessing inhibitors using fusion precursors in combination with 
AlphaLISA (amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay ELISA). Through 
pilot screening of a collection of 130 known protease inhibitors, the AlphaLISA 
assay confirmed all 11 HIV protease inhibitors in the library capable of 
suppressing precursor autoprocessing at low micromolar concentrations. 
Meanwhile, other protease inhibitors had no impact on precursor autoprocessing. 
We next conducted HTS of ~23,000 compounds but found no positive hits. Such high 
selectivity is advantageous for large-scale HTS campaigns and as anticipated 
based on assay design because a positive hit needs simultaneously to be 
nontoxic, cell permeable, and inhibiting precursor autoprocessing. Furthermore, 
AlphaLISA quantification of fusion precursors carrying mutations known to cause 
resistance to HIV protease inhibitors faithfully recapitulated the reported 
resistance, suggesting that precursor autoprocessing is a critical step 
contributing to drug resistance. Taken together, this reported AlphaLISA 
platform will provide a useful tool for drug discovery targeting HIV-1 protease 
autoprocessing and for quantification of PI resistance.
