Retinal disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa, age-related retinal 
degeneration, oxygen-induced retinopathy, and ischemia-reperfusion injury cause 
debilitating and irreversible vision loss. While the exact mechanisms underlying 
these conditions remain unclear, there has been a growing body of evidence 
demonstrating the pathological contributions of oxidative stress across 
different cell types within the eye. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 
(Nrf2), a transcriptional activator of antioxidative genes, and its regulator 
Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) have emerged as promising 
therapeutic targets. The purpose of this review is to understand the protective 
role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in different retinal tissues and shed light on 
the complex mechanisms underlying these processes. In the photoreceptors, we 
highlight that Nrf2 preserves their survival and function by maintaining 
oxidation homeostasis. In the retinal pigment epithelium, Nrf2 similarly plays a 
critical role in oxidative stabilization but also maintains mitochondrial 
motility and autophagy-related lipid metabolic processes. In endothelial cells, 
Nrf2 seems to promote proper vascularization and revascularization through 
concurrent activation of antioxidative and angiogenic factors as well as 
inhibition of inflammatory cytokines. Finally, Nrf2 protects retinal ganglion 
cells against apoptotic cell death. Importantly, we show that Nrf2-mediated 
protection of the various retinal tissues corresponds to a preservation of 
functional vision. Altogether, this review underscores the potential of the 
Nrf2-Keap1 pathway as a powerful tool against retinal degeneration. Key insights 
into this elegant oxidative defense mechanism may ultimately pave the path 
toward a universal therapy for various inherited and environmental retinal 
disorders.
