Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B is associated with mutations in the myelin 
protein zero gene. In the present study a new myelin protein zero gene mutation 
(c.89T>C,Ile30Thr) was detected in a family with the Dejerine-Sottas disease 
phenotype. The results support the hypothesis that severe, early-onset 
neuropathy may be related to either an alteration of a conserved amino acid or a 
disruption of the tertiary structure of myelin protein zero.
