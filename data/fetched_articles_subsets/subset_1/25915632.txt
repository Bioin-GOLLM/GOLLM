AIMS: In a recent genome-wide association study, WD-repeat domain 12 (WDR12) was 
associated with early-onset myocardial infarction (MI). However, the function of 
WDR12 in the heart is unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We characterized cardiac expression of WDR12, used 
adenovirus-mediated WDR12 gene delivery to examine effects of WDR12 on left 
ventricular (LV) remodeling, and analyzed relationship between MI associated 
WDR12 allele and cardiac function in human subjects. LV WDR12 protein levels 
were increased in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and rats post-infarction. 
In normal adult rat hearts, WDR12 gene delivery into the anterior wall of the LV 
decreased interventricular septum diastolic and systolic thickness and increased 
the diastolic and systolic diameters of the LV. Moreover, LV ejection fraction 
(9.1%, P<0.05) and fractional shortening (12.2%, P<0.05) were declined. The 
adverse effects of WDR12 gene delivery on cardiac function were associated with 
decreased cellular proliferation, activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK)/heat shock protein (HSP) 27 pathway, and increased protein levels 
of Block of proliferation 1 (BOP1), essential for ribosome biogenesis. 
Post-infarction WDR12 gene delivery decreased E/A ratio (32%, P<0.05) suggesting 
worsening of diastolic function. In human subjects, MI associated WDR12 allele 
was associated significantly with diastolic dysfunction and left atrial size.
CONCLUSIONS: WDR12 triggers distinct deterioration of cardiac function in adult 
rat heart and the MI associated WDR12 variant is associated with diastolic 
dysfunction in human subjects.
