BACKGROUND: Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection is a major global health issue 
around the world. There are approximately 15-20 million individuals infected 
with HDV worldwide. HDV infection usually causes increased mortality compared 
with infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) alone. However, testing for the 
detection of HDV is not widely available in Taiwan. Therefore, the General 
Biologicals Corporation (GB) HDV Ab kit was developed for detecting anti-HDV 
antibodies.
METHODS: A total of 913 serum and 462 EDTA-treated plasma samples were obtained 
from HBsAg-positive individuals in three hospitals in Taiwan from June 2014 to 
November 2017. We used three commercially available ELISA kits, DiaPro HDV Ab, 
DiaSorin ETI-AB-DELTAK-2 and GB HDV Ab, which were utilized strictly according 
to the instructions of the manufacturers.
RESULTS: A comparative study of the results from the GB HDV Ab kit and the other 
commercial ELISA kits (DiaPro and DiaSorin) was performed to determine their 
efficacy for anti-HDV detection. The results indicated that the sensitivity of 
the GB HDV Ab kit for serum and EDTA samples was 100% compared to that of the 
DiaPro and DiaSorin kits, whereas the specificity for serum and EDTA samples was 
99.3 and 98.1%, respectively. In addition, the overall agreement of the results 
of the GB HDV Ab kit for the serum and EDTA samples was 99.3 and 98.3%, 
respectively. It is worth noting that the performance of the GB HDV Ab kit was 
not affected by interference from triglyceride, bilirubin, hemoglobin, or human 
anti-mouse antibody. The limit of detection of the GB HDV Ab kit is 
approximately 100-fold lower than that of the other two commercial kits.
CONCLUSIONS: The GB HDV Ab kit, which presented equivalent sensitivity and 
specificity compared to both certified anti-HDV kits, would be a suitable kit 
for HDV diagnosis in Taiwan.
