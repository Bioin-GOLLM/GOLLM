OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethnic differences in insulin sensitivity (SI) as 
measured by the minimal model approach (SI-MM) and the reference method, the 
euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a prospective study design, thirty Black 
Americans (BA) were age, sex, and BMI matched with non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). 
Participants underwent frequently sampled intravenous tolerance test (FSIVGTT) 
and EHC on 2 separate days during a single visit.
RESULTS: SI-MM values were significantly lower in BA when compared with NHW 
(0.035 ± 0.025 vs. 0.058 ± 0.036 [dL/min]/[μU/mL]; P = 0.003). However, there 
were no ethnic differences in SI measured by EHC (0.028 ± 0.012 vs. 0.035 ± 
0.019 [dL/min]/[μU/mL]; P = 0.18).
CONCLUSIONS: SI-MM systematically underestimates SI in BA when compared with 
NHW. These findings suggest that studies inferring lower SI in BA based on 
FSIVGTT and SI-MM should be interpreted cautiously.
