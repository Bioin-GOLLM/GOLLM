BACKGROUND: The opioid antagonists naloxone/naltrexone are involved in improving 
learning and memory, but their cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unknown. 
We investigated the effect of naloxone/naltrexone on hippocampal 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) 
trafficking, a molecular substrate of learning and memory, as a probable 
mechanism for the antagonists activity.
METHODS: To measure naloxone/naltrexone-regulated AMPAR trafficking, 
pHluorin-GluA1 imaging and biochemical analyses were performed on primary 
hippocampal neurons. To establish the in vivo role of GluA1-Serine 845 (S845) 
phosphorylation on the behavioral effect induced by inhibition of the endogenous 
μ-opioid receptor (MOR) by naltrexone, MOR knockout, and GluA1-S845A mutant (in 
which Ser(845) was mutated to Ala) mice were tested in a water maze after 
chronic naltrexone administration. Behavioral responses and GluA1 levels in the 
hippocampal postsynaptic density in wild-type and GluA1-S845A mutant mice were 
compared using western blot analysis.
RESULTS: In vitro prolonged naloxone/naltrexone exposure significantly increased 
synaptic and extrasynaptic GluA1 membrane expression as well as GluA1-S845 
phosphorylation. In the MOR knockout and GluA1-S845A mutant mice, naltrexone did 
not improve learning, which suggests that naltrexone acts via inhibition of 
endogenous MOR action and alteration of GluA1 phosphorylation. 
Naltrexone-treated wild-type mice had significantly increased phosphorylated 
GluA1-S845 and GluA1 levels in their hippocampal postsynaptic density on the 
third day of acquisition, which is the time when naltrexone significantly 
improved learning.
CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effect of naltrexone on spatial learning and memory 
under normal conditions appears to be the result of increasing GluA1-S845 
phosphorylation-dependent AMPAR trafficking. These results can be further 
explored in a mouse model of memory loss.
