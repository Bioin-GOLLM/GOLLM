OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical features of a Brazilian kindred with 
C9orf72 frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and compare them 
with other described families with C9orf72 and frontotemporal 
dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causing mutations.
DESIGN: Report of a kindred.
SETTING: Dementia center at a university hospital.
PATIENTS: One kindred encompassing 3 generations.
RESULTS: The presence of a hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) expansion in C9orf72 was 
confirmed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot. The 
observed phenotypes were behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with dementia, with significant variability in age 
at onset and duration of disease. Parkinsonian features with focal dystonia, 
visual hallucinations, and more posterior atrophy on neuroimaging than is 
typical for frontotemporal dementia were seen.
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia due to C9orf72 expansion 
displays some phenotypic heterogeneity and may be associated with 
hallucinations, parkinsonism, focal dystonia, and posterior brain atrophy. 
Personality changes may precede the diagnosis of dementia by many years and may 
be a distinguishing feature of this mutation.
