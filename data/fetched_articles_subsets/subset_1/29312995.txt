Osteolytic bone lesions can be a consequence of leukemic bone infiltration or 
focal bone destruction by inflammatory factors released from leukemic cells. 
Destructive bone lesions have a negative impact on the quality of life of 
leukemia patients, causing unbearable pain and, in some cases, limb paralysis. 
However, the mechanism, by which leukemic cells produce destructive bone 
lesions, and the effect of therapeutics on osteolytic lesions have not been 
fully elucidated yet and, thus, stand to benefit from an in vivo model. To that 
end, HL-60 cells were transformed by retrovirus-mediated constitutively active 
(CA) STAT5 expression and injected into nonobese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice via 
the tail vein. After three weeks, lumbar spines were subjected to 
histocytometric analysis. Xenograft mice developed hind limb paralysis in 2-3 
weeks, which was consistent with the consequences of spinal bone destruction by 
extramedullary invasion of leukemia cells. The in vivo model will improve the 
understanding and treatment of osteolytic bone lesions caused by myeloid 
leukemic cells.
