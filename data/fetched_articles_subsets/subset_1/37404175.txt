OBJECTIVES: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a disease with cardiovascular impairment 
and polymorphisms of the gene coding of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
may account for its development. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms of ACE2 
(C>G rs879922, G>A rs2285666 and A>G rs1978124) were found to increase the risk 
for development of arterial hypertension (AH) and cardiovascular (CVS) diseases 
in different ethnicities. We investigated associations of polymorphisms 
rs879922, rs2285666 and rs1978124 with the development of SSc.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood. Restriction-fragment-length 
polymorphism was used for genotyping of rs1978124, while detection of rs879922 
and rs2285666 was based on TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. Serum level of ACE2 was 
assayed with commercially available ELISA test.
RESULTS: 81 SSc patients (60 women, 21 men) were enrolled. Allele C of rs879922 
polymorphism was associated with significantly greater risk for development of 
AH (OR=2.5, p=0.018), but less frequent joint involvement. A strong tendency to 
earlier onset of Raynaud's phenomenon and SSc was seen in carriers of allele A 
of rs2285666 polymorphism. They had lower risk for development of any CVS 
disease (RR=0.4, p=0.051) and tendency to less frequent gastrointestinal 
involvement. Women with genotype AG of rs1978124 polymorphism had significantly 
more frequent digital tip ulcers and lower serum level of ACE2.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms of ACE2 may account for the development of AH and CVS 
disorders in SSc patients. Strong tendencies to more frequent occurrence of 
disease specific characteristics distinct to macrovascular involvement will 
require further studies evaluating significance of ACE2 polymorphisms in SSc.
