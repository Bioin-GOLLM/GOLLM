AIM: To make a gene diagnosis for a family with Ectodysplasin A (EDA) gene 
mutation as well as prenatal diagnosis, and report a novel EDA gene mutation.
METHODS: All coding sequences and flanking sequences of EDA gene were analyzed 
by Sanger sequencing in the proband, and then, according to EDA gene mutation in 
the proband, the EDA gene sequencing was performed on the family members. Based 
on the results above, the pathogenic mutation in EDA gene was finally 
identified, which was used for making prenatal diagnosis.
RESULTS: Sanger sequencing revealed c.302_303delCC [p.Pro101HisfsX11] mutation 
in EDA gene of the proband. This mutation induced EDA gene frame shift mutation 
which led to early termination of EDA gene translation because there was a 
termination codon TAA at the 11th codon behind the mutational site. Heterozygous 
deletion mutation (CC/--) at this locus was observed in the proband's mother and 
proband's grandmother, but the proband's aunt had no mutation at this locus. The 
analyses of amniotic fluid samples indicated negative sex-determining region on 
Y (SRY), and c.302_303delCC heterozygous deletion mutation.
CONCLUSION: We identified a pathogenetic mutation in EDA gene for the X-linked 
hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia family, made a prenatal diagnosis for the 
female carrier, and reported a novel EDA gene mutation.
