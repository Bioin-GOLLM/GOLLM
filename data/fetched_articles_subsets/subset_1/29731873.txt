Increasing number of studies have indicated aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression 
could affect normal biological progress in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
cells. This study was performed to evaluate the biologic functions of 
microRNA-224 (miR-224) in NSCLC. Real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the 
expression of miR-224 and Homeobox D10 (HOXD10) in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. 
Transwell assays were performed to investigate the function of miR-224 on NSCLC 
cell migration and invasion. Moreover, western blotting and luciferase assays 
were used to investigate HOXD10 as miR-224 downstream targets. miR-224 is 
increased in NSCLC metastatic tissues and cell lines. Increased miR-224 
expression promoted NSCLC cell migration and invasion, while low miR-224 
expression suppressed NSCLC cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, HOXD10 was 
targeted directly by miR-224 in NSCLC cells. Moreover, we found that HOXD10 was 
a functional target and influenced tumour-inductive functions of miR-224 on 
progression of NSCLC. These findings suggest that miR-224 may be used in the 
treatment of NSCLC. Targeting this novel strategy, miR-224/HOXD10 axis may be 
helpful as promising biomarker and therapeutic method to control NSCLC cell 
metastasis.
