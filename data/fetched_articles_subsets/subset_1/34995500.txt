Inhibiting the histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, disruptor of 
telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L), increases the efficiency of reprogramming 
somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here, we find that, 
despite the enrichment of H3K79 methylation on thousands of actively transcribed 
genes in somatic cells, DOT1L inhibition (DOT1Li) does not immediately cause the 
shutdown of the somatic transcriptional profile to enable transition to 
pluripotency. Contrary to the prevalent view, DOT1Li promotes iPSC generation 
beyond the mesenchymal to epithelial transition and even from already epithelial 
cell types. DOT1Li is most potent at the midpoint of reprogramming in part by 
repressing Nfix that persists at late stages of reprogramming. Importantly, 
regulation of single genes cannot substitute for DOT1Li, demonstrating that 
H3K79 methylation has pleiotropic effects in maintaining cell identity.
