The expansion of the genetic code with non-canonical amino acids (ncAA) enables 
the chemical and biophysical properties of proteins to be tailored, inside 
cells, with a previously unattainable level of precision. A wide range of ncAA 
with functions not found in canonical amino acids have been genetically encoded 
in recent years and have delivered insights into biological processes that would 
be difficult to access with traditional approaches of molecular biology. A major 
field for the development and application of novel ncAA-functions has been 
transcription and its regulation. This is particularly attractive, since 
advanced DNA sequencing- and proteomics-techniques continue to deliver vast 
information on these processes on a global level, but complementing 
methodologies to study them on a detailed, molecular level and in living cells 
have been comparably scarce. In a growing number of studies, genetic code 
expansion has now been applied to precisely control the chemical properties of 
transcription factors, RNA polymerases and histones, and this has enabled new 
insights into their interactions, conformational changes, cellular localizations 
and the functional roles of posttranslational modifications.
