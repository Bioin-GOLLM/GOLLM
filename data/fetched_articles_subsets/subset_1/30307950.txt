The whooping cough agent Bordetella pertussis coordinately regulates the 
expression of its virulence factors with the two-component system BvgAS. In 
laboratory conditions, specific chemical modulators are used to trigger 
phenotypic modulation of B. pertussis from its default virulent Bvg+ phase to 
avirulent Bvg- or intermediate Bvgi phases, in which no virulence factors or 
only a subset of them are produced, respectively. Whether phenotypic modulation 
occurs in the host remains unknown. In this work, recombinant B. pertussis 
strains harboring BvgS variants were tested in a mouse model of infection and 
analyzed using transcriptomic approaches. Recombinant BP-BvgΔ65, which is in the 
Bvgi phase by default and can be up-modulated to the Bvg+ phase in vitro, could 
colonize the mouse nose but was rapidly cleared from the lungs, while Bvg+-phase 
strains colonized both organs for up to four weeks. These results indicated that 
phenotypic modulation, which might have restored the full virulence capability 
of BP-BvgΔ65, does not occur in mice or is temporally or spatially restricted 
and has no effect in those conditions. Transcriptomic analyses of this and other 
recombinant Bvgi and Bvg+-phase strains revealed that two distinct ranges of 
virulence gene expression allow colonization of the mouse nose and lungs, 
respectively. We also showed that a recombinant strain expressing moderately 
lower levels of the virulence genes than its wild type parent was as efficient 
at colonizing both organs. Altogether, genetic modifications of BvgS generate a 
range of phenotypic phases, which are useful tools to decipher host-pathogen 
interactions.
