Autosomal dominant mental retardation type 5 (MRD5) is a rare neurodevelopmental 
disorder caused by mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene. Here, we established an 
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) of a 30-month-old boy carrying a heterozygous mutation 
(c.2059C > T) in the SYNGAP1 gene. The iPSCs exhibited a normal karyotype, 
expressed pluripotency markers, and displayed differentiation potential in 
vitro.
