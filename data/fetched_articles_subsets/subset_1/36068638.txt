BACKGROUND: Patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) have a risk of 
developing systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We sought to examine the clinical 
characteristics of patients with primary ITP who later developed SLE and 
identified the risk factors for the development of SLE.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined patients who were diagnosed with primary 
ITP at a tertiary hospital between August 2001 and November 2019. We compared 
the clinical characteristics according to the development of SLE. Logistic 
regression analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with the 
development of SLE.
RESULTS: Of 130 patients with primary ITP, 10 (7.7%) were later diagnosed with 
SLE during follow-up (median, 30 months [IQR, 15.5-105]). The presence of skin 
bleeding, organ bleeding, lymphocytopenia, anemia, and antinuclear antibody 
(ANA) positivity (≥ 1:160) were more common among patients who later developed 
SLE than did those who did not develop SLE. Multivariate analysis showed that 
young age (< 40 years; odds ratio [OR], 6.307 [95% confidence interval (CI), 
1.114-34.908]; P = 0.035), organ bleeding (OR, 13.672 [95% CI, 2.437-76.689]; 
P = 0.003), and ANA positivity (1:160; OR, 6.638 [95% CI, 1.399-31.504]; 
P = 0.017) were significantly associated with the development of SLE.
CONCLUSIONS: Young age (< 40 years), organ bleeding, and ANA positivity 
(≥ 1:160) were risk factors for the development of SLE in patients with primary 
ITP. Close follow-up is needed to detect the development of SLE in patients with 
ITP and the abovementioned risk factors.
