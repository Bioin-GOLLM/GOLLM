BACKGROUND: Telomeres play important roles in cancer initiation and progression. 
The aim of this study is to investigate whether leukocyte telomere length (LTL) 
is associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PCa).
METHODS: We measured relative LTL in a cohort of 1,889 white PCa patients who 
were treated and followed up at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer 
Center and assessed its associations with aggressive disease characteristics at 
diagnosis and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after active treatments (radical 
prostatectomy and radiotherapy). We further used a Mendelian randomization (MR) 
approach to compute a weighted genetic risk score (GRS) predictive of LTL using 
10 established LTL-associated genetic variants and determined whether this GRS 
is associated with aggressive PCa.
FINDINGS: LTL was significantly shorter in patients with higher Gleason scores 
at diagnosis. Dichotomized at the median value of LTL, patients with short LTL 
exhibited a 2.74-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.79-4.18, P = 3.11 × 10-6) 
increased risk of presenting with GS≥8 disease than those with long LTL in 
multivariate logistic regression analysis. Moreover, shorter LTL was 
significantly associated with an increased risk of BCR (hazard ratio = 1.53, 95% 
confidence interval, 1.01-2.34) compared to longer LTL in localized patients 
receiving prostatectomy or radiotherapy with a significant dose-response 
association (P for trend = 0.017) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards 
regression analysis. In MR analysis, genetically predicted short LTL was also 
associated with an increased risk of BCR (HR=1.73, 95% CI, 1.08-2.78).
INTERPRETATION: Our results showed for the first time that LTL was shorter in 
PCa patients with high Gleason scores and that short LTL and genetically 
predicted short LTL are associated with worse prognosis in PCa patients 
receiving prostatectomy or radiotherapy.
