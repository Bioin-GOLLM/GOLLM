Norepinephrine (NE) is a key biogenic monoamine neurotransmitter involved in a 
wide range of physiological processes. However, its precise dynamics and 
regulation remain poorly characterized, in part due to limitations of available 
techniques for measuring NE in vivo. Here, we developed a family of GPCR 
activation-based NE (GRABNE) sensors with a 230% peak ΔF/F0 response to NE, good 
photostability, nanomolar-to-micromolar sensitivities, sub-second kinetics, and 
high specificity. Viral- or transgenic-mediated expression of GRABNE sensors was 
able to detect electrical-stimulation-evoked NE release in the locus coeruleus 
(LC) of mouse brain slices, looming-evoked NE release in the midbrain of live 
zebrafish, as well as optogenetically and behaviorally triggered NE release in 
the LC and hypothalamus of freely moving mice. Thus, GRABNE sensors are robust 
tools for rapid and specific monitoring of in vivo NE transmission in both 
physiological and pathological processes.
