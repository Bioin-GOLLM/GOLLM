Isotretinoin is widely applicable in dermatology, although it may develop severe 
side effects in the skeletal system. An intention of this review was to 
establish the safety of oral isotretinoin in patients with bone fractures. Both 
MEDLINE/Pubmed and SCOPUS databases were searched to investigate the influence 
of isotretinoin on the skeletal system. The drug shows a strong osteoporotic 
activity in rats whereas this effect is milder in humans. Biochemical markers of 
bone turnover remain unchanged except for serum calcium in patients receiving a 
high dose of isotretinoin. An excessive intake of vitamin A may impair 
functioning of vitamin D especially in people with a vitamin D deficiency, 
therefore a similar side effect may also occur in patients on isotretinoin 
treatment. We suggest reducing the use of isotretinoin after bone injury or 
continuing the treatment at low dosing with a concomitant correction of vitamin 
D and calcium status.
