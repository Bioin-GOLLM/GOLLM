Venlafaxine is an antidepressant belonging to the class of 
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors that are US Food and Drug 
Administration-approved to treat and manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, and 
other mood disorders in adults. We describe an adolescent patient who likely had 
a false-positive phencyclidine result detected with an 11-panel urine drug 
screen in an outpatient setting of long-term use of therapeutic venlafaxine 
extended release for the treatment of recurrent major depressive disorder and 
generalized anxiety disorder. We believe that this may be the first published 
case report to characterize this phenomenon in a young patient in the absence of 
an acute overdose.
