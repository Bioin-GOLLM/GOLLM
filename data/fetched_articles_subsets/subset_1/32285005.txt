As extracellular vesicles that play an active role in intercellular 
communication by transferring cellular materials to recipient cells, exosomes 
offer great potential as a natural therapeutic drug delivery vehicle. The 
inflammatory responses in various disease models can be attenuated through 
introduction of super-repressor IκB (srIκB), which is the dominant active form 
of IκBα and can inhibit translocation of nuclear factor κB into the nucleus. An 
optogenetically engineered exosome system (EXPLOR) that we previously developed 
was implemented for loading a large amount of srIκB into exosomes. We showed 
that intraperitoneal injection of purified srIκB-loaded exosomes (Exo-srIκBs) 
attenuates mortality and systemic inflammation in septic mouse models. In a 
biodistribution study, Exo-srIκBs were observed mainly in the neutrophils, and 
in monocytes to a lesser extent, in the spleens and livers of mice. Moreover, we 
found that Exo-srIκB alleviates inflammatory responses in monocytic THP-1 cells 
and human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
