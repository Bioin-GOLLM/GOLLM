Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including long intergenic non-coding RNAs 
(lincRNAs), play an important regulatory role in controlling various biological 
processes. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that lincRNA-Cox2 
plays a global regulatory role in regulating the expression of immune genes. 
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived nanosized membrane vesicles that 
have gained increasing attention in recent years due to their ability to 
efficiently deliver therapeutics to specific target organs or cell types. In 
this study, we found that lincRNA-Cox2 controls the expression of a set of cell 
cycle genes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells. Our in 
vitro study suggested that knocking down lincRNA-Cox2 reversed LPS-induced 
microglial proliferation. In addition, our in vivo study demonstrated that 
intranasally delivered lincRNA-Cox2-siRNA loaded EVs could reach the brain 
resulting in a significant decrease in the expression of lincRNA-Cox2 in the 
microglia. Importantly, lincRNA-Cox2-siRNA loaded EVs also decreased LPS-induced 
microglial proliferation in mice. These findings indicate that intranasal 
delivery of EV-loaded small RNA could be developed as therapeutics for treatment 
of a multitude of CNS disorders.
