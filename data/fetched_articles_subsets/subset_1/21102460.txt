Mesenchymal stem cells can give rise to several cell types, but varying results 
depending on isolation methods and tissue source have led to controversies about 
their usefulness in clinical medicine. Here we show that vascular endothelial 
cells can transform into multipotent stem-like cells by an activin-like kinase-2 
(ALK2) receptor-dependent mechanism. In lesions from individuals with 
fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a disease in which heterotopic 
ossification occurs as a result of activating ALK2 mutations, or from transgenic 
mice expressing constitutively active ALK2, chondrocytes and osteoblasts 
expressed endothelial markers. Lineage tracing of heterotopic ossification in 
mice using a Tie2-Cre construct also suggested an endothelial origin of these 
cell types. Expression of constitutively active ALK2 in endothelial cells caused 
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and acquisition of a stem cell-like 
phenotype. Similar results were obtained by treatment of untransfected 
endothelial cells with the ligands transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) or 
bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) in an ALK2-dependent manner. These stem-like 
cells could be triggered to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes or 
adipocytes. We suggest that conversion of endothelial cells to stem-like cells 
may provide a new approach to tissue engineering.
