This study characterized several mutations of the bacteriophage P1 mod gene. 
This gene codes for the subunit of the EcoP1 restriction enzyme that is 
responsible for DNA sequence recognition and for modification methylation. We 
cloned the mutant mod genes into expression vectors and purified the mutant 
proteins to near homogeneity. Two of the mutant mod genes studied were the c2 
clear-plaque mutants described by Scott (Virology 41:66-71, 1970). These mutant 
proteins can recognize EcoP1 sites in DNA and direct restriction but are unable 
to modify DNA. Methylation assays as well as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding 
studies showed that the c2 mutants are methylation deficient because they do not 
bind SAM, and we conclude that the mutations destroy the SAM-binding site. Both 
of the c2 mutations lie within a region of the EcoP1 mod gene that is not 
conserved when compared with the mod gene of the related EcoP15 system. EcoP15 
and EcoP1 recognize different DNA sequences, and we believe that this region of 
the protein may code for the DNA-binding site of the enzyme. The other mutants 
characterized were made by site-directed mutagenesis at codon 240. Evidence is 
presented that one of them, Ser-240----Pro, simultaneously lost the capacity to 
bind SAM and may also have changed its DNA sequence specificity.
