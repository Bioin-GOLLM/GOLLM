Data on intratumoral heterogeneity of small intestine neuroendocrine tumors 
(SI-NETs) and related liver metastasis are limited. The aim of this study was to 
characterize genetic heterogeneity of 5 patients with SI-NETs. Therefore, 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of primary and metastatic 
lesions as well as benign liver of five patients with synchronously 
metastasized, well differentiated SI-NETs were analyzed with whole exome 
sequencing. For one patient, chip based 850k whole DNA methylome analysis was 
performed of primary and metastatic tumor tissue as well as control tissue. 
Thereby, 156 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 150 genes were identified and 
amount of mutations per sample ranged from 9-34 (mean 22). The degree of common 
(0-94%) and private mutations per sample was strongly varying (6-100%). In all 
patients, copy number variations (CNV) were found and the degree of intratumoral 
heterogeneity of CNVs corresponded to SNV analysis. DNA methylation analysis of 
a patient without common SNVs revealed a large overlap of common methylated CpG 
sites. In conclusion, SI-NET primary and metastatic lesions show a highly 
varying degree of intratumoral heterogeneity. Driver events might not be 
detectable with exome analysis only, and further comprehensive studies including 
whole genome and epigenetic analyses are warranted.
