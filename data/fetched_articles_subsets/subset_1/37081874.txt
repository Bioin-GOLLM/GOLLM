The physiological processes of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and 
apoptosis are closely related to STAT3, and it has been demonstrated that 
aberrant STAT3 expression has an impact on the onset and progression of a number 
of inflammatory immunological disorders, fibrotic diseases, and malignancies. In 
order to produce the necessary biological effects, macrophages (M0) can be 
polarized into pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) types in 
response to various microenvironmental stimuli. STAT3 signaling is involved in 
macrophage polarization, and the research of the effect of STAT3 on macrophage 
polarization has gained attention in recent years. In order to provide 
references for the treatment and investigation of disorders related to 
macrophage polarization, this review compiles the pertinent signaling pathways 
associated with STAT3 and macrophage polarization from many fundamental studies.
