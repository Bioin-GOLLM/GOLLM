Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) inhibit ice growth by adsorbing onto specific ice 
planes. Microbial AFPs show diverse antifreeze activity and ice plane 
specificity, while sharing a common molecular scaffold. To probe the molecular 
mechanisms responsible for AFP activity, we here characterized the antifreeze 
activity and crystal structure of TisAFP7 from the snow mold fungus Typhula 
ishikariensis. TisAFP7 exhibited intermediate activity, with the ability to bind 
the basal plane, compared with a hyperactive isoform TisAFP8 and a moderately 
active isoform TisAFP6. Analysis of the TisAFP7 crystal structure revealed a 
bound-water network arranged in a zigzag pattern on the surface of the protein's 
ice-binding site (IBS). While the three AFP isoforms shared the water network 
pattern, the network on TisAFP7 IBS was not extensive, which was likely related 
to its intermediate activity. Analysis of the TisAFP7 crystal structure also 
revealed the presence of additional water molecules that form a ring-like 
network surrounding the hydrophobic side chain of a crucial IBS phenylalanine, 
which might be responsible for the increased adsorption of AFP molecule onto the 
basal plane. Based on these observations, we propose that the extended water 
network and hydrophobic hydration at IBS together determine the TisAFP activity.
