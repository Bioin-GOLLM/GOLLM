The tumor suppressor, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), is a 
Ca(2+)/calmodulin-regulated Ser/Thr kinase with an important role in regulating 
cytoskeletal dynamics. Autophosphorylation within the calmodulin-binding domain 
at Ser-308 inhibits DAPK catalytic activity. Dephosphorylation of Ser-308 by a 
previously unknown phosphatase enhances kinase activity and proteasome-mediated 
degradation of DAPK. In these studies, we identified two holoenzyme forms of 
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), ABalphaC and ABdeltaC, as DAPK-interacting 
proteins. These phosphatase holoenzymes dephosphorylate DAPK at Ser-308 in vitro 
and in vivo resulting in enhanced kinase activity of DAPK. The enzymatic 
activity of PP2A also negatively regulates DAPK levels by enhancing 
proteasome-mediated degradation of the kinase. Overexpression of wild type DAPK 
induces cell rounding and detachment in HEK293 cells; however, this effect is 
not observed following expression of an inactive DAPK S308E mutant. Finally, 
activation of DAPK by PP2A was found to be required for ceramide-induced 
anoikis. Together, our results provide a mechanism by which PP2A and DAPK 
activities control cell adhesion and anoikis.
