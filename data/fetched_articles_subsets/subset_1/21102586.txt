BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRs) have an important role in lung carcinogenesis and 
progression. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in miR 
biogenesis may affect miR expression in lung tissue and be associated with lung 
carcinogenesis and progression.
METHODS: we analysed 12 SNPs in POLR2A, RNASEN and DICER1 genes in 1984 cases 
and 2073 controls from the Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology 
(EAGLE) study. We investigated miR expression profiles in 165 lung 
adenocarcinoma (AD) and 125 squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples from the same 
population. We used logistic and Cox regression models to examine the 
association of individual genotypes and haplotypes with lung cancer risk and 
with lung cancer-specific survival, respectively. SNPs-miR expression 
associations in cases were assessed using two-sample t-tests and global 
permutation tests.
RESULTS: a haplotype in RNASEN (Drosha) was significantly associated with 
shorter lung cancer survival (hazard ratio=1.86, 95% CI=1.19-2.92, P=0.007). In 
AD cases, a SNP within the same haplotype was associated with reduced RNASEN 
mRNA expression (P=0.013) and with miR expression changes (global P=0.007) of 
miRs known to be associated with cancer (e.g., let-7 family, miR-21, miR-25, 
miR-126 and miR15a).
CONCLUSION: inherited variation in the miR-processing machinery can affect miR 
expression levels and lung cancer-specific survival.
