Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that would 
permanently damage the affected joints. Unfortunately, a large proportion of RA 
patients fail to respond adequately to current treatments. Here, repurposing 
hemin and its ultra-long-acting formulation were explored for the effective 
treatment of RA in animal models. We provided evidence that hemin prevented the 
onset and ameliorated the clinical course of RA. Notably, hemin treatment 
rescued the dysregulated gene expression in animal models of RA, resulting in 
attenuation of Th1/Th17 cell-mediated responses and proinflammatory cytokines. 
Moreover, we further formulated hemin into the in-situ forming implant, and a 
single injection of the ultra-long-acting hemin exerted potent disease-modifying 
effects for at least six weeks with a remarkable dose reduction. Taken together, 
given the potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, the 
once-monthly hemin injection holds promise for rapid clinical translation, and 
represents a potential strategy to treat RA and possibly other autoimmune 
diseases.
