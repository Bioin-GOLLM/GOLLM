Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is necessary for microvasculature 
development and important for growth and spread of pancreatic tumors. Functional 
polymorphism of VEGF gene at position C-460T and G+405C may influence VEGF serum 
level. VEGF gene polymorphisms at position C-460T and G+405C were evaluated in 
85 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA), 72 - with chronic pancreatitis 
(CP) and 50 healthy volunteers. VEGF genotypes were studied in DNA isolated from 
blood samples and serum VEGF concentrations were measured. We found an increased 
frequency of the homozygous +405C/C VEGF genotype in patients with PA (55.3%) 
compared with CP (25%) and control group (16%; p<0.01). In contrast, the 
distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of the -460C/T polymorphism in 
the PA patients did not differ from those in CP and control groups. Serum levels 
of VEGF were significantly higher in PA patients (mean level: 441 ± 37.2 pg/ml) 
compared with CP patients (217 ± 13.6 pg/ml; p<0.001) and control group (137 ± 
7.7 pg/ml; p<0.001). No relationship between VEGF serum levels and VEGF gene 
polymorphisms have been found. Our findings suggest that +405C/C VEGF genotype 
may contribute to pancreatic carcinogenesis. VEGF serum levels, although 
elevated in PA patients, are not associated with analysed VEGF polymorphisms.
