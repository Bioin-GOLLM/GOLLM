The R-spondin (RSPO) family of proteins potentiate canonical WNT/β-catenin 
signaling and may provide a mechanism to fine-tune the strength of canonical WNT 
signaling. Although several in vitro studies have clearly demonstrated the 
potentiation of canonical WNT signaling by RSPOs, whether this potentiation 
actually occurs in normal development and tissue function in vivo still remains 
poorly understood. Here, we provide clear evidence of the potentiation of 
canonical WNT signaling by RSPO during mouse facial development by analyzing 
compound Wnt9b and Rspo2 gene knockout mice and utilizing ex vivo facial 
explants. Wnt9b;Rspo2 double mutant mice display facial defects and dysregulated 
gene expression pattern that are significantly more severe than and different 
from those of Wnt9b or Rspo2 null mutant mice. Furthermore, we found suggestive 
evidence that the LGR4/5/6 family of the RSPO receptors may play less critical 
roles in WNT9b:RSPO2 cooperation. Our results suggest that RSPO-induced 
cooperation is a key mechanism for fine-tuning canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling 
in mouse facial development.
