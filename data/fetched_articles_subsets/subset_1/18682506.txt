BACKGROUND: The BRAF(V600E) mutation is the most frequent genetic alteration in 
papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The role of BRAF(V600E) mutation as a poor 
prognostic factor has been controversially reported in series with short-term 
follow-ups. In this study we verified the prognostic value of the BRAF(V600E) 
mutation in PTC patients with a long-term follow-up.
METHODS: We studied 102 PTC patients with a median follow-up of 15 yr. The 
BRAF(V600E) mutation was analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformational 
polymorphism and sequencing. The correlation between the presence/absence of the 
BRAF(V600E) mutation, clinicopathological features, and outcome of PTC patients 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: The BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 38 of 102 (37.3%) PTC patients, 
and was significantly more frequent in patients older than 60 yr (P = 0.02), in 
advanced stages (P = 0.03), and in cases with vascular invasion (P = 0.02). At 
univariate analysis the worst outcome for PTC patients was significantly 
correlated with clinicopathological features (i.e. age, tumor size, extrathyroid 
extension, lymph node and distant metastases, advanced stage, vascular 
endothelial growth factor expression, and vascular invasion) and the BRAF(V600E) 
mutation (P < 0.002). However, at multivariate analysis only the BRAF(V600E) 
mutation showed an independent correlation with the worst outcome (P = 0.03). 
Moreover, the survival curves of PTC patients showed a lower percentage of 
survivors in the BRAF(V600E)-mutated group (P = 0.015).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study the BRAF(V600E) mutation correlated with the worst 
outcome for PTC patients, who were not only at a higher risk not to be cured but 
also for death. In particular, the BRAF(V600E) mutation was demonstrated to be a 
poor prognostic factor independent from other clinicopathological features.
