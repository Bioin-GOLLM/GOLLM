Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a rare skin disease inherited mostly in 
an autosomal dominant manner. Patients display a skin fragility that leads to 
blisters and erosions caused by minor mechanical trauma. EBS phenotypic and 
genotypic variants are caused by genetic defects in intracellular proteins whose 
function is to provide the attachment of basal keratinocytes to the basement 
membrane zone and most EBS cases display mutations in keratin 5 (KRT5) and 
keratin 14 (KRT14) genes. Besides palliative treatments, there is still no 
long-lasting effective cure to correct the mutant gene and abolish the dominant 
negative effect of the pathogenic protein over its wild-type counterpart. Here, 
we propose a molecular strategy for EBS01 patient's keratinocytes carrying a 
monoallelic c.475/495del21 mutation in KRT14 exon 1. Through the CRISPR-Cas9 
system, we perform a specific cleavage only on the mutant allele and restore a 
normal cellular phenotype and a correct intermediate filament network, without 
affecting the epidermal stem cell, referred to as holoclones, which play a 
crucial role in epidermal regeneration.
