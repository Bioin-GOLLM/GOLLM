BACKGROUND: This network meta-analysis assessed the comparative risk of grade 
3-5 and grade 5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) for immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs), either alone or in combination with other modalities, for 
cancer treatment.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and recent 
predominant oncology congresses were searched for relevant phase II and 
phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs). As outcomes, grade 3-5, and grade 
5 TRAE outcomes were reported as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: In 67 RCTs involving 36,422 patients and 19 ICIs, the incidence of 
grade 3-5 and grade 5 TRAEs was 17.9% and 0.8% with ICI monotherapy and 46.3% 
and 1.4%, respectively, with combinatorial therapy. Pneumonitis was the most 
common cause of grade 5 TRAEs following either monotherapy (16.3%) or 
combinatorial therapy (11.4%). Regarding grade 3-5 TRAEs, 
atezolizumab + chemotherapy (CT) and antiangiogenic therapy (AT) 
(atezolizumab + CAT), pembrolizumab + CT, ipilimumab + CT, and atezolizumab + CT 
were more toxic than any ICI monotherapy, pembrolizumab or 
nivolumab + radiotherapy (RT), and ICIs dual therapy (durvalumab + tremelimumab 
and nivolumab + ipilimumab). Tremelimumab, ipilimumab, durvalumab, and 
pembrolizumab were, however, associated with higher grade 5 TRAEs than 
combinatorial treatments. Atezolizumab + CAT was the most toxic and 
nivolumab + RT was the least toxic of combinatorial treatments; among 
monotherapies, tremelimumab and avelumab were the most and least toxic, 
respectively. The toxicity ranking changed with type of grade 3-5 TRAEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with combinatorial therapy, ICI monotherapy caused lower 
grade 3-5 TRAEs, but some monotherapies resulted in a higher incidence of fatal 
TRAEs. Atezolizumab + CAT and nivolumab + RT were the most and least toxic of 
combinatorial treatments, respectively, and tremelimumab and avelumab were the 
most and least toxic of the monotherapies, respectively.
