PURPOSE: Several investigators have tried to assess the role of 
hyperhomocysteinemia and the 677C-T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate 
reductase (MTHFR) gene as risk factors in retinal vein occlusion with 
contrasting results. Aim of the study is to investigate the correlation between 
increased homocysteine plasma level and the homozygosity for the 677C-T mutation 
in the gene MTHFR in patients aged under 50 years affected by central retinal 
vein occlusion (CRVO).
METHODS: Through a prospective, case-control study, 31 patients under 50 years 
of age and diagnosed with CRVO were compared with two control groups. The first 
control group (GROUP I) included 31 subjects matched for age, sex, laboratory 
tests and the main risk factors for atherosclerosis. The second control group 
(GROUP II) consisted of 31 volunteers matched only for age and sex.
RESULTS: The mean homocysteine plasma level was 10.60 micromol/l in patients, 
10.39 micromol/l in GROUP I and 9.34 micromol/l in GROUP II. There was no 
statistically significant difference between mean homocysteine plasma level in 
cases and in GROUP I. Mean homocysteine plasma level was lower in GROUP II than 
in patients, and the difference was statistically significant. Homozygosity for 
the 677C-T mutation in the MTHFR was found in four patients (12.9%), in five 
controls in GROUP I (16.1%) and in four controls in GROUP II (12.9%).
CONCLUSION: Our results support first of all the hypothesis that the 
homocysteine plasma level is not a primary and independent risk factor for 
central retinal vein occlusion, but is more likely a marker of atherosclerosis 
and the consequence of other well-established risk factors. Second, the 
importance of the design of the study is highlighted, since the obtained results 
differed on the basis of the considered control group. This feature could 
contribute to explain the contradictory results previously reported in the 
literature.
