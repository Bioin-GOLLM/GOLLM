Up to 40% of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cases are associated with the Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV). Clonal viral genomes can be found in the HL tumor cells, the 
Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells (HRS). The latent infection results in expression 
of the viral oncogenes LMP1 and LMP2A which contribute to generate the 
particular phenotype of the HRS cells. EBV does not only undergo epigenetic 
changes of its genome during latency, but also induces epigenetic changes in the 
host genome. The presence of EBV may alter the composition and activity of the 
immune cells surrounding the HRS cells. EBV favours a Th1 reaction, but this 
attempt at a cell mediated immune response appears to be ineffective. The 
presence of EBV in HL is associated with several clinicopathological 
characteristics: It is more frequent in cases with mixed cellular histology, in 
males, in children and older adults, and in developing countries, while the 
young-adult onset HL of nodular sclerosis type in industrialized countries is 
typically EBV-negative. Countries in the Mediterranean area often show an 
intermediate epidemiological pattern. Recent studies suggest a genetic 
predisposition to develop EBV-associated HL. Circulating EBV-DNA may serve as a 
biomarker to monitor response to therapy, and eventually, EBV will become a 
target for therapeutic intervention also in HL.
