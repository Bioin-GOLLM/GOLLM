Over 200 million malaria cases globally lead to half-million deaths annually. 
The development of malaria prevalence prediction systems to support malaria care 
pathways has been hindered by lack of data, a tendency towards universal 
"monolithic" models (one-size-fits-all-regions) and a focus on long lead time 
predictions. Current systems do not provide short-term local predictions at an 
accuracy suitable for deployment in clinical practice. Here we show a 
data-driven approach that reliably produces one-month-ahead prevalence 
prediction within a densely populated all-year-round malaria metropolis of over 
3.5 million inhabitants situated in Nigeria which has one of the largest global 
burdens of P. falciparum malaria. We estimate one-month-ahead prevalence in a 
unique 22-years prospective regional dataset of > 9 × 104 participants attending 
our healthcare services. Our system agrees with both magnitude and direction of 
the prediction on validation data achieving MAE ≤ 6 × 10-2, MSE ≤ 7 × 10-3, PCC 
(median 0.63, IQR 0.3) and with more than 80% of estimates within a (+ 0.1 to 
- 0.05) error-tolerance range which is clinically relevant for decision-support 
in our holoendemic setting. Our data-driven approach could facilitate healthcare 
systems to harness their own data to support local malaria care pathways.
