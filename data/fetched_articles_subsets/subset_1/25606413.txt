BACKGROUND: Cataract is the leading cause of bilateral blindness in India. It 
has been reported that cataract is responsible for 50-80% of the bilaterally 
blind in the country. Cataract formation is a natural part of the ageing 
process. At present, adequate data are not available regarding the FABP2 and 
PPARG2 gene polymorphisms and their susceptibility with cataract cases in the 
North Indian population. Thus, the present study was carried out to investigate 
the association of FABP2 and PPARG2 gene polymorphisms with cataract cases and 
controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study includes 130 cataract cases and 118 controls. 
FABP2 and PPARG2 gene polymorphisms in cases and controls were evaluated by 
PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: Frequencies of Ala54Ala, Ala54Thr and Thr54Thr genotypes in FABP2 gene 
in cataract cases and controls were 50.76%, 39.23%, 10% and 25.42%, 61.86%, 
12.71% respectively. The PPARG2 gene CC, CG, GG genotype frequencies were 
11.53%, 87.69% and 0.76% in cases and 21.18%, 39.83% and 38.98% in healthy 
controls respectively. Significant differences were observed in the frequencies 
of FABP2 Ala54Ala, Ala54Thr genotype (p < 0.05) and PPARG2 CC, CG, GG genotype 
(p < 0.05) between cases and controls.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that FABP2 and PPARG2 gene 
polymorphisms can be an informative marker for early identification of 
population at risk of cataract. The potential role of FABP2 and PPARG2 gene 
polymorphisms as a marker of susceptibility to cataract needs further studies in 
a larger number of patients.
