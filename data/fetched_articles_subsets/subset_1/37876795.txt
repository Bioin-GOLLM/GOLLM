Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the irreversible loss of 
dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies. The 
oligomeric α-synuclein (O-αS) is the most toxic form of α-synuclein species, and 
it has been reported to be a robust inflammatory mediator. Mutations in 
Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) are also genetically linked to PD and 
neuroinflammation. However, how O-αS and LRRK2 interact in glial cells remains 
unclear. Here, we reported that LRRK2 G2019S mutation, which is one of the most 
frequent causes of familial PD, enhanced the effects of O-αS on astrocytes both 
in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity could 
relieve the inflammatory effects of both LRRK2 G2019S and O-αS. We also 
demonstrated that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway might be involved in the 
neuroinflammatory responses. These findings revealed that inhibition of LRRK2 
kinase activity may be a viable strategy for suppressing neuroinflammation in 
PD.
