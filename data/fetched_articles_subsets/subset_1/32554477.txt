Carbapenem-nonsusceptible Citrobacter spp. (CNSC) are increasingly recognized as 
health care-associated pathogens. Information regarding their clinical 
epidemiology, genetic diversity, and mechanisms of carbapenem resistance is 
lacking. We examined microbiology records of adult patients at the University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center (UMPC) Presbyterian Hospital (PUH) from 2000 to 2018 
for CNSC, as defined by ertapenem nonsusceptibility. Over this time frame, the 
proportion of CNSC increased from 4% to 10% (P = 0.03), as did daily defined 
carbapenem doses/1,000 patient days (6.52 to 34.5; R2 = 0.831; P < 0.001), which 
correlated with the observed increase in CNSC (lag = 0 years; R2 = 0.660). 
Twenty CNSC isolates from 19 patients at PUH and other UPMC hospitals were 
available for further analysis, including whole-genome short-read sequencing and 
additional antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Of the 19 patients, nearly all 
acquired CNSC in the health care setting and over half had polymicrobial 
cultures containing at least one other organism. Among the 20 CNSC isolates, 
Citrobacter freundii was the predominant species identified (60%). CNSC genomes 
were compared with genomes of carbapenem-susceptible Citrobacter spp. from UPMC 
and with other publicly available CNSC genomes. Isolates carrying genes encoding 
carbapenemases (blaKPC-2,blaKPC-3, and blaNDM-1) were also long-read sequenced, 
and their carbapenemase-encoding plasmid sequences were compared with one 
another and with publicly available sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of 102 UPMC 
Citrobacter genomes showed that CNSC from our setting did not cluster together. 
Similarly, a global phylogeny of 64 CNSC genomes showed a diverse population 
structure. Our findings suggest that both local and global CNSC populations are 
genetically diverse and that CNSC harbor carbapenemase-encoding plasmids found 
in other Enterobacterales.
