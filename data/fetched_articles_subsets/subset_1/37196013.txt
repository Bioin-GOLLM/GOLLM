PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of change in body mass index (BMI) on 
intraocular pressure (IOP) in a large cohort of apparently healthy volunteers 
who underwent an annual comprehensive screening examinations.
METHODS: This study included individuals who were enrolled in the Tel Aviv 
Medical Center Inflammation Survey (TAMCIS) and had IOP and BMI measurements at 
their baseline and follow up visits. Relationships between BMI and IOP and the 
effect of change in BMI on IOP were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 7,782 individuals had at least one IOP measurement at their 
baseline visit, and 2,985 individuals had ≥2 visits recorded. The mean (SD) IOP 
(right eye) was 14.6 (2.5) mm Hg and mean (SD) BMI was 26.4 (4.1) kg/m2. IOP 
positively correlated with BMI levels (r = 0.16, p<0.0001). For individuals with 
morbid obesity (BMI≥35 kg/m2) and ≥2 visits, a change in BMI between the 
baseline and first follow-up visits correlated positively with a change in the 
IOP (r = 0.23, p = 0.029). Subgroup analysis of subjects who had a reduction of 
at least 2 BMI units showed a stronger positive correlation between change in 
BMI and change in IOP (r = 0.29, p<0.0001). For this subgroup, a reduction of 
2.86 kg/m2 of BMI was associated with a reduction of 1 mm Hg in IOP.
CONCLUSIONS: BMI loss correlated with reduction in IOP, and this correlation was 
more pronounced among morbidly obese individuals.
