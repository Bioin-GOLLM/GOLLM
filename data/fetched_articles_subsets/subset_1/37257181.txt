Background: There is extensive interindividual variability in response and 
tolerance to anticancer drugs. This heterogeneity provides a major limitation to 
the "rational" use of cytotoxic drugs, and it becomes a major problem in 
oncology giving a narrow therapeutic window with a vital risk. Among these 
anticancer drugs, irinotecan can cause dose-limiting toxicities, commonly 
diarrhea and neutropenia. Interaction among pathways of activation/inactivation 
(UGT1A1) and hepatobiliary transport of irinotecan and its metabolites could, in 
part, explain its interindividual variability. The objective of this study was 
to perform an exploratory analysis to evaluate the correlation between the 
genetic polymorphisms of UGT1A1 and ABCC2 with the different toxicities 
associated with irinotecan treatment. Materials and Methods: Seventy-five 
patients with solid cancers were included, all were administered an 
irinotecan-based regimen in both Mission Bay Medical Center; and Zuckerberg San 
Francisco General Hospital from May 2016 to December 2016. The patients' 
genotyping was performed for both the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism, and the 
ABCC2 - 1549G>A, and ABCC2 - 1249G>A single nucleotide polymorphism. Comparisons 
among qualitative data were assessed using the χ2-test, and Fisher's exact test 
in the case of small group sizes. Results: Diarrhea was observed in 40 patients 
(53.3%), among them only 9 patients had high grades diarrhea (grades III and 
IV). Grades III/IV of nausea were more frequently associated with the ABCC2-1549 
AA genotype (83.3% p = 0.004) in patients with colorectal cancer. In pancreatic 
cancer, a significant absence of diarrhea grades III-IV was noted in patients 
with the ABCC2 1249 GG genotype compared to the other ABCC2 1249 genotypes.
