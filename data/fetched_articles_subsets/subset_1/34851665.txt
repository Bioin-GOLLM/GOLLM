Balancing instant gratification versus delayed but better gratification is 
important for optimizing survival and reproductive success. Although delayed 
gratification has been studied through human psychological and brain activity 
monitoring and animal research, little is known about its neural basis. We 
successfully trained mice to perform a waiting-for-water-reward delayed 
gratification task and used these animals in physiological recording and optical 
manipulation of neuronal activity during the task to explore its neural basis. 
Our results showed that the activity of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the 
ventral tegmental area increases steadily during the waiting period. Optical 
activation or silencing of these neurons, respectively, extends or reduces the 
duration of waiting. To interpret these data, we developed a reinforcement 
learning model that reproduces our experimental observations. Steady increases 
in DAergic activity signal the value of waiting and support the hypothesis that 
delayed gratification involves real-time deliberation.
