We describe the further utilization of a genetic screen that identifies 
mutations defective in the assembly of proteins into the Escherichia coli 
cytoplasmic membrane. The screen yielded mutations in each of the known genes 
encoding components of the E. coli signal recognition particle pathway: ffh, 
ffs, and ftsY, which encode Ffh, 4.5S RNA, and FtsY, respectively. In addition, 
the screen yielded mutations in secM, which is involved in regulating levels of 
the SecA component of the bacterium's protein export pathway. We used a 
sensitive assay involving biotinylation to show that all of the mutations caused 
defects in the membrane insertions of three topologically distinct membrane 
proteins, AcrB, MalF, and FtsQ. Among the mutations that resulted in membrane 
protein insertion defects, only the secM mutations also showed defects in the 
translocation of proteins into the E. coli periplasm. Genetic evidence suggests 
that the S382T alteration of Ffh affects the interaction between Ffh and 4.5S 
RNA.
