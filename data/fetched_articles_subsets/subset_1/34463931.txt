Belumosudil (REZUROCK™) is a Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein 
kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has been developed by Kadmon Pharmaceuticals for 
the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and systemic 
sclerosis. In July 2021, belumosudil received its first approval in the USA for 
the treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged ≥ 12 years with cGVHD after 
failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. Belumosudil is under 
regulatory review in Australia, Canada, the UK and Switzerland for cGVHD. 
Clinical development for systemic sclerosis is ongoing in the USA. This article 
summarizes the milestones in the development of belumosudil leading to this 
first approval for the treatment of cGVHD.
