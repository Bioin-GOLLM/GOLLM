PIK3R1 (also known as p85Î±) is a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 
3-kinases (PI3Ks). PI3K, a heterodimer of a regulatory subunit and a catalytic 
subunit, phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol into secondary signaling molecules 
involved in regulating metabolic homeostasis. PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol 
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which 
recruits protein kinase AKT to the inner leaflet of the cell membrane to be 
activated and to participate in various metabolic functions. PIK3R1 stabilizes 
and inhibits p110 catalytic activity and serves as an adaptor to interact with 
insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and growth factor receptors. Thus, 
mutations in PIK3R1 or altered expression of PIK3R1 could modulate the activity 
of PI3K and result in significant metabolic outcomes. Interestingly, recent 
studies also found PI3K-independent functions of PIK3R1. Overall, in this 
article, we will provide an updated review of the metabolic functions of PIK3R1 
that includes studies of PIK3R1 in various metabolic tissues using animal 
models, the mechanisms modulating PIK3R1 activity, and studies on the mutations 
of human PIK3R1 gene.
