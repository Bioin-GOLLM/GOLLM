Accurate genome duplication during cell division is essential for life. This 
process is accomplished by the close collaboration between replication factors 
and many additional proteins that provide assistant roles. Replication factors 
establish the replication machineries capable of copying billions of 
nucleotides, while regulatory proteins help to achieve accuracy and efficiency 
of replication. Among regulatory proteins, protein modification enzymes can 
bestow fast and reversible changes to many targets, leading to coordinated 
effects on replication. Recent studies have begun to elucidate how one type of 
protein modification, sumoylation, can modify replication proteins and regulate 
genome duplication through multiple mechanisms. This chapter summarizes these 
new findings, and how they can integrate with the known regulatory circuitries 
of replication. As this area of research is still at its infancy, many 
outstanding questions remain to be explored, and we discuss these issues in 
light of the new advances.
