The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the disease featured by elevated levels 
of androgens, ovulatory dysfunction, and morphological abnormalities. At 
reproductive stage of women, the rate of PCOS occurrence is measured as 6-10% 
and the prevalence rate may be double. There are different pathophysiological 
factors involved in PCOS, and they play a major role in various abnormalities in 
individual patient. It is clear that there is noteworthy elevation of androgen 
in PCOS, causing substantial misery and infertility problems. The overexposure 
of androgen is directly linked with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia. It 
has been reported previously that PCOS is related to cardiac metabolic miseries 
and potently increases the risk of heart diseases. Endometrial cancer is also a 
serious concern which is reported with exceedingly high incidence in women with 
PCOS. However, the overexposure of androgen has direct and specific influence on 
the development of insulin resistance. Although many factors are involved, 
resistance to the insulin and enhanced level of androgen are considered the 
major causes of PCOS. In the present review, we have focused on the 
pathophysiology and major revolutions of insulin resistance and excessive levels 
of androgen in females with PCOS.
