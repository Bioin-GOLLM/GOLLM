Protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of troponin I (cTnI) at Ser42/44 
is increased in heart failure. While studies in rodents demonstrated that 
PKC-mediated Ser42/44 phosphorylation decreases maximal force and ATPase 
activity, PKC incubation of human cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal force. 
We investigated whether Ser42/44 pseudo-phosphorylation affects force 
development and ATPase activity using troponin exchange in human myocardium. 
Additionally, we studied if pseudo-phosphorylated Ser42/44 modulates 
length-dependent activation of force, which is regulated by protein kinase A 
(PKA)-mediated cTnI-Ser23/24 phosphorylation. Isometric force was measured in 
membrane-permeabilized cardiomyocytes exchanged with human recombinant wild-type 
troponin or troponin mutated at Ser42/44 or Ser23/24 into aspartic acid (D) or 
alanine (A) to mimic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. In 
troponin-exchanged donor cardiomyocytes experiments were repeated after PKA 
incubation. ATPase activity was measured in troponin-exchanged cardiac muscle 
strips. Compared to wild-type, 42D/44D decreased Ca(2+)-sensitivity without 
affecting maximal force in failing and donor cardiomyocytes. In donor 
myocardium, 42D/44D did not affect maximal ATPase activity or tension cost. 
Interestingly, 42D/44D blunted the length-dependent increase in 
Ca(2+)-sensitivity induced upon PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Since the drop in 
Ca(2+)-sensitivity at physiological Ca(2+)-concentrations is relatively large 
phosphorylation of Ser42/44 may result in a decrease of force and associated ATP 
utilization in the human heart.
