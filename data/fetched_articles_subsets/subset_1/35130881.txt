BACKGROUND: DNA methylation-associated studies on biliary tract cancer (BTC), 
including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and gallbladder cancer (GBC), may improve the 
BTC classification scheme. We proposed to identify the shared methylation 
changes of BTCs and investigate their associations with genomic aberrations, 
immune characteristics, and survival outcomes.
METHODS: Multi-dimensional data concerning mutation, DNA methylation, 
immune-related features, and clinical data of 57 CCAs and 48 GBCs from Eastern 
Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (EHSH) and 36 CCAs in the TCGA-CHOL cohort were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: In our cohort including 24 intrahepatic CCAs (iCCAs), 20 perihilar CCAs 
(pCCAs), 13 distal CCAs (dCCAs), and 48 GBCs, 3369 common differentially 
methylated regions (DMRs) were identified by comparing tumor and non-tumor 
samples. A lower level of methylation changes of these common DMRs was 
associated with fewer copy number variations, fewer mutational burden, and 
remarkably longer overall survival (OS, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.07, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.01-0.65, P = 0.017). Additionally, a 12-marker model was 
developed and validated for prognostication after curative surgery (HR = 0.21, 
95% CI 0.10-0.43, P < 0.001), which exhibited undifferentiated prognostic 
effects in subgroups defined by anatomic location (iCCAs, d/pCCAs, GBCs), TNM 
stage, and tumor purity. Its prognostic utility remained significant in 
multivariable analysis (HR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.59, P = 0.001). Moreover, the 
BTCs with minimal methylation changes exhibited higher immune-related 
signatures, infiltration of CD8+ lymphocytes, and programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1) expression, indicating an inflamed tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) 
with PD-L1 expression elicited by immune attack, potentially suggesting better 
immunotherapy efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: In BTCs, DNA methylation is a powerful tool for molecular 
classification, serving as a robust indicator of genomic aberrations, survival 
outcomes, and tumor immune microenvironment. Our integrative analysis provides 
insights into the prognostication after curative surgery and patient selection 
for immunotherapy.
