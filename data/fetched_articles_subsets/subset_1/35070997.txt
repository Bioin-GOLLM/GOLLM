BACKGROUND: Hereditary cancer syndromes (HCS) are responsible for 5-10% of 
cancer cases. Genetic testing to identify pathogenic variants associated with 
cancer predisposition has not been routinely available in Vietnam. Consequently, 
the prevalence and genetic landscape of HCS remain unknown.
METHODS: 1165 Vietnamese individuals enrolled in genetic testing at our 
laboratory in 2020. We performed analysis of germline mutations in 17 high- and 
moderate- penetrance genes associated with HCS by next generation sequencing.
RESULTS: A total of 41 pathogenic variants in 11 genes were detected in 3.2% 
individuals. The carrier frequency was 4.2% in people with family or personal 
history of cancer and 2.6% in those without history. The percentage of mutation 
carriers for hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes was 1.3% and for hereditary 
breast and ovarian cancer syndrome was 1.6%. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were the 
most prevalent with the positive rate of 1.3% in the general cohort and 5.1% in 
breast or ovarian cancer patients. Most of BRCA1 mutations located at the BRCA 
C-terminus domains and the top recurrent mutation was NM_007294.3:c.5251C>T 
(p.Arg1751Ter). One novel variant NM_000038.6(APC):c.6665C>A (p.Pro2222His) was 
found in a breast cancer patient with a strong family history of cancer. A case 
study of hereditary cancer syndrome was illustrated to highlight the importance 
of genetic testing.
CONCLUSION: This is the first largest analysis of carrier frequency and mutation 
spectrum of HCS in Vietnam. The findings demonstrate the clinical significance 
of multigene panel testing to identify carriers and their at-risk relatives for 
better cancer surveillance and management strategies.
