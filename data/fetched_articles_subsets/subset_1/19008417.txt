Archaea are prokaryotic organisms that lack endomembrane structures. However, a 
number of hyperthermophilic members of the Kingdom Crenarchaea, including 
members of the Sulfolobus genus, encode homologs of the eukaryotic endosomal 
sorting system components Vps4 and ESCRT-III (endosomal sorting complex required 
for transport-III). We found that Sulfolobus ESCRT-III and Vps4 homologs 
underwent regulation of their expression during the cell cycle. The proteins 
interacted and we established the structural basis of this interaction. 
Furthermore, these proteins specifically localized to the mid-cell during cell 
division. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant Vps4 in Sulfolobus 
resulted in the accumulation of enlarged cells, indicative of failed cell 
division. Thus, the archaeal ESCRT system plays a key role in cell division.
