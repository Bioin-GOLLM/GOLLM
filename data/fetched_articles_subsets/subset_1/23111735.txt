BACKGROUND: Overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) has 
been found to play an important role in malignant progression of various cancer 
cells, in addition to lymphangiogenesis. However, the mechanisms involved are 
still largely unknown. Our early research has confirmed that the expression of 
VEGF-C in bladder cancer was markedly higher than that in normal bladder 
tissues. VEGF-C can also obviously promote proliferation and invasion of bladder 
cancer T24 cells. In the present work, we attempted to use proteomic analysis to 
screen out potential VEGF-C-associated proteins involved in malignant 
progression of the bladder cancer T24 cells.
MATERIAL/METHODS: Lentivirus vector-based RNA interference (RNAi) was employed 
to diminish VEGF-C expression of bladder cancer T24 cells. Then we performed 
comparative proteome analysis to explore differentially expressed proteins in 
T24 cells with and without VEGF-C siRNA, by two-dimensional difference gel 
electrophoresis (2D-DIGE).
RESULTS: Twenty-three proteins were identified. Some proteins (matrix 
metalloproteinase-9, Keratin 8, Serpin B5, Annexin A8) with significant 
differences were further confirmed by Western blotting.
CONCLUSIONS: The 23 potential VEGF-C-associated proteins identified in our study 
provide us with further insights into the mechanism of VEGF-C promoting 
malignant progression of bladder cancer cells.
