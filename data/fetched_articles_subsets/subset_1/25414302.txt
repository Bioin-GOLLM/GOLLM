Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is an aggressive disease that is 
rising in incidence. Although melanoma is a historically treatment-resistant 
malignancy, in recent years unprecedented breakthroughs in targeted therapies 
and immunotherapies have revolutionized the standard of care for patients with 
advanced disease. Here, we provide an overview of recent developments in our 
understanding of melanoma risk factors, genomics, and molecular pathogenesis and 
how these insights have driven advances in melanoma treatment. In addition, we 
review benefits and limitations of current therapies and look ahead to continued 
progress in melanoma prevention and therapy. Remarkable achievements in the 
field have already produced a paradigm shift in melanoma treatment: Metastatic 
melanoma, once considered incurable, can now be treated with potentially 
curative rather than palliative intent.
