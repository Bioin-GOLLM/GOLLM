Active DNA demethylation is involved in many vital developmental and 
physiological processes of plants and animals. Recent genetic and biochemical 
studies in Arabidopsis have demonstrated that a subfamily of DNA glycosylases 
function to promote DNA demethylation through a base excision-repair pathway. 
These specialized bifunctional DNA glycosylases remove the 5-methylcytosine base 
and then cleave the DNA backbone at the abasic site, resulting in a gap that is 
then filled with an unmethylated cytosine nucleotide by as yet unknown DNA 
polymerase and ligase enzymes. Evidence suggests that active DNA demethylation 
in mammalian cells is also mediated at least in part by a base excision repair 
pathway where the AID/Apobec family of deaminases convert 5-methylcytosine to 
thymine followed by G/T mismatch repair by the DNA glycosylase MBD4 or TDG. This 
review also discusses other possible mechanisms of active DNA demethylation, how 
genome DNA methylation status might be sensed to regulate the expression of 
demethylase genes, and the targeting of demethylases by small RNAs.
