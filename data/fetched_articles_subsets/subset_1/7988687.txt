Human lysozyme dimers were prepared by the intermolecular cross-linking of the 
monomer that contained the mutation of either Arg41 to Cys or Ala73 to Cys with 
a divalent maleimide compound. Among the three kinds of possible dimers only 
R41C-R41C dimer, in which the two catalytic clefts can come close to each other 
due to the proximity of the conjugation site to the active sites, turned out to 
be 2.3 times more specific to a polymer substrate, ethylene glycol chitin, as 
compared to an oligomer substrate, PNP-(GlcNAc)5. The result indicates that it 
is possible to alter the substrate specificity of an enzyme by artificially 
controlling the orientation of the active sites.
