BACKGROUND: In the past decades, researchers have demonstrated the critical role 
of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the innate immune system. They recognize viral 
components and trigger immune signal cascades to subsequently promote the 
activation of the immune system.
MAIN BODY: Herpesviridae family members trigger TLRs to elicit cytokines in the 
process of infection to activate antiviral innate immune responses in host 
cells. This review aims to clarify the role of TLRs in the innate immunity 
defense against herpesviridae, and systematically describes the processes of TLR 
actions and herpesviridae recognition as well as the signal transduction 
pathways involved.
CONCLUSIONS: Future studies of the interactions between TLRs and herpesviridae 
infections, especially the subsequent signaling pathways, will not only 
contribute to the planning of effective antiviral therapies but also provide new 
molecular targets for the development of antiviral drugs.
