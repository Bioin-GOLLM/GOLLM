Acute spinal cord infarct in childhood is extremely rare, generally secondary to 
spinal/cardiovascular surgery or severe vertebral injuries. However, spontaneous 
spinal cord infarct cases have been described. We present a clinical case of a 
teenager who developed an acute weakness and paraesthesia in lower limbs after 
playing piggyback. Laboratory tests and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) were 
normal. During her hospital admission, her motor strength improved. After 10 
days, MRI was repeated, and a bone infarct was observed. She was medicated with 
acetylsalicylic acid, and she completed a rehabilitation program.
