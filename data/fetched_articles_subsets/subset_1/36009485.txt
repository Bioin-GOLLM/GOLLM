Despite increasing availability and more successful interventional approaches to 
restore coronary reperfusion, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is a 
substantial cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. During myocardial 
ischemia, the myocardium becomes profoundly hypoxic, thus causing stabilization 
of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF). Stabilization of HIF leads to 
a transcriptional program that promotes adaptation to hypoxia and cellular 
survival. Transcriptional consequences of HIF stabilization include increases in 
extracellular production and signaling effects of adenosine. Extracellular 
adenosine functions as a signaling molecule via the activation of adenosine 
receptors. Several studies implicated adenosine signaling in cardioprotection, 
particularly through the activation of the Adora2a and Adora2b receptors. 
Adenosine receptor activation can lead to metabolic adaptation to enhance 
ischemia tolerance or dampen myocardial reperfusion injury via signaling events 
on immune cells. Many studies highlight that clinical strategies to target the 
hypoxia-adenosine link could be considered for clinical trials. This could be 
achieved by using pharmacologic HIF activators or by directly enhancing 
extracellular adenosine production or signaling as a therapy for patients with 
acute myocardial infarction, or undergoing cardiac surgery.
