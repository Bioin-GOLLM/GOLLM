A large proportion of colorectal carcinomas (CRC) evolve from colorectal 
adenomas. However, not all individuals with colonic adenomas have a risk of CRC 
substantially higher than those of the general population. The aim of the study 
was to determine the differences or similarities of mutation profile among low- 
and high-grade adenomas and in situ carcinoma with detailed follow up. We have 
investigated the mutation spectrum of well-known genes involved in CRC (such as 
APC, BRAF, EGFR, NRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, POLE, POLD1, SMAD4, PTEN, and TP53) in a 
large, well-defined series of 96 adenomas and in situ carcinomas using a 
high-throughput genotyping technique. Besides, the microsatellite instability 
and APC and MLH1 promoter methylation were studied as well. We observed a high 
frequency of pathogenic variants in the studied genes. The APC, KRAS and TP53 
mutation frequencies were slightly lower in adenoma samples than in in situ 
carcinoma samples. Further, when we stratified mutation frequency based on the 
grade, the frequency distribution was as follows: low-grade adenoma-high-grade 
adenomas-in situ carcinoma: APC gene 42.9-56.0-54.5%; KRAS gene 32.7-32.0-45.5%; 
TP53 gene 8.2-20.0-18.2%. The occurrence of KRAS mutation was associated with 
the presence of villous histology and methylation of the APC promoter was 
significantly associated with the presence of POLE genetic variations. However, 
no association was noticed with the presence of any singular mutation and 
occurrence of subsequent adenoma or CRC. Our data supports the multistep model 
of gradual accumulation of mutations, especially in the driver genes, such as 
APC, TP53 and KRAS.
