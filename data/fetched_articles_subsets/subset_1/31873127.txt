mice.

Energy imbalance due to excess of calories is considered to be a major player in 
the current worldwide obesity pandemic and could be accompanied by systemic and 
central inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions. This hypothesis was tested 
by comparing the wild-derived diet-induced obesity- (DIO-) resistant mouse 
strain WSB/EiJ to the obesity-prone C57BL/6J strain. We analysed circulating and 
hypothalamic markers of inflammatory status and hypothalamic mitochondrial 
activity in both strains exposed to high-fat diet (HFD). We further analysed the 
regulations of hypothalamic genes involved in inflammation and mitochondrial 
pathways by high throughput microfluidic qPCR on RNA extracted from laser 
micro-dissected arcuate (ARC) and paraventricular (PVN) hypothalamic nuclei. HFD 
induced increased body weight gain, circulating levels of leptin, cholesterol, 
HDL and LDL in C57BL/6J whereas WSB/EiJ mice displayed a lower inflammatory 
status, both peripherally (lower levels of circulating cytokines) and centrally 
(less activated microglia in the hypothalamus) as well as more reactive 
mitochondria in the hypothalamus. The gene expression data analysis allowed 
identifying strain-specific hypothalamic metabolic pathways involved in the 
respective responses to HFD. Our results point to the involvement of 
hypothalamic inflammatory and mitochondrial pathways as key factors in the 
control of energy homeostasis and the resistance to DIO.
