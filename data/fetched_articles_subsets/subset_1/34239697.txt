Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by pulmonary vessel 
remodeling; however, its severity and impact on survival depend on right 
ventricular (RV) failure. Resveratrol (RES), a polyphenol found in red wine, 
exhibits cardioprotective effects on RV dysfunction in PAH. However, most 
literature has focused on RES protective effect on lung vasculature; recent 
finding indicates that RES has a cardioprotective effect independent of 
pulmonary arterial pressure on RV dysfunction, although the underlying mechanism 
in RV has not been determined. Therefore, this study is aimed at evaluating 
sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) modulation by RES in RV using a monocrotaline- (MC-) induced 
PAH rat model. Myocyte function was evaluated by confocal microscopy as cell 
contractility, calcium signaling, and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm); 
cell energetics was assessed by high-resolution respirometry, and western blot 
and immunoprecipitation evaluated posttranslational modifications. PAH 
significantly affects mitochondrial function in RV; PAH is prone to 
mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, thus decreasing the 
mitochondrial membrane potential. The compromised cellular energetics affects 
cardiomyocyte function by decreasing sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 
(SERCA) activity and delaying myofilament unbinding, disrupting cell relaxation. 
RES partially protects mitochondrial integrity by deacetylating cyclophilin-D, a 
critical component of the mPTP, increasing SIRT3 expression and activity and 
preventing mPTP opening. The preserved energetic capability rescues cell 
relaxation by maintaining SERCA activity. Avoiding Ca2+ transient and cell 
contractility mismatch by preserving mitochondrial function describes, for the 
first time, impairment in excitation-contraction-energetics coupling in RV 
failure. These results highlight the importance of mitochondrial energetics and 
mPTP in PAH.
