R-loops, which consist of a DNA/RNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA 
(ssDNA), are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of chromatin 
biology. R-loops are particularly enriched at gene promoters, where they play 
important roles in regulating gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms 
that control promoter-associated R-loops remain unclear. The epigenetic 'reader' 
Tudor domain-containing protein 3 (TDRD3), which recognizes methylarginine marks 
on histones and on the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, was previously 
shown to recruit DNA topoisomerase 3B (TOP3B) to relax negatively supercoiled 
DNA and prevent R-loop formation. Here, we further characterize the function of 
TDRD3 in R-loop metabolism and introduce the DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9) as a 
novel interaction partner of the TDRD3/TOP3B complex. TDRD3 directly interacts 
with DHX9 via its Tudor domain. This interaction is important for recruiting 
DHX9 to target gene promoters, where it resolves R-loops in a helicase 
activity-dependent manner to facilitate gene expression. Additionally, TDRD3 
also stimulates the helicase activity of DHX9. This stimulation relies on the 
OB-fold of TDRD3, which likely binds the ssDNA in the R-loop structure. Thus, 
DHX9 functions together with TOP3B to suppress promoter-associated R-loops. 
Collectively, these findings reveal new functions of TDRD3 and provide important 
mechanistic insights into the regulation of R-loop metabolism.
