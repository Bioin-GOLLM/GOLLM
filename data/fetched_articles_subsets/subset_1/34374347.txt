BACKGROUND: The emergence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) 
represents a major clinical problem. Recently, the occurrence of CPE has 
increased globally, but epidemiological patterns vary across region. We report 
the trends in the genotypic distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of CPE 
isolated from rectal and clinical samples during a four-year period.
METHODS: Between January 2016 and December 2019, 1,254 nonduplicated CPE 
isolates were obtained from four university hospitals in Korea. Carbapenemase 
genotypes were determined by multiplex real-time PCR. Antimicrobial 
susceptibility was profiled using the Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux, Hazelwood, MO, 
USA) or MicroScan Walkaway-96 system (Siemens West Sacramento, CA, USA). The 
proportions of carbapenemase genotypes and nonsusceptibility were analyzed using 
Pearson's chi-square test.
RESULTS: Among the 1,254 CPE isolates, 486 (38.8%), 371 (29.6%), 357 (28.5%), 8 
(0.6%), 8 (0.6%), and 24 (1.9%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), 
oxacillinase (OXA)-48-like, New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM), imipenemase 
(IMP), Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM), and multiple 
producers, respectively. The predominant species was K. pneumoniae (72.6%), 
followed by Escherichia coli (6.5%). More than 90% of the isolates harboring 
KPC, NDM, and OXA-48-like were nonsusceptible to cephalosporins, aztreonam, and 
carbapenems.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of CPE is primarily due to KPC-, NDM-, and 
OXA-48-like-producing K. pneumoniae isolates. Isolates carrying these 
carbapenemase are mostly multidrug-resistant. Control strategies based on these 
genotypic distributions and antimicrobial susceptibilities of CPE isolates are 
required.
