BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute pancreatitis (AP) and SARS-CoV-2 
superinfection can occur in patients with AP during prolonged hospitalisation. 
Our objective was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 related AP and study the impact of 
SARS-CoV-2 superinfection on outcomes in AP.
METHODS: In this multicentre prospective study, all patients with AP and 
SARS-CoV-2 infection between August 2020 and February 2021 were divided into two 
groups: SARS-CoV-2-related AP and superadded SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients 
with AP. The two groups were compared with each other and the whole cohort was 
compared with a non-COVID AP cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 85 patients with SARS-CoV-2 and AP (SARS-CoV-2-related AP; 
n = 18 and AP with SARS-CoV-2 superadded infection; n = 67) were included during 
the study period. They had a higher mortality [28 (32.9%) vs. 44 (19.1%), aOR 
2.8 (95% CI, 1.5-5.3)] than 230 propensity matched non-COVID AP patients. 
Mortality in SARS-CoV-2 and AP patients was due to critical COVID. 
SARS-CoV-2-related- AP (n = 18) had a higher but statistically insignificant 
mortality than SARS-CoV-2 superinfection in AP [8/18 (44.4%) vs 20/67 (29.8%), 
p = 0.24]. On multivariable analysis, infection with SARS-CoV-2 (aHR 2.3; 95% 
CI, 1.43.7) was a predictor of in-hospital mortality in addition to organ 
failure (OF) in patients with AP.
CONCLUSION: Patients with AP and SARS-CoV-2 infection had a higher mortality 
than matched non-COVID AP patients which was largely attributable to the 
severity of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 related AP had higher OF and in-hospital 
mortality.
