PURPOSE: Tamoxifen showed individual differences in efficacy under different 
CYP2D6*10 genotypes. Our study evaluated the prognosis of tamoxifen or 
toremifene in hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer patients under 
different genotypes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CYP2D6*10 genotypes of HR-positive breast cancer patients 
were determined by Sanger sequencing, and all the patients were divided into 
tamoxifen group or toremifene group.
RESULTS: A total of 268 patients with HR-positive breast cancer were studied. 
The median follow-up time was 72.0 months (range, 5.0 to 88.0 months). Of these, 
88 (32.9%), 114 (42.5%), and 66 (24.6%) patients had C/C, C/T, and T/T 
genotypes, respectively. Among patients who received tamoxifen (n=176), the 
5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate in patients with C/C and C/T genotype 
was better than that in patients with T/T genotype, and the difference was 
statistically significant (p < 0.001 and p=0.030, respectively). In patients 
receiving toremifene, CYP2D6*10 genotype was not significantly associated with 
DFS (p=0.325). Regardless of genotypes, the 5-year DFS rate was higher in 
patients treated with toremifene than in patients with tamoxifen (91.3% vs. 
80.0%, p=0.011). Compared with tamoxifen, toremifene remained an independent 
prognostic marker of DFS in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.422; 
p=0.021). For all the 180 patients with CYP2D6*10 C/T and T/T genotypes, the 
5-year DFS rate was significantly higher in the toremifene group than in the 
tamoxifen group (90.8% vs. 70.1%, p=0.003).
CONCLUSION: Toremifene may be an alternative adjuvant endocrine therapy for 
patients with CYP2D6*10 mutant genotypes.
