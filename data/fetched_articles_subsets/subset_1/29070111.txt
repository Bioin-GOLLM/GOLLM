OBJECTIVE: To explore the molecular mechanism of resistance to imatinib in K562 
cells(K562-R) and the anti-proliferative effect of oridonin (OR), as well as its 
mechanism in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant K562 cells (K562-S and 
K562-R cells).
METHODS: The expression of p-Lyn in K562-S and K562-R cells were detected by 
Western blot. The anti-proliferative effect of OR in K562-S and K562-R cells was 
assayed by MTT, the morphological changes were examined with microscope, the 
cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, the expressions of BCL-2 and 
Akt/mTOR signaling pathway were detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: The over-expression of p-Lyn was detcected in K562-R cells, OR 
inhibited the proliferation of K562-S and K562-R cells and the value of IC50 was 
4.23±1.30, 4.97±2.23 µmol/L, respectively. The apoptotic rate was obviously 
enhanced after OR treatment for 24 h, compared with control group. OR 
down-regulated the expression of p-Lyn, mTOR signaling pathway and BCL-2 
protein.
CONCLUSION: Over-expression of p-Lyn may be involved in the mechanism of 
resistance to imatinib. OR can inhibit the proliferation of K562-S and K562-R 
cells through down-regulating p-Lyn, inhibiting mTOR signaling pathway and 
down-regulating expression of BCL-2 protein.
