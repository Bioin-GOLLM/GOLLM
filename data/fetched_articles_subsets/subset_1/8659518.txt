Paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis (PDC) is characterized by attacks of 
involuntary movements that last up to several hours and occur at rest both 
spontaneously and following caffeine or alcohol consumption. We analyzed a 
Polish-American kindred with autosomal dominant PDC and identified tight linkage 
between the disorder and microsatellite markers on chromosome 2q (maximum 
two-point LOD score 4.77; recombination fraction 0). Our results clearly 
establish the existence of a locus for autosomal dominant PDC on distal 
chromosome 2q. The fact that three other paroxysmal neurological disorders 
(periodic ataxia with myokymia and hypo- and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis) 
are due to mutation in ion-channel genes raises the possibility that PDC is also 
due to an ion-channel gene mutation. It is noteworthy that a cluster of 
sodium-channel genes is located on distal chromosome 2q, near the PDC locus. 
Identifying the PDC locus on chromosome 2q will facilitate discovery of the PDC 
gene and enable investigators to determine whether PDC is genetically 
homogeneous and whether other paroxysmal movement disorders are also genetically 
linked to the PDC locus.
