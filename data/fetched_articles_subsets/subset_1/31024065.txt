Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiencies are a group of heterogeneous conditions that 
respond to ubiquinone administration if treated soon after the onset of 
symptoms. However, this treatment is only partially effective due to its poor 
bioavailability. We tested whether vitamin K2, which was reported to act as a 
mitochondrial electron carrier in D. melanogaster, could mimic ubiquinone 
function in human CoQ10 deficient cell lines, and in yeast carrying mutations in 
genes required for coenzyme Q6 (CoQ6) biosynthesis. We found that vitamin K2, 
despite entering into mitochondria, restored neither electron flow in the 
respiratory chain, nor ATP synthesis. Conversely, coenzyme Q4 (CoQ4), an analog 
of CoQ10 with a shorter isoprenoid side chain, could efficiently substitute its 
function. Given its better solubility, CoQ4 could represent an alternative to 
CoQ10 in patients with both primary and secondary CoQ10 deficiencies.
