The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive loss of lives and economic hardship. 
In response, infectious disease experts and vaccine developers promptly 
responded by bringing forth candidate vaccines, some of which have been listed 
in the World Health Organization's Emergency Use Listing. Notwithstanding the 
diverse worldwide population genetics, the vaccines thus far developed are 
generic in nature for use worldwide. Differences in the human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) in different populations, variation of the T cell epitopes, and the 
propensity of SARS-CoV-2 genetic mutations left room for improvement of the 
vaccines. Here, we discussed the implications of COVID-19 vaccination and 
SARS-CoV-2 infection by taking into consideration SARS-CoV-2 mutations, T cell 
epitopes, risk factors, and current platforms of candidate vaccines based on the 
HLA types that are commonly present in Peninsular Malaysia Chinese, Indian, and 
Malay populations. The HLA types associated with protection against and 
susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified based on reported 
case-control and cohort studies. The relevance of including the non-spike 
SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the future COVID-19 vaccines is also highlighted. This 
review is meant to trigger researchers to acknowledge the importance of 
investigating the possible relationships between the HLA haplotype and the 
SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in different populations.
