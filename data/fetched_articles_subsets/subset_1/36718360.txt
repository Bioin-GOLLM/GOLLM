Dynamic changes in cell properties lead to intratumor heterogeneity; however, 
the mechanisms of nongenetic cellular plasticity remain elusive. When the fate 
of each cell from colorectal cancer organoids was tracked through a clonogenic 
growth assay, the cells showed a wide range of growth ability even within the 
clonal organoids, consisting of distinct subpopulations; the cells generating 
large spheroids and the cells generating small spheroids. The cells from the 
small spheroids generated only small spheroids (S-pattern), while the cells from 
the large spheroids generated both small and large spheroids (D-pattern), both 
of which were tumorigenic. Transition from the S-pattern to the D-pattern 
occurred by various extrinsic triggers, in which Notch signaling and Musashi-1 
played a key role. The S-pattern spheroids were resistant to chemotherapy and 
transited to the D-pattern upon drug treatment through Notch signaling. As the 
transition is linked to the drug resistance, it can be a therapeutic target.
