Anophthalmia and microphthalmia are among the most common ocular birth defects 
and a significant cause of congenital blindness. The etiology of anophthalmia 
and microphthalmia is diverse, with multiple genetic mutations associated with 
each of these conditions, along with potential environmental causes. Based on 
findings that mutations in the Rx/Rax homeobox genes in mice and fish lead to 
defects in retinal development and result in animal models of anophthalmia, we 
screened 75 individuals with anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia for mutations in 
the human RAX gene. We identified a single proband from this population who is a 
compound heterozygote for mutations in the RAX gene. This individual carries a 
truncated allele (Q147X) and a missense mutation (R192Q), both within the 
DNA-binding homeodomain of the RAX protein, and we have characterized the 
biochemical properties of these mutations in vitro. Parents and grandparents of 
the proband were found to be carriers without visible ocular defects, consistent 
with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This is the first report of 
genetic mutations in the human RAX gene.
