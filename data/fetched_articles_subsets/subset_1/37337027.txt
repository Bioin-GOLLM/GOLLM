Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive kidney damage with an increasing 
prevalence. Some evidence suggests that propolis as a novel antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory agent may have beneficial effects in 
CKD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of propolis on some 
kidney function parameters, pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB), glycemic 
status, quality of life, and blood pressure (BP) in patients with CKD. In this 
study, 44 patients with CKD were randomly assigned to receive propolis capsules 
at a dose of 250 mg daily or placebo for three months. Of 44 randomized 
individuals, 35 completed the trial. At the end of the intervention (end of 
month three), improvement in some dimensions of health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) (derived from Kidney Disease and Quality of Life Short-Form 
(KDQOL-[Formula: see text], v. 1.3) questionnaire) were significantly higher in 
the propolis group than the placebo group, even after adjustment for baseline 
values, present of diabetes, and age (P < 0.05). Like systolic and diastolic BP, 
changes in serum creatinine, 24-h urine volume and protein, fasting blood sugar 
(FBS), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), insulin, homeostasis model of assessment-insulin 
resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), and 
PAB did not differ significantly between the two groups (P > 0.05). No serious 
adverse events were reported throughout the study. Propolis supplementation may 
improve the HRQoL of CKD patients. More studies are needed to validate the 
adjunct use of propolis for metabolic control of CKD patients.
