Non-segmental vitiligo (NSV) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
progressive depigmentation of the skin. Oxidative stress (OS) has been proposed 
as one among the main principal causes in the development and establishment of a 
sustained autoimmune state in patients with NSV. However, the disease-associated 
OS biomarkers in clinical practice are not well studied. In this study, we found 
significantly reduced antioxidant enzymes [catalase (CAT) and superoxide 
dismutase (SOD)], total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and increased levels of 
lipid oxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidative DNA damage byproduct 
[8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)] in serum of NSV patients compared with 
healthy controls (HC). Serum TAC, MDA, and 8-OHdG levels were correlated with 
disease activity in all patients with NSV and much lower in patients receiving 
conventional treatment in the past 1 year compared to that without treatment. In 
addition, both serum MDA and 8-OHdG levels were significantly correlated with 
CXCL10 expression in patients with NSV. And the serum TAC, MDA, and 8-OHdG 
levels were also correlated with affected body surface area and Vitiligo Area 
Scoring Index score in patients with NSV. This study demonstrates dysregulated 
OS status in patients with NSV and provides the evidence that the serum TAC, 
MDA, and 8-OHdG have a capacity to indicate the activity and severity in 
patients with NSV.
