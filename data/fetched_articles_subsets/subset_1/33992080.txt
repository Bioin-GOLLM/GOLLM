BACKGROUND: The objective is to understand why physicians order tests or 
treatments in older adults contrary to published recommendations.
METHODS: Participants: Physicians above the median for ≥ 1 measures of overuse 
representing 3 Choosing Wisely topics.
MEASUREMENTS: Participants evaluated decisions in a semi-structured interview 
regarding: 1) Screening men aged ≥ 76 with prostate specific antigen 2) Ordering 
urine studies in women ≥ 65 without symptoms 3) Overtreating adults aged ≥ 75 
with insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications. Two investigators independently 
coded transcripts using qualitative analysis.
RESULTS: Nineteen interviews were conducted across the three topics resulting in 
four themes. First, physicians were aware and knowledgeable of guidelines. 
Second, perceived patient preference towards overuse influenced physician action 
even when physicians felt strongly that testing was not indicated. Third, 
physicians overestimated benefits of a test and underemphasized potential harms. 
Fourth, physicians were resistant to change when patients appeared to be doing 
well.
CONCLUSIONS: Though physicians expressed awareness to avoid overuse, deference 
to patient preferences and the tendency to distort the chance of benefit over 
harm influenced decisions to order testing. Approaches for decreasing 
unnecessary testing must account for perceived patient preferences, make the 
potential harms of overtesting salient, and address clinical inertia among 
patients who appear to be doing well.
