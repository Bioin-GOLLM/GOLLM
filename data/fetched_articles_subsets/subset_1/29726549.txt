Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family 
of secreted growth factors. BDNF signaling is known to exert both chronic, 
pro-survival effects related to gene expression and protein synthesis 
("canonical signaling"), and acute effects as a modulator of neurotransmission 
("non-canonical signaling"). BDNF has received a great deal of attention for its 
role in neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's Disease (HD), 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and Parkinson's Disease (PD) and has been extensively 
reviewed elsewhere in this regard (e.g., [1-6]). However aging-related changes 
in BDNF function and expression have been studied only rarely, with the majority 
of studies characterizing changes in structures such as the hippocampus and 
neocortex. In this review, we attempt to briefly summarize the extent of the 
existing literature on age-related BDNF changes, and discuss the relevance of 
these changes as a factor potentially impacting therapeutics in aged 
parkinsonian subjects.
