Numerous genes and molecular pathways are implicated in neurodegenerative 
proteinopathies, but their inter-relationships are poorly understood. We 
systematically mapped molecular pathways underlying the toxicity of 
alpha-synuclein (α-syn), a protein central to Parkinson's disease. Genome-wide 
screens in yeast identified 332 genes that impact α-syn toxicity. To "humanize" 
this molecular network, we developed a computational method, TransposeNet. This 
integrates a Steiner prize-collecting approach with homology assignment through 
sequence, structure, and interaction topology. TransposeNet linked α-syn to 
multiple parkinsonism genes and druggable targets through perturbed protein 
trafficking and ER quality control as well as mRNA metabolism and translation. A 
calcium signaling hub linked these processes to perturbed mitochondrial quality 
control and function, metal ion transport, transcriptional regulation, and 
signal transduction. Parkinsonism gene interaction profiles spatially opposed in 
the network (ATP13A2/PARK9 and VPS35/PARK17) were highly distinct, and network 
relationships for specific genes (LRRK2/PARK8, ATXN2, and EIF4G1/PARK18) were 
confirmed in patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. This 
cross-species platform connected diverse neurodegenerative genes to 
proteinopathy through specific mechanisms and may facilitate patient 
stratification for targeted therapy.
