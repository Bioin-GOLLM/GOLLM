Pf bacteriophage are temperate phages that infect the bacterium Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, a major cause of chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) and 
other settings. Pf and other temperate phages have evolved complex, mutualistic 
relationships with their bacterial hosts that impact both bacterial phenotypes 
and chronic infection. We and others have reported that Pf phages are a 
virulence factor that promote the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections in 
animal models and are associated with worse skin and lung infections in humans. 
Here we review the biology of Pf phage and what is known about its contributions 
to pathogenesis and clinical disease. First, we review the structure, genetics, 
and epidemiology of Pf phage. Next, we address the diverse and surprising ways 
that Pf phages contribute to P. aeruginosa phenotypes including effects on 
biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and motility. Then, we cover data 
indicating that Pf phages suppress mammalian immunity at sites of bacterial 
infection. Finally, we discuss recent literature implicating Pf in chronic P. 
aeruginosa infections in CF and other settings. Together, these reports suggest 
that Pf bacteriophage have direct effects on P. aeruginosa infections and that 
temperate phages are an exciting frontier in microbiology, immunology, and human 
health.
