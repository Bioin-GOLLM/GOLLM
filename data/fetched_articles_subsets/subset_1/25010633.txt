IMPORTANCE: To date, no consistency exists across studies that have evaluated 
the relationship between hepatic lipase gene (LIPC) rs10468017 variant and 
advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
OBJECTIVE: To summarize all relevant evidence for a relationship between LIPC 
variant and advanced AMD.
DATA SOURCES: The PubMed and Embase databases were searched for studies 
potentially eligible in any language published up to September 15, 2013.
STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies of 2 or more comparison groups that 
included patients with advanced AMD (choroidal neovascularization or geographic 
atrophy).
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Allele frequencies and genotype distributions of 
rs10468017 variant.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated 
under different genetic models using meta-analytic methods. A stratified 
analysis by advanced AMD subtypes and race/ethnicity was performed, as well as a 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Data from 10 case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis. 
The rs10468017 variant (Câ†’T) showed significant summary ORs of 0.81 (95% CI, 
0.75-0.88), 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.98), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.44-0.81) under the 
allelic (T vs C), heterozygous (TC vs CC), and homozygous (TT vs CC) models, 
respectively. Carrying at least 1 copy of the T allele decreased the risk of 
choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy by 20% (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 
0.74-0.87) and 29% (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59-0.86), respectively. The pooled OR 
for white race/ethnicity under an allelic model was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.87). 
The sensitivity analysis indicated the robustness of our findings, and no 
evidence of publication bias was observed in our meta-analysis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our meta-analysis indicates that LIPC rs10468017 
variant is associated with a reduced risk of advanced AMD. This finding may lead 
to insights regarding the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of AMD.
