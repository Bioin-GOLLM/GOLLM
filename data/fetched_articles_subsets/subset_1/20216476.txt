We have developed Pharmacogenomics And Cell database (PACdb), a results database 
that makes available relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms, gene 
expression, and cellular sensitivity to various drugs in cell-based models to 
help determine genetic variants associated with drug response. The current 
version also supports summary analysis on differentially expressed genes between 
the HapMap samples of European and African ancestry, as well as queries for 
summary information of correlations between gene expression and pharmacological 
phenotypes. At present, data generated on the following anticancer agents are 
included: carboplatin, cisplatin, etoposide, daunorubicin, and cytarabine 
(Ara-C). The database is also available to assist in the investigation of the 
effects of potential confounding variables (e.g. cell proliferation rate) in 
lymphoblastoid cell lines. PACdb will be regularly updated to include more drugs 
and new datasets (e.g. baseline microRNA levels). PACdb will be linked into 
PharmGKB to benefit the next wave of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic 
discovery.
