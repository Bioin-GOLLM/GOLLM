PURPOSE: To investigate the potential interaction between folate intake and the 
paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Q192R polymorphism with the risk of incident coronary heart 
disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
study, a population-based prospective cohort of cardiovascular disease in 15,792 
white and African-American subject.
METHODS: Race-stratified Cox proportional hazards models were performed to 
examine the interaction between folate intake and the PON1 Q192R polymorphism.
RESULTS: A significant inverse association between folate intake and risk of 
incident CHD among white subjects was found (hazard rate ratio, 1.30; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.09-1.56; P = .004; folate intake ≤155 μg vs ≥279 μg, 
reference group). An interaction effect was observed between the dominant 
genetic model and folate intake with regards to incident ischemic stroke in 
white subjects (hazard rate ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.99; and 
1.24 from 1st-4th quartile, respectively; P-trend = .05).
CONCLUSIONS: There was an interaction between folate intake and PON1 Q192 
polymorphism with regard to the risk of ischemic stroke in white subjects. 
Future studies should investigate the interaction between additional 
polymorphisms within the PON1 gene and genetic variants in other folate 
metabolizing genes with folate intake on the risk of incident CHD and stroke.
