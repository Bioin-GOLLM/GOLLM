Telomeres at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are essential for genome 
integrality and stability. In order to identify genes that sustain telomere 
maintenance independently of telomerase recruitment, we have exploited the 
phenotype of over-long telomeres in the cells that express Cdc13-Est2 fusion 
protein, and examined 195 strains, in which individual non-essential gene 
deletion causes telomere shortening. We have identified 24 genes whose deletion 
results in dramatic failure of Cdc13-Est2 function, including those encoding 
components of telomerase, Yku, KEOPS and NMD complexes, as well as quite a few 
whose functions are not obvious in telomerase activity regulation. We have 
characterized Swc4, a shared subunit of histone acetyltransferase NuA4 and 
chromatin remodeling SWR1 (SWR1-C) complexes, in telomere length regulation. 
Deletion of SWC4, but not other non-essential subunits of either NuA4 or SWR1-C, 
causes significant telomere shortening. Consistently, simultaneous disassembly 
of NuA4 and SWR1-C does not affect telomere length. Interestingly, inactivation 
of Swc4 in telomerase null cells accelerates both telomere shortening and 
senescence rates. Swc4 associates with telomeric DNA in vivo, suggesting a 
direct role of Swc4 at telomeres. Taken together, our work reveals a distinct 
role of Swc4 in telomere length regulation, separable from its canonical roles 
in both NuA4 and SWR1-C.
