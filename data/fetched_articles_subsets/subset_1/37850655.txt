Rdh54 is a conserved DNA translocase that participates in homologous 
recombination (HR), DNA checkpoint adaptation, and chromosome segregation. 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rdh54 is a known target of the Mec1/Rad53 signaling 
axis, which globally protects genome integrity during DNA metabolism. While 
phosphorylation of DNA repair proteins by Mec1/Rad53 is critical for HR 
progression little is known about how specific post translational modifications 
alter HR reactions. Phosphorylation of Rdh54 is linked to protection of genomic 
integrity but the consequences of modification remain poorly understood. Here, 
we demonstrate that phosphorylation of the Rdh54 C-terminus by the effector 
kinase Rad53 regulates Rdh54 clustering activity as revealed by single molecule 
imaging. This stems from phosphorylation dependent and independent interactions 
between Rdh54 and Rad53. Genetic assays reveal that loss of phosphorylation 
leads to phenotypic changes resulting in loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) outcomes. 
Our data highlight Rad53 as a key regulator of HR intermediates through 
activation and attenuation of Rdh54 motor function.
