2).

An alpha-chain variant hemoglobin was found in the hemolysate of a 21-year-old 
healthy male living in Bari (Puglia, Italy). Structural studies demonstrated a 
previously unreported amino acid substitution, alpha 2 45 (CD3) His leads to Gln 
beta 2, involving a distal heme contact. The new variant has been named Hb Bari. 
Its electrophoretic behavior was the same as for Hb A; it was stable to both 
isopropanol and heat denaturation and exhibited normal functional properties, 
with respect to whole blood and stripped hemolysate studies. The level of Hb 
Bari was about 20% in the observed carrier. No relative was available for 
further investigations.
