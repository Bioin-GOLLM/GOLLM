Although the regulation of epithelial morphogenesis is essential for the 
formation of tissues and organs in multicellular organisms, little is known 
about how signalling pathways control cell shape changes in space and time. In 
the Drosophila ovarian epithelium, the transition from a cuboidal to a squamous 
shape is accompanied by a wave of cell flattening and by the ordered remodelling 
of E-cadherin-based adherens junctions. We show that activation of the TGFβ 
pathway is crucial to determine the timing, the degree and the dynamic of cell 
flattening. Within these cells, TGFβ signalling controls cell-autonomously the 
formation of Actin filament and the localisation of activated Myosin II, 
indicating that internal forces are generated and used to remodel AJ and to 
promote cytoskeleton rearrangement. Our results also reveal that TGFβ signalling 
controls Notch activity and that its functions are partly executed through 
Notch. Thus, we demonstrate that the cells that undergo the cuboidal-to-squamous 
transition produce active cell-shaping mechanisms, rather than passively 
flattening in response to a global force generated by the growth of the 
underlying cells. Thus, our work on TGFβ signalling provides new insights into 
the mechanisms through which signal transduction cascades orchestrate cell shape 
changes to generate proper organ structure.
