The mitochondrion is a unique organelle with a diverse range of functions. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathological process in several 
neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria are mostly important for energy 
production; however, they also have roles in Ca2+ homeostasis, ROS production, 
and apoptosis. There are two major systems in place, which regulate 
mitochondrial integrity, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitophagy. These two 
processes remove damaged mitochondria from cells and protect the functional 
mitochondrial population. These quality control systems often become 
dysfunctional during neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and 
Alzheimer's disease, causing mitochondrial dysfunction and severe neurological 
symptoms.
