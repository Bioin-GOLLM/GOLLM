BACKGROUND: Intestinal lipid malabsorption, resulting from an impaired formation 
or secretion of chylomicrons and associated with severe hypobetalipoproteinemia 
(HBL), may be due to biallelic mutations in APOB (homozygous FHBL type-1), MTTP 
(abetalipoproteinemia), or SAR1B (chylomicron retention disease).
OBJECTIVE: We investigated four children, each born from consanguineous parents, 
presenting with steatorrhea, malnutrition, accumulation of lipids in 
enterocytes, and severe hypocholesterolemia with an apparent recessive 
transmission.
METHODS: We sequenced a panel of genes whose variants may be associated with 
HBL.
RESULTS: Case 1, a 9-month-old male, was found to be homozygous for a SAR1B 
variant (c.49 C>T), predicted to encode a truncated Sar1b protein devoid of 
function (p.Gln17*). Case 2, a 4-year-old male, was found to be homozygous for a 
SAR1B missense variant [c.409 G>C, p.(Asp137His)], which affects a highly 
conserved residue close to the Sar1b guanosine recognition site. Case 3, a 
6-year-old male, was found to be homozygous for an ∼6 kb deletion of the SAR1B 
gene, which eliminates exon 2; this deletion causes the loss of the ATG 
translation initiation codon in the SAR1B mRNA. The same homozygous mutation was 
found in an 11-month-old child (case 4) who was related to case 3.
CONCLUSIONS: We report 4 children with intestinal lipid malabsorption were found 
to have chylomicron retention disease due to 3 novel variants in the SAR1B gene.
