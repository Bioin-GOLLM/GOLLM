INTRODUCTION: In this study we report a novel mutation in the gap junction 
protein beta 1 (GJB1) gene of a Chinese X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 
(CMTX1) family, which has specific electrophysiological characteristics.
METHODS: Twenty members in the family were studied by clinical neurological 
examination and GJB1 gene mutation analysis, and 3 patients were studied 
electrophysiologically. The proband and his mother also underwent sural nerve 
biopsy.
RESULTS: All patients have the CMT phenotype, except for 2 asymptomatic 
carriers. Electrophysiological examinations showed non-uniform slowing of motor 
conduction velocities and partial motor conduction blocks and temporal 
dispersion. Sural nerve biopsy confirmed a predominantly demyelinating 
neuropathy, and an Asn2Lys mutation in the amino-terminal domain was found in 9 
members of this family, but not in 25 normal controls in the family.
CONCLUSIONS: This family represents a novel mutation in the GJB1 form of CMTX1. 
The mutation in the amino-terminus has an impact on the electrophysiological 
characteristics of the disease.
