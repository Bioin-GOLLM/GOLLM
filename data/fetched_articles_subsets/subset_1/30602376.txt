BACKGROUND: Nationally-representative household surveys are the standard 
approach to monitor access to and treatment with artemisinin-based combination 
therapy (ACT) among children under 5 years (U5), however these indicators are 
dependent on caregivers' recall of the treatment received.
METHODS: A prospective case-control study was performed in Mali to validate 
caregivers' recall of treatment received by U5s when seeking care for fever from 
rural and urban public health facilities, community health workers and urban 
private facilities. Clinician-recorded consultation details were the gold 
standard. Consenting caregivers were followed-up for interview at home within 
2 weeks using standard questions from Demographic and Health Surveys and Malaria 
Indicator Surveys.
RESULTS: Among 1602 caregivers, sensitivity of recalling that the child received 
a finger/heel prick was 91.5%, with specificity 85.7%. Caregivers' recall of a 
positive malaria test result had sensitivity 96.2% with specificity 59.7%. 
Irrespective of diagnostic test result, the sensitivity and specificity of 
caregivers' recalling a malaria diagnosis made by the health worker were 74.3% 
and 74.9%, respectively. Caregivers' recall of ACT being given had sensitivity 
of 43.2% and specificity 90.2%, while recall that any anti-malarial was given 
had sensitivity 59.0% and specificity 82.7%. Correcting caregivers' response of 
treatment received using a combination of a visual aid with photographs of 
common drugs for fever, prescription documents and retained packaging changed 
ACT recall sensitivity and specificity to 91.5% and 71.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that caregivers' responses during household 
surveys are valid when assessing if a child received a finger/heel prick during 
a consultation in the previous 2 weeks, and if the malaria test result was 
positive. Recall of ACT treatment received by U5s was poor when based on 
interview response only, but was substantially improved when incorporating 
visual aids, prescriptions and drug packaging review.
