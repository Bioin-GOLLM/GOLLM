Oxidative stress is a primary cause of cellular senescence and contributes to 
the etiology of numerous human diseases. Oxidative damage to telomeric DNA has 
been proposed to cause premature senescence by accelerating telomere shortening. 
Here, we tested this model directly using a precision chemoptogenetic tool to 
produce the common lesion 8-oxo-guanine (8oxoG) exclusively at telomeres in 
human fibroblasts and epithelial cells. A single induction of telomeric 8oxoG is 
sufficient to trigger multiple hallmarks of p53-dependent senescence. Telomeric 
8oxoG activates ATM and ATR signaling, and enriches for markers of telomere 
dysfunction in replicating, but not quiescent cells. Acute 8oxoG production 
fails to shorten telomeres, but rather generates fragile sites and mitotic DNA 
synthesis at telomeres, indicative of impaired replication. Based on our 
results, we propose that oxidative stress promotes rapid senescence by producing 
oxidative base lesions that drive replication-dependent telomere fragility and 
dysfunction in the absence of shortening and shelterin loss.
