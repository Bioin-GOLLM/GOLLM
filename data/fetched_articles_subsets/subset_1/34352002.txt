BACKGROUND: The diversity in the clinical course of COVID-19 has been related to 
differences in innate and adaptative immune response mechanisms. Natural killer 
(NK) lymphocytes are critical protagonists of human host defense against viral 
infections. It would seem that reduced circulating levels of these cells have an 
impact on COVID-19 progression and severity. Their activity is strongly 
regulated by killer-cell immuno-globulin-like receptors (KIRs) expressed on the 
NK cell surface. The present study's focus was to investigate the impact of KIRs 
and their HLA Class I ligands on SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: KIR gene frequencies, KIR haplotypes, KIR ligands and combinations of 
KIRs and their HLA Class I ligands were investigated in 396 Sardinian patients 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Comparisons were made between 2 groups of patients 
divided according to disease severity: 240 patients were symptomatic or 
paucisymptomatic (Group A), 156 hospitalized patients had severe disease (Group 
S). The immunogenetic characteristics of patients were also compared to a 
population group of 400 individuals from the same geographical areas.
RESULTS: Substantial differences were obtained for KIR genes, KIR haplotypes and 
KIR-HLA ligand combinations when comparing patients of Group S to those of Group 
A. Patients in Group S had a statistically significant higher frequency of the 
KIR A/A haplotype compared to patients in Group A [34.6% vs 23.8%, OR = 1.7 (95% 
CI 1.1-2.6); P = 0.02, Pc = 0.04]. Moreover, the KIR2DS2/HLA C1 combination was 
poorly represented in the group of patients with severe symptoms compared to 
those of the asymptomatic-paucisymptomatic group [33.3% vs 50.0%, OR = 0.5 (95% 
CI 0.3-0.8), P = 0.001, Pc = 0.002]. Multivariate analysis confirmed that, 
regardless of the sex and age of the patients, the latter genetic variable 
correlated with a less severe disease course [ORM = 0.4 (95% CI 0.3-0.7), PM = 
0.0005, PMC = 0.005].
CONCLUSIONS: The KIR2DS2/HLA C1 functional unit resulted to have a strong 
protective effect against the adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Combined to other 
well known factors such as advanced age, male sex and concomitant autoimmune 
diseases, this marker could prove to be highly informative of the disease course 
and thus enable the timely intervention needed to reduce the mortality 
associated with the severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, larger 
studies in other populations as well as experimental functional studies will be 
needed to confirm our findings and further pursue the effect of KIR receptors on 
NK cell immune-mediated response to SARS-Cov-2 infection.
