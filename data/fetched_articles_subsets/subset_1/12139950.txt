Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) results from mutations of phagocyte NADPH 
oxidase. Seventy percent are X-linked (X-)CGD with absent or defective 
gp91(phox) protein encoded by the CYBB gene. A subset of X-CGD patients 
demonstrates partial oxidase activity and/or varied levels of the gp91(phox) 
protein. Definitive genotypic diagnosis in these unusual patients requires 
mutation analysis. Typically, CYBB mutation analysis has relied on initial 
screening of cDNA by single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis, 
followed by selective sequencing. We report a fluorescent, automated method for 
CYBB mutation analysis using genomic DNA that provides more rapid and reliable 
results. Moreover, the use of genomic DNA in this approach allows mutation 
detection in the mRNA coding region, promoter/enhancer region, and intronic 
sequences flanking splice junctions and does not require mRNA preparation. The 
PCR conditions were optimized for each exon, including those with A+T-rich 
regions. We analyzed DNA from two unusual X-CGD patients and established the 
genetic basis for their phenotype. We also sequenced 100 normal X chromosomes to 
establish wild-type consensus sequences and identify polymorphisms.
