Males and females typically pursue divergent reproductive strategies and 
accordingly require different dietary compositions to maximise their fitness. 
Here we move from identifying sex-specific optimal diets to understanding the 
molecular mechanisms that underlie male and female responses to dietary 
variation in Drosophila melanogaster. We examine male and female gene expression 
on male-optimal (carbohydrate-rich) and female-optimal (protein-rich) diets. We 
find that the sexes share a large core of metabolic genes that are concordantly 
regulated in response to dietary composition. However, we also observe smaller 
sets of genes with divergent and opposing regulation, most notably in 
reproductive genes which are over-expressed on each sex's optimal diet. Our 
results suggest that nutrient sensing output emanating from a shared metabolic 
machinery are reversed in males and females, leading to opposing diet-dependent 
regulation of reproduction in males and females. Further analysis and 
experiments suggest that this reverse regulation occurs within the IIS/TOR 
network.
