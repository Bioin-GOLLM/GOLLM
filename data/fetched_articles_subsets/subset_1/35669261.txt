OBJECTIVES: Methamphetamine (METH) is a central nervous psychostimulant and one 
of the most frequently used illicit drugs. Numerous genetic loci that influence 
complex traits, including alcohol abuse, have been discovered; however, genetic 
analyses for METH dependence remain limited. An increased histone deacetylase 3 
(HDAC3) expression has been detected in Fos-positive neurons in the dorsomedial 
striatum following withdrawal after METH self-administration. Herein, we aimed 
to systematically investigate the contribution of HDAC3 to the vulnerability to 
METH dependence in a Han Chinese population.
METHODS: In total, we recruited 1,221 patients with METH dependence and 2,328 
age- and gender-matched controls. For genotyping, we selected 14 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within ± 3 kb regions of HDAC3. The 
associations between genotyped genetic polymorphisms and the vulnerability to 
METH dependence were examined by single marker- and haplotype-based methods 
using PLINK. The effects of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) on 
targeted gene expressions were investigated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression 
(GTEx) database.
RESULTS: The SNP rs14251 was identified as a significant association signal (χ2 
= 9.84, P = 0.0017). An increased risk of METH dependence was associated with 
the A allele (minor allele) of rs14251 [odds ratio (95% CI) = 1.25 (1.09-1.43)]. 
The results of in silico analyses suggested that SNP rs14251 could be a 
potential eQTL signal for FCHSD1, PCDHGB6, and RELL2, but not for HDAC3, in 
various human tissues.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that genetic polymorphism rs14251 located at 5q31.3 
was significantly associated with the vulnerability to METH dependence in Han 
Chinese population.
