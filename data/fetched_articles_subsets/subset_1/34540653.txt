OBJECTIVE: Accurate prediction of postoperative recurrence risk of gastric 
cancer (GC) is critical for individualized precision therapy. We aimed to 
investigate whether a computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics nomogram can be 
used as a tool for predicting the local recurrence (LR) of GC after radical 
resection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 342 patients (194 in the training cohort, 78 in the 
internal validation cohort, and 70 in the external validation cohort) with 
pathologically proven GC from two centers were included. Radiomics features were 
extracted from the preoperative CT imaging. The clinical model, radiomics 
signature, and radiomics nomogram, which incorporated the radiomics signature 
and independent clinical risk factors, were developed and verified. Furthermore, 
the performance of these three models was assessed by using the area under the 
curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and 
decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: The radiomics signature, which was comprised of two selected radiomics 
features, namely, contrast_GLCM and dissimilarity_GLCM, showed better 
performance than the clinical model in predicting the LR of GC, with AUC values 
of 0.83 in the training cohort, 0.84 in the internal validation cohort, and 0.73 
in the external cohort, respectively. By integrating the independent clinical 
risk factors (N stage, bile acid duodenogastric reflux and nodular or irregular 
outer layer of the gastric wall) into the radiomics signature, the radiomics 
nomogram achieved the highest accuracy in predicting LR, with AUC values of 
0.89, 0.89 and 0.80 in the three cohorts, respectively. DCA in the validation 
cohort showed that radiomics nomogram added more net benefit than the clinical 
model within the range of 0.01-0.98.
CONCLUSION: The CT-based radiomics nomogram has the potential to predict the LR 
of GC after radical resection.
