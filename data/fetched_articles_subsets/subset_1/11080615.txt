c-Abl preferentially phosphorylates peptide substrates that contain proline at 
the P+3 site (relative to the phosphorylated tyrosine). We previously described 
a mutant form of the Abl catalytic domain (Y569W) with altered substrate 
specificity at the P+3 position, as measured using synthetic peptides. In this 
study, we examine the phosphorylation of Crk, a protein substrate of Abl that is 
phosphorylated in the sequence Tyr221-Ala-Gln-Pro. In vitro, phosphorylation of 
Crk by Y569W Abl is greatly reduced relative to wild-type Abl. Overexpression of 
Y569W mutant Abl in 293T kidney cells produces a similar overall pattern of 
tyrosine phosphorylation as wild-type Abl, indicating that not all cellular 
proteins depend on Pro at P+3 for Abl recognition. However, phosphorylation of 
Crk by Y569W Abl in these cells is markedly reduced relative to wild-type Abl. A 
truncated form of Abl lacking the C-terminal polyproline region is not able to 
phosphorylate Crk in these assay conditions. Thus, proper phosphorylation of Crk 
by Abl depends not only on the interaction of the Crk SH3 domain with the Abl 
polyproline region, but also on the recognition of amino acids surrounding 
tyrosine by the Abl catalytic domain.
