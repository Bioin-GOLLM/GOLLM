The successful implementation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the 
treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains a flagship for molecularly 
targeted therapy in cancer. This focused review highlights critical elements of 
the underlying biology of CML and provides a summary of the molecular mechanisms 
that lead to TKI resistance: BCR-ABL1 mutation-based resistance and therapy 
escape through alternative pathway activation despite inhibition of BCR-ABL1 
tyrosine kinase activity. We direct attention to the most current manifestations 
of these issues, including emergence of pan-TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1 compound 
mutants, new strategies for identification and therapeutic targeting of 
alternative pathways, and the exciting, controversial topic of cessation of TKI 
therapy leading to durable treatment-free remissions for a subset of patients. 
Further gains in our understanding of the biology of Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) leukemia and mechanisms of resistance to 
BCR-ABL1 TKIs will benefit patients and also provide a blueprint for similar 
discovery in other cancers.
