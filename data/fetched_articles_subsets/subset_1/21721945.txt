Analysis of vertebrate genome sequences at the turn of the millennium revealed 
that a vastly larger repertoire of enzymes execute proteolytic cleavage 
reactions within the pericellular and extracellular environments than was 
anticipated from biochemical and molecular analysis. Most unexpected was the 
unveiling of an entire new family of structurally unique multidomain serine 
proteases that are anchored directly to the plasma membrane. Unlike secreted 
serine proteases, which function primarily in tissue repair, immunity, and 
nutrient uptake, these membrane-anchored serine proteases regulate fundamental 
cellular and developmental processes, including tissue morphogenesis, epithelial 
barrier function, ion and water transport, cellular iron export, and 
fertilization. Here the cellular and developmental biology of this fascinating 
new group of proteases is reviewed. Particularly highlighted is how the study of 
membrane-anchored serine proteases has expanded our knowledge of the range of 
physiological processes that require regulated proteolysis at the cell surface.
