NBS1 plays pivotal roles in maintaining genomic stability and cancer 
development. The exon variant rs1805794G>C (p.Glu185Gln) of NBS1 has been 
frequently studied in several association studies. However, the results were 
conflicting. Also, the function of this variant has never been well studied. In 
the current study, we performed a two centers case-control study and function 
assays to investigate the effect of the variant rs1805794G>C on lung cancer risk 
in Chinese, and a meta-analysis to summarize the data on the association between 
rs1805794G>C and cancer risk. We found that compared with the rs1805794GG 
genotype, the C genotypes (CG/CC) conferred a significantly increased risk of 
lung cancer in Chinese (OR=1.40, 95% CI=1.21-1.62) and interacted with medical 
ionizing radiation exposure on increasing cancer risk (Pinteraction=0.015). The 
lymphocyte cells from the C genotype individuals developed more chromatid breaks 
than those from the GG genotype carriers after the X-ray radiation (P=0.036). 
Moreover, the rs1805794C allele encoding p.185Gln attenuated NBS1's ability to 
repair DNA damage as the cell lines transfected with NBS1 cDNA expression vector 
carrying rs1805794C allele had significantly higher DNA breaks than those 
transfected with NBS1 cDNA expression vector carrying rs1805794G allele 
(P<0.05). The meta-analysis further confirmed the association between the 
variant rs1805794G>C and lung cancer risk, that compared with the GG genotype, 
the carriers of C genotypes had a 1.30-fold risk of cancer (95% CI=1.14-1.49, 
P=8.49×10(-5)). These findings suggest that the rs1805794G>C of NBS1 may be a 
functional genetic biomarker for lung cancer.
