Immunotherapy for cancer treatment has gained increased attention in recent 
years. Recently, our group reported the case of a patient with glioblastoma who 
underwent vaccination based on dendritic cells and experienced a strong Th1 
immune response together with near-complete tumor remission. Here we report the 
results of a phase I/II prospective, non-controlled clinical trial with 37 
patients harboring glioblastoma or grade 4 astrocytomas. At the time of first 
recurrence after surgery, patients began receiving monthly intradermal 
injections of allogenic DC-autologous tumor cell hybridomas. Overall survival, 
quality of life, and immunological profiles were assessed prospectively. 
Compared with patients in the Genomic Data Commons data bank, overall survival 
for vaccinated patients with glioblastoma was 27.6 ± 2.4 months (vs. 16.3 ± 0.7, 
log-rank p < 0.001, hazard ratio 0.53, 95%CI 0.36-0.78, p < 0.01), and it was 
59.5 ± 15.9 for vaccinated astrocytoma grade 4 patients (vs. 19.8 ± 2.5, 
log-rank p < 0.05, hazard ratio 0.18, 95%CI 0.05-0.62, p < 0.01). Furthermore, 
seven vaccinated patients (two IDH-1-mutated and five wild type) remain alive at 
the time of this report (overall survival 47.9 months, SD 21.1, range: 25.4-78.6 
months since diagnosis; and 34.2 months since recurrence, range: 17.8 to 40.7, 
SD 21.3). We believe that the data reported here can foster the improvement of 
treatment protocols for high-grade gliomas based on cellular immunotherapy.
