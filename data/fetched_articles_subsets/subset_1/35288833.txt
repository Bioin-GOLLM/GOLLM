BACKGROUND: Mutations in the ABCB4 gene are associated with failure of bile acid 
emulsification leading to cholestatic liver disease. Presentations range from 
progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) in childhood, to 
milder forms seen in adulthood.
AIMS: We sought to characterize adult disease with particular reference to 
histology which has been hitherto poorly defined.
METHODS: Four unrelated adults (three female, mean age 39 years) and three 
sisters presenting with cholestatic liver disease in adulthood, associated with 
variants in the ABCB4 gene, were identified. Clinical review and detailed 
blinded histopathological analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Two novel pathogenic ABCB4 variants were identified: c.620 T > G, 
p.(Ile207Arg) and c.2301dupT, p.(Thr768TyrfsTer26). Sub-phenotypes observed 
included low-phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis syndrome (LPAC), 
intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), drug-induced cholestasis, 
idiopathic adulthood ductopenia, and adult PFIC3. Of note, 5/7 had presented 
with gallstone complications (4 meeting LPAC definition) and 4/6 females had a 
history of ICP. Considerable overlap was observed phenotypically and liver 
transplantation was required in 3/7 of patients. Histologically, cases generally 
demonstrated ductopenia of the smaller tracts, mild non-ductocentric portal 
inflammation, bilirubinostasis, significant copper-associated protein 
deposition, and varying degrees of fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Adults with ABCB4 mutations may harbor a spectrum of cholestatic 
disease phenotypes and can progress to liver transplantation. We observed a 
distinct histological pattern which differs from classical biliary disease and 
describe two novel pathogenic ABCB4 variants. ABCB4 sequencing should be 
considered in patients with relevant cholestatic phenotypes and/or suggestive 
histology; accurate diagnosis can guide potential interventions to delay 
progression and inform family screening.
