Drug metabolizing genes are involved in the detoxification of chemical 
carcinogens. Polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing genes affect the risk of some 
forms of cancer. We analyzed six polymorphisms to evaluate their association 
with risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and to examine whether smoking 
modifies these associations in population-based study in Korea (713 cases and 
1,700 controls). The GSTP1 rs1695 AG and the combined AG/GG genotypes were 
associated with decreased risk of NHL (odds ratio (OR)(AG) = 0.67, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) = 0.55-0.82; OR(AG/GG) = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.54-0.80) and 
DLBCL (OR(AG) = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.49-0.82; OR(AG/GG) = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.50-0.82). 
For T-cell lymphoma, only the combined AG/GG genotype was associated with 
decreased risk (OR(AG/GG) = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.44-0.96). The CYP1A1 rs1048943 AG 
genotype and the combined AG/GG genotypes were associated with increased risk of 
NHL (OR(AG) = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.07-1.54; OR(AG/GG) = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06-1.51) 
and DLBCL (OR(AG) = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.04-1.66; OR(AG/GG) = 1.30, 95% CI = 
1.03-1.63), but not T-cell lymphoma. Smoking does not modify the association 
between these polymorphisms and NHL risk. Our data provide evidence that the 
GSTP1 rs1695 and the CYP1A1 rs1048943 genotypes affect the risk of NHL in Korea.
