Epigenetic modifications of the genome are generally stable in somatic cells of 
multicellular organisms. In germ cells and early embryos, however, epigenetic 
reprogramming occurs on a genome-wide scale, which includes demethylation of DNA 
and remodeling of histones and their modifications. The mechanisms of 
genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation, which involve modifications to 
5-methylcytosine and DNA repair, are being unraveled. Epigenetic reprogramming 
has important roles in imprinting, the natural as well as experimental 
acquisition of totipotency and pluripotency, control of transposons, and 
epigenetic inheritance across generations. Small RNAs and the inheritance of 
histone marks may also contribute to epigenetic inheritance and reprogramming. 
Reprogramming occurs in flowering plants and in mammals, and the similarities 
and differences illuminate developmental and reproductive strategies.
