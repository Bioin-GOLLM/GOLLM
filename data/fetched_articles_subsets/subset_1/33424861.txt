Inherited defects in MyD88 and IRAK4, two regulators in Toll-like receptor (TLR) 
signaling, are clinically highly relevant, but still incompletely understood. 
MyD88- and IRAK4-deficient patients are exceedingly susceptible to a narrow 
spectrum of pathogens, with ∼50% lethality in the first years of life. To better 
understand the underlying molecular and cellular characteristics that determine 
disease progression, we aimed at modeling the cellular response to pathogens in 
vitro. To this end, we determined the immunophenotype of monocytes and 
macrophages derived from MyD88- and IRAK4-deficient patients. We recognized that 
macrophages derived from both patients were particularly poorly activated by 
streptococci, indicating that both signaling intermediates are essential for the 
immune response to facultative pathogens. To characterize this defect in more 
detail, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of fibroblasts 
derived from an MyD88-deficient patient. The underlying genetic defect was 
corrected using Sleeping Beauty transposon vectors encoding either the long (L) 
or the short (S) MYD88 isoform, respectively. Macrophages derived from these 
iPSC lines (iMacs) expressed typical macrophage markers, stably produced either 
MyD88 isoform, and showed robust phagocytic activity. Notably, iMacs expressing 
MyD88-L, but not MyD88-S, exhibited similar responses to external stimuli, 
including cytokine release patterns, as compared to genetically normal iMacs. 
Thus, the two MyD88 isoforms assume distinct functions in signaling. In 
conclusion, iPSC technology, in combination with efficient myeloid 
differentiation protocols, provides a valuable and inexhaustible source of 
macrophages, which can be used for disease modeling. Moreover, iPSC-derived 
macrophages may eventually aid in stabilizing MyD88-deficient patients during 
pyogenic infections.
