BACKGROUND: Thousands of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are 
weakly associated with schizophrenia. It is likely that subsets of 
disease-associated SNPs are associated with distinct heritable 
disease-associated phenotypes. Therefore, we examined the shared genetic 
susceptibility modulating schizophrenia and brain volume.
METHODS: Odds ratios for genome-wide SNP data were calculated in the sample 
collected by the Psychiatric Genome-wide Association Study Consortium (8690 
schizophrenia patients and 11,831 control subjects, excluding subjects from the 
present study). These were used to calculate individual polygenic schizophrenia 
(risk) scores in an independent sample of 152 schizophrenia patients and 142 
healthy control subjects with available structural magnetic resonance imaging 
scans.
RESULTS: In the entire group, the polygenic schizophrenia score was 
significantly associated with total brain volume (R2 = .048, p = 1.6 × 10(-4)) 
and white matter volume (R2 = .051, p = 8.6 × 10(-5)) equally in patients and 
control subjects. The number of (independent) SNPs that substantially influenced 
both disease risk and white matter (n = 2020) was much smaller than the entire 
set of SNPs that modulated disease status (n = 14,751). From the set of 2020 
SNPs, a group of 186 SNPs showed most evidence for association with white matter 
volume and an explorative functional analysis showed that these SNPs were 
located in genes with neuronal functions.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a relatively small subset of 
schizophrenia genetic risk variants is related to the (normal) development of 
white matter. This, in turn, suggests that disruptions in white matter growth 
increase the susceptibility to develop schizophrenia.
