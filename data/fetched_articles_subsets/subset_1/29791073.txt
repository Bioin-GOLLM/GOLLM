AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, and histone acetylation is an epigenetic 
modification pattern that activates gene transcription. However, the genome-wide 
histone H3 acetylation in new-onset type 1 diabetes patients has not been well 
described. Accordingly, we aimed to unveil the genome-wide promoter acetylation 
profile in CD4+ T lymphocytes from type 1 diabetes patients, especially for 
those who are glutamate decarboxylase antibody-positive.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 12 patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes who 
were glutamate decarboxylase antibody-positive were enrolled, and 12 healthy 
individuals were recruited as controls. The global histone H3 acetylation level 
of CD4+ T lymphocytes from peripheral blood was detected by western blot, with 
chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to microarrays to characterize the promoter 
acetylation profile. Furthermore, we validated the results of particular genes 
from chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to microarrays by using chromatin 
immunoprecipitation quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and analyzed the 
transcription level by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Elevated global histone H3 acetylation level was observed in type 1 
diabetes patients, with 607 differentially acetylated genes identified between 
type 1 diabetes patients and controls by chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to 
microarrays. The hyperacetylated genes were enriched in biological processes 
involved in immune cell activation and inflammatory response. Gene-specific 
assessments showed that increased transcription of inducible T-cell costimulator 
was in concordance with the elevated acetylation in its gene promoter, along 
with positive correlation with glutamate decarboxylase antibody titer in type 1 
diabetes patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study generates a genome-wide histone acetylation 
profile specific to CD4+ T lymphocytes in type 1 diabetes patients who are 
glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody-positive, which is instrumental in 
improving our understanding of the epigenetic involvement in autoimmune 
diabetes.
