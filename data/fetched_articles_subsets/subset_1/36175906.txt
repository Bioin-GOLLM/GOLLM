INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a 
musculoskeletal disorder. Genetic and epigenetic changes in C-X3-C motif 
chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) may lead to disturbance in chondrocyte development 
and change the labrum dimensions, which indirectly result in hip joint 
instability. Considering the important role of this gene in cell migration, cell 
adhesion and bone and cartilage development, we aimed to evaluate the CX3CR1 
gene methylation in DDH pathogenesis.
METHODS: Our study comprised of forty-five DDH patients and forty-five healthy 
control subjects with healthy femoral neck cartilage. The healthy controls had 
total or hemiarthroplasty for the femoral neck fracture. Samples were collected 
from the femoral head (cartilage) of DDH patients and healthy controls. Genomic 
DNA was obtained from the samples, and DNA methylation of CX3CR1 gene was 
analyzed via metabisulfite method.
RESULTS: Methylation analysis reveals no significant differences in promoter of 
CX3CR1 gene in cartilage samples from DDH patients and healthy control subjects 
(P = 0.33).
CONCLUSION: Methylation status of CX3CR1 gene showed no significant difference 
between the patient and control groups. Our results indicate that DNA 
methylation may not modulate this gene in this disease and other epigenetic 
mechanisms such as non-coding RNAs and histone modifications could be 
implicated.
