A number of elegant studies exploring the consequences of expression of various 
mutant forms of p53 in mice have been published over the last years. The results 
and conclusions drawn from these studies often contradict results previously 
obtained in biochemical assays and cell biology studies, questioning their 
relevance for p53 function in vivo. Owing to the multitude of post-translational 
modifications imposed on p53, however, the in vivo validation of their relevance 
for proper protein function and tumour suppression is constantly lagging behind 
new biochemical discoveries. Nevertheless, mouse genetics presents again its 
enormous power. Despite being relatively slow and tedious, it has become 
indispensable for researchers to sort out the wheat from the chaff in an endless 
sea of publications on p53.
