Among all organs, the liver has a unique regeneration capability after 
sustaining injury or the loss of tissue that occurs mainly due to mitosis in the 
hepatocytes that are quiescent under normal conditions. Liver regeneration is 
induced through a cascade of various cytokines and growth factors, such as, 
tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, hepatocyte growth factor, and 
insulin-like growth factor, which activate nuclear factor ÎºB, signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3, and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase signaling 
pathways. We previously reported that platelets can play important roles in 
liver regeneration through a direct effect on hepatocytes and collaborative 
effects with the nonparenchymal cells of the liver, including Kupffer cells and 
liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which participate in liver regeneration 
through the production of various growth factors and cytokines. In this paper, 
the roles of platelets and nonparenchymal cells in liver regeneration, including 
the associated cytokines, growth factors, and signaling pathways, are described.
