The splicing factor SF3B1 is recurrently mutated in various tumors, including 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The impact of the hotspot mutation 
SF3B1K700E on the PDAC pathogenesis, however, remains elusive. Here, we 
demonstrate that Sf3b1K700E alone is insufficient to induce malignant 
transformation of the murine pancreas, but that it increases aggressiveness of 
PDAC if it co-occurs with mutated KRAS and p53. We further show that Sf3b1K700E 
already plays a role during early stages of pancreatic tumor progression and 
reduces the expression of TGF-β1-responsive epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) genes. Moreover, we found that SF3B1K700E confers resistance to 
TGF-β1-induced cell death in pancreatic organoids and cell lines, partly 
mediated through aberrant splicing of Map3k7. Overall, our findings demonstrate 
that SF3B1K700E acts as an oncogenic driver in PDAC, and suggest that it 
promotes the progression of early stage tumors by impeding the cellular response 
to tumor suppressive effects of TGF-β.
