BACKGROUND: Family history of prostate cancer is a well-recognized risk factor. 
Previous linkage studies have reported a putative prostate cancer susceptibility 
locus at chromosome 17q21-22. SPOP (Speckle-type POZ protein) maps to the 
17q21-22 candidate linkage region and is one of the most frequently mutated 
genes in sporadic prostate cancers.
METHODS: We performed targeted next generation sequencing to analyze 2009 exons 
from 202 genes in a candidate linkage region on chromosome 17q21-22 using 94 
unrelated familial prostate cancer cases from the University of Michigan 
Prostate Cancer Genetics Project (n=54) and Johns Hopkins University (n=40) 
including the exons and UTRs of SPOP.
RESULTS: We identified a novel SPOP missense mutation (N296I) in a man with 
prostate cancer diagnosed at age 43. This mutation completely segregates with 
prostate cancer affection status among the men in this family. The N296I 
mutation resides within the evolutionarily conserved Bric-a-brac, Tramtrack, 
Broad-complex (BTB) domain, involved in recruiting targets to Cul3 for 
degradation. Analysis of the prostate tumor from this individual verified the 
presence of heterozygous N296I as well as an ERG fusion.
CONCLUSIONS: We have discovered a novel mutation in SPOP that tracks with 
prostate cancer within a family and is predicted to be deleterious. Taken 
together, our results implicate SPOP as a candidate gene for hereditary prostate 
cancer.
