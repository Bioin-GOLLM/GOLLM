PTP1B, a non-transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase that has long been 
studied as a negative regulator of insulin and leptin signaling, has received 
renewed attention as an unexpected positive factor in tumorigenesis. Here, we 
highlight how views of this enzyme have evolved from regarding it as a simple 
metabolic off-switch to a more complex view of PTP1B as an enzyme that can play 
both negative and positive roles in diverse signaling pathways. These dual 
characteristics make PTP1B a particularly attractive therapeutic target for 
diabetes, obesity, and perhaps breast cancer.
