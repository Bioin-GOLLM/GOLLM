BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In the CENTRAL trial context, we found diverse liver fat 
dynamics in response to different dietary interventions. Epigenetic mechanisms 
may contribute to the intraindividual variation. Moreover, genetic factors are 
involved in developing nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD), a disease 
reflected by an increase in intrahepatic fat (IHF). In this exploratory 
analysis, we primarily aimed to examine the effect of lifestyle interventions on 
DNA-methylation of NAFLD related genes associated with IHF.
METHODS: For 120 participants from the CENTRAL trial, an 18-month regimen of 
either low-fat (LF) or Mediterranean-low carbohydrate (MED/LC) diets, with or 
without physical activity (PA+/PA-), was instructed. Magnetic resonance imaging 
was used to measure IHF%, which was analysed for association with CpG specific 
DNA-methylation levels of 41 selected candidate genes. Single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms known to be associated with NAFLD within the studied genes were 
genotyped by TaqMan assays.
RESULTS: At baseline, participants (92% men; body mass index = 30.2 kg/m2 ) had 
mean IHF of 10.7% (59% NAFLD). Baseline-IHF% was inversely correlated with 
DNA-methylation at individual CpGs within AC074286.1, CRACR2A, A2MP1, FARP1 
(P < .05 for all multivariate models). FARP1 rs9584805 showed association with 
IHF, with the prevalence of NAFLD and baseline methylation level of the CpG site 
(cg00071727) associated with IHF%. Following 18-month lifestyle intervention, 
differential DNA-methylation patterns were observed between diets at cg14335324 
annotated to A2MP1 (P = .04, LF vs. MED/LC), and differential DNA-methylation 
between PA groups within AC074286.1, CRACR2A, and FARP1 CpGs (P < .05 for all, 
PA-vs. PA+).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests epigenetic markers for IHF and potential 
epigenetic remodeling after long-term lifestyle interventions.
