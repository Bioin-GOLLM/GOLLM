Cornelia de Lange syndrome is a multisystem developmental disorder typically 
caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cohesin loader NIPBL. The 
associated phenotype is generally assumed to be the consequence of aberrant 
transcriptional regulation. Recently, we identified a missense mutation in BRD4 
associated with a Cornelia de Lange-like syndrome that reduces BRD4 binding to 
acetylated histones. Here we show that, although this mutation reduces 
BRD4-occupancy at enhancers it does not affect transcription of the pluripotency 
network in mouse embryonic stem cells. Rather, it delays the cell cycle, 
increases DNA damage signalling, and perturbs regulation of DNA repair in mutant 
cells. This uncovers a role for BRD4 in DNA repair pathway choice. Furthermore, 
we find evidence of a similar increase in DNA damage signalling in cells derived 
from NIPBL-deficient individuals, suggesting that defective DNA damage 
signalling and repair is also a feature of typical Cornelia de Lange syndrome.
