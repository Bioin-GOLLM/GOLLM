Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal tumors, and reliable detection of 
early-stage pancreatic cancer and risk diseases for pancreatic cancer is 
essential to improve the prognosis. As 260 genes were previously reported to be 
upregulated in invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas (IDACP) cells, 
quantification of the corresponding proteins in plasma might be useful for IDACP 
diagnosis. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to identify plasma 
biomarkers for early detection of IDACP by using two proteomics strategies: 
antibody-based proteomics and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics. Among the 260 genes, we focused on 130 encoded 
proteins with known function for which antibodies were available. Twenty-three 
proteins showed values of the area under the curve (AUC) of more than 0.8 in 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of reverse-phase protein array 
(RPPA) data of IDACP patients compared with healthy controls, and these proteins 
were selected as biomarker candidates. We then used our high-throughput selected 
reaction monitoring or multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) methodology, 
together with an automated sample preparation system, micro LC and auto analysis 
system, to quantify these candidate proteins in plasma from healthy controls and 
IDACP patients on a large scale. The results revealed that insulin-like growth 
factor-binding protein (IGFBP)2 and IGFBP3 have the ability to discriminate 
IDACP patients at an early stage from healthy controls, and IGFBP2 appeared to 
be increased in risk diseases of pancreatic malignancy, such as intraductal 
papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Furthermore, diagnosis of IDACP using the 
combination of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), IGFBP2 and IGFBP3 is 
significantly more effective than CA19-9 alone. This suggests that IGFBP2 and 
IGFBP3 may serve as compensatory biomarkers for CA19-9. Early diagnosis with 
this marker combination may improve the prognosis of IDACP patients.
