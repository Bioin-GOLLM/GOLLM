We report a family showing autosomal-dominant segregation of upper- and 
lower-eyelid distichiasis (double row of eyelashes) in seven affected relatives 
over three generations, in addition to below-knee lymphedema of pubertal onset 
(lymphoedema proecox) in three. Two children had cleft palate in addition to 
distichiasis, but without the previously reported association with the 
Pierre-Robin sequence. Other ophthalmologic anomalies included divergent 
strabismus and early-onset myopia. This family was found to be completely linked 
to markers mapped to 16q24.3 and thereby proposed to be allelic to the 
distichiasis-lymphedema syndrome (DL, MIM 153400), although pterygium colli, 
congenital heart disease, or facial dysmorphism were not features found here. As 
FOXC2/FKLH14 mutations were found to underlie DL and diverse hereditary 
lymphedema conditions, this gene was examined by sequence analysis. An 
out-of-frame deletion (914-921del) was identified and found to segregate with 
the disease, further highlighting the phenotypic heterogeneity of lymphedema 
conditions linked to FOXC2 truncating mutations. Whether such heterogeneity is 
related to genotype-phenotype correlation, a hypothesis not primarily supported 
by the apparent loss-of-function mechanism of the mutations, or governed by 
modifying genes, remains to be determined.
