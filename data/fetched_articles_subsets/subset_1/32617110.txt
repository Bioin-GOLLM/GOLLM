BACKGROUND: Clinical comprehensive decision-making of diabetic ulcers includes 
curative effect evaluation and curative effect prediction. Nevertheless, there 
are few studies on the prediction of diabetic ulcers.
METHODS: Set pair analysis (SPA) was used to assess the curative effect 
evaluation, and therapeutic effect was evaluated by connection degree (CD). The 
higher-order Markov chain-SPA curative effect prediction model was established 
to predict the future curative effect development. The predicted results with 
higher-order Markov chain-SPA and traditional first-order Markov-SPA model were 
compared with the actual results of the patients to verify the effectiveness of 
prediction.
RESULTS: The connection degree of index levels I and II of 15 patients with 
diabetic ulcers after traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment increased 
with time, while that of index levels IV and V decreased, indicating that the 
curative effect tends to improve. The higher-order Markov chain-SPA model was 
used to predict the curative effect. The results showed that the relative errors 
were fewer than the traditional first-order Markov-SPA model.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that a method of SPA combined with 
higher-order Markov-SPA is relatively effective and can be applied to the 
clinical prediction of diabetic ulcers, which has higher accuracy than 
traditional first-order curative effect prediction model.
