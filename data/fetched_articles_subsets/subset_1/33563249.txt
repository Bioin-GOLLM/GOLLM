BACKGROUND: Cognitive functions represent useful endophenotypes to identify the 
association between genetic variants and schizophrenia. In this sense, the NR4A2 
gene has been implicated in schizophrenia and cognition in different animal 
models and clinical trials. We hypothesized that the NR4A2 gene is associated 
with working memory performance in schizophrenia. This study aimed to analyze 
two variants and the expression levels of the NR4A2 gene with susceptibility to 
schizophrenia, as well as to evaluate whether possession of NR4A2 variants 
influence the possible correlation between gene expression and working memory 
performance in schizophrenia.
METHODS: The current study included 187 schizophrenia patients and 227 controls 
genotyped for two of the most studied NR4A2 genetic variants in neurological and 
neuropsychiatric diseases. Genotyping was performed using High Resolution Melt 
and sequencing techniques. In addition, mRNA expression of NR4A2 was performed 
in peripheral mononuclear cells of 112 patients and 118 controls. A group of 
these participants, 54 patients and 87 controls, performed the working memory 
index of the WAIS III test.
RESULTS: Both genotypic frequencies of the two variants and expression levels of 
the NR4A2 gene showed no significant difference when in patients versus 
controls. However, patients homozygous for the rs34884856 promoter variant 
showed a positive correlation between expression levels and auditory working 
memory.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding suggested that changes in expression levels of the 
NR4A2 gene could be associated with working memory in schizophrenia depending on 
patients' genotype in a sample from a Mexican population.
