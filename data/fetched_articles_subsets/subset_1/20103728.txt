Ornithine decarboxylase has a relatively long history as a target for cancer 
chemoprevention and chemotherapy. Plym Forshell et al. report new evidence 
(beginning on p. 140 in this issue of the journal) indicating that spermidine 
synthase, a fellow enzyme of ornithine decarboxylase in polyamine metabolism, is 
transactivated in part by the MYC gene and is a potential target for 
chemoprevention of B-cell lymphomas.
