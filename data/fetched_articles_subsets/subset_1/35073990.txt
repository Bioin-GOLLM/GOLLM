OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of genetic variants and clinical 
characteristics on the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to 
construct and verify a prediction model of GDM in early pregnancy.
METHODS: Four hundred seventy five women with GDM and 487 women without, as a 
control, were included to construct the prediction model of GDM in early 
pregnancy. Both groups had complete genotyping results and clinical data. They 
were randomly divided into a trial cohort (70%) and a test cohort (30%). Then, 
the model validation cohort, including 985 pregnant women, was used for the 
external validation of the GDM early pregnancy prediction model.
RESULTS: We found maternal age, gravidity, parity, BMI and family history of 
diabetes were significantly associated with GDM (OR > 1; P < 0.001), and 
assisted reproduction was a critical risk factor for GDM (OR = 1.553, 
P = 0.055). MTNR1B rs10830963, C2CD4A/B rs1436953 and rs7172432, CMIP rs16955379 
were significantly correlated with the incidence of GDM (AOR > 1, P < 0.05). 
Therefore, these four genetic susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
and six clinical characteristics were included in the construction of the GDM 
early pregnancy prediction model. In the trial cohort, a predictive model of GDM 
in early pregnancy was constructed, in which genetic risk score was 
independently associated with GDM (AOR = 2.061, P < 0.001) and was the most 
effective predictor with the exception of family history of diabetes. The 
ROC-AUC of the prediction model was 0.727 (95% CI 0.690-0.765), and the 
sensitivity and specificity were 69.9% and 64.0%, respectively. The predictive 
power was also verified in the test cohort and the validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the genetic variants and clinical characteristics, this 
study developed and verified the early pregnancy prediction model of GDM. This 
model can help screen out the population at high-risk for GDM in early 
pregnancy, and lifestyle interventions can be performed for them in a timely 
manner in early pregnancy.
