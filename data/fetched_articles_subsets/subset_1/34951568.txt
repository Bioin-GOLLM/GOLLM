We performed an annotation of 35 mutations in the spike protein of the 
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Our analysis of the mutations indicates that Omicron 
has gained prominent immune evasion and potential for enhanced transmissibility. 
Previous modeling study has revealed that continued evolution in both immune 
evasion and enhanced transmissibility by SARS-CoV-2 would compromise vaccines as 
tools for the pandemic control. To combat the future variants of SARS-CoV-2, the 
world needs novel antiviral drugs that are effective at curb viral spreading 
without introducing additional selective pressure towards resistant variants.
