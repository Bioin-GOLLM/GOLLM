Most patients with oncogene-driven advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
demonstrate recurrence because of the developing targeted therapy resistance. In 
this retrospective study, we assessed the efficacy of surgical local 
consolidative treatment by analyzing the operative outcomes and genetic data in 
44 patients who underwent pulmonary resection for stage IIIB/C-IV NSCLC after 
targeted therapy. The initial mutations were in the EGFR (n = 32), ALK (n = 11), 
and ROS1 (n = 1) genes. The median interval from the initiation of tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy immediately before the surgery to the actual 
operation was 9.8 months. Operative mortality was absent. Four patients showed 
complete remission. The median follow-up period after TKI therapy initiation was 
23.1 months. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the 2-year 
failure-free survival and overall survival rates from the initiation of TKI were 
70.8% and 95.0%, respectively. During the follow-up period, two patients died 
and 15 suffered from disease progression. Among the 32 patients with EGFR 
mutations, 12 showed additional mutations, and targeted agents were replaced in 
nine patients after the operation. We conclude that pulmonary resection for 
advanced NSCLC after targeted therapy is feasible, and the surgical specimens 
could be used for planning further targeted therapy.
