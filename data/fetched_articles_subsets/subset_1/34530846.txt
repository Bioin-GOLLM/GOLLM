BACKGROUND: Sphingosine Kinase (SphK) that catalyzes sphingosine (Sph) to 
sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), plays a key role in both sphingolipid metabolism 
and cellular signaling. While SphK has been implicated in type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), it is unexplored in humans. Herein, we investigated whether 
circulating SphK-related metabolites are associated with T2DM incidence in an 
established prospective cohort.
METHODS: Levels of SphK-related sphingolipid metabolites, including Sph, S1P, 
dihydrosphingosine (dhSph) and dihydro-S1P (dhS1P) in serum were measured by 
targeted-lipidomic analyses. By accessing to an established prospective cohort 
that involves a total of 2486 non-diabetic adults at baseline, 100 subjects who 
developed T2DM after a mean follow-up of 4.2-years, along with 100 control 
subjects matched strictly with age, sex, BMI and fasting glucose, were randomly 
enrolled for the present study.
RESULTS: Comparison with the control group, medians of serum dhS1P and 
dhS1P/dhSph ratio at baseline were elevated significantly prior to the onset of 
T2DM. Each SD increment of dhS1P and dhS1P/dhSph ratio was associated with 53.5% 
and 54.1% increased risk of incident diabetes, respectively. The predictive 
effect of circulating dhS1P and dhS1P/dhSph ratio on T2DM incidence was 
independent of conventional risk factors in multivariate regression models. 
Furthermore, combination of serum dhS1P and dhS1P/dhSph ratio with conventional 
clinical indices significantly improved the accuracy of T2DM prediction (AUROC, 
0.726), especially for normoglycemic subjects (AUROC, 0.859).
CONCLUSION: Circulating levels of dhS1P and dhS1P/dhSph ratio are strongly 
associated with increased risk of T2DM, and could serve as a useful biomarker 
for prediction of incident T2DM in normoglycemic populations.
