A diverse range of loss-of-function variants in the SPINK1 gene (encoding 
pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor) has been identified in patients with 
chronic pancreatitis (CP). The haplotype harboring the SPINK1 c.101A>G 
(p.Asn34Ser or N34S) variant (rs17107315:T>C) is one of the most important 
heritable risk factors for CP as a consequence of its relatively high prevalence 
worldwide (population allele frequency ≈ 1%) and its considerable effect size 
(odds ratio ≈ 11). The causal variant responsible for this haplotype has been 
intensively investigated over the past two decades. The different hypotheses 
tested addressed whether the N34S missense variant has a direct impact on enzyme 
structure and function, whether c.101A>G could affect pre-mRNA splicing or mRNA 
stability, and whether another variant in linkage disequilibrium with c.101A>G 
might be responsible for the observed association with CP. Having reviewed the 
currently available genetic and experimental data, we conclude that c.-4141G>T 
(rs142703147:C>A), which disrupts a PTF1L-binding site within an evolutionarily 
conserved HNF1A-PTF1L cis-regulatory module located ∼4 kb upstream of the SPINK1 
promoter, can be designated as the causal variant beyond reasonable doubt. This 
case illustrates the difficulties inherent in determining the identity of the 
causal variant underlying an initially identified disease association.
