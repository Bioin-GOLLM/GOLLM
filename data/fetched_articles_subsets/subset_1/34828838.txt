The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of selenium yeast and 
phytobiotic on the storage capacity, selected quality parameters of meat and 
content of selenium in muscles obtained from broilers. In the experiment, 1440 
male broiler chickens (Ross 308) were randomly assigned to four research groups: 
group received no additive (G1), group received a supplement of 0.3 mg Se (as 
sodium selenite)/kg of feed mixture (G2), group received 0.2 g phytobiotic and 
0.3 mg Se as 0.1 g selenium yeast per 1 kg of feed mixture (G3) and group 
received 0.3 mg Se as 0.1 g selenium yeast per 1 kg of feed mixture (G4). 
Measurement of pH, determination of water retention capacity, degree of 
advancement of oxidative changes and selenium content in muscles were performed. 
Samples of chickens' breast and thigh muscles were microbiologically analyzed. 
The additives significantly influenced the level of oxidation in muscles and the 
incorporation of selenium. The meat of chickens receiving organic selenium was 
characterized by significantly lower dynamics of oxidative changes. The studies 
carried out showed that selenium in organic form had better absorption.
