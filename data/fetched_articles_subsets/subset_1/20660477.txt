We compared here 80 different sequences containing four tracts of three guanines 
with loops of variable length (between 1 and 15 bases for unmodified sequences, 
up to 30 for fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides). All sequences were capable 
of forming stable quadruplexes, with T(m) above physiological temperature in 
most cases. Unsurprisingly, the melting temperature was systematically lower in 
sodium than in potassium but the difference between both ionic conditions varied 
between 1 and >39°C (average difference: 18.3°C). Depending on the sequence 
context, and especially for G4 sequences involving two very short loops, the 
third one may be very long without compromising the stability of the quadruplex. 
A strong inverse correlation between total loop length and T(m) was found in 
K(+): each added base leads to a 2°C drop in T(m) or ∼0.3 kcal/mol loss in ΔG°. 
The trend was less clear in Na(+), with a longer than expected optimal loop 
length (up to 5 nt). This study will therefore extend the sequence repertoire of 
quadruplex-prone sequences, arguing for a modification of the widely used 
consensus (maximal loop size of 7 bases).
