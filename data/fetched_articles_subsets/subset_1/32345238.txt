BACKGROUND: Since the inception of newborn screening programs in China in the 
1990s, pregnancy among patients with inherited, metabolic disorders has become 
more common. This study explores the management and outcomes of planned, 
full-term pregnancies in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU).
METHOD: Married patients with PKU from 2012 to 2017 were enrolled to receive 
prenatal counseling and regular health assessments. Study-related assessments 
included the timing of Phe-restricted diets, maternal weight gain, gestational 
age, pregnancy complications, and blood Phe concentrations (both pre-conception 
and during pregnancy), obstetrical data, and offspring outcomes(e.g. 
anthropomorphic measurements and developmental quotients [DQs]).
RESULTS: A total of six offspring were successfully delivered. The mean ± SD 
(range) age of the mother at delivery was 26.3 ± 4.7 (range: 21.1-32.5) years. 
The mean duration of Phe control before pregnancy was 5.5 ± 1.3(range: 3.1-6.5) 
months. During pregnancy, the proportion of blood Phe concentrations within the 
clinically-recommended target range (120-360 μmol/L) ranged from 63.2-83.5%. Low 
birth weight (< 2500 g) offspring occurred in two women who experienced 
suboptimal metabolic control. In addition, offspring DQ was related to the 
proportion of blood Phe levels per trimester that were within the recommended 
range (r = 0.886, p = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of women in China with PKU who successfully 
gave birth to clinically healthy babies. Infant outcomes were related to 
maternal blood Phe management prior to and during pregnancy. In maternal PKU 
patients with poor compliance to dietary treatment, sapropterin dihydrochloride 
(6R-BH4) may be an option to improve the management of blood Phe levels.
