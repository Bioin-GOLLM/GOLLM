Evaluation of usefulness of single-strand conformation polymorphism method for 
rapid detection of rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Tesić J, Lepsanović Z, Mirović V.

The aim was to evaluate the Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism method as a 
potential tool for rapid detection of rifampicin-resistant strains by the use of 
39 rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in Serbia. 
SSCP analysis on acrylamide gel detected 56.4% of the rifampicin-resistant M. 
tuberculosis strains and showed the inability to detect one of the most frequent 
mutations, TCG-->TTG mutation in codon 531 of the rpoB gene, which was shown by 
automated sequencing.
