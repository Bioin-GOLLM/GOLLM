Causes of autism are still unknown. Some studies have shown that autism might be 
associated with metabolic abnormalities in the folate/homocysteine pathway, 
which is involved in DNA methylation, thus altering gene expression. The 
association between the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T 
polymorphisms and the risk of autism is still controversial and ambiguous. The 
purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism 
on the autism risk in the Chinese Han population. A population-based 
case-control study was conducted in 186 children with autism and 186 controls. 
The MTHFR C677T polymorphisms were determined by using a polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The frequency of 
genotype MTHFR 677TT in children with autism (16.1%) was significantly higher 
(odds ratio [OR]=2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07, 3.89; p=0.03] than 
those in controls (8.6%). When stratifying by select-item scores on the Autism 
Diagnostic Interview-Revised, it was found that children with current 
overactivity had a significantly higher frequency of the MTHFR 677TT genotype 
(OR=2.77, 95% CI=1.17, 6.60; p=0.02) than those without. This study suggested 
that MTHFR C677T is a risk factor of autism in Chinese Han children.
