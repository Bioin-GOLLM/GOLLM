Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61) is an extracellular matrix protein 
involved in the transduction of growth factor and hormone signaling that is 
frequently altered in expression in several types of cancers. In prostate cancer 
(PCa), Cyr61 is highly expressed in organ-confined disease. Further, Cyr61 
expression levels are associated with a lower risk of disease recurrence, and 
can be quantitatively measured in the serum. Considered together, these results 
indicate that Cyr61 is a potential and clinically useful tissue, as well as 
serum-based biomarker for differentiating lethal and non-lethal PCa.
