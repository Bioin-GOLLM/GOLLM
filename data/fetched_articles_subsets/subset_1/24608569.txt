BACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism caused by activating mutations of the thyrotropin 
receptor gene (TSHR) is rare in the pediatric population.
METHODS: We found a Japanese family with hyperthyroidism without autoantibody. 
DNA sequence analysis of TSHR was undertaken in this family. The functional 
consequences for the Gs-adenylyl cyclase and Gq/11-phospholipase C signaling 
pathways and cell surface expression of receptors were determined in vitro using 
transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells.
RESULTS: We identified a heterozygous mutation (M453R) in exon 10 of TSHR. In 
this family, this mutation was found in all individuals who exhibited 
hyperthyroidism. The results showed that this mutation resulted in constitutive 
activation of the Gs-adenylyl cyclase system. However, this mutation also caused 
a reduction in the activation capacity of the Gq/11-phospholipase C pathway, 
compared with the wild type.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that the M453R mutation is the cause of nonautoimmune 
hyperthyroidism.
