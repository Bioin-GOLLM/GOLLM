While G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have received considerable attention 
for their biological activity in a diversity of physiological functions and have 
become targets for therapeutic intervention in many diseases, the function of 
the cell adhesion subfamily of GPCRs remains poorly understood. Within this 
group, the family of brain angiogenesis inhibitor molecules (BAI1-3) has become 
increasingly appreciated for their diverse roles in biology and disease. In 
particular, recent findings suggest emerging roles for BAI1 in the regulation of 
phenomena including phagocytosis, synaptogenesis, and the inhibition of tumor 
growth and angiogenesis via the processing of its extracellular domain into 
secreted vasculostatins. Here we summarize the known biological features of the 
BAI proteins, including their structure, proteolysis events, and interacting 
partners, and their recently identified ability to regulate certain signaling 
pathways. Finally, we discuss the potential of the BAIs as therapeutics or 
targets for diseases as varied as cancer, stroke, and schizophrenia.
