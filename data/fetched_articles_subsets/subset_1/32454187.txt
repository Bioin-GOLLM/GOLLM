BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 cases continue to rise globally, evidence from large 
randomized controlled trials is still lacking. Currently, numerous trials 
testing potential treatment and preventative options are being undertaken all 
over the world.
OBJECTIVES: We summarized all registered clinical trials examining treatment and 
prevention options for COVID-19. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the 
retrieved studies.
DATA SOURCES: Clinicaltrials.gov, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and the 
European Union Clinical Trials Register were systematically searched.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Registered clinical trials examining treatment 
and/or prevention options for COVID-19 were included. No language, country or 
study design restrictions were applied. We excluded withdrawn or cancelled 
studies and trials not reporting therapeutic or preventative strategies for 
COVID-19.
PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: No restrictions in terms of participants' age 
and medical background or type of intervention were enforced.
METHODS: The registries were searched using the term 'coronavirus' or 'COVID-19' 
from their inception until 26 March 2020. Additional manual search of the 
registries was also performed. Eligible studies were summarized and tabulated. 
Interventional trials were methodologically analysed, excluding expanded access 
studies and trials testing traditional Chinese medicine.
RESULTS: In total, 309 trials evaluating therapeutic management options, 23 
studies assessing preventive strategies and three studies examining both were 
retrieved. Finally, 214 studies were methodologically reviewed. Interventional 
treatment studies were mostly randomized (n = 150/198, 76%) and open label 
(n = 73/198, 37%) with a median number of planned inclusions of 90 
(interquartile range 40-200). Major categories of interventions that are 
currently being investigated are discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: Numerous clinical trials have been registered since the onset of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Summarized data on these trials will assist physicians 
and researchers to promote patient care and guide future research efforts for 
COVID-19 pandemic containment.
