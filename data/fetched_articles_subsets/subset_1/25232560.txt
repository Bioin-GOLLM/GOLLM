OBJECTIVES: Chromosome 9p21 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a 
susceptibility variant for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the primary 
prevention setting. However, it is controversial whether this SNP is also 
associated with recurrent myocardial infarction (ReMI) in the secondary 
prevention setting. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of 
chromosome 9p21 SNP on ReMI in patients receiving secondary prevention 
programmes after AMI.
DESIGN: A prospective observational study.
SETTING: Osaka Acute Coronary Insufficiency Study (OACIS) in Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: 2022 patients from the OACIS database.
INTERVENTIONS: Genotyping of the 9p21 rs1333049 variant.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: ReMI event after survival discharge for 1 year.
RESULTS: A total of 43 ReMI occurred during the 1 year follow-up period. 
Although the rs1333049 C allele had an increased susceptibility to their first 
AMI in an additive model when compared with 1373 healthy controls (OR 1.20, 95% 
CI 1.09 to 1.33, p=2.3*10(−4)), patients with the CC genotype had a lower 
incidence of ReMI at 1 year after discharge of AMI (log-rank p=0.005). The 
adjusted HR of the CC genotype as compared with the CG/GG genotypes was 0.20 
(0.06 to 0.65, p=0.007). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the association 
between the rs1333049 CC genotype and a lower incidence of 1 year ReMI was 
common to all subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Homozygous carriers of the rs1333049 C allele on chromosome 9p21 
showed a reduced risk of 1 year ReMI in the contemporary percutaneous coronary 
intervention era, although the C allele had conferred susceptibility to their 
first AMI.
