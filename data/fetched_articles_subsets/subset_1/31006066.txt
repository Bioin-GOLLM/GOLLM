Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the 
formation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, fibrillary 
tangles of intraneuronal tau and microglial activation are major pathological 
hallmarks. One of the key molecules involved in microglial activation is 
galectin-3 (gal3), and we demonstrate here for the first time a key role of gal3 
in AD pathology. Gal3 was highly upregulated in the brains of AD patients and 
5xFAD (familial Alzheimer's disease) mice and found specifically expressed in 
microglia associated with Aβ plaques. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 
LGALS3 gene, which encodes gal3, were associated with an increased risk of AD. 
Gal3 deletion in 5xFAD mice attenuated microglia-associated immune responses, 
particularly those associated with TLR and TREM2/DAP12 signaling. In vitro data 
revealed that gal3 was required to fully activate microglia in response to 
fibrillar Aβ. Gal3 deletion decreased the Aβ burden in 5xFAD mice and improved 
cognitive behavior. Interestingly, a single intrahippocampal injection of gal3 
along with Aβ monomers in WT mice was sufficient to induce the formation of 
long-lasting (2 months) insoluble Aβ aggregates, which were absent when gal3 was 
lacking. High-resolution microscopy (stochastic optical reconstruction 
microscopy) demonstrated close colocalization of gal3 and TREM2 in microglial 
processes, and a direct interaction was shown by a fluorescence anisotropy assay 
involving the gal3 carbohydrate recognition domain. Furthermore, gal3 was shown 
to stimulate TREM2-DAP12 signaling in a reporter cell line. Overall, our data 
support the view that gal3 inhibition may be a potential pharmacological 
approach to counteract AD.
