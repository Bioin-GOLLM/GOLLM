Plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine-181 (P-tau181) demonstrates promise as an 
accessible blood-based biomarker specific to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), with 
levels recently demonstrating high predictive accuracy for AD-relevant 
pathology. The genetic underpinnings of P-tau181 levels, however, remain 
elusive. This study presents the first genome-wide association study of plasma 
P-tau181 in a total sample of 1153 participants from 2 independent cohorts. No 
loci, other than those within the APOE genomic region (lead variant = rs429358, 
beta = 0.32, p =8.44 × 10-25) demonstrated association with P-tau181 at 
genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10-08), though rs60872856 on chromosome 2 came 
close (beta = -0.28, p = 3.23 × 10-07, nearest gene=CYTIP). As the APOE ε4 
allele is already a well-established genetic variant associated with AD, this 
study found no evidence of novel genetic associations relevant to plasma 
P-tau181, though presents rs60872856 on chromosome 2 as a candidate locus to be 
further evaluated in future larger size GWAS.
