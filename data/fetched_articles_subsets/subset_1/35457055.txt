Collagen I-based foams were modified with calcined or noncalcined hydroxyapatite 
or calcium phosphates with various particle sizes and pores to monitor their 
effect on cell interactions. The resulting scaffolds thus differed in grain 
size, changing from nanoscale to microscopic, and possessed diverse 
morphological characteristics and resorbability. The materials' biological 
action was shown on human bone marrow MSCs. Scaffold morphology was identified 
by SEM. Using viability test, qPCR, and immunohistochemical staining, we 
evaluated the biological activity of all of the materials. This study revealed 
that the most suitable scaffold composition for osteogenesis induction is 
collagen I foam with calcined hydroxyapatite with a pore size of 360 ± 130 µm 
and mean particle size of 0.130 µm. The expression of osteogenic markers RunX2 
and ColI mRNA was promoted, and a strong synthesis of extracellular protein 
osteocalcin was observed. ColI/calcined HAP scaffold showed significant 
osteogenic potential, and can be easily manipulated and tailored to the defect 
size, which gives it great potential for bone tissue engineering applications.
