OBJECTIVE: To report Avellino corneal dystrophy and underlying R124H mutation in 
2 families of Indian origin.
METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected in EDTA for genomic DNA isolation from 
leukocytes of all affected and unaffected individuals. Amplification of 
transforming growth factor beta-induced gene (TGFBI) using polymerase chain 
reaction followed by direct sequencing was carried out to determine the 
mutations underlying the disorder. A detailed clinical evaluation was undertaken 
to establish a genotype-phenotype correlation.
RESULTS: R124H mutation resulting from a missense heterozygous substitution of G 
to A at nucleotide 418 of TGFBI was detected in all affected members of the 2 
families. The affected individuals were clinically diagnosed as having granular 
corneal dystrophy. Histopathological examination was not done because no 
surgical intervention was undertaken.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of Avellino corneal 
dystrophy from India clinically diagnosed as granular corneal dystrophy, 
emphasizing that TGFBI screening is essential for the accurate diagnosis and 
classification of corneal dystrophies.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Molecular genetics is a useful tool for accurate diagnosis 
and classification of corneal dystrophies. All autosomal dominant stromal 
dystrophies should be screened for underlying mutations in TGFBI because the 
clinical and phenotypic appearance is variable.
