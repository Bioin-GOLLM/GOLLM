The historically dominant SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant and the currently dominant 
Omicron variants carry a T492I substitution within the non-structural protein 4 
(NSP4). Based on in silico analyses, we hypothesized that the T492I mutation 
increases viral transmissibility and adaptability, which we confirmed with 
competition experiments in hamster and human airway tissue culture models. 
Furthermore, we showed that the T492I mutation increases the replication 
capacity and infectiveness of the virus and improves its ability to evade host 
immune responses. Mechanistically, the T492I mutation increases the cleavage 
efficiency of the viral main protease NSP5 by enhancing enzyme-substrate 
binding, which increases production of nearly all non-structural proteins 
processed by NSP5. Importantly, the T492I mutation suppresses 
viral-RNA-associated chemokine production in monocytic macrophages, which may 
contribute to the attenuated pathogenicity of Omicron variants. Our results 
highlight the importance of NSP4 adaptation in the evolutionary dynamics of 
SARS-CoV-2.
