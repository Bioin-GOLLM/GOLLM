Immunohistochemistry has recently been validated for the detection of the 
BRAFV600E mutation across a range of tumor types. In colorectal carcinoma, the 
presence of the BRAFV600E mutation can be used to virtually exclude Lynch 
syndrome in mismatch repair-deficient tumors. In mismatch repair-proficient 
tumors, BRAFV600E mutation assessed by molecular methods has been proposed as a 
poor prognostic factor. We investigated whether combined BRAFV600E and mismatch 
repair status assessment by immunohistochemistry alone can be used as a 
prognostic marker in the routine clinical setting. We performed 
immunohistochemistry for BRAFV600E, MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 on 1426 
consecutive unselected colorectal carcinomas. Ninety-one (6.4%) carcinomas were 
mismatch repair-proficient and BRAFV600E mutant, and these tumors demonstrated a 
significantly worse 5-year survival of 49.7% compared with mismatch 
repair-proficient BRAF wild type (74.1% of tumors, 65.4% survival), mismatch 
repair-deficient BRAFV600E mutant (12.9% of tumors, 70.1% survival), and 
mismatch repair-deficient BRAF wild type (6.6% of tumors, 73.6% survival). The 
poor survival was confirmed by univariate analysis (P<0.01) but fell away in 
multivariate analysis (P=0.68) because of the strong effect of tumor stage and 
age on overall survival. We conclude that in addition to its utility in 
screening for Lynch syndrome, reflex BRAFV600E and mismatch repair assessment by 
immunohistochemistry can be used as a powerful predictor of all-cause survival.
