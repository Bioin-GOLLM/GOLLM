Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA may represent a viable diagnostic alternative to 
respiratory RNA levels, which rapidly decline after infection. Quantitative PCR 
with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) reference assays exhibit poor performance 
with plasma, probably reflecting the dilution and degradation of viral RNA 
released into the circulation, but these issues could be addressed by analysing 
viral RNA packaged into extracellular vesicles. Here we describe an assay 
approach in which extracellular vesicles directly captured from plasma are fused 
with reagent-loaded liposomes to sensitively amplify and detect a SARS-CoV-2 
gene target. This approach accurately identified patients with COVID-19, 
including challenging cases missed by RT-qPCR. SARS-CoV-2-positive extracellular 
vesicles were detected at day 1 post-infection, and plateaued from day 6 to the 
day 28 endpoint in a non-human primate model, while signal durations for 
20-60 days were observed in young children. This nanotechnology approach uses a 
non-infectious sample and extends virus detection windows, offering a tool to 
support COVID-19 diagnosis in patients without SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectable in the 
respiratory tract.
