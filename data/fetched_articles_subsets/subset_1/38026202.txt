The C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) expressed on immune cells supports 
inflammatory responses by directing cells to the inflammation site. CCR5 is also 
a major coreceptor for macrophage tropic human immunodeficiency viruses 
(R5-HIV-1) and its variants can confer protection from HIV infection, making it 
an ideal candidate to target for therapy. We developed a stepwise protocol that 
differentiates induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from individuals 
homozygous for the CCR5Δ32 variant and healthy volunteers into myeloid lineage 
induced monocytes (iMono) and macrophages (iMac). By characterizing iMono and 
iMac against their primary counterparts, we demonstrated that CCR5Δ32 homozygous 
cells are endowed with similar pluripotent potential for self-renewal and 
differentiation as iPSC lines generated from non-variant individuals while also 
showing resistance to HIV infection. In conclusion, these cells are a platform 
to investigate CCR5 pathophysiology in HIV-positive and negative individuals and 
to help develop novel therapies.
