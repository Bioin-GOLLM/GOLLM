Intestinal CD4(+) T cells are essential mediators of immune homeostasis and 
inflammation. Multiple subsets of CD4(+) T cells have been described in the 
intestine, which represents an important site for the generation and regulation 
of cells involved in immune responses both within and outside of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Recent advances have furthered our understanding of the 
biology of such cells in the intestine. Appreciation of the functional roles for 
effector and regulatory populations in health and disease has revealed potential 
translational targets for the treatment of intestinal diseases, including 
inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, the role of dietary and 
microbiota-derived factors in shaping the intestinal CD4(+) T-cell compartment 
is becoming increasingly understood. Here, we review recent advances in 
understanding the multifaceted roles of CD4(+) T cells in intestinal immunity.
