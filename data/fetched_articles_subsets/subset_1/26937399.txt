Hunter disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by 
progressive storage of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and multi-organ impairment. The 
central nervous system (CNS) is involved in at least 50% of cases. Since 2006, 
the enzymatic replacement therapy (ERT) is available but with no effect on the 
cognitive impairment, as the present formulation does not cross the blood-brain 
barrier. Here we report the outcome of 17 Hunter patients treated in a single 
center. Most of them (11) started ERT in 2006, 3 had started it earlier in 2004, 
enrolled in the phase III trial, and 3 after 2006, as soon as the diagnosis was 
made. The liver and spleen sizes and urinary GAGs significantly decreased and 
normalized throughout the treatment. Heart parameters improved, in particular 
the left ventricular mass index/m(2) decreased significantly. Amelioration of 
hearing was seen in many patients. Joint range of motion improved in all 
patients. However, no improvement on respiratory function, eye, skeletal and CNS 
disease was found. The developmental quotient of patients with a CNS involvement 
showed a fast decline. These patients were no more testable after 6 years of age 
and, albeit the benefits drawn from ERT, their quality of life worsened 
throughout the years. The whole group of patients showed a consistent residual 
disease burden mainly represented by persistent skeletal disease and frequent 
need of surgery. This study suggests that early diagnosis and treatment and 
other different therapies which are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, might 
in the future improve the MPS II outcome.
