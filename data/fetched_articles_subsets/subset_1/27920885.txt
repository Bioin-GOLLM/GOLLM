BACKGROUND: As a drug target and an antigenic agent, HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 PR) 
is at the center of attention for designing anti-AIDS inhibitors and diagnostic 
tests. In previous studies, the production of the recombinant protease has been 
faced with several difficulties; therefore, the aims of this study were the easy 
production, purification of the soluble form of protease in E. coli and 
investigation of its immunoreactivity.
METHODS: Protease coding region was isolated from the serum of an infected 
individual, amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into PTZ57R using TA-cloning. 
Protease coding frame was isolated by PCR and cloned in pET102/D. TOPO 
expression vector and cloned protease was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. 
coli) BL21. Produced recombinant protein was purified by affinity Ni-NTA column 
and protein concentration was checked by BCA protein assay kit. Subsequently, 
immunoreactivity of recombinant protease (rPR) was assayed by Western blotting 
and ELISA.
RESULTS: Cloning of the HIV protease by TOPO cloning system in pET102/D.TOPO was 
confirmed with PCR and sequencing. The concentration range of purified 
recombinant protein was 85 to 100 Î¼g/ml. Immunogenicity of rPR was confirmed by 
Western blotting and ELISA.
CONCLUSION: Soluble production of recombinant HIV-1 protease (HIV-1 rPR) was 
performed successfully. This recombinant protein disclosed 86% specificity and 
90% sensitivity in immunoassay tests.
