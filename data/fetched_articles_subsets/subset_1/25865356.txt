The plasticity of differentiated cells in adult tissues undergoing repair is an 
area of intense research. Pulmonary alveolar type II cells produce surfactant 
and function as progenitors in the adult, demonstrating both self-renewal and 
differentiation into gas exchanging type I cells. In vivo, type I cells are 
thought to be terminally differentiated and their ability to give rise to 
alternate lineages has not been reported. Here we show that Hopx becomes 
restricted to type I cells during development. However, unexpectedly, 
lineage-labelled Hopx(+) cells both proliferate and generate type II cells 
during adult alveolar regrowth following partial pneumonectomy. In clonal 3D 
culture, single Hopx(+) type I cells generate organoids composed of type I and 
type II cells, a process modulated by TGFÎ² signalling. These findings 
demonstrate unanticipated plasticity of type I cells and a bidirectional lineage 
relationship between distinct differentiated alveolar epithelial cell types in 
vivo and in single-cell culture.
