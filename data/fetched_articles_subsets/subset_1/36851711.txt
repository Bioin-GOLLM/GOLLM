BACKGROUND: Incarcerated women are a minority in the Italian prison population. 
The lack of prevention and awareness of HIV infection and the lack of access to 
treatment make the treatment path difficult.
METHODS: we conducted a multi-center study including incarcerated women living 
with HIV (WLWH).
RESULTS: The study included 85 WLWH with a mean age of 41.7 ± 8.7 years, and 
58.8% (50/85) of them were Italian. Principally, HIV transmission was related to 
sexual intercourse, 47% of all patients were PWIDs, and 62.5% of them were on 
opioid substitution therapy (OST). Overall, 56.4% of the included patients had a 
CD4+ cell count of >500 cells/mmc. Among the participants, 92.9% were on 
antiretroviral therapy, 87.3% had treatment before incarceration, and 83.5% were 
virologically suppressed. Among the 13 non-virally-suppressed patients, 53.8% 
were unaware of their serological status before incarceration and had started 
HAART but were still not virologically suppressed; 46.2% (6/13) had a lack of 
compliance or had suspended the treatment before incarceration and restarted it 
after admission. All patients with chronic hepatitis C underwent treatment with 
direct-acting antivirals and reached a sustained virological response.
CONCLUSIONS: the detention of these women could represent an occasion for the 
patients' healthcare provision and use, and the creation of a gender-specific 
network can be an effective strategy for reaching this population.
