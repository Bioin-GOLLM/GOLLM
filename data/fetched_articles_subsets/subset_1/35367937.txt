BACKGROUND: The most studied genetic polymorphisms associated with gastric 
cancer (GC) risk are located in protein-coding genes. However, the localization 
of these in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has not been fully studied. We aim to 
investigate the associations of Long non-coding RNA macrophage migration 
inhibitory factor antisense RNA1(Lnc-MIF-AS1) five polymorphisms (rs755622, 
rs17004044, rs2070767, rs1007889, rs2000468) with the risk and prognosis of GC.
METHODS: A total of 844 GC patients and 871 controls were included in the study. 
Genotyping was carried out using polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection 
reaction (PCR-LDR) technology. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) generated from unconditional logistic regression, were applied to quantify 
the effects of MIF-AS1 gene SNPs on GC risk. Log-rank test and Cox regression 
analysis were fitted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) to quantify the effects of 
MIF-AS1 gene SNPs on GC prognosis.
RESULTS: Significant associations were identified between MIF-AS1 rs17004044 
variants and GC group in the codominant, dominant and additive models (OR = 
2.843, P = 0.010; OR = 1.370, P = 0.004; and OR = 1.386; P = 0.001). In 
addition, association between rs17004044 variants and survival of GC was 
extremely observed (TC HR = 2.02 (1.21-3.37) P = 0.007, CC HR = 5.61 
(2.12-14.83), P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: MIF-AS1 polymorphism rs17004044 contributes to increased 
predisposition and prognosis to GC.
