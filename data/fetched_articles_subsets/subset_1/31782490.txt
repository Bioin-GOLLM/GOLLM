Epigenetic information in the mammalian oocyte has the potential to be 
transmitted to the next generation and influence gene expression; this occurs 
naturally in the case of imprinted genes. Therefore, it is important to 
understand how epigenetic information is patterned during oocyte development and 
growth. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of de novo DNA 
methylation mechanisms in the oocyte: how a distinctive gene-body methylation 
pattern is created, and the extent to which the DNA methylation machinery reads 
chromatin states. Recent epigenomic studies building on advances in ultra-low 
input chromatin profiling methods, coupled with genetic studies, have started to 
allow a detailed interrogation of the interplay between DNA methylation 
establishment and chromatin states; however, a full mechanistic description 
awaits.
