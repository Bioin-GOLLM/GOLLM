MAP1LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, LC3) is a key 
component of the autophagy pathway, contributing to both cargo selection and 
autophagosome formation in the cytoplasm. Emerging evidence suggests that 
nuclear forms of LC3 are also functionally important; however, the mechanisms 
that facilitate the nuclear targeting and trafficking of LC3 between the nucleus 
and cytoplasm under steady-state conditions are poorly understood. In this 
study, we examine how residues known to regulate the interactions between LC3 
and other proteins or RNA (F52 L53, R68-R70 and G120) contribute to its nuclear 
targeting, nucleocytoplasmic transport and association with nucleoli and other 
nuclear components. We find that residues F52 L53 and R68-70, but not G120, 
regulate targeting of LC3 to the nucleus, its rates of nucleocytoplasmic 
transport and the apparent sizes of LC3-associated complexes in the nucleus 
inferred from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements. We 
also show that LC3 is enriched in nucleoli and its triple arginine motif is 
especially important for nucleolar targeting. Finally, we identify a series of 
candidate nuclear LC3-interacting proteins using mass spectrometry, including 
MAP1B, tubulin and several 40S ribosomal proteins. These findings suggest LC3 is 
retained in the nucleus in association with high-molecular weight complexes that 
continuously scan the nucleolus.
