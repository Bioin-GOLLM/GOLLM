INTRODUCTION: Loss-of-function variants in both copies of the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF); 
however, there is evidence that reduction in CFTR function due to the presence 
of one deleterious variant can have clinical consequences. Here, we hypothesise 
that CFTR variants in individuals with a history of smoking are associated with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and related phenotypes.
METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing was performed through the National Heart, Lung, 
and Blood Institute TOPMed (TransOmics in Precision Medicine) programme in 8597 
subjects from the COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of COPD) study, an 
observational study of current and former smokers. We extracted clinically 
annotated CFTR variants and performed single-variant and variant-set testing for 
COPD and related phenotypes. Replication was performed in 2118 subjects from the 
ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate 
Endpoints) study.
RESULTS: We identified 301 coding variants within the CFTR gene boundary: 147 of 
these have been reported in individuals with CF, including 36 CF-causing 
variants. We found that CF-causing variants were associated with chronic 
bronchitis in variant-set testing in COPDGene (one-sided p=0.0025; OR 1.53) and 
in meta-analysis of COPDGene and ECLIPSE (one-sided p=0.0060; OR 1.52). 
Single-variant testing revealed that the F508del variant was associated with 
chronic bronchitis in COPDGene (one-sided p=0.015; OR 1.47). In addition, we 
identified 32 subjects with two or more CFTR variants on separate alleles and 
these subjects were enriched for COPD cases (p=0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smokers who carry one deleterious CFTR variant have 
higher rates of chronic bronchitis, while presence of two CFTR variants may be 
associated with COPD. These results indicate that genetically mediated reduction 
in CFTR function contributes to COPD related phenotypes, in particular chronic 
bronchitis.
