INTRODUCTION: Age of onset modifiers are of considerable importance in 
Alzheimer's and related dementias. Arboleda-Valesquez et al., reporting on a 
single PSEN1 subject, suggested that homozygosity for the Christchurch variant 
of APOE could represent such a modifier.
METHODS: We studied APOE Christchurch and Kloth-VS genotypes of five dementia 
age of onset outliers who carried their families' pathogenic variant, but were 
asymptomatic at ages beyond the families' average age of onset.
RESULTS: Four age of onset outliers with PSEN1/2 and MAPT mutations did not 
carry the Christchurch variant and a fifth individual was also determined to not 
be homozygous for this variant. Among them, only one subject (APOE ε3/ε3) 
carries the Klotho-VS heterozygous genotype.
DISCUSSION: From a small but informative sample of five age of onset outliers we 
show that neither the APOE Christchurch nor the Klotho-VS variant is a common 
age of onset modifier for three genetic forms of dementia. Larger studies of 
this association and further research is required to identify additional genetic 
modifiers.
