Regulatory B cells restrict immune and inflammatory responses across a number of 
contexts. This capacity is mediated primarily through the production of IL-10. 
Here we demonstrate that the induction of a regulatory program in human B cells 
is dependent on a metabolic priming event driven by cholesterol metabolism. 
Synthesis of the metabolic intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) is 
required to specifically drive IL-10 production, and to attenuate Th1 responses. 
Furthermore, GGPP-dependent protein modifications control signaling through 
PI3Kδ-AKT-GSK3, which in turn promote BLIMP1-dependent IL-10 production. 
Inherited gene mutations in cholesterol metabolism result in a severe 
autoinflammatory syndrome termed mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD). Consistent 
with our findings, B cells from MKD patients induce poor IL-10 responses and are 
functionally impaired. Moreover, metabolic supplementation with GGPP is able to 
reverse this defect. Collectively, our data define cholesterol metabolism as an 
integral metabolic pathway for the optimal functioning of human IL-10 producing 
regulatory B cells.
