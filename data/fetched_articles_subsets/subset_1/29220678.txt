Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSDs) are autosomal-recessive disorders that are 
caused by defects in peroxisome biogenesis due to bi-allelic mutations in any of 
13 different PEX genes. Here, we identified seven unrelated individuals affected 
with an apparent dominant ZSD in whom a heterozygous mutant PEX6 allele 
(c.2578C>T [p.Arg860Trp]) was overrepresented due to allelic expression 
imbalance (AEI). We demonstrated that AEI of PEX6 is a common phenomenon and is 
correlated with heterozygosity for a frequent variant in the 3' untranslated 
region (UTR) of the mutant allele, which disrupts the most distal of two 
polyadenylation sites. Asymptomatic parents, who were heterozygous for PEX 
c.2578C>T, did not show AEI and were homozygous for the 3' UTR variant. 
Overexpression models confirmed that the overrepresentation of the pathogenic 
PEX6 c.2578T variant compared to wild-type PEX6 c.2578C results in a peroxisome 
biogenesis defect and thus constitutes the cause of disease in the affected 
individuals. AEI promoting the overrepresentation of a mutant allele might also 
play a role in other autosomal-recessive disorders, in which only one 
heterozygous pathogenic variant is identified.
