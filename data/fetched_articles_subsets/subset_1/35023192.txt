WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The BRAF-V600E genetic mutation offers a potential 
targeted therapy for the treatment of papillary craniopharyngiomas.
CASE SUMMARY: A 35-year-old man underwent a craniotomy and subtotal resection of 
a large BRAF-V600E-positive papillary craniopharyngioma before referral to our 
institution. Our treatment included the BRAF-V600 inhibitor dabrafenib mesylate 
(75 mg, twice/day) and trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide (2 mg/day). The residual 
tumour decreased in size by 95% over 21 months without negative side effects.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: We reviewed the literature on BRAF-V600E inhibition 
as a non-invasive method of treating papillary craniopharyngiomas harbouring the 
BRAF-V600E mutation.
