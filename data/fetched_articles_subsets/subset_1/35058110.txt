BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetic field effects on the radiobiological 
effectiveness during treatment of magnetic resonance (MRI) guided particle 
therapy are being debated. This study aims at assessing the influence of a 
perpendicular magnetic field on the biological effects in two human cancer cell 
lines irradiated with proton or carbon ions.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: In vitro cell irradiations were performed in water inside 
a perpendicular magnetic field of 0 and 1T for both protons and carbon ions. 
Samples were located in the center of a spread-out Bragg peak at 8cm water 
equivalent depth with a dose averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) of 4.2 or 
83.4keV/μm for protons and carbon ions, respectively. Physical dose levels of 0, 
0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6Gy were employed. The irradiation field was shifted and 
laterally enlarged, to compensate for the beam deflection due to the magnetic 
field and ensure consistent and homogenous irradiations of the flasks. The human 
cancer cell lines SKMel (Melanoma) and SW1353 (chondrosarcoma) were selected 
which represent a high and a low (α/β)x ratio cell type. Cell survival curves 
were generated applying a linear-quadratic curve fit. DNA damage and DNA damage 
clearance were assessed via γH2AX foci quantification at 1 and 24h post 
radiation treatment.
RESULTS: Without a magnetic field, RBE10 values of 1.04±0.03 (SW1353) and 
1.51±0.06 (SKMel) as well as RBE80 values of 0.93±0.15 (SW1353) and 2.28±0.40 
(SKMel) were calculated for protons. Carbon treatments yielded RBE10 values of 
1.68±0.04 (SW1353) and 2.30±0.07 (SKMel) and RBE80 values of 2.19±0.24 (SW1353) 
and 4.06±0.33 (SKMel). For a field strength of B=1T, RBE10 values of 1.06±0.03 
(SW1353) and 1.47±0.06 (SKMel) resulted from protons, while RBE10 values of 
1.70±0.05 (SW1353) and 2.37±0.08 (SKMel) were obtained for carbon ions. RBE80 
values were calculated to be 1.06±0.12 (SW1353) and 2.33±0.40 (SKMel) following 
protons and 2.13±0.25 (SW1353) and 4.29±0.35 (SKMel) following carbon 
treatments. Substantially increased γH2AX foci per nucleus were found in both 
cell lines 1h after radiation with both ion species. At the 24h time point only 
carbon treated samples of both cell lines showed increased γH2AX levels. The 
presence of the magnetic field did neither influence the survival parameters of 
either cell line, nor initial DNA damage and DNA damage clearance.
CONCLUSIONS: Applying a perpendicular magnetic field did not influence the cell 
survival, DNA repair, nor the biological effectiveness of protons or carbon ions 
in two human cancer cell lines.
