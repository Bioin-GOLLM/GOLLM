PURPOSE: To observe the expression of Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), myeloid 
differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65) in 
iris tissue during endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) and evaluate the significance 
of these factors in uveitis.
METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (0  h, 12  h, 24  h, 
48  h, and 72  h, n = 10/group). Animal model of acute anterior uveitis was 
established by a hind footpad injection of 200  μg Cholera vibrio LPS. 
Expression of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 in iris ciliary body tissue was 
detected through immunohistochemical staining.
RESULTS: Expression of TLR4 was not detected in normal iris-ciliary body 
complex, TLR4 positive cells with round morphology appeared in the iris stroma 
12 hours after injection, significantly increased (P < .001) 48 hours after 
injection, and decreased gradually 72 hours after injection. Expression of MyD88 
and NF-κB p65 is consistent with the change of the TLR4.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased expression of TLR4 and its downstream signal 
transduction moleculesMyD88, NF-κB p65 indicate the potential role of pathway in 
the pathogenesis of acute anterior uveitis (AAU).
