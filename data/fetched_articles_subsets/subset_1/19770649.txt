PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the recent advances in our understanding of the 
majors genes involved in chondrogenesis and their molecular mechanisms.
RECENT FINDINGS: Disorders of the growth plate and the resulting skeletal 
dysplasias are a consequence of defects in genes involved in various stages of 
the chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation process. Recent identification 
of disease genes has provided insights into the pathophysiology of many skeletal 
dysplasias.
SUMMARY: This knowledge enhances our understanding of the physiology and 
pathophysiology of the growth plate. Many skeletal dysplasias can now be 
characterized at the molecular level, allowing clinicians to provide accurate 
molecular diagnoses and counseling. Further research in this area will likely 
provide insights into possible therapeutic options for disorders of the growth 
plate.
