A new strategy to create site-specific, homogeneous, and bright silver 
nanoclusters (AgNCs) with high-stability was demonstrated by triplex DNA as 
template. By reasonable design of DNA sequence, homogeneous Ag(2) cluster was 
obtained in the predefined position of CG.C(+) site of triplex DNA. This 
strategy was also explored for controlled alignment of AgNCs on the DNA 
nanoscaffold. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first example to 
simultaneously answer the challenges of excellent site-specific nucleation and 
growth, homogeneity and stability against salt of DNA-templated AgNCs.
