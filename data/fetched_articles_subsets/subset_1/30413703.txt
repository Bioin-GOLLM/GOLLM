Guanine-rich RNA sequences can fold into four-stranded structures, termed 
G-quadruplexes (G4-RNAs), whose biological roles are poorly understood, and in 
vivo existence is debated. To profile biologically relevant G4-RNA in the human 
transcriptome, we report here on G4RP-seq, which combines G4-RNA-specific 
precipitation (G4RP) with sequencing. This protocol comprises a chemical 
crosslinking step, followed by affinity capture with the G4-specific 
small-molecule ligand/probe BioTASQ, and target identification by sequencing, 
allowing for capturing global snapshots of transiently folded G4-RNAs. We detect 
widespread G4-RNA targets within the transcriptome, indicative of transient G4 
formation in living human cells. Using G4RP-seq, we also demonstrate that 
G4-stabilizing ligands (BRACO-19 and RHPS4) can change the G4 transcriptomic 
landscape, most notably in long non-coding RNAs. G4RP-seq thus provides a method 
for studying the G4-RNA landscape, as well as ways of considering the mechanisms 
underlying G4-RNA formation, and the activity of G4-stabilizing ligands.
