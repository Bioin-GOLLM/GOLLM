Cyclospora cayetanensis is an emerging foodborne parasite that causes 
cyclosporiasis, an enteric disease of humans. Domestically acquired outbreaks 
have been reported in Canada every spring or summer since 2013. To date, 
investigations into the potential sources of infection have relied solely on 
epidemiological data. To supplement the epidemiological data with genetic 
information, we genotyped 169 Canadian cyclosporiasis cases from stool specimens 
collected from 2010 to 2021 using an existing eight-marker targeted amplicon 
deep (TADS) scheme specific to C. cayetanensis as previously described by the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This is the first study to 
genotype Canadian Cyclospora cayetanensis isolates, and it focuses on evaluating 
the genotyping performance and genetic clustering. Genotyping information was 
successfully collected with at least part of one of the markers in the TADS 
assay for 97.9% of specimens, and 81.1% of cyclosporiasis cases met the minimum 
requirements to genetically cluster into 20 groups. The performance of the 
scheme suggests that examining cyclosporiasis cases genetically will be a 
valuable tool for supplementing epidemiological outbreak investigations and to 
minimize further infections. Further research is required to expand the number 
of discriminatory markers to improve genetic clustering.
