Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are most commonly designed to reduce targeted 
RNA via RNase H1-dependent degradation. In this paper we demonstrate that 
cellular proteins can compete for sites targeted by RNase H1-dependent ASOs. We 
further show that some ASOs designed to mediate RNase H1 cleavage can, in 
certain instances, promote target reduction both by RNase H1-mediated cleavage 
and by steric inhibition of binding of splicing factors at a site required for 
efficient processing of the pre-mRNA. In the latter case, RNase H cleavage was 
prevented by binding of a second protein, HSPA8, to the ASO/pre-mRNA 
heteroduplex. In addition, using a precisely controlled minigene system, we 
directly demonstrated that activity of ASOs targeting sites in introns is 
strongly influenced by splicing efficiency.
