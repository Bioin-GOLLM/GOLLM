Neuromuscular ventilatory weakness can be difficult to recognize because the 
symptoms can be nocturnal, nonspecific, or attributed to other conditions. The 
presence of respiratory muscle weakness suggests a number of possible 
heterogeneous conditions, including neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and genetic 
neuromuscular diseases. In some conditions, disease-modifying management exists, 
but in the absence of such intervention, supportive respiratory therapy can 
improve quality of life and survival. In this review, we discuss the 
differential diagnosis and diagnostic approach to chronic neuromuscular 
respiratory weakness. We also review the clinical assessment and management of 
respiratory failure in these conditions.
