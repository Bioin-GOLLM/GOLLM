OBJECTIVE: Recently identified mutations of the axon guidance molecule receptor 
gene, DCC, present an opportunity to investigate, in living human brain, 
mechanisms affecting neural connectivity and the basis of mirror movements, 
involuntary contralateral responses that mirror voluntary unilateral actions. We 
hypothesized that haploinsufficient DCC+/- mutation carriers with mirror 
movements would exhibit decreased DCC mRNA expression, a functional ipsilateral 
corticospinal tract, greater "mirroring" motor representations, and reduced 
interhemispheric inhibition. DCC+/- mutation carriers without mirror movements 
might exhibit some of these features.
METHODS: The participants (n = 52) included 13 DCC+/- mutation carriers with 
mirror movements, 7 DCC+/- mutation carriers without mirror movements, 13 
relatives without the mutation or mirror movements, and 19 unrelated healthy 
volunteers. The multimodal approach comprised quantitative real time polymerase 
chain reaction, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) under resting and task conditions, and measures of 
white matter integrity.
RESULTS: Mirror movements were associated with reduced DCC mRNA expression, 
increased ipsilateral TMS-induced motor evoked potentials, increased fMRI 
responses in the mirroring M1 and cerebellum, and markedly reduced 
interhemispheric inhibition. The DCC+/- mutation, irrespective of mirror 
movements, was associated with reduced functional connectivity and white matter 
integrity.
INTERPRETATION: Diverse connectivity abnormalities were identified in mutation 
carriers with and without mirror movements, but corticospinal effects and 
decreased peripheral DCC mRNA appeared driven by the mirror movement phenotype.
