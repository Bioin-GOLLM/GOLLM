BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a 
significant health issue closely associated with multiple metabolic 
dysfunctions. The association between MAFLD and cancer risk is yet unknown.
METHODS: UK Biobank study participants were diagnosed for the presence of MAFLD 
at baseline. A multivariable Cox regression model was performed to examine the 
associations of MAFLD with incident events in 24 specific cancers.
RESULTS: We included 352,911 individuals (37.2% with MAFLD), among whom 23,345 
developed cancers. Compared with non-MAFLD, MAFLD was significantly associated 
with 10 of the 24 examined cancers, including corpus uteri (hazard ratio 
[HR] = 2.36, 95% CI 1.99-2.80), gallbladder (2.20, 1.14-4.23), liver (1.81, 
1.43-2.28), kidney (1.77, 1.49-2.11), thyroid (1.69, 1.20-2.38), esophagus 
(1.48, 1.25-1.76), pancreas (1.31, 1.10-1.56), bladder (1.26, 1.11-1.43), breast 
(1.19, 1.11-1.27), and colorectal and anus cancers (1.14, 1.06-1.23). The 
associations of MAFLD with liver, esophageal, pancreatic, colorectal and anal 
and bladder cancers and malignant melanoma were strengthened in males, and 
associations with kidney, thyroid, and lung cancers were increased in females. 
The associations of MAFLD with the risk of liver, kidney, and thyroid cancers 
remained significant after further adjusting for the waist circumference or body 
mass index and the number of metabolic syndrome components based on the main 
models. The risk-increasing allele of PNPLA3 rs738409 significantly amplified 
the association of MAFLD with the risk of liver and kidney cancers.
CONCLUSION: MAFLD is associated with an increased risk of a set of cancers, but 
the effect substantially varies by site. MAFLD deserves higher priority in the 
current scheme of cancer prevention.
