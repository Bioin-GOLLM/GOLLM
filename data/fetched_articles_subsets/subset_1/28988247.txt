AIMS: The aim of our study was to explore differences in genetic predisposition 
to obesity between the Hungarian general and Roma populations.
METHODS: A total of 1,152 samples from the Hungarian Roma population and 1,743 
samples from the Hungarian general population were genotyped for 20 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of obesity. Two types 
of multilocus genetic risk scores were constructed to estimate the combined 
effect of selected SNPs.
RESULTS: Risk allele frequencies differed significantly between the two 
populations for 11 SNPs, with no enrichment in any of the two study groups. 
Variants (rs1558902, rs1121980, rs9939609, and rs9941349) in the fat mass and 
obesity-associated (FTO) gene exhibited strong but ethnicity-independent 
association with obesity. Genetic risk scores showed stronger associations with 
obesity in the Roma population compared with the Hungarian general population; 
however, without significant gene-population interaction.
CONCLUSION: Differences in obesity prevalence between the Hungarian general and 
Hungarian Roma populations could not be explained by their distinct genetic 
susceptibility, rather by ethnicity-related environmental and behavioral 
factors. Nonetheless, particular gene-environment interactions might contribute 
to the distinct penetrance of the obesity-associated genetic factors in 
populations of different ethnic backgrounds.
