Overgeneralization of conditioned threat responses is a robust clinical marker 
of anxiety disorders. In overgeneralization, responses that are appropriate to 
threat-predicting cues are evoked by perceptually similar safety-predicting 
cues. Inappropriate learning of conditioned threat responses may thus form an 
etiological basis for anxiety disorders. The role of dopamine (DA) in memory 
encoding is well established. Indeed by signaling salience and valence, DA is 
thought to facilitate discriminative learning between stimuli representing 
safety or threat. However, the neuroanatomical and biochemical substrates 
through which DA modulates overgeneralization of threat responses remain poorly 
understood. Here we report that the modulation of DA D2 receptor (D2R) signaling 
bidirectionally regulates the consolidation of fear responses. While the 
blockade of D2R induces generalized threat responses, its stimulation 
facilitates discriminative learning between stimuli representing safety or 
threat. Moreover, we show that controlled threat generalization requires the 
coordinated activation of D2R in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the 
central amygdala. Finally, we identify the mTORC1 cascade activation as an 
important molecular event by which D2R mediates its effects. These data reveal 
that D2R signaling in the extended amygdala constitutes an important checkpoint 
through which DA participates in the control of threat processing and the 
emergence of overgeneralized threat responses.
