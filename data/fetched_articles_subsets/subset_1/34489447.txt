Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common hallmark of neurological disorders, and 
reducing mitochondrial damage is considered a promising neuroprotective 
therapeutic strategy. Here, we used high-throughput small molecule screening to 
identify CHIR99021 as a potent enhancer of mitochondrial function. CHIR99021 
improved mitochondrial phenotypes and enhanced cell viability in several models 
of Huntington's disease (HD), a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disorder. 
Notably, CHIR99201 treatment reduced HD-associated neuropathology and behavioral 
defects in HD mice and improved mitochondrial function and cell survival in HD 
patient-derived neurons. Independent of its known inhibitory activity against 
glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), CHIR99021 treatment in HD models suppressed 
the proteasomal degradation of calpastatin (CAST), and subsequently inhibited 
calpain activation, a well-established effector of neural death, and Drp1, a 
driver of mitochondrial fragmentation. Our results established CAST-Drp1 as a 
druggable signaling axis in HD pathogenesis and highlighted CHIR99021 as a 
mitochondrial function enhancer and a potential lead for developing HD 
therapies.
