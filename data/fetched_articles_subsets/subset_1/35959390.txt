Prospective cohort studies following individuals from acute infections have 
documented a prevalent post-infective fatigue state meeting diagnostic criteria 
for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) - that is, a post-infective fatigue syndrome 
(PIFS). The Dubbo Infection Outcomes Study (DIOS) was a prospective cohort 
following individuals from acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Ross 
River virus (RRV), or Q fever through to assessment of caseness for CFS 
designated by physician and psychiatrist assessments at 6 months. Previous 
studies in DIOS have revealed that functional genetic polymorphisms in both 
immunological (pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines) and neurological (the 
purinergic receptor, P2X7) genes are associated with both the severity of the 
acute infection and subsequent prolonged illness. Principal components analysis 
was applied to self-report data from DIOS to describe the severity and course of 
both the overall illness and concurrent mood disturbance. Associations between 
demographics and acute infection characteristics, with prolonged illness course 
as well as the PIFS outcome were examined using multivariable statistics. 
Genetic haplotype-driven functional variations in the neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene 
previously shown to be associated with brain responses to stress, and to trait 
anxiety were also examined as predictors. The sample included 484 subjects (51% 
female, median age 32, IQR 19-44), of whom 90 (19%) met diagnostic criteria for 
CFS at 6 months. Participants with greater overall illness severity and 
concurrent mood disturbance in the acute illness had a more prolonged illness 
severity (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.34-0.46, p < 0.001) and mood disturbance (HR = 
0.36, 95% CI: 0.30-0.42, p < 0.001), respectively. Baseline illness severity and 
RRV infection were associated with delayed recovery. Female gender and mood 
disturbance in the acute illness were associated with prolonged mood 
disturbance. Logistic regression showed that the odds of an individual being 
diagnosed with PIFS increased with greater baseline illness severity (OR = 2.24, 
95% CI: 1.71-2.94, p < 0.001). There was no association between the NPY 
haplotypes with overall illness severity or mood disturbance either during the 
acute illness phase or with prolonged illness (p > 0.05). Severe acute infective 
illnesses predicted prolonged illness, prolonged mood disturbance and PIFS. 
These factors may facilitate early intervention to manage both PIFS and mood 
disturbances.
