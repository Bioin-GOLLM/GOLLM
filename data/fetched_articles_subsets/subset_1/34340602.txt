Sorafenib is recommended as the primary therapeutic drug for patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma. To discover a new compound that avoids low response 
rates and toxic side effects that occur in sorafenib therapy, we designed and 
synthesized new hybrid compounds of sorafenib and 2,4,5-trimethylpyridin-3-ols. 
Compound 6 was selected as the best of 24 hybrids that inhibit each of the four 
Raf kinases. The anti-proliferative activity of 6 in HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7 cell 
lines was slightly lower than that of sorafenib. However, in H6c7 and CCD841 
normal epithelial cell lines, the cytotoxicity of 6 was much lower than that of 
sorafenib. In addition, similar to sorafenib, compound 6 inhibited spheroid 
forming ability of Hep3B cells in vitro and tumour growth in a xenograft tumour 
model of the chick chorioallantoic membrane implanted with Huh7 cells. Compound 
6 may be a promising candidate targeting hepatocellular carcinoma with low toxic 
side effects on normal cells.
