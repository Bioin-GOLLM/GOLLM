Numerous neuroimaging studies have revealed structural brain abnormalities in 
schizophrenia patients. There is emerging evidence that dysfunctional nerve 
growth factor (NGF) signaling may contribute to structural brain alterations 
found in these patients. In this pilot study, we investigated whether there was 
a correlation between NGF serum levels and gray matter volume (GMV) in 
schizophrenia patients. Further, we investigated whether there was an overlap 
between the correlative findings and cross-sectional GMV differences between 
schizophrenia patients (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 19). Serum NGF was 
significantly correlated to GMV in the left prefrontal lobe, the left 
midcingulate cortex, and the brainstem in schizophrenia patients. However, we 
did not find any correlations of NGF serum levels with GMV in healthy controls. 
Schizophrenia patients showed smaller GMV than healthy controls in brain regions 
located in the bilateral limbic system, bilateral parietal lobe, bilateral 
insula, bilateral primary auditory cortex, left frontal lobe, and bilateral 
occipital regions. In a conjunction analysis, GMV in the left midcingulate 
cortex (MCC) appears negatively correlated to NGF serum levels in the group of 
schizophrenia patients and also to be reduced compared to healthy controls. 
These results suggest an increased vulnerability of schizophrenia patients to 
changes in NGF levels compared to healthy controls and support a role for NGF 
signaling in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. As our pilot study is 
exploratory in nature, further studies enrolling larger sample sizes will be 
needed to further corroborate our findings and to investigate the influence of 
additional covariates.
