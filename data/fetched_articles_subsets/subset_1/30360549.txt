As a platform for hepsin-specific drug delivery, we previously prepared 
IPLVVPLRRRRRRRRC peptide (RIPL)-conjugated nanostructured lipid carriers 
(RIPL-NLCs) composed of Labrafil® M 1944 CS (liquid oil) and Precirol® ATO 5 
(solid lipid). In this study, to prevent the recognition by the mononuclear 
phagocyte system, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified RIPL-NLCs (PEG-RIPL-NLCs) 
were prepared using PEG3000 at different grafting ratios (1, 5, and 10 mole %). 
All prepared NLCs showed a homogeneous dispersion (130⁻280 nm), with zeta 
potentials varying from -18 to 10 mV. Docetaxel (DTX) was successfully 
encapsulated in NLCs: encapsulation efficiency (93⁻95%); drug-loading capacity 
(102⁻109 µg/mg). PEG-RIPL-NLCs with a grafting ratio of 5% PEG or higher showed 
significantly reduced protein adsorption and macrophage phagocytosis. The uptake 
of PEG(5%)-RIPL-NLCs by cancer cell lines was somewhat lower than that of 
RIPL-NLCs because of the PEG-induced steric hindrance; however, the uptake level 
of PEG-RIPL-NLCs was still greater than that of plain NLCs. In vivo 
biodistribution was evaluated after tail vein injection of NLCs to normal mice. 
Compared to RIPL-NLCs, PEG(5%)-RIPL-NLCs showed lower accumulation in the liver, 
spleen, and lung. In conclusion, we found that PEG(5%)-RIPL-NLCs could be a 
promising nanocarrier for selective drug targeting with a high payload of poorly 
water-soluble drugs.
