The glucose transporter from Staphylococcus epidermidis, GlcPSe, is a homolog of 
the human GLUT sugar transporters of the major facilitator superfamily. Together 
with the xylose transporter from Escherichia coli, XylEEc, the other prominent 
prokaryotic GLUT homolog, GlcPSe, is equipped with a conserved proton-binding 
site arguing for an electrogenic transport mode. However, the 
electrophysiological analysis of GlcPSe presented here reveals important 
differences between the two GLUT homologs. GlcPSe, unlike XylEEc, does not 
perform steady-state electrogenic transport at symmetrical pH conditions. 
Furthermore, when a pH gradient is applied, partially uncoupled transport modes 
can be generated. In contrast to other bacterial sugar transporters analyzed so 
far, in GlcPSe sugar binding, translocation and release are also accomplished by 
the deprotonated transporter. Based on these experimental results, we conclude 
that coupling of sugar and H+ transport is incomplete in GlcPSe. To verify the 
viability of the observed partially coupled GlcPSe transport modes, we propose a 
universal eight-state kinetic model in which any degree of coupling is realized 
and H+/sugar symport represents only a specific instance. Furthermore, using 
sequence comparison with strictly coupled XylEEc and similar sugar transporters, 
we identify an additional charged residue that may be essential for effective 
H+/sugar symport.
