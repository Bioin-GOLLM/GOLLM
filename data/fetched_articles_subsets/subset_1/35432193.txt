BACKGROUND: The clinical profile and genetics of individuals with 
Disorders/Differences of Sex Development (DSD) has not been reported in Ukraine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established the Ukrainian DSD Register and identified 
682 DSD patients. This cohort includes, 357 patients (52.3% [303 patients with 
Turner syndrome)] with sex chromosome DSD, 119 (17.5%) with 46,XY DSD and 206 
(30.2%) with 46,XX DSD. Patients with sex chromosome DSD and congenital adrenal 
hyperplasia (CAH, n=185) were excluded from further studies. Fluorescence in 
situ hybridization (FISH) was performed for eight 46,XX boys. 79 patients 
underwent Whole Exome Sequencing (WES).
RESULTS: The majority of patients with 46,XY and 46,XX DSD (n=140), were raised 
as female (56.3% and 61.9% respectively). WES (n=79) identified pathogenic (P) 
or likely pathogenic (LP) variants in 43% of the cohort. P/LP variants were 
identified in the androgen receptor (AR) and NR5A1 genes (20.2%). Variants in 
other DSD genes including AMHR2, HSD17B3, MYRF, ANOS1, FGFR11, WT1, DHX37, 
SRD5A1, GATA4, TBCE, CACNA1A and GLI2 were identified in 22.8% of cases. 83.3% 
of all P/LP variants are novel. 35.3% of patients with a genetic diagnosis had 
an atypical clinical presentation. A known pathogenic variant in WDR11, which 
was reported to cause congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH), was 
identified in individuals with primary hypogonadism.
CONCLUSIONS: WES is a powerful tool to identify novel causal variants in 
patients with DSD, including a significant minority that have an atypical 
clinical presentation. Our data suggest that heterozygous variants in the WDR11 
gene are unlikely to cause of CHH.
