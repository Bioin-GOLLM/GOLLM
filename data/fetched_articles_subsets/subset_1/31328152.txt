The vascular endothelial cells (ECs) that line the inner layer of blood vessels 
are responsible for maintaining vascular homeostasis under physiological 
conditions. In the presence of disease or injury, ECs can become dysfunctional 
and contribute to a progressive decline in vascular health. ECs are constantly 
exposed to a variety of dynamic mechanical stimuli, including hemodynamic shear 
stress, pulsatile stretch, and passive signaling cues derived from the 
extracellular matrix. This review describes the molecular mechanisms by which 
ECs perceive and interpret these mechanical signals. The translational 
applications of mechanosensing are then discussed in the context of 
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and engineering of vascular grafts.
