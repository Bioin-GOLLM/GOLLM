Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy that is the most common 
type of acute leukemia diagnosed in adults and the second most common type in 
children. The overall survival is poor and treatment is associated with 
significant complications and even death. In addition, a significant number of 
patients will not respond to therapy or relapse. In this review, several new 
signaling proteins aberrantly regulated in AML are described, including CREB, 
Triad1, Bcl-2 family members, Stat3, and mTOR/MEK. Identifying more effective 
and less toxic agents will provide novel approaches to treat AML.
