Ceftriaxone is a beta-lactam antibiotic that increases the expression of the 
major glutamate transporter, GLT-1. As such, ceftriaxone ameliorates symptoms 
across multiple rodent models of neurological diseases and substance use 
disorders. However, the mechanism behind GLT-1 upregulation is unknown. The 
present review synthesizes this literature in order to identify commonalities in 
molecular changes. We find that ceftriaxone (200 mg/kg for at least two days) 
consistently restores GLT-1 expression in multiple rodent models of neurological 
disease, especially when GLT-1 is decreased in the disease model. The same dose 
given to healthy/drug-naive rodents does not reliably upregulate GLT-1 in any 
brain region except the hippocampus. Increased GLT-1 expression does not 
consistently arise from transcriptional regulation, and is likely to be due to 
trafficking changes. In addition to altered transporter expression, ceftriaxone 
ameliorates neuropathologies (e.g. tau, amyloid beta, cell death) and aberrant 
protein expression associated with a number of neurological disease models. 
Taken together, these results indicate that ceftriaxone remains a strong 
candidate for treatment of multiple disorders in the clinic.
