Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of 
skin and internal organs. Protein tyrosine phosphatases have received little 
attention in the study of SSc or fibrosis. Here, we show that the tyrosine 
phosphatase PTP4A1 is highly expressed in fibroblasts from patients with SSc. 
PTP4A1 and its close homolog PTP4A2 are critical promoters of TGFβ signaling in 
primary dermal fibroblasts and of bleomycin-induced fibrosis in vivo. PTP4A1 
promotes TGFβ signaling in human fibroblasts through enhancement of ERK 
activity, which stimulates SMAD3 expression and nuclear translocation. Upstream 
from ERK, we show that PTP4A1 directly interacts with SRC and inhibits SRC basal 
activation independently of its phosphatase activity. Unexpectedly, PTP4A2 
minimally interacts with SRC and does not promote the SRC-ERK-SMAD3 pathway. 
Thus, in addition to defining PTP4A1 as a molecule of interest for 
TGFβ-dependent fibrosis, our study provides information regarding the functional 
specificity of different members of the PTP4A subclass of phosphatases.
