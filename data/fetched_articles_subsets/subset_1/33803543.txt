Worldwide, most Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections are acquired 
through heterosexual intercourse, and in sub-Saharan Africa, 59% of new HIV 
infections affect women. Vaccines and microbicides hold promise for preventing 
the acquisition of HIV. To this end, the study of HIV highly exposed 
seronegative (HESN) female commercial sex workers (CSWs), who constitute a model 
of natural immunity to HIV, provides an exceptional opportunity to determine 
important clues for the development of preventive strategies. Studies using both 
female genital tract (FGT) and peripheral blood samples of HESN CSWs, have 
allowed identifying distinct features, notably low-inflammatory patterns 
associated with resistance to infection. How this seemingly regulated response 
is achieved at the initial site of HIV infection remains unknown. One hypothesis 
is that populations presenting regulatory profiles contribute to the 
orchestration of potent anti-viral and low-inflammatory responses at the initial 
site of HIV transmission. Here, we view to update our knowledge regarding this 
issue.
