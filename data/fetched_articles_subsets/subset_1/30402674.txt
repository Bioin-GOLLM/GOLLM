PURPOSE: Current reference methods for measuring glucose effectiveness (GE) are 
the somatostatin pancreatic glucose clamp and minimal model analysis of 
frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT), both of which 
are laborious and not feasible in large epidemiological studies. Consequently, 
surrogate indices derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to measure 
GE (oGE) have been proposed and used in many studies. However, the predictive 
accuracy of these surrogates has not been formally validated. In this study, we 
used a calibration model analysis to evaluate the accuracy of surrogate indices 
to predict GE from the reference FSIVGTT (SgMM).
METHODS: Subjects (n = 123, mean age 48 ± 11 years; BMI 35.9 ± 7.3 kg/m2) with 
varying glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 37; IFG/IGT, n = 78; and T2DM, n = 8) 
underwent FSIVGTT and OGTT on two separate days. Predictive accuracy was 
assessed by both root mean squared error (RMSE) of prediction and leave-one-out 
cross-validation-type RMSE of prediction (CVPE).
RESULTS: As expected, insulin sensitivity, SgMM, and oGE were reduced in 
subjects with T2DM and IFG/IGT when compared with NGT. Simple linear regression 
analyses revealed a modest but significant relationship between oGE and SgMM 
(r = 0.25, p < 0.001). However, using calibration model, measured SgMM and 
predicted SgMM derived from oGE were modestly correlated (r = 0.21, p < 0.05) 
with the best fit line suggesting poor predictive accuracy. There were no 
significant differences in CVPE and RMSE among the surrogates, suggesting 
similar predictive ability.
CONCLUSIONS: Although OGTT-derived surrogate indices of GE are convenient and 
feasible, they have limited ability to robustly predict GE.
