We compared therapeutic properties of natural and engineered chemokine (C-X-C 
motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) agonists in a rat acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) model utilizing the PaO2/FiO2-ratio as a clinically relevant primary 
outcome criterion. Ventilated rats underwent unilateral lung ischemia from 
t = 0-70 min plus hemorrhage to a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of 30 mmHg 
from t = 40-70 min, followed by reperfusion/fluid resuscitation until 
t = 300 min. Natural CXCR4 agonists (CXCL12, ubiquitin) and engineered CXCL12 
variants (CXCL121, CXCL22, CXCL12K27A/R41A/R47A, CXCL12 (3-68)) were 
administered within 5 min of fluid resuscitation. Animals treated with vehicle 
or CXCL12 (3-68) reached criteria for mild and moderate ARDS between 
t = 90-120 min and t = 120-180 min, respectively, and remained in moderate ARDS 
until t = 300 min. Ubiquitin, CXCL12, CXCL121 and CXCL122 prevented ARDS 
development. Potencies of CXCL12/CXCL121/CXCL122 were higher than the potency of 
ubiquitin. CXCL12K27A/R41A/R47A was inefficacious. CXCL121 > CXCL12 stabilized 
MAP and reduced fluid requirements. CXCR4 agonists at doses that preserved lung 
function reduced histological injury of the post-ischemic lung and reduced 
mortality from 55 to 9%. Our findings suggest that CXCR4 protein agonists 
prevent development of ARDS and reduce mortality in a rat model, and that 
development of new engineered protein therapeutics with improved pharmacological 
properties for ARDS is possible.
