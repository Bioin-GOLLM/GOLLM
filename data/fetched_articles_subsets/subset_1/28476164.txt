Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a highly conserved pathway through evolution, regulates 
key cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, migration, 
genetic stability, apoptosis, and stem cell renewal. The Wnt pathway mediates 
biological processes by a canonical or noncanonical pathway, depending on the 
involvement of β-catenin in signal transduction. β-catenin is a core component 
of the cadherin protein complex, whose stabilization is essential for the 
activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. As multiple aberrations in this pathway 
occur in numerous cancers, WNT-directed therapy represents an area of 
significant developmental therapeutics focus. The recently described role of 
Wnt/β-catenin pathway in regulating immune cell infiltration of the tumor 
microenvironment renewed the interest, given its potential impact on responses 
to immunotherapy treatments. This article summarizes the role of Wnt/β-catenin 
pathway in cancer and ongoing therapeutic strategies involving this pathway.
