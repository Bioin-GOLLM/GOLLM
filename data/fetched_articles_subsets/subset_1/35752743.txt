Standard molecular classification of endometrial cancers (EC) is now endorsed by 
the WHO and identifies p53-abnormal (p53abn) EC as the subgroup with the poorest 
prognosis and the most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemo(radio)therapy. 
P53abn EC are POLE wildtype, mismatch repair proficient and show abnormal 
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for p53. Correct interpretation of routinely 
performed p53 IHC has therefore become of paramount importance. We aimed to 
comprehensively investigate abnormal p53 IHC patterns and their relation to 
clinicopathological and molecular features. Tumor material of 411 molecularly 
classified high-risk EC from consenting patients from the PORTEC-3 clinical 
trial were collected. p53 IHC was successful in 408 EC and was considered 
abnormal when the tumor showed a mutant expression pattern (including 
subclonal): overexpression, null or cytoplasmic. The presence of pathogenic 
mutations was determined by next generation sequencing (NGS). Abnormal p53 
expression was observed in 131/408 (32%) tumors. The most common abnormal p53 
IHC pattern was overexpression (n = 89, 68%), followed by null (n = 12, 9%) and 
cytoplasmic (n = 3, 2%). Subclonal abnormal p53 staining was observed in 27 
cases (21%), which was frequently but not exclusively, associated with POLE 
mutations and/or MMRd (n = 22/27; p < 0.001). Agreement between p53 IHC and TP53 
NGS was observed in 90.7%, resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 83.6% 
and 94.3%, respectively. Excluding POLEmut and MMRd EC, as per the WHO-endorsed 
algorithm, increased the accuracy to 94.5% with sensitivity and specificity of 
95.0% and 94.1%, respectively. Our data shows that awareness of the abnormal p53 
IHC patterns are prerequisites for correct EC molecular classification. 
Subclonal abnormal p53 expression is a strong indicator for POLEmut and/or MMRd 
EC. No significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed among the 
abnormal p53 IHC patterns. Our data support use of the WHO-endorsed algorithm 
and combining the different abnormal p53 IHC patterns into one diagnostic entity 
(p53abn EC).
