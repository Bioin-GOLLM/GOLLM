Current research has demonstrated that small cationic amphipathic peptides have 
strong potential not only as antimicrobials, but also as antibiofilm agents, 
immune modulators, and anti-inflammatories. Although traditionally termed 
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) these additional roles have prompted a shift in 
terminology to use the broader term host defense peptides (HDPs) to capture the 
multi-functional nature of these molecules. In this review, we critically 
examined the role of AMPs and HDPs in infectious diseases and inflammation. It 
is generally accepted that HDPs are multi-faceted mediators of a wide range of 
biological processes, with individual activities dependent on their polypeptide 
sequence. In this context, we explore the concept of chemical space as it 
applies to HDPs and hypothesize that the various functions and activities of 
this class of molecule exist on independent but overlapping activity landscapes. 
Finally, we outline several emerging functions and roles of HDPs and highlight 
how an improved understanding of these processes can potentially be leveraged to 
more fully realize the therapeutic promise of HDPs.
