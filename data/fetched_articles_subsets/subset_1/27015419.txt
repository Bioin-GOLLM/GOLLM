In adult mammals, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are defined by their abilities 
to self-renew and to differentiate to form all blood cell lineages. These rare 
multipotent cells occupy specific locations in the bone marrow (BM) 
microenvironment. The specific microenvironment regulating HSCs, commonly 
referred to as the niche, comprises multiple cell types whose exact 
contributions are under active investigation. Understanding cellular cross talk 
involving HSCs in the BM microenvironment is of fundamental importance for 
harnessing therapies against benign and malignant blood diseases. In this 
review, we summarize and evaluate recent advances in our understanding of niche 
heterogeneity and its influence on HSC function.
