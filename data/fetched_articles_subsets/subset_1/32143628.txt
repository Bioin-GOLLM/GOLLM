BACKGROUND: Application of whole genome sequencing (WGS) enables identification 
of non-coding variants that play a phenotype-modifying role and are undetectable 
by exome sequencing. Recently, non-coding regulatory single nucleotide variants 
(SNVs) have been reported in patients with lethal lung developmental disorders 
(LLDDs) or congenital scoliosis with recurrent copy-number variant (CNV) 
deletions at 17q23.1q23.2 or 16p11.2, respectively.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a deceased newborn with pulmonary 
hypertension and pulmonary interstitial emphysema with features suggestive of 
pulmonary hypoplasia, resulting in respiratory failure and neonatal death soon 
after birth. Using the array comparative genomic hybridization and WGS, two 
heterozygous recurrent CNV deletions: ~ 2.2 Mb on 17q23.1q23.2, involving TBX4, 
and ~ 600 kb on 16p11.2, involving TBX6, that both arose de novo on maternal 
chromosomes were identified. In the predicted lung-specific enhancer upstream to 
TBX4, we have detected seven novel putative regulatory non-coding SNVs that were 
absent in 13 control individuals with the overlapping deletions but without any 
structural lung anomalies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further support a recently reported model of complex 
compound inheritance of LLDD in which both non-coding and coding heterozygous 
TBX4 variants contribute to the lung phenotype. In addition, this is the first 
report of a patient with combined de novo heterozygous recurrent 17q23.1q23.2 
and 16p11.2 CNV deletions.
