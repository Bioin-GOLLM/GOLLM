BACKGROUND: Diagnostic screening for pathogenic variants in breast cancer 
susceptibility genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, PTEN and TP53, may be 
offered to New Zealanders from suspected high-risk breast (and ovarian) cancer 
families. However, it is unknown how many high-risk pathogenic variant carriers 
in New Zealand are not offered genetic screening using existing triage tools and 
guidelines for breast (and ovarian) cancer patients.
METHODS: Panel-gene sequencing of the coding and non-coding regions of the BRCA1 
and BRCA2 genes, and the coding regions and splice sites of CDH1, PALB2, PTEN 
and TP53, was undertaken for an unselected cohort of 367 female breast cancer 
patients. A total of 1685 variants were evaluated using the ENIGMA and the 
ACMG/AMP variant classification guidelines.
RESULTS: Our study identified that 13 (3.5%) breast cancer patients carried a 
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, or PTEN. A 
significantly higher number of pathogenic variant carriers had grade 3 tumours 
(10/13) when compared to non-carriers; however, no other clinicopathological 
characteristics were found to be significantly different between (likely) 
pathogenic variant carriers and non-carriers, nor between variant of unknown 
significance carriers and non-carriers. Notably, 46% of the identified (likely) 
pathogenic variant carriers had not been referred for a genetic assessment and 
consideration of genetic testing.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows a potential under-ascertainment of women carrying a 
(likely) pathogenic variant in a high-risk breast cancer susceptibility gene. 
These results suggest that further research into testing pathways for New 
Zealand breast cancer patients may be required to reduce the impact of 
hereditary cancer syndromes for these individuals and their families.
