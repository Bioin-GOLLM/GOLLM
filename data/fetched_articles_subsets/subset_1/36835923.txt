The study was conducted from October 2020 to March 2022 in a province in 
southern Thailand. The inpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 
more than 18 years old were enrolled. Of the 1511 inpatients with CAP, COVID-19 
was the leading cause, accounting for 27%. Among the patients with COVID-19 CAP, 
mortalities, mechanical ventilators, ICU admissions, ICU stay, and hospital 
costs were significantly higher than of those with non-COVID-19 CAP. Household 
and workplace contact with COVID-19, co-morbidities, lymphocytopenia and 
peripheral infiltration in chest imaging were associated with CAP due to 
COVID-19. The delta variant yielded the most unfavorable clinical and 
non-clinical outcomes. While COVID-19 CAP due to B.1.113, Alpha and Omicron 
variants had relatively similar outcomes. Among those with CAP, COVID-19 
infection as well as obesity, a higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and 
APACHE II score were associated with in-hospital mortality. Among those with 
COVID-19 CAP, obesity, infection due to the Delta variant, a higher CCI and 
higher APACHE II score were associated with in-hospital mortality. COVID-19 had 
a great impact on the epidemiology and outcomes of CAP.
