BACKGROUND: Diffuse midline gliomas (DMG), including diffuse intrinsic pontine 
gliomas (DIPGs), are a fatal form of brain cancer. These tumors often carry a 
driver mutation on histone H3 converting lysine 27 to methionine (H3K27M). 
DMG-H3K27M are characterized by altered metabolism and resistance to standard of 
care radiation (RT), but how the H3K27M mediates the metabolic response to 
radiation and consequent treatment resistance is uncertain.
METHODS: We performed metabolomics on irradiated and untreated H3K27M isogenic 
DMG cell lines and observed an H3K27M-specific enrichment for purine synthesis 
pathways. We profiled the expression of purine synthesis enzymes in publicly 
available patient data and in our models, quantified purine synthetic flux using 
stable isotope tracing, and characterized the in vitro and in vivo response to 
de novo and salvage purine synthesis inhibition in combination with RT.
RESULTS: DMG-H3K27M cells activate purine metabolism in an H3K27M-specific 
fashion. In the absence of genotoxic treatment, H3K27M-expressing cells have 
higher relative activity of de novosynthesis and lower activity of purine 
salvage due to decreased expression of the purine salvage enzymes. Inhibition of 
de novo synthesis radiosensitized DMG-H3K27M cells in vitro and in vivo. 
Irradiated H3K27M cells adaptively upregulate purine salvage enzyme expression 
and pathway activity. Silencing the rate limiting enzyme in purine salvage, 
hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) when combined with 
radiation markedly suppressed DMG-H3K27M tumor growth in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: H3K27M expressing cells rely on de novo purine synthesis but 
adaptively upregulate purine salvage in response to RT. Inhibiting purine 
salvage may help overcome treatment resistance in DMG-H3K27M tumors.
