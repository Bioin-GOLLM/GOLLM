OBJECTIVES: To assess the virological outcomes, prevalence of HIV drug 
resistance mutation (DRM), and correlates in Butuo County.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study. Virological failure (VF) was 
defined as HIV-1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL and on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ≥6 
months. Genotypic drug resistance was performed among VF cases. Correlates of 
DRM were identified using multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: The overall virological suppression rate was 85.3%; DRM was detected in 
42.6% (517/1215) VF cases and 6.2% of the sample patients. A total of 90.9% of 
patients were infected with HIV-1 CRF07_BC subtype. The prevalence of DRM to 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) were 46.0% and 96.9%, respectively. The most 
prevalent mutation for NRTI was M184V (84.5%). Lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine 
(FTC), and abacavir (ABC) had the highest resistance rates. For NNRTI, K103N 
(60.7%), nevirapine (NVP), and efavirenz (EFV) had the highest resistance rates 
and cross resistance to rilpivirine (RPV), doravirine (DOR), and etravirine 
(ETR). Ritonavir boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) resistance rate was extremely low. 
The occurrence of DRM was associated with age at ART ≤18 years, baseline CD4 
count ≤200 cells/mL, NVP-based regimen, and ART duration >3 years.
CONCLUSION: A relatively high proportion of VF and broad DRM for NRTI and NNRTI 
were observed, causing high-level resistance to first-line NRTI, NNRTI, and next 
generation NNRTI. Our findings necessitate the implementation of scaling up 
virological monitoring, adherence support, and timely switching to an 
LPV/r-containing regimen when patients with VF to reduce the occurrence of DRM.
