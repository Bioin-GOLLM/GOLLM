Translation initiation defines the identity and quantity of a synthesized 
protein. The process is dysregulated in many human diseases1,2. A key commitment 
step is when the ribosomal subunits join at a translation start site on a 
messenger RNA to form a functional ribosome. Here, we combined single-molecule 
spectroscopy and structural methods using an in vitro reconstituted system to 
examine how the human ribosomal subunits join. Single-molecule fluorescence 
revealed when the universally conserved eukaryotic initiation factors eIF1A and 
eIF5B associate with and depart from initiation complexes. Guided by 
single-molecule dynamics, we visualized initiation complexes that contained both 
eIF1A and eIF5B using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The resulting 
structure revealed how eukaryote-specific contacts between the two proteins 
remodel the initiation complex to orient the initiator aminoacyl-tRNA in a 
conformation compatible with ribosomal subunit joining. Collectively, our 
findings provide a quantitative and architectural framework for the molecular 
choreography orchestrated by eIF1A and eIF5B during translation initiation in 
humans.
