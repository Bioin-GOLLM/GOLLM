AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin resistance is frequently associated with hypertension 
and type 2 diabetes. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) arachidonic acid epoxygenases 
(CYP2C, CYP2J) and their epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) products lower blood 
pressure and may also improve glucose homeostasis. However, the direct 
contribution of endogenous EET production on insulin sensitivity has not been 
previously investigated. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous 
CYP2C-derived EETs alter insulin sensitivity by analysing mice lacking CYP2C44, 
a major EET producing enzyme, and by testing the association of plasma EETs with 
insulin sensitivity in humans.
METHODS: We assessed insulin sensitivity in wild-type (WT) and Cyp2c44 -/- mice 
using hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps and isolated skeletal muscle. Insulin 
secretory function was assessed using hyperglycaemic clamps and isolated islets. 
Vascular function was tested in isolated perfused mesenteric vessels. Insulin 
sensitivity and secretion were assessed in humans using frequently sampled 
intravenous glucose tolerance tests and plasma EETs were measured by mass 
spectrometry.
RESULTS: Cyp2c44 -/- mice showed decreased glucose tolerance (639 ± 39.5 vs 
808 ± 37.7 mmol/l × min for glucose tolerance tests, p = 0.004) and insulin 
sensitivity compared with WT controls (hyperinsulinaemic clamp glucose infusion 
rate average during terminal 30 min 0.22 ± 0.02 vs 0.33 ± 0.01 mmol kg-1 min-1 
in WT and Cyp2c44 -/- mice respectively, p = 0.003). Although glucose uptake was 
diminished in Cyp2c44 -/- mice in vivo (gastrocnemius Rg 16.4 ± 2.0 vs 
6.2 ± 1.7 μmol 100 g-1 min-1, p < 0.01) insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was 
unchanged ex vivo in isolated skeletal muscle. Capillary density was similar but 
vascular KATP-induced relaxation was impaired in isolated Cyp2c44 -/- vessels 
(maximal response 39.3 ± 6.5% of control, p < 0.001), suggesting that impaired 
vascular reactivity produces impaired insulin sensitivity in vivo. Similarly, 
plasma EETs positively correlated with insulin sensitivity in human 
participants.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: CYP2C-derived EETs contribute to insulin sensitivity 
in mice and in humans. Interventions to increase circulating EETs in humans 
could provide a novel approach to improve insulin sensitivity and treat 
hypertension.
