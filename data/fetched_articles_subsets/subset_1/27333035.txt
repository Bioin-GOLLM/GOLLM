The innate immune protein Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) promotes the 
induction of interferon beta (IFN-β) production via the phosphorylation of its 
C-terminal tail (CTT) by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Potent ligands of STING 
are, therefore, promising candidates for novel anti-cancer drugs or vaccine 
adjuvants. However, the intrinsically flexible CTT poses serious problems in in 
silico drug discovery. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the 
STING fragment containing the CTT in ligand-bound and unbound forms and observed 
that the binding of a potent ligand cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) induced a local 
structure in the CTT, reminiscent of the known structure of a TBK1 substrate. 
The subsequent molecular biological experiments confirmed the observed dynamics 
of the CTT and identified essential residues for the activation of the IFN-β 
promoter, leading us to propose a new mechanism of STING activation.
