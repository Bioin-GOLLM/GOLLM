BPI fold containing family A, member 1 (BPIFA1) and BPIFB1 are putative innate 
immune molecules expressed in the upper airways. Because of their hypothesized 
roles in airway defense, these molecules may contribute to lung disease severity 
in cystic fibrosis (CF). We interrogated BPIFA1/BPIFB1 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms in data from an association study of CF modifier genes and found 
an association of the G allele of rs1078761 with increased lung disease severity 
(P = 2.71 × 10(-4)). We hypothesized that the G allele of rs1078761 is 
associated with decreased expression of BPIFA1 and/or BPIFB1. Genome-wide lung 
gene expression and genotyping data from 1,111 individuals with lung disease, 
including 51 patients with CF, were tested for associations between genotype and 
BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 gene expression levels. Findings were validated by 
quantitative PCR in a subset of 77 individuals. Western blotting was used to 
measure BPIFA1 and BPIFB1 protein levels in 93 lung and 101 saliva samples. The 
G allele of rs1078761 was significantly associated with decreased mRNA levels of 
BPIFA1 (P = 4.08 × 10(-15)) and BPIFB1 (P = 0.0314). These findings were 
confirmed with quantitative PCR and Western blotting. We conclude that the G 
allele of rs1078761 may be detrimental to lung function in CF owing to decreased 
levels of BPIFA1 and BPIFB1.
