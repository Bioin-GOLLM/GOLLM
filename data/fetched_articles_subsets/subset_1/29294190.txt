Fabry disease (FD) is a multi-systemic X-linked lysosomal disorder caused by the 
deficient activity of α-galactosidase-A enzyme, which leads to accumulation of 
glycosphingolipids in various body tissues. The N215S mutation is a known 
variant of FD, with a late onset cardiac phenotype. Consensus guidelines 
acknowledged the use of globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) as a diagnostic 
marker for classical FD but its utility for cardiac variant FD is not clear. We 
aim to characterize the clinical features and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy 
of plasma and urinary Lyso-Gb3 levels in N215S cardiac variant FD patients. 
Thirty-four FD patients with the late-onset N215S cardiac variant mutation were 
enrolled along with 62 classical FD patients and 109 healthy controls. Plasma 
and urinary Lyso-Gb3 and its analogues were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Both FD males 
and females with N215S mutation showed Lyso-Gb3 levels of (mean ± SEM) 9.7 ± 1.0 
and 5.4 ± 0.8 nM, respectively. These levels were significantly higher than 
healthy control and lower than classical FD patients (p < 0.0001). Plasma 
Lyso-Gb3 levels equal to or higher than 2.7 nM yielded a diagnostic sensitivity 
and specificity of 100% (AUC = 1, p < 0.0001). Cardiac involvement was frequent 
with 16/34 (47%) developing left ventricular hypertrophy. Three patients who 
underwent renal biopsy had the characteristic sphingolipid deposition in the 
podocytes while 6/19 (32%) had evidence of white matter changes or infarct on 
brain MRI. Taken together, cardiac variant N215S mutation is rather an 
attenuated form of classical FD. Plasma Lyso-Gb3 is a diagnostic hallmark to 
differentiate N215S variant phenotype from subjects with no FD.
