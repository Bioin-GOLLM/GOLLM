RATIONALE: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) X447 homozygotes are characterized by 
enhanced conversion of TRL apoB100. Here, we set out to investigate whether this 
LPL variant is also associated with enhanced apoB48 clearance. Therefore, we 
evaluated apoB48 kinetics in X447 homozygotes in the fed state by infusion of 
isotope L-[1-(13)C]-valine and subsequent compartmental modeling.
METHODS AND RESULTS: ApoB48 metabolism was assessed in five X447 homozygotes 
(X/X genotype) and five S447 homozygotes (S/S genotype). Subjects were 
continuously fed and received infusion of stable isotope L-[1-(13)C]-valine. 
Results were analyzed by SAAM II modeling. Fasting (2.4-fold, p=0.02) as well as 
non-fasting (1.6-fold, p=0.09) apoB48 concentration was increased in the X447 
homozygotes compared to S447 homozygotes. In addition, the X447 homozygotes 
exhibited a 1.7-fold higher apoB48 poolsize (p=0.04). Interestingly, apoB48 
fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was 1.9-fold higher (p=0.007) and apoB48 
synthesis was more than two-fold higher (p=0.006) in the X447 homozygotes 
compared to S447 homozygotes.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, we show that X447 homozygotes exhibit enhanced 
apoB48 clearance. Previously, these homozygotes were shown to present with 
enhanced apoB100 TRL conversion. Combined, this LPLS447X gain of function 
variant affects apoB48 as well as apoB100 TRL metabolism.
