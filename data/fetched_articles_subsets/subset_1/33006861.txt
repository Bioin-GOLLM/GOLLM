Conservation of genetic resources by semen cryopreservation is essential for 
biodiversity conservation and storage of rare poultry breeds. Despite the 
widespread use of this method not all individuals presentia similar capacity for 
semen to be used after defrosting. The aim of the current study was to identify 
SNP markers and linked candidate genes potentially associated with rooster 
(Gallus gallus) sperm motility after cryopreservation. Genome-wide association 
studies were performed using 33 roosters from four breeds genotyped using 
Illumina Chicken 60K SNP BeadChip Calculations were performed using PLINK and 
EMMAX software. Significant SNP associations rs15557972 (p⟨1.36E-07) on 
chromosome 10 in the LOXL1 gene and rs15751385 (p⟨6.10E-06) on chromosome 6 in 
the intron of the ENSGALG00000052127 gene were identified. These findings 
associated with sperm motility SNPs will help to develop strategies for the 
selection of valuable individuals and the efficient conservation of the gene 
pool.
