BACKGROUND: Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) includes four different subtypes (IgG1, 
IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), and it is also now appreciated that there are genetic 
variations within IgG subtypes (called isoallotypes). Twenty-nine different 
isoallotypes have been described, with 7, 4, 15, and 3 isoallotypes described 
for IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, respectively. The reactivity of anti-IgG with 
different isoallotypes has not been characterized.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A novel monoclonal anti-K antibody (PugetSound 
Monoclonal Antibody 1 [PUMA1]) was isolated and sequenced, and a panel of PUMA1 
variants was expressed, consisting of the 29 known IgG isoallotypes. The 
resulting panel of antibodies was preincubated with K-positive red blood cells 
(RBCs) and then subjected to testing with currently approved anti-IgG by flow 
cytometry, solid phase systems, gel cards, and tube testing.
RESULTS: A US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal anti-IgG 
(gamma-clone) failed to recognize 2 of 15 IgG3 isoallotypes (IgG3-03 and 
IgG3-13) and 3 of 3 IgG4 isoallotypes (IgG4-01, IgG4-02, and IgG4-03). In 
contrast, an FDA-approved rabbit polyclonal anti-IgG recognized each of the 
known human IgG isoallotypes.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate "blind spots" in isoalloantibody 
detection by a monoclonal anti-IgG. If a patient has anti-RBC antibodies 
predominantly of an IgG3 subtype (the IgG3-03 and/or IgG3-13 variety), then it 
is possible that a clinically significant alloantibody would be missed. IgG-03 
and IgG-13 have an estimated frequency of 1% to 3% in Caucasian populations and 
20% to 30% in certain African populations. Nonreactivity with IgG4 is a known 
characteristic of this monoclonal anti-IgG, but IgG4 isoallotypes have not been 
previously reported.
