It has been only 5 years since the identification of TDP-43 as the major protein 
component of the ubiquitinated inclusions in FTLD-U. At that time, there were 
approximately a dozen papers about TDP-43; today, a "TDP-43" search reveals 
almost 600 papers. It is now clear that the majority of FTLD cases containing 
tau- and alpha-synuclein-negative, ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) are 
FTLD-TDP. The spectrum of TDP-43 proteinopathies includes FTLD-TDP with or 
without ALS, with or without mutations in GRN, VCP, or TARDBP, with or without 
chromosome 9p linkage, and sporadic and non-SOD1 familial ALS with or without 
FTLD-TDP. There are four sub-types of FTLD-TDP, and these correlate with 
specific clinical and genetic profiles. Sub-types are determined by the 
presence, predominance, and distribution of the various TDP-43 immunopositive 
insoluble aggregates-neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, neuronal intranuclear 
inclusions, and dystrophic neurites. In this paper, FTLD-TDP pathologic 
sub-types will be described, and examples of each sub-type will be shown, and 
implications for future research will be discussed.
