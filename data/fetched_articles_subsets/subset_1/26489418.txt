BACKGROUND: The defensive capacities of plant protease Inhibitors (PI) rely on 
inhibition of proteases in insect guts or those secreted by microorganisms; and 
also prevent uncontrolled proteolysis and offer protection against proteolytic 
enzymes of pathogens.
METHODS: An array of chromatographic techniques were employed for purification, 
homogeneity was assessed by electrophoresis. Specificity, Ki value, nature of 
inhibition, complex formation was carried out by standard protocols. Action of 
SNTI on insect gut proteases was computationally evaluated by modeling the 
proteins by threading and docking studies by piper using Schrodinger tools.
RESULTS: We have isolated and purified Soap Nut Trypsin Inhibitor (SNTI) by 
acetone fractionation, ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion exchange and gel 
permeation chromatography. The purified inhibitor was homogeneous by both gel 
filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). SNTI exhibited a 
molecular weight of 29 kDa on SDS-PAGE, gel filtration and was negative to 
Periodic Acid Schiff's stain. SNTI inhibited trypsin and pronase of serine 
class. SNTI demonstrated non-competitive inhibition with a Ki value of 
0.75 ± 0.05×10-10 M. The monoheaded inhibitor formed a stable complex in 1:1 
molar ratio. Action of SNTI was computationally evaluated on larval gut 
proteases from Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera frugiperda. SNTI and larval 
gut proteases were modeled and docked using Schrodinger software. Docking 
studies revealed strong hydrogen bond interactions between Lys10 and Pro71, 
Lys299 and Met80 and Van Der Waals interactions between Leu11 and Cys76amino 
acid residues of SNTI and protease from H. Armigera. Strong hydrogen bonds were 
observed between SNTI and protease of S. frugiperda at positions Thr79 and 
Arg80, Asp90 and Gly73, Asp2 and Gly160 respectively.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that SNTI potentially inhibits larval gut proteases of 
insects and the kinetics exhibited by the protease inhibitor further 
substantiates its efficacy against serine proteases.
