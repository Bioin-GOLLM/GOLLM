In this study, a biosensor, based on a glucose oxidase (GOx) immobilized, 
carbon-coated tin sulfide (SnS) assembled on a glass carbon electrode (GCE) was 
developed, and its direct electrochemistry was investigated. The carbon coated 
SnS (C-SnS) nanoparticle was prepared through a simple two-step process, using 
hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition methods. The large reactive surface 
area and unique electrical potential of C-SnS could offer a favorable 
microenvironment for facilitating electron transfer between enzymes and the 
electrode surface. The structure and sensor ability of the proposed GOx/C-SnS 
electrode were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray 
diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and cyclic voltammetry study (CV).
