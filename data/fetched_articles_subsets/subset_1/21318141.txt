Primary hyperparathyroidism may occur as a part of an inherited syndrome in a 
combination with pancreatic endocrine tumours and/or pituitary adenoma, which is 
classified as Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1). This syndrome is 
caused by a germline mutation in MEN-1 gene encoding a tumour-suppressor 
protein, menin. Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most frequent clinical 
presentation of MEN-1, which usually appears in the second decade of life as an 
asymptomatic hypercalcemia and progresses through the next decades. The most 
frequent clinical presentation of MEN-1-associated primary hyperparathyroidism 
is bone demineralisation and recurrent kidney stones rarely followed by chronic 
kidney disease. The aim of this paper is to present the pathomechanism, 
screening procedures, diagnosis, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism 
in the MEN-1 syndrome. It also summarises the recent advances in the 
pharmacological therapy with a new group of drugs-calcimimetics.
