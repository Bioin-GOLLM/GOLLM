Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are predominantly initiated by KIT 
mutations. In this study, we observed that discoidin domain receptors 1 and 2 
(DDR1 and DDR2) exhibited high expression in GISTs, were associated with KIT, 
and enhanced the activation of both wild-type KIT and primary KIT mutants. 
Inhibition of DDR1/2 led to a reduction in the activation of KIT and its 
downstream signaling molecules, ultimately impairing GIST cell survival and 
proliferation in vitro. Consequently, treatment of mice carrying germline 
KIT/V558A mutation with DDR1/2 inhibitor significantly impeded tumor growth, and 
the combined use of DDR1/2 inhibitor and imatinib, the first-line targeted 
therapeutic agent for GISTs, markedly enhanced tumor growth suppression. In 
addition, DDR1/2 inhibition resulted in decreased KIT expression, while KIT 
inhibition led to upregulation of DDR1/2 expression in GISTs. The presence of 
DDR1/2 also decreased the sensitivity of wild-type KIT or primary KIT mutants to 
imatinib, indicating a possible role for DDR1/2 in promoting GIST survival 
during KIT-targeted therapy. The development of drug-resistant secondary KIT 
mutations is a primary factor contributing to GIST recurrence following targeted 
therapy. Similar to primary KIT mutants, DDR1/2 can associate with and enhance 
the activation of secondary KIT mutants, further diminishing their sensitivity 
to imatinib. In summary, our data demonstrate that DDR1/2 contribute to KIT 
activation in GISTs and strengthen resistance to imatinib for both primary and 
secondary KIT mutants, providing a rationale for further exploration of DDR1/2 
targeting in GIST treatment.
