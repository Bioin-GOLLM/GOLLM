OBJECTIVE: The BRAFV600E mutation is the universal genetic mutation in papillary 
thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC). The present study is to estimate the role of the 
BRAFV600E mutation in the clinical outcome of PTMC with intermediate to high 
recurrence risk after radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, which is considered to 
be an indolent tumor.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study. Between May 2016 and 
March 2019, PTMC patients with known BRAFV600E status who received RAI therapy 
were reviewed at the Second Hospital of Shandong University. Treatment and 
follow-up were defined according to criteria used in the 2015 ATA guidelines. 
The association between the BRAFV600E mutation and clinicopathological 
characteristics, response to RAI therapy, and recurrence after a period of 
follow-up were analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) and logistic regression 
were used to control confounding variables.
RESULTS: Of the 322 patients with intermediate to high recurrence risk in PTMC, 
the mean age of the patients were 43.7 ± 12.2 years, and 72.1% were women. 
BRAFV600E mutation was found in 64.9% (209/322). After PSM, 112 pairs of 
patients were matched, and except for multifocality (P = 0.001), extrathyroidal 
invasion (P = 0.003) and tumor size (P = 0.03), there was no significant 
difference in all baseline characteristics between the two groups. An excellent 
response (ER) to RAI therapy was observed in 273 patients (84.7%). At the end of 
the study, 17(5.2%) and 6(1.8%) patients showed structural incomplete response 
(SIR) and biochemical incomplete response (BIR) status. The proportion of 
patients who achieved ER status in the BRAFV600E mutation positive and negative 
groups was 86.6% and 81.4%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that the 
BRAFV600E mutation was not related to lower ER reached time. The median 
follow-up was 51 months.
CONCLUSIONS: We found the BRAFV600E mutation was associated with multifocality, 
extrathyroidal invasion, and tumor size in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. 
However, the BRAFV600E mutation had no significant association with clinical 
outcomes in patients with intermediate to high recurrence risk after RAI 
therapy. Furthermore, the extra-thyroid uptake results and distant metastasis 
had been proven to be independent factor predicting the clinical response.
