BACKGROUND: IDH-mutant glioblastoma is classified by the 2016 CNS WHO as a group 
with good prognosis. However, the actual number of cases examined in the 
literature is relatively small. We hypothesize that IDH-mutant glioblastoma is 
not a uniform group and should be further stratified.
METHODS: We conducted methylation profiles and estimated copy number variations 
of 57 IDH-mutant glioblastomas.
RESULTS: Our results showed that 59.6% and 40.4% of tumors belonged to 
glioma-CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP)-high and G-CIMP-low methylation 
subgroups, respectively. G-CIMP-low subgroup was associated with significantly 
worse overall survival (OS) as compared to G-CIMP-high (P = .005). CDKN2A 
deletion (42.1%) was the most common gene copy number variation, and was 
significantly associated with G-CIMP-low subgroup (P = .004). Other frequent 
copy number changes included mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) (5.3%), 
CCND2 (19.3%), PDGFRA (14.0%), CDK4 (12.3%), and EGFR (12.3%) amplification. 
Both CDKN2A deletion (P = .036) and MET amplification (P < .001) were associated 
with poor OS in IDH-mutant glioblastomas. Combined epigenetic signature and gene 
copy number variations separated IDH-mutant glioblastomas into Group 1 
(G-CIMP-high), Group 2 (G-CIMP-low without CDKN2A nor MET alteration), and Group 
3 (G-CIMP-low with CDKN2A and/or MET alteration). Survival analysis revealed 
Groups 1 and 2 exhibited a favorable OS (median survival: 619 d [20.6 mo] and 
655 d [21.8 mo], respectively). Group 3 exhibited a significant shorter OS 
(median survival: 252 d [8.4 mo]). Multivariable analysis confirmed the 
independent prognostic significance of our Groups.
CONCLUSIONS: IDH-mutant glioblastomas should be stratified for risk with 
combined epigenetic signature and CDKN2A/MET status and some cases have poor 
outcome.
