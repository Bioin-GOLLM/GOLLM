The relationship between diet and cancer is often viewed with skepticism by the 
public and health professionals, despite a considerable body of evidence and 
general consistency in recommendations over the past decades. A systems biology 
approach which integrates 'omics' data including metabolomics, genetics, 
metagenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics holds promise for developing a 
better understanding of how diet affects cancer and for improving the assessment 
of diet through biomarker discovery thereby renewing confidence in diet-cancer 
links. This review discusses the application of multi-omics approaches to 
studies of diet and cancer. Considerations and challenges that need to be 
addressed to facilitate the investigation of diet-cancer relationships with 
multi-omic approaches are also discussed.
