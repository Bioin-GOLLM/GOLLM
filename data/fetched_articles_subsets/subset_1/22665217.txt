OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a survey of general and 
diabetes-specific nutrition knowledge for youth with type 1 diabetes and their 
parents and to assess the survey's psychometric properties.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary pediatric team developed the 
Nutrition Knowledge Survey (NKS) and administered it to youth with type 1 
diabetes (n = 282, 49% females, 13.3 ± 2.9 years) and their parents (82% 
mothers). The NKS content domains included healthful eating, carbohydrate 
counting, blood glucose response to foods, and nutrition label reading. Higher 
NKS scores reflect greater nutrition knowledge (score range is 0-100%). In 
youths, glycemic control was assessed by A1C, and dietary quality was determined 
by the Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005) derived from 3-day diet records. 
Validity was based on associations of NKS scores with A1C and dietary quality. 
Reliability was assessed using the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) and 
correlations of domain scores to total score.
RESULTS: Mean NKS scores (23 items) were 56.9 ± 16.4% for youth and 73.4 ± 12.5% 
for parents. The KR-20 was 0.70 for youth and 0.59 for parents, representing 
acceptable internal consistency of the measure. In multivariate analysis, 
controlling for youth age, family income, parent education, diabetes duration, 
and insulin regimen, parent NKS scores were associated with corresponding youth 
A1C (β = -0.13, P = 0.03). Both parent (β = 0.20, P = 0.002) and youth (β = 
0.25, P < 0.001) NKS scores were positively associated with youth HEI-2005 
scores.
CONCLUSIONS: The NKS appears to be a useful measure of general and 
diabetes-specific nutrition knowledge for youth with type 1 diabetes and their 
parents.
