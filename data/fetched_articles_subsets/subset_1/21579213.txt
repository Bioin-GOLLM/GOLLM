The title compound, C(15)H(15)N(3)O, was obtained by a condensation reaction 
between o-amino-acetophenone and benzoyl hydrazine. The mol-ecule displays an E 
configuration about the C=N bond. Intra-molecular N-H⋯N hydrogen bonds are 
formed between the 2-amino-phenyl and imine groups. In the crystal, dimers are 
formed between mol-ecules linked by inter-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds from 
the 2-amino-phenyl group. In addition there are inter-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen 
bonds between the amine and carbonyl groups of adjacent mol-ecules. The 
mol-ecule is twisted rather than planar due to a steric inter-action between the 
central amide group and the two outer benzene rings. The dihedral angles between 
this central group and the two rings are 23.29 (9) and 24.96 (9)°.
