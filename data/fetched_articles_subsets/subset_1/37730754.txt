The genomic spectrum of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) progression from primary to 
relapse is not fully understood. In this pilot study, we explore the sensitivity 
of various targeted and whole-genome NGS platforms in order to assess the best 
genomic approach of using liquid biopsy in future prospective clinical trials. 
Moreover, we investigate 35 paired primary/relapsed RMS from two contributing 
institutions, 18 fusion-positive (FP-RMS) and 17 fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) by 
either targeted DNA or whole exome sequencing (WES). In 10 cases, circulating 
tumor DNA (ctDNA) from multiple timepoints through clinical care and progression 
was analyzed for feasibility of liquid biopsy in monitoring treatment 
response/relapse. ctDNA alterations were evaluated using a targeted 36-gene 
custom RMS panel at high coverage for single-nucleotide variation and fusion 
detection, and a shallow whole-genome sequencing for copy number variation. 
FP-RMS have a stable genome with relapse, with common secondary alterations 
CDKN2A/B, MYCN, and CDK4 present at diagnosis and impacting survival. FP-RMS 
lacking major secondary events at baseline acquire recurrent MYCN and AKT1 
alterations. FN-RMS acquire a higher number of new alterations, most commonly 
SMARCA2 missense mutations. ctDNA analyses detect pathognomonic variants in all 
RMS patients within our collection at diagnosis, regardless of type of 
alterations, and confirmed at relapse in 86% of FP-RMS and 100% FN-RMS. 
Moreover, a higher number of fusion reads is detected with increased disease 
burden and at relapse in patients following a fatal outcome. These results 
underscore patterns of tumor progression and provide rationale for using liquid 
biopsy to monitor treatment response.
