The sugar nucleotide dTDP-L-rhamnose is critical for the biosynthesis of the 
Group A Carbohydrate, the molecular signature and virulence determinant of the 
human pathogen Group A Streptococcus (GAS). The final step of the four-step 
dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway is catalyzed by dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 
reductases (RmlD). RmlD from the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella is the only 
structurally characterized family member and requires metal-dependent 
homo-dimerization for enzymatic activity. Using a biochemical and structural 
biology approach, we demonstrate that the only RmlD homologue from GAS, 
previously renamed GacA, functions in a novel monomeric manner. Sequence 
analysis of 213 Gram-negative and Gram-positive RmlD homologues predicts that 
enzymes from all Gram-positive species lack a dimerization motif and function as 
monomers. The enzymatic function of GacA was confirmed through heterologous 
expression of gacA in a S. mutans rmlD knockout, which restored attenuated 
growth and aberrant cell division. Finally, analysis of a saturated mutant GAS 
library using Tn-sequencing and generation of a conditional-expression mutant 
identified gacA as an essential gene for GAS. In conclusion, GacA is an 
essential monomeric enzyme in GAS and representative of monomeric RmlD enzymes 
in Gram-positive bacteria and a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. These results 
will help future screens for novel inhibitors of dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis.
