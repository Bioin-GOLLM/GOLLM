A hypermutated subtype of advanced prostate cancer was recently described, but 
prevalence and mechanisms have not been well-characterized. Here we find that 
12% (7 of 60) of advanced prostate cancers are hypermutated, and that all 
hypermutated cancers have mismatch repair gene mutations and microsatellite 
instability (MSI). Mutations are frequently complex MSH2 or MSH6 structural 
rearrangements rather than MLH1 epigenetic silencing. Our findings identify 
parallels and differences in the mechanisms of hypermutation in prostate cancer 
compared with other MSI-associated cancers.
