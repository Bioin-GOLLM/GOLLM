Congenital skin fragility is a heterogeneous disorder with epidermolysis bullosa 
and various skin infections as the leading causes. However, even rare diseases 
must be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal skin blistering, 
including some genetic syndromes with extracutaneous involvement. One such 
syndrome is ectodermal dysplasia due to deficiency of desmoplakin, a desmosomal 
protein essential for cellular cohesion in both epithelia and cardiac tissues. 
Desmoplakin is encoded by the DSP gene, which is localized on chromosome 6p24. 
Both dominant and recessive mutations in this gene have been reported to cause 
skin fragility and keratinization defects. We report a child born with a fragile 
epidermis, alopecia, thick nails, and focal hyperkeratoses on the digits and 
knees. She was found to have a deficiency of desmoplakin caused by compound 
heterozygous DSP mutations. She has gradually developed signs of a left 
ventricular cardiomyopathy.
