Laminin-γ1 is required for early embryonic development; however, the need for 
laminin-γ1 synthesis in adulthood is unknown. A global and inducible mouse model 
of laminin-γ1 deficiency was generated to address this question. Genetic 
ablation of the Lamc1 gene in adult mice was rapidly lethal. Despite global 
Lamc1 gene deletion in tamoxifen-induced mutant mice, there was minimal change 
in total cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal laminin protein. In contrast, 
laminin-γ1 was significantly depleted in the small intestines, which showed 
crypt hyperplasia and dissociation of villous epithelium from adjacent 
mesenchyme. We conclude that the physiologic requirement for laminin-γ1 
synthesis in adult mice is dependent on a tissue-specific basal rate of 
laminin-γ1 turnover that results in rapid depletion of laminin-γ1 in the 
intestine.
