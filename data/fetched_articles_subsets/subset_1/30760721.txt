Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) represent a promising alternative to 
antiretroviral drugs for HIV-1 prevention and treatment. Selected antibodies to 
the CD4-binding site bolster envelope trimer binding via quaternary contacts. 
Here, we rationally engraft a new paratope, i.e., the extended heavy-chain 
framework region 3 (FR3) loop of VRC03, which mediates quaternary interaction, 
onto several potent bNAbs, enabling them to reach an adjacent gp120 protomer. 
The interactive quaternary surface is delineated by solving the crystal 
structure of two FR3 loop-chimeric antibodies. Chimerization enhances the 
neutralizing activity of several potent bNAbs against a majority of global HIV-1 
strains. Compared to unmodified antibodies, chimeric antibodies display lower 
autoreactivity and prolonged in vivo half-life in huFcRn mice and rhesus 
macaques. Thus, paratope engraftment may be used to expand the epitope repertory 
of natural antibodies, improving their functionality for disease prevention and 
treatment.
