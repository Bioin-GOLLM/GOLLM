A subset of patients with melanoma present in rare and unique clinical 
circumstances requiring specific considerations with respect to diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions. Herein, we present our review of patients with: (1) 
primary mucosal melanoma of the head and neck, gastrointestinal, and 
genitourinary tracts; (2) primary melanoma of the eye; (3) desmoplastic 
melanoma; (4) subungual melanoma; (5) melanoma in special populations: children, 
nonwhites, as well as a discussion of familial melanoma.
