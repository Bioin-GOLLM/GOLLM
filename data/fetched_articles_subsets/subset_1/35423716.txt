We report a method to equip proteolytic nanobiocatalysts with intrinsic 
disulphide bond reducing properties. After immobilisation onto silica particles, 
selected protease enzymes are partially shielded in a nanometre-thick 
mercaptosilica layer acting not only as a protective system but also as a 
substrate reducing agent. The biocatalysts produced efficiently perform 
simultaneous disulphide bond reduction and protein digestion. Besides a 
significant simplification of the proteolysis process, this strategy allows for 
a drastic increase of the enzyme stability.
