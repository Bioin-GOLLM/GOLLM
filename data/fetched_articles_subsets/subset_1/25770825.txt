There is a need to develop a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test that is 
noninvasive, cost effective, and sensitive enough to detect preneoplastic 
lesions. This case-control study examined the feasibility of using circulating 
extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) to differentiate a spectrum of colorectal 
neoplasia of various severity and hence for early detection of colorectal 
neoplasia. Archived serum samples of 10 normal controls and 31 cases, including 
10 with nonadvanced adenoma, 10 with advanced adenoma, and 11 with CRC, were 
profiled for circulating miRNAs using next-generation sequencing. Multiple 
linear regression, adjusting for age, gender, and smoking status, compared 
controls and the 3 case groups for levels of 175 miRNAs that met stringent 
criteria for miRNA sequencing analysis. Of the 175 miRNAs, 106 miRNAs were 
downregulated according to severity of neoplasia and showed a relative decrease 
in the expression from controls to nonadvanced adenoma to advanced adenoma to 
CRC (Ptrend < 0.05). Pairwise group comparisons showed that 39 and 80 miRNAs 
were differentially expressed in the advanced adenoma and CRC groups compared 
with the controls, respectively. Differences in miRNA levels between the 
nonadvanced adenoma group and controls were modest. Our study found that 
expression of many miRNAs in serum was inversely correlated with the severity of 
colorectal neoplasia, and differential miRNA profiles were apparent in 
preneoplastic cases with advanced lesions, suggesting circulating miRNAs could 
serve as potential biomarkers for CRC screening.
