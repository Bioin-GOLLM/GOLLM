The epigenome defines the unique gene expression patterns and resulting cellular 
behaviors in different cell types. Epigenome dysregulation has been directly 
linked to various human diseases. Epigenome editing enabling genome 
locus-specific targeting of epigenome modifiers to directly alter specific local 
epigenome modifications offers a revolutionary tool for mechanistic studies in 
epigenome regulation as well as the development of novel epigenome therapies. 
Inducible and reversible epigenome editing provides unique temporal control 
critical for understanding the dynamics and kinetics of epigenome regulation. 
This review summarizes the progress in the development of 
spatiotemporal-specific tools using small molecules or light as inducers to 
achieve the conditional control of epigenome editing and their applications in 
epigenetic research.
