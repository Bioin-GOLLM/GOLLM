Damage to the atrioventricular conduction system (AVCS), the main electrical 
connection between the atrial and ventricular chambers, can result in a variety 
of cardiac conduction disorders. Here, we provide a protocol for selective 
damage of the mouse AVCS to study its response during injury. We describe 
tamoxifen-induced cellular ablation, detection of AV block through 
electrocardiography, and quantification of histological and immunofluorescence 
markers to analyze the AVCS. This protocol can be used to study mechanisms 
associated with AVCS injury repair and regeneration. For complete details on the 
use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Wang et al. (2021).1.
