We describe a family with severe progressive cerebellar ataxia involving the 
trunk, the extremities, and speech. The proband, who has prominent atrophy of 
the cerebellum, shown by magnetic resonance imaging, was confined to a 
wheelchair at the age of 44 years. Two sons have episodes of vertigo and ataxia 
that are not responsive to acetazolamide. Quantitative eye-movement testing 
showed a consistent pattern of abnormalities localizing to the cerebellum. 
Genotyping suggested linkage to chromosome 19p, and SSCP showed an aberrant 
migrating fragment in exon 6 of the calcium-channel gene CACNA1A, which 
cosegregated with the disease. Sequencing of exon 6 identified a G-->A 
transposition in one allele, at nucleotide 1152, resulting in a predicted 
glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 293. The CAG-repeat expansion 
associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 6 was not present in any family members. 
This family is unique in having a non-CAG-repeat mutation that leads to severe 
progressive ataxia. Since a great deal is known about the function of calcium 
channels, we speculate on how this missense mutation leads to the combination of 
clinical symptoms and signs.
