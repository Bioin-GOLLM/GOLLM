Regions of hypoxia occur in most tumors and are a predictor of poor patient 
prognosis. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) provide an ideal strategy to target 
the aggressive, hypoxic, fraction of a tumor, while protecting the normal tissue 
from toxicity. A key challenge associated with the development of novel HAPs, 
however, is the ability to visualize the delivery of the prodrug to hypoxic 
regions and determine where it has been activated. Here, we report a modified 
version of the commonly used nitroimidazole bioreductive group that incorporates 
the fluoroethyl epitope of the antibody-based hypoxia imaging agent, EF5. 
Attachment of this group to the red fluorescent dye, dicyanomethylene (DCM), 
enabled us to correlate the release of the DCM dye with imaging of the reduced 
bioreductive group using the EF5 antibody. This study confirmed that the 
antibody was imaging reduction and fragmentation of the pro-fluorophore. We next 
employed the modified bioreductive group to synthesize a new prodrug of the KDAC 
inhibitor Panobinostat, EF5-Pano. Release of EF5-Pano in hypoxic multiple 
myeloma cells was imaged using the EF5 antibody, and the presence of an imaging 
signal correlated with apoptosis and a reduction in cell viability. Therefore, 
EF5-Pano is an imageable HAP with a proven cytotoxic effect in multiple myeloma, 
which could be utilized in future in vivo experiments.
