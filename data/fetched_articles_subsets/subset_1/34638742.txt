Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and deadliest primary brain cancer in 
adults, justifying the search for new treatments. Some members of the iron-based 
ferrocifen family have demonstrated a high cytotoxic effect on various cancer 
cell lines via innovative mechanisms of action. Here, we evaluated the 
antiproliferative activity by wst-1 assay of six ferrocifens in 15 molecularly 
diverse GBM patient-derived cell lines (PDCLs). In five out of six compounds, 
the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values varied significantly (10 
nM < IC50 < 29.8 µM) while the remaining one (the tamoxifen-like complex) was 
highly cytotoxic against all PDCLs (mean IC50 = 1.28 µM). The pattern of 
response was comparable for the four ferrocifens bearing at least one phenol 
group and differed widely from those of the tamoxifen-like complex and the 
complex with no phenol group. An RNA sequencing differential analysis showed 
that response to the diphenol ferrocifen relied on the activation of the Death 
Receptor signaling pathway and the modulation of FAS expression. Response to 
this complex was greater in PDCLs from the Mesenchymal or Proneural 
transcriptomic subtypes compared to the ones from the Classical subtype. These 
results provide new information on the mechanisms of action of ferrocifens and 
highlight a broader diversity of behavior than previously suspected among 
members of this family. They also support the case for a molecular-based 
personalized approach to future use of ferrocifens in the treatment of GBM.
