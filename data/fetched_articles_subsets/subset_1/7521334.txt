Members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily transport a 
variety of substances across biological membranes, including drugs, ions, and 
peptides. The yeast cadmium factor (YCF1) gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is 
required for cadmium resistance and encodes a 1,515 amino acid protein with 
extensive homology to both the human multidrug resistance-associated protein 
(MRP1) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR). S. 
cerevisiae cells harboring a deletion of the YCF1 gene are hypersensitive to 
cadmium compared with wild type cells. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that 
conserved amino acid residues, functionally critical in hCFTR, play a vital role 
in YCF1-mediated cadmium resistance. Mutagenesis of phenylalanine 713 in the 
YCF1 nucleotide binding fold 1, which correlates with the delta F508 mutation 
found in the most common form of cystic fibrosis, completely abolished YCF1 
function in cadmium detoxification. Furthermore, substitution of a serine to 
alanine residue in a potential protein kinase A phosphorylation site in a 
central region of YCF1, which displays sequence similarity to the central 
regulatory domain of hCFTR, also rendered YCF1 nonfunctional. These results 
suggest that YCF1 is composed of modular domains found in human proteins which 
function in drug and ion transport.
