The genome of the chlorarchiniophyte Bigelowiella natans codes for a protein 
annotated as an α-actinin-like protein. Analysis of the primary sequence 
indicate that this protein has the same domain structure as other α-actinins, a 
N-terminal actin-binding domain and a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain. These 
two domains are connected by a short rod domain, albeit long enough to form a 
single spectrin repeat. To analyse the functional properties of this protein, 
the full-length protein as well as the separate domains were cloned and 
isolated. Characerisation showed that the protein is capable of cross-linking 
actin filaments into dense bundles, probably due to dimer formation. Similar to 
human α-actinin, calcium-binding occurs to the most N-terminal EF-hand motif in 
the calmodulin-like C-terminal domain. The results indicate that this 
Bigelowiella protein is a proper α-actinin, with all common characteristics of a 
typical α-actinin.
