Nuclear import receptors ensure the recognition and transport of proteins across 
the nuclear envelope into the nucleus. In addition, as diverse processes as 
mitosis, post-translational modifications at mitotic exit, ciliogenesis, and 
phase separation, all share a common need for regulation by nuclear import 
receptors - particularly importin beta-1 and importin beta-2/transportin - 
independent on nuclear import. In particular, 1) nuclear import receptors 
regulate the mitotic spindle after nuclear envelope breakdown, 2) they shield 
cargoes from unscheduled ubiquitination, regulating their timely proteolysis; 3) 
they regulate ciliary factors, crucial to cell communications and tissue 
architecture during development; and 4) they prevent phase separation of toxic 
proteins aggregates in neurons. The balance of nuclear import receptors to 
cargoes is critical in all these processes, albeit in opposite directions: 
overexpression of import receptors, as often found in cancer, inhibits cargoes 
and impairs downstream processes, motivating the therapeutic design of specific 
inhibitors. On the contrary, elevated expression is beneficial in neuronal 
contexts, where nuclear import receptors are regarded as potential therapeutic 
tools in counteracting the formation of aggregates that may cause 
neurodegeneration. This paradox demonstrates the amplitude of nuclear import 
receptors-dependent functions in different contexts and adds complexity in 
considering their therapeutic implications.
