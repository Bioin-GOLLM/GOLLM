BACKGROUND: The FcgammaRIIA gene is expressed in two polymorphic forms, R131 and 
H131, which differ by the replacement of histidine by arginine at position 131. 
The FCGR3B (FcgammaRIIIB) gene exists in two allelic isoforms, known as FCGR3B1 
(FcgammaRIIIB-NA1) and FCGR3B2 (FcgammaRIIIB-NA2), which differ in nucleotides 
141, 147, 227, 277, and 349. An additional polymorphism is the SH antigen that 
is associated with the FCGR3B3 (FcgammaRIIIB-SH) allele.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: By use of a PCR with allele-specific primers, the 
allelic polymorphisms of FcgammaRIIA and FcgammaRIIIB were determined among 263 
unrelated Brazilian subjects, including Amazon Indians (n = 92), blood donors (n 
= 85), and patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) (n = 86).
RESULTS: Amazon Indians had a significantly higher frequency of the R131 allele 
than did blood donors and SCD patients (0.91 vs. 0.55 vs. 0.55; p<0.001). NA1 
and NA2 gene frequencies were found to be 0.67 and 0.21 for Amazon Indians, 0.58 
and 0.42 for blood donors, and 0.61 and 0.39 for SCD patients, respectively. The 
FcgammaRIIIB-SH allele was absent from the Amazon Indians, but 9 (10.6%) blood 
donors and 10 (11.6%) SCD patients expressed this allele.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the data indicate that the distribution of the FcgammaRIIIB 
alleles is significantly different in Amazon Indians from the distribution in 
Brazilian blood donors or African Brazilian patients with SCD, but that it is 
similar to the distributions reported in Asian populations. Moreover, the 
distribution of the FcgammaRIIA and FcgammaRIIIB alleles among Brazilian blood 
donors and SCD patients is comparable to the distributions reported in whites 
from the United States and Europe.
