We characterized the complete genome of a putative novel Usutu virus (USUV) 
strain (Usutu-BONN) detected in a dead blackbird from Germany. Genomic analysis 
revealed several unique amino acid substitutions among the polyprotein gene. 
Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that Usutu-BONN constitutes a putative novel 
African USUV lineage, which was probably recently introduced to central Europe.
