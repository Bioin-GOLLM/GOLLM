BACKGROUND: Adenylate kinase is a key enzyme in the high-energy phosphoryl 
transfer reaction in living cells. An isoform of this enzyme, adenylate kinase 4 
(AK4), is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and is believed to be involved 
in stress, drug resistance, malignant transformation in cancer, and ATP 
regulation. However, the molecular basis for the AK4 functions remained to be 
determined.
METHODS: HeLa cells were transiently transfected with an AK4 small interfering 
RNA (siRNA), an AK4 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmid, a control shRNA plasmid, 
an AK4 expression vector, and a control expression vector to examine the effect 
of the AK4 expression on cell proliferation, sensitivity to anti-cancer drug, 
metabolome, gene expression, and mitochondrial activity.
RESULTS: AK4 knockdown cells treated with short hairpin RNA increased ATP 
production and showed greater sensitivity to hypoxia and anti-cancer drug, 
cis-diamminedichloro-platinum (II) (CDDP). Subcutaneous grafting AK4 knockdown 
cells into nude mice revealed that the grafted cells exhibited both slower 
proliferation and reduced the tumor sizes in response to CDDP. AK4 knockdown 
cell showed a increased oxygen consumption rate with FCCP treatment, while AK4 
overexpression lowered it. Metabolome analysis showed the increased levels of 
the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, fumarate and malate in AK4 knockdown 
cells, while AK4 overexpression lowered them. Electron microscopy detected the 
increased mitochondrial numbers in AK4 knockdown cells. Microarray analysis 
detected the increased gene expression of two key enzymes in TCA cycle, 
succinate dehydrogenase A (SDHA) and oxoglutarate dehydrogenease L (OGDHL), 
which are components of SDH complex and OGDH complex, supporting the metabolomic 
results.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that AK4 was involved in hypoxia tolerance, resistance to 
anti-tumor drug, and the regulation of mitochondrial activity. These findings 
provide a new potential target for efficient anticancer therapies by controlling 
AK4 expression.
