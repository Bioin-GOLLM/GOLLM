Genomic studies conducted by different centers have uncovered various new genes 
mutated in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) at germline, mosaic, 
and/or somatic levels, greatly expanding our knowledge of the genetic events 
occurring in these tumors. The current review focuses on very new findings and 
discusses the previously not recognized role of MERTK, MET, fibroblast growth 
factor receptor 1, and H3F3A genes in syndromic and nonsyndromic PPGLs. These 4 
new genes were selected because although their association with PPGLs is very 
recent, mounting evidence was generated that rapidly consolidated the prominence 
of these genes in the molecular pathogenesis of PPGLs.
