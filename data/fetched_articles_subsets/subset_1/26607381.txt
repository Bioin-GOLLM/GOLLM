Multipotent and pluripotent stem cells are potential sources for cell and tissue 
replacement therapies. For example, stem cell-derived red blood cells (RBCs) are 
a potential alternative to donated blood, but yield and quality remain a 
challenge. Here, we show that application of insight from human population 
genetic studies can enhance RBC production from stem cells. The SH2B3 gene 
encodes a negative regulator of cytokine signaling and naturally occurring 
loss-of-function variants in this gene increase RBC counts in vivo. Targeted 
suppression of SH2B3 in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 
enhanced the maturation and overall yield of in-vitro-derived RBCs. Moreover, 
inactivation of SH2B3 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in human pluripotent stem 
cells allowed enhanced erythroid cell expansion with preserved differentiation. 
Our findings therefore highlight the potential for combining human genome 
variation studies with genome editing approaches to improve cell and tissue 
production for regenerative medicine.
