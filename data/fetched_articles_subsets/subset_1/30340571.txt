BACKGROUND: Reconstructive joint surgery is an indicator of poor prognosis in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Objectives of this study were to describe the 
incidence rate of orthopedic and hand surgery indication (OHSI) in an ongoing 
cohort of Hispanic early RA patients treated according to a T2T strategy and to 
investigate predictors.
METHODS: Through February 2018, the cohort comprised 185 patients recruited from 
2004 onwards, with variable follow-up, and rheumatic assessments at fixed 
intervals that included prospective determination of OHSI. Charts were reviewed 
by a single data abstractor. OHSI incidence rate was calculated. A case-control 
study nested within a cohort investigated the predictors; cases (OHSI patients) 
were paired with controls (1:4) according to age, sex and autoantibodies. A 
logistic regression model included baseline and cumulative (up to OHSI or 
equivalent) variables related to disease activity, treatment and to persistence 
with therapy. The IRB approved the study.
RESULTS: Patients from the cohort were predominantly middle-aged (mean ± SD age: 
38.5 ± 12.9 years) females (87.6%) with 5.4 ± 2.6 months of disease duration. 
The cohort contributed to 1538 patient-years of follow-up. Twelve patients 
received incidental OHSI at a follow-up of 85 ± 44.5 months. The OHSI incident 
global rate was 8/1000 patient-years. Longer symptom duration at cohort referral 
(OR: 1.313, 95%CI: 1.02-1.68, p = 0.032) and a higher number of flares/patient 
(OR: 1.608, 95%CI: 1.05-1.61, p = 0.015) predicted OHSI. OHSI patients had more 
severe flares than their counterparts, and the opposite figure was true for mild 
flares.
CONCLUSION: Early referral for appropriate management and flare control may 
prevent OHSI in Hispanic recent-onset RA patients.
