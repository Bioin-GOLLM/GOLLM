BACKGROUND: Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) deficiency has recently been 
described as a rare cause of recurrent ketosis, the result of impaired ketone 
utilization in extrahepatic tissues. To date, only six patients with this 
condition have been identified, and clinical and biochemical details remain 
incomplete.
RESULTS: The present work reports a patient suffering from severe, recurrent 
episodes of metabolic acidosis and psychomotor delay, showing a pathogenic 
loss-of-function variation c.747_750del in homozygosity in SLC16A1 (which codes 
for MCT1). Persistent ketotic and lactic acidosis was accompanied by an abnormal 
excretion of organic acids related to redox balance disturbances. Together with 
an altered bioenergetic profile detected in patient-derived fibroblasts, this 
suggests possible mitochondrial dysfunction. Brain MRI revealed extensive, 
diffuse bilateral, symmetric signal alterations for the subcortical white matter 
and basal ganglia, together with corpus callosum agenesia.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the clinical spectrum of MCT1 
deficiency not only involves recurrent atacks of ketoacidosis, but may also 
cause lactic acidosis and neuromotor delay with a distinctive neuroimaging 
pattern including agenesis of corpus callosum and other brain signal 
alterations.
