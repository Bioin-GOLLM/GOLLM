BACKGROUND: Smoking, cardiovascular risk factors, and genetic factors can have 
adverse effects in MS.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if smoking after disease onset, cardiovascular risk 
factors, and genetic variants influence primary progressive MS (PPMS).
METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, smoking habits, Framingham Risk Score 
(FRS), genetic variants, including the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 2 (LRP2) SNP rs12988804 and MRI were collected in 60 PPMS trial 
participants. Disability and cognition were assessed with the Age-Related 
Multiple Sclerosis Severity (ARMSS) score, the Progressive-Onset MS Multiple 
Sclerosis Severity Score, and the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for 
MS.
RESULTS: Smoking after PPMS onset was significantly associated with higher ARMSS 
(95% CI 0.8-2.4, p = 0.00016) statistically significant after Bonferroni 
correction. Lower magnetization transfer ratio in lesions was also significantly 
associated with smoking after onset of PPMS after correction (95% CI -0.9--4.4, 
p = 0.0035). Pack-years in people who smoked after onset was likewise 
significantly associated with higher ARMSS score (b = 0.06 95% CI 0.02-0.09, 
p = 0.0021) as well as lower Symbol Digit Modalities Test scores (b = -0.40; 95% 
CI -0.66--0.13, p = 0.0037), both statistically significant after Bonferroni 
correction. The LRP2 risk allele was associated with decreased performance on 
the California Verbal Learning Test 2 after correction (CC vs. CT+TT 95% CI 
-14.2--3.4, p = 0.0018).
CONCLUSION: If validated, these findings suggest that intervention regarding 
smoking may be beneficial in PPMS. If confirmed, assessment of the LRP2 gene 
variant may aid in the understanding of underlying pathological mechanisms in 
PPMS.
