Despite the growing number of preclinical and clinical trials focused on 
immunotherapy for the treatment of malignant gliomas, the prognosis for this 
disease remains grim. Cancer immunotherapy seeks to recruit an effective immune 
response to eliminate tumor cells. To date, cancer vaccines have shown only 
limited effectiveness because of our incomplete understanding of the necessary 
effector cells and mechanisms that yield efficient tumor clearance. CD8+ T cell 
cytotoxic activity has long been proposed as the primary effector function 
necessary for tumor regression. However, there is increasing evidence that 
indicates that components of the immune system other than CD8+ T cells play 
important roles in tumor eradication and control. The following review should 
provide an understanding of the mechanisms involved in an effective antitumor 
response to guide future therapeutic designs. The information provided suggests 
an alternate means of effective tumor clearance in malignant glioma to the 
canonical CD8+ cytotoxic T cell mechanism.
