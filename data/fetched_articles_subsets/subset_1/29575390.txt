Discovery of a high-risk group for pancreatic cancer is important for prevention 
of pancreatic cancer. The present study was conducted as a nested case-control 
study including 170 pancreatic cancer cases and 340 matched controls of our 
population-based cohort study involving 30 239 subjects who answered a baseline 
questionnaire and supplied blood samples. Twelve targeted metabolites were 
quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Odds 
ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 
calculated using conditional logistic regression models. Statistically 
significant P-value was defined as P < .05. Increasing 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol 
(1,5-AG) levels were associated with a decreasing trend in pancreatic cancer 
risk (OR of quartile 4 [Q4], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27-0.93; P = .02). Increasing 
methionine levels were also associated with an increasing trend of pancreatic 
cancer risk (OR of Q4, 1.79; 95% CI, 0.94-3.40: P = .03). Additional adjustment 
for potential confounders attenuated the observed associations of 1,5-AG and 
methionine (P for trend = .06 and .07, respectively). Comparing subjects 
diagnosed in the first 0-6 years, higher levels of 1,5-AG, asparagine, tyrosine 
and uric acid showed a decreasing trend for pancreatic cancer risk (P for trend 
= .04, .04, .04 and .02, respectively), even after adjustment for potential 
confounders. We found that the 12 target metabolites were not associated with 
pancreatic cancer risk. However, metabolic changes in the subjects diagnosed in 
the first 0-6 years showed a similar tendency to our previous reports. These 
results might suggest that these metabolites are useful for early detection but 
not for prediction of pancreatic cancer.
