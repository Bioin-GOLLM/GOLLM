Transcription factors (TFs) operate by the combined activity of their 
DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and effector domains (EDs) enabling the coordination 
of gene expression on a genomic scale. Here we show that in vivo delivery of an 
engineered DNA-binding protein uncoupled from the repressor domain can produce 
efficient and gene-specific transcriptional silencing. To interfere with 
RHODOPSIN (RHO) gain-of-function mutations we engineered the ZF6-DNA-binding 
protein (ZF6-DB) that targets 20 base pairs (bp) of a RHOcis-regulatory element 
(CRE) and demonstrate Rho specific transcriptional silencing upon 
adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated expression in photoreceptors. The 
data show that the 20 bp-long genomic DNA sequence is necessary for RHO 
expression and that photoreceptor delivery of the corresponding cognate 
synthetic trans-acting factor ZF6-DB without the intrinsic transcriptional 
repression properties of the canonical ED blocks Rho expression with negligible 
genome-wide transcript perturbations. The data support DNA-binding-mediated 
silencing as a novel mode to treat gain-of-function mutations.
