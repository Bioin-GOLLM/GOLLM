Inguinal hernia is a common surgical disease, for which genetic factors have 
been suggested to play a role. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a highly conserved 
NAD-dependent class III deacetylase, has been implicated in human diseases. 
Since SIRT1 regulates differentiation and proliferation of human skeletal 
muscles and fibroblasts, we speculated that misregulation of SIRT1 gene, caused 
by DNA sequence variants (DSVs) within its regulatory regions, may contribute to 
inguinal hernia development. In this study, SIRT1 gene promoter was genetically 
and functionally analyzed in patients with indirect inguinal hernia (IIH) 
(n=139) and ethnic-matched healthy controls (n=148). Two heterozygous DSVs, 
g.69644213G>A and g.69644268T>A, and one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 
g.69643707A>C (rs35706870), were found in IIH patients, but not in controls. Two 
closely-linked SNPs, g.69644217A>C (rs932658) and g.69644341G>C (rs2394443), 
were found in IIH patients with significantly higher frequency, compared to 
controls (P=0.006). The C alleles of the SNPs g.69644217A>C (rs932658) and 
g.69644341G>C (rs2394443) were associated with IIH (P=0.028, OR 1.600, 95%CI 
1.049-2.439). These DSVs significantly altered the transcriptional activities of 
the SIRT1 gene promoter in cultured cells. Therefore, our data suggested that 
these DSVs may alter the transcriptional activities of SIRT1 gene promoter and 
change SIRT1 levels, contributing to IIH development as risk factors.
