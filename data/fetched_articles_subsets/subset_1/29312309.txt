Leishmaniasis is a neglected protozoan disease that mainly affects the tropical 
as well as subtropical countries of the world. The primary option to control the 
disease still relies on chemotherapy. However, a hindrance to treatments owing 
to the emergence of drug-resistant parasites, enormous side effects of the 
drugs, their high cost, and requirement of long course hospitalization has added 
to the existing problems of leishmaniasis containment program. This review 
highlights the prospects of immunotherapy and/or immunochemotherapy to address 
the limitations for current treatment measures for leishmaniasis. In addition to 
the progress in alternate therapeutic strategies, the possibility and advances 
in developing preventive measures against the disease have been pointed. The 
review highlights our recent understandings of the protective immunology that 
can be exploited to develop an effective vaccine against leishmaniasis. 
Moreover, an update on the approaches that have evolved over the recent years 
are predominantly focused to overcome the current challenges in developing 
immunotherapeutic as well as prophylactic antileishmanial vaccines is discussed.
