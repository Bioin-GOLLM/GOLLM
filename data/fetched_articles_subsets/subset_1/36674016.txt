Peripheral refraction can lead to the development of myopia. The aim of this 
study was to compare relative peripheral refraction (RPR) in the same cohort of 
uncorrected (WCL) and corrected eyes with two different soft contact lenses (CL) 
designed for myopia control, and to analyze RPR depending on the patient’s 
refraction. A total of 228 myopic eyes (114 healthy adult subjects) (−0.25 D to 
−10.00 D) were included. Open-field autorefraction was used to measure on- and 
off- axis refractions when uncorrected and corrected with the two CLs (dual 
focus (DF) and extended depth of focus (EDOF)). The RPR was measured every 10° 
out to 30° in a temporal-nasal orientation and analyzed as a component of the 
power vector (M). The average RPR for all subjects was hyperopic when WCL and 
when corrected with EDOF CL design, but changed to a myopic RPR when corrected 
with DF design. Significant differences were found between RPR curves with both 
CLs in all the eccentricities (Bonferroni correction p < 0.008, except 10°N). An 
incremental relationship between relative peripheral refraction at 30 degrees 
and myopia level was found. It is concluded that the two CLs work differently at 
the periphery in order to achieve myopia control.
