Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such 
as gefitinib, have been established as first-line treatments for non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and have exhibited notable clinical efficacy. 
However, resistance to TKIs has become one of the major obstacles in improving 
the therapeutic efficacy of patients with NSCLC. This study aims to investigate 
the role of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC01116 in gefitinib resistance 
of NSCLC and explore its underlying mechanism. In this study, we found that 
LINC01116 is upregulated in the gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells and tissues. 
Loss- and gain-of-function assays uncovered that LINC01116 downregulation 
sensitized gefitinib resistance, whereas the overexpression of LINC01116 
conferred PC9/R cells to gefitinib resistance. Moreover, LINC01116 silencing 
increased IFI44 expression. Overexpression of IFI44 reversed the resistance to 
gefitinib in PC9/R cells, and rescue experiments confirmed that LINC01116 
affects the gefitinib resistance of PC9/R cells partly dependent on regulating 
IFI44 expression. Moreover, downregulation of LINC01116 increased the 
sensitivity of PC9/R cells to gefitinib in vivo. Our study demonstrates that 
LINC01116 plays a critical role in gefitinib resistance of NSCLC cells by 
affecting IFI44 expression, providing a novel therapeutic target to overcome TKI 
resistance in NSCLC.
