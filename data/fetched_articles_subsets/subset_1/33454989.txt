The endocrine and the immune systems interact by sharing receptors for hormones 
and cytokines, cross-control and feedback mechanisms. To date, no comprehensive 
study has assessed the impact of thyroid hormones on immune homeostasis. By 
studying immune phenotype (cell populations, antibody concentrations, 
circulating cytokines, adipokines and acute-phase proteins, monocyte-platelet 
interactions and cytokine production capacity) in two large independent cohorts 
of healthy volunteers of Western European descent from the Human Functional 
Genomics Project (500FG and 300BCG cohorts), we identified a crucial role of the 
thyroid hormone thyroxin (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) on the 
homeostasis of lymphocyte populations. TSH concentrations were strongly 
associated with multiple populations of both effector and regulatory T cells, 
whereas B-cell populations were significantly associated with free T4 (fT4). In 
contrast, fT4 and TSH had little impact on myeloid cell populations and cytokine 
production capacity. Mendelian randomization further supported the role of fT4 
for lymphocyte homeostasis. Subsequently, using a genomics approach, we 
identified genetic variants that influence both fT4 and TSH concentrations and 
immune responses, and gene set enrichment pathway analysis showed enrichment of 
fT4-affected gene expression in B-cell function pathways, including the CD40 
pathway, further supporting the importance of fT4 in the regulation of B-cell 
function. In conclusion, we show that thyroid function controls the homeostasis 
of the lymphoid cell compartment. These findings improve our understanding of 
the immune responses and open the door for exploring and understanding the role 
of thyroid hormones in the lymphocyte function during disease.
