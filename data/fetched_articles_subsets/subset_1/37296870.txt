The metastatic suppressor BRMS1 interacts with critical steps of the metastatic 
cascade in many cancer entities. As gliomas rarely metastasize, BRMS1 has mainly 
been neglected in glioma research. However, its interaction partners, such as 
NFκB, VEGF, or MMPs, are old acquaintances in neurooncology. The steps regulated 
by BRMS1, such as invasion, migration, and apoptosis, are commonly dysregulated 
in gliomas. Therefore, BRMS1 shows potential as a regulator of glioma behavior. 
By bioinformatic analysis, in addition to our cohort of 118 specimens, we 
determined BRMS1 mRNA and protein expression as well as its correlation with the 
clinical course in astrocytomas IDH mutant, CNS WHO grade 2/3, and glioblastoma 
IDH wild-type, CNS WHO grade 4. Interestingly, we found BRMS1 protein expression 
to be significantly decreased in the aforementioned gliomas, while BRMS1 mRNA 
appeared to be overexpressed throughout. This dysregulation was independent of 
patients' characteristics or survival. The protein and mRNA expression 
differences cannot be finally explained at this stage. However, they suggest a 
post-transcriptional dysregulation that has been previously described in other 
cancer entities. Our analyses present the first data on BRMS1 expression in 
gliomas that can provide a starting point for further investigations.
