OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of G487A polymorphism of aldehyde 
dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) gene with hypertension in patients with coronary heart 
disease complicated by type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: This study was conducted among 167 patients with coronary heart disease 
complicated by diabetes mellitus. The polymorphisms of gene G487A ALDH2 were 
determined using polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragments length 
polymorphism technique (PCR-RFLP). According to the genotypes, the patients were 
divided into GG group (n=105) and GA/AA group (n=62), and the incidence of 
hypertension, risk factors of hypertension, systolic and diastolic pressures, 
and pulse pressure indexes were compared between the two groups. Multivariate 
logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust the effects of the 
confounding factors.
RESULTS: The incidence of hypertension in GA/AA group was significantly higher 
than that in GG group (P<0.05), and the former group showed a significantly 
greater differences between systolic and pulse pressure; the diastolic pressure 
was comparable between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
showed that GA/AA was associated with an increased risk of hypertension in 
synergy with high insulin level and insulin resistance.
CONCLUSION: ALDH2 gene G487A polymorphism may be associated with hypertension in 
patients with coronary heart disease complicated by type 2 diabetes, and the 
patients with an A allele have a greater risk of developing hypertension.
