OBJECTIVE: Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder with genetic 
predisposition. There is strong evidence that members of the selectin family 
participate in the interaction between leucocytes and the endothelium, as well 
as in inflammatory cell recruitment. Moreover, a high serum level of a soluble 
form of L-selectin (SL-selectin) has been reported in untreated GD patients. 
However, the impact of L-selectin polymorphisms on GD has not yet been 
investigated. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether L-selectin 
gene polymorphisms were associated with the development of GD.
SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: L-selectin gene polymorphisms were investigated in 230 
Chinese GD patients and 208 healthy control subjects without antithyroid 
autoantibodies or a family history of autoimmune disorders. Two L-selectin SNPs 
were genotyped by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) 
method.
RESULTS: A C/T polymorphism at position -642 of the promoter region and a 
Pro213Ser (c.725 C-T) polymorphism in exon 6 were examined using PCR-RFLP. There 
was a significant increase in -642T allele frequency in GD patients compared 
with healthy controls (70 vs. 62%; P = 0.0126; P(c) = 0.0252). The frequency of 
the c.725C allele in exon 6 also appeared higher in GD patients than in 
controls. Haplotype analysis showed a significant decrease in the -642C/c.725T 
haplotype in GD patients (26 vs. 34%; P = 0.0095; Pc = 0.0190). However there 
was no association between polymorphisms and certain GD clinical phenotypes, 
including age of onset and ophthalmopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: L-selectin gene polymorphisms are associated with GD susceptibility 
in Chinese patients.
