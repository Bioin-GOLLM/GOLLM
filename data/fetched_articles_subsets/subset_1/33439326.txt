Various candidate genes have been reported to affect milk yield and composition 
in dairy cattle. A non-synonymous mutation in the DGAT1 gene, i.e., K232A was 
reported to have a strong association with milk yield and milk composition of 
Bos taurus. A study has been undertaken on 502 unrelated individuals belonging 
to indigenous Ongole cattle, crossbred cattle, and Murrah buffaloes from the 
Indian sub-continent with the objective to determine the polymorphism of the 
K232A locus and their association with milk yield and composition. Typing DGAT1 
K232A allelic variation by PCR-RFLP using CfrI restriction enzyme revealed three 
genotypes in crossbred cattle. Genotype KK was more prevalent (0.60) in Jersey 
crossbred, whereas in Holstein Friesian crossbred it was KA genotype (0.48). In 
Ongole cattle and Murrah buffaloes, the locus did not exhibit polymorphism. The 
least-square mean of milk yields pooled over lactations across the DGAT1 
variants was significantly (P < 0.05) higher among the homozygous (AA) 
genotypes, both in Jersey crossbred and HF crossbred cattle after adjusting for 
the effects of farm, parity, and season. The fat, SNF, and protein content 
values of AA genotypes were less than the KK genotypes in both the genetic 
groups (P > 0.05). The fixation of the DGAT1K allele at the locus in Bos indicus 
cattle and Bubalus bubalis in the present study did not support its use as a 
reliable universal marker for milk production and composition traits.
