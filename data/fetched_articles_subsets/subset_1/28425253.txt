BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aimed to explore the associations of the 
﻿﻿cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene TaqIB and D442G polymorphisms 
with essential hypertension (EH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, 883 hypertensive patients and 
1044 normal controls were randomly selected from the Mongolian population of 
China. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing of PCR products 
were used to identify the genotypes. Haplotype analysis was performed by 
estimating the haplotype frequencies using the online SHEsis package.
RESULTS: The distribution frequency of the B2-G haplotype was significantly 
lower in the EH group than in the control group (0.7% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.001, OR = 
0.359 [0.188-0.689]). Subjects with the B2B2 genotype showed significantly lower 
levels of total cholesterol (TC) (P < 0.05). When subgrouped by sex, male 
subjects with the B2B2 genotype showed significantly increased high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased TC levels (P < 0.05), and those with the 
B2 allele showed significantly lower triglyceride levels as compared to the 
subjects with the B1B1 homozygote (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: TaqIB and D442G polymorphisms of the CETP gene did not independently 
affect the risk of developing EH in the Chinese Mongolian population, while the 
B2-G haplotype obviously decreased the susceptibility to EH. The B2 allele could 
alter the blood lipid level and reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular 
diseases.
