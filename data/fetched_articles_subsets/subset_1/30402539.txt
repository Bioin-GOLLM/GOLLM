Intracellular delivery of mRNA, DNA, and other large macromolecules into cells 
plays an essential role in an array of biological research and clinical 
therapies. However, current methods yield a wide variation in the amount of 
material delivered, as well as limitations on the cell types and cargoes 
possible. Here, we demonstrate quantitatively controlled delivery into a range 
of primary cells and cell lines with a tight dosage distribution using a 
nanostraw-electroporation system (NES). In NES, cells are cultured onto 
track-etched membranes with protruding nanostraws that connect to the fluidic 
environment beneath the membrane. The tight cell-nanostraw interface focuses 
applied electric fields to the cell membrane, enabling low-voltage and 
nondamaging local poration of the cell membrane. Concurrently, the field 
electrophoretically injects biomolecular cargoes through the nanostraws and into 
the cell at the same location. We show that the amount of material delivered is 
precisely controlled by the applied voltage, delivery duration, and reagent 
concentration. NES is highly effective even for primary cell types or different 
cell densities, is largely cargo agnostic, and can simultaneously deliver 
specific ratios of different molecules. Using a simple cell culture well format, 
the NES delivers into >100,000 cells within 20 s with >95% cell viability, 
enabling facile, dosage-controlled intracellular delivery for a wide variety of 
biological applications.
