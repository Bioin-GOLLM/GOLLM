Alternative transcriptional initiation (ATI) refers to the frequent observation 
that one gene has multiple transcription start sites (TSSs). Although this 
phenomenon is thought to be adaptive, the specific advantage is rarely known. 
Here, we propose that each gene has one optimal TSS and that ATI arises 
primarily from imprecise transcriptional initiation that could be deleterious. 
This error hypothesis predicts that (i) the TSS diversity of a gene reduces with 
its expression level; (ii) the fractional use of the major TSS increases, but 
that of each minor TSS decreases, with the gene expression level; and (iii) 
cis-elements for major TSSs are selectively constrained, while those for minor 
TSSs are not. By contrast, the adaptive hypothesis does not make these 
predictions a priori. Our analysis of human and mouse transcriptomes confirms 
each of the three predictions. These and other findings strongly suggest that 
ATI predominantly results from molecular errors, requiring a major revision of 
our understanding of the precision and regulation of transcription.
