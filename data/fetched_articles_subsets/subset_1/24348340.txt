The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an ideal organism for studying neural 
plasticity and animal behaviors. A total of 302 neurons of a C. elegans 
hermaphrodite have been classified into 118 neuronal groups. This simple neural 
circuit provides a solid basis for understanding the mechanisms of the brains of 
higher animals, including humans. Recent studies that employ modern imaging and 
manipulation techniques enable researchers to study the dynamic properties of 
nervous systems with great precision. Behavioral and molecular genetic analyses 
of this tiny animal have contributed greatly to the advancement of neural 
circuit research. Here, we will review the recent studies on the neural circuits 
of C. elegans that have been conducted in Japan. Several laboratories have 
established unique and clever methods to study the underlying neuronal 
substrates of behavioral regulation in C. elegans. The technological advances 
applied to studies of C. elegans have allowed new approaches for the studies of 
complex neural systems. Through reviewing the studies on the neuronal circuits 
of C. elegans in Japan, we will analyze and discuss the directions of neural 
circuit studies.
