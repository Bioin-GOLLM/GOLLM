G-quadruplexes in oncogene promoters provide putative targets for 
transcriptional regulation. The structure of a putative G-quadruplex sequence 
(S1: GGAGAAGGAGGAGGTGGAGGAGGAGGG) in potassium solution in the her2 promoter has 
been resolved mainly through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. By 
application of various NMR spectra, we proved the formation of a four-layer 
G-quadruplex composing of two G-tetrads and two G/A-mixed planes with a 
four-residues loop (A3-G4-A5-A6). Further evidence from a luciferase reporter 
assay, Q-RT-PCR and Western blotting indicates that S1 G-quadruplex formation 
can repress her2 promoter activity, and a selected G-quadruplex ligand cÎ² can 
enhance the repression by down regulating her2 transcription and expression. 
These findings provide a G-quadruplex target and perspective implications in 
her2 transcriptional regulation.
