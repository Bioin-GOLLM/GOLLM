BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: A combination of resistant and susceptible 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolated from clinical specimens is referred to 
as heteroresistance. Heteroresistance leads to difficulties in drug resistance 
testing and may adversely affect treatment outcomes. The present study estimated 
the proportion of heteroresistance among MTB in clinical samples of presumptive 
drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) patients in Central India.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of data generated from line probe assay (LPA) 
at a tertiary care hospital in Central India between January 2013 and December 
2018 was carried out. A heteroresistant MTB in a sample was indicated by the 
presence of both wild-type and mutant-type patterns on an LPA strip.
RESULTS: Data analysis was carried out on interpretable 11,788 LPA results. 
Heteroresistance in MTB was detected in 637 (5.4%) samples. Of these, 
heteroresistance in MTB was detected in 413 (64.8%), 163 (25.5%) and 61 (9.5%) 
samples with respect to rpoB, katG and inhA genes, respectively.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Heteroresistance is considered a preliminary step 
in the development of drug resistance. Delayed or suboptimal anti-tubercular 
therapy in patients with heteroresistance of MTB may elicit full clinical 
resistance and negatively impact the National TB Elimination Programme. Further 
studies are, however, needed to determine the impact of heteroresistance on 
treatment outcomes in individual patients.
