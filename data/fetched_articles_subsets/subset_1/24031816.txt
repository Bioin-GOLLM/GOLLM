The present study reports statistical medial optimization for chitinase 
production by a novel bacterial strain isolated from soil recently, which the 
name Chitinolyticbacter meiyuanensis SYBC-H1 is proposed. A sequential 
statistical methodology comprising of Plackett-Burman and response surface 
methodology (RSM) was applied to enhance the fermentative production of 
chitinase, in which inulin was firstly used as an effective carbon source. As a 
result, maximum chitinase activity of 5.17 U/mL was obtained in the optimized 
medium, which was 15.5-fold higher than that in the basal medium. The triplicate 
verification experiments were performed under the optimized nutrients levels 
which indicated that it well agreed with the predicted value.
