Plant cells are encapsulated by cell walls whose properties largely determine 
cell growth. We have previously identified the rol1-2 mutant, which shows 
defects in seedling root and shoot development. rol1-2 is affected in the 
Rhamnose synthase 1 (RHM1) and shows alterations in the structures of 
Rhamnogalacturonan I (RG I) and RG II, two rhamnose-containing pectins. The data 
presented here shows that root tissue of the rol1-2 mutant fails to properly 
differentiate the cell wall in cell corners and accumulates excessive amounts of 
callose, both of which likely alter the physical properties of cells. A surr 
(suppressor of the rol1-2 root developmental defect) mutant was identified that 
alleviates the cell growth defects in rol1-2. The cell wall differentiation 
defect is re-established in the rol1-2 surr mutant and callose accumulation is 
reduced compared to rol1-2. The surr mutation is an allele of the 
cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), which encodes a component of the mediator 
complex that influences processes central to plant growth and development. 
Together, the identification of the surr mutant suggests that changes in cell 
wall composition and turnover in the rol1-2 mutant have a significant impact on 
cell growth and reveals a function of CDK8 in cell wall architecture and 
composition.
