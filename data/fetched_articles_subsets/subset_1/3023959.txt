Introduction of UAG, UAA, and UGA nonsense mutations at a specific site in the 
Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene: use in measurement of 
amber, ochre, and opal suppression in mammalian cells.

We have used oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis to convert 
serine codon 27 of the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) 
gene to UAG, UAA, and UGA nonsense codons. The mutant cat genes, under 
transcriptional control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat, were 
then introduced into mammalian cells by DNA transfection along with UAG, UAA, 
and UGA suppressor tRNA genes derived from a human serine tRNA. Assay for CAT 
enzymatic activity in extracts from such cells allowed us to detect and 
quantitate nonsense suppression in monkey CV-1 cells and mouse NIH3T3 cells. 
Using such an assay, we provide the first direct evidence that an opal 
suppressor tRNA gene is functional in mammalian cells. The pattern of 
suppression of the three cat nonsense mutations in bacteria suggests that the 
serine at position 27 of CAT can be replaced by a wide variety of amino acids 
without loss of enzymatic activity. Thus, these mutant cat genes should be 
generally useful for the quantitation of suppressor activity of suppressor tRNA 
genes introduced into cells and possibly for the detection of naturally 
occurring nonsense suppressors.
