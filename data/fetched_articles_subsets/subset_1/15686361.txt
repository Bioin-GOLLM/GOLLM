A high-valent iron-oxo species analogous to the compound I of peroxidases has 
been thought to be the activated oxygen species in P450-catalyzed reactions. 
Spectroscopic characterization of the catalytically competent iron-oxo species 
in iodosobenzene (PhIO)-supported model reactions and parallels between these 
model reactions and PhIO- and NADPH/O2-supported P450 reactions have been taken 
as strong evidence for this proposal. To support this proposal, subtle 
differences observed in regio- and chemoselectivities, isotope effects, and 
source of oxygen, etc., between NADPH/O2- and PhIO-supported P450 reactions have 
been generally attributed to reasons other than the mechanistic differences 
between the two systems. In the present study, we have used a series of 
sensitive mechanistic probes, 4-chloro-N-cyclopropyl-N-alkylanilines, to compare 
and contrast the chemistries of the NADPH/O2- and PhIO-supported purified CYP2B1 
N-dealkylation reactions. Herein we present the first experimental evidence to 
demonstrate that the NADPH/O2- and PhIO-supported P450 N-dealkylations are 
mechanistically distinct and, thus, the P450/PhIO system may not be a good 
mechanistic model for P450/NADPH/O2-catalyzed N-dealkylations.
