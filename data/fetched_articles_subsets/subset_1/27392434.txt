BACKGROUND: Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10 (PTEN) loss 
of function is frequently detected in advanced colorectal cancer. Its detection 
is thought to have prognostic significance and it is being considered to predict 
responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapy. Unfortunately, while immunohistochemical 
assessment of PTEN expression is widespread, it lacks standardization and the 
results are hardly comparable across the available publications.
METHODS: Retrospectively collected, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded 
colorectal tumor tissue samples from 55 patients were combined into tissue 
microarray (TMA) blocks. We used three different PTEN antibodies to determine 
the frequency, intensity and intracellular pattern of PTEN immunohistochemical 
labeling: Neomarkers, Dako and CellSignaling. We evaluated the aforementioned 
parameters in selected regions of colorectal cancers and in their lymph node 
metastases by using three scoring methods that take into consideration both 
staining frequency and intensity (H1-H3-score). We also evaluated intracellular 
localization.
RESULTS: The Dako and CellSignaling antibodies stained predominantly cytoplasms, 
while the Neomarkers antibody specifically stained cell nuclei. PTEN H-scores 
were significantly lower in all tumor areas as compared to the normal colonic 
mucosa based on staining with the DAKO and CellSignaling antibodies. 
Intratumoral regional differences or differences between matching tumors and 
metastases were not detected with any of the antibodies. Neither Dako, neither 
CellSignaling, nor the Neomarkers antibodies revealed a significant correlation 
between PTEN expression and pT, Dukes/MAC and clinical stage. KRAS status, 
histological grade correlated with PTEN H-scores based on staining with the 
Neomarkers antibody. PTEN H-scores did not correlate with MMR status. PTEN 
H-scores did not show any correlation with relapse-free survival based on 
staining with either antibody.
CONCLUSIONS: While PTEN expression decreased in colorectal cancer according to 
two antibodies, neither of the three applied PTEN antibodies could justify 
significant correlation with clinicopathological data, nor had prognostic value. 
Thus, we might conclude that immunohistochemical PTEN investigation remains a 
challenge requiring more standardized evaluation on larger number of cases to 
clarify its utility as a prognostic and predictive tool in CRC. The 
standardization of immunohistochemical method is key in the evaluation process, 
which is further discussed.
