OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate whether beta-2 adrenoceptor (β2AR) genotype at 
a functional polymorphic site encoding for amino acid residue 16 influences rate 
of cervical dilatation in term and late preterm active labor.
STUDY DESIGN: Subjects who underwent vaginal delivery at ≥34 weeks' gestational 
age from May 2006 through August 2007 were identified. Each subject had provided 
venous blood from which DNA was extracted for β2AR genotyping. Digital cervical 
examinations with paired examination times were collected from intrapartum 
records. Rate of cervical dilatation in active labor was determined using linear 
regression. Rates were compared between genotype groups.
RESULTS: Among 401 subjects with satisfactory genotype and intrapartum data, 
overall rate of active labor was 0.76±0.01 cm/h. When labor was compared by 
genotype, homozygous Arg/Arg16 subjects progressed at a slower rate (0.64±0.03 
cm/h) than all other pooled genotypes (0.8±0.02 cm/h, P<.001).
CONCLUSION: Homozygous β2AR genotype encoding for Arg/Arg16 was associated with 
slower progress in active labor.
