OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of polymorphisms in nucleotide excision 
repair (NER) and homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways on the 
development of osteosarcoma patients.
METHODS: Genotypes of ERCC1 rs11615 and rs3212986, ERCC2 rs1799793 and rs13181, 
NBN rs709816 and rs1805794, RAD51 rs1801320, rs1801321 and rs12593359, and XRCC3 
rs861539 were conducted by Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length 
Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay.
RESULTS: Total 148 osteosarcoma patients and 296 control subjects were collected 
from Taizhou First People's Hospital. Conditional logistic regression analyses 
found that individuals carrying with GA+AA genotype of ERCC2 rs1799793 and GC+CC 
genotype of NBN rs1805794 were significantly associated with increased risk of 
osteosarcoma, and the ORs(95%CI) were 1.58(1.03-2.41) and 2.66(1.73-4.08), 
respectively. We found that GA+AA genotype of ERCC2 rs1799793 or GC+CC genotype 
of NBN rs1805794 were associated with an increased risk of osteosarcoma in 
females, with ORs(95%CI) of 2.42(1.20-4.87) and 2.01(1.07-4.23), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ERCC2 rs1799793 and NBN rs1805794 
polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk for osteosarcoma, which 
suggests that NER and HRR pathways modulate the risk of developing osteosarcoma.
