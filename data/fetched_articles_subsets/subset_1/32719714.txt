BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare and severe X-linked 
muscular dystrophy in which the standard of care with variable outcome, also due 
to different drug response, is chronic off-label treatment with corticosteroids 
(CS). In order to search for SNP biomarkers for corticosteroid responsiveness, 
we genotyped variants across 205 DMD-related genes in patients with differential 
response to steroid treatment.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled a total of 228 DMD patients with identified 
dystrophin mutations, 78 of these patients have been under corticosteroid 
treatment for at least 5 years. DMD patients were defined as high responders 
(HR) if they had maintained the ability to walk after 15 years of age and low 
responders (LR) for those who had lost ambulation before the age of 10 despite 
corticosteroid therapy. Based on interactome mapping, we prioritized 205 genes 
and sequenced them in 21 DMD patients (discovery cohort or DiC = 21). We 
identified 43 SNPs that discriminate between HR and LR. Discriminant Analysis of 
Principal Components (DAPC) prioritized 2 response-associated SNPs in the 
TNFRSF10A gene. Validation of this genotype was done in two additional larger 
cohorts composed of 46 DMD patients on corticosteroid therapy (validation 
cohorts or VaC1), and 150 non ambulant DMD patients and never treated with 
corticosteroids (VaC2). SNP analysis in all validation cohorts (N = 207) showed 
that the CT haplotype is significantly associated with HR DMDs confirming the 
discovery results.
CONCLUSION: We have shown that TNFRSF10A CT haplotype correlates with 
corticosteroid response in DMD patients and propose it as an exploratory CS 
response biomarker.
