Hemoglobin is the natural carrier of oxygen in red blood cells (RBCs). While 
intracellular hemoglobin provides life-sustaining oxygen transport, 
extracellular free hemoglobin displays toxicity due to inherent peroxidase 
activity generating reactive oxygen species that subsequently react with the 
hemoglobin molecule to produce toxic heme degradation products resulting in free 
radicals, oxidative stress damage, and lipid peroxidation. We have recently 
demonstrated that Peptide Inhibitor of Complement C1 (PIC1) inhibits peroxidase 
activity of the heme-based enzyme myeloperoxidase. To elucidate whether PIC1 
could inhibit peroxidase activity of hemoglobin, we evaluated the consequence of 
PIC1 on RBC lysates, methemoglobin, and myoglobin using tetramethylbenzidine 
(TMB) as an oxidation target. PIC1 reversibly and dose-dependently prevented TMB 
oxidation to tetramethylbenzidine diimine by RBC lysates, methemoglobin, and 
myoglobin, having comparable activity to the inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic acid 
hydrazide. PIC1 inhibited TMB oxidation of RBC lysates similar to L-cysteine 
suggesting that the two cysteine residues contained in PIC1 may mediate 
peroxidase activity. PIC1 also inhibited heme destruction by NaOCl for RBC 
lysates, hemoglobin, and myoglobin as assayed by preservation of the Soret 
absorbance peak in the presence of NaOCl and reduction in free iron release. In 
conclusion, PIC1 inhibits peroxidase activity of hemoglobin and myoglobin likely 
via an antioxidant mechanism.
