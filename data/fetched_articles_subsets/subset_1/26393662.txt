The molecular mechanisms that lead to the progression of alcoholic liver disease 
have been actively examined for decades. Because the hepatic microtubule 
cytoskeleton supports innumerable cellular processes, it has been the focus of 
many such mechanistic studies. It has long been appreciated that Î±-tubulin is a 
major target for modification by highly reactive ethanol metabolites and 
reactive oxygen species. It is also now apparent that alcohol exposure induces 
post-translational modifications that are part of the natural repertoire, mainly 
acetylation. In this review, the modifications of the "tubulin code" are 
described as well as those adducts by ethanol metabolites. The potential 
cellular consequences of microtubule modification are described with a focus on 
alcohol-induced defects in protein trafficking and enhanced steatosis. Possible 
mechanisms that can explain hepatic dysfunction are described and how this 
relates to the onset of liver injury is discussed. Finally, we propose that 
agents that alter the cellular acetylation state may represent a novel 
therapeutic strategy for treating liver disease.
