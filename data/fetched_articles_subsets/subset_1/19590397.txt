Genes that regulate the serotonin signalling system are potential targets for 
research in the aetiology of mood disorders and also in the treatment response 
of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In this study, we evaluated the association of 
seven serotonin signal transduction-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms 
[HTR1A (rs6295), HTR2A (rs6313, rs6311 and rs7997012), HTR6 (rs1805054), TPH1 
(rs1800532) and TPH2 (rs1386494)] with major depressive disorder and/or 
treatment outcome with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients who met the 
criteria for major depressive disorder were treated for 6 weeks with fluoxetine, 
paroxetine or citalopram. The treatment response was evaluated with the 
Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and according to predefined response 
criteria, the patients were divided into responders, nonresponders, remitters 
and nonremitters. Altogether, 86 patients completed the entire study according 
to the study protocol. We had also a control population (N = 395) of healthy 
blood donors. None of the seven single nucleotide polymorphisms was associated 
with major depressive disorder or with treatment response in our study 
population of Finnish individuals.
