Murine models offer a valuable tool to recapitulate genetically defined subtypes 
of AML, and to assess the potential of compound mutations and clonal evolution 
during disease progression. This is of particular importance for difficult to 
treat leukemias such as FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) positive AML. 
While conditional gene targeting by Cre recombinase is a powerful technology 
that has revolutionized biomedical research, consequences of Cre expression such 
as lack of fidelity, toxicity or off-target effects need to be taken into 
consideration. We report on a transgenic murine model of FLT3-ITD induced 
disease, where Cre recombinase expression alone, and in the absence of a 
conditional allele, gives rise to an aggressive leukemia phenotype. Here, 
expression of various Cre recombinases leads to polyclonal expansion of 
FLT3ITD/ITD progenitor cells, induction of a differentiation block and 
activation of Myc-dependent gene expression programs. Our report is intended to 
alert the scientific community of potential risks associated with using this 
specific mouse model and of unexpected effects of Cre expression when 
investigating cooperative oncogenic mutations in murine models of cancer.
