By balancing the ratios of dopamine and norepinephrine, dopamine beta 
hydroxylase (DBH) plays an important role in brain reward circuit that is 
involved with behavioral effects of heroin addiction. DBH -1021C/T (rs1611115) 
is a functional variant with strong correlation with plasma DBH activity and 
several nerval and psychic disorders. In the present study, we have collected 
333 male cases with heroin addiction and 200 male healthy controls to explore 
the role of -1021C/T in heroin addiction. There is no evidence of association 
between -1021C/T and heroin addiction on both genotype and allele levels 
(P>0.05). In the injection subgroup of cases, -1021TT carriers have longer 
heroin addiction time (P<0.001) and higher dosage of self-administered heroin 
(P=0.045) than carriers with -1021CC or -1021CT, suggesting that patients with 
TT genotype are likely to have more progressive style of heroin users with 
injection route. In conclusion, our results support -1021TT genotype may be 
implicated with a more progressive nature of heroin addiction, although DBH 
-1021C/T is unlikely to be involved in the risk of heroin addiction.
