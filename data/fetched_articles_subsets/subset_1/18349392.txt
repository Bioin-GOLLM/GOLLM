PURPOSE: Regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling 
pathways may play a relevant role in determining the activity of cetuximab 
therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). We investigated 
possible associations between genetic variants and clinical outcomes of MCRC 
patients treated with cetuximab-irinotecan salvage therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent cetuximab-irinotecan salvage 
therapy after disease progression during or after first-line bolus/infusional 
fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin chemotherapy and a second-line 
irinotecan-based regimen were considered eligible for analysis of polymorphisms 
with putative influence on cetuximab-related pathways. Epidermal growth factor 
(EGF) 61A>G, EGF receptor (EGFR) 216G>T, EGFR 497G>A, EGFR intron-1 (CA)(n) 
dinucleotide short (S)/long (L) variant, cyclin-D1 870A>G, immunoglobulin-G 
fragment-C receptors RIIIa 158G>T, and RIIa 131G>A were studied for a possible 
association with overall survival (OS) as the primary end point. Additional 
analyses were addressed at possible associations among polymorphisms and EGFR 
expression, toxicity, and response.
RESULTS: In 110 assessable patients, significant association with favorable OS 
was observed for EGFR intron-1 S/S and EGF 61 G/G genotypes. In the multivariate 
model, EGFR intron-1 S/S and EGF 61 G/G genotypes showed a hazard ratio of 0.41 
(95% CI, 0.21 to 0.78; P = .006) and 0.44 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.84; P = .01), 
respectively. EGFR intron-1 S/S carriers showed more frequent G2-G3 skin 
toxicity (chi(2) test = 12.7; P = .001) and treatment response (chi(2) test = 
9.45; P = .008) than EGFR intron-1 L/L carriers.
CONCLUSION: Although additional studies are required for confirmation, our 
findings could optimize the use of cetuximab in MCRC patients.
