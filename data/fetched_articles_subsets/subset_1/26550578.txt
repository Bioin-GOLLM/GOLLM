We aimed to summarize the current evidence related to the contributory role of 
genetic factors in the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and SS-related 
lymphoma. Genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus 
previously considered conferring increased susceptibility to SS development have 
been also revealed as important contributors in recent genome wide association 
studies. Moreover, genetic variations outside the MHC locus involving genes in 
type I interferon pathway, NF-κB signaling, B- and T-cell function and 
methylation processes have been shown to be associated with both SS and 
SS-related lymphoma development. Appreciating the functional implications of 
SS-related genetic variants could provide further insights into our 
understanding of SS heterogeneity, allowing the design of tailored therapeutic 
interventions.
