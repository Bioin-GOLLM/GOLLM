We used a machine learning approach to analyze the within-gene distribution of 
missense variants observed in hereditary conditions and cancer. When applied to 
840 genes from the ClinVar database, this approach detected a significant 
non-random distribution of pathogenic and benign variants in 387 (46%) and 172 
(20%) genes, respectively, revealing that variant clustering is widespread 
across the human exome. This clustering likely occurs as a consequence of 
mechanisms shaping pathogenicity at the protein level, as illustrated by the 
overlap of some clusters with known functional domains. We then took advantage 
of these findings to develop a pathogenicity predictor, MutScore, that 
integrates qualitative features of DNA substitutions with the new additional 
information derived from this positional clustering. Using a random forest 
approach, MutScore was able to identify pathogenic missense mutations with very 
high accuracy, outperforming existing predictive tools, especially for variants 
associated with autosomal-dominant disease and cancer. Thus, the within-gene 
clustering of pathogenic and benign DNA changes is an important and previously 
underappreciated feature of the human exome, which can be harnessed to improve 
the prediction of pathogenicity and disambiguation of DNA variants of uncertain 
significance.
