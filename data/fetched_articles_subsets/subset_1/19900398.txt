Lysosome-like storage organelles (LSOs) play a crucial role in excessive 
accumulation of cholesterol in the Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease 
characterized by altered vesicular traffic of lipids. Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is 
mainly present in cytosol but upon elevation of [Ca(2+)](in) binds to membranes. 
In addition, a pH or cholesterol-dependent mechanism of AnxA6 interaction with 
membranes was described. We found a several fold enrichment of AnxA6 in LSO 
compartment in fibroblasts isolated from NPC patients in comparison with 
fibroblasts from healthy individuals. We observed that AnxA6 relocates from 
cytosol to LSOs in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Cholesterol depletion caused 
reduction in the binding of AnxA6. Moreover, we found that in NPC cells AnxA6 
translocates to the perinuclear region containing late endosomes (LE) loaded 
with cholesterol. We conclude that AnxA6 may participate in formation of 
cholesterol-rich platforms on LE and therefore may contribute to the pathology 
of the NPC disease.
