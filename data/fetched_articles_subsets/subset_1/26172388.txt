BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital and heterogeneous 
disorder characterized by the absence of enteric ganglia during enteric nervous 
system (ENS) development. Our recent genome-wide association study has 
identified a variant (rs6509940) of interleukin-11 (IL-11) as a potential 
susceptible locus for HSCR. As interleukins play important roles in the ENS, we 
further studied associations with HSCR of nine common single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) on IL-11.
METHODS: Biopsy specimens or surgical materials from all patients that were 
tested for histological examination based on the absence of the enteric ganglia 
were collected. A total of nine SNPs on IL-11 were genotyped in 187 HSCR 
patients and 283 unaffected controls using TaqMan genotyping assay.
KEY RESULTS: Combined analysis revealed that several SNPs (minimum 
p = 1.57 × 10(-7) ) showed statistically significant associations with HSCR, 
even after Bonferroni correction (pcorr  = 1.73 × 10(-6) for the SNP). Moreover, 
the most common haplotype was strongly associated with HSCR (pcorr 
 = 2.20 × 10(-6) ). In further analysis among three HSCR subtypes (short 
segment, S-HSCR; long segment, L-HSCR; total colonic aganglionosis, TCA) based 
on the extent of aganglionic segment, the result showed a different association 
pattern depending on the subtypes (minimum pcorr  = 6.12 × 10(-5) for rs6509940 
in S-HSCR; but no significant SNP in L-HSCR and TCA).
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Although further replication in a larger cohort and 
functional evaluations are needed, our findings suggest that genetic variations 
of IL-11 may be associated with the risk of HSCR and/or the mechanisms related 
to ENS development.
