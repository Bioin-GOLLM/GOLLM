The central nervous system (CNS) plays key role in the homeostatic regulation of 
body weight. Satiation and adiposity signals, providing acute and chronic 
information about available fuel, are produced in the periphery and act in the 
brain to influence energy intake and expenditure, resulting in the maintenance 
of stable adiposity. Diet-induced obesity (DIO) does not result from a failure 
of these central homeostatic circuits. Rather, the threshold for defended 
adiposity is increased in environments providing ubiquitous access to palatable, 
high-fat foods, making it difficult to achieve and maintain weight loss. 
Consequently, mechanisms by which nutritional environments interact with central 
homeostatic circuits to influence the threshold for defended adiposity represent 
critical targets for therapeutic intervention.
