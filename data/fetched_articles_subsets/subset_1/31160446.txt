Lateral transmembrane (TM) helix-helix interactions between single-span membrane 
proteins play an important role in the assembly and signaling of many 
cell-surface receptors. Often, these helices contain two highly conserved yet 
distinct interaction motifs, arranged such that the motifs cannot be engaged 
simultaneously. However, there is sparse experimental evidence that 
dual-engagement mechanisms play a role in biological signaling. Here, we 
investigate the function of the two conserved interaction motifs in the TM 
domain of the integrin β3-subunit. The first motif uses reciprocating 
"large-large-small" amino acid packing to mediate the interaction of the β3 and 
αIIb TM domains and maintain the inactive resting conformation of the platelet 
integrin αIIbβ3. The second motif, S-x3-A-x3-I, is a variant of the classical 
"G-x3-G" motif. Using site-directed mutagenesis, optical trap-based force 
spectroscopy, and molecular modeling, we show that S-x3-A-x3-I does not engage 
αIIb but rather mediates the interaction of the β3 TM domain with the TM domain 
of the αv-subunit of the integrin αvβ3. Like αIIbβ3, αvβ3 on circulating 
platelets is inactive, and in the absence of platelet stimulation is unable to 
interact with components of the subendothelial matrix. However, disrupting any 
residue in the β3 S-x3-A-x3-I motif by site-directed mutations is sufficient to 
induce αvβ3 binding to the αvβ3 ligand osteopontin and to the monoclonal 
antibody WOW-1. Thus, the β3-integrin TM domain is able to engage in two 
mutually exclusive interactions that produce alternate α-subunit pairing, 
creating two integrins with distinct biological functions.
