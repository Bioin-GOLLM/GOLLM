R.DpnI consists of N-terminal catalytic and C-terminal winged helix domains that 
are separately specific for the Gm6ATC sequences in Dam-methylated DNA. Here we 
present a crystal structure of R.DpnI with oligoduplexes bound to the catalytic 
and winged helix domains and identify the catalytic domain residues that are 
involved in interactions with the substrate methyl groups. We show that these 
methyl groups in the Gm6ATC target sequence are positioned very close to each 
other. We further show that the presence of the two methyl groups requires a 
deviation from B-DNA conformation to avoid steric conflict. The methylation 
compatible DNA conformation is complementary with binding sites of both R.DpnI 
domains. This indirect readout of methylation adds to the specificity mediated 
by direct favorable interactions with the methyl groups and 
solvation/desolvation effects. We also present hydrogen/deuterium exchange data 
that support 'crosstalk' between the two domains in the identification of 
methylated DNA, which should further enhance R.DpnI methylation specificity.
