PURPOSE: To determine the characteristics of conjunctivitis associated with 
human adenovirus E4 (AdV E4).
METHODS: Samples and outcomes from 500 patients with conjunctivitis were 
obtained from the NVC-422 randomized controlled clinical trial comparing 
auriclosene to placebo. Molecular typing identified 36 cases associated with AdV 
E4. Signs and symptoms at presentation and at the day 18 endpoint were compared 
with the larger cohort of 262 subjects with conjunctivitis caused by due to AdV 
D8. Full viral genomes of 22 AdV E4 isolates were reconstructed.
RESULTS: AdV E4 was the most frequently identified adenoviral type in 
conjunctivitis cases from the United States. Signs and symptoms at presentation 
were comparable to those associated with AdV D8. Viral load at presentation was 
comparable between groups but resolution was more rapid in the AdV E4 group. 
Clinical signs were fully resolved by day 18 in 26 of 36 (72%) patients with AdV 
E4. Subepithelial infiltrates developed in 12 of 36 (33%) patients with AdV E4 
compared with 98 of 215 (45%) patients with AdV D8 (P = .0001). One hundred 
twenty-four polymorphisms were observed among 22 whole viral genome sequences, 
which clustered into 3 clades. Patients in each clade developed subepithelial 
infiltrates. Neither single nucleotide polymorphism analysis nor machine 
learning approaches identified specific sequence features predictive of 
presenting signs or outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: AdV E4 conjunctivitis may be indistinguishable at presentation from 
AdV D8-associated disease. Resolution of viral load for AdV E4 appears more 
rapid than for AdV D8, and the risk for subepithelial infiltrates appears lower. 
Multiple substrains of AdV E4 are in circulation but all appeared equivalently 
pathogenic for conjunctivitis. NOTE: Publication of this article is sponsored by
