Covering: 2000 to 2019Natural products (NPs) are important sources of human 
therapeutic agents and pesticides. To prevent self-harm from bioactive NPs, some 
microbial producers employ self-resistance genes to protect themselves. One 
effective strategy is to employ a self-resistance enzyme (SRE), which is a 
slightly mutated version of the original metabolic enzyme, and is resistant to 
the toxic NP but is still functional. The presence of a SRE in a gene cluster 
can serve as a predictive window to the biological activity of the NPs 
synthesized by the pathway. In this highlight, we summarize representative 
examples of NP biosynthetic pathways that utilize self-resistance genes for 
protection. Recent discoveries based on self-resistance gene identification have 
helped in bridging the gap between activity-guided and genome-driven approaches 
for NP discovery and functional assignment.
