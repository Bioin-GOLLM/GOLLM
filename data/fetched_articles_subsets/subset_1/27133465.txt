The strength and variability of electrical synaptic connections between 
GABAergic interneurons are key determinants of spike synchrony within neuronal 
networks. However, little is known about how electrical coupling strength is 
determined due to the inaccessibility of gap junctions on the dendritic tree. We 
investigated the properties of gap junctions in cerebellar interneurons by 
combining paired somato-somatic and somato-dendritic recordings, anatomical 
reconstructions, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and modeling. By 
fitting detailed compartmental models of Golgi cells to their somato-dendritic 
voltage responses, we determined their passive electrical properties and the 
mean gap junction conductance (0.9 nS). Connexin36 immunofluorescence and 
freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling revealed a large variability in gap 
junction size and that only 18% of the 340 channels are open in each plaque. Our 
results establish that the number of gap junctions per connection is the main 
determinant of both the strength and variability in electrical coupling between 
Golgi cells.
