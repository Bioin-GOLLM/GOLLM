OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of the CYP1B1 (Cytochrome P450, 
family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1) gene mutations in primary congenital 
glaucoma (PCG) in Hunan Province.
METHODS: Case-control study. Thirteen cases of PCG from different districts of 
Hunan province were collected in this study. Direct sequencing was used to 
evaluate the coding and the promoter regions of the CYP1B1 gene in PCG patients.
RESULTS: A novel pathogenic mutation (c.C319G, L107V) was identified in a PCG 
patient in our study and it was a missense mutation in exon 2. Additionally, 
four single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) were found in PCG patients, including 
R48G, A119S, V432L and D449D.
CONCLUSION: A novel CYP1B1 gene mutation (L107V) may be the cause for primary 
congenital glaucoma in Hunan Province.
