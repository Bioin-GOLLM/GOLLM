The title compound, (C(19)H(15)N(4))(2)[Co(NCS)(4)], has two 
crystallographycally different molecules of bis-(2,3,5-triphenyl-tetra-zolium) 
tetra-thio-cyanatecobaltate in the asymmetric unit. There are only minor 
geometric differences between them. Each cobalt(II) ion is coordinated by the N 
atoms of four NCS anions, showing the magnitude of the magnetic moment expected 
from the NCS(-) crystal field strength.
