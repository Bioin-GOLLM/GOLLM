Using immunostaining with anti-prion protein (PrP) antiserum, we detected 
numerous kuru plaques in the brain of a 24-year-old man with 
Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome. Immunoreactivity on Western blotting of 
the protease-resistant PrP fraction from the frozen brain was weak. PrP gene 
analysis showed substitution of alanine to valine in codon 117 but no 
substitution in codon 102. As the experimental transmission of the disease to 
mice was negative, a pathogen of a relatively low infectivity may cause the 
disease in predisposed family members.
