The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway plays an important 
role in neuronal cell differentiation. Recent studies have shown that IGF-1 has 
the capacity to counteract the retraction of neuronal processes in response to 
inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, which is a known factor for neuronal 
injury in the central nervous system. This event is thought to be mediated via 
interference of TNF-α-induced interaction of β1-integrin with insulin receptor 
substrate-1 (IRS-1). Here, we demonstrate the interaction of IRS-1 with 
disintegrin and metalloproteinase ADAM10 through the N-terminal domain of IRS-1 
and that this is involved in the regulation of neurite extension and retraction 
by IGF-1 and TNF-α, respectively. PC12 cells expressing the N-terminal domain 
show enhanced neurite extension after IGF-1 treatment and reduced neurite 
depletion relative to control cells after TNF-α treatment. The level of ADAM10 
was found to be increased in immunohistochemical studies of HIV encephalitis 
clinical samples and is present with TNF-α and TNFR1 in both astrocytes and 
neurons. Altogether, these observations suggest a role for ADAM10 in the 
mechanism for IGF1/IRS-1 signaling pathway in sustaining the stability of 
neuronal processes.
