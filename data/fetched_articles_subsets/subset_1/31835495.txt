This open-label, phase I first-in-human study (NCT01915576) of BAY 1125976, a 
highly specific and potent allosteric inhibitor of AKT1/2, aimed to evaluate the 
safety, pharmacokinetics, and maximum tolerated dose of BAY 1125976 in patients 
with advanced solid tumors. Oral dose escalation was investigated with a 
continuous once daily (QD) treatment (21 days/cycle) and a twice daily (BID) 
schedule. A dose expansion in 28 patients with hormone receptor-positive 
metastatic breast cancer, including nine patients harboring the AKT1E17K 
mutation, was performed at the recommended phase 2 dose (R2D) of 60 mg BID. 
Dose-limiting toxicities (Grades 3-4) were increased in transaminases, 
γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT), and alkaline phosphatase in four patients in both 
schedules and stomach pain in one patient. Of the 78 patients enrolled, one 
patient had a partial response, 30 had stable disease, and 38 had progressive 
disease. The clinical benefit rate was 27.9% among 43 patients treated at the 
R2D. AKT1E17K mutation status was not associated with tumor response. Genetic 
analyses revealed additional mutations that could promote tumor cell growth 
despite the inhibition of AKT1/2. BAY 1125976 was well tolerated and inhibited 
AKT1/2 signaling but did not lead to radiologic or clinical tumor responses. 
Thus, the refinement of a selection of biomarkers for AKT inhibitors is needed 
to improve their monotherapy activity.
