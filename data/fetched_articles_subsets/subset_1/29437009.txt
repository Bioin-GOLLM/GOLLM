BACKGROUND: The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein families are a large class 
of transcription factors, which are associated with cell proliferation, tissue 
differentiation, and other important development processes. We reported that the 
Nuclear localized protein-1 (Nulp1) might act as a novel bHLH transcriptional 
factor to mediate cellular functions. However, its role in development in vivo 
remains unknown.
METHODS: Nulp1 (dNulp1) mutants are generated by CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the 
Domain of Unknown Function (DUF654) in its C terminal. Expression of Wg target 
genes are analyzed by qRT-PCR. We use the Top-Flash luciferase reporter assay to 
response to Wg signaling.
RESULTS: Here we show that Drosophila Nulp1 (dNulp1) mutants, generated by 
CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the Domain of Unknown Function (DUF654) in its C terminal, 
are partially homozygous lethal and the rare escapers have bent femurs, which 
are similar to the major manifestation of congenital bent-bone dysplasia in 
human Stuve- Weidemann syndrome. The fly phenotype can be rescued by dNulp1 
over-expression, indicating that dNulp1 is essential for fly femur development 
and survival. Moreover, dNulp1 overexpression suppresses the notch wing 
phenotype caused by the overexpression of sgg/GSK3β, an inhibitor of the 
canonical Wnt cascade. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analyses show that seven target 
genes positively regulated by Wg signaling pathway are down-regulated in 
response to dNulp1 knockout, while two negatively regulated Wg targets are 
up-regulated in dNulp1 mutants. Finally, dNulp1 overexpression significantly 
activates the Top-Flash Wnt signaling reporter.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that bHLH protein dNulp1 is essential for femur 
development and survival in Drosophila by acting as a positive cofactor in 
Wnt/Wingless signaling.
