The efficacy of cancer immunotherapy is limited, in part, by the multitude of 
immunosuppressive mechanisms present within the tumor microenvironment (TME). 
Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a lectin that contributes to TME immunosuppression and 
regulates diverse functions including cellular homeostasis and cancer biology. 
Increased Gal-3 expression during cancer progression augments tumor growth, 
invasiveness, metastatic potential, and immune suppression, which highlights the 
potential use of Gal-3 as a therapeutic target capable of modulating anti-tumor 
immunity. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which Gal-3 regulates lymphocytes, 
the role of Gal-3 in lung and prostate tumors, and the contribution of Gal-3 to 
TME immunosuppression.
