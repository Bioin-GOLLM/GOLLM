Mutational processes occur in normal tissues from conception throughout life. 
Field cancerization describes the preconditioning of an area of epithelium to 
tumor growth. Pre-invasive lesions may arise in these fields, however only a 
minority of pre-invasive neoplasia progresses to overt malignancy. Within this 
review we discuss recent advances in our understanding of genomic instability 
processes in normal tissue, describe evolutionary dynamics in pre-invasive 
disease and highlight current evidence describing how increasing genomic 
instability may drive the transition from pre-invasive to invasive disease. 
Appreciation of the evolutionary rulebooks that operate in pre-invasive 
neoplasia may facilitate screening strategies, risk-stratification of 
pre-invasive lesions and precipitate novel preventative treatments in at-risk 
patient populations.
