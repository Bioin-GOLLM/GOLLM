Artificial light produces an emission spectrum that is considerably different 
than the solar spectrum. Artificial light has been shown to affect various 
behavior and physiological processes in vertebrates. However, there exists a 
paucity of data regarding the molecular genetic effects of artificial light 
exposure. Previous studies showed that one of the commonly used fluorescent 
light source (FL; 4100K or "cool white") can affect signaling pathways related 
to maintenance of circadian rhythm, cell cycle progression, chromosome 
segregation, and DNA repair/recombination in the skin of male Xiphophorus 
maculatus. These observations raise questions concerning the kinetics of the FL 
induced gene expression response, and which biological functions become 
modulated at various times after light exposure. To address these questions, we 
exposed zebrafish to 4100K FL and utilized RNA-Seq to assess gene expression 
changes in skin at various times (1 to 12h) after FL exposure. We found 4100K FL 
incites a robust early (1-2h) transcriptional response, followed by a more 
protracted late response (i.e., 4-12h). The early transcriptional response 
involves genes associated with cell migration/infiltration and cell 
proliferation as part of an overall increase in immune function and 
inflammation. The protracted late transcriptional response occurs within gene 
sets predicted to maintain and perpetuate the inflammatory response, as well as 
suppression of lipid, xenobiotic, and melatonin metabolism.
