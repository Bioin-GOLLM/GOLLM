Corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD) is a congenital disorder that incorporates 
either partial or complete absence of the largest cerebral commissure. 
Remodelling of the interhemispheric fissure (IHF) provides a substrate for 
callosal axons to cross between hemispheres, and its failure is the main cause 
of complete CCD. However, it is unclear whether defects in this process could 
give rise to the heterogeneity of expressivity and phenotypes seen in human 
cases of CCD. We identify incomplete IHF remodelling as the key structural 
correlate for the range of callosal abnormalities in inbred and outcrossed BTBR 
mouse strains, as well as in humans with partial CCD. We identify an eight 
base-pair deletion in Draxin and misregulated astroglial and leptomeningeal 
proliferation as genetic and cellular factors for variable IHF remodelling and 
CCD in BTBR strains. These findings support a model where genetic events 
determine corpus callosum structure by influencing leptomeningeal-astroglial 
interactions at the IHF.
