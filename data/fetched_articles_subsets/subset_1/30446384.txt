Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are important for mucosal immunity. The intestine 
harbors all ILC subsets, but how these cells are balanced to achieve immune 
homeostasis and mount appropriate responses during infection remains elusive. 
Here, we show that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) expression in the gut 
regulates ILC balance. Among ILCs, Ahr is most highly expressed by gut ILC2s and 
controls chromatin accessibility at the Ahr locus via positive feedback. Ahr 
signaling suppresses Gfi1 transcription-factor-mediated expression of the 
interleukin-33 (IL-33) receptor ST2 in ILC2s and expression of ILC2 effector 
molecules IL-5, IL-13, and amphiregulin in a cell-intrinsic manner. Ablation of 
Ahr enhances anti-helminth immunity in the gut, whereas genetic or 
pharmacological activation of Ahr suppresses ILC2 function but enhances ILC3 
maintenance to protect the host from Citrobacter rodentium infection. Thus, the 
host regulates the gut ILC2-ILC3 balance by engaging the Ahr pathway to mount 
appropriate immunity against various pathogens.
