ABO genotyping is used in several disciplines, including transfusion, 
transplantation, human evolution, and forensic medicine. Detection of single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a locus is a common way to identify different 
genotypes. In this study we developed a strategy for ABO genotyping, which can 
rapidly and efficiently detect SNPs. DNA fragments containing 4 SNPs in the ABO 
gene (c.261delG, c.297A > G, c.1009A > G, and c.1061delC) were amplified using 
individually and multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods and 
subsequently genotyped by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Human blood 
ABO genotypes from 92 samples were successfully determined by HRM analysis. A 
total of 14 genotypes (A/A, A/O01, A/O02, A201/O01, A205/O01, B/B, B/O01, B/O02, 
A/B, A201/B, A205/B, O01/O01, O02/O02, O01/O02) were identified by analysis of 
the 4 SNPs of interest in this study. The results suggest that the present HRM 
assay is a reliable and rapid method for ABO blood type genotyping and it may 
offer an alternative to traditional genotyping methods.
