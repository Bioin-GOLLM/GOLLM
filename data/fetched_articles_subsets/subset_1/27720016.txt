BACKGROUND: Children with asthma in low-income urban areas have high morbidity. 
Phenotypic analysis in these children is lacking, but may identify 
characteristics to inform successful tailored management approaches.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify distinct asthma phenotypes among inner-city 
children receiving guidelines-based management.
METHODS: Nine inner-city asthma consortium centers enrolled 717 children aged 6 
to 17 years. Data were collected at baseline and prospectively every 2 months 
for 1 year. Participants' asthma and rhinitis were optimally managed by study 
physicians on the basis of guidelines. Cluster analysis using 50 baseline and 12 
longitudinal variables was performed in 616 participants completing 4 or more 
follow-up visits.
RESULTS: Five clusters (designated A through E) were distinguished by indicators 
of asthma and rhinitis severity, pulmonary physiology, allergy (sensitization 
and total serum IgE), and allergic inflammation. In comparison to other 
clusters, cluster A was distinguished by lower allergy/inflammation, minimally 
symptomatic asthma and rhinitis, and normal pulmonary physiology. Cluster B had 
highly symptomatic asthma despite high step-level treatment, lower allergy and 
inflammation, and mildly altered pulmonary physiology. Cluster C had minimally 
symptomatic asthma and rhinitis, intermediate allergy and inflammation, and 
mildly impaired pulmonary physiology. Clusters D and E exhibited progressively 
higher asthma and rhinitis symptoms and allergy/inflammation. Cluster E had the 
most symptomatic asthma while receiving high step-level treatment and had the 
highest total serum IgE level (median, 733 kU/L), blood eosinophil count 
(median, 400 cells/mm3), and allergen sensitizations (15 of 22 tested).
CONCLUSIONS: Allergy distinguishes asthma phenotypes in urban children. Severe 
asthma often coclusters with highly allergic children. However, a symptomatic 
phenotype with little allergy or allergic inflammation was identified.
