PURPOSE: The association between GNB3 C825T polymorphism and cancer risk has 
been investigated. However, results remain inconclusive. In this study we aimed 
to obtain a more precise estimation of this association.
METHODS: A meta-analysis of 8 eligible studies including 1,812 cancer cases and 
3,731 controls was conducted with odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval (95% CI).
RESULTS: The results demonstrated a borderline association between the GNB3 
C825T polymorphism and the risk of overall cancer in the dominant model (TT+TC 
vs CC, OR=1.13, 95% CI=1.00-1.28, PH=0.71, p=0.05). In the stratified analysis 
by cancer type, significant association of cancer risk was observed in thyroid 
carcinoma (TC vs CC, OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.02-1.54, PH=0.63, p=0.03; TT+TC vs CC, 
OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.02-1.51, PH=0.70, p=0.04). After further stratified analysis 
based on country, the GNB3 C825T polymorphism showed statistically significant 
association with increased risk of cancer in Austria (TT vs CC, OR=1.44, 95% 
CI=1.01-2.04, PH-0.88, p-0.04; TT vs TT+TC, OR=1.49, 95% CI=1.07-2.64, PH=0.87, 
p=0.02) and Germany (TC vs CC, OR=1.25, 95% CI=1.02-1.53; PH=0.87, p=0.03; TT+TC 
vs CC, OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.02-1.49, PH-0.90, p-0.04).
CONCLUSION: The current meta-analysis suggested that the GNB3 C825T polymorphism 
may contribute to increased risk of cancer, especially of thyroid carcinoma.
