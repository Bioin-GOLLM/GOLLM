Staphylococcus aureus is an important bacterial pathogen causing bovine 
mastitis, but little is known about the virulence factor and the inflammatory 
responses in the mammary infection. Staphylococcal enterotoxin C (SEC) is the 
most frequent toxin produced by S. aureus, isolated from bovine mastitis. To 
investigate the pathogenic activity of SEC in the inflammation of the mammary 
gland and the immune responses in an animal model, mouse mammary glands were 
injected with SEC, and the clinical signs, inflammatory cell infiltration, and 
proinflammatory cytokine production in the mammary glands were assessed. SEC 
induced significant inflammatory reactions in the mammary gland, in a 
dose-dependent manner. SEC-injected mammary glands showed a severe inflammation 
with inflammatory cell infiltration and tissue damage. In addition, interleukin 
(IL)-1Î² and IL-6 production in the SEC-injected mammary glands were 
significantly higher than those in the PBS control glands. Furthermore, the 
SEC-induced inflammation and tissue damage in the mammary gland were 
specifically inhibited by anti-SEC antibody. These results indicated, for the 
first time, that SEC can directly cause inflammation, proinflammatory cytokine 
production, and tissue damage in mammary glands, suggesting that SEC might play 
an important role in the development of mastitis associated with S. aureus 
infection. This finding offers an opportunity to develop novel treatment 
strategies for reduction of mammary tissue damage in mastitis.
