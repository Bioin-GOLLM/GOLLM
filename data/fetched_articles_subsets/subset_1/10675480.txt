Functional defects in DNA mismatch repair genes have been shown to be associated 
mainly with hereditary human malignancies. We examined genomic DNA from 88 
sporadic transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) of the urinary tract for mutations 
in hMSH6 gene by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing analysis. 
Mutational status of p53 gene was also studied as a potential target of genetic 
instability secondary to hMSH6 dysfunction. A total of 5 cases (5.7%: 5/88) 
displayed hMSH6 mutations all consisted of transition and located in exon 4, 
including three cases with missense mutation and two without change of 
corresponding amino acid. These three tumors with hMSH6 missense mutation had no 
microsatellite instability with five microsatellite markers tested. p53 gene 
mutations were detected in 22 cases (25.0%: 22/88). No tumors with p53 mutation 
had any hMSH6 missense mutations. Compared to the cases without hMSH6 
alterations, the three patients with hMSH6 alterations had more frequent 
additional primary cancer (P<0.05). These findings provide the first in vivo 
evidence for the type of alterations and frequency of possible involvement of 
the hMSH6 mutations in sporadic type urothelial TCCs.
