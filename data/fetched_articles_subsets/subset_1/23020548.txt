Chloroperoxidase, the most versatile heme protein, has a hybrid active site 
pocket that shares structural features with peroxidases and cytochrome P450s. 
The simulation studies presented here show that the enzyme possesses a 
remarkable ability to efficiently utilize its hybrid structure, assuming 
structurally different peroxidase-like and P450-like distal pocket faces and 
thereby enhancing the inherent catalytic capability of the active center. We 
find that, during epoxidation of cis-β-methylstyrene (CBMS), the native 
peroxidase-like aspect of the distal pocket is diminished as the polar Glu183 
side chain is displaced away from the active center and the distal pocket takes 
on a more hydrophobic, P450-like, aspect. The P450-like distal pocket provides a 
significant enthalpic stabilization of ∼4 kcal/mol of the 14 kcal/mol reaction 
barrier for gas-phase epoxidation of CMBS by an oxyferryl heme-thiolate species. 
This stabilization comes from breathing of the distal pocket. As until recently 
the active site of chloroperoxidase was postulated to be inflexible, these 
results suggest a new conceptual understanding of the enzyme's versatility: 
catalytic reactivity is tuned by flexibility of the distal pocket.
