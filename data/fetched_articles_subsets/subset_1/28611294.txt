PURPOSE: The present study is to discover a new genes associated with drug 
resistance development in ovarian cancer.
METHODS: We used microarray analysis to determine alterations in the level of 
expression of genes in cisplatin- (CisPt), doxorubicin- (Dox), topotecan- (Top), 
and paclitaxel- (Pac) resistant variants of W1 and A2780 ovarian cancer cell 
lines. Immunohistochemistry assay was used to determine protein expression in 
ovarian cancer patients.
RESULTS: We observed alterations in the expression of 22 genes that were common 
to all three cell lines that were resistant to the same cytostatic drug. The 
level of expression of 13 genes was upregulated and that of nine genes was 
downregulated. In the CisPt-resistant cell line, we observed downregulated 
expression of ABCC6, BST2, ERAP2 and MCTP1; in the Pac-resistant cell line, we 
observe upregulated expression of ABCB1, EPHA7 and RUNDC3B and downregulated 
expression of LIPG, MCTP1, NSBP1, PCDH9, PTPRK and SEMA3A. The expression levels 
of three genes, ABCB1, ABCB4 and IFI16, were upregulated in the Dox-resistant 
cell lines. In the Top-resistant cell lines, we observed increased expression 
levels of ABCG2, HERC5, IFIH1, MYOT, S100A3, SAMD4A, SPP1 and TGFBI and 
decreased expression levels of MCTP1 and PTPRK. The expression of EPHA7, IFI16, 
SPP1 and TGFBI was confirmed at protein level in analyzed ovarian cancer 
patients..
CONCLUSIONS: The expression profiles of the investigated cell lines indicated 
that new candidate genes are related to the development of resistance to the 
cytostatic drugs that are used in first- and second-line chemotherapy of ovarian 
cancer.
