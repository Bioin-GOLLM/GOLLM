In the context of geriatric research, a growing body of evidence links normal 
age-related changes in sleep with many adverse health outcomes, especially a 
decline in cognition in older adults. The most important sleep alterations that 
continue to worsen after 60 years involve sleep timing, (especially early wake 
time, phase advance), sleep maintenance (continuity of sleep interrupted by 
numerous awakenings) and reduced amount of sigma activity (during non-rapid eye 
movement (NREM) sleep) associated with modifications of sleep spindle 
characteristics (density, amplitude, frequency) and spindle-Slow Wave coupling. 
After 60 years, there is a very clear gender-dependent deterioration in sleep. 
Even if there are degradations of sleep after 60 years, daytime wake level and 
especially daytime sleepiness is not modified with age. On the other hand, under 
sleep deprivation condition, older adults show smaller cognitive impairments 
than younger adults, suggesting an age-related lower vulnerability to extended 
wakefulness. These sleep and cognitive age-related modifications would be due to 
a reduced homeostatic drive and consequently a reduced sleep need, an 
attenuation of circadian drive (reduction of sleep forbidden zone in late 
afternoon and wake forbidden zone in early morning), a modification of the 
interaction of the circadian and homeostatic processes and/or an alteration of 
subcortical structures involved in generation of circadian and homeostatic 
drive, or connections to the cerebral cortex with age. The modifications and 
interactions of these two processes with age are still uncertain, and still 
require further investigation. The understanding of the respective contribution 
of circadian and homeostatic processes in the regulation of neurobehavioral 
function with aging present a challenge for improving health, management of 
cognitive decline and potential early chronobiological or sleep-wake 
interventions.
