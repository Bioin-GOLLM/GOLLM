BACKGROUND: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been 
shown to upregulate gene transcription during tumorigenesis. However, how STAT3 
initiates transcription remains to be exploited. This study is to reveal the 
role of CREPT (cell cycle-related and elevated-expression protein in tumours, or 
RPRD1B) in promoting STAT3 transcriptional activity.
METHODS: BALB/c nude mice, CREPT overexpression or deletion cells were employed 
for the assay of tumour formation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, assay for 
transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that CREPT, a recently identified oncoprotein, enhances 
STAT3 transcriptional activity to promote tumorigenesis. CREPT expression is 
positively correlated with activation of STAT3 signalling in tumours. Deletion 
of CREPT led to a decrease, but overexpression of CREPT resulted in an increase, 
in STAT3-initiated tumour cell proliferation, colony formation and tumour 
growth. Mechanistically, CREPT interacts with phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and 
facilitates p-STAT3 to recruit p300 to occupy at the promoters of STAT3-targeted 
genes. Therefore, CREPT and STAT3 coordinately facilitate p300-mediated 
acetylation of histone 3 (H3K18ac and H3K27ac), further augmenting RNA 
polymerase II recruitment. Accordingly, depletion of p300 abolished 
CREPT-enhanced STAT3 transcriptional activity.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that CREPT is a co-activator of STAT3 for recruiting 
p300. Our study provides an alternative strategy for the therapy of cancers 
related to STAT3.
