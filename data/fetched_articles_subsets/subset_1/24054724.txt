We report a case of oligodendroglioma showing marked neuronal differentiation, 
which arose in the right frontal lobe of a 46-year-old woman. The resected tumor 
was composed of a mixture of oligodendroglioma, gangliocytoma, and neurocytoma 
areas with predominance of gangliocytoma-like areas. The oligodendroglioma areas 
showed immunoreactivity for Olig2 and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 protein, 
whereas the gangliocytoma and neurocytoma areas were positive for synaptophysin 
and NeuN. Ki-67 labeling index was approximately 5% to 10% in the 
oligodendroglioma areas. Molecular cytogenetic analyses demonstrated chromosomal 
losses of 1p and 19q and a mutation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (G395A, R132H) 
in both the oligodendroglioma and gangliocytoma areas. These data suggest that 
this tumor is an oligodendroglioma associated with prominent neuronal 
differentiation. There seems to be a close relationship between oligodendroglial 
progenitor cells and neuronal cells.
