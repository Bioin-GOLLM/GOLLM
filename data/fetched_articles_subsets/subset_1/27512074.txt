The emergence of transmissible HIV-1 strains with resistance to antiretroviral 
drugs highlights a continual need for new therapies. Here we describe a novel 
acylguanidine-containing compound, 1-(2-(azepan-1-yl)nicotinoyl)guanidine (or 
SM111), that inhibits in vitro replication of HIV-1, including strains resistant 
to licensed protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase inhibitors, without 
major cellular toxicity. At inhibitory concentrations, intracellular p24(Gag) 
production was unaffected, but virion release (measured as extracellular 
p24(Gag)) was reduced and virion infectivity was substantially impaired, 
suggesting that SM111 acts at a late stage of viral replication. SM111-mediated 
inhibition of HIV-1 was partially overcome by a Vpu I17R mutation alone or a Vpu 
W22* truncation in combination with Env N136Y. These mutations enhanced virion 
infectivity and Env expression on the surface of infected cells in the absence 
and presence of SM111 but also impaired Vpu's ability to downregulate CD4 and 
BST2/tetherin. Taken together, our results support acylguanidines as a class of 
HIV-1 inhibitors with a distinct mechanism of action compared to that of 
licensed antiretrovirals. Further research on SM111 and similar compounds may 
help to elucidate knowledge gaps related to Vpu's role in promoting viral egress 
and infectivity.
IMPORTANCE: New inhibitors of HIV-1 replication may be useful as therapeutics to 
counteract drug resistance and as reagents to perform more detailed studies of 
viral pathogenesis. SM111 is a small molecule that blocks the replication of 
wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 strains by impairing viral release and 
substantially reducing virion infectivity, most likely through its ability to 
prevent Env expression at the infected cell surface. Partial resistance to SM111 
is mediated by mutations in Vpu and/or Env, suggesting that the compound affects 
host/viral protein interactions that are important during viral egress. Further 
characterization of SM111 and similar compounds may allow more detailed 
pharmacological studies of HIV-1 egress and provide opportunities to develop new 
treatments for HIV-1.
