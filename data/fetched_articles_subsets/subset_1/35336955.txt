Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common non-viral cause of sexually transmitted 
infections globally. Infection by this protozoan parasite results in the 
clinical syndrome trichomoniasis, which manifests as an inflammatory disease 
with acute and chronic consequences. Half or more isolates of this parasite are 
themselves infected with one or more dsRNA viruses that can exacerbate the 
inflammatory syndrome. At least four distinct viruses have been identified in T. 
vaginalis to date, constituting species Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 through 
Trichomonas vaginalis virus 4 in genus Trichomonasvirus. Despite the global 
prevalence of these viruses, few complete coding sequences have been reported. 
We conducted viral sequence mining in publicly available transcriptomes across 
60 RNA-Seq accessions representing at least 13 distinct T. vaginalis isolates. 
The results led to sequence assemblies for 27 novel trichomonasvirus strains 
across all four recognized species. Using a strategy of de novo sequence 
assembly followed by taxonomic classification, we additionally discovered six 
strains of a newly identified fifth species, for which we propose the name 
Trichomonas vaginalis virus 5, also in genus Trichomonasvirus. These additional 
strains exhibit high sequence identity to each other, but low sequence identity 
to strains of the other four species. Phylogenetic analyses corroborate the 
species-level designations. These results substantially increase the number of 
trichomonasvirus genome sequences and demonstrate the utility of mining publicly 
available transcriptomes for virus discovery in a critical human pathogen.
