Lynch syndrome is the most common form of hereditary colorectal carcinoma. 
However, establishing the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is challenging, and 
ancillary studies that distinguish between sporadic DNA mismatch repair (MMR) 
protein deficiency and Lynch syndrome are needed, particularly when germline 
mutation studies are inconclusive. The aim of this study was to determine if MMR 
protein-deficient non-neoplastic intestinal crypts can help distinguish between 
patients with and without Lynch syndrome. We evaluated the expression of MMR 
proteins in non-neoplastic intestinal mucosa obtained from colorectal surgical 
resection specimens from patients with Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal 
carcinoma (n = 52) and patients with colorectal carcinoma without evidence of 
Lynch syndrome (n = 70), including sporadic MMR protein-deficient colorectal 
carcinoma (n = 30), MMR protein proficient colorectal carcinoma (n = 30), and 
"Lynch-like" syndrome (n = 10). MMR protein-deficient non-neoplastic colonic 
crypts were identified in 19 of 122 (16%) patients. MMR protein-deficient 
colonic crypts were identified in 18 of 52 (35%) patients with Lynch syndrome 
compared to only 1 of 70 (1%) patients without Lynch syndrome (p < 0.001). This 
one patient had "Lynch-like" syndrome and harbored two MSH2-deficient 
non-neoplastic colonic crypts. MMR protein-deficient non-neoplastic colonic 
crypts were not identified in patients with sporadic MMR protein-deficient or 
MMR protein proficient colorectal carcinoma. Our findings suggest that MMR 
protein-deficient colonic crypts are a novel indicator of Lynch syndrome, and 
evaluation for MMR protein-deficient crypts may be a helpful addition to Lynch 
syndrome diagnostics.
