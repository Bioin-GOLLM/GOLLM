Fibrinogen Matsumoto V (M-V) is a dysfibrinogen identified in a 52-year-old 
woman with systemic lupus erythematous. The triplet AGG encoding the amino acid 
residue Aalpha19 was replaced by GGG, resulting in the substitution of 
Arg-->Gly. Residue Aalpha19 has been shown to be one of the most important amino 
acids in the so-called 'A' site or alpha-chain knob. The thrombin-catalyzed 
release of fibrinopeptide A from M-V fibrinogen was only slightly delayed yet 
release of fibrinopeptide B was significantly delayed. Both thrombin-catalyzed 
fibrin polymerization and fibrin monomer polymerization were markedly impaired 
compared to normal fibrinogen. In addition, reptilase-catalyzed fibrin 
polymerization of M-V was much more impaired than thrombin-catalyzed fibrin 
polymerization. These results indicate 'B' and/or 'b' site of M-V fibrinogen 
play a more important role in thrombin-catalyzed fibrin polymerization than that 
of normal control fibrinogen.
