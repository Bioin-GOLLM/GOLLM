The title compound, [Pt(C(13)H(10)ClN(2)S)Cl], contains a Pt atom 
tetra-coordinated by a benzene C, a diazene N, a Cl and an S atom in an 
approximately square-planar geometry. The mol-ecules dimerize through a 
nonbonded S⋯S inter-action [S⋯S = 3.523 (18) Å]. There are no hydrogen bonds and 
the crystal packing is stabilized by four inter-molecular π-π inter-actions; the 
centroid-centroid distances are 3.804 (3), 3.638 (3), 3.804 (3) and 3.638 (3) Å, 
and the corresponding perpendicular distances are 3.369, 3.448, 3.406 and 
3.466 Å.
