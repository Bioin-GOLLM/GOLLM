A rare case of extensive multiple idiopathic cervical root resorption with 
potential genetic predisposition was presented. A heathy 19-year-old Chinese 
male with no contributory medical or family/social history complained of pain 
during mastication that lasted for several months. Oral examination identified 7 
missing teeth and external cervical root resorption involving 9 teeth. 
Comparison of orthopantomograms taken in May 2021 and February 2022 identified 
that cervical root resorption occurred in 22 teeth. Resorption commenced at the 
cementoenamel junction and progressed rapidly over the 9-month period. 
Laboratory test results were within normal limits. Trio-based whole-exome 
sequencing showed a missense mutation c.5630 C > T in the filamin A (FLNA) gene 
at chromosome X of the subject. This is suggestive of the possibility of 
sex-linked recessive inheritance. This is the first study to report FLNA 
mutation in human subjects with cervical root resorption involving multiple 
teeth.
