The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are ligands of PPARγ that improve insulin 
sensitivity, but their use is limited by significant side effects. Recently, we 
demonstrated a mechanism wherein TZDs improve insulin sensitivity distinct from 
receptor agonism and adipogenesis: reversal of obesity-linked phosphorylation of 
PPARγ at serine 273. However, the role of this modification hasn't been tested 
genetically. Here we demonstrate that mice encoding an allele of PPARγ that 
cannot be phosphorylated at S273 are protected from insulin resistance, without 
exhibiting differences in body weight or TZD-associated side effects. Indeed, 
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp experiments confirm insulin sensitivity. 
RNA-seq in these mice reveals reduced expression of Gdf3, a BMP family member. 
Ectopic expression of Gdf3 is sufficient to induce insulin resistance in lean, 
healthy mice. We find Gdf3 inhibits BMP signaling and insulin signaling 
in vitro. Together, these results highlight the diabetogenic role of PPARγ S273 
phosphorylation and focus attention on a putative target, Gdf3.
