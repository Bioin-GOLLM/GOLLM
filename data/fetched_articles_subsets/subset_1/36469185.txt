Liver cirrhosis due to secondary sclerosing cholangitis caused by Langerhans 
cell histiocytosis (LCH) has a poor prognosis, and liver transplantation is the 
definitive treatment. However, the optimal timing has not been established. We 
report a 2-year-old girl with LCH-related liver cirrhosis who successfully 
underwent liver transplantation before progressing to severe liver dysfunction. 
Physical examination revealed a tumor on her palate. Biopsy was performed, and a 
diagnosis of LCH was established, together with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and 
rashes. Percutaneous liver biopsy before treatment revealed extreme fibrosis and 
absence of LCH cells. After beginning chemotherapy, she experienced several 
delays in treatment and dose reductions because of unacceptable bone marrow 
suppression, worsening liver dysfunction, and cholangitis. However, tumor 
shrinkage was observed in both magnetic resonance imaging and BRAF V600E mutant 
allele titers in her plasma. Given the good treatment response, liver 
transplantation was conducted. The postoperative course was uneventful, and 
chemotherapy was resumed 34 days after liver transplantation. Subsequent 
maintenance treatment was completed with no severe adverse effects. To prevent 
perioperative complications due to exacerbation of liver dysfunction and 
possible discontinuation of chemotherapy, liver transplantation should be 
considered before development of end-stage liver failure, provided that the 
original disease is well controlled.
