ATP-insensitive K(ATP) channel mutations cause neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM). 
To explore the mechanistic etiology, we generated transgenic mice carrying an 
ATP-insensitive mutant K(ATP) channel subunit. Constitutive expression in 
pancreatic beta cells caused neonatal hyperglycemia and progression to severe 
diabetes and growth retardation, with loss of islet insulin content and beta 
cell architecture. Tamoxifen-induced expression in adult beta cells led to 
diabetes within 2 weeks, with similar secondary consequences. Diabetes was 
prevented by transplantation of normal islets under the kidney capsule. 
Moreover, the endogenous islets maintained normal insulin content and secretion 
in response to sulfonylureas, but not glucose, consistent with reduced ATP 
sensitivity of beta cell K(ATP) channels. In NDM, transfer to sulfonylurea 
therapy is less effective in older patients. This may stem from poor glycemic 
control or lack of insulin because glibenclamide treatment prior to tamoxifen 
induction prevented diabetes and secondary complications in mice but failed to 
halt disease progression after diabetes had developed.
