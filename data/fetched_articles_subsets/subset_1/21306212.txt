Although the exact prevalence of antiplatelet resistance in ischemic stroke is 
not known, estimates about the two most widely used antiplatelet agents - 
aspirin and clopidogrel - suggest that the resistance rate is high, irrespective 
of the definition used and parameters measured. Inadequate antiplatelet 
responsiveness correlates with an increased risk of recurrent ischemic vascular 
events in patients with stroke and acute coronary syndrome. It is not currently 
known whether tailoring antiplatelet therapy based on platelet function test 
results translates into a more effective strategy to prevent secondary vascular 
events after stroke. Large-scale clinical trials using a universally accepted 
definition and standardized measurement techniques for antiplatelet resistance 
are needed to demonstrate whether a 'platelet-function test-guided antiplatelet 
treatment' strategy translates into improved stroke care. This article gives an 
overview of the clinical importance of laboratory antiplatelet resistance, 
describes the challenges for platelet-function test-guided antiplatelet 
treatment and discusses practical issues about the management of patients with 
aspirin and/or clopidogrel resistance.
