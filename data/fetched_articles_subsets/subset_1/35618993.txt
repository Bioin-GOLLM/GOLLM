BACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is 
increased after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Rat and clinical studies support, while 
mouse studies refute, a role for GLP-1R signaling after SG. Therefore, we 
developed a global GLP-1R knockout (KO) rat to test the hypothesis that a 
functional GLP-1R is critical to induce weight loss and metabolic disease 
improvement after SG.
METHODOLOGY: A 4 bp deletion was created in exon 2 of the GLP-1R gene on a Lewis 
strain background to create a global GLP-1R KO rat. KO and Lewis rats were 
placed on a high-fat or low-fat diet and phenotyped followed by SG or Sham 
surgery and assessed for the effect of GLP-1R KO on surgical and metabolic 
efficacy.
RESULTS: Loss of the GLP-1R created an obesity-prone rodent without changes in 
energy expenditure. Both male and female KO rats had significantly greater 
insulin concentrations after an oral glucose gavage, augmented by a high-fat 
diet, compared to Lewis rats despite similar glucose concentrations. GLP-1R KO 
caused hepatomegaly and increased triglyceride deposition compared to Lewis 
rats. We found no difference between SG GLP-1R KO and Lewis groups when 
considering efficacy on body weight, glucose tolerance, and a robustly preserved 
improvement in fatty liver disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss of the GLP-1R in rats resulted in increased adiposity, insulin 
resistance, and severe steatosis. A functional GLP-1R is not critical to the 
metabolic efficacy of SG in Lewis rats, similar to mouse studies, but 
importantly including steatosis, supporting a GLP-1R-independent mechanism for 
the improvement in fatty liver disease after SG.
