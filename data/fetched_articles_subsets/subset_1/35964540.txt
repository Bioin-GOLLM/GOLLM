A new induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line namely UOMi008-A was generated 
from a patient having a childhood onset of Hypophosphatasia (HPP). This patient 
has compound heterozygous mutations c.571G > A (p.Glu191Lys) and c.1001G > A 
(p.Gly334Asp) in the ALPL gene respectively. This iPSC line will be used for in 
vitro disease modeling, which will aid in delineating the underlying molecular 
mechanism involved in disease pathogenesis and provide plausible new therapeutic 
directions.
