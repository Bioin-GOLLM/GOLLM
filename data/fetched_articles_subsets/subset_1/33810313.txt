Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a congenital macrocytic anemia associated with 
ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency. Ribosomal dysfunction delays globin 
synthesis, resulting in excess toxic free heme in erythroid progenitors, early 
differentiation arrest, and pure red cell aplasia. In this study, DBA induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines were generated from blood mononuclear cells 
of DBA patients with inactivating mutations in RPS19 and subjected to 
hematopoietic differentiation to model disease phenotypes. In vitro 
differentiated hematopoietic cells were used to investigate whether eltrombopag, 
an FDA-approved mimetic of thrombopoietin with robust intracellular iron 
chelating properties, could rescue erythropoiesis in DBA by restricting the 
labile iron pool (LIP) derived from excessive free heme. DBA iPSCs exhibited 
RPS19 haploinsufficiency, reduction in the 40S/60S ribosomal subunit ratio and 
early erythroid differentiation arrest in the absence of eltrombopag, compared 
to control isogenic iPSCs established by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of the 
RPS19 point mutation. Notably, differentiation of DBA iPSCs in the presence of 
eltrombopag markedly improved erythroid maturation. Consistent with a molecular 
mechanism based on intracellular iron chelation, we observed that deferasirox, a 
clinically licensed iron chelator able to permeate into cells, also enhanced 
erythropoiesis in our DBA iPSC model. In contrast, erythroid maturation did not 
improve substantially in DBA iPSC differentiation cultures supplemented with 
deferoxamine, a clinically available iron chelator that poorly accesses LIP 
within cellular compartments. These findings identify eltrombopag as a promising 
new therapeutic to improve anemia in DBA.
