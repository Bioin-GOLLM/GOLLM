Fungal cell wall synthesis is achieved by a balance of glycosyltransferase, 
hydrolase and transglycosylase activities. Transglycosylases strengthen the cell 
wall by forming a rigid network of crosslinks through mechanisms that remain to 
be explored. Here we study the function of the Aspergillus fumigatus family of 
five Crh transglycosylases. Although crh genes are dispensable for cell 
viability, simultaneous deletion of all genes renders cells sensitive to cell 
wall interfering compounds. In vitro biochemical assays and localisation studies 
demonstrate that this family of enzymes functions redundantly as 
transglycosylases for both chitin-glucan and chitin-chitin cell wall crosslinks. 
To understand the molecular basis of this acceptor promiscuity, we solved the 
crystal structure of A. fumigatus Crh5 (AfCrh5) in complex with a 
chitooligosaccharide at the resolution of 2.8 Å, revealing an extensive 
elongated binding cleft for the donor (-4 to -1) substrate and a short acceptor 
(+1 to +2) binding site. Together with mutagenesis, the structure suggests a 
"hydrolysis product assisted" molecular mechanism favouring transglycosylation 
over hydrolysis.
