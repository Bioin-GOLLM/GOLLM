We aimed to explore triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) 
activation in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), the most frequent monogenic 
auto-inflammatory disease, through the measurement of its serum soluble form, 
named sTREM-1. Blood samples from patients with FMF according to Livneh criteria 
followed in the French FMF national center and carrying two pathogenic MEFV 
mutations were collected. Serum level of sTREM-1 was assessed using ELISA. 
Demographic data, presence of FMF attack, association with histologically proven 
AA amyloidosis, and blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A 
(SAA) protein, and creatinine were collected. TREM-1 was available in 56 
patients (33.9% male, mean age 43 yr); AA amyloidosis was associated in six 
patients (19.6% in FMF). Mean sTREM-1 level did not differ significantly between 
patients having an attack or not and there was also no significant correlation 
between the level of sTREM-1 and CRP and SAA protein. However, the mean rate of 
sTREM-1 was significantly higher among FMF patients with AA amyloidosis versus 
without, though the concomitant SAA protein level was normal. Serum level of 
sTREM-1 was higher in patients with amyloidosis even though the concomitant SAA 
protein level was normal. sTREM-1 plasma levels could be an accurate tool to 
specifically identify FMF patients with amyloidosis.
