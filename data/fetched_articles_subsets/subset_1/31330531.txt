The bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila creates an intracellular niche 
permissive for its replication by extensively modulating host-cell functions 
using hundreds of effector proteins delivered by its Dot/Icm secretion system1. 
Among these, members of the SidE family (SidEs) regulate several cellular 
processes through a unique phosphoribosyl ubiquitination mechanism that bypasses 
the canonical ubiquitination machinery2-4. The activity of SidEs is regulated by 
another Dot/Icm effector known as SidJ5; however, the mechanism of this 
regulation is not completely understood6,7. Here we demonstrate that SidJ 
inhibits the activity of SidEs by inducing the covalent attachment of glutamate 
moieties to SdeA-a member of the SidE family-at E860, one of the catalytic 
residues that is required for the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity involved 
in ubiquitin activation2. This inhibition by SidJ is spatially restricted in 
host cells because its activity requires the eukaryote-specific protein 
calmodulin (CaM). We solved a structure of SidJ-CaM in complex with AMP and 
found that the ATP used in this reaction is cleaved at the Î±-phosphate position 
by SidJ, which-in the absence of glutamate or modifiable SdeA-undergoes 
self-AMPylation. Our results reveal a mechanism of regulation in bacterial 
pathogenicity in which a glutamylation reaction that inhibits the activity of 
virulence factors is activated by host-factor-dependent acyl-adenylation.
