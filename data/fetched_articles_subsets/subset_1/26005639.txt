PURPOSE: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) encodes a cytokine protein, which causes 
inflammation, maintains immune homeostasis and plays an essential role in oral 
pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between IL-6 
(- 174 and - 572) G/C promoter gene polymorphisms and risk of OSCC among 
Indians.
METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphism in IL-6 genes was genotyped in OSCC 
patients and healthy controls by PCR-RFLP method. Genotype and allele 
frequencies were analyzed by chi-square test and strength of associations by 
odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Frequency distribution of IL-6 (- 174) G/C gene polymorphism was 
significantly associated with OSCC patients in comparison to healthy controls 
(OR: 0.541, CI: 0.356-0.822; p: 0.004. However, frequency of IL-6 (- 572) G/C 
gene polymorphism was not significantly associated with OSCC patients 
(p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The genotype GC and allele C of IL-6 (- 174) G/C gene polymorphism 
play a significant role in OSCC susceptibility.
