The exonic regions of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) gene were 
characterized from 101 patients with defined clinical and biochemical evidence 
for the adult onset form of CPT II deficiency and in 2 patients detected as 
newborns with abnormal acylcarnitine profiles. Twenty-seven disease-causing 
mutations within the CPT2 gene were identified in this cohort, 16 of which were 
novel. A total of 60 disease-causing mutations have been identified to date in 
CPT2 and 41 of these are predicted to produce amino acid substitution/deletions. 
The implications of these mutations are described in light of recent advances in 
our understanding of the molecular structure of members of the carnitine 
acyltransferase family.
