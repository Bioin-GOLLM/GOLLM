Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) leads to the dissociation of 
heterotrimeric G-proteins into Gα and Gβγ subunits, which go on to regulate 
various effectors involved in a panoply of cellular responses. During 
chemotaxis, Gβγ subunits regulate actin assembly and migration, but the 
protein(s) linking Gβγ to the actin cytoskeleton remains unknown. Here, we 
identified a Gβγ effector, ElmoE in Dictyostelium, and demonstrated that it is 
required for GPCR-mediated chemotaxis. Remarkably, ElmoE associates with Gβγ and 
Dock-like proteins to activate the small GTPase Rac, in a GPCR-dependent manner, 
and also associates with Arp2/3 complex and F-actin. Thus, ElmoE serves as a 
link between chemoattractant GPCRs, G-proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. The 
pathway, consisting of GPCR, Gβγ, Elmo/Dock, Rac, and Arp2/3, spatially guides 
the growth of dendritic actin networks in pseudopods of eukaryotic cells during 
chemotaxis.
