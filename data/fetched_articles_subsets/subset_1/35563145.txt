(1) Objective: Considering that current knowledge of mechanisms involved in the 
molecular pathogenesis of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is limited, we conducted 
a systematic review to evaluate cumulative data obtained by Proton Magnetic 
Resonance Spectroscopic (1H MRS) studies. (2) Methods: A computer-based 
literature search of Medline, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and ProQuest was performed. Only 
cross-sectional studies using 1H MRS techniques in participants with SAD and 
healthy controls (HCs) were selected. (3) Results: The search generated eight 
studies. The results indicated regional abnormalities in the 'fear 
neurocircuitry' in patients with SAD. The implicated regions included the 
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), insula, occipital cortex (OC), as well 
as the subcortical regions, including the thalamus, caudate, and the putamen. 
(4) Conclusions: The evidence derived from eight studies suggests that possible 
pathophysiological mechanisms of SAD include impairments in the integrity and 
function of neurons and glial cells, including disturbances in energy 
metabolism, maintenance of phospholipid membranes, dysregulations of second 
messenger systems, and excitatory/inhibitory neurocircuitry. Conducting more 
cross-sectional studies with larger sample sizes is warranted given the limited 
evidence in this area of research.

Conflict of interest statement: Bernard Le Foll has obtained funding from Pfizer 
(GRAND Awards, including salary support) for investigator-initiated projects. Le 
Foll has some in-kind donations of cannabis products from Aurora and medication 
donations from Pfizer and Bioprojet and was provided a coil for the TMS Study 
from Brainsway. Le Foll has obtained industry funding from Canopy (through 
research grants handled by CAMH and the University of Toronto), Bioprojet, ACS, 
and Alkermes. Moreover, Le Foll has received in-kind donations of nabiximols 
from GW Pharma for past studies funded by CIHR and NIH. He has been consultant 
for Shionogi and participated in an Advisory Board Meeting for Indivior. Bernard 
Le Foll is also supported by CAMH by a Clinician-Scientist Award from the 
Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Toronto, and he 
currently is Addiction Psychiatry Chair at the Department of Psychiatry of the 
University of Toronto. Furthermore, he is supported by the Waypoint Centre for 
Mental Health. There are no conflicts of interest related to current work.
