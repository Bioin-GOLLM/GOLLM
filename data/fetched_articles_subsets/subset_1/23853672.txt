This paper describes the biological functions of PTEN and the PTEN regulated 
signaling pathway in pancreatic β-cells. PTEN has been shown to regulate the 
regeneration of β-cells. We review the pathways that are controlled by PTEN 
signaling and their functions in β-cell regeneration. In particular, we describe 
the unique effect of Pten deletion in β-cells. Unlike its effect in other 
tissues, Pten deletion does not lead to tumor formation but does enhance β-cell 
proliferation and function. In addition to the literature review, we also report 
new results exploring PTEN loss in adult β-cells. We demonstrate that inducing 
PTEN loss in adult cells has the same regenerative effects previously found for 
prenatal deletion.
