BACKGROUND: Previous genome-wide association studies have identified a link 
between the rs13041247 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the chromosome 
20q12 locus and the development of the congenital malformation known as 
nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P). The present 
meta-analysis was therefore designed to formally assess the relationship between 
rs13041247 and NSCL/P.
METHODS: We searched Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, the China National 
Knowledge Internet (CNKI), and the China Wanfang database in order to identify 
relevant published through 25 June 2019. This allowed us to identify 13 studies 
incorporating 4914 patients and 5981 controls for whom rs13041247 genotyping had 
been conducted, with STATA 12.0 then being used to conduct a meta-analysis of 
these pooled results. The I2 statistic was used to compare heterogeneity among 
studies.
RESULTS: In total this analysis incorporated 13 case-control studies. No 
association between the rs13041247 polymorphism and NSCL/P risk was detected in 
individuals of Asian ethnicity (C vs T: OR = 0.847, 95% CI = 0.702-1.021; CC vs 
TT: OR = 0.725, 95% CI = 0.494-1.063; CC vs CT: OR = 0.837, 95% 
CI = 0.657-1.067; CT + TT vs CC: OR = 1.265, 95% CI = 0.951-1.684; CC + CT vs 
TT: OR = 0.805, 95% CI = 0.630-1.029) or Caucasian ethnicity (C vs T: 
OR = 0.936, 95% CI = 0.786-1.114; CC vs TT: OR = 0.988, 95% CI = 0.674-1.446; CC 
vs CT: OR = 1.197, 95% CI = 0.816-1.757; CT + TT vs CC: OR = 0.918, 95% 
CI = 0.639-1.318; CC + CT vs TT: OR = 0.855, 95% CI = 0.677-1.081). However, an 
overall analysis of all participants in these studies revealed the rs13041247 C 
allele, the CT genotype, and the CC + CT model to be linked to a reduced NSCL/P 
risk (C vs T: OR = 0.897, 95% CI: 0.723-1.114, P = 0.048; CT vs TT: OR = 0.839, 
95% CI: 0.734-0.959, P = 0.01; CC + CT vs TT: OR = 0.824, 95% CI: 0.701-0.968, 
P = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the rs13041247 SNP located at the 20q12 
chromosomal locus is associated with NSCL/P risk in an overall pooled study 
population, although this association was not significant in East Asian or 
Caucasian populations.
