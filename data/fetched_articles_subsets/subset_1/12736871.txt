Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common human joint disease, characterized by 
loss and/or remodeling of joint synovium, cartilage, and bone. Here, we describe 
a genomewide linkage analysis of patients with idiopathic hand OA who were 
carefully phenotyped for involvement of either or both the distal 
interphalangeal (DIP) joints and the first carpometacarpal (CMC1) joints. The 
best linkage peaks were on chromosomes 4q and 3p and on the short arm of 
chromosome 2. Genomewide significance was reached for a locus on chromosome 2 
for patients with affected CMC1 joints (LOD = 4.97); this locus was also 
significant for patients with OA in both CMC1 and DIP joints (LOD = 4.44). The 
peak LOD score at this locus coincides with a gene, MATN3, encoding the 
noncollagenous cartilage extracellular matrix protein, matrilin-3. Subsequent 
screening of the genomic sequence revealed a missense mutation, of a conserved 
amino acid codon, changing threonine to methionine in the epidermal growth 
factor-like domain in matrilin-3. The missense mutation cosegregates with hand 
OA in several families. The mutation frequency is slightly more than 2% in 
patients with hand OA in the Icelandic population and has a relative risk of 
2.1.
