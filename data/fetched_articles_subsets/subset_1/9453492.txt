BACKGROUND & AIMS: The identification of a candidate gene for hereditary 
hemochromatosis in 69%-100% of patients with hemochromatosis has resulted in a 
diagnostic genotypic test (C282Y). The aim of this study was to reassess the 
phenotypic diagnostic criteria for hemochromatosis in patients homozygous for 
the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene.
METHODS: Transferrin saturation, ferritin, hepatic iron index, and iron removed 
by venesection were studied in C282Y++ homozygotes and C282Y-- putative 
homozygotes.
RESULTS: Patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in 122 of 128 cases 
(95%). In C282Y homozygotes, the results were as follows: hepatic iron index, 
>1.9 in 91.3%; transferrin saturation, >55% in 90%; serum ferritin, >300 
microg/L in 96% of men and >200 microg/L in 97% of women; and iron removed, >5 g 
in 70% of men and 73% of women. There were four homozygotes for C282Y with no 
biochemical evidence of iron overload.
CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of the phenotypic tests in decreasing order was as 
follows: serum ferritin, hepatic iron index, transferrin saturation, and iron 
removed by venesection. Although the genetic test is useful in the diagnostic 
algorithm, this study has shown both iron-loaded patients without the mutation 
and homozygous patients without iron overload.
