A phenomenon of genetic compensation is commonly observed when an organism with 
a disease-bearing mutation shows incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype. 
Such incomplete phenotypic penetrance, or genetic compensation, is more commonly 
found in stable knockout models, rather than transient knockdown models. As 
such, these incidents present a challenge for the disease modeling field, 
although a deeper understanding of genetic compensation may also hold the key 
for novel therapeutic interventions. In our study we created a knockout model of 
slc25a46 gene, which is a recently discovered important player in mitochondrial 
dynamics, and deleterious mutations in which are known to cause peripheral 
neuropathy, optic atrophy and cerebellar ataxia. We report a case of genetic 
compensation in a stable slc25a46 homozygous zebrafish mutant (hereafter 
referred as "mutant"), in contrast to a penetrant disease phenotype in the first 
generation (F0) slc25a46 mosaic mutant (hereafter referred as "crispant"), 
generated with CRISPR/Cas-9 technology. We show that the crispant phenotype is 
specific and rescuable. By performing mRNA sequencing, we define significant 
changes in slc25a46 mutant's gene expression profile, which are largely absent 
in crispants. We find that among the most significantly altered mRNAs, anxa6 
gene stands out as a functionally relevant player in mitochondrial dynamics. We 
also find that our genetic compensation case does not arise from mechanisms 
driven by mutant mRNA decay. Our study contributes to the growing evidence of 
the genetic compensation phenomenon and presents novel insights about Slc25a46 
function. Furthermore, our study provides the evidence for the efficiency of F0 
CRISPR screens for disease candidate genes, which may be used to advance the 
field of functional genetics.
