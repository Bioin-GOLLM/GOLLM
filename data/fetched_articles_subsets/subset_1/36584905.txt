Bats remains as reservoirs for highly contagious and pathogenic viral families 
including the Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviruses, and Rhabdoviridae. 
Spill over of viral species (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV & SARS-CoV2) from bats (as a 
possible potential reservoirs) have recently caused worst outbreaks. Early 
detection of viral species of pandemic potential in bats is of great importance. 
We detected beta coronaviruses in the studied bats population (positive samples 
from Rousettus leschenaultia) and performed the evolutionary analysis, amino 
acid sequence alignment, and analysed the 3-Dimentional protein structure. We 
detected the coronaviruses for the first time in bats from Pakistan. Our 
analysis based on RdRp partial gene sequencing suggest that the studied viral 
strains are closely related to MERS-CoV-like viruses as they exhibit close 
structure similarities (with few substitutions) and also observed a substitution 
in highly conserved SDD in the palm subdomain of motif C to ADD, when compared 
with earlier reported viral strains. It could be concluded from our study that 
coronaviruses are circulating among the bat's population in Pakistan. Based on 
the current findings, we suggest large scale screening procedures of bat virome 
across the country to detect potential pathogenic viral species.
