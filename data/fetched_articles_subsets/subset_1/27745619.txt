Thrombophilia or hypercoagulable conditions can be thought of as either 
inherited or acquired. The inherited disorders include deficiencies of 
antithrombin, protein C, or protein S or the common disorders of factor V Leiden 
and prothrombin G20210A gene mutation. All these disorders are inherited as 
autosomal dominant and predispose individuals primarily to venous thrombosis. 
Acquired thrombophilic conditions are seen in individuals with cancer, 
phospholipid antibodies, and a whole host of other conditions that alter 
endothelial function, change blood levels of coagulant or anticoagulant 
proteins, activate platelets, or have other effects on coagulation proteins, 
platelet function, or the endothelium.
