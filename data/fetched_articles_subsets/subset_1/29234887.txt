Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and 
its pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. The majority of PD cases are 
sporadic but a number of genes are associated with familial PD. Sporadic and 
familial PD have many molecular and cellular features in common, suggesting some 
shared pathogenic mechanisms. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been 
derived from patients harboring a range of different mutations of PD-associated 
genes. PD patient-derived iPSCs have been differentiated into relevant cell 
types, in particular dopaminergic neurons and used as a model to study PD. In 
this review, we describe how iPSCs have been used to improve our understanding 
of the pathogenesis of PD. We describe what cellular and molecular phenotypes 
have been observed in neurons derived from iPSCs harboring known PD-associated 
mutations and what common pathways may be involved.
