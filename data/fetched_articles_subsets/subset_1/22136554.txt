populations.

Several polymorphisms in the complement components factor H and CFHR1 are 
associated with higher risk to develop atypical Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome 
(aHUS) in Caucasians. We have determined the prevalence of these polymorphisms 
in Tunisian controls by using genetic and immunological techniques. No 
differences in the frequency of the factor H risk alleles c.-331C>T, c.2089A>G 
or c.2881G>T between Tunisian and Caucasians were found. On the contrary, the 
analysis of CFHR1 polymorphism revealed a higher frequency of Tunisian 
individuals homozygous for the CFHR1*Del (deleted) allele, and of individuals 
presenting the CFHR1*A phenotype. These results suggest distinct contributions 
of factor H and CFHR1 polymorphisms to aHUS in Tunisian and Caucasian 
populations.
