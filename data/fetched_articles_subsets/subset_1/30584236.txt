Glibenclamide and glipizide show large substantial inter-individual variation in 
clinical efficacy, which may be resulted from the genetic differences of 
metabolic enzymes and transporters in individuals. This study purposed to 
investigate the effect of OATP1B3 and CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms on the 
transport and metabolism of glibenclamide and glipizide in human. An LC-MS 
method was used to determine the uptake of glibenclamide and glipizide in 
OATP1B3, OATP1B3 (344T > G) and OATP1B3 (699G > A)-HEK293T cells and their 
metabolism in CYP2C9*1, *2 and *3 recombinase system. Glibenclamide can be taken 
in OATP1B3 (wild-type), OATP1B3 (344T > G) and OATP1B3 (699G > A)-HEK293T cells 
with the Vmax values of 44.91 ± 7.97, 46.08 ± 8.69, and 37.31 ± 5.04 
pmol/min/mg, while glipizide was taken in with Vmax of 16.50 ± 3.64, 
16.87 ± 4.23, and 13.42 ± 2.79 pmol/min/mg, respectively. The internal clearance 
of glibenclamide and glipizide in OATP1B3 (699G > A) was less than that in 
wild-type. Glibenclamide can be metabolized in CYP2C9*1, *2 and *3 recombinase 
system with the Vmax values of 1.58 ± 0.71, 0.69 ± 0.25, and 0.41 ± 0.13 
nmol/min/mg protein, while glipizide was metabolized with Vmax of 8.82 ± 2.78, 
5.99 ± 1.95, and 2.87 ± 1.03 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The internal 
clearance of glibenclamide and glipizide in CYP2C9*2 and *3 was markedly reduced 
compared to that in CYP2C9*1. These results collectively demonstrate that 
OATP1B3 (699G > A) and CYP2C9*2 and *3 have a significant influence on the 
transport and metabolism of glibenclamide and glipizide.
