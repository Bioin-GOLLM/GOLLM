OBJECTIVES: Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and 3 (HER3) belong 
to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of transmembrane receptor 
tyrosine kinases. In this study, we assessed HER2/HER3 expression levels in 
specimens of epithelial ovarian cancer and determined their correlation with 
clinical features of ovarian cancer.
METHODS: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were prepared from paraffin blocks of 105 
ovarian tumour samples. HER2, HER3, PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, mTOR, p-mTOR, S6, and p-S6 
expression levels were investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). HER2 and 
HER3 amplifications were determined using in situ hybridization (ISH). The 
correlation between HER2/3 expression and disease outcome of the patients 
including surgical outcome, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) was analysed.
RESULTS: HER2 positivity was 3.8% by IHC and 5.7% by ISH, whereas that of HER3 
was 12.4% and 8.6%, respectively. HER2 status by either IHC or ISH was not 
related to PFS (p=0.128, 0.168, respectively) and OS (p=0.245, 0.164, 
respectively). However, the HER3 status determined using fluorescence ISH was 
associated with poor PFS (p=0.035 on log rank test), which was a significant 
risk factor even after adjusting other possible risk factors in multivariate 
analysis (hazard ratio=2.377 [1.18-7.49], p=0.021). Expressions of Akt, p-mTOR, 
and S6 were also related with poor progression (p=0.008, 0.049, 0.014, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: HER3 is possibly an independent marker for poor prognosis in 
individuals with ovarian cancer, as the HER3 signalling pathway is distinct from 
that of HER2. The possibility of targeted therapy for patients with HER3 
alteration in ovarian cancer should be evaluated.
