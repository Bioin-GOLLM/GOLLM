BACKGROUND: Chondrogenesis is the earliest stage of skeletal development and is 
a highly dynamic process, integrating the activities and functions of 
transcription factors, cell signaling molecules and extracellular matrix 
proteins. The molecular mechanisms underlying chondrogenesis have been 
extensively studied and multiple key regulators of this process have been 
identified. However, a genome-wide overview of the gene regulatory network in 
chondrogenesis has not been achieved.
RESULTS: In this study, employing RNA sequencing, we identified 332 protein 
coding genes and 34 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes that are highly 
selectively expressed in human fetal growth plate chondrocytes. Among the 
protein coding genes, 32 genes were associated with 62 distinct human skeletal 
disorders and 153 genes were associated with skeletal defects in knockout mice, 
confirming their essential roles in skeletal formation. These gene products 
formed a comprehensive physical interaction network and participated in multiple 
cellular processes regulating skeletal development. The data also revealed 34 
transcription factors and 11,334 distal enhancers that were uniquely active in 
chondrocytes, functioning as transcriptional regulators for the 
cartilage-selective genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed a complex gene regulatory network controlling 
skeletal development whereby transcription factors, enhancers and lncRNAs 
participate in chondrogenesis by transcriptional regulation of key genes. 
Additionally, the cartilage-selective genes represent candidate genes for 
unsolved human skeletal disorders.
