Cows produce antibodies with a disulfide-bonded antigen-binding domain embedded 
within ultralong heavy chain third complementarity determining regions. This 
"knob" domain is analogous to natural cysteine-rich peptides such as knottins in 
that it is small and stable but can accommodate diverse loops and disulfide 
bonding patterns. We immunized cattle with SARS-CoV-2 spike and found ultralong 
CDR H3 antibodies that could neutralize several viral variants at picomolar IC50 
potencies in vitro and could protect from disease in vivo. The independent CDR 
H3 peptide knobs were expressed and maintained the properties of the parent 
antibodies. The knob interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike was revealed by electron 
microscopy, X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry and 
established ultralong CDR H3-derived knobs as the smallest known recombinant 
independent antigen-binding fragment. Unlike other vertebrate antibody 
fragments, these knobs are not reliant on the immunoglobulin domain and have 
potential as a new class of therapeutics.
