BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is complex, 
involving metabolic and hemodynamic factors. Although DKD has been established 
as a heritable disorder and several genetic studies have been conducted, the 
identification of unique genetic variants for DKD is limited by its multiplex 
classification based on the phenotypes of diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). Thus, we aimed to identify the genetic variants related to 
DKD that differentiate it from type 2 DM and CKD.
METHODS: We conducted a large-scale genome-wide association study mega-analysis, 
combining Korean multi-cohorts using multinomial logistic regression. A total of 
33,879 patients were classified into four groups-normal, DM without CKD, CKD 
without DM, and DKD-and were further analyzed to identify novel 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with DKD. Additionally, 
fine-mapping analysis was conducted to investigate whether the variants of 
interest contribute to a trait. Conditional analyses adjusting for the effect of 
type 1 DM (T1D)-associated HLA variants were also performed to remove 
confounding factors of genetic association with T1D. Moreover, analysis of 
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) was performed using the 
Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
analyzed using the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE30529). The significant 
eQTL DEGs were used to explore the predicted interaction networks using search 
tools for the retrieval of interacting genes and proteins.
RESULTS: We identified three novel SNPs [rs3128852 (P = 8.21×10-25), rs117744700 
(P = 8.28×10-10), and rs28366355 (P = 2.04×10-8)] associated with DKD. Moreover, 
the fine-mapping study validated the causal relationship between rs3128852 and 
DKD. rs3128852 is an eQTL for TRIM27 in whole blood tissues and HLA-A in 
adipose-subcutaneous tissues. rs28366355 is an eQTL for HLA-group genes present 
in most tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully identified SNPs (rs3128852, rs117744700, and 
rs28366355) associated with DKD and verified the causal association between 
rs3128852 and DKD. According to the in silico analysis, TRIM27 and HLA-A can 
define DKD pathophysiology and are associated with immune response and 
autophagy. However, further research is necessary to understand the mechanism of 
immunity and autophagy in the pathophysiology of DKD and to prevent and treat 
DKD.
