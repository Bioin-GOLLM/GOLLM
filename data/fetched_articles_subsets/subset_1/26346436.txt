Simultaneous bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax is a very rare clinical event, 
comprising approximately 1% of all spontaneous pneumothoraces. Clinical signs 
and symptoms may vary from mild chest pain and dyspnea to severe respiratory 
failure; nevertheless immediate treatment is mandatory as this condition can 
deteriorate and progress to tension pneumothorax. An underlying lung disease has 
been commonly described; in most istances primary or secondary tumors, 
interstitial diseases, and infectious diseases. Birt-Hogg-Dubè syndrome is a 
rare inherited disorder clinically characterized by multiple fibrofolliculomas, 
renal tumors, lung cysts, and, in ~24% of the patients, occurrence of 
spontaneous pneumothorax. In this case, we firstly report the concurrence of 
these rare conditions, as a patient presenting a simultaneous bilateral 
spontaneous pneumothorax was diagnosed with Birt-Hogg-Dubè syndrome based on the 
typical radiological findings and genetic testing of the folliculin gene located 
on chromosome 17.
