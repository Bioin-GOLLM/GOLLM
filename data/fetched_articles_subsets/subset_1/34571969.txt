Melanoma develops as a result of several genetic alterations, with UV radiation 
often acting as a mutagenic risk factor. Deep knowledge of the molecular 
signaling pathways of different types of melanoma allows better characterization 
and provides tools for the development of therapies based on the intervention of 
signals promoted by these cascades. The latest World Health Organization 
classification acknowledged the specific genetic drivers leading to melanoma and 
classifies melanocytic lesions into nine distinct categories according to the 
associate cumulative sun damage (CSD), which correlates with the molecular 
alterations of tumors. The largest groups are melanomas associated with low-CSD 
or superficial spreading melanomas, characterized by frequent presentation of 
the BRAFV600 mutation. High-CSD melanomas include lentigo maligna type and 
desmoplastic melanomas, which often have a high mutation burden and can harbor 
NRAS, BRAFnon-V600E, or NF1 mutations. Non-CSD-associated melanomas encompass 
acral and mucosal melanomas that usually do not show BRAF, NRAS, or NF1 
mutations (triple wild-type), but in a subset may have KIT or SF3B1 mutations. 
To improve survival, these driver alterations can be treated with targeted 
therapy achieving significant antitumor activity. In recent years, relevant 
improvement in the prognosis and survival of patients with melanoma has been 
achieved, since the introduction of BRAF/MEK tyrosine kinase inhibitors and 
immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this review, we describe the current knowledge 
of molecular pathways and discuss current and potential therapeutic targets in 
melanoma, focusing on their clinical relevance of development.
