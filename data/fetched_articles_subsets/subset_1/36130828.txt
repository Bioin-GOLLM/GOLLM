Cross-recognized public TCRs against HIV epitopes have been proposed to be 
important for the control of AIDS disease progression and HIV variants. The 
overlapping Nef138-8 and Nef138-10 peptides from the HIV Nef protein are 
HLA-A24-restricted immunodominant T cell epitopes, and an HIV mutant strain with 
a Y139F substitution in Nef protein can result in immune escape and is 
widespread in Japan. Here, we identified a pair of public TCRs specific to the 
HLA-A24-restricted Nef-138-8 epitope using PBMCs from White and Japanese 
patients, respectively, namely TD08 and H25-11. The gene use of the variable 
domain for TD08 and H25-11 is TRAV8-3, TRAJ10 for the α-chain and TRBV7-9, 
TRBD1*01, TRBJ2-5 for the β-chain. Both TCRs can recognize wild-type and 
Y2F-mutated Nef138-8 epitopes. We further determined three complex structures, 
including TD08/HLA-A24-Nef138-8, H25-11/HLA-A24-Nef138-8, and 
TD08/HLA-A24-Nef138-8 (2F). Then, we revealed the molecular basis of the public 
TCR binding to the peptide HLA, which mostly relies on the interaction between 
the TCR and HLA and can tolerate the mutation in the Nef138-8 peptide. These 
findings promote the molecular understanding of T cell immunity against HIV 
epitopes and provide an important basis for the engineering of TCRs to develop T 
cell-based immunotherapy against HIV infection.
