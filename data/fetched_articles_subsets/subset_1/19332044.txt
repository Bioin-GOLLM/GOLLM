BACKGROUND: T cells play a critical role in alloimmune recognition and thus 
contribute to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse prevention in 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 
(CTLA-4) and inducible costimulator (ICOS) are costimulatory molecules of T cell 
activation and their genetic variations can affect the capacity of T cells to 
become activated or inactivated.
METHODS: We examined CTLA-4 (-318 C/T and +49 A/G) and ICOS (c.602 A/C and 
c.1624 C/T) genotypes in 123 patients with HSCT and their HLA-matched sibling 
donors, and then evaluated the impacts of the genetic polymorphisms on GVHD, 
disease relapse, and survival.
RESULTS: By multivariate analysis, the donor CTLA-4 -318 TT genotype increased 
the risk of disease relapse (Hazard ratio [HR]: 5.91, 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1.17-29.79, P=0.0313). Recipients who received a graft from a donor with 
ICOS c.602 CC genotype had worse disease-free survival (HR: 5.97, 95% CI: 
1.49-23.87, P=0.0115). Additionally, recipients with ICOS c.1624 TT genotype had 
worse overall survival (HR: 12.98, 95% CI: 2.58-65.35, P=0.0019). Nevertheless, 
CTLA-4 and ICOS genotypes were not associated with acute and chronic GVHD.
CONCLUSIONS: Both donor and recipient CTLA-4 and ICOS gene polymorphisms might 
be of importance for the outcome of allogeneic HSCT.
