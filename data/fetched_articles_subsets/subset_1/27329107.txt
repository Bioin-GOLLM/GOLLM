BACKGROUND: Misfolded α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates participate in the 
pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease. Whereas much is 
known about how the various domains within full-length α-Syn (FL-α-Syn) 
contribute to the formation of α-Syn aggregates and therefore to their 
neurotoxicity, little is known about whether the individual peptides that can be 
generated from α-syn, possibly as intermediate metabolites during degradation of 
misfolded α-Syn aggregates, are neurotoxic themselves.
METHODS: A series of synthesized α-Syn peptides, corresponding to the locus in 
FL-α-Syn containing alanine 30, substitution of which with a proline causes a 
familial form of Parkinson's disease, were examined for their capacity of 
inducing release of microglial superoxide. The neurotoxicity of these peptides 
was measured according to their influence on the ability of neuroglial cultures 
deficient in gp91 (phox) , the catalytic unit of NADPH oxidase (Nox2), or 
wild-type cultures to take up (3)H-labeled dopamine and on the number of 
tyrosine hydroxylase-staining-positive neurons. Western blots and confocal 
images were utilized to analyze membrane translocation of p47 (phox) and p67 
(phox) , phosphorylation of p47 (phox) and Erk1/2 kinase, and binding of α-Syn 
peptides to gp91 (phox) . Activation of brain microglia in mice injected with 
α-Syn peptides was demonstrated by immunostaining for major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC)-II along with qPCR for Iba-1 and MHC-II.
RESULTS: We report α-Syn (29-40) as a specific peptide capable of activating 
microglial Nox2 to produce superoxide and cause dopaminergic neuronal damage. 
Administered to mice, this peptide also activated brain microglia to increase 
expression of MHC-II and Iba-1 and stimulated oxidation reaction. Exploring the 
underlying mechanisms showed that α-Syn (29-40) peptide triggered Nox2 to 
generate extracellular superoxide and its metabolite H2O2 by binding to the 
catalytic unit gp91 (phox) of Nox2; diffusing into cytosol, H2O2 activated 
Erk1/2 kinase to phosphorylate p47 (phox) and p67 (phox) and further activated 
Nox2, establishing a positive feedback loop to amplify the Nox2-mediated 
response.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study suggests novel information regarding how 
α-Syn causes neuronal injury, possibly including mechanisms involving abnormal 
metabolites of α-Syn aggregates.
