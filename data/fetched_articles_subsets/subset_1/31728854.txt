BACKGROUND: Ependymoma (EPN) is the third most common childhood cancer of the 
central nervous system. RELA fusion-positive EPN accounts for approximately 70% 
of all childhood supratentorial tumors and shows the worst prognosis among the 
supratentorial EPNs. TP53 mutation is infrequent in RELA fusions EPNs. In the 
population from the Southern region of Brazil, there is a high incidence of the 
germline TP53 p.R337H mutation that predisposes carriers to develop early-onset 
tumors. However, despite this high incidence, the frequency of this mutation 
among EPN patients remains to be determined. Here, we investigated the presence 
of the TP53 p.R337H mutation in a larger cohort of pediatric EPNs of three 
institutions located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.
METHODS: The TP53 p.R337H mutation was screened by conventional RT-PCR and 
Sanger sequencing in 49 pediatric EPNs diagnosed during the period from 1995 to 
2016.
RESULTS: We described for the first time a case of a 5-year-old girl with RELA 
fusion EPN with a heterozygous TP53 p.R337H mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: The present finding indicates that the TP53 p.R337H germline 
mutation is uncommon in patients with EPN in Brazil and screening of pediatric 
patients RELA fusion EPN may be informative to better understand the role of 
TP53 germline mutations in the development and prognosis of these tumors.
