Effective network analysis of protein data requires high-quality proteomic 
datasets. Here, we report a near doubling in coverage of the C. elegans adult 
proteome, identifying >11,000 proteins in total with ∼9,400 proteins 
reproducibly detected in three biological replicates. Using quantitative mass 
spectrometry, we identify proteins whose abundances vary with age, revealing a 
concerted downregulation of proteins involved in specific metabolic pathways and 
upregulation of cellular stress responses with advancing age. Among these are 
∼30 peroxisomal proteins, including the PRX-5/PEX5 import protein. Functional 
experiments confirm that protein import into the peroxisome is compromised 
in vivo in old animals. We also studied the behavior of the set of age-variant 
proteins in chronologically age-matched, long-lived daf-2 insulin/IGF-1-pathway 
mutants. Unexpectedly, the levels of many of these age-variant proteins did not 
scale with extended lifespan. This indicates that, despite their youthful 
appearance and extended lifespans, not all aspects of aging are reset in these 
long-lived mutants.
