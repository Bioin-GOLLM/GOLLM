BACKGROUND: One-third of cancers activate endogenous synthesis of 
serine/glycine, and can become addicted to this pathway to sustain proliferation 
and survival. Mechanisms driving this metabolic rewiring remain largely unknown.
METHODS: NKX2-1 overexpressing and NKX2-1 knockdown/knockout T-cell leukaemia 
and lung cancer cell line models were established to study metabolic rewiring 
using ChIP-qPCR, immunoblotting, mass spectrometry, and proliferation and 
invasion assays. Findings and therapeutic relevance were validated in mouse 
models and confirmed in patient datasets.
RESULTS: Exploring T-cell leukaemia, lung cancer and neuroendocrine prostate 
cancer patient datasets highlighted the transcription factor NKX2-1 as putative 
driver of serine/glycine metabolism. We demonstrate that transcription factor 
NKX2-1 binds and transcriptionally upregulates serine/glycine synthesis enzyme 
genes, enabling NKX2-1 expressing cells to proliferate and invade in 
serine/glycine-depleted conditions. NKX2-1 driven serine/glycine synthesis 
generates nucleotides and redox molecules, and is associated with an altered 
cellular lipidome and methylome. Accordingly, NKX2-1 tumour-bearing mice display 
enhanced tumour aggressiveness associated with systemic metabolic rewiring. 
Therapeutically, NKX2-1-expressing cancer cells are more sensitive to 
serine/glycine conversion inhibition by repurposed anti-depressant sertraline, 
and to etoposide chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, we identify NKX2-1 as a novel transcriptional 
regulator of serine/glycine synthesis addiction across cancers, revealing a 
therapeutic vulnerability of NKX2-1-driven cancers. Transcription factor NKX2-1 
fuels cancer cell proliferation and survival by hyperactivating serine/glycine 
synthesis, highlighting this pathway as a novel therapeutic target in 
NKX2-1-positive cancers.
