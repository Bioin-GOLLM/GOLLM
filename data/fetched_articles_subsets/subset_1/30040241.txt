Given the crucial role of DNA damage in human health and disease, it is 
important to be able to accurately measure both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA 
damage. This article describes a method based on a long-amplicon quantitative 
PCR-based assay that does not require a separate mitochondrial isolation step, 
which can often be labor-intensive and generate artifacts. The detailed basic 
protocol presented here is newly revised, with particular attention to 
application in Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, and Caenorhabditis elegans 
resulting from changes in availability of PCR reagents. Optimized extraction 
support protocols are also described for high-quality DNA from multiple rat 
tissues for which these procedures had not previously been described. © 2018 by
