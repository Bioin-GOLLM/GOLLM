BACKGROUND: Zebrafish have been used as a vertebrate model to study human 
cancers such as melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liver cancer, and leukemia as well 
as for high-throughput screening of small molecules of therapeutic value. 
However, they are just emerging as a model for human brain tumors, which are 
among the most devastating and difficult to treat. In this study, we evaluated 
zebrafish as a brain tumor model by overexpressing a human version of oncogenic 
KRAS (KRAS(G12V)).
METHODS: Using zebrafish cytokeratin 5 (krt5) and glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (gfap) gene promoters, we activated Ras signaling in the zebrafish 
central nervous system (CNS) through transient and stable transgenic 
overexpression. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to identify 
activated pathways in the resulting brain tumors. The effects of the MEK 
inhibitor U0126 on oncogenic KRAS were evaluated.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that transient transgenic expression of KRAS(G12V) in 
putative neural stem and/or progenitor cells induced brain tumorigenesis. When 
expressed under the control of the krt5 gene promoter, KRAS(G12V) induced brain 
tumors in ventricular zones (VZ) at low frequency. The majority of other tumors 
were composed mostly of spindle and epithelioid cells, reminiscent of malignant 
peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). In contrast, when expressed under the 
control of the gfap gene promoter, KRAS(G12V) induced brain tumors in both VZs 
and brain parenchyma at higher frequency. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated 
prominent activation of the canonical RAS-RAF-ERK pathway, variable activation 
of the mTOR pathway, but no activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. In a 
krt5-derived stable and inducible transgenic line, expression of oncogenic KRAS 
resulted in skin hyperplasia, and the MEK inhibitor U0126 effectively suppressed 
this pro-proliferative effects. In a gfap-derived stable and inducible line, 
expression of oncogenic KRAS led to significantly increased mitotic index in the 
spinal cord.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that zebrafish could be explored to study 
cellular origins and molecular mechanisms of brain tumorigenesis and could also 
be used as a platform for studying human oncogene function and for discovering 
oncogenic RAS inhibitors.
