Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) is a voltage- and Ca2+-gated ATP 
channel that plays an important role in neuronal signaling. However, as the 
previously reported CALHM structures are all in the ATP-conducting state, the 
gating mechanism of ATP permeation is still elusive. Here, we report cryo-EM 
reconstructions of two Danio rerio CALHM1 heptamers with ordered or flexible 
long C-terminal helices at resolutions of 3.2 Å and 2.9 Å, respectively, and one 
D. rerio CALHM1 octamer with flexible long C-terminal helices at a resolution of 
3.5 Å. Structural analysis shows that the heptameric CALHM1s are in an 
ATP-nonconducting state with a central pore diameter of approximately 6.6 Å. 
Compared with those inside the octameric CALHM1, the N-helix inside the 
heptameric CALHM1 is in the "down" position to avoid steric clashing with the 
adjacent TM1 helix. Molecular dynamics simulations show that as the N-helix 
moves from the "down" position to the "up" position, the pore size of ATP 
molecule permeation increases significantly. Our results provide important 
information for elucidating the mechanism of ATP molecule permeation in the 
CALHM1 channel.
