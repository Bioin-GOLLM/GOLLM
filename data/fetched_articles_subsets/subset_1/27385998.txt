BACKGROUND: Tooth restoration immediately after bleaching is challenging due to 
the potential problems in achieving adequate bond strength.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of surface treatment 
with ER:YAG, ND:YAG, CO2 lasers and 10% sodium ascorbate solution on immediate 
microtensile bond strength of composite resin to recently bleached enamel.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Ninety sound molar teeth were randomly divided into three 
main groups (n:30) : NB (without bleaching), HB (bleached with 38% carbamide 
peroxide) and OB (bleached with Heydent bleaching gel assisted by diode laser). 
Each group was divided into five subgroups (n:6) : Si (without surface 
treatment), Er (Er:YAG laser), CO2 (CO2 laser), Nd (Nd:YAG laser) and As 
(Immersion in 10% sodium ascorbate solution). The bonding system was then 
applied and composite build-ups were constructed. The teeth were sectioned by 
low speed saw to obtain enamel- resin sticks and submitted to microtensile bond 
testing. Statistical analyses were done using two- way ANOVA, Tukey and Tamhane 
tests.
RESULTS: µTBS of bleached teeth irradiated with ND:YAG laser was not 
significantly different from NB-Nd group. Microtensile bond strength of OB-Er 
group was higher than NB-Er and HB-Er groups. The mean µTBS of HB-CO2 group was 
higher than NB-CO2 group; the average µTBS of HB-As and OB-As groups was also 
higher than NB-As group.
CONCLUSION: Use of Nd:YAG, CO2 lasers and 10% sodium ascorbate solution could 
improve the bond strength in home-bleached specimens. Application of ND:YAG 
laser on nonbleached specimens and Er:YAG laser on office-bleached specimens led 
to the highest µTBS in comparison to other surface treatments in each main 
group.
