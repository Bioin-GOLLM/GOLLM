Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic cancer (PC) belong to the most 
lethal malignancies worldwide. Despite advances in surgical techniques and 
perioperative multidisciplinary management, the prognosis of both carcinoma 
entities remains poor mainly because of rapid tumor progression and early 
dissemination with diagnosis in advanced tumor stages with poor sensitivity to 
current therapy regimens. Both highly heterogeneous visceral carcinomas exhibit 
unique somatic alterations, but share common driver genes and mutations as well. 
Recently, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) could be identified as a liquid biopsy 
tool with huge potential as non-invasive biomarker in early diagnosis and 
prognosis. CtDNA released from necrotic or apoptotic cells of primary tumors, 
metastasis, and circulating tumor cells can reveal genetic and epigenetic 
alterations with tumor-specific and individual mutation and methylation 
profiles. In this article, we focus on clinical impact of ctDNA as potential 
biomarker in patients with HCC and PC.
