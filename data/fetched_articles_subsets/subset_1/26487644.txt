BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that potentially play a 
critical role in tumorigenesis. Mounting evidence indicates that one specific 
miRNA: miR-320b is down regulated in numerous human cancers, including 
colorectal cancer (CRC); making the hypothesis that miR-320b may play a key role 
in tumorigenesis plausible. However, its role in carcinogenesis remains poorly 
defined. The goal of this study is to better clarify the role of miR-320b in 
tumor growth of CRC.
METHODS: Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
was conducted to detect the expression of miR-320b in CRC tissues and 5 CRC cell 
lines. The effect of miR-320b on cell proliferation was analyzed in vitro and in 
vivo. Furthermore, a luciferase reporter assay was performed to measure the 
target effects of miR-320b. Lastly, the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels 
of the gene c-MYC were measured in CRC cell lines and tissues by qRT-PCR, and 
confirmed via Western blot and Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.
RESULTS: The results presented here showed that miR-320b expression was down 
regulated in both CRC tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-320b in CRC cells 
was statistically correlated with a decrease of cell growth in vitro and in 
vivo, while c-MYC was identified as a target gene of miR-320b in CRC. 
Furthermore, it was found that up-regulation of c-Myc can attenuate the effects 
induced by miR-320b.
CONCLUSIONS: Our identification of c-MYC as a target gene of miR-320b provides 
new insights into the pathophysiology of CRC proliferation, and identifies 
miR-320b as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CRC.
