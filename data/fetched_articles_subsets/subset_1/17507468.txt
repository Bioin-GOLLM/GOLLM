HLA-B*5703 is associated with effective immune control in human immunodeficiency 
virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Here we describe an escape mutation within the 
immunodominant HLA-B*5703-restricted epitope in chronic HIV-1 infection, 
KAFSPEVIPMF (Gag 162-172), and demonstrate that this mutation reduces viral 
replicative capacity. Reversion of this mutation following transmission to 
HLA-B*5703-negative recipients was delayed by the compensatory mutation S165N 
within the same epitope. These data may help explain the observed association 
between HLA-B*5703 and long-term control of viremia.
