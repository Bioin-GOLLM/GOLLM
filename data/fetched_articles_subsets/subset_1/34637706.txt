Inter-areal coherence between field potentials is a widespread phenomenon in 
cortex. Coherence has been hypothesized to reflect phase-synchronization between 
oscillators and flexibly gate communication according to behavioral and 
cognitive demands. We reveal an alternative mechanism where coherence is not the 
cause but the consequence of communication and naturally emerges because spiking 
activity in a sending area causes post-synaptic potentials both in the same and 
in other areas. Consequently, coherence depends in a lawful manner on power and 
phase-locking in the sender and connectivity. Changes in oscillatory power 
explained prominent changes in fronto-parietal and LGN-V1 coherence across 
behavioral conditions. Optogenetic experiments and excitatory-inhibitory network 
simulations identified afferent synaptic inputs rather than spiking entrainment 
as the principal determinant of coherence. These findings suggest that unique 
spectral profiles of different brain areas automatically give rise to 
large-scale coherence patterns that follow anatomical connectivity and 
continuously reconfigure as a function of behavior and cognition.
