We describe a 2-year-old Japanese boy with radiolucent urolithiasis and 
recurrent urinary tract infection. Urinalysis showed typical 
2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA) crystals, leading to a diagnosis as adenine 
phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency. The sensitivity of proliferating T 
cells to an adenine analogue, whose cytotoxicity is dependent on APRT, showed 
that he was homozygous or compound heterozygous for the APRT gene mutation. A 
genetic analysis revealed a compound heterozygous state for M136T and a novel 
missense mutation L33P, not previously reported in patients with APRT 
deficiency.
CONCLUSION: Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency should be suspected in 
all patients with radiolucent kidney stones, urinary 2,8-DHA crystals were an 
important finding for an early diagnosis of APRT deficiency. Appropriate 
treatment should be initiated to prevent the development of urolithiasis or 
renal failure in APRT-deficient children. The T cell method was useful to detect 
a homozygote or a compound heterozygote of the pathogenic allelic gene in APRT 
deficiency, and a genetic analysis revealed a novel mutation L33P.
