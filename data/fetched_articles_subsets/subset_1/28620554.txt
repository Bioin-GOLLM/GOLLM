We present the clinical phenotype of a toddler who presented with vitamin 
D-resistant rickets, with one of the highest initial levels of alkaline 
phosphatase and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels reported in the literature. The 
toddler had novel compound heterozygous mutations in the ligand-binding site of 
the vitamin D receptor and had an excellent response to calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D).
