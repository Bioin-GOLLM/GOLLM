Ellis-van Creveld (EvC) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive malformation 
syndrome with the main features cardiac defects, postaxial hexadactyly, 
mesomelic shortening of the limbs, short ribs, dysplastic nails and teeth, oral 
frenula and various other abnormalities while mental function is normal. We 
describe 2 adult EvC patients with the cardinal skeletal features of mesomelic 
short stature and severe, progressive genu valgum deformity, resulting from loss 
of function mutations in the EVC genes. While the genu valgum was the 
predominating and disabling feature in patient 1, patient 2 showed 
acroosteolyses in the distal phalanges and a symmetrical synostosis of 
metacarpals in his hands. Moreover, patient 2 developed synostoses in the 
additional fingers in adolescence which had not been present at the age of 12 
years, suggesting a further progression of skeletal disease. Joint fusion of 
phalanges so far has not been reported in EvC syndrome. Our data further expand 
the phenotypic spectrum of EvC related skeletal malformations and contribute 
important new information on the clinical course of EvC syndrome with increasing 
age.
