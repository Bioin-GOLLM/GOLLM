The adaptor CARD9 functions downstream of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) for the 
sensing of microbial infection, which leads to responses by the TH1 and TH17 
subsets of helper T cells. The single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4077515 at CARD9 
in the human genome, which results in the substitution S12N (CARD9S12N), is 
associated with several autoimmune diseases. However, the function of CARD9S12N 
has remained unknown. Here we generated CARD9S12N knock-in mice and found that 
CARD9S12N facilitated the induction of type 2 immune responses after engagement 
of CLRs. Mechanistically, CARD9S12N mediated CLR-induced activation of the 
non-canonical transcription factor NF-ÎºB subunit RelB, which initiated 
production of the cytokine IL-5 in alveolar macrophages for the recruitment of 
eosinophils to drive TH2 cell-mediated allergic responses. We identified the 
homozygous CARD9 mutation encoding S12N in patients with allergic 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and revealed activation of RelB and production of 
IL-5 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these patients. Our study 
provides genetic and functional evidence demonstrating that CARD9S12N can turn 
alveolar macrophages into IL-5-producing cells and facilitates TH2 cell-mediated 
pathologic responses.
