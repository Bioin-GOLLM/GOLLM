The purpose of this study was to develop the pathway of silk fibroin (SF) 
biopolymer surface induced cell membrane protein activation. Fibroblasts were 
used as an experimental model to evaluate the responses of cellular proteins 
induced by biopolymer material using a mass spectrometry-based profiling system. 
The surface was covered by multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and SF to 
increase the surface area, enhance the adhesion of biopolymer, and promote the 
rate of cell proliferation. The amount of adhered fibroblasts on CNTs/SF 
electrodes of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) greatly exceeded those on other 
surfaces. Moreover, analyzing differential protein expressions of adhered 
fibroblasts on the biopolymer surface by proteomic approaches indicated that 
CD44 may be a key protein. Through this study, utilization of mass 
spectrometry-based proteomics in evaluation of cell adhesion on biopolymer was 
proposed.
