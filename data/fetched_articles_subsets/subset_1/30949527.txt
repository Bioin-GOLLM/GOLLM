BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is currently classified into 8 genotypes and 
86 subtypes. The objective of this study was to characterize novel HCV subtypes 
and to investigate the impact of subtypes on treatment outcome.
METHODS: Full-genome sequencing was performed on HCV plasma samples with <85% 
sequence homology of NS3, NS5A, and/or NS5B to HCV genotype (GT) 1-8 reference 
strains.
RESULTS: A total of 14 653 patients with GT1-6 HCV infection were enrolled in 
clinical studies of sofosbuvir-based regimens. For the majority of the patients, 
a specific subtype could be assigned based on a close genetic relationship to 
previously described subtypes. However, for 19 patients, novel subtypes were 
identified with <85% homology compared with previously described subtypes. These 
novel subtypes had the following genotypes: 9 in GT2, 5 in GT4, 2 in GT6, and 1 
each in GT1, GT3, and GT5. Despite the presence of polymorphisms at 
resistance-associated substitution positions, 18 of the 19 patients treated with 
sofosbuvir-containing therapy achieved SVR12.
CONCLUSIONS: Nineteen novel HCV subtypes were identified, suggesting an even 
greater genetic diversity of HCV subtypes than previously recognized.
