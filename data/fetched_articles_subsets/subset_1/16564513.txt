OBJECTIVE: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited disorder of ventricular 
repolarization caused by mutations in cardiac ion channel genes, including 
KCNQ1. In this study the electrophysiological properties of a LQTS-associated 
mutation in KCNQ1 (Q357R) were characterized. This mutation is located near the 
C-terminus of S6, a region that is important for the gate structure.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Co-assembly of KCNE1 with the mutant Q357R elicited a 
current displaying slower activation compared to the wild-type KCNQ1/KCNE1 
channels. The voltage dependence of activation of Q357R was shifted to more 
positive potentials. Moreover, a strong reduction in current density was 
observed that was partially attributed to the altered voltage dependence and 
kinetics of activation. The reduced current amplitude was also caused by 
intracellular retention of Q357R/KCNE1 channels as was shown by confocal 
microscopy. It indicated that the Q357R mutation disturbed protein expression by 
a trafficking or assembly problem of the Q357R/KCNE1 complex. To mimic the 
patient status KCNQ1, Q357R and KCNE1 were co-expressed, which revealed a 
dominant negative effect on current density and activation kinetics.
CONCLUSION: The effects of the Q357R mutation on the activation of the channel 
together with a reduced expression at the membrane would lead to a reduction in 
I(Ks) and thus in "repolarization reserve" under physiological circumstances. As 
such it explains the long QT syndrome observed in these patients.
