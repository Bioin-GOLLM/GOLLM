Post-transcriptional regulation of messenger RNA contributes to numerous aspects 
of gene expression. The key component to this level of regulation is the 
interaction of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their associated target mRNA. 
Splicing, stability, localization, translational efficiency, and alternate codon 
use are just some of the post-transcriptional processes regulated by RBPs. 
Central to our understanding of these processes is the need to characterize the 
network of RBP-mRNA associations and create a map of this functional 
post-transcriptional regulatory system. Here we provide a detailed methodology 
for mRNA isolation using RBP immunoprecipitation (RIP) as a primary partitioning 
approach followed by microarray (Chip) or next generation sequencing (NGS) 
analysis. We do this by using specific antibodies to target RBPs for the capture 
of associated RNA cargo. RIP-Chip/Seq has proven to be is a versatile, genomic 
technique that has been widely used to study endogenous RBP-RNA associations.
