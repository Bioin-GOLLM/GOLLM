Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase catalyzes the formation of 
5-methyltetrahydrofolate from 5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate and produces folate 
for the methylation of homocysteine to methionine. Due to insufficient 
conversion of homocysteine to methionine, plasma homocysteine levels increase in 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. Homocysteine is an amino acid 
that contains a neurotoxic sulfur molecule and can induce neuronal apoptosis. 
Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency is 1 of the etiological factors 
that causes neurological symptoms and signs in the newborn and childhood period. 
Here, we report a premature baby with prenatal onset diffuse multicystic 
encephalomalacia and cerebellar atrophy due to homozygous 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation.
