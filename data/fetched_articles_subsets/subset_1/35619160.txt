BACKGROUND: Endurance exercise training promotes the catabolism of 
branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in skeletal muscles. We have previously shown 
that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups J and K are markers of low responders 
in endurance training. In this paper, we hypothesize that BCAA catabolism is a 
surrogate marker of lower respiratory chain activity attributed to these 
haplogroups. We evaluated whether exercise-induced changes in amino acid 
concentrations differ between subjects harbouring mtDNA haplogroups J or K and 
those with non-JK haplogroups.
METHODS: Finnish male conscripts (N = 633) undertook the 12-min Cooper running 
test at the beginning and end of their military service. The intervention during 
the service mainly included endurance aerobic exercise and sports-related muscle 
training. Concentrations of seven amino acids were analysed in the serum using a 
high-throughput 1H NMR metabolomics platform. Total DNA was extracted from whole 
blood, and restriction fragment analysis was used to determine mtDNA haplogroups 
J and K.
RESULTS: The concentrations of the seven amino acids were higher following the 
intervention, with the exception of phenylalanine; interestingly, the increase 
in the concentrations of three BCAAs was larger in subjects with haplogroup J or 
K than in subjects with non-JK haplogroups (p = 0.029). MtDNA haplogroups J and 
K share two common nonsynonymous variants. Structural analysis based on 
crystallographic data on bovine complexes I and III revealed that the Leu18 
variant in cytochrome b encoded by m.14798T > C may interfere with ubiquinone 
binding at the Qi site in complex III.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the concentrations of serum BCAAs following 
exercise intervention differs between subjects harbouring mtDNA haplogroup J or 
K and those harbouring non-JK haplogroups. Lower response in endurance training 
and difference in exercise-induced increase in the concentrations of serum BCAAs 
suggest decreased respiratory chain activity. Haplogroups J and K share 
m.14798T > C in MT-CYB, which may hamper the function of complex III.
