Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA-4) plays an important role in 
downregulating T cell activation and proliferation. The CTLA-4 + 49G > A 
polymorphism is one of the most commonly studied polymorphisms in this gene due 
to its association with many cancer types, but the association between 
CTLA-4 + 49G > A polymorphism and digestive system cancer risks remain 
inconclusive. An updated meta-analysis based on 17 independent case-control 
studies consisting of 5176 cancer patients and 6747 controls was performed to 
address this association. Overall, there was no statistically increased risk of 
digestive system cancers in every genetic comparison. In subgroup analysis, this 
polymorphism was significantly linked to higher risks for pancreatic cancer (GG 
vs. AA, OR = 1.976, 95% CI = 1.496-2.611; GA vs. AA, OR = 1.433, 95% CI 
= 1.093-1.879; GG/GA vs. AA, OR = 1.668, 95% CI = 1.286-2.164; GG vs. GA/AA, 
OR = 1.502, 95% CI = 1.098-2.054; G vs. A, OR = 1.394, 95% CI = 1.098-1.770). We 
also observed increased susceptibility of hepatocellular cell carcinoma in 
homozygote comparison (OR = 1.433, 95% CI = 1.100-1.866) and dominant model 
(OR = 1.360, 95% CI = 1.059-1.746). According to the source of controls, 
significant effects were only observed in hospital-based studies (GA/AA vs. GG, 
OR = 1.257, 95% CI = 1.129-1.399). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, no 
significantly increased risks were found in either Asian or Caucasian. Our 
findings suggest that the CTLA-4 + 49G > A polymorphism may be associated with 
the risk of pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular cell carcinoma.
