Three protein factors IF1, IF2 and IF3 are involved in the initiation of 
translation in prokaryotes. No clear function has been assigned to the smallest 
of these three factors, IF1. Therefore, to investigate the role of this protein 
in the initiation process in Escherichia coli we have mutated the corresponding 
gene infA. Because IF1 is essential for cell viability and no mutant selection 
has so far been described, the infA gene in a plasmid was mutated by 
site-directed mutagenesis in a strain with a chromosomal infA+ gene, followed by 
deletion of this infA+ gene. Using this approach, the six arginine residues of 
IF1 were altered to leucine or aspartate. Another set of plasmid-encoded IF1 
mutants with a cold-sensitive phenotype was collected using localized random 
mutagenesis. All mutants with a mutated infA gene on a plasmid and a deletion of 
the chromosomal infA copy were viable, except for an R65D alteration. 
Differences in growth phenotypes of the mutants were observed in both minimal 
and rich media. Some of the mutated infA genes were successfully recombined into 
the chromosome thereby replacing the wild-type infA+ allele. Several of these 
recombinants showed reduced growth rate and a partial cold-sensitive phenotype. 
This paper presents a collection of IF1 mutants designed for in vivo and in 
vitro studies on the function of IF1.
