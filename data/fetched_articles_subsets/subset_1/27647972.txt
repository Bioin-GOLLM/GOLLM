OBJECTIVE: The inhibition of the neovascularization in tumors is a potential 
therapeutic target of cancer. Vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (VEGI) is a 
member of the TNF superfamily which has the ability to suppress the formation of 
new vessels in tumors. In order to study the association between VEGI gene 
polymorphisms and breast cancer risk, a case-control study was conducted in 
Chinese Han women in Northeast China.
METHODS: Our study involved 708 female breast cancer patients and 685 healthy 
volunteers. Four SNPs of VEGI gene were analyzed through the polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The 
association between VEGI gene polymorphisms and breast cancer risk was analyzed 
in our study. The relation between VEGI gene variants and clinical features of 
breast cancer including lymph node (LN) metastasis, estrogen receptor (ER), 
progestrogen receptor (PR), tumor protein 53 (p53), human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (Her-2) and triple negative (ER-/PR-/Her-2-) status was 
analyzed as well.
RESULTS: We found that the CT genotype and T allele of rs6478106 were more 
frequent in patients than in controls. There was also a statistical difference 
in the distribution of Crs6478106Grs4263839 haplotype between patients and 
controls. In addition, SNP rs6478106 and rs4979462 were related with the Her-2 
status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that VEGI gene variants may be related to the 
breast cancer risk and the clinical features of breast cancer in Chinese Han 
women in Northeast China.
