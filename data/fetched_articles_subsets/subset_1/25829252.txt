CD133 has been implicated as a cancer stem cell (CSC) surface marker in several 
malignancies including pancreatic cancer. However, the functional role of this 
surface glycoprotein in the cancer stem cell remains elusive. In this study, we 
determined that CD133 overexpression induced "stemness" properties in MIA-PaCa2 
cells along with increased tumorigenicity, tumor progression, and metastasis in 
vivo. Additionally, CD133 expression induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) and increased in vitro invasion. EMT induction and increased invasiveness 
were mediated by NF-κB activation, as inhibition of NF-κB mitigated these 
effects. This study showed that CD133 expression contributes to pancreatic 
cancer "stemness," tumorigenicity, EMT induction, invasion, and metastasis.
