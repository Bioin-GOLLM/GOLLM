Immunotherapy efficacy is limited in melanoma, and combinations of 
immunotherapies with other modalities have yielded limited improvements but also 
adverse events requiring cessation of treatment. In addition to ineffective 
patient stratification, efficacy is impaired by paucity of intratumoral immune 
cells (itICs); thus, effective strategies to safely increase itICs are needed. 
We report that dietary administration of L-fucose induces fucosylation and cell 
surface enrichment of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II protein 
HLA-DRB1 in melanoma cells, triggering CD4+ T cell-mediated increases in itICs 
and anti-tumor immunity, enhancing immune checkpoint blockade responses. 
Melanoma fucosylation and fucosylated HLA-DRB1 associate with intratumoral T 
cell abundance and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) responder status 
in patient melanoma specimens, suggesting the potential use of melanoma 
fucosylation as a strategy for stratifying patients for immunotherapies. Our 
findings demonstrate that fucosylation is a key mediator of anti-tumor immunity 
and, importantly, suggest that L-fucose is a powerful agent for safely 
increasing itICs and immunotherapy efficacy in melanoma.
