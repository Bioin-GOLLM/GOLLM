The development of effective treatments against infectious diseases is an 
extensive and ongoing process due to the rapid adaptation of bacteria to 
antibiotic-based therapies. However, appropriately designed activity enhancers, 
including antibiotic delivery systems, can increase the effectiveness of current 
antibiotics, overcoming antimicrobial resistance and decreasing the chance of 
contributing to further bacterial resistance. The activity/delivery enhancers 
improve drug absorption, allow targeted antibiotic delivery, improve their 
tissue and biofilm penetration and reduce side effects. This review provides 
insights into various antibiotic activity enhancers, including polymer, lipid, 
and silver-based systems, designed to reduce the adverse effects of antibiotics 
and improve formulation stability and efficacy against multidrug-resistant 
bacteria.
