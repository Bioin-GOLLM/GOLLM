INTRODUCTION: The long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 are unclear, as are the 
factors influencing the evolution. Objective: to assess health-related quality 
of life 1 year after a hospital admission due to COVID-19 and to identify 
factors that may influence it.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study in a tertiary hospital 
from March 2021 to February 2022. Inclusion criteria: ≥18 years old and admitted 
for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exclusion criteria: death, not located, refusal to 
participate, cognitive impairment, and language barrier. Variables: demographic 
data, medical history, clinical and analytical outcomes during hospital 
admission, treatment received, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 following 
admission. Participants were interviewed by phone 1 year after admission, using 
the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire.
RESULTS: There were 486 included patients. The domains yielding the lowest 
scores were general health (median 65%, interquartile range [IQR] 45-80), 
vitality (median 65%, IQR 45-80), and mental health (median 73.5%, IQR 60-100). 
Multivariable analysis showed that female sex and fibromyalgia/fatigue had a 
negative influence on all domains. Obesity was associated with worse outcomes in 
physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, and vitality. Other factors 
associated with worse scores were an older age in physical functioning and high 
age-adjusted Charslon comorbidity in physical functioning and general health. 
Age was associated with better results in emotional role and High C-reactive 
protein at admission on vitality.
CONCLUSION: One year after admission for COVID-19, quality of life remains 
affected, especially the domains of general health, vitality, and mental health. 
Factors associated with worse outcomes are female sex, fibromyalgia/chronic 
fatigue, and obesity.
