In the structure of the phenolate salt of the sulfa drug sulfamethazine with 
3,5-dinitro-salicylic acid, C12H15N4O2S(+)·C7H3N2O7 (-), the dihedral angle 
between the pyrimidine and benzene rings of the cation is 59.70 (17)°. In the 
crystal, cation-anion hydrogen-bonding inter-actions involving 
pyrim-idine-carb-oxy N(+)-H⋯O and amine-carb-oxy N-H⋯O pairs give a cyclic R 2 
(2)(8) motif while secondary N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds between the aniline group and 
both sulfone and nitro O-atom acceptors give a two-dimensional structure 
extending in (001).
