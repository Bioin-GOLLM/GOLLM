BACKGROUND: Few prognostic markers are available for patients with 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing neurosurgical resection of 
symptomatic brain metastases.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether tumor mutation status (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, 
and BRAF) and treatment history were associated with survival after 
neurosurgery.
METHODS: We reviewed the electronic health records of 104 patients with NSCLC 
with genomic profiling who underwent neurosurgical resection for symptomatic 
brain metastases at an academic institution between January 2000 and January 
2018. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to 
evaluate the association between overall survival (OS) after neurosurgery and 
clinicopathologic factors, including mutation status.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients in this study was 61 (±12) years, and 44% were 
men. The median OS after neurosurgery was 24 months (95% confidence interval, 
18-34 months). Our multivariate analysis showed that the presence of an EGFR 
mutation in the tumor was significantly associated with improved OS (hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.214; P = 0.029), independent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor use. 
Presence of KRAS, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF alterations was not associated with 
survival (all P > 0.05). Conversely, older age (HR, 1.039; P = 0.029), a history 
of multiple brain irradiation procedures (HR, 9.197; P < 0.001), and presence of 
extracranial metastasis (HR, 2.556; P = 0.016) resulted in increased risk of 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients requiring surgical resection of an epidermal growth factor 
receptor-mutated NSCLC brain metastasis had an associated improved survival 
compared with patients without this mutation, independent of tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor use. Decreased survival was associated with older age, multiple 
previous brain radiation therapies, and extracranial metastasis.
