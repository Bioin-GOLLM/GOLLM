Despite few studies conducted in non-mammalian species, there has been a number 
of reports pertaining to the occurrence of a natriuretic-like substance in lower 
organisms. Thus, an immunoreactive substance reacting with antibodies directed 
against mammalian atrial natriuretic factor has previously been detected both in 
heart atria and ventricles of a chordate, the frog. This substance was isolated 
and purified from frog heart atria and its amino acid sequence established. The 
sequence, 
Ala-Pro-Arg-Ser-Ser-Asp-Cys-Phe-Gly-Ser-Arg-Ile-Asp-Arg-Ile-Gly-Ala-Gln- Ser-Gly 
- Met-Gly-Cys-Gly-Arg-(Phe), is highly homologous to known mammalian ANF 
sequences. However, when aligned with the complete mammalian ANF precursor 
sequence at positions 121 to 151, it exhibits a single amino acid insertion at 
position 129 and other substitutions at positions 121, 125, 133, 135, 144, 147 
and 148. Some evidence is also presented concerning the occurrence of uncleaved 
frog pronatriodilatin, the precursor form of ANF. This study represents the 
first report pertaining to the structure of a non-mammalian ANF and its 
precursor.
