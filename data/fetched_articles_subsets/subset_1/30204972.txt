THE 3rd W522X MUTATION IN EIF2AK3 GENE FROM TURKEY: A NEW PATIENT WITH 
WOLCOTT-RALLISON SYNDROME.

Wolcott-Rallison Syndrome (WRS), also known as Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia 
with Early-onset Diabetes Mellitus is a rare autosomal recessive multisystemic 
disorder. Its characteristic clinical features are permanent neonatal or early 
infancy insulin-dependent diabetes and later onset skeletal dysplasia. Other 
frequent clinical manifestations are hepatic and renal dysfunction, mental 
retardation, cardiac abnormalities, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, primary 
hypothyroidism and neutropenia. This report presents an 8-year-old WRS case who 
is found to have W522X mutation in EIF2AK3 gene which was only found in two 
other unrelated Turkish families. W522X mutation in EIF2AK3 gene seems to be 
confined to Turkey and may be a common mutation in WRS patients from this 
country. In this paper, we evaluate the clinical features of the patients having 
W522X mutation and we compare this group with other patients reported to date. 
Except the characteristic features as diabetes mellitus and epiphyseal 
dysplasia, all the WRS patients, including patients with W522X mutation, show 
extensive phenotypic variability that correlates poorly to genotype which 
suggests that there is no correlation between a specific mutation and the 
clinical manifestation.
