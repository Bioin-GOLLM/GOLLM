Immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive lymphocyte transfer-based therapies 
have shown great therapeutic potential in cancers with high tumor mutational 
burden (TMB), such as melanoma, but not in cancers with low TMB, such as mutant 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung adenocarcinoma. Precision 
immunotherapy is an unmet need for most cancers, particularly for cancers that 
respond inadequately to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here, we employed 
large-scale MS-based proteogenomic profiling to identify potential immunogenic 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-presented peptides in melanoma and 
EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Similar numbers of peptides were identified 
from both tumor types. Cell line and patient-specific databases (DBs) were 
constructed using variants identified from whole-exome sequencing. A de novo 
search algorithm was used to interrogate the HLA class I immunopeptidome MS 
data. We identified 12 variant peptides and several classes of tumor-associated 
antigen-derived peptides. We constructed a cancer germ line (CG) antigen DB with 
285 antigens. This allowed us to identify 40 class I-presented CG 
antigen-derived peptides. The class I immunopeptidome comprised more than 1000 
post-translationally modified (PTM) peptides representing 58 different PTMs, 
underscoring the critical role PTMs may play in HLA binding. Finally, leveraging 
de novo search algorithm and an annotated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) DB, we 
developed a novel lncRNA-encoded peptide discovery pipeline to identify 44 
lncRNA-derived peptides that are presented by class I. We validated tandem MS 
spectra of select variant, CG antigen, and lncRNA-derived peptides using 
synthetic peptides and performed HLA class I-binding assays to demonstrate 
binding to class I proteins. In summary, we provide direct evidence of HLA class 
I presentation of a large number of variant and tumor-associated peptides in 
both low and high TMB cancer. These results can potentially be useful for 
precision immunotherapies, such as vaccine or adoptive cell therapies in 
melanoma and EGFR-mutant lung cancers.
