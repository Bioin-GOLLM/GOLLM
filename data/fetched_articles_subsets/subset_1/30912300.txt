We report two siblings with microcephaly, early infantile onset seizures, and 
cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, in whom whole exome sequencing revealed a novel 
homozygous missense (c.770T>C, p.[Leu257Pro]) variant in the hedgehog 
acyl-transferase gene (HHAT), encoding an enzyme required for the attachment of 
palmitoyl residues that are critical for multimerization and long and short 
range hedgehog signaling. There is a report of one family with 
Nivelon-Nivelon-Mabille syndrome in which HHAT was proposed as the likely 
candidate gene. The phenotypic overlap with the family we report herein provides 
further evidence implicating HHAT in cerebellar development and the pathogenesis 
of this rare spectrum.
