Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a slowly progressing B-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma characterized by monoclonal IgM gammopathy in the blood and 
infiltration of the bone marrow by clonal lymphoplasmacytic cells. As an 
incurable disease, the goals for therapy for WM are to relieve symptoms, slow 
disease progression, prevent organ damage, and maintain quality of life. 
However, given the rarity of WM, clinical trials comparing treatments for WM are 
limited and there is no definitive standard of care. The selection of first-line 
WM therapy is thus based on patient factors, disease characteristics, and drug 
access, with bendamustine-rituximab and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor 
therapy considered preferred treatments. Other treatments such as proteasome 
inhibitor- or purine analogue-based therapy, alternative chemoimmunotherapy, and 
autologous stem cell transplantation are generally reserved for the relapsed 
setting but may be used in rare circumstances in earlier lines of therapy. This 
paper summarizes the efficacy and safety of these WM therapies and discusses 
considerations for treatment from a Canadian perspective.
