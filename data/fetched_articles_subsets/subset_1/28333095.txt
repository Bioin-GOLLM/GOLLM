The primary function of mitochondria is energy production, a task of particular 
importance especially for cells with a high energy demand like cardiomyocytes. 
The B-cell lymphoma (BCL-2) family member BCL-2 adenovirus E1B 19 
kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) is linked to mitochondrial targeting after 
homodimerization, where it functions in inner membrane depolarization and 
permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) mediating cell death. 
We investigated the basal distribution of cardiac BNIP3 in vivo and its physical 
interaction with the pro-death protein BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator 
(BAX) and with mitochondria using immunoblot analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, 
and continuous wave and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 
techniques. We found that BNIP3 is present as a dimer in the cytosol and in the 
outer membrane of cardiac mitochondria under basal conditions. It forms 
disulfide-bridged, but mainly non-covalent dimers in the cytosol. Heterodimers 
with BAX are formed exclusively in the MOM. Furthermore, our results suggest 
that BNIP3 interacts with the MOM directly via mitochondrial BAX. However, the 
physical interactions with BAX and the MOM did not affect the membrane potential 
and cell viability. These findings suggest that another stimulus other than the 
mere existence of the BNIP3/BAX dimer in the MOM is required to promote BNIP3 
cell-death activity; this could be a potential disturbance of the BNIP3 
distribution homeostasis, namely in the direction of the mitochondria.
