This study reports that the cysteine 22-->glycine 22 substitution in the HIV-1 
Tat 1-86 B significantly attenuates its neurotoxicity. Consistent with previous 
studies, direct interactions of rat hippocampal cells with Tat 1-86 B were shown 
to cause dose-dependent and time-dependent neurotoxicity associated with 
activation of caspases from the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Despite the 
similar binding/uptake properties, Cys22 Tat 1-86 B failed to induce significant 
neurotoxicity and activation of caspases 9 and 3/7 in hippocampal primary 
cultures. Results of the study underscore the important role of cysteine-rich 
domain in mechanism of Tat-mediated neurotoxicity.
