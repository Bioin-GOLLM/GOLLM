BACKGROUND: We report on a patient with a juvenile-onset inherited retinal 
degeneration (IRD) associated with homozygous RP1 mutations inherited by 
uniparental disomy (UPD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 6-year-old healthy girl failed school vision screening 
and was diagnosed with a bull's eye maculopathy. She underwent complete 
ophthalmic examination, full-field electroretinograms (ERG), kinetic fields, 
full-field sensitivity testing (FST), and retinal imaging with spectral domain 
optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and near-infrared (NIR) and short 
wavelength (SW) fundus autofluorescence (FAF).
RESULTS: Visual acuities were relatively preserved (20/30+). There was subtle 
foveal depigmentation but an otherwise normal fundus examination. SD-OCT 
revealed a relatively preserved fovea with thinning of the photoreceptor outer 
nuclear layer with increasing distance from the foveal center coinciding with 
marked attenuation of the NIR and less marked loss of the SW-FAF signal. ERGs 
were non-detectable. Kinetic visual fields were generally full to large (V-4e) 
target but constricted to ~10Â°of eccentricity to I-4e stimuli. Dark-adapted 
thresholds by FST were rod-mediated and elevated by ~2 log units. Homozygous 
pathogenic mutations in RP1 (c.1720_1721del; p.Ser574Asnfs*8) were identified. 
Family member testing revealed father and siblings to be unaffected carriers; 
the mother carried wild-type alleles. Further testing suggested UPD of 
chromosome 8.
CONCLUSION: This report adds support to UPD as a mechanism of inheritance in 
IRDs and stresses the importance of familial testing for genetic diagnosis and 
counseling. Consistent with earlier descriptions of autosomal recessive RP1-IRDs 
our patient showed an early rod and cone photoreceptor degeneration.
