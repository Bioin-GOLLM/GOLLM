Purple gene encodes 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (PTP synthase) in 
Drosophila. The enzyme PTP synthase catalyzes the conversion of dihydroneopterin 
triphosphate (H2-NTP) to 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin (PTP), an important 
intermediate for pterin compounds. The extreme purple mutant, prC4, shows a very 
low activity of PTP synthase. The mutant purple gene has been cloned by 
screening with the subgenomic library of prC4. The size and expression level of 
PTP synthase gene transcripts in prC4 were almost the same as those of the wild 
type. The genomic DNA was also examined in the purple region by Southern blot 
analysis, but no changes in restriction pattern could be detected. Compared with 
the wild type PTP synthase sequence, the mutant PTP synthase of prC4 showed 
three missense mutations: the replacement of alanine 7 by serine (A7S), leucine 
9 by phenylalanine (L9P), and aspartic acid 168 by glycine (D168G). Significance 
of these mutations was discussed in relation to the formation of the oligomeric 
structure of PTP synthase.
