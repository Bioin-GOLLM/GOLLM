BACKGROUND: Prophylactic vaccines are available for women and girls not yet 
infected with HPV, but women already infected with HPV need a treatment to 
prevent progression to high-grade cervical lesions and cancer. GTL001 is a 
bivalent therapeutic vaccine for eradicating HPV-infected cells that contains 
HPV16 E7 and HPV18 E7 both fused to detoxified adenylate cyclase from Bordetella 
pertussis, which binds specifically to CD11b+ antigen-presenting cells. This 
study examined the ability of therapeutic vaccination with GTL001 adjuvanted 
with topical imiquimod cream to induce functional HPV16 E7- and HPV18 
E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses.
METHODS: Binding of GTL001 to human CD11b was assessed by a cell-based 
competition binding assay. Cellular immunogenicity of intradermal vaccination 
with GTL001 was assessed in C57BL/6 mice by enzyme-linked immunospot assay and 
in vivo killing assays. In vivo efficacy of GTL001 vaccination was investigated 
in the TC-1 murine HPV16 E7-expressing tumor model.
RESULTS: GTL001 bound specifically to the human CD11b/CD18 receptor. GTL001 
adjuvanted with topical 5% imiquimod cream induced HPV16 E7 and HPV18 
E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses. This CD8+ T-cell response mediated in vivo 
killing of HPV E7-expressing cells. In the HPV16 E7-expressing tumor model, 
GTL001 adjuvanted with imiquimod but not imiquimod alone or a combination of 
unconjugated HPV16 E7 and HPV18 E7 caused complete tumor regression.
CONCLUSIONS: GTL001 adjuvanted with topical 5% imiquimod is immunogenic and 
induces HPV16 E7 and HPV18 E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses that can kill HPV 
E7-expressing cells and eliminate HPV E7-expressing tumors.
