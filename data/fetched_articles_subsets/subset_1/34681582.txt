Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic 
systemic inflammation causing progressive joint damage that can lead to lifelong 
disability. The pathogenesis of RA involves a complex network of various 
cytokines and cells that trigger synovial cell proliferation and cause damage to 
both cartilage and bone. Involvement of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 is central to the pathogenesis of RA, but recent 
research has revealed that other cytokines such as IL-7, IL-17, IL-21, IL-23, 
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-1β, IL-18, IL-33, 
and IL-2 also play a role. Clarification of RA pathology has led to the 
development of therapeutic agents such as biological disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and further 
details of the immunological background to RA are emerging. This review covers 
existing knowledge regarding the roles of cytokines, related immune cells and 
the immune system in RA, manipulation of which may offer the potential for even 
safer and more effective treatments in the future.
