Reduced serotonergic neurotransmission is implicated in impulsive behavior. We 
studied the triallelic system of the serotonin transporter gene linked 
polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and acute manipulation of serotonin together to 
further delineate the mechanisms by which serotonergic neurotransmission affects 
impulsivity. Fifty-two healthy participants (38 men and 14 women) underwent 
acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, 
parallel group experiment. Impulsive response style was measured on two versions 
of the Continuous Performance Task (CPT), and calculated using signal detection 
theory. We observed a dose-dependent effect for the short (S') allele of the 
5-HTTLPR on impulsive response style. Individuals who had the S'/S' genotype 
were more impulsive than individuals with the L/S' genotype. Participants with 
the L/S' genotype were more impulsive than those with the L/L genotype. ATD 
increased impulsivity in men, and decreased impulsivity in women. These data 
demonstrate for the first time that reduced serotonergic tone as a result of 
either 5-HTTLPR genotype, or experimental ATD, are both independently and 
additively, associated with elevated impulsive response style in Caucasian men.
