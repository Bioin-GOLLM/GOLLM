Myeloproliferative neoplasms can be associated with bleeding manifestations 
which can cause significant morbidities. Although haematologists are aware of 
the likelihood of this complication in the setting of myeloproliferative 
neoplasms, it may often be overlooked especially in patients with no extreme 
elevation of blood counts and those with myelofibrosis. Acquired von Willebrand 
syndrome and platelet dysfunction are the two common diagnoses to be considered 
in this regard. In this review article, we discuss the mechanisms for the 
development of these rare bleeding disorders, their diagnosis and practical 
management.
