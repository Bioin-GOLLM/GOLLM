It is well established that psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have a 
strong genetic component. Recent advances in genetics have confirmed previous 
associations and new loci have been discovered. However, these loci do not fully 
account for the high heritability of psoriasis and PsA and therefore many 
genetic as well as environmental factors remain to be identified. This paper 
reviews the current status of genetic studies in psoriasis and PsA.
