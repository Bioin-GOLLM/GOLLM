Elevated concentration of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor 
for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, 
stroke, peripheral artery disease, and so on. Emerging data suggest that Lp(a) 
contributes to the increased risk for cardiovascular events even in the setting 
of effective reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 
Nevertheless, puzzling issues exist covering potential genetic factors, Lp(a) 
assay, possible individuals for analysis, a cutoff point of increased risk, and 
clinical interventions. In the Chinese population, Lp(a) exhibited a distinctive 
prevalence and regulated various cardiovascular diseases in specific ways. 
Hence, it is valuable to clarify the role of Lp(a) in cardiovascular diseases 
and explore prevention and control measures for the increase in Lp(a) prevalence 
in the Chinese population. This Beijing Heart Society experts' 
scientific statement will present the detailed knowledge concerning 
Lp(a)-related studies combined with Chinese population observations to provide 
the key points of reference.
