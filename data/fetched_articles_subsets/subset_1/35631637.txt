Gaining insights into the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of lead 
compounds is crucial during drug development processes. When it comes to the 
treatment of brain diseases, collecting information at the site of action is 
challenging. There are only a few techniques available that allow for the direct 
sampling from the cerebral interstitial space. This review concerns the 
applicability of microdialysis and other approaches, such as cerebral open flow 
microperfusion and electrochemical biosensors, to monitor macromolecules 
(neuropeptides, proteins, â€¦) in the brain. Microdialysis and cerebral open flow 
microperfusion can also be used to locally apply molecules at the same time at 
the site of sampling. Innovations in the field are discussed, together with the 
pitfalls. Moreover, the 'nuts and bolts' of the techniques and the current 
research gaps are addressed. The implementation of these techniques could help 
to improve drug development of brain-targeted drugs.
