Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) plays a pivotal role in connecting transmembrane 
receptor integrin to the actin cytoskeleton and thereby regulating diverse 
cell-adhesion-dependent processes. The kinase domain (KD) of ILK is 
indispensable for its function, but the underlying molecular basis remains 
enigmatic. Here we present the crystal structure of the ILK KD bound to its 
cytoskeletal regulator, the C-terminal calponin homology domain of alpha-parvin. 
While maintaining a canonical kinase fold, the ILK KD displays a striking 
pseudoactive site conformation. We show that rather than performing the kinase 
function, this conformation specifically recognizes alpha-parvin for promoting 
effective assembly of ILK into focal adhesions. The alpha-parvin-bound ILK KD 
can simultaneously engage integrin beta cytoplasmic tails. These results thus 
define ILK as a distinct pseudokinase that mechanically couples integrin and 
alpha-parvin for mediating cell adhesion. They also highlight functional 
diversity of the kinase fold and its "active" site in mediating many biological 
processes.
