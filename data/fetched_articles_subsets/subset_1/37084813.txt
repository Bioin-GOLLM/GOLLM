Integration of retroviral DNA into the host genome involves the formation of 
integrase (IN)-DNA complexes termed intasomes. Further characterization of these 
complexes is needed to understand their assembly process. Here, we report the 
single-particle cryo-EM structure of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) strand 
transfer complex (STC) intasome produced with IN and a preassembled viral/target 
DNA substrate at 3.36 Å resolution. The conserved intasome core region 
consisting of IN subunits contributing active sites interacting with 
viral/target DNA has a resolution of 3 Å. Our structure demonstrated the 
flexibility of the distal IN subunits relative to the IN subunits in the 
conserved intasome core, similar to results previously shown with the RSV 
octameric cleaved synaptic complex intasome produced with IN and viral DNA only. 
An extensive analysis of higher resolution STC structure helped in the 
identification of nucleoprotein interactions important for intasome assembly. 
Using structure-function studies, we determined the mechanisms of several IN-DNA 
interactions critical for assembly of both RSV intasomes. We determined the role 
of IN residues R244, Y246, and S124 in cleaved synaptic complex and STC intasome 
assemblies and their catalytic activities, demonstrating differential effects. 
Taken together, these studies advance our understanding of different RSV 
intasome structures and molecular determinants involved in their assembly.
