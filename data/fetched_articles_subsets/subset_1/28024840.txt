Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is a rare autosomal dominant channelopathy 
characterized by periodic paralysis, cardiac dysrhythmias, and distinct facial 
and skeletal characteristics, that may be variably present in the affected 
members. Mutations in the KCNJ2 and KCNJ5 gene have been associated with this 
disorder. We describe a family in which several members presented with different 
ATS phenotypes. The proband, a 4-year-old boy, presented with recurrent episodes 
of muscle weakness from an early age; two siblings suffered cardiac arrhythmia 
but had never experienced episodes of paralysis; their mother reported 
occasional muscle pain after exercise and unspecified cardiac arrhythmias. The 
analysis of KCNJ2 gene in the proband disclosed the presence of a pathogenic 
mutation (p.R218W), that was subsequently confirmed in the other affected 
subjects. Our results underline the possible intrafamilial phenotypic 
variability, ranging from full clinical triad to exclusive cardiac or muscular 
involvement, representing a diagnostic challenge that may also delay adequate 
management. There are still limited data on the treatment of ATS; in our patient 
there was clinical improvement with dichlorphenamide.
