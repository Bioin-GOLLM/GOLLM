To achieve substrate specificity, protein phosphate 1 (PP1) forms holoenzymes 
with hundreds of regulatory and inhibitory proteins. Inhibitor-3 (I3) is an 
ancient inhibitor of PP1 with putative roles in PP1 maturation and the 
regulation of PP1 activity. Here, we show that I3 residues 27-68 are necessary 
and sufficient for PP1 binding and inhibition. In addition to a canonical RVxF 
motif, which is shared by nearly all PP1 regulators and inhibitors, and a 
non-canonical SILK motif, I3 also binds PP1 via multiple basic residues that 
bind directly in the PP1 acidic substrate binding groove, an interaction that 
provides a blueprint for how substrates bind this groove for dephosphorylation. 
Unexpectedly, this interaction positions a CCC (cys-cys-cys) motif to bind 
directly across the PP1 active site. Using biophysical and inhibition assays, we 
show that the I3 CCC motif binds and inhibits PP1 in an unexpected dynamic, 
fuzzy manner, via transient engagement of the PP1 active site metals. Together, 
these data not only provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms by which 
IDP protein regulators of PP1 achieve inhibition, but also shows that fuzzy 
interactions between IDPs and their folded binding partners, in addition to 
enhancing binding affinity, can also directly regulate enzyme activity.
