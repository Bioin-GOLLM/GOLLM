YTHDF2 binds and destabilizes N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified mRNA. The extent 
to which this branch of m6A RNA-regulatory pathway functions in vivo and 
contributes to mammalian development remains unknown. Here we find that YTHDF2 
deficiency is partially permissive in mice and results in female-specific 
infertility. Using conditional mutagenesis, we demonstrate that YTHDF2 is 
autonomously required within the germline to produce MII oocytes that are 
competent to sustain early zygotic development. Oocyte maturation is associated 
with a wave of maternal RNA degradation, and the resulting relative changes to 
the MII transcriptome are integral to oocyte quality. The loss of YTHDF2 results 
in the failure to regulate transcript dosage of a cohort of genes during oocyte 
maturation, with enrichment observed for the YTHDF2-binding consensus and 
evidence of m6A in these upregulated genes. In summary, the m6A-reader YTHDF2 is 
an intrinsic determinant of mammalian oocyte competence and early zygotic 
development.
