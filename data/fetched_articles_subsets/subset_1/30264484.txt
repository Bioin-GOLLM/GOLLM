Beta-secretase 1 (BACE-1) is an aspartyl protease implicated in the 
overproduction of β-amyloid fibrils responsible for Alzheimer disease. The 
process of β-amyloid genesis is known to be pH dependent, with an activity peak 
between solution pH of 3.5 and 5.5. We have studied the pH-dependent dynamics of 
BACE-1 to better understand the pH dependent mechanism. We have implemented 
support for graphics processor unit (GPU) accelerated constant pH molecular 
dynamics within the AMBER molecular dynamics software package and employed this 
to determine the relative population of different aspartyl dyad protonation 
states in the pH range of greatest β-amyloid production, followed by 
conventional molecular dynamics to explore the differences among the various 
aspartyl dyad protonation states. We observed a difference in dynamics between 
double-protonated, mono-protonated, and double-deprotonated states over the 
known pH range of higher activity. These differences include Tyr 71-aspartyl 
dyad proximity and active water lifetime. This work indicates that Tyr 71 
stabilizes catalytic water in the aspartyl dyad active site, enabling BACE-1 
activity.
