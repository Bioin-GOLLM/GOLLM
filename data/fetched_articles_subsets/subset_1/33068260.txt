The recent emergence and rapid global spread of the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose an unprecedented medical and 
socioeconomic crisis, and the disease caused by it, Coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 
March 11, 2020. Chinese scientists and physicians rapidly identified the 
causative pathogen, which turned out to be a novel betacoronavirus with high 
sequence similarities to bat and pangolin coronaviruses. The scientific 
community has ignited tremendous efforts to unravel the biological underpinning 
of SARS-CoV-2, which constitutes the foundation for therapy and vaccine 
development strategies. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on the 
genome, structure, receptor, and origin of SARS-CoV-2.
