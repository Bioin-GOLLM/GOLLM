BACKGROUND: Cisplatin-based adjuvant treatment of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) has become standard, thanks to the studies that have shown a significant 
survival advantage. The identification of patients who could benefit from this 
adjuvant treatment would allow ineffective and toxic administrations to be 
avoided. Immunohistochemical expression of the excision repair 
cross-complementation group (ERCC)-1 protein has been associated with response 
to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC, and some polymorphisms of 
the genes involved in DNA repair have been shown to be associated with survival 
in advanced NSCLC.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the progression-free survival 
and tolerability of adjuvant treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy in 
patients with NSCLC, according to common DNA repair gene polymorphisms and ERCC1 
expression.
METHODS: We investigated the association of three DNA repair gene polymorphisms 
- Asn118Asn in ERCC1 (rs11615), Lys751Gln in ERCC2 (rs13181), and Asp1104His in 
ERCC5 (rs17655) - with the progression-free survival of 85 patients treated with 
platinum-based chemotherapy after surgery for NSCLC.
RESULTS: We did not find significant associations between any of these 
polymorphisms and progression-free survival, nor did we observe any difference 
in progression-free survival according to ERCC1 expression.
CONCLUSION: The previously reported impact of DNA repair gene polymorphisms on 
platinum-based chemotherapy treatment of advanced NSCLC was not observed in our 
study in the adjuvant setting.
