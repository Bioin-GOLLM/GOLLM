Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKI) has been widely exploited to disrupt aberrant phosphorylation 
flux in cancer. However, a bottleneck of potent TKIs is the acquisition of drug 
resistance mutations, secondary effects, and low ability to attenuate tumor 
progression. We have developed an alternative means of targeting EGFR that 
relies on protein degradation through two consecutive routes, ultimately leading 
to cancer cell detachment-related death. We describe furfuryl derivatives of 
4-allyl-5-[2-(4-alkoxyphenyl)-quinolin-4-yl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol that bind 
to and weakly inhibit EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and induce strong endocytic 
degradation of the receptor in cancer cells. The compound-promoted depletion of 
EGFR resulted in the sequestration of non-phosphorylated Bim, which no longer 
ensured the integrity of the cytoskeleton machinery, as shown by the detachment 
of cancer cells from the extracellular matrix (ECM). Of particular note, the 
longer CH3(CH2)n chains in the terminal moiety of the anti-EGFR molecules confer 
higher hydrophobicity in the allosteric site located in the immediate vicinity 
of the catalytic pocket. Small compounds accelerated and enhanced EGFR and 
associated proteins degradation during EGF and/or glutamine starvation of 
cultures, thereby demonstrating high potency in killing cancer cells by 
simultaneously modulating signaling and metabolic pathways. We propose a 
plausible mechanism of anti-cancer action by small degraders through the 
allosteric site of EGFR. Our data represent a rational and promising perspective 
in the treatment of aggressive tumors.
