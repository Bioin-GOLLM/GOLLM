Alzheimer's disease is understood to be caused by amyloid fibrils and oligomers 
formed by aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. This review article presents 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of Aβ peptides and Aβ fragments on 
their aggregation, aggregation inhibition, amyloid fibril conformations in 
equilibrium, and disruption of the amyloid fibril by ultrasonic wave and 
infrared laser irradiation. In the aggregation of Aβ, a β-hairpin structure 
promotes the formation of intermolecular β-sheet structures. Aβ peptides tend to 
exist at hydrophilic/hydrophobic interfaces and form more β-hairpin structures 
than in bulk water. These facts are the reasons why the aggregation is 
accelerated at the interface. We also explain how polyphenols, which are 
attracting attention as aggregation inhibitors of Aβ peptides, interact with Aβ. 
An MD simulation study of the Aβ amyloid fibrils in equilibrium is also 
presented: the Aβ amyloid fibril has a different structure at one end from that 
at the other end. The amyloid fibrils can be destroyed by ultrasonic wave and 
infrared laser irradiation. The molecular mechanisms of these amyloid fibril 
disruptions are also explained, particularly focusing on the function of water 
molecules. Finally, we discuss the prospects for developing treatments for 
Alzheimer's disease using MD simulations.
