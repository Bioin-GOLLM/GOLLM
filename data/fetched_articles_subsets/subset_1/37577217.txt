BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We previously reported that carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) 
expression was suppressed following liver injury. The study aimed to explore the 
role of interleukin (IL)-33 in liver injury and examine the mechanism by which 
IL-33 regulates CES1.
METHODS: IL-33 and CES1 levels were determined in the livers of patients and 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, acetaminophen (APAP)-treated mice. We constructed 
IL-33 and ST2 knockout (KO) mice. ST2-enriched immune cells in livers were 
screened to identify the responsible cells. Macrophage-derived exosome (MDE) 
activity was tested by adding exosome inhibitors. Micro-RNAs (miRs) were 
extracted from control and IL-33-stimulated MDEs (IL-33-MDEs) and subjected miR 
sequencing (miR-Seq). Candidate miR was tested in vitro and in vivo and its 
binding of a target gene was assessed by luciferase reporter assays. 
Lentivirus-vector cellular transfection and transcript silencing were used to 
examine pathways mediating IL-33 suppression of miR-27b-3p.
RESULTS: Patient liver IL-33 and CES1 expression levels were inversely 
correlated. CES1 downregulation in liver injury was rescued in both 
IL-33-deficient and ST2 KO mice. Macrophages were shown to be responsible for 
IL-33 effects. IL-33-MDEs reduced CES1 levels in hepatocytes. Exosomal miR-Seq 
and qRT-PCR demonstrated increased miR-27b-3p levels in IL-33-MDEs; miR-27b-3p 
was implicated in Nrf2 targeting. IL-33 inhibition of miR-27b-3p was found to be 
GATA3-dependent.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-33-ST2-GATA3 pathway signaling increases miR-27b-3p content in 
MDEs, which upon being internalized by hepatocytes reduce CES1 expression by 
inhibiting Nrf2. The elucidation of this mechanism in this study contributes to 
a better understanding of CES1 dysregulation in liver injury.
