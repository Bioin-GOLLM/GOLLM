BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder, which is caused by the 
CFTR protein defects. Along with CFTR dysfunction, inflammation plays a key role 
in the disease outcomes. Inflammation may develop due to the internal 
dysfunction of the CFTR protein or external factors. Curcumin affects the CFTR 
protein function primarily as a corrector and potentiator and secondary as an 
anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agent. The present study aims to assess the 
impact of nano-curcumin on clinical and inflammatory markers in children with 
CF.
METHODS: This prospective, double blind control trial will be conducted at the 
Akbar Children's Hospital in Mashhad, Iran. Children with CF will be enrolled 
based on the eligibility criteria. Placebo and curcumin with the maximum dose of 
80 mg considering the body surface of the patients will be administrated for 
3 months. The primary outcome is to evaluate inflammation based on serum 
interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and hs-CRP, stool calprotectin, and neutrophil 
count of nasopharyngeal swab. The secondary outcome involved clinical assessment 
via spirometry, anthropometrics, and quality of life. They will be assessed 
before and after 3 months.
DISCUSSION: Due to the multifarious effects of curcumin on CF disease, it could 
be proposed as a nutritional strategy in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.
