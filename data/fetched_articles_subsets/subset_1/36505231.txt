Angiotensin-converting enzyme I (ACE I) is a zinc-containing metallopeptidase 
involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) that helps in the regulation of 
hypertension and maintains fluid balance otherwise, which results in 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of the leading reasons of global deaths is 
due to CVDs. RAAS also plays a central role in maintaining homeostasis of the CV 
system. The commercial drugs available to treat CVDs possess several fatal side 
effects. Hence, phytochemicals like peptides having plant-based origin should be 
explored and utilized as alternative therapies. Soybean is an important 
leguminous crop that simultaneously possesses medicinal properties. Soybean 
extracts are used in many drug formulations for treating diabetes and other 
disorders and ailments. Soy proteins and its edible products such as tofu have 
shown potential inhibitory activity against ACE. Thus, this review briefly 
describes various soy proteins and products that can be used to inhibit ACE 
thereby providing new scope for the identification of potential candidates that 
can help in the design of safer and natural treatments for CVDs.
