Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a rare inherited disorder usually 
presenting in childhood with early contractures, slowly progressive 
scapulohumeroperoneal weakness/atrophy and potentially fatal dilated 
cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. We evaluated clinical and genetic 
findings of 32 patients with EDMD phenotype from 14 unrelated families, 
diagnosed at the Department of Neurology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine between 
1989 and 2022. Twenty-three patients from 8 unrelated families were diagnosed 
with EDMD1 (58%), 5 patients from 3 families with EDMD2 (21%), and 2 patients 
from 1 family with the rare EDMD3 (7%). Genetic diagnosis was achieved in 12 
unrelated kinships with classical EDMD phenotype (86%) by applying panel 
testing, but no mutation could be determined in 2 patients with classical EDMD 
phenotype from 2 unrelated families (14%). Three novel pathogenic variants 
(c.19delC, c.416_417delTT, c.123C > G) in EMD, and a novel (c.1441dupT) 
heterozygous likely pathogenic variant in LMNA gene were found. This is the 
largest cohort from Turkey, expanding the genetic spectrum of EDMD, and 
providing clues for genetic testing of EDMD in Turkey.
