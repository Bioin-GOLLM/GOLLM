Patients affected by transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia are prone to developing 
several clinical complications, mostly related to the iron overload. We report 
the case of a patient affected by transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) 
developing acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In our case, the therapeutic 
management was significantly complicated not only by myocardial dysfunction, but 
also by the occurrence of the differentiation syndrome following all-trans 
retinoic acid (ATRA) administration. We carried out a careful revision of the 
current literature on the occurrence of hematological malignancies in 
β-thalassemia patients to investigate the major complications so far described. 
APL occurrence in β-thalassemia patients has been very rarely reported, and our 
experience suggests that TDT patients suffering pre-existing comorbidities may 
develop a potentially fatal complication during ATRA therapy.
