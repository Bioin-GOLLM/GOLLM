The ventricular zone (VZ) of the developing cerebral cortex is a 
pseudostratified epithelium that contains progenitors undergoing precisely 
regulated divisions at its most apical side, the ventricular lining (VL). 
Mitotic perturbations can contribute to pathological mechanisms leading to 
cortical malformations. The HeCo mutant mouse exhibits subcortical band 
heterotopia (SBH), likely to be initiated by progenitor delamination from the VZ 
early during corticogenesis. The causes for this are however, currently unknown. 
Eml1, a microtubule (MT)-associated protein of the EMAP family, is impaired in 
these mice. We first show that MT dynamics are perturbed in mutant progenitor 
cells in vitro. These may influence interphase and mitotic MT mechanisms and 
indeed, centrosome and primary cilia were altered and spindles were found to be 
abnormally long in HeCo progenitors. Consistently, MT and spindle length 
regulators were identified in EML1 pulldowns from embryonic brain extracts. 
Finally, we found that mitotic cell shape is also abnormal in the mutant VZ. 
These previously unidentified VZ characteristics suggest altered cell 
constraints which may contribute to cell delamination.
