A conserved stem-loop motif of the constitutive decay element (CDE) in the 3' 
UTR of mRNAs is recognized by the ROQ domain of Roquin, which mediates mRNA 
degradation. Here we report two crystal structures of the Homo sapiens ROQ 
domain in complex with CDE RNA. The ROQ domain has an elongated shape with three 
subdomains. The 19-nt Hmgxb3 CDE is bound as a stem-loop to domain III. The 
23-nt TNF RNA is bound as a duplex to a separate site at the interface between 
domains I and II. Mutagenesis studies confirm that the ROQ domain has two 
separate RNA-binding sites, one for stem-loop RNA (A site) and the other for 
double-stranded RNA (B site). Mutation in either site perturbs the 
Roquin-mediated degradation of HMGXB3 and IL6 mRNAs in human cells, 
demonstrating the importance of both sites for mRNA decay.
