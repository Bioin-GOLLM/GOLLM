Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has played a significant role in understanding the 
epidemiology and biology of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we investigate the use of 
SARS-CoV-2 WGS in Southeast and East Asian countries as a genomic surveillance 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nottingham-Indonesia Collaboration for Clinical 
Research and Training (NICCRAT) initiative has facilitated collaboration between 
the University of Nottingham and a team in the Research Center for 
Biotechnology, National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN), to carry out a 
small number of SARS-CoV-2 WGS in Indonesia using Oxford Nanopore Technology 
(ONT). Analyses of SARS- CoV-2 genomes deposited on GISAID reveal the importance 
of clinical and demographic metadata collection and the importance of open 
access and data sharing. Lineage and phylogenetic analyses of two periods 
defined by the Delta variant outbreak reveal that: (1) B.1.466.2 variants were 
the most predominant in Indonesia before the Delta variant outbreak, having a 
unique spike gene mutation N439K at more than 98% frequency, (2) Delta variants 
AY.23 sub-lineage took over after June 2021, and (3) the highest rate of virus 
transmissions between Indonesia and other countries was through interactions 
with Singapore and Japan, two neighbouring countries with a high degree of 
access and travels to and from Indonesia.
