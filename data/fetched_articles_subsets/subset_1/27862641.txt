This study aimed to investigate associations between oxytocin receptor gene 
(OXT-R) polymorphisms (rs53576 and rs2254298), their interaction with maternal 
care (GxE), and ED behaviours in a community sample. We studied 3698 women from 
the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) who participated in 
a two-phase prevalence study of lifetime ED and had genotype data. The GG 
rs53576 genotype was associated with binge eating and purging, and the rs2254298 
AG/AA genotype with restrictive eating lifetime. In addition, the rs2254298 
AG/AA genotype interacted with poor maternal care to increase the odds of binge 
eating and purging (odds ratio = 4.40 (95% confidence intervals: 1.11-17.4)). 
This study replicates previous findings of an association between OXT-R 
polymorphisms and ED, and it is the first to show an interaction between OXT-R 
genotype and poor maternal care. As such, these findings highlight the important 
role of oxytocin in understanding the pathophysiology of ED. © 2016 The Authors
