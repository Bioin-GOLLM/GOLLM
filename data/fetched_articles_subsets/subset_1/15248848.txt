BACKGROUND: We have previously reported a relationship between increased airway 
responsiveness (AR) in infancy and reduced childhood lung function.
OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to determine whether the Arg16Gly 
polymorphism of the beta2 adrenoceptor (beta2AR) gene was important to this 
relationship.
METHODS: A cohort that initially numbered 253 individuals underwent assessments 
of AR and lung function aged 1 month, 6 and 11 years; genotyping for 
polymorphisms of the beta(2)AR was performed.
RESULTS: At 1 month of age, the genotype homozygous Arg16 (n=24) was associated 
with a mean increase in log dose-response slope (AR) of 0.27 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.07, 0.49] compared with the genotype homozygous Gly16 (n=58), 
P=0.01. At 11 years of age, the genotype homozygous Arg16 (n=35) was associated 
with a mean reduction in the percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 
5.3% [95% CI 0.3, 10.2] compared with the genotype homozygous Gly16 (n=65), 
P=0.03. There was no association between the Arg16Gly polymorphism and atopy or 
diagnosed asthma. However, nine of 69 individuals with the genotype homozygous 
Gly16 were admitted to hospital with asthma compared with five out of 111 
individuals with the remaining genotypes (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The Arg16Gly polymorphism may be important to the association 
between increased AR in infancy and reduced lung function in childhood and may 
also be a determinant of asthma severity in children but not asthma per se.
