Cladribine is an oral synthetic purine analog that depletes lymphocytes and 
induces a dose-dependent reduction of T and B cells. It was approved for the 
therapy of highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Given 
cladribine's mechanism of action, an increased risk of malignancies was 
suspected from the number of cancers that occurred in the 3.5 mg/kg-treated arm 
(CLARITY study). We showed that cladribine inhibits cell proliferation on three 
melanoma cell lines tested, irrespectively of their mutational oncogenic status 
and invasive/metastatic potential. Aggregated safety data demonstrated that the 
risk of melanoma is not confirmed.
