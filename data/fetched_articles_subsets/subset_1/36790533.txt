Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) is a pigmentary genodermatosis 
characterized by a mixture of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules 
distributed randomly over the body. Although Sterile Alpha motif- and SH3 
domain-containing protein 1 (SASH1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 
6 (ABCB6) have been identified as causative genes for this disorder, some cases 
involve unknown pathogenic genes. In this study, whole-exome sequencing, data 
analysis, and Sanger sequencing were utilized for a four-generation extended 
Chinese family with DUH. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (c. 517C > T 
(p.P173S), rs772027021) variant in exon 5 of Period Circadian Regulator 3 (PER3) 
(NM_001289861) was detected in each affected individual of the DUH family; the 
c. 517C > T SNP of PER3 (PER3rs772027021 SNP) and a novel mutation in exon 14 of 
SASH1 (c. 1574C > G (p.T525R)) were both found in the proband. The affected 
individuals carrying PER3rs772027021 SNP in this family demonstrated 
mild-pigmented phenotypes compared to those of the proband carrying 
PER3rs772027021 SNP and SASH1 T525R mutation. Increased melanin synthesis was 
induced by PER3rs772027021 SNP in the melanocytes of affected epithelial 
tissues. Mutated SASH1 or PER3rs772027021 SNP alone or cooperation of mutation 
of SASH1 and PER3rs772027021 SNP synergistically led to increased melanin 
synthesis and enhanced proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro. We also 
phenotypically characterized a commercially available zebrafish mutant line 
harboring the PER3rs772027021 SNP to induce melanocyte proliferation in vivo. 
Our results are the first to reveal that this PER3 SNP may be pathogenic for a 
novel DUH subtype with mild hyperpigmented and/or hypopigmented phenotypes and 
that mutation of SASH1 and PER3 cooperatively promotes hyperpigmentation 
phenotypes. KEY MESSAGES: PER3 rs772027021 SNP is identified to be associated 
with hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation phenotype and the novel 
pathogenic variant of PER3 rs772027021 SNP probably contributed the pathogenesis 
of DUH. SASH1T525R mutation is confirmed to associate with DUH. A novel 
autosomal dominant inheritance DUH subtype with mild pigmentated phenotypes is 
caused by the PER3rs772027021 SNP.
