Caffeine is a metabolite derived from purine nucleotides, typically accounting 
for 2-5% of the dry weight of tea and 1-2% of the dry weight of coffee. In the 
tea and coffee plants, the main synthesis pathway of caffeine is a four-step 
sequence consisting of three methylation reactions and one nucleosidase reaction 
using xanthine as a precursor. In bacteria, caffeine degradation occurs mainly 
through the pathways of N-demethylation and C-8 oxidation. However, a study 
fully and systematically summarizing the metabolism and application of caffeine 
in microorganisms has not been established elsewhere. In the present study, we 
provide a review of the biosynthesis, microbial degradation, gene expression, 
and application of caffeine microbial degradation. The present review aims to 
further elaborate the mechanism of caffeine metabolism by microorganisms and 
explore the development prospects in this field.
