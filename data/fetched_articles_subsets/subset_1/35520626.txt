OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the levels of 8-oxoG and 
8-oxodG in urine of patients with cervical carcinoma and healthy women to 
evaluate their influences on cervical carcinoma.
METHODS: In this study, urine samples were collected from 70 patients with 
cervical carcinoma, 24 patients with one-year follow-up, and 100 healthy women. 
The contents of 8-oxodG and 8-oxoG in urine were assayed by ultra-high 
performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS).
RESULTS: The levels of 8-oxoG and 8-oxodG were higher in patients with cervical 
carcinoma (P < 0.000), while AUC of 8-oxoG and 8-oxodG was higher than 0.7. 
Specifically, the high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) positive group had higher 8-oxoG levels 
(P < 0.000), but there was no difference in 8-oxodG levels. Yet, 8-oxoG level 
was associated with lymphatic metastasis, lymph-vascular space infiltration 
(LVSI) and stromal infiltration, while 8-oxodG level was affected by the 
differentiation degree and stromal infiltration. According to statistics, the 
distinct cut-off index of lymphatic metastasis was 7.282 nmol/mmol creatinine. 
After operation, the concentrations of 8-oxoG and 8-oxodG dropped significantly 
(8-oxoG P < 0.000, 8-oxodG P = 0.004). Except for chemotherapy group, the 
urinary 8-oxoG dose of all treatment groups and 8-oxodG dose of 
chemo-radiotherapy group declined obviously.
CONCLUSIONS: 8-oxoG may be a potential biomarker for cervical carcinoma.
