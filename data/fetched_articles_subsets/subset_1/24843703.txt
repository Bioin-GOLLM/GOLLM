The prevalence of metabolic syndrome, obesity and insulin resistance has become 
an epidemic in the world. A strong association exists between metabolic syndrome 
and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), though the etiology of NAFLD is 
still unclear. This close association leads to numerous clinical studies to 
investigate the effects of insulin sensitizers, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), on 
hepatic fat accumulation. Thiazolidinediones affect glucose and lipid metabolism 
in insulin-sensitive tissues, which in turn reduces the lipid content in the 
liver by modulating several mediators. In the present review, we discuss key 
modulators - adiponectin and sirtulin-adenosine monophosphate activated protein 
kinase signaling - as the mechanisms responsible for NAFLD related to metabolic 
syndrome.
