Arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis (ARC) syndrome is a rare but fatal 
autosomal recessive multisystem disorder caused by mutations in the VPS33B or 
VIPAR gene. The classical presentation of ARC includes congenital joint 
contractures, renal tubular dysfunction, and cholestasis. Additional features 
include ichthyosis, central nervous system malformation, platelet anomalies, and 
severe failure to thrive. Diagnosis of ARC syndrome relies on clinical features, 
organ biopsy, and mutational analysis. However, no specific treatment currently 
exists for this syndrome.
CONCLUSION: This is an overview of the latest knowledge regarding the genetic 
features and clinical manifestations of ARC syndrome. Greater awareness and 
understanding of this syndrome should allow more timely intervention with 
potential for improving long-term outcome.
