BACKGROUND: We studied the effects of various factors, including genetic 
polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, CYP3A5, and ABCB1, age, gender, 
and smoking habit on the steady-state plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and 
its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, in 89 patients with schizophrenia 
(46 males, 43 females).
METHODS: All patients had been receiving fixed doses of aripiprazole for at 
least 2 weeks. The daily doses were 24 mg (n = 56) and 12 mg (n = 33). No other 
drugs except biperiden and flunitrazepam were coadministered. Plasma 
concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were measured using 
liquid chromatography with mass-spectrometric detection. The CYP2D6 (CYP2D6*5, 
CYP2D6*10, and CYP2D6*14), CYP3A5 (CYP3A5*3), and ABCB1 (C3435T and G2677T/A) 
genotypes were identified by PCR analyses.
RESULTS: The mean concentration/dose ratios of aripiprazole and the sum of 
aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were significantly higher in patients with 
1 (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01) or 2 (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) mutated alleles for 
CYP2D6 than in those without mutated alleles. No differences were found in the 
values of dehydroaripiprazole among CYP2D6 genotypes. There were no differences 
in the values of aripiprazole, dehydroaripiprazole, and the sum of the 2 
compounds among CYP3A5 or the 2 ABCB1 variants. Multiple regression analyses 
including these polymorphisms, age, gender, and smoking habit showed that only 
the number of mutated alleles for CYP2D6 was correlated with mean 
concentration/dose ratios of aripiprazole [standardized partial correlation 
coefficients (beta) = 0.420, P < 0.001] and the sum of the 2 compounds 
(standardized beta = 0.335, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that CYP2D6 genotypes play an 
important role in controlling steady-state plasma concentrations of aripiprazole 
and the sum of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole in Asian subjects, whereas 
CYP3A5 and ABCB1 genotypes seemed unlikely to have an impact.
