Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a T-cell malignancy predominantly 
driven by the oncogenic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), accounting for 
approximately 15% of all paediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients with central 
nervous system (CNS) relapse are particularly difficult to treat with a 3-year 
overall survival of 49% and a median survival of 23.5 months. The 
second-generation ALK inhibitor brigatinib shows superior penetration of the 
blood-brain barrier unlike the first-generation drug crizotinib and has shown 
promising results in ALK+ non-small-cell lung cancer. However, the benefits of 
brigatinib in treating aggressive paediatric ALK+ ALCL are largely unknown. We 
established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) resource from ALK+ ALCL patients 
at or before CNS relapse serving as models to facilitate the development of 
future therapies. We show in vivo that brigatinib is effective in inducing the 
remission of PDX models of crizotinib-resistant (ALK C1156Y, TP53 loss) ALCL and 
furthermore that it is superior to crizotinib as a second-line approach to the 
treatment of a standard chemotherapy relapsed/refractory ALCL PDX pointing to 
brigatinib as a future therapeutic option.
