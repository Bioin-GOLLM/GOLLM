OBJECTIVE: RASopathies (Noonan syndrome (NS) and Noonan-related syndromes) are 
neurodevelopmental syndromes resulting from germline mutations in genes that 
participate in the rat sarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinases (RAS/MAPK) 
pathway (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF, KRAS or NRAS, and SHOC2). Some monogenic conditions 
are associated with the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and a 
few reports described the association of SLE with NS. We aim to search for a 
relationship between RASopathy and the development of SLE.
METHODS: We reported for the first time a case of 13-year-old boy with NS with 
loose anagen hair (NSLAH) resulting from mutation in SHOC2 who developed an 
autoimmune disorder that fulfilled four American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 
criteria for the classification of SLE (polyarthritis, pericarditis, antinuclear 
antibodies, and anti-DNA antibodies). The case report then prompted a literature 
review by a systematic search for English and French articles on the subjects of 
RASopathies and SLE that had English abstracts in PubMed from 1966 to 2012.
RESULTS: We identified seven additional patients with RASopathy and SLE. The 
male-to-female ratio was 1:1 and age at onset of SLE ranged from 5 to 32 years. 
The most common features were polyarthritis (7/8 patients), autoimmune cytopenia 
(4/8 patients), and pericarditis (4/8 patients) while only one patient presented 
with skin involvement.
CONCLUSION: The association of two rare diseases in eight patients suggests that 
RASopathies may be associated with the development of SLE, which is 
characterized by a higher male-to-female ratio, a lower rate of skin 
involvement, and a higher rate of pericarditis than "classic" SLE.
