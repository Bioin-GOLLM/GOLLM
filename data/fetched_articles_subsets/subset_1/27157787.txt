ATP-Binding Cassette transporters are involved in the efflux of xenobiotic 
compounds and are responsible for decreasing drug accumulation in multidrug 
resistant (MDR) cells. Discovered by structure-based virtual screening 
algorithms, bafetinib, a Bcr-Abl/Lyn tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was found to 
have inhibitory effects on both ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR in this in-vitro 
investigation. Bafetinib significantly sensitized ABCB1 and ABCG2 overexpressing 
MDR cells to their anticancer substrates and increased the intracellular 
accumulation of anticancer drugs, particularly doxorubicin and [(3)H]-paclitaxel 
in ABCB1 overexpressing cells; mitoxantrone and [(3)H]-mitoxantrone in ABCG2 
overexpressing cells, respectively. Bafetinib stimulated ABCB1 ATPase activities 
while inhibited ABCG2 ATPase activities. There were no significant changes in 
the expression level or the subcellular distribution of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in the 
cells exposed to 3 μM of bafetinib. Overall, our study indicated that bafetinib 
reversed ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR by blocking the drug efflux function of 
these transporters. These findings might be useful in developing combination 
therapy for MDR cancer treatment.
