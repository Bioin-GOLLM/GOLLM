Rapid molecular profiling of biological tissues with picosecond infrared laser 
mass spectrometry (PIRL-MS) has enabled the detection of clinically important 
histologic types and molecular subtypes of human cancers in as little as 10 s of 
data collection and analysis time. Utilizing an engineered cell line model of 
actionable BRAF-V600E mutation, we observed statistically significant 
differences in 10 s PIRL-MS molecular profiles between BRAF-V600E and BRAF-wt 
cells. Multivariate statistical analyses revealed a list of mass-to-charge (m/z) 
values most significantly responsible for the identification of BRAF-V600E 
mutation status in this engineered cell line that provided a highly controlled 
testbed for this observation. These metabolites predicted BRAF-V600E expression 
in human melanoma cell lines with greater than 98% accuracy. Through 
chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry analysis of cell line extracts, a 
30-member "metabolite array" was characterized for determination of BRAF-V600E 
expression levels in subcutaneous melanoma xenografts with an average 
sensitivity and specificity of 95.6% with 10 s PIRL-MS analysis. This 
proof-of-principle work warrants a future large-scale study to identify a 
metabolite array for 10 s determination of actionable BRAF-V600E mutation in 
human tissue to guide patient care.
