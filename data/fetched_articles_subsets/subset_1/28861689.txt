PURPOSE: There are no data showing a direct correlation between obesity and 
increased blood leptin levels with folliculoma. Moreover, folliculoma is not the 
best studied among other ovarian cancer types. We investigated whether 
oestradiol can modulate ObR expression in some oestrogen-responsive tissues and 
that leptin exerts its activity not only via the leptin receptor but also 
through cross talk with other signalling systems. We hypothesise that blocking 
ObR expression could be a novel treatment for gonadal ovarian cancer.
METHODS: We evaluated the effect of SHLA, Lan1 and Lan2 blockers on cell 
proliferation (BrdU incorporation assay), ObR and ERα/β gene expression (qPCR), 
oestradiol secretion (ELISA) and cell cycle protein expression (Western blot) in 
the non-cancerous cell line HGrC1 and two granulosa cancer cell lines: the 
juvenile form (COV434) and the adult form (KGN).
RESULTS: ObR gene expression in cancer cell lines was 50% higher than in the 
non-cancer cells. Lan-1 and Lan-2 decreased ObR expression in COV434, while it 
had no effect in KGN cells. Higher ERβ expression in non-cancer and higher ERα 
expression in both cancer cell lines was noted. SHLA and Lan-1 changed the ratio 
towards greater expression of ERβ, characteristic of non-cancer granulosa cells. 
All ObR antagonists in HCrC1 and KGN but only Lan-2 in COV434 reversed 
leptin-stimulated proliferation. In both non-cancer and cancer granulosa cells, 
leptin acts as a cyclinD/cdk4, cyclin A/cdk2 and E2F inhibitor.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that SHLA and Lan2 are promising leptin 
receptor inhibitors that can eliminate the negative effects of leptin. These 
compounds should be considered in further ex vivo studies on the cancer 
microenvironment.
