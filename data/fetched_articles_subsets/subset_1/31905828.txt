The opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans relies on cell 
morphological transitions to develop biofilm and invade the host. In the current 
study, we developed new regulatory molecules, which inhibit the morphological 
transition of C. albicans from yeast-form cells to cells forming hyphae. These 
compounds, benzyl α-l-fucopyranoside and benzyl β-d-xylopyranoside, inhibit the 
hyphae formation and adhesion of C. albicans to a polystyrene surface, resulting 
in a reduced biofilm formation. The addition of cAMP to cells treated with 
α-l-fucopyranoside restored the yeast-hyphae switch and the biofilm level to 
that of the untreated control. In the β-d-xylopyranoside treated cells, the 
biofilm level was only partially restored by the addition of cAMP, and these 
cells remained mainly as yeast-form cells.
