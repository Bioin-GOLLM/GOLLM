Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common liver malignancy worldwide, has high 
morbidity and mortality. β-Thujaplicin, a tropolone derivative, has been used in 
some health-care products and clinical adjuvant drugs, but its use for HCC is 
unknown. In this study, we found that β-Thujaplicin inhibits the growth of HCC 
cells, but not normal liver cells, with nanomolar potency. Mechanistically, we 
found that β-Thujaplicin could induce autophagy, as judged by western blot, 
confocal microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Further using 
β-Thujaplicin combined with an autophagy blocker or agonist treatment HepG2 
cells, we found that β-Thujaplicin induced autophagic cell death (ACD) mediated 
by ROS caused inhibition of the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Moreover, 
β-Thujaplicin triggered HepG2 apoptosis and increased cleaved PARP1, cleaved 
caspase-3, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which indicated that β-Thujaplicin induced 
apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial-dependent pathway. We also found that 
increased expression of p21 and decreased expression of CDK7, Cyclin D1, and 
Cyclin A2 participating in β-Thujaplicin caused the S-phase arrest. It seems 
that β-Thujaplicin exerts these functions by ROS-mediated p38/ERK MAPK but not 
by JNK signaling pathway activation. Consistent with in vitro findings, our in 
vivo study verified that β-Thujaplicin treatment significantly reduced HepG2 
tumor xenograft growth. Taken together these findings suggest that β-Thujaplicin 
have an ability of anti-HCC cells and may conducively promote the development of 
novel anti-cancer agents.
