BACKGROUND: Two cytidine analogues, gemcitabine and cytosine arabinoside (AraC), 
are widely used in the treatment of a variety of cancers with a large individual 
variation in response. To identify potential genetic biomarkers associated with 
response to these two drugs, we used a human lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) 
model system with extensive genomic data, including 1.3 million SNPs and 54,000 
basal expression probesets to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
with gemcitabine and AraC IC50 values.
RESULTS: We identified 11 and 27 SNP loci significantly associated with 
gemcitabine and AraC IC50 values, respectively. Eleven candidate genes were 
functionally validated using siRNA knockdown approach in multiple cancer cell 
lines. We also characterized the potential mechanisms of genes by determining 
their influence on the activity of 10 cancer-related signaling pathways using 
reporter gene assays. Most SNPs regulated gene expression in a trans manner, 
except 7 SNPs in the PIGB gene that were significantly associated with both the 
expression of PIGB and gemcitabine cytotoxicity.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that genetic variation might contribute to 
drug response via either cis- or trans- regulation of gene expression. GWAS 
analysis followed by functional pharmacogenomics studies might help identify 
novel biomarkers contributing to variation in response to these two drugs and 
enhance our understanding of underlying mechanisms of drug action.
