Synaptic plasticity has been considered a key mechanism underlying many brain 
functions including learning, memory, and drug addiction. An increase or 
decrease in synaptic activity of the 
Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) complex 
mediates the phenomena as shown in the cellular models of synaptic plasticity, 
long-term potentiation (LTP), and depression (LTD). In particular, protein 
phosphorylation shares the spotlight in expressing the synaptic plasticity. This 
review summarizes the studies on phosphorylation of the AMPAR pore-forming 
subunits and auxiliary proteins including transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory 
proteins (TARPs) and discusses its role in synaptic plasticity.
