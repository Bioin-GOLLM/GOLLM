PEN is an abundant peptide in the brain that has been implicated in the 
regulation of feeding. We identified a receptor for PEN in mouse hypothalamus 
and Neuro2A cells. PEN bound to and activated GPR83, a G protein (heterotrimeric 
guanine nucleotide)-binding protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR). Reduction of GPR83 
expression in mouse brain and Neuro2A cells reduced PEN binding and signaling, 
consistent with GPR83 functioning as the major receptor for PEN. In some brain 
regions, GPR83 colocalized with GPR171, a GPCR that binds the neuropeptide 
bigLEN, another neuropeptide that is involved in feeding and is generated from 
the same precursor protein as is PEN. Coexpression of these two receptors in 
cell lines altered the signaling properties of each receptor, suggesting a 
functional interaction. Our data established PEN as a neuropeptide that binds 
GPR83 and suggested that these two ligand-receptor systems-PEN-GPR83 and 
bigLEN-GPR171-may be functionally coupled in the regulation of feeding.
