Fusobacterium nucleatum is a strictly anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterial species 
that is a member of the commensal flora in the oral cavity and gut. Recent 
studies suggested that the increase of abundance is associated with the 
development of various diseases, among which colorectal cancer is of the biggest 
concerns. Phage therapy is regarded as a potential approach to control the 
number of F. nucleatum, which may contribute to the prevention and treatment of 
related diseases. In this study, we isolated five isolates of bacteriophage 
targeting F. nucleatum. The morphological, biological, genomic and functional 
characteristics of five bacteriophages were investigated. Transmission electron 
microscopy revealed that JD-Fnp1 ~ JD-Fnp5 are all myoviruses. The size of the 
JD-Fnp1 ~ JD-Fnp5 genomes was 180,066 bp (JD-Fnp1), 41,329 bp (JD-Fnp2), 
38,962 bp (JD-Fnp3), 180,231 bp (JD-Fnp4), and 41,353 bp (JD-Fnp5) respectively. 
The biological features including pH and heat stability, host range, growth 
characteristics of JD-Fnp1 ~ JD-Fnp5 displayed different patterns. Among them, 
JD-Fnp4 is considered to have the greatest clinical application value. The 
identification and characterization of JD-Fnp1 ~ JD-Fnp5 provides a basis for 
subsequent therapeutic strategy exploration of F. nucleatum-related diseases.
