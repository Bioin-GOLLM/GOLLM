Tracking the inheritance patterns of proteins (TrIPP) is a live-cell imaging 
technique used for tracking maternal protein segregation patterns between mother 
and daughter cells during asymmetric divisions of budding yeast. We use the 
photo-convertible fluorescent protein Dendra2 fused to a protein of interest 
(POI). Irreversible conversion from green to red fluorescence allows for 
parallel monitoring of old and new proteins for several generations. Single-cell 
quantitative image analysis of time-lapse microscopy gives synthesis and decay 
rates, as well as segregation patterns of the POI. For complete details on the 
use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Auboiron et al. (2021).
