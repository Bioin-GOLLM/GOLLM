The introduction of targeted agents has revolutionized the treatment of chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia but only few patients achieve complete remissions and 
minimal residual disease negativity with ibrutinib monotherapy. This 
multicenter, investigator-initiated phase-II study evaluates a sequential 
treatment with two cycles of bendamustine debulking for patients with a higher 
tumor load, followed by ofatumumab and ibrutinib induction and maintenance 
treatment. An all-comer population, irrespective of prior treatment, physical 
fitness and genetic factors was included. The primary endpoint was the 
investigator assessed overall response rate at the end of induction treatment. 
Of 66 patients enrolled, one patient with early treatment discontinuation was 
excluded from the efficacy analysis as predefined by the protocol. Thirty-nine 
patients (60%) were treatment-naive and 26 patients (40%) had 
relapsed/refractory CLL, 21 patients (32%) had a del(17p) and/or TP53 mutation 
and 45 patients (69%) had an unmutated IGHV status. At the end of the induction, 
60 of 65 patients (92%) responded and 9 (14%) achieved minimal residual disease 
negativity (<10-4) in peripheral blood. No unexpected or cumulative toxicities 
occurred, most common CTC °III/IV adverse events were neutropenias, anaemia, 
infusion-related reactions, and diarrhoea. This sequential treatment of 
bendamustine debulking, followed by ofatumumab and ibrutinib was well tolerated 
without unexpected safety signals and showed a good efficacy with an overall 
response rate of 92%. Ongoing maintenance treatment aims at deeper responses 
with minimal residual disease negativity. However, ibrutinib should still be 
used as a single agent outside clinical trials. Clinicaltrials.gov number: 
NCT02689141.
