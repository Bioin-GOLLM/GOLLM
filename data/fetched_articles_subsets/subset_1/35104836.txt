The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with progressively increased 
transmissibility between humans is a threat to global public health. The Omicron 
variant of SARS-CoV-2 also evades immunity from natural infection or vaccines1, 
but it is unclear whether its exceptional transmissibility is due to immune 
evasion or intrinsic virological properties. Here we compared the replication 
competence and cellular tropism of the wild-type virus and the D614G, 
Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) 
variants in ex vivo explant cultures of human bronchi and lungs. We also 
evaluated the dependence on TMPRSS2 and cathepsins for infection. We show that 
Omicron replicates faster than all other SARS-CoV-2 variants studied in the 
bronchi but less efficiently in the lung parenchyma. All variants of concern 
have similar cellular tropism compared to the wild type. Omicron is more 
dependent on cathepsins than the other variants of concern tested, suggesting 
that the Omicron variant enters cells through a different route compared with 
the other variants. The lower replication competence of Omicron in the human 
lungs may explain the reduced severity of Omicron that is now being reported in 
epidemiological studies, although determinants of severity are multifactorial. 
These findings provide important biological correlates to previous 
epidemiological observations.
