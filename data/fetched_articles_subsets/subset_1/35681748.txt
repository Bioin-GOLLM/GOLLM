Chemoresistance remains the major barrier to effective ovarian cancer treatment. 
The molecular features and associated biological functions of this phenotype 
remain poorly understood. We developed carboplatin-resistant cell line models 
using OVCAR5 and CaOV3 cell lines with the aim of identifying 
chemoresistance-specific molecular features. Chemotaxis and CAM invasion assays 
revealed enhanced migratory and invasive potential in OVCAR5-resistant, compared 
to parental cell lines. Mass spectrometry analysis was used to analyse the 
metabolome and proteome of these cell lines, and was able to separate these 
populations based on their molecular features. It revealed signalling and 
metabolic perturbations in the chemoresistant cell lines. A comparison with the 
proteome of patient-derived primary ovarian cancer cells grown in culture showed 
a shared dysregulation of cytokine and type 1 interferon signalling, potentially 
revealing a common molecular feature of chemoresistance. A comprehensive 
analysis of a larger patient cohort, including advanced in vitro and in vivo 
models, promises to assist with better understanding the molecular mechanisms of 
chemoresistance and the associated enhancement of migration and invasion.
