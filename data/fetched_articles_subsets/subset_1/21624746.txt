BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the airways associated with 
recurrent symptoms that range from mild to debilitating. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) 
is a cytokine that displays pleiotropic effects in asthma and allergy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether polymorphisms of IL-10/IL-10R pathway contribute 
to asthma susceptibility in Egyptian children.
METHODS: The IL-10 (-1082G/A), IL-10R1 (G330R), and signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) rs2293452 single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) were genotyped in 110 atopic children with asthma, 110 non-atopic children 
with asthma, and 110 healthy children. Serum IL-10 and immunoglobulin E (IgE) 
levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: A significant association was observed between the IL-10 polymorphism 
and asthma in both atopic (P = .03) and non-atopic asthma groups (P = .04). The 
genotype frequencies of IL-10R1 polymorphisms did not differ between all groups. 
We identified a significant association between STAT3 polymorphism and asthma 
susceptibility in atopic asthma (P < .001), whereas no such association was 
observed in the non-atopic asthma group (P = .9). No evidence of gene 
interactions was found.
CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms of IL-10 and STAT3 may be useful as a new DNA-based 
diagnostic biomarker for identifying high-risk children susceptible to asthma.
