BACKGROUND: Aggressive brain tumours, whether primary gliomas or secondary 
metastases, are characterised by hypervascularisation and are fatal. Recent 
research has emphasised the crucial involvement of endothelial cells (ECs) in 
all brain tumour genesis and development events, with various patterns and 
underlying mechanisms identified.
MAIN BODY: Here, we highlight recent advances in knowledge about the 
contributions of ECs to brain tumour development, providing a comprehensive 
summary including descriptions of interactions between ECs and tumour cells, the 
heterogeneity of ECs and new models for research on ECs in brain malignancies. 
We also discuss prospects for EC targeting in novel therapeutic approaches.
CONCLUSION: Interventions targeting ECs, as an adjunct to other therapies (e.g. 
immunotherapies, molecular-targeted therapies), have shown promising clinical 
efficacy due to the high degree of vascularisation in brain tumours. Developing 
precise strategies to target tumour-associated vessels based on the 
heterogeneity of ECs is expected to improve anti-vascular efficacy.
