Mannoproteins are non-filamentous glycoproteins localized to the outermost layer 
of the yeast cell wall. The physiological roles of these structural components 
have not been completely elucidated due to the limited availability of 
appropriate tools. As the perturbation of mannoproteins may affect cell 
morphology, we investigated mannoprotein mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae via 
high-dimensional morphological phenotyping. The mannoprotein mutants were 
morphologically classified into seven groups using clustering analysis with 
Gaussian mixture modeling. The pleiotropic phenotypes of cluster I mutant cells 
(ccw12Δ) indicated that CCW12 plays major roles in cell wall organization. 
Cluster II (ccw14Δ, flo11Δ, srl1Δ, and tir3Δ) mutants exhibited altered mother 
cell size and shape. Mutants of cluster III and IV exhibited no or very small 
morphological defects. Cluster V (dse2Δ, egt2Δ, and sun4Δ) consisted of 
endoglucanase mutants with cell separation defects due to incomplete septum 
digestion. The cluster VI mutant cells (ecm33Δ) exhibited perturbation of apical 
bud growth. Cluster VII mutant cells (sag1Δ) exhibited differences in cell size 
and actin organization. Biochemical assays further confirmed the observed 
morphological defects. Further investigations based on various omics data 
indicated that morphological phenotyping is a complementary tool that can help 
with gaining a deeper understanding of the functions of mannoproteins.
