We describe a case of limb-threatening osteomyelitis and metalware infection 
with carbapenemase-producing extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
successfully cured with aggressive surgical debridement and combined intravenous 
fosfomycin and colistin. Real-time therapeutic drug monitoring was used to 
maximize probability of efficacy and minimize potential for toxicity.
