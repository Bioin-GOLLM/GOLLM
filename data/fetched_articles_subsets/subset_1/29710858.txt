Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to 
produce bicarbonate and a proton. Multiple CA isoforms are implicated in a range 
of diseases, including cancer. In solid tumors, continuously dividing cells 
create hypoxic conditions that eventually lead to an acidic microenvironment. 
Hypoxic tumor cells have different mechanisms in place to regulate and adjust 
the surrounding microenvironment for survival. These mechanisms include 
expression of CA isoform IX (CA IX) and XII (CA XII). These enzymes help 
maintain a physiological intracellular pH while simultaneously contributing to 
an acidic extracellular pH, leading to tumor cell survival. Expression of CA IX 
and CA XII has also been shown to promote tumor cell invasion and metastasis. 
This review discusses the characteristics of CA IX and CA XII, their mechanism 
of action, and validates their prospective use as anticancer targets. We discuss 
the current status of small inhibitors that target these isoforms, both 
classical and non-classical, and their future design in order to obtain 
isoform-specificity for CA IX and CA XII. Biologics, such as monoclonal 
antibodies, monoclonal-radionuclide conjugated chimeric antibodies, and 
antibody-small molecule conjugates are also discussed.
