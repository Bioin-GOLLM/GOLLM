Previous reports of children with co-existence of cystic fibrosis and full 
trisomy 21 suggest a very poor prognosis, with the majority of cases dying in 
infancy and the oldest reported survivor being 6 years of age. We report the 
case of a young man with genetically confirmed trisomy 21 and homozygous for the 
F508del cystic fibrosis mutation. Despite the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis being 
delayed until the age of 2 years he has transitioned to adult services and is 
now 25 years of age. Currently he has poor lung function and a continuous 
ambulatory oxygen requirement.
