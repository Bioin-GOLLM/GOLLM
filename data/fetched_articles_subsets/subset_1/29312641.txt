BACKGROUND: To determine if the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) sensitizing mutations improves tumor control and survival outcomes in 
patients with non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received 
definitive thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) with or without chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE for eligible comparative studies 
which compared the outcomes of patients treated with definitive TRT according to 
EGFR mutation status. Meta-analysis was performed using random effects model. 
Outcomes of interest were tumor overall response rate (ORR), loco-regional 
(LRR), distant recurrence rates (DRR), relapse-free survival (RFS), overall 
survival (OS) and adverse events (AE).
RESULTS: We found seven studies including 537 patients with stage III NSCLC. Up 
to 45% of patients in the studies had mutations in exon 19 and 21. Patients 
harbouring EGFR sensitizing mutations had a trend towards improvement in ORR 
(risk ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 0.99-1.37, P = 0.06) compared to EGFR 
wild type status. There were no significant differences in LRR, DRR, RFS, OS and 
AE outcomes between the EGFR mutant and EGFR wild type groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of EGFR sensitizing mutations may improve tumour 
response rate but not survival in patients with localized NSCLC treated with 
definitive thoracic radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy.
