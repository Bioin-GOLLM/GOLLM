We present a 36-year-old Dutch woman who suffered from a progressive form of 
cerebellar ataxia since school age. In her childhood she was diagnosed with 
Friedreich's ataxia. Genetic analysis of the frataxin gene at 34 years of age, 
however, had revealed no abnormal GAA triplet expansion. We identified two point 
mutations in the alpha-tocopherol transport protein (alpha-TTP) gene on 
chromosome 8q13, and the diagnosis ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency 
(AVED) was made. This report illustrates the diagnosis AVED and its relation to 
vitamin E metabolism. It is important to evaluate previously made diagnoses when 
newly developed tests can be performed for confirmation.
