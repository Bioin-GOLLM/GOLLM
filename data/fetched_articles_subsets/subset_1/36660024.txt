INTRODUCTION: Calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) gene 
mutations cause microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH) and 
X-linked intellectual disability. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a rare 
complication reported in only 4 male patients with full loss-of-function 
mutations. Here, we report the first male patient with mosaicism of a truncating 
variant of CASK complicated by CHD.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 6-year-old male with MICPCH, ventricular 
septal defect, and developmental delay. He achieved rolling over but can not 
speak meaningful words. We identified a somatic mosaic variant of CASK: 
c.[725=/G>A], p.(W242*) and high mosaic ratios of 90% and 84% for mutant alleles 
in peripheral blood lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts, respectively. His 
developmental delay was severe but milder than that of previously reported CHD 
patients.
DISCUSSION: Truncating CASK variants may be associated with CHD, even in a 
mosaic state, and even a low normal allele ratio could lengthen survivorship.
