Ultrafast magic angle spinning (MAS) technology and 1H detection have 
dramatically enhanced the sensitivity of solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy of 
biopolymers. We previously showed that, when combined with polarization 
optimized experiments (POE), these advancements enable the simultaneous 
acquisition of multi-dimensional 1H- or 13C-detected experiments using a single 
receiver. Here, we propose a new sub-class within the POE family, namely 
HC-DUMAS, HC-MEIOSIS, and HC-MAeSTOSO, that utilize dual receiver technology for 
the simultaneous detection of 1H and 13C nuclei. We also expand this approach to 
record 1H-, 13C-, and 15N-detected homonuclear 2D spectra simultaneously using 
three independent receivers. The combination of POE and multi-receiver 
technology will further shorten the total experimental time of ssNMR experiments 
for biological solids.
