Single-cell transcriptomics has transformed our ability to characterize cell 
states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing 
of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key 
analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets to better understand 
cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a strategy to "anchor" diverse 
datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only 
across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After 
demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, 
we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences 
in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression 
measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. 
Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing 
transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns. Our work 
presents a strategy for the assembly of harmonized references and transfer of 
information across datasets.
