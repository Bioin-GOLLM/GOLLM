IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is a primary glomerulonephritis problem worldwide that 
develops mainly in the 2nd and 3rd decade of life and reaches end-stage kidney 
disease after 20 years from the biopsy-proven diagnosis, implying a great 
socio-economic burden. IgAN may occur in a sporadic or familial form. Studies on 
familial IgAN have shown that 66% of asymptomatic relatives carry immunological 
defects such as high IgA serum levels, abnormal spontaneous in vitro production 
of IgA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), high serum levels of 
aberrantly glycosylated IgA1, and an altered PBMC cytokine production profile. 
Recent findings led us to focus our attention on a new perspective to study the 
pathogenesis of this disease, and new studies showed the involvement of factors 
driven by environment, lifestyle or diet that could affect the disease. In this 
review, we describe the results of studies carried out in IgAN patients derived 
from genomic and epigenomic studies. Moreover, we discuss the role of the 
microbiome in the disease. Finally, we suggest a new vision to consider IgA 
Nephropathy as a disease that is not disconnected from the environment in which 
we live but influenced, in addition to the genetic background, also by other 
environmental and behavioral factors that could be useful for developing 
precision nephrology and personalized therapy.
