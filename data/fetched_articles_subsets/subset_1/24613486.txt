Binding of a single-chain Fv antibody to Escherichia coli β-galactosidase 
(β-gal) is known to stabilize the enzyme and activate several inactive point 
mutants, historically called antibody-mediated enzyme formation mutants. To 
understand the nature of this activation, we have determined by electron 
cryo-microscopy the structure of the complex between β-gal and the antibody 
scFv13R4. Our structure localizes the scFv13R4 binding site to the crevice 
between domains 1 and 3 in each β-gal subunit. The mutations that scFv13R4 
counteracts are located between the antibody binding site and the active site of 
β-gal, at one end of the TIM-barrel that forms domain 3 where the substrate 
lactose is hydrolyzed. The mode of binding suggests how scFv stabilizes both the 
active site of β-gal and the tetrameric state.
