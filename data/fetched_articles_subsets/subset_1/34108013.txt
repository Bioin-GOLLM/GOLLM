BACKGROUND: Loop diuretics are commonly used in clinical practice to manage high 
fluid loads and to control fluid balance. In this paper, a novel quantitative 
analysis method for multiple components with a single marker (QAMS) was 
developed for the simultaneous determination of 5 diuretic drugs furosemide, 
torasemide, azosemide, etacrynic acid, and bumetanide, by HPLC. Qualitative 
analysis was performed using relative retention time and ultraviolet (UV) 
spectral similarity as the double indicator. The QAMS method was conducted with 
etacrynic acid as an internal reference substance. The quantities of the other 
four diuretics were calculated by using the relative correction factors for 
etacrynic acid. The quantities of the 5 diuretic drugs were also determined by 
the external standard method (ESM). Chromatographic separation was achieved on a 
Shimadzu HC-C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) using 50 mM potassium dihydrogen 
phosphate (pH adjusted to 4.0 with phosphoric acid) with acetonitrile (64:36, 
v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a column temperature 
of 30 ℃.
RESULTS: Under these conditions, the 5 diuretic drugs were well separated, 
showing linear relationships within certain ranges. The quantitative results 
showed that there was no significant difference between the QAMS and ESM 
methods.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the HPLC-QAMS analytical scheme established in this study 
is a simple, efficient, economical, and accurate method for the quantitative 
evaluation of 5 diuretic drugs.
