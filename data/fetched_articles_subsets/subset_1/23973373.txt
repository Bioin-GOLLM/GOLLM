Renal ciliopathies are a leading cause of kidney failure, but their exact 
etiology is poorly understood. NEK8/NPHP9 is a ciliary kinase associated with 
two renal ciliopathies in humans and mice, nephronophthisis (NPHP) and 
polycystic kidney disease. Here, we identify NEK8 as a key effector of the 
ATR-mediated replication stress response. Cells lacking NEK8 form spontaneous 
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that further accumulate when replication forks 
stall, and they exhibit reduced fork rates, unscheduled origin firing, and 
increased replication fork collapse. NEK8 suppresses DSB formation by limiting 
cyclin A-associated CDK activity. Strikingly, a mutation in NEK8 that is 
associated with renal ciliopathies affects its genome maintenance functions. 
Moreover, kidneys of NEK8 mutant mice accumulate DNA damage, and loss of NEK8 or 
replication stress similarly disrupts renal cell architecture in a 
3D-culture system. Thus, NEK8 is a critical component of the DNA damage response 
that links replication stress with cystic kidney disorders.
