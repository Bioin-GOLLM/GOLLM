Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPRD) is a rare, autosomal-recessive 
condition characterized by mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) and severe, 
progressive, early-onset arthritis due to WISP3 mutations. SED, Stanescu type, 
is a vaguely delineated autosomal-dominant dysplasia of unknown genetic 
etiology. Here, we report three individuals from two unrelated families with 
radiological features similar to PPRD and SED, Stanescu type who share the same 
novel COL2A1 variant and were matched following discussion at an academic 
conference. In the first family, we performed whole-exome sequencing on three 
family members, two of whom have a PPRD-like phenotype, and identified a 
heterozygous variant (c.619G>A, p.Gly207Arg) in both affected individuals. 
Independently, targeted sequencing of the COL2A1 gene in an unrelated proband 
with a similar phenotype identified the same heterozygous variant. We suggest 
that the p.Gly207Arg variant causes a distinct type II collagenopathy with 
features of PPRD and SED, Stanescu type.
