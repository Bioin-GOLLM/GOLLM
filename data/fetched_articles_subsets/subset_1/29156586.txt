Animal venoms represent a valuable source of bioactive peptides that can be 
derived into useful pharmacological tools, or even innovative drugs. In this 
way, the venom of Dendroaspis angusticeps (DA), the Eastern Green Mamba, has 
been intensively studied during recent years. It mainly contains hundreds of 
large toxins from 6 to 9 kDa, each displaying several disulfide bridges. These 
toxins are the main target of venom-based studies due to their valuable 
activities obtained by selectively targeting membrane receptors, such as ion 
channels or G-protein coupled receptors. This study aims to demonstrate that the 
knowledge of venom composition is still limited and that animal venoms contain 
unexpected diversity and surprises. A previous study has shown that Dendroaspis 
angusticeps venom contains not only a cocktail of classical toxins, but also 
small glycosylated peptides. Following this work, a deep exploration of DA 
glycopeptidome by a dual nano liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray 
ionization mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-MS) and Matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses 
was initiated. This study reveals unsuspected structural diversity of compounds 
such as 221 glycopeptides, displaying different glycan structures. Sequence 
alignments underline structural similarities with natriuretic peptides already 
characterized in Elapidae venoms. Finally, the presence of an S-cysteinylation 
and hydroxylation of proline on four glycopeptides, never described to date in 
snake venoms, is also revealed by proteomics and affined by nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) experiments.
