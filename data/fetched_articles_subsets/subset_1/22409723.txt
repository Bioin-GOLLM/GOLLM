A screen for hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 helicase inhibitors revealed that the 
commercial dye thioflavine S was the most potent inhibitor of NS3-catalyzed DNA 
and RNA unwinding in the 827-compound National Cancer Institute Mechanistic Set. 
Thioflavine S and the related dye primuline were separated here into their pure 
components, all of which were oligomers of substituted benzothiazoles. The most 
potent compound (P4), a benzothiazole tetramer, inhibited unwinding >50% at 2 ± 
1 μM, inhibited the subgenomic HCV replicon at 10 μM, and was not toxic at 100 
μM. Because P4 also interacted with DNA, more specific analogues were 
synthesized from the abundant dimeric component of primuline. Some of the 32 
analogues prepared retained ability to inhibit HCV helicase but did not appear 
to interact with DNA. The most potent of these specific helicase inhibitors 
(compound 17) was active against the replicon and inhibited the helicase more 
than 50% at 2.6 ± 1 μM.
