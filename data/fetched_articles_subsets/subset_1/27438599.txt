The predictability of neurocognitive outcomes in patients with traumatic brain 
injury is not straightforward. The extent and nature of recovery in patients 
with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are usually heterogeneous and not 
substantially explained by the commonly known demographic and injury-related 
prognostic factors despite having sustained similar injuries or injury severity. 
Hence, this study evaluated the effects and association of the Brain Derived 
Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) missense mutations in relation to neurocognitive 
performance among patients with mTBI. 48 patients with mTBI were prospectively 
recruited and MRI scans of the brain were performed within an average 10.1 (SD 
4.2) hours post trauma with assessment of their neuropsychological performance 
post full Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) recovery. Neurocognitive assessments were 
repeated again at 6 months follow-up. The paired t-test, Cohen's d effect size 
and repeated measure ANOVA were performed to delineate statistically significant 
differences between the groups [wildtype G allele (Val homozygotes) vs. minor A 
allele (Met carriers)] and their neuropsychological performance across the time 
point (T1 = baseline/ admission vs. T2 = 6th month follow-up). Minor A allele 
carriers in this study generally performed more poorly on neuropsychological 
testing in comparison wildtype G allele group at both time points. Significant 
mean differences were observed among the wildtype group in the domains of memory 
(M = -11.44, SD = 10.0, p = .01, d = 1.22), executive function (M = -11.56, SD = 
11.7, p = .02, d = 1.05) and overall performance (M = -6.89 SD = 5.3, p = .00, d 
= 1.39), while the minor A allele carriers showed significant mean differences 
in the domains of attention (M = -11.0, SD = 13.1, p = .00, d = .86) and overall 
cognitive performance (M = -5.25, SD = 8.1, p = .01, d = .66).The minor A allele 
carriers in comparison to the wildtype G allele group, showed considerably lower 
scores at admission and remained impaired in most domains across the timepoints, 
although delayed signs of recovery were noted to be significant in the domains 
attention and overall cognition. In conclusion, the current study has 
demonstrated the role of the BDNF rs6265 Val66Met polymorphism in influencing 
specific neurocognitive outcomes in patients with mTBI. Findings were more 
detrimentally profound among Met allele carriers.
