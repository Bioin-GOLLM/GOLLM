We investigated the association between DICER1 (rs3742330) and DROSHA (rs10719) 
polymorphisms and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PXG) and related clinical 
phenotypes in a Saudi cohort. In a retrospective case-control study, TaqMan 
real-time, PCR-based genotyping was performed in 340 participants with 246 
controls and 94 PXG cases. The minor (G) allele frequency of rs3742330 in PXG 
(0.03) was significantly different from that in the controls (0.08) and 
protective against PXG (odds ratio (OR) = 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 
0.16-0.92), p = 0.017). Similarly, the rs3742330 genotypes showed a significant 
protective association with PXG in dominant (p = 0.019, OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 
0.15-0.92), over-dominant (p = 0.024, OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.16-0.95), and 
log-additive models (p = 0.017, OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.16-0.92). However, none 
remained significant after an adjustment for age, sex, and multiple testing. 
Rs10719 in DROSHA did not show any significant allelic or genotype association 
with PXG. However, a protective effect of the GA haplotype in DICER1 and DROSHA 
and PXG (p = 0.034) was observed. Both polymorphisms showed no significant 
effect on intraocular pressure and the cup-disk ratio. In conclusion, we report 
a significant genetic association between variant rs3742330 in DICER1, a gene 
involved in miRNA biogenesis, and PXG. Further investigation in a larger group 
of patients of different ethnicities and functional studies are warranted to 
replicate and validate its potential role in PXG.
