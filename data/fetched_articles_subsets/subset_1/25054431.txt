Definitive radiotherapy improves locoregional control and survival in inoperable 
non-small cell lung cancer patients. However, radiation-induced toxicities 
(pneumonitis/esophagitis) are common dose-limiting inflammatory conditions. We 
therefore conducted a pathway-based analysis to identify inflammation-related 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with radiation-induced pneumonitis or 
esophagitis. A total of 11,930 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 
201 stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with definitive 
radiotherapy. Validation was performed in an additional 220 non-small cell lung 
cancer cases. After validation, 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms remained 
significant. A polygenic risk score was generated to summarize the effect from 
validated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Significant improvements in 
discriminative ability were observed when the polygenic risk score was added 
into the clinical/epidemiological variable-based model. We then used 277 
lymphoblastoid cell lines to assess radiation sensitivity and expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) relationships of the identified single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms. Three genes (PRKCE, DDX58, and TNFSF7) were associated with 
radiation sensitivity. We concluded that inflammation-related genetic variants 
could contribute to the development of radiation-induced toxicities.
