In the title compound, C(19)H(17)BrO(4), the dihedral angle between the two 
benzene rings is 82.9 (2)°. The mol-ecular structure is stabilized by an 
intra-molecular C-H⋯O hydrogen bond, which generates an S(7) ring motif. The 
crystal packing is stabilized by C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, which generate two 
centrosymmetic ring systems with R(2) (2)(18) and R(2) (2)(14) graph-set motifs. 
The crystal packing is further stabilized by inter-molecular π-π inter-actions 
[centroid-centroid distance = 3.984 (2) Å].
