Variants in MFSD8 can cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) as well as 
nonsyndromic retinopathy. The mutation spectrum includes mainly missense and 
stop variants, but splice sites and frameshift variants have also been reported. 
To date, apparently synonymous substitutions have not been shown to cause 
MFSD8-associated diseases. We report two closely related subjects from a 
consanguineous Turkish family who presented classical features of NCLs but 
demonstrated marked intrafamilial variability in age at the onset and severity 
of symptoms. In fact, the difference in the onset of first neurologic symptoms 
was 15 years and that of ophthalmologic symptoms was 12 years. One subject 
presented an intellectual disability and a considerable cerebellar ataxia 
syndrome, while the other subject showed no intellectual disability and only a 
mild atactic syndrome. The diagnostic genetic testing of both subjects based on 
genome sequencing prioritized a novel, apparently synonymous variant in MFSD8, 
which was found in homozygosity in both subjects. The variant was not located 
within an integral part of the splice site consensus sequences. However, the 
bioinformatic analyses suggested that the mutant allele is more likely to cause 
exon skipping due to an altered ratio of exonic splice enhancer and silencer 
motifs. Exon skipping was confirmed in vitro by minigene assays and in vivo by 
RNA analysis from patient lymphocytes. The mutant transcript is predicted to 
result in a frameshift and, if translated, in a truncated protein. Synonymous 
variants are often given a low priority in genetic diagnostics because of their 
expected lack of functional impact. This study highlights the importance of 
investigating the impact of synonymous variants on splicing.
