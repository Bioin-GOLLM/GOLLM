BACKGROUND: New drugs for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) are needed because most 
patients undergo rapid disease progression despite surgery and adjuvant therapy 
with mitotane. In this study, we aimed to investigate the in vitro effects of 
different chemotherapy drugs, alone or combined with mitotane, on the viability 
of adrenocortical carcinoma cells.
METHODS: Everolimus, sunitinib, zoledronic acid, imatinib and nilotinib 
cytotoxicity, alone or combined with mitotane were tested on ACC H295R cells in 
monolayer or spheroid cultures using MTS assays and confocal microscopy. 
Moreover, the nilotinib effects were investigated in spheroids cultured from 
patient tumor-derived ACC-T36 cells.
RESULTS: Morphological characterization of H295R cell spheroids using 
histochemistry was performed and showed that dense, homogenously sized, 
multicellular spheroids were obtained. We observed that sunitinib and nilotinib 
alone were equally effective in a monolayer preparation, whereas mitotane was 
the most effective even at a low dose. A combination of sunitinib and mitotane 
was the most effective treatment, with only 23.8% of cells in the monolayer 
remaining viable. Spheroid preparations showed resistance to different drugs, 
although the poor effect produced by mitotane alone was surprising, with a cell 
viability of 84.6% in comparison with 13.1% in monolayer cells. The most 
ineffective drugs in spheroid preparations were everolimus, zoledronic acid and 
imatinib. In both cell types, nilotinib, either alone or in combination with 
mitotane induced more significant cell viability inhibition in monolayer and 
spheroid preparations. In addition, the mechanism of nilotinib activity involves 
the ERK1/2 pathway.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data identified nilotinib as a cytotoxic drug 
that combined with ERK inhibitors deserves to be tested as a novel therapy for 
adrenocortical carcinoma.
