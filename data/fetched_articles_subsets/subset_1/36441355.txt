PURPOSE: This study used cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to analyze the 
prevalence of several maxillary anatomical/accessory structures, as well as 
variations within each type, assessing how accurate diagnosis can minimize the 
risk of intraoperative complications during implantological procedures in the 
oral cavity.
METHODS: 212 CBCT scans of the maxilla were analyzed, captured over a period of 
18 months for surgical planning purposes. The prevalence of posterior superior 
alveolar arteries (PSAA), maxillary sinus septa (MSS), and branches of the 
canalis sinuosus (CS) were evaluated, as were the diameter and location of each 
anatomical structure in horizontal and vertical planes. P < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: PSAAs were observed in 99.1% of cases, the intrasinus type being the 
most frequent; MSS were noted in 15.6% of the sample, mainly in the posterior 
region with sagittal orientation; CS branches were observed in 50% of patients, 
mainly in relation to the incisors and significantly more prevalent among males.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of CBCT significantly increases the possibility of clearly 
identifying these anatomical structures. The differences found between patients 
highlight the importance of carrying out an exhaustive radiological study of the 
individual to prevent complications, such as Schneiderian membrane perforation, 
neurovascular damage or bleeding during surgery.
