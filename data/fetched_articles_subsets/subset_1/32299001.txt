OBJECTIVE: The present investigation tested the association of a novel measure 
of brain activation recorded during a simple motor inhibition task with a GRM8 
genetic locus implicated in risk for substance dependence.
METHODS: 122 European-American adults were genotyped at rs1361995 and evaluated 
against DSM-IV criteria for Alcohol Dependence, Cocaine Dependence, Conduct 
Disorder, and Antisocial Personality Disorder. Also, their brain activity was 
recorded in response to rare, so-called "No-Go" stimuli presented during a 
continuous performance test. Brain activity was quantified with two indices: (1) 
the amplitude of the No-Go P300 electroencephalographic response averaged across 
trials; and (2) the inter-trial variability of the response.
RESULTS: The absence of the minor allele at the candidate locus was associated 
with all of the evaluated diagnoses. In comparison to minor allele carriers, 
major allele homozygotes also demonstrated increased inter-trial variability in 
No-Go P300 response amplitude but no difference in average amplitude.
CONCLUSIONS: GRM8 genotype is associated with Alcohol and Cocaine Dependence as 
well as personality risk factors for dependence. The association may be mediated 
through an inherited instability in brain function that affects cognitive 
control.
SIGNIFICANCE: The present study focuses on a metric and brain mechanism not 
typically considered or theorized in studies of patients with substance use 
disorders.
