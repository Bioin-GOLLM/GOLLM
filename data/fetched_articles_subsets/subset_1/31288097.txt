Candidalysin is a cytolytic peptide toxin secreted by the invasive form of the 
human pathogenic fungus, Candida albicans. Candidalysin is critical for mucosal 
and systemic infections and is a key driver of host cell activation, neutrophil 
recruitment and Type 17 immunity. Candidalysin is regarded as the first true 
classical virulence factor of C. albicans but also triggers protective immune 
responses. This review will discuss how candidalysin was discovered, the 
mechanisms by which this peptide toxin contributes to C. albicans infections, 
and how its discovery has advanced our understanding of fungal pathogenesis and 
disease.
