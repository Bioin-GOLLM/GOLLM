An X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder previously had been reported in only one 
family, associated with a p.D59G mutation in the RAB40AL gene that encodes a 
mitochondrial Ras protein. The three related males described had varying degrees 
of cognitive impairment, sensorineural hearing loss, short stature, dysmorphic 
facies, and other morphological defects.
CONCLUSION: We herein present an unrelated 20-year-old male with similar 
manifestations also with p.D59G in the RAB40AL gene, which supports the 
existence of this condition previously coined as Martin-Probst syndrome (OMIM: 
300519).
