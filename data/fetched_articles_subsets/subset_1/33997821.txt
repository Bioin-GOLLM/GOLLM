Recently, it has become evident that macrophage diversity increases in the liver 
during the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Here, we 
provide a detailed protocol for the analysis of liver macrophage subsets in mice 
with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and early NASH using flow 
cytometry and immunofluorescence (IF). These methods can be used to assess the 
composition and localization of macrophage subsets during NASH. For complete 
details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Daemen et al. 
(2021).
