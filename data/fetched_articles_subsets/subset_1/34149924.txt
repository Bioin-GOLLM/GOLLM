Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in 
the United States, and the vast majority of these malignancies are pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), but there is still a lack of early detection 
biomarkers for PaCa. Unlike linear RNAs, circRNAs form covalently closed 
continuous loops and can act as mammalian gene regulators. They may be 
diagnostic or predictive biomarkers for some tumors, also be novel potential 
therapeutic targets in different diseases. This review focuses on (1) the 
biogenesis of circRNAs, RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and complementary sequences 
of circRNAs; (2) the characteristics of circRNAs which allow them to interact 
with miRNAs; (3) the roles of circRNAs playing in the regulation of gene 
expression, cell behavior and cancer, and their potential role as novel 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer.
