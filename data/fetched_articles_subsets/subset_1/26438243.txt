BACKGROUND: Recombinant protein production using Escherichia coli as expression 
host is highly efficient, however, it also induces strong host cell metabolic 
burden. Energy and biomass precursors are withdrawn from the host's metabolism 
as they are required for plasmid replication, heterologous gene expression and 
protein production. Rare codons in a heterologous gene may be a further 
drawback. This study aims to investigate the influence of particular silent 
codon exchanges within a heterologous gene on host cell metabolic activity. 
Silent mutations were introduced into the coding sequence of a model protein to 
introduce all synonymous arginine or leucine codons at two randomly defined 
positions, as well as substitutions leading to identical amino acid exchanges 
with different synonymous codons. The respective E. coli clones were compared 
during cultivation in a mineral autoinduction medium using specialized online 
and offline measuring techniques to quantitatively analyze effects on 
respiration, biomass and protein production, as well as on carbon source 
consumption, plasmid copy number, intracellular nucleobases and mRNA content of 
each clone.
RESULTS: Host stain metabolic burden correlates with recombinant protein 
production. Upon heterologous gene expression, tremendous differences in 
respiration, biomass and protein production were observed. According to their 
different respiration activity the E. coli clones could be classified into two 
groups, Type A and Type B. Type A clones tended to higher product formation, 
Type B clones showed stronger biomass formation. Whereas codon usage and 
intracellular nucleobases had no influence on the Type-A-Type-B-behavior, 
plasmid copy number, mRNA content and carbon source consumption strongly 
differed between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Particular silent codon exchanges in a heterologous gene sequence 
led to differences in initial growth of Type A and Type B clones. Thus, the 
biomass concentration at the time point of induction varied. In consequence, not 
only plasmid copy number and expression levels differed between the two groups, 
but also the kinetics of lactose and glycerol consumption. Even though the 
underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet identified we observed the 
astonishing phenomenon that particular silent codon exchanges within a 
heterologous gene tremendously affect host cell metabolism and recombinant 
protein production. This could have great impact on codon optimization of 
heterologous genes, screening procedures for improved variants, and 
biotechnological protein production processes.
