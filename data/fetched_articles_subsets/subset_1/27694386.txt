Amplified and/or mutated MET can act as both a primary oncogenic driver and as a 
promoter of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance in non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). However, the landscape of MET-specific targeting agents remains 
underdeveloped, and understanding of mechanisms of resistance to MET TKIs is 
limited. Here, we present a case of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring 
both a mutation in EGFR and an amplification of MET, who after progression on 
erlotinib responded dramatically to combined MET and EGFR inhibition with 
savolitinib and osimertinib. When resistance developed to this combination, a 
new MET kinase domain mutation, D1228V, was detected. Our in vitro findings 
demonstrate that METD1228V induces resistance to type I MET TKIs through 
impaired drug binding, while sensitivity to type II MET TKIs is maintained. 
Based on these findings, the patient was treated with erlotinib combined with 
cabozantinib, a type II MET inhibitor, and exhibited a response.
SIGNIFICANCE: With several structurally distinct MET inhibitors undergoing 
development for treatment of NSCLC, it is critical to identify mechanism-based 
therapies for drug resistance. We demonstrate that an acquired METD1228V 
mutation mediates resistance to type I, but not type II, MET inhibitors, having 
therapeutic implications for the clinical use of sequential MET inhibitors.
