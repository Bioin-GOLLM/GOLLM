BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking, a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), is 
known to modify DNA methylation. We hypothesized that tobacco smoking modifies 
methylation of the genes identified for CAD by genome-wide association study 
(GWAS).
RESULTS: We selected genomic regions based on 150 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in the largest GWAS on CAD. We investigated the 
association between current smoking and the CpG sites within and near these 
CAD-related genes. Methylation was measured with the Illumina Human Methylation 
450K array in whole blood of 724 Caucasian subjects from the Rotterdam Study, a 
Dutch population based cohort study. A total of 3669 CpG sites within 169 
CAD-related genes were studied for association with current compared to never 
smoking. Fifteen CpG sites were significantly associated after correction for 
multiple testing (Bonferroni-corrected p value <1.4 Ã— 10(-5)). These sites were 
located in the genes TERT, SARS, GNGT2, SMG6, SKI, TOM1L2, SIPA1, MRAS, CDKN1A, 
LRRC2, FES and RPH3A. In 12 sites, current smoking was associated with a 1.2 to 
2.4 % lower methylation compared to never smoking; and in three sites, it was 
associated with a 1.2 to 1.8 % higher methylation. The effect estimates were 
lower in 10 of the 15 CpG sites when comparing current to former smoking. One 
CpG site, cg05603985 (SKI), was found to be associated with expression of nearby 
CAD-related gene PRKCZ.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests an effect of tobacco smoking on DNA methylation 
of CAD-related genes and thus provides novel insights in the pathways that link 
tobacco smoking to risk of CAD.
