The heterogeneous and invasive nature of pediatric gliomas poses significant 
treatment challenges, highlighting the importance of identifying novel 
chemotherapeutic targets. Recently, recurrent Fibroblast growth factor receptor 
1 (FGFR1) mutations in pediatric gliomas have been reported. Here, we explored 
the clinical relevance of FGFR1 expression, cell migration in low and high grade 
pediatric gliomas and the role of FGFR1 in cell migration/invasion as a 
potential chemotherapeutic target. A high density tissue microarray (TMA) was 
used to investigate associations between FGFR1 and activated phosphorylated 
FGFR1 (pFGFR1) expression and various clinicopathologic parameters. Expression 
of FGFR1 and pFGFR1 were measured by immunofluorescence and by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 3D spheroids in five rare patient-derived 
pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) and two established high-grade glioma (pHGG) 
cell lines. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) migration assays 
were performed for migration and inhibitor studies with three FGFR1 inhibitors. 
High FGFR1 expression was associated with age, malignancy, tumor location and 
tumor grade among astrocytomas. Membranous pFGFR1 was associated with malignancy 
and tumor grade. All glioma cell lines exhibited varying levels of FGFR1 and 
pFGFR1 expression and migratory phenotypes. There were significant 
anti-migratory effects on the pHGG cell lines with inhibitor treatment and 
anti-migratory or pro-migratory responses to FGFR1 inhibition in the pLGGs. Our 
findings support further research to target FGFR1 signaling in pediatric 
gliomas.
