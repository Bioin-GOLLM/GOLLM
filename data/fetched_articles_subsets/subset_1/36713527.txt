Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a malignant tumor with high malignancy that is 
difficult to diagnose and treat. PC is a major medical problem because of its 
low early diagnosis rate, high surgical mortality rate, low cure rate, and 
expensive related testing cost. Therefore, the significance of finding new 
markers for PC is self-evident. Semaphorins (Semas) have been shown to affect 
angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and can also directly affect the behavior of 
tumor cells. The expression and related action targets of its family members on 
PC are summarized in this review.
