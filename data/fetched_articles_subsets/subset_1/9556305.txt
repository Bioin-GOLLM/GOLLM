Open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a highly prevalent cause of visual impairment. Six 
families grouping 71 living patients affected with juvenile-onset and middle-age 
POAG (age at diagnosis ranging from 10 to 65 years) were linked to the GLC1A 
locus. All patients carried a mutation of an evolutionarily conserved asparagine 
residue to a lysine at position 480 (N480K) in the olfactomedin-homology domain, 
which is encoded by the third exon of the GLC1A gene. The N480K mutation was 
also identified in 14 unaffected carriers who are at high risk of developing 
POAG. Although four of the families had ancestors identified in Northern France, 
the pedigrees could not be interconnected by genealogical investigation. 
However, haplotype analysis indicated that all the carriers had inherited the 
N480K mutation from the same founder. Screening of a selected set of 67 POAG 
patients who originated from Northern France and underwent trabeculectomy before 
the age of 50, detected one patient with the N480K mutation associated with the 
same disease haplotype already characterized in the 6 families. This group of 72 
POAG patients is the largest one having a GLC1A mutation in common and provides 
a unique tool to investigate the factors influencing the variable expressivity 
of the GLC1A gene.
