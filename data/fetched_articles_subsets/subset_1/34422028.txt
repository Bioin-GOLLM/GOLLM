MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were treated with coronary artery ligation 
to generate an MI model, followed by treatment for 3 weeks with NOB (50 mg/kg/d) 
or vehicle (50 mg/kg/d), with or without the peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor gamma (PPARγ) inhibitor T0070907 (1 mg/kg/d). Cardiac function 
(echocardiography, survival rate, Evans blue, and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride 
staining), fibrosis (Masson's trichrome staining, quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blot (WB)), hypertrophy 
(haematoxylin-eosin staining, wheat germ agglutinin staining, and qRT-PCR), and 
apoptosis (WB and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling 
(TUNEL) staining) were evaluated. Hypoxia-induced apoptosis (TUNEL, WB) and 
phenylephrine- (PE-) induced pathological hypertrophy (immunofluorescence 
staining, qRT-PCR) models were established in primary neonatal rat ventricular 
myocytes (NRVMs). The effects of NOB with or without T0070907 were examined for 
the expression of PPARγ and PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) by WB in mice and 
NRVMs. The potential downstream effectors of PPARγ were further analyzed by WB 
in mice.
RESULTS: Following MI in mice, NOB intervention enhanced cardiac function across 
three predominant dimensions of pathological cardiac remodeling, which reflected 
in decreasing cardiac fibrosis, apoptosis, and hypertrophy decompensation. NOB 
intervention also alleviated apoptosis and hypertrophy in NRVMs. NOB 
intervention upregulated PPARγ and PGC1α in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the 
PPARγ inhibitor abolished the protective effects of NOB against pathological 
cardiac remodeling during the progression from MI to CHF. The potential 
downstream effectors of PPARγ were nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 
(Nrf-2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that NOB alleviates pathological cardiac 
remodeling after MI via PPARγ and PGC1α upregulation.
