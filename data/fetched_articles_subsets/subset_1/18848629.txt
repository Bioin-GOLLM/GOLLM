Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) allow researchers to measure 
calcium dynamics in specific targeted locations within living cells. Such 
indicators enable dissection of the spatial and temporal control of calcium 
signaling processes. Here we review recent progress in the development of GECIs, 
highlighting which indicators are most appropriate for measuring calcium in 
specific organelles and localized domains in mammalian tissue culture cells. An 
overview of recent approaches that have been undertaken to ensure that the GECIs 
are minimally perturbed by the cellular environment is provided. Additionally, 
the procedures for introducing GECIs into mammalian cells, conducting calcium 
imaging experiments, and analyzing data are discussed. Because 
organelle-targeted indicators often pose an additional challenge, we underscore 
strategies for calibrating GECIs in these locations.
