Genomes of four tick-borne encephalitis virus strains, isolated from the blood 
of the individuals after tick bites and causing no clinical symptoms of 
infection, were characterized. Analysis of translated polypeptides revealed 21 
amino acid positions typical of this group of strains and distinguishing them 
from the other tickborne encephalitis virus strains of Far Eastern subtype 
examined earlier. Only three mutations led to substantial amino acid changes, 
which probably could affect the infection process severity. It is suggested that 
two associated mutations, deletion of amino acid 111 in the capsid protein C and 
substitution (Ser1534 --> Phe) in the NS3 protein influence strictly coordinated 
polyprotein processing, disturbing correct arrangement of viral particles. This 
process can result in the development of defect viral particles, containing no 
RNA. Mutation (Ser917 --> Gly) in nonstructural protein NS1 results in the 
substitution of hydrophilic amino acid, specific to highly virulent strains, by 
the hydrophobic one. This could influence the effectiveness of viral replication 
complex, thereby affecting the infectivity of tick-borne encephalitis virus 
strains.
