A deficiency of adenylosuccinate lyase (ASDL) is characterised by the 
accumulation of SAICAriboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado) in body 
fluids. The severity of the clinical presentation correlates with a low 
S-Ado/SAICAr ratio in body fluids. We report the first British case of ADSL 
deficiency. The patient presented at 14 days with a progressive neonatal 
encephalopathy and seizures. There was marked axial and peripheral hypotonia. 
Brain MRI showed widespread white matter changes. She died at 4 weeks of age. 
Concentrations of SAICAr and SAdo were markedly elevated in urine, plasma and 
CSF and the SAdo/SAICAr ratio was low, consistent with the severe phenotype. The 
patient was compound heterozygous for 2 novel ADSL mutations; c.9 G>C (A3P) and 
c.572 C>T (R190X).
