The synaptic insertion or removal of AMPA receptors (AMPAR) plays critical roles 
in the regulation of synaptic activity reflected in the expression of long-term 
potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). The cellular events 
underlying this important process in learning and memory are still being 
revealed. Here we describe and characterize the AAA+ ATPase Thorase, which 
regulates the expression of surface AMPAR. In an ATPase-dependent manner Thorase 
mediates the internalization of AMPAR by disassembling the AMPAR-GRIP1 complex. 
Following genetic deletion of Thorase, the internalization of AMPAR is 
substantially reduced, leading to increased amplitudes of miniature excitatory 
postsynaptic currents, enhancement of LTP, and elimination of LTD. These 
molecular events are expressed as deficits in learning and memory in Thorase 
null mice. This study identifies an AAA+ ATPase that plays a critical role in 
regulating the surface expression of AMPAR and thereby regulates synaptic 
plasticity and learning and memory.
