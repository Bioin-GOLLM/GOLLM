We describe the development, optimization, and validation of 384-well growth 
inhibition assays for six patient-derived melanoma cell lines (PDMCLs), three 
wild type (WT) for BRAF and three with V600E-BRAF mutations. We conducted a 
pilot drug combination (DC) high-throughput screening (HTS) of 45 pairwise 4Ã—4 
DC matrices prepared from 10 drugs in the PDMCL assays: two B-Raf inhibitors 
(BRAFi), a MEK inhibitor (MEKi), and a methylation agent approved for melanoma; 
cytotoxic topoisomerase II and DNA methyltransferase chemotherapies; and drugs 
targeting the base excision DNA repair enzyme APE1 (apurinic/apyrimidinic 
endonuclease-1/redox effector factor-1), SRC family tyrosine kinases, the heat 
shock protein 90 (HSP90) molecular chaperone, and histone deacetylases.Pairwise 
DCs between dasatinib and three drugs approved for melanoma therapy-dabrafenib, 
vemurafenib, or trametinib-were flagged as synergistic in PDMCLs. Exposure to 
fixed DC ratios of the SRC inhibitor dasatinib with the BRAFis or MEKis 
interacted synergistically to increase PDMCL sensitivity to growth inhibition 
and enhance cytotoxicity independently of PDMCL BRAF status. These DCs 
synergistically inhibited the growth of mouse melanoma cell lines that either 
were dabrafenib-sensitive or had acquired resistance to dabrafenib with cross 
resistance to vemurafenib, trametinib, and dasatinib. Dasatinib DCs with 
dabrafenib, vemurafenib, or trametinib activated apoptosis and increased cell 
death in melanoma cells independently of their BRAF status or their drug 
resistance phenotypes. These preclinical in vitro studies provide a data-driven 
rationale for the further investigation of DCs between dasatinib and BRAFis or 
MEKis as candidates for melanoma combination therapies with the potential to 
improve outcomes and/or prevent or delay the emergence of disease resistance.
