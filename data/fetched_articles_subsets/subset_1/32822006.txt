Despite various clinical modalities available for patients, heart disease 
remains among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Genetic 
medicine, particularly mRNA, has broad potential as a therapeutic. More 
specifically, mRNA-based protein delivery has been used in the fields of cancer 
and vaccination, but recent changes to the structural composition of mRNA have 
led the scientific community to swiftly embrace it as a new drug to deliver 
missing genes to injured myocardium and many other organs. Modified mRNA 
(modRNA)-based gene delivery features transient but potent protein translation 
and low immunogenicity, with minimal risk of insertional mutagenesis. In this 
review, we compared and listed the advantages of modRNA over traditional vectors 
for cardiac therapy, with particular focus on using modRNA therapy in cardiac 
repair. We present a comprehensive overview of modRNA's role in cardiomyocyte 
(CM) proliferation, cardiac vascularization, and prevention of cardiac 
apoptosis. We also emphasize recent advances in modRNA delivery strategies and 
discuss the challenges for its clinical translation.
