The European Commision (EC) recently approved osimertinib for the treatment of 
adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) harboring EGFR T790M mutations. Besides tissue-based testing, blood 
samples containing cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be used to 
interrogate T790M status. Herein, we describe the conditions and results of a 
round robin trial (RRT) for T790M mutation testing in NSCLC tissue specimens and 
peripheral blood samples spiked with cell line DNA mimicking tumor-derived 
ctDNA. The underlying objectives of this two-staged external quality assessment 
(EQA) approach were (a) to evaluate the accuracy of T790M mutations testing 
across multiple centers and (b) to investigate if a liquid biopsy-based testing 
for T790M mutations in spiked blood samples is feasible in routine diagnostic. 
Based on a successfully completed internal phase I RRT, an open RRT for EGFR 
T790M mutation testing in tumor tissue and blood samples was initiated. In 
total, 48 pathology centers participated in the EQA. Of these, 47 (97.9%) 
centers submitted their analyses within the pre-defined time frame and 44 
(tissue), respectively, 40 (plasma) successfully passed the test. The overall 
success rates in the RRT phase II were 91.7% (tissue) and 83.3% (blood), 
respectively. Thirty-eight out of 48 participants (79.2%) successfully passed 
both parts of the RRT. The RRT for blood-based EGFR testing initiated in Germany 
is, to the best of our knowledge, the first of his kind in Europe. In summary, 
our results demonstrate that blood-based genotyping for EGFR resistance 
mutations can be successfully integrated in routine molecular diagnostics 
complementing the array of molecular methods already available at pathology 
centers in Germany.
