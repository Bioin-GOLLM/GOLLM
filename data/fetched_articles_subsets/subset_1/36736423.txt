Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is challenging to treat due to its heterogeneity, 
prompting a deep understanding of its pathogenesis mechanisms, diagnosis, and 
treatment. Here, we found reduced expression and acetylation levels of WISP2 in 
bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients and that AML patients with lower 
WISP2 expression tended to have reduced survival. At the functional level, 
overexpression of WISP2 in leukemia cells (HL-60 and Kasumi-1) suppressed cell 
proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and exerted antileukemic effects in an 
in vivo model of AML. Our mechanistic investigation demonstrated that WISP2 
deacetylation was regulated by the deacetylase histone deacetylase (HDAC)3. In 
addition, we determined that crosstalk between acetylation and ubiquitination 
was involved in the modulation of WISP2 expression in AML. Deacetylation of 
WISP2 decreased the stability of the WISP2 protein by boosting its 
ubiquitination mediated by NEDD4 and proteasomal degradation. Moreover, pan-HDAC 
inhibitors (valproic acid and trichostatin A) and an HDAC3-specific inhibitor 
(RGFP966) induced WISP2 acetylation at lysine K6 and prevented WISP2 
degradation. This regulation led to inhibition of proliferation and induction of 
apoptosis in AML cells. In summary, our study revealed that WISP2 contributes to 
tumor suppression in AML, which provided an experimental framework for WISP2 as 
a candidate for gene therapy of AML.
