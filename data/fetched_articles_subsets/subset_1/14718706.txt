A form of autosomal recessive spastic ataxia (ARSACS) has been described in the 
Charlevoix and Saguenay regions of Quebec. So far a frameshift and a nonsense 
mutation have been identified in the SACS gene. The authors report a new 
mutation (1859insC), leading to a frameshift with a premature termination of the 
gene product sacsin, in two sisters from consanguineous parents. The phenotype 
is similar to previously described patients with ARSACS.
