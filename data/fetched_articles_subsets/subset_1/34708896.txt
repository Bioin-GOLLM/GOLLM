INTRODUCTION: In several countries, molecular diagnosis of haemophilia A (HA) 
and B (HB) is hampered by a lack of resources for DNA analysis. The advent of 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled gene analysis at a reasonable cost.
AIM: Describe a collaboration between Cuban and Spanish researchers to identify 
candidate variants and investigate the molecular epidemiology of 106 Cuban 
haemophilia patients using NGS.
PATIENTS/METHODS: The molecular analysis protocol included well-established 
LR-PCR procedures to detect F8 inversions, NGS with a 30-gene panel to sequence 
F8 and F9, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to identify 
large structural variants.
RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-one candidate variants were identified along F8, 
F9, and VWF; 72 were unique and 28 (39%) had not been previously recorded. 
Putative variants were identified in 105/106 patients. Molecular 
characterization enabled confirmation and reclassification of: 90 HA (85%), 15 
HB (14%), and one type 2N VWD (1%). Null variants leading to non-production of 
FVIII or FIX were common in severe HA (64%), moderate HA (74%), and severe HB 
(60%), whereas missense variants were frequent in mild HA (57%) and moderate or 
mild HB (83%). Additional variants in VWF were identified in 16 patients.
CONCLUSION: This is the first description of the molecular epidemiology of HA 
and HB in Cuba. Variants identified in index cases will be of value for local 
implementation of familial studies and prenatal diagnosis using the molecular 
approaches available in Cuba. The results of this protocolled genetic study 
improved the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis and will facilitate management 
of these patients.
