Despite treatment with intensive chemotherapy, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) 
remains an aggressive malignancy with a dismal outcome in most patients. We 
found that AML cells exhibit an unusually rapid accumulation of the repressive 
histone mark H3K27me3 on nascent DNA. In cell lines, primary cells and xenograft 
mouse models, inhibition of the H3K27 histone methyltransferase EZH2 to 
decondense the H3K27me3-marked chromatin of AML cells enhanced chromatin 
accessibility and chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, apoptosis, and leukemia 
suppression. These effects were further promoted when chromatin decondensation 
of AML cells was induced upon S-phase entry after release from a transient G1 
arrest mediated by CDK4/6 inhibition. In the p53-null KG-1 and THP-1 AML cell 
lines, EZH2 inhibitor and doxorubicin cotreatment induced transcriptional 
reprogramming that was, in part, dependent on derepression of H3K27me3-marked 
gene promoters and led to increased expression of cell death-promoting and 
growth-inhibitory genes.In conclusion, decondensing H3K27me3-marked chromatin by 
EZH2 inhibition represents a promising approach to improve the efficacy of 
DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents in patients with AML. This strategy might allow 
for a lowering of chemotherapy doses, with a consequent reduction of 
treatment-related side effects in elderly patients with AML or those with 
significant comorbidities. SIGNIFICANCE: Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 
renders DNA of AML cells more accessible to cytotoxic agents, facilitating 
leukemia suppression with reduced doses of chemotherapy.See related commentary
