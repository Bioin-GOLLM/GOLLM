Although macroautophagy is known to be an essential degradative process whereby 
autophagosomes mediate the engulfment and delivery of cytoplasmic components 
into lysosomes, the lipid changes underlying autophagosomal membrane dynamics 
are undetermined. Here, we show that phospholipase D1 (PLD1), which is primarily 
associated with the endosomal system, partially relocalizes to the outer 
membrane of autophagosome-like structures upon nutrient starvation. The 
localization of PLD1, as well as the starvation-induced increase in PLD 
activity, are altered by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, 
suggesting PLD1 may act downstream of Vps34. Pharmacological inhibition of PLD 
and genetic ablation of PLD1 in mouse cells decreased the starvation-induced 
expansion of LC3-positive compartments, consistent with a role of PLD1 in the 
regulation of autophagy. Furthermore, inhibition of PLD results in higher levels 
of Tau and p62 aggregates in organotypic brain slices. Our in vitro and in vivo 
findings establish a role for PLD1 in autophagy.
