The Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2) protein is a key regulator of cell 
proliferation and apoptosis that acts primarily by inhibiting the p53 tumor 
suppressor. Similarly, the PI3-Kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is critical for growth 
factor-mediated cell survival. Additionally, it has been reported that AKT can 
directly phosphorylate and activate MDM2. In this study, we show that IGF-1 
up-regulates MDM2 protein levels in a PI3K/AKT-dependent manner. Inhibition of 
mTOR by rapamycin or expression of a dominant negative eukaryotic initiation 
factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1) mutant protein, as well as ablation of 
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), efficiently abolishes IGF-1-mediated 
up-regulation of MDM2. In addition, we show that rapamycin effectively inhibits 
MDM2 expression and sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy. Taken together, 
this study reveals a novel mechanism by which IGF-1 activates MDM2 via the mTOR 
pathway, and that pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR combined with chemotherapy 
may be more effective in treatment of a subset of cancers harboring increased 
MDM2 activation.
