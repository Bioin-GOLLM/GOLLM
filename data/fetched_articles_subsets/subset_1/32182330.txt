PURPOSE: To investigate the underlying mechanisms for how the mouse Cx50-R205G 
point mutation, a homologue of the human Cx50-R198W mutation that is linked to 
cataract-microcornea syndrome, affects proper lens growth and fiber cell 
differentiation to lead to severe lens phenotypes.
METHODS: EdU labeling, immunostaining, confocal imaging analysis, and primary 
lens epithelial cell culture were performed to characterize the lens epithelial 
cell (LEC) proliferation and fiber cell differentiation in wild-type and 
Cx50-R205G mutant lenses in vivo and in vitro.
RESULTS: The Cx50-R205G mutation severely disrupts the lens size and 
transparency. Heterozygous and homozygous Cx50-R205G mutant and Cx50 knockout 
lenses all show decreased central epithelium proliferation while only the 
homozygous Cx50-R205G mutant lenses display obviously decreased proliferating 
LECs in the germinative zone of neonatal lenses. Cultured Cx50-R205G lens 
epithelial cells reveal predominantly reduced Cx50 gap junction staining but no 
change of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker BiP. The heterozygous 
Cx50-R205G lens fibers show moderately disrupted Cx50 and Cx46 gap junctions 
while the homozygous Cx50-R205G lens fibers have drastically reduced Cx50 and 
Cx46 gap junctions with severely altered fiber cell shape in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: The Cx50-R205G mutation inhibits both central and equatorial lens 
epithelial cell proliferation to cause small lenses. This mutation also disrupts 
the assembly and functions of both Cx50 and Cx46 gap junctions in lens fibers to 
alter fiber cell differentiation and shape to lead to severe lens phenotypes.
