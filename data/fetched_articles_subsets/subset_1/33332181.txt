BACKGROUND: The genomic structure that contributes to the risk of coronary 
artery disease (CAD) can be evaluated as a risk score of multiple variants. 
However, sex differences have not been fully examined in applications of genetic 
risk score (GRS) of CAD.
METHODS: Using data from the UK Biobank, we constructed a CAD-GRS based on all 
known loci, 3 mediating trait-based (blood pressure, lipids, and body mass 
index) subscores, and a genome-wide polygenic risk score based on 1.1 million 
variants. The differences in genetic associations with prevalent and incident 
CAD between men and women were investigated among 317 509 unrelated individuals 
of the European ancestry. We also assessed interactions with sex for 161 
individual loci included in the comprehensive GRS.
RESULTS: For both prevalent and incident CAD, the associations of comprehensive 
and genome-wide GRSs were stronger among men than women. Using a score of 161 
loci, we observed a 2.4Ã— higher risk for incident CAD comparing men with high 
genetic risk to men with low genetic risk but an 80% greater risk comparing 
women with high genetic risk to women with low genetic risk (interaction 
P=0.002). Of the 3 subscores, the blood pressure-associated subscore exhibited 
sex differences (interaction P=0.0004 per SD increase in subscore). Analysis of 
individual variants identified a novel gene-sex interaction at locus 21q22.11.
CONCLUSIONS: Sexual differences in genetic predisposition should be considered 
in future studies of CAD, and GRSs should not be assumed to perform equally well 
in men and women.
