Despite advanced efforts in early diagnosis, aggressive surgical treatment, and 
use of targeted chemotherapies, the prognosis for many cancers is still dismal. 
This emphasizes the necessity to develop new strategies for understanding tumor 
growth and metastasis. Here we use a systems approach that combines mathematical 
modeling and numerical simulation to develop a predictive computational model 
for prostate cancer and its subversion of the bone microenvironment. This model 
simulates metastatic prostate cancer evolution, progressing from normal bone and 
hormone levels to quantifiable diseased states. The simulations clearly 
demonstrate phenomena similar to those found clinically in prostate cancer 
patients. In addition, the major prediction of this model is the existence of 
low and high osteogenic states that are markedly different from one another. The 
existence and potential realization of these steady states appear to be mediated 
by the Wnt signaling pathway and by the effects of PSA on TGF-β, which 
encourages the bone microenvironment to evolve. The model is used to explore 
several potential therapeutic strategies, with some potential drug targets 
showing more promise than others: in particular, completely blocking Wnt and 
greatly increasing DKK-1 had significant positive effects, while blocking RANKL 
did not improve the outcome.
