Two boys presenting with infection-triggered, life-threatening salt-loss and 
hyperkalaemia were published in 1991 in the European Journal of Pediatrics. In 
both boys, the diagnosis of corticosterone methyl oxidase (CMO) deficiency type 
II has been established on the basis of determinations of plasma and urinary 
steroids. We had the opportunity to perform a molecular genetic study in one of 
the two boys. This boy had an elevated plasma 
18-hydroxycorticosterone/aldosterone ratio which is pathognomonic for CMO 
deficiency type II. Sequence analysis of the CYP11B2 gene revealed a homozygous 
single base exchange in codon 185 of CYP11B2 causing an amino acid substitution 
Thr185Ile.
CONCLUSION: A Thr185Ile mutation in the CYP11B2 gene was found in a patient with 
CMO deficiency type II. This mutation may change the secondary structure of the 
enzyme leading to its decreased activity.
