Biomass cookstove food preparation is linked to aero-digestive cancers, mediated 
by ingested and inhaled carcinogens (e.g., heterocyclic amines, and polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons). We investigated the association between gastric 
adenocarcinoma, wood cookstove use, H. pylori CagA infection and risk 
modification by variants in genes that metabolize and affect the internal dose 
of carcinogens. We conducted a population-based, case-control study (814 
incident cases, 1049 controls) in rural Honduras, a high-incidence region with a 
homogeneous diet and endemic H. pylori infection, primarily with the high-risk 
CagA genotype. We investigated factors including wood cookstove use, H. pylori 
CagA serostatus, and 15 variants from 7 metabolizing genes, and the interactions 
between wood stove use and the genetic variants. Male sex (OR 2.0, 1.6-2.6), age 
(OR 1.04, 1.03-1.05), wood cookstove use (OR 2.3, 1.6-3.3), and CagA serostatus 
(OR 3.5, 2.4-5.1) and two SNPs in CYP1B1 (rs1800440 and rs1056836) were 
independently associated with gastric cancer in multivariate analysis. In the 
final multivariate model, a highly significant interaction (OR 3.1, 1.2-7.8) was 
noted between wood cookstove use and the rs1800440 metabolizing genotype, 
highlighting an important gene-environment interaction. Lifetime wood cookstove 
use associates with gastric cancer risk in the high-incidence regions of Central 
America, and the association is dependent on the rs1800440 genotype in CYP1B1. 
H. pylori CagA infection, wood cookstove use and the rs1800440 genotype, all of 
which are highly prevalent, informs who is at greatest risk from biomass 
cookstove use.
