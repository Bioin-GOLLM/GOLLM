Extensive experience from randomized clinical trials demonstrates the efficacy 
of GLP-1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors as monotherapy and in combination with 
metformin and other agents, although reductions in FPG and PPG, and consequently 
A1C, are greater with GLP-1 agonists than with DPP-4 inhibitors. This difference 
may result from the pharmacologic levels of GLP-1 activity that are achieved 
with the GLP-1 agonists and their direct action on the GLP-1 receptor. The GLP-1 
agonists have attributes that would make either of them an appropriate choice in 
the management of all 3 patients in our case studies, while either DPP-4 
inhibitor would be an appropriate choice for Case 1. Differences in dosing, 
administration, safety, and tolerability should be considered.
