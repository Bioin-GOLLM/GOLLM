BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignant tumor in 
southern China and Southeast Asia, but its molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis 
are poorly understood. Our previous work has demonstrated that BCAT1 mRNA is 
over expressed in NPC and knocking down its expression in 5-8F NPC cell line can 
potently inhibit cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. However, the 
mechanism of BCAT1 up-regulation and its functional role in NPC development 
remain to be elucidated yet.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) method was utilized to detect the expression 
of BCAT1 protein in NPC at different pathological stages. The roles of gene 
mutation, DNA amplification and transcription factor c-Myc in regulating BCAT1 
expression were analyzed using PCR-sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR), IHC, ChIP and luciferase reporter system, respectively. The 
functions of BCAT1 in colony formation, cell migration and invasion properties 
were evaluated by RNA interference (RNAi).
RESULTS: The positive rates of BCAT1 protein expression in normal epithelia, 
low-to-moderate grade atypical hyperplasia tissues, high-grade atypical 
hyperplasia tissues and NPC tissues were 23.6% (17/72), 75% (18/24), 88.9% (8/9) 
and 88.8% (71/80), respectively. Only one SNP site in exon1 was detected, and 
42.4% (12/28) of the NPC tissues displayed the amplification of microsatellite 
loci in BCAT1. C-Myc could directly bind to the c-Myc binding site in promoter 
region of BCAT1 and up-regulate its expression. The mRNA and protein of c-Myc 
and BCAT1 were co-expressed in 53.6% (15/28) and 59.1% (13/22) of NPC tissues, 
respectively, and BCAT1 mRNA expression was also down-regulated in c-Myc 
knockdown cell lines. In addition, BCAT1 knockdown cells demonstrated reduced 
proliferation and decreased cell migration and invasion abilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that gene amplification and c-Myc up-regulation 
are responsible for BCAT1 overexpression in primary NPC, and overexpression of 
BCAT1 induces cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The results suggest 
that BCAT1 may be a novel molecular target for the diagnosis and treatment of 
NPC.
