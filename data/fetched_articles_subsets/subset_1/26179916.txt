Endoplasmic reticulum-synthesized membrane proteins traffic through the nuclear 
pore complex (NPC) en route to the inner nuclear membrane (INM). Although many 
membrane proteins pass the NPC by simple diffusion, two yeast proteins, 
ScSrc1/ScHeh1 and ScHeh2, are actively imported. In these proteins, a nuclear 
localization signal (NLS) and an intrinsically disordered linker encode the 
sorting signal for recruiting the transport factors for FG-Nup and 
RanGTP-dependent transport through the NPC. Here we address whether a similar 
import mechanism applies in metazoans. We show that the (putative) NLSs of 
metazoan HsSun2, MmLem2, HsLBR, and HsLap2β are not sufficient to drive nuclear 
accumulation of a membrane protein in yeast, but the NLS from RnPom121 is. This 
NLS of Pom121 adapts a similar fold as the NLS of Heh2 when transport factor 
bound and rescues the subcellular localization and synthetic sickness of 
Heh2ΔNLS mutants. Consistent with the conservation of these NLSs, the NLS and 
linker of Heh2 support INM localization in HEK293T cells. The conserved features 
of the NLSs of ScHeh1, ScHeh2, and RnPom121 and the effective sorting of 
Heh2-derived reporters in human cells suggest that active import is conserved 
but confined to a small subset of INM proteins.
