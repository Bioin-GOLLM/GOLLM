Several studies have shown an association between homocysteine concentration and 
cognitive performance or cerebral white matter lesions. However, variations in 
genes encoding for enzymes and other proteins that play a role in homocysteine 
metabolism have hardly been evaluated in relation to these outcome measures. In 
the population-based Rotterdam Scan Study, we examined the association of seven 
polymorphisms of genes involved in homocysteine metabolism (MTHFR 677C>T, MTHFR 
1298A>C, RFC 80G>A, TC 776C>G, MTR 2756A>G, MTRR 66A>G, and CBS 844ins68) with 
plasma total homocysteine, cognitive performance, and cerebral white matter 
lesions among 1011 non-demented elderly participants. Of all the studied 
polymorphisms, only MTHFR 677C>T was associated with homocysteine concentration. 
No significant relationship was observed for any of the polymorphisms with 
cognitive performance or severity of cerebral white matter lesions.
