OBJECTIVE: ATXN1 encodes the polyglutamine protein ataxin-1, which we have 
demonstrated exerting an immunomodulatory function in the context of central 
nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity, in addition to its classical role in the 
neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). In this study, 
we dissected the contribution of DNA methylation to the regulation of ATXN1 in 
multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: We interrogated a DNA methylation dataset previously generated via 
bisulfate DNA sequencing (BS-seq) in sorted peripheral immune cytotypes (CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD14+ monocytes) isolated from untreated MS 
patients at symptoms onset.
RESULTS: Here, we report that ATXN1 undergoes hypo-methylation at four distinct 
regions upon MS, exclusively in B cells. We also highlight how these 
differentially methylated sites overlap with other regulatory epigenetic marks 
and MS risk variants. Lastly, we employ luciferase assays to assess the 
functionality of these regions, showing that the loss of methylation leads to an 
increase in ATXN1 expression.
INTERPRETATION: Altogether, these findings provide biological insights into 
ataxin-1 regulation in the immune system as well as into the molecular 
mechanisms underlying MS risk.
