p94/calpain 3, a skeletal muscle-specific member of calpain protease family, is 
characterized by apparent Ca(2+)-independence during exhaustive autolysis and 
concomitant proteolysis of non-self substrates. The purpose of our study was to 
comprehensively profile the structural basis of p94 enabling activation in the 
cytosol without an extra Ca(2+). Ca(2+)-dependent p94 mutants were screened 
using "p94-trapping", which is an application of yeast genetic reporter system 
called "proteinase-trapping". Several amino acids were revealed as critical for 
apparent Ca(2+)-independent p94 activity. These results highlight the importance 
of conserved amino acids in domain IIb as well as in the p94-specific IS2 
region.
