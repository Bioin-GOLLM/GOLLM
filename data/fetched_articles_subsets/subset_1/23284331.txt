The title compound, [Tb(NO(3))(3)(C(12)H(16)N(3)O(2))(2)], was prepared from the 
nitroxide radical ligand 
4,4,5,5-tetra-methyl--2-(pyridin-2-yl)-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide and Tb(III) 
nitrate. The Tb(III) ion adopts a doubly-capped square-anti-prismatic 
coord-ination environment defined by three chelating nitrate anions and two 
N,O-bidentate nitronyl nitroxide radical ligands. Weak C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds 
connect the molecules into a three-dimensional framework. The title structure is 
isotypic with the Ho analogue [Li (2012 ▶). Acta Cryst. E68, 550].
