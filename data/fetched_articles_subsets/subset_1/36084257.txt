Ovarian carcinoma (OC) forms outgrowths that extend from the outer surface of an 
afflicted organ into the peritoneum. OC outgrowth formation is poorly understood 
due to the limited availability of cell culture models examining the behavior of 
cells that form outgrowths. Prompted by immunochemical evaluation of 
extracellular matrix (ECM) components in human tissues, laminin and 
collagen-rich ECM-reconstituted cell culture models amenable to studies of cell 
clusters that can form outgrowths are developed. It is demonstrated that ECM 
promotes outgrowth formation in fallopian tube non-ciliated epithelial cells 
(FNE) expressing mutant p53 and various OC cell lines. Outgrowths are initiated 
by cells that underwent outward translocation and retained the ability to 
intercalate into mesothelial cell monolayers. Electron microscopy, optical 
coherence tomography, and small amplitude oscillatory shear experiments reveal 
that increased ECM levels led to increased fibrous network thickness and high 
shear elasticity of the microenvironment. These physical characteristics are 
associated with outgrowth suppression. The low ECM microenvironment mimicks the 
viscoelasticity of malignant peritoneal fluid (ascites) and supports cell 
proliferation, cell translocation, and outgrowth formation. These results 
highlight the importance of the ECM microenvironment in modulating OC growth and 
can provide additional insights into the mode of dissemination of primary and 
recurrent ovarian tumors.
