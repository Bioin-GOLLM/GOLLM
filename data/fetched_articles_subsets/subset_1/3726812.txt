Fibrinogen Seattle II: congenital dysfibrinogenemia with an Arg (A alpha 
16)----his substitution.

Ebert RF, Schreiler WE, Bell WR.

Incubation of fibrinogen Seattle II with thrombin (17 mu/ml) resulted in the 
release of two forms of fibrinopeptide A (FpA) which were resolved by 
high-performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid analysis disclosed that the 
abnormal FpA contained histidine in place of arginine. At lower, approximately 
physiologic thrombin concentrations only half the normal amount of FpA was 
released, and fibrinopeptide B (FpB) release was delayed. The effect of this 
substitution on the time course of fibrinopeptide release is consistent with 
conclusions drawn from other studies on the kinetics of fibrinopeptide release, 
viz., that prior removal of FpA is not required before FpB hydrolysis by 
thrombin, and that optimal rates of FpB release occur after formation of fibrin 
I polymer.
