Assembly of microtubule-associated protein tau into filamentous inclusions 
underlies a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Tau filaments adopt different 
conformations in Alzheimer's and Pick's diseases. Here, we used cryo- and 
immuno- electron microscopy to characterise filaments that were assembled from 
recombinant full-length human tau with four (2N4R) or three (2N3R) 
microtubule-binding repeats in the presence of heparin. 2N4R tau assembles into 
multiple types of filaments, and the structures of three types reveal similar 
'kinked hairpin' folds, in which the second and third repeats pack against each 
other. 2N3R tau filaments are structurally homogeneous, and adopt a dimeric 
core, where the third repeats of two tau molecules pack in a parallel manner. 
The heparin-induced tau filaments differ from those of Alzheimer's or Pick's 
disease, which have larger cores with different repeat compositions. Our results 
illustrate the structural versatility of amyloid filaments, and raise questions 
about the relevance of in vitro assembly.
