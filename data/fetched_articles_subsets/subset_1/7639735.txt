To investigate the mechanism of segregation of mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) 
carrying a pathogenic point mutation in the tRNA(leu(UUR)) gene (A to G at 
position 3243) cytoplasts, derived from a heteroplasmic myoblast clone, were 
fused to rhoo cells to create cybrid cells carrying different proportions of 
mutant and wild-type mtDNAs. Although the individual myoblasts used as fusion 
partners contained predominantly mutant mtDNAs (mean proportion 0.77, range 
0.46-0.94), the majority (56%) of the cybrid clones isolated after growth in 
selective medium were homoplasmic wild-type, indicating preferential replication 
of wild-type mtDNAs. Long-term culture of heteroplasmic cybrid clones in 
non-selective medium produced no change in the mean proportion of wild-type 
mtDNAs but an increase in population variance, consistent with a purely 
stochastic segregation mechanism. These results are at variance with a previous 
report suggesting a replicative advantage for mtDNAs carrying the tRNA(leu3243) 
point mutation.
