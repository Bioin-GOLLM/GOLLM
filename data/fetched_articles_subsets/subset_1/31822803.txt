Secretory carcinoma is a salivary gland tumor with a characteristic chromosomal 
translocation that results in an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. Secretory carcinoma 
shows relatively frequent rates of lymph-node metastasis and tumor recurrence 
and has a characteristic histology. Except for the ETV6 translocation, genomic 
alterations in secretory carcinoma have not been reported. In the present study, 
we characterized the novel recurrent genetic mutations of secretory carcinoma. 
On the basis of histology, immunohistochemistry, and ETV6 gene break-apart 
fluorescence in situ hybridization assays, 22 tumors were classified as 
secretory carcinomas (19 ETV6 translocation-positive and 3 ETV6 
translocation-negative secretory carcinomas) and their clinicopathologic 
characteristics were reviewed. Targeted deep sequencing analyses were performed 
on 20 secretory carcinomas (17 ETV6 translocation-positive and 3 ETV6 
translocation-negative secretory carcinomas) to investigate their genetic 
alterations. The A16V (Câ†’T) mutation in PRSS1, which encodes a cationic 
trypsinogen and has a mutation associated with hereditary pancreatitis and 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma, was observed in 40% (8/20) (7/17 of ETV6 
translocation-positive and 1/3 of ETV6 translocation-negative secretory 
carcinomas). Pathogenic variants of MLH1, MUTYH, and STK11 were also identified. 
Variants of uncertain significance included mutations in KMT5A. These novel 
characteristic genetic alterations may advance current understandings of 
secretory carcinoma tumorigenesis and progression, leading to improved diagnoses 
and treatment strategies.
