Infectious diseases are a major global concern being responsible for high 
morbidity and mortality mainly due to the development and enhancement of 
multidrug-resistant microorganisms exposing the fragility of medicines and 
vaccines commonly used to these treatments. Taking into account the scarcity of 
effective formulation to treat infectious diseases, nanotechnology offers a vast 
possibility of ground-breaking platforms to design new treatment through smart 
nanostructures for drug delivery purposes. Among the available nanosystems, 
mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) stand out due their multifunctionality, 
biocompatibility and tunable properties make them emerging and actual 
nanocarriers for specific and controlled drug release. Considering the high 
demand for diseases prevention and treatment, this review exploits the MSNs 
fabrication and their behavior in biological media besides highlighting the most 
of strategies to explore the wide MSNs functionality as engineered, smart and 
effective controlled drug release nanovehicles for infectious diseases 
treatment. Graphical Abstract Schematic representation of multifunctional 
MSNs-based nanoplatforms for infectious diseases treatment.
