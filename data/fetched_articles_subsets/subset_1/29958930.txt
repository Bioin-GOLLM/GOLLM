Solution-state NMR is an important tool for studying protein structure and 
function. The ability to probe methyl groups has substantially expanded the 
scope of proteins accessible by NMR spectroscopy, including facilitating study 
of proteins and complexes greater than 100 kDa in size. While the toolset for 
studying protein structure and dynamics by NMR continues to grow, a major 
rate-limiting step in these studies is the initial resonance assignments, 
especially for larger (>50 kDa) proteins. In this practical review, we present 
strategies to efficiently isotopically label proteins, delineate NMR pulse 
sequences that can be used to determine methyl resonance assignments in the 
presence and absence of backbone assignments, and outline computational methods 
for NMR data analysis. We use our experiences from assigning methyl resonances 
for the aromatic biosynthetic enzymes tryptophan synthase and chorismate mutase 
to provide advice for all stages of experimental set-up and data analysis.
