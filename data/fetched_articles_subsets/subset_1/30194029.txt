Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurological disease 
characterized by the selective degeneration of motor neurons leading to 
paralysis and immobility. Missense mutations in the gene coding for the 
Cu2+/Zn2+ superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) accounts for 15-20% of familial ALS, and 
mice overexpressing ALS-linked SOD1 mutants have been frequently used as an 
animal model for ALS. Degeneration of motor neurons in ALS progresses in a 
manner called "dying back", in which the degeneration of synapses and axons 
precedes the loss of cell bodies. Phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator 
protein 2 (CRMP2) is implicated in the progression of neuronal/axonal 
degeneration of different etiologies. To evaluate the role of CRMP2 
phosphorylation in ALS pathogenesis, we utilized CRMP2 S522A knock-in 
(CRMP2ki/ki) mice, in which the serine residue 522 was homozygously replaced 
with alanine and thereby making CRMP2 no longer phosphorylatable by CDK5 or 
GSK3B. We found that the CRMP2ki/ki/SOD1G93A mice showed delay in the 
progression of the motor phenotype compared to their SOD1G93-Tg littermates. 
Histological analysis revealed that the CRMP2ki/ki/SOD1G93A mice retained more 
intact axons and NMJs than their SOD1G93A-Tg littermates. These results suggest 
that the phosphorylation of CRMP2 may contribute to the axonal degeneration of 
motor neurons in ALS.
