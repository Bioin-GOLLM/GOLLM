Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is a major form of epidermolysis bullosa and 
may be inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait, with associated 
mutations in the COL7A1 gene. Here, we describe a consanguineous Pakistani 
family with four affected individuals suffering from recessive dystrophic 
epidermolysis bullosa. Exome sequencing of the proband's DNA revealed a 
homozygous missense variant (c.8038G>A:p.Gly2680Ser) in COL7A1 which 
cosegregated with disease in the family. The emergence of this particular 
glycine substitution in patients from diverse ethnic backgrounds such as China, 
United Kingdom, Poland, Iran, and Pakistan indicates that this variant most 
likely constitutes a recurrent mutational hotspot in the COL7A1 gene, rather 
than a germline mutation present at low levels in the general population.
