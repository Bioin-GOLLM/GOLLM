The potential of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as nucleic acid delivery vehicles 
has been demonstrated in recent years, culminating in the emergency use approval 
of LNP-based mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in late 2020. The determination of RNA 
content relative to LNP size can be important to the understanding of efficacy 
and adverse effects. This work presents the first description of a facile and 
rapid analytical method for online, size-dependent RNA payload distribution 
measurement using data from multi-angle light scattering, ultraviolet and 
refractive index detectors following separation of the LNPs by size-exclusion 
chromatography. The analysis was validated by size-based fractionation of the 
LNPs with subsequent offline analysis of the fractions. Four LNPs formulated 
with different PEG-lipids and different lipid compositions were tested. Good 
agreement was observed between the online and offline size-based RNA 
distributions among all four LNPs, demonstrating the utility of the online 
method for LNP-encapsulated RNA in general, and suggesting a means for 
simplified biophysical quantitation of a dosing-related critical quality 
attribute.
