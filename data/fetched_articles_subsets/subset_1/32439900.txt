The electrocardiographic PR interval reflects atrioventricular conduction, and 
is associated with conduction abnormalities, pacemaker implantation, atrial 
fibrillation (AF), and cardiovascular mortality. Here we report a multi-ancestry 
(N = 293,051) genome-wide association meta-analysis for the PR interval, 
discovering 202 loci of which 141 have not previously been reported. Variants at 
identified loci increase the percentage of heritability explained, from 33.5% to 
62.6%. We observe enrichment for cardiac muscle developmental/contractile and 
cytoskeletal genes, highlighting key regulation processes for atrioventricular 
conduction. Additionally, 8 loci not previously reported harbor genes underlying 
inherited arrhythmic syndromes and/or cardiomyopathies suggesting a role for 
these genes in cardiovascular pathology in the general population. We show that 
polygenic predisposition to PR interval duration is an endophenotype for 
cardiovascular disease, including distal conduction disease, AF, and 
atrioventricular pre-excitation. These findings advance our understanding of the 
polygenic basis of cardiac conduction, and the genetic relationship between PR 
interval duration and cardiovascular disease.
