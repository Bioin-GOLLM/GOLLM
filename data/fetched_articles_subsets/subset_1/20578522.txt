Genetic host factor may play an important role in controlling mycobacterial 
infections such as tuberculosis and leprosy. Natural resistance associated 
macrophage protein1 (Nramp1, alias Slc11a1) gene has been suggested to an 
associated gene of the host susceptibility to mycobacterium infection. To 
determine the association of Nramp1/Slc11a1 with tuberculosis and leprosy, we 
analyzed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length 
polymorphisms three variants (D543N, 3'UTR and INT4) of Nramp1/Slc11a1 gene in 
58 tuberculosis patients (mean age, 34.0 +/- 13.1), 42 leprosy patients (mean 
age, 35.0 +/- 14.3) and 198 healthy controls (mean age, 32.0 +/- 12.9) from 
South Sulawesi, Indonesia. We observed an association of INT4 polymorphism with 
paucibacillary type of leprosy (p = 0.032, 1df, OR = 2.975, CI = 1.057-8.373), 
but not to multibacillary type (p = 0.173, 1df, OR = 2.248, CI = 0.682-7.404). 
No significant association was found in the three variants with tuberculosis in 
this population.
