Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an extremely aggressive cancer type 
with a patient median survival of 6-12 months. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
signaling plays an important role in triggering SCLC. In addition, growth 
factor-dependent signals and alpha-, beta-integrin (ITGA, ITGB) heterodimer 
receptors functionally cooperate and integrate their signaling pathways. 
However, the precise role of integrins in EGF receptor (EGFR) activation in SCLC 
remains elusive. Methods: We analyzed human precision-cut lung slices (hPCLS), 
retrospectively collected human lung tissue samples and cell lines by classical 
methods of molecular biology and biochemistry. In addition, we performed 
RNA-sequencing-based transcriptomic analysis in human lung cancer cells and 
human lung tissue samples, as well as high-resolution mass spectrometric 
analysis of the protein cargo from extracellular vesicles (EVs) that were 
isolated from human lung cancer cells. Results: Our results demonstrate that 
non-canonical ITGB2 signaling activates EGFR and RAS/MAPK/ERK signaling in SCLC. 
Further, we identified a novel SCLC gene expression signature consisting of 93 
transcripts that were induced by ITGB2, which may be used for stratification of 
SCLC patients and prognosis prediction of LC patients. We also found a cell-cell 
communication mechanism based on EVs containing ITGB2, which were secreted by 
SCLC cells and induced in control human lung tissue RAS/MAPK/ERK signaling and 
SCLC markers. Conclusions: We uncovered a mechanism of ITGB2-mediated EGFR 
activation in SCLC that explains EGFR-inhibitor resistance independently of EGFR 
mutations, suggesting the development of therapies targeting ITGB2 for patients 
with this extremely aggressive lung cancer type.
