A growing list of common and rare genetic risk variants are being implicated in 
schizophrenia susceptibility. As with other complex genetic disorders most of 
the variance in genetic risk is still to be attributed. What can be learned from 
progress to date? The available data challenges how we conceptualize 
schizophrenia and suggests strong aetiological links with other psychiatric and 
developmental disorders. With the identification of rare copy number risk 
variants implicating specific genes (e.g. VIPR2 and NRXN1) it is increasingly 
possible to investigate molecular aetiology in patient subgroups to establish 
whether schizophrenia represents one or many different disease processes. This 
review summarizes recent research progress and suggests how the tools of modern 
genomics and neuroscience can be applied to best understand this devastating 
disorder.
