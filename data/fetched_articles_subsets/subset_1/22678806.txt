OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of γ-glutamyl hydrolase gene (GGH) 
452C/T genotype and allele frequency in children with acute leukemia (AL) and 
healthy children.
METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 92 children with AL and peripheral blood 
samples from 124 healthy children were obtained to prepare complementary DNAs 
(cDNAs). The cDNAs were analyzed for a GGH 452C/T polymorphism by reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 
(RT-PCR-DGGE) and direct sequencing.
RESULTS: The frequencies of the AL patients with TT, CT and CC genotypes were 
2.2%, 13.0% and 84.8%, and the frequencies of the control children were 1.6%, 
16.9% and 81.5%, respectively. There was no significant difference in GGH 
genotype or T allele frequency between the two groups (P> 0.05). However, the T 
allele frequency in Han Chinese children was significantly different from those 
reported in Japanese, Mexican and African-American populations.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of 452C/T polymorphism of GGH gene in Han Chinese 
children has been determined. The results suggested that an ethnic difference 
may exist.
