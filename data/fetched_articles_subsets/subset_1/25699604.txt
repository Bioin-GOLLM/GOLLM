Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACi) hold considerable therapeutic promise 
as clinical anticancer therapies. However, currently known HDACi exhibit limited 
isoform specificity, off-target activity, and undesirable pharmaceutical 
properties. Thus, HDACi with new chemotypes are needed to overcome these 
limitations. Here, we identify a class of HDACi with a previously undescribed 
benzoylhydrazide scaffold that is selective for the class I HDACs. These 
compounds are competitive inhibitors with a fast-on/slow-off HDAC-binding 
mechanism. We show that the lead compound, UF010, inhibits cancer cell 
proliferation via class I HDAC inhibition. This causes global changes in protein 
acetylation and gene expression, resulting in activation of tumor suppressor 
pathways and concurrent inhibition of several oncogenic pathways. The isotype 
selectivity coupled with interesting biological activities in suppressing tumor 
cell proliferation support further preclinical development of the UF010 class of 
compounds for potential therapeutic applications.
