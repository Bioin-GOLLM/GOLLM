BACKGROUND: Claes-Jensen syndrome is an X-linked inherited intellectual 
disability caused by mutations in the KDM5C gene. Kdm5c is a histone lysine 
demethylase involved in histone modifications and chromatin remodeling. Males 
with hemizygous mutations in KDM5C present with intellectual disability and 
facial dysmorphism, while most heterozygous female carriers are asymptomatic. We 
hypothesized that loss of Kdm5c function may influence other components of the 
epigenomic machinery including DNA methylation in affected patients.
RESULTS: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 7 male patients affected with 
Claes-Jensen syndrome and 56 age- and sex-matched controls identified a specific 
DNA methylation defect (epi-signature) in the peripheral blood of these 
patients, including 1769 individual CpGs and 9 genomic regions. Six healthy 
female carriers showed less pronounced but distinctive changes in the same 
regions enabling their differentiation from both patients and controls. Highly 
specific computational model using the most significant methylation changes 
demonstrated 100% accuracy in differentiating patients, carriers, and controls 
in the training cohort, which was confirmed on a separate cohort of patients and 
carriers. The 100% specificity of this unique epi-signature was further 
confirmed on additional 500 unaffected controls and 600 patients with 
intellectual disability and developmental delay, including other patient cohorts 
with previously described epi-signatures.
CONCLUSION: Peripheral blood epi-signature in Claes-Jensen syndrome can be used 
for molecular diagnosis and carrier identification and assist with 
interpretation of genetic variants of unknown clinical significance in the KDM5C 
gene.
