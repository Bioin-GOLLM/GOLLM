PURPOSE: To evaluate a novel effective procedure utilizing three-column 
reconstruction via a posterior approach with a technique that utilizes an 
arthroscope to visualize the anterior surface of the dura during decompression.
METHODS: A Prospective Study. 80 Osteoporotic vertebral burst fracture patients 
with similar demographic data managed by three-column reconstruction through 
single posterior approach surgery: Pedicle screw fixation, Corpectomy, 
Arthroscope Assisted Transpedicular Decompression (AATD) and Fusion (Mesh 
Cage + Bone grafting). Preoperative and postoperative clinical parameters 
(Visual Analog Score VAS, swestry Disability Index ODI, neurlogy, radiological 
parameters and surgical variables were recorded analysed.
RESULTS: No significant differences in demographic data. Significant improvement 
was noted in VAS (pre-operative, 7.90 ±0.60; final follow-up 2.90 ± 0.54) and 
ODI (preoperative, 77.10 ± 6.96; final follow-up 21.30 ± 6.70). Neurological 
improvement was noted in 74 patients (Frankel grade E) while six patients 
remained non-ambulatory (Frankel grade C). Significant improvement was noted in 
local kyphosis angle (preoperative, 22.14 ± 2.60; postoperative, 10.40 ± 1.40) 
with a 10% loss of correction (2.5 ± 0.90) at final follow-up. Implant failure 
in two patients and proximal junctional failure in two patients managed with 
revision surgery. No iatrogenic dural or nerve injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporotic Burst fracture can be managed with single posterior 
surgery, three-column reconstruction with mesh cage. It provides a significant 
improvement in clinical, radiological and functional outcomes. The arthroscope 
can improve a surgeon's operative field and magnification thereby ensuring 
complete decompression without injuring the dura or spinal cord.
