The aim of this study was to detect effects of bitter orange (Citrus aurantium) 
essential oil, commonly called neroli oil (NO) (0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, and 1.5% 
referred to as NO0 NO0.25, NO0. 05, NO1 and NO1.5, respectively) on growth 
performance output and expression levels of some growth-related genes in the 
muscle tissue and some immune-related genes in the head kidney and pathological 
differences in digestive system organs of common carp Cyprinus carpio. The 
NO0.25 group had a large improvement in growth efficiency at the end of the 
60-day feeding cycle. Real-time PCR (Bio RAD, USA) system was used to detect 
variations in gene expression levels. Furthermore, NO supplementation of up to 
0.25% in muscle tissue controlled the release of growth hormone (GH) and 
insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Furthermore, in the NO0.25 treatment 
category, immune response gene levels TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-1ß increased in head 
kidney tissue. In the histological examination of the liver and intestine, there 
were significant differences between fish fed with N1 and N1.5 diets. This study 
confirms that dietary supplementation of NO up to 0.25% can improve common carp 
growth efficiency and increase the expression of genes (GH and IGF-I) related to 
muscle growth, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-1ß genes related to immune status, and liver 
and intestine histological status of common carp.
