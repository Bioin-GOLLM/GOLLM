The immune system is vital for detecting and evading endogenous and exogenous 
threats to the body. Failure to regulate this homeostasis leads to autoimmunity, 
which is often associated with malfunctioning T cell signaling. Several 
medications are available to suppress over-reactive T lymphocytes, but many of 
the currently marketed drugs produce severe and life-threatening side-effects. 
Ribosomally synthesized peptides are gaining recognition from the pharmaceutical 
industry for their enhanced selectivity and decreased toxicity compared with 
small molecules; in particular, circular peptides exhibit remarkable stability 
and increased oral administration properties. For example, plant cyclotides 
effectively inhibit T lymphocyte proliferation. They are composed of a 
head-to-tail cyclized backbone and a cystine-knot motif, which confers them with 
remarkable stability, thus making them attractive pharmaceutical tools.
