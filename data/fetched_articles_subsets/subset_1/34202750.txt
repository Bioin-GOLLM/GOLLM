In light of recent advancements in machine learning, personalized medicine using 
predictive algorithms serves as an essential paradigmatic methodology. Our goal 
was to explore an integrated machine learning and genome-wide analysis approach 
which targets the prediction of probable major depressive disorder (MDD) using 
9828 individuals in the Taiwan Biobank. In our analysis, we reported a 
genome-wide significant association with probable MDD that has not been 
previously identified: FBN1 on chromosome 15. Furthermore, we pinpointed 17 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which show evidence of both associations 
with probable MDD and potential roles as expression quantitative trait loci 
(eQTLs). To predict the status of probable MDD, we established prediction models 
with random undersampling and synthetic minority oversampling using 17 eQTL SNPs 
and eight clinical variables. We utilized five state-of-the-art models: logistic 
ridge regression, support vector machine, C4.5 decision tree, LogitBoost, and 
random forests. Our data revealed that random forests had the highest 
performance (area under curve = 0.8905 Â± 0.0088; repeated 10-fold 
cross-validation) among the predictive algorithms to infer complex correlations 
between biomarkers and probable MDD. Our study suggests that an integrated 
machine learning and genome-wide analysis approach may offer an advantageous 
method to establish bioinformatics tools for discriminating MDD patients from 
healthy controls.
