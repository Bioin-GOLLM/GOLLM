This study indicates that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can promote 
young cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) to migrate via the 
activation of the BDNF-TrkB-FL-PI3K/Akt pathway, which may benefit angiogenesis 
after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the ageing of CMECs led to changes in 
the expression of receptor Trk isoforms in that among the three isoforms 
(TrkB-FL, TrkB-T1 and TrkB-T2), only one of its truncated isoforms, TrkB-T1, 
continued to be expressed, which leads to the dysfunction of its ligand, a 
decrease in the migration of CMECs and increased injury in ageing hearts. This 
shift in receptor isoforms in aged CMECs, together with changes in the ageing 
microenvironment, might predispose ageing hearts to decreased angiogenic 
potential and increased cardiac pathology.
