MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 22 nt non-coding RNAs that target mRNAs for 
cleavage or translational repression. Numerous miRNAs regulate programmed cell 
death including apoptosis, autophagy and necroptosis. We summarize how miRNAs 
regulate apoptotic, autophagic and necroptotic pathways and cancer progression. 
We also discuss how miRNAs link different types of cell death.
