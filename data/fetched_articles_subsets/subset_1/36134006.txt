We investigate the internal morphology of smart core-shell microgels by 
super-resolution fluorescence microscopy exploiting a combination of 3D single 
molecule localization and structured illumination microscopy utilizing freely 
diffusing fluorescent dyes. This approach does not require any direct chemical 
labeling and does not perturb the network structure of these colloidal gels. 
Hence, it allows us to study the morphology of the particles with very high 
precision. We found that the structure of the core-forming seed particles is 
drastically changed by the second synthesis step necessary for making the shell, 
resulting in a core region with highly increased dye localization density. The 
present work shows that super-resolution microscopy has great potential with 
respect to the study of soft colloidal systems.
