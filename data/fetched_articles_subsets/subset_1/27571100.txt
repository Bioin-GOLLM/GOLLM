The gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only validated treatment for celiac disease 
(CD), but despite strict adherence, complete mucosal recovery is rarely 
obtained. The aim of our study was to assess whether complete restitutio ad 
integrum could be achieved by adopting a restrictive diet (Gluten Contamination 
Elimination Diet, GCED) or may depend on time of exposure to GFD. Two cohorts of 
CD patients, with persisting Marsh II/Grade A lesion at duodenal biopsy after 
12-18 months of GFD (early control) were identified. Patients in Cohort A were 
re-biopsied after a three-month GCED (GCED control) and patients in Cohort B 
were re-biopsied after a minimum of two years on a standard GFD subsequent to 
early control (late control). Ten patients in Cohort A and 19 in Cohort B 
completed the study protocol. There was no change in the classification of 
duodenal biopsies in both cohorts. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, 
TCRγδ+ (T-Cell Receptor gamma delta) T cell and eosinophils significantly 
decreased at GCED control (Cohort A) and at late control (Cohort B), compared to 
early control. Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocytosis persisting in CD patients 
during GFD is not eliminated by a GCED and is independent of the length of GFD.
