BACKGROUND: Pituitary metastases are rare, often deriving from lung or breast 
cancer owing to the upper vena cava proximity. Pituitary metastases can manifest 
with signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors, consequent to mass effect 
(headache, visual impairment) and/or hormonal alterations (hyperprolactinemia, 
hypopituitarism, and diabetes insipidus). Immune checkpoint inhibitors burst 
immunity against tumors, significantly increasing patients' survival, but their 
autoimmune side effects frequently involve the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, 
and the endocrine glands (pituitary, thyroid, pancreas).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old Caucasian man had undergone trans-nasal 
sphenoidal surgery for a nonsecreting pituitary macroadenoma in 2001, without 
remnant or endocrine deficits. In 2016, he was operated for a shoulder melanoma. 
In February 2018, imaging evaluation demonstrated metastases in lung, liver, and 
femur. Therefore, treatment with pembrolizumab (anti-programmed death 1) was 
scheduled in May 2018, but, before starting this therapy, a brain computed 
tomography performed for a sudden loss of consciousness detected a sellar mass 
of 17 × 12 mm, which extended to the pituitary stalk and compressed the optic 
chiasma. Focused magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the size and 
characteristics of the lesion, while emergency evaluation of the hormonal 
profile demonstrated an impairment of adrenal and thyroid function. The 
pituitary lesion demonstrated a remarkable shrinkage (8 × 6 mm), which was 
confirmed by subsequent imaging evaluations.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case reporting on effectiveness of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors in a patient with pituitary metastasis from a melanoma.
