BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to identify the genetic mutations 
profile in Brazilian children with nephrotic syndrome (NS) and to determine a 
genotype-phenotype correlation in this disease.
METHODS: Next-generation sequencing and mutation analysis were performed on 24 
genes related to NS in a cross-sectional study involving 95 children who 
underwent kidney transplantation due to NS, excluding congenital cases.
RESULTS: A total of 149 variants were identified in 22 of 24 sequenced genes. 
The mutations were classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, likely benign 
and benign per the chance of causing the disease. NPHS2 was the most common 
mutated gene. We identified 8 (8.4%) patients with hereditary NS and 5 (5%) 
patients with probably genetically caused NS. COL4A3-5 variants were found as 
well, but it is not clear whether they should be considered isolated FSGS or 
simply a misdiagnosed type of the Alport spectrum. Considering the clinical 
results, hereditary NS patients presented a tendency to early disease onset when 
compared with the other groups (P = 0.06) and time to end stage renal disease 
(ESRD) was longer in this group (P = 0.03). No patients from hereditary NS group 
had NS recurrence after transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in children with steroid-resistant NS who 
underwent kidney transplantation using next-generation sequencing. Considering 
our results, we believe this study has shed some light to the uncertainties of 
genotype-phenotype correlation in NS, where several genes cooperate to produce 
or even to modify the course of the disease.
