Solid-state reaction of organic molecules holds a considerable advantage over 
liquid-phase processes in the manufacturing industry. However, the research 
progress in exploring this benefit is largely staggering, which leaves few 
liquid-phase systems to work with. Here, we show a synthetic protocol for the 
formation of a three-dimensional porous organic network via solid-state 
explosion of organic single crystals. The explosive reaction is realized by the 
Bergman reaction (cycloaromatization) of three enediyne groups on 
2,3,6,7,14,15-hexaethynyl-9,10-dihydro-9,10-[1,2]benzenoanthracene. The origin 
of the explosion is systematically studied using single-crystal X-ray 
diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry, along with high-speed camera 
and density functional theory calculations. The results suggest that the 
solid-state explosion is triggered by an abrupt change in lattice energy induced 
by release of primer molecules in the 
2,3,6,7,14,15-hexaethynyl-9,10-dihydro-9,10-[1,2]benzenoanthracene crystal 
lattice.
