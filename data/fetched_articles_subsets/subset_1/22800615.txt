AIM: P53 plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic stability as well 
as the control of cell growth and apoptosis. Recently, an uncommon P53 genetic 
variant (rs78378222) was reported to be significantly associated with multiple 
cancers in Caucasians in a genome-wide association study. rs78378222 locates in 
the 3'-untranslated region of the P53 gene, and this A-to-C polymorphism results 
in changes of the AATAAA polyadenylation signal to AATACA, which leads to 
impaired 3'-end processing of P53 mRNA and decreased P53 expression.
METHODS: We evaluated the association between this polymorphism and esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk in a case-control cohort consisting of 405 
ESCC patients and 810 healthy controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression.
RESULTS: We did observe this polymorphism with low minor allele frequency in 
Chinese Han population. Additionally, significantly increased ESCC risk was 
associated with P53 rs78378222 A>C polymorphism. Compared with rs78378222AA 
carriers, the OR of developing ESCC for AC carriers was 3.22 (95% CI=1.71-6.33, 
P=1.34×10(-4)).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that this functional uncommon P53 rs78378222 
variant is associated with ESCC risk in the current Han Chinese population.
