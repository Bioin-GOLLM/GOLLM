OBJECTIVES: To investigate the functional effect of implicated variants within 
BGN and COL5A1 on gene expression of components of the extracellular matrix 
(ECM) in a TGF-β-stimulated risk model for musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries.
DESIGN: Experimental research, laboratory study.
METHODS: Skin biopsies were obtained from nine healthy participants with either 
a combined increased or reduced risk profile for COL5A1 rs12722 C>T and BGN 
rs1126499 C>T - rs1042103 G>A, and primary fibroblast cell lines were 
established. Total RNA was extracted at baseline (10% FBS), after serum 
starvation (1% FBS) and TGF-β1 treatment (1% FBS, 10ng/mL TGF-1β). Relative mRNA 
levels of BGN, COL5A1, DCN and VEGFA was quantified using Taqman® array 
pre-spotted plate assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA).
RESULTS: At baseline, the reduced risk group had 2.5, 1.9 and 2 fold increases 
(p<0.001) in relative BGN, COL5A1 and VEGFA mRNA levels respectively. In the 
serum starved experiments, except for a significant 1.5 fold (p=0.017) increase 
in relative DCN mRNA expression in the reduced risk group, similar observations 
were noted for the other three genes. After TGF-1β treatment, the reduced risk 
group had 1.3 (p=0.011) and 1.4 fold (p=0.001) increases in the relative COL5A1 
and VEGFA mRNA levels, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Altered mRNA levels associated with genetic risk profiles for 
musculoskeletal soft injury risk at baseline (BGN, COL5A1 and VEGFA), with serum 
starvation (DCN) and after TGF-β1 treatment (COL5A1 and VEGFA) provide 
additional functional evidence to support the association of implicated genetic 
loci with several musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. Implication of altered 
gene expression profiles underpinning these genetic risk associated loci 
potentially highlight key therapeutic targets for management of these injuries.
