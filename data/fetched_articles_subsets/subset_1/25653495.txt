Potocki-Shaffer syndrome (PSS, OMIM #601224) is a rare contiguous gene deletion 
syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of genes located on the 11p11.2p12. 
Affected individuals have a number of characteristic features including multiple 
exostoses, biparietal foramina, abnormalities of genitourinary system, 
hypotonia, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. We report here on 
the first Korean case of an 8-yr-old boy with PSS diagnosed by high resolution 
microarray. Initial evaluation was done at age 6 months because of a history of 
developmental delay, hypotonia, and dysmorphic face. Coronal craniosynostosis 
and enlarged parietal foramina were found on skull radiographs. At age 6 yr, he 
had severe global developmental delay. Multiple exostoses of long bones were 
detected during a radiological check-up. Based on the clinical and radiological 
features, PSS was highly suspected. Subsequently, chromosomal microarray 
analysis identified an 8.6 Mb deletion at 11p11.2 [arr 11p12p11.2 
(Chr11:39,204,770-47,791,278)Ã—1]. The patient continued rehabilitation therapy 
for profound developmental delay. The progression of multiple exostosis has 
being monitored. This case confirms and extends data on the genetic basis of 
PSS. In clinical and radiologic aspect, a patient with multiple exostoses 
accompanying with syndromic features, including craniofacial abnormalities and 
mental retardation, the diagnosis of PSS should be considered.
