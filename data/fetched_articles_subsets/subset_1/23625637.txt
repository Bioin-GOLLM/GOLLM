OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Mutation of the TP53 gene occurs in more than half of 
cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, little is known 
about how specific TP53 mutations affect tumor progression. The objective of 
this study is to determine the gain of function of mutant p53 with a 
proline-to-serine substitution at codon 151.
STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory-based study.
METHODS: A panel of HNSCC cell lines was determined with anoikis assays, and 
orthotopic mouse experiments were performed. TP53 was sequenced. The shRNA 
knockdown and overexpression approaches were used for testing mutant p53 
functions. The crystal structure of the p53 protein was analyzed using an in 
silico approach.
RESULTS: An anoikis-resistant cell line, Tu138, was found to have a 
proline-to-serine substitution at codon 151 of TP53, which results in loss of 
wild-type p53 transcriptional activity. Moreover, the mutant p53 was shown to 
promote anoikis resistance and soft agar growth. Using an in silico approach 
based on the crystal structure of wild-type p53 protein, substitution of proline 
by serine at position 151 would create a cavity in a hydrophobic pocket, the 
loss of van der Waals contacts, and the thermodynamically unfavorable placement 
of a polar group, the hydroxyl oxygen atom of the serine, within a hydrophobic 
region, all of which likely cause a locally altered structure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that mutation at position 151 leads to a 
structural alteration, which results in significant functional changes in the 
p53 protein that impact tumor progression.
