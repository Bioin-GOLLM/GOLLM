G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been known for decades as attractive 
drug targets. This has led to the development and approval of many ligands 
targeting GPCRs. Although ligand binding effects have been studied thoroughly 
for many GPCRs, there are multiple aspects of GPCR signaling that remain poorly 
understood. The reasons for this are the difficulties that are encountered upon 
studying GPCRs, for example, a poor solubility and low expression levels. In 
this work, we have managed to overcome some of these issues by developing an 
affinity-based probe for a prototypic GPCR, the adenosine A1 receptor (A1AR). 
Here, we show the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of this probe in 
various biochemical assays, such as SDS-PAGE, confocal microscopy, and chemical 
proteomics.
