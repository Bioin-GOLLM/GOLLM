INTRODUCTION: Haemophilia A (HA) and haemophilia B (HB) are X-linked recessive 
diseases, caused by a large number of pathogenic variants in the F8 and F9 
genes. With the exception of introns 22 and 1 inversions which are frequent in 
severe HA cases, about 2000 unique variants in F8 and 1000 in F9 have been 
described in databases and their recurrence remains limited.
AIM AND METHODS: During routine analysis, we identified two recurrent missense 
variants, the F8 gene c.1244C>T, p.Ala415Val variant in 27 HA patients and the 
F9 gene c.835G>A, p.Ala279Thr variant in 34 HB patients, in two groups of 
haemophiliac patients from two different regions of France. We aimed to identify 
whether these variants result from a founder effect. We performed haplotype 
reconstruction after analysis of extragenic and intragenic polymorphic markers. 
The ESTIAGE programme was used to estimate the age of the variant.
RESULTS: We identified a common ancestral haplotype HA1, in all the HA patients 
sharing the p.Ala415Val variant, and HB1 for 22 of 34 HB patients sharing the 
p.Ala279Thr variant. The estimated time of occurrence of the founder variant was 
between the 13th and 17th century (95% CI: 16 to 29 generations) for the F8 
variant and between the 3rd and the 11th century for the F9 variant (95% CI: 44 
to 72 generations).
CONCLUSION: This study supports a founder effect for these two variants in the 
two largest reported cohorts of haemophilia patients with an identical variant. 
These pathogenic variants are among the three most early reported variants in 
haemophilia.
