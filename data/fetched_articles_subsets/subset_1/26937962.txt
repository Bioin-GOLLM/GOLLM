Genetic susceptibility is an important modifier of clinical outcome and natural 
history of progression in Alcoholic liver disease (ALD). While the significance 
of ethnicity in this evolution is very clear, subtle inter-individual genetic 
variant(s) might be important and thus we investigated those in an Indian 
population. Fourteen markers were genotyped within two alcohol metabolism genes 
[Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene clusters (ADH1B and ADH1C) and Aldehyde 
dehydrogenase (ALDH2)], one microsomal ethanol oxidizing enzyme cytochrome p450 
(CYP2E1) and three oxidative stress response (OSR) genes (MnSOD, GSTT1 and 
GSTM1) among 490 Bengali individuals (322 ALD and 168 control) from Eastern and 
North-Eastern India and validation was performed in a new cohort of 150 Bengali 
patients including 100 ALD and 50 advanced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). 
Out of 14 genetic variants, carriage of 5 genotypes (rs2066701CC in ADH1B, 
rs1693425TT in ADH1C, rs4880TT in MnSOD and GSTT1/GSTM1 null, p-value <0.05) 
were noted significantly higher among ALD patients while inter or intra group 
gene-gene interaction analysis revealed that addition of risk genotype of any 
OSR gene enhanced the possibility of ALD synergistically. Multiple logistic 
regression analysis showed independent association of rs2066701CC, rs4880TT and 
GSTM1 null genotype with ALD while lower frequencies of those genotypes in 
advanced NASH patients further confirmed their causal relation to ALD. Thus 
these findings suggest that the three variants of ADH1C, MnSOD and GSTM1 can be 
used to identify individuals who are at high risk to develop ALD and may be 
helpful in proper management of Indian alcoholics.
