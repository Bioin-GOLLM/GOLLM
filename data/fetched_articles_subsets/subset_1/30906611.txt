We present a rare case of transplacental-transmitted maternal melanoma to the 
placenta and foetus during the pregnancy of a 34-year-old woman. She was 
diagnosed with a melanoma at the age of 25, for which she was treated with 
chemotherapy. During her pregnancy, she presented with a recurrence of the 
disease and died 3 months after delivery. The 10-month-old female child 
presented with a recurrent retroauricular oedema on the left side. A 
trephination of mastoid apophysis followed. Multiple fragments of dark-coloured 
tissue were sent for histological examination, and the immunophenotype showed a 
melanocytic tumour in the mastoid. A full radiological assessment showed no sign 
of metastasis. The child remained without treatment. Complete remission of bone 
metastatic lesion has been confirmed by follow-up; now, the child is 4 years 
old, alive, and without evidence of disease.
