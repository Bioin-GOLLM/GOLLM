In excitatory neurons, SCN2A (NaV1.2) and SCN8A (NaV1.6) sodium channels are 
enriched at the axon initial segment. NaV1.6 is implicated in several mouse 
models of absence epilepsy, including a missense mutation identified in a 
chemical mutagenesis screen (Scn8a(V929F)). Here, we confirmed the prior 
suggestion that Scn8a(V929F) exhibits a striking genetic background-dependent 
difference in phenotypic severity, observing that spike-wave discharge (SWD) 
incidence and severity are significantly diminished when Scn8a(V929F) is fully 
placed onto the C57BL/6J strain compared with C3H. Examination of sequence 
differences in NaV subunits between these two inbred strains suggested 
NaV1.2(V752F) as a potential source of this modifier effect. Recognising that 
the spatial co-localisation of the NaV channels at the axon initial segment 
(AIS) provides a plausible mechanism for functional interaction, we tested this 
idea by undertaking biophysical characterisation of the variant NaV channels and 
by computer modelling. NaV1.2(V752F) functional analysis revealed an overall 
gain-of-function and for NaV1.6(V929F) revealed an overall loss-of-function. A 
biophysically realistic computer model was used to test the idea that 
interaction between these variant channels at the AIS contributes to the strain 
background effect. Surprisingly this modelling showed that neuronal excitability 
is dominated by the properties of NaV1.2(V752F) due to "functional silencing" of 
NaV1.6(V929F) suggesting that these variants do not directly interact. 
Consequent genetic mapping of the major strain modifier to Chr 7, and not Chr 2 
where Scn2a maps, supported this biophysical prediction. While a NaV1.6(V929F) 
loss of function clearly underlies absence seizures in this mouse model, the 
strain background effect is apparently not due to an otherwise tempting Scn2a 
variant, highlighting the value of combining physiology and genetics to inform 
and direct each other when interrogating genetic complex traits such as absence 
epilepsy.
