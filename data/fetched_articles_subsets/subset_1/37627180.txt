Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with bone 
marrow (BM) involvement and IgM monoclonal gammopathy. To date, no studies have 
focused specifically on peripheral blood (PB) involvement. In this study, 100 
patients diagnosed with WM according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 
criteria were included based on the demonstration of MYD88mut in BM and the 
availability of PB multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) analysis. Leukemic 
involvement by MFC was detected in 50/100 patients. A low percentage of mature 
small lymphocytes in PB smears was observed in only 15 cases. MYD88mut by 
AS-qPCR was detected in PB in 65/100 cases. In cases with leukemic expression by 
MFC, MYD88mut was detected in all cases, and IGH was rearranged in 44/49 cases. 
In 21/50 patients without PB involvement by MFC, molecular data were consistent 
with circulating disease (MYD88mut by AS-qPCR 3/50, IGH rearranged 6/50, both 
12/50). Therefore, PB involvement by standard techniques was detected in 71/100 
patients. MYD88mut was detected in PB by dPCR in 9/29 triple negative cases. 
Overall, 80% of the patients presented PB involvement by any technique. Our 
findings support the role of PB MFC in the evaluation of patients with IgM 
monoclonal gammopathy and provide reliable information on correlation with 
molecular features. The development of a feasible MFC assay may stand as an 
objective tool in the classification of mature B cell neoplasms presenting with 
IgM monoclonal gammopathy.
