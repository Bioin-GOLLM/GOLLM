Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a rare auditory-pigmentary disorder that exhibits 
varying combinations of sensorineural hearing loss and pigmentation defects. 
Four subtypes are clinically defined based on the presence or absence of 
additional symptoms. WS type 2 (WS2) can result from mutations within the MITF 
or SOX10 genes; however, 70% of WS2 cases remain unexplained at the molecular 
level, suggesting that other genes might be involved and/or that mutations 
within the known genes escaped previous screenings. The recent identification of 
a deletion encompassing three of the SOX10 regulatory elements in a patient 
presenting with another WS subtype, WS4, defined by its association with 
Hirschsprung disease, led us to search for deletions and point mutations within 
the MITF and SOX10 regulatory elements in 28 yet unexplained WS2 cases. Two 
nucleotide variations were identified: one in close proximity to the MITF distal 
enhancer (MDE) and one within the U1 SOX10 enhancer. Functional analyses argued 
against a pathogenic effect of these variations, suggesting that mutations 
within regulatory elements of WS genes are not a major cause of this 
neurocristopathy.
