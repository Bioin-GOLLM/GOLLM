Proteomics allows characterization of protein structure and function, 
protein-protein interactions, and peptide modifications. It has given us insight 
into the perturbations of signaling pathways within tumor cells and has improved 
the discovery of new therapeutic targets and possible indicators of response to 
and duration of therapy. The discovery, verification, and validation of novel 
biomarkers are critical in streamlining clinical development of targeted 
compounds, and directing rational treatments for patients whose tumors are 
dependent upon select signaling pathways. Studies are now underway in many 
diseases to examine the immune or inflammatory proteome, vascular proteome, 
cancer or disease proteome, and other subsets of the specific pathology 
microenvironment. Successful assay verification and biological validation of 
such biomarkers will speed development of potential agents to targetable 
dominant pathways and lead to selection of individuals most likely to benefit. 
Reconsideration of analytical and clinical trials methods for acquisition, 
examination, and translation of proteomics data must occur before we march 
further into future of drug development.
