BACKGROUND: AXIN2 and CDH1 genes play important roles during craniofacial 
morphogenesis. Mutations in these genes have been described in families 
presenting colorectal cancer and tooth agenesis, and gastric cancer and cleft 
lip/palate (CL/P). Oral clefts have been associated with tooth agenesis. We 
investigated if AXIN2 and CDH1 polymorphisms were associated with clefts or with 
any associated dental subphenotypes.
METHODS: Markers in AXIN2 and CDH1 were genotyped using Taqman chemistry in a 
sample cohort comprised of 500 cleft individuals and 500 unrelated controls.
RESULTS: Comparison between cleft and control groups showed a trend for 
association for AXIN2 with incomplete cleft palate (p = .006) and CDH1 with 
unilateral CL/P (p = .03 for left CL/P and p = .04 for right CL/P). Comparison 
of cleft subphenotypes with tooth agenesis and controls revealed borderline 
associations for CDH1 (p = .008) and AXIN2 (p = .01) with unilateral right CL/P 
with tooth agenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed only borderline results for the association of AXIN2 
and CDH1 with CL/P with and without tooth agenesis. Nevertheless, implication of 
these genes in the simultaneous occurrence of CL/P and cancer, and in tooth 
agenesis and cancer, is rather intriguing and warrants further investigations 
with other geographic and ethnic populations.
