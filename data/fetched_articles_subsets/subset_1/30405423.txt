Semaphorins are a large family of secreted, transmembrane, or GPI-anchored 
proteins initially identified as axon guidance cues signaling through their 
receptors, neuropilins, and plexins. Emerging evidence suggests that beyond the 
guidance, they also function in a broad spectrum of pathophysiological 
conditions, including atherosclerosis, a vascular inflammatory disease. 
Particular semaphorin members have been demonstrated to participate in 
atherosclerosis via eliciting endothelial dysfunction, leukocyte infiltration, 
monocyte-macrophage retention, platelet hyperreactivity, and neovascularization. 
In this review, we focus on the role of those semaphorin family members in the 
development of atherosclerosis and highlight the mechanistic relevance of 
semaphorins to atherogenesis.
