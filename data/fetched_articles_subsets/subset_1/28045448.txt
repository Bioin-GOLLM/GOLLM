Ginkgolides and bilobalide, collectively termed terpene trilactones (TTLs), are 
terpenoids that form the main active substance of Ginkgo biloba. Terpenoids in 
the mevalonate (MVA) biosynthetic pathway include acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase 
(AACT) and mevalonate kinase (MVK) as core enzymes. In this study, two 
full-length (cDNAs) encoding AACT (GbAACT, GenBank Accession No. KX904942) and 
MVK (GbMVK, GenBank Accession No. KX904944) were cloned from G. biloba. The 
deduced GbAACT and GbMVK proteins contain 404 and 396 amino acids with the 
corresponding open-reading frame (ORF) sizes of 1215 bp and 1194 bp, 
respectively. Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that GbAACT was highly 
expressed in ginkgo fruits and leaves, and GbMVK was highly expressed in leaves 
and roots. The functional complementation of GbAACT in AACT-deficient 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Δerg10 and GbMVK in MVK-deficient strain Δerg12 
confirmed that GbAACT mediated the conversion of mevalonate acetyl-CoA to 
acetoacetyl-CoA and GbMVK mediated the conversion of mevalonate to mevalonate 
phosphate. This observation indicated that GbAACT and GbMVK are functional genes 
in the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) biosynthesis pathway. After G. biloba 
seedlings were treated with methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid, the expression 
levels of GbAACT and GbMVK increased, and TTL production was enhanced. The 
cloning, characterization, expression and functional analysis of GbAACT and 
GbMVK will be helpful to understand more about the role of these two genes 
involved in TTL biosynthesis.
