The heart is a primary source of epinephrine and norepinephrine during embryonic 
development, yet little is known about the cardiac cells that produce these 
catecholamine hormones. To identify when and where catecholamine-synthesizing 
cells are found in the embryonic heart, we developed a novel mouse genetic model 
by "knocking-in" the Cre-recombinase gene to the locus encoding for the 
epinephrine biosynthetic enzyme, phenylethanolamine n-methyltransferase. When 
crossed with ROSA26 reporter mice, the beta-galactosidase gene is activated in 
adrenergic cells. A major advantage of this approach is that it allows detection 
of adrenergic cells and their progeny, regardless of whether the progeny cells 
retain an adrenergic phenotype or not. Our data show that adrenergic cells 
appear as early as embryonic day 8.5 and continue to accumulate in substantial 
numbers through birth in the mouse heart, where they appear to share common 
ancestry with myocardial lineages. Large numbers of atrial and especially 
ventricular myocytes appear to be derived from embryonic adrenergic cells in the 
heart. In addition, many of the pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial and 
atrioventricular nodes also appear to be derived from an adrenergic lineage. 
Thus, our results suggest that catecholamine-synthesizing cells serve as 
cardiomyocyte progenitors in the embryonic heart.
