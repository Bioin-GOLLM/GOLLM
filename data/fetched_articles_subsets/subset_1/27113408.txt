Despite over 50years of inhaled beta-agonists and corticosteroids as the default 
management or rescue drugs for asthma, recent research suggests that new 
therapeutic options are likely to emerge. This belief stems from both an 
improved understanding of what causes and regulates airway smooth muscle (ASM) 
contraction, and the identification of new targets whose inhibition or 
activation can relax ASM. In this review we discuss the recent findings that 
provide new insight into ASM contractile regulation, a revolution in 
pharmacology that identifies new ways to "tune" G protein-coupled receptors to 
improve therapeutic efficacy, and the discovery of several novel 
targets/approaches capable of effecting bronchoprotection or bronchodilation.
