Mitochondrial disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases with 
multisystem involvement including myocardium. Most cases of mitochondrial 
cardiomyopathy are associated with myopathy and encephalopathy and are generally 
present in infancy or childhood. The disease often exhibits a rapid downward 
course with death frequently occuring within the first year of life. We describe 
a unique case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to mitochondrial DNA mutation 
m.3303C >T in the MT-TL1 gene, diagnosed accidentally in a 35-year-old male. The 
patient initially presented with stroke of assumed cardioembolic origin due to 
the presence of two interatrial communications associated with mobile aneurysm 
of the interatrial septum. No other extracardiac manifestations of mitochondrial 
disorder were observed.
