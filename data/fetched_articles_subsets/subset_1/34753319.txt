Fibrosis is an abnormal healing process that only repairs the structure of an 
organ after injury and does not address damaged functions. The pathogenesis of 
fibrosis is multifactorial and highly complex; numerous signalling pathways are 
involved in this process, with the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 
signalling pathway playing a central role. TGF-β regulates the generation of 
myofibroblasts and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by regulating 
transcription and translation of downstream genes and precisely regulating 
fibrogenesis. The TGF-β signalling pathway can be modulated by various 
post-translational modifications, of which SUMOylation has been shown to play a 
key role. In this review, we focus on the function of SUMOylation in canonical 
and non-canonical TGF-β signalling and its role in fibrosis, providing promising 
therapeutic strategies for fibrosis.
