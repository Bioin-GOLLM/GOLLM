Wilson disease (WD) is a hereditary disorder, with recessive transmission and 
genetic heterogeneity. Several mutations of ATP7B, the gene underlying WD, were 
reported in many ethnic groups. In this study, mutation screening in ATP7B of 56 
Saudi Arabian WD patients was undertaken. The clinical data of all patients were 
recorded. The entire ATP7B coding sequence, including intron-exon boundaries 
were screened for mutation by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutation 
detection technique and DNA sequencing. Thirty-nine patients were symptomatic at 
presentation and 17 subjects were pre-symptomatic siblings of affected patients. 
Fourteen patients had neurological, 11 patients had mixed (hepatic and 
neurological), and 14 patients had hepatic presentations. Family history 
suggestive of WD was present in 72% of cases and 68% had consanguineous parents. 
Genetic analysis showed disease-causing mutations in three exons (exons 8, 19 
and 21) of the ATP7B gene in 28 patients (50%). Mutations in exons 21 (18 cases) 
and 19 (one case) were unique for Saudis. This large series of Saudi patients 
with WD has shown wide variability in the genomic substrate of WD. There is no 
correlation between genotype and clinical presentation.
