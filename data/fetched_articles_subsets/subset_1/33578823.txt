Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a well-known angiogenic factor that 
plays a critical role in various physiological and pathological processes. VEGF 
also contributes to the process of embryo implantation by enhancing embryo 
development, improving endometrial receptivity, and facilitating the 
interactions between the developing embryo and the endometrium. There is a 
correlation between the alteration of VEGF expression and reproductive failure, 
including recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and recurrent miscarriage (RM). 
In order to clarify the role of VEGF in embryo implantation, we reviewed recent 
literature concerning the expression and function of VEGF in the reproductive 
system around the time of embryo implantation and we provide a summary of the 
findings reported so far. We also explored the effects and the possible 
underlying mechanisms of action of VEGF in embryo implantation.
