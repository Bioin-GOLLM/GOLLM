OBJECTIVE: B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling is required to maintain the 
physiological functions of normal B cells and plays an important pathogenic role 
in B-cell malignancies. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), a critical mediator of BCR 
signaling, is an attractive target for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. 
This study aimed to identify a highly potent and selective BTK inhibitor.
METHODS: Homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assays were used to screen BTK 
inhibitors. Typhoon fluorescence imaging and Western blot analysis were used to 
confirm the effects of SY-1530 on the BCR signaling pathway. Additionally, the 
anti-tumor activities of SY-1530 were evaluated in TMD8 xenografts and 
spontaneous canine B-cell lymphoma.
RESULTS: We found a novel irreversible and non-competitive inhibitor of BTK, 
SY-1530, which provided dose-dependent and time-dependent inhibition. SY-1530 
selectively bound to BTK rather than inducible T-cell kinase; consequently, it 
did not significantly affect T-cell receptor signaling and caused limited 
off-target effects. SY-1530 blocked the BCR signaling pathway through 
down-regulation of BTK activity, thus leading to impaired phosphorylation of BTK 
and its downstream kinases. Moreover, SY-1530 induced apoptosis in a 
caspase-dependent manner and efficaciously inhibited tumor growth in mouse 
xenograft models of B-cell malignancy (P < 0.001). SY-1530 also induced positive 
clinical responses in spontaneous canine B-cell lymphoma.
CONCLUSIONS: SY-1530 is an irreversible and selective BTK inhibitor that shows 
inhibitory effects on B-cell malignancies by blocking the BCR signaling pathway. 
Therefore, it may be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of 
B-cell malignancies.
