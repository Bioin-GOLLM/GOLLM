Centrioles and basal bodies are structurally related organelles composed of nine 
microtubule (MT) triplets. Studies performed in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos 
have shown that centriole duplication takes place in sequential way, in which 
different proteins are recruited in a specific order to assemble a procentriole. 
ZYG-1 initiates centriole duplication by triggering the recruitment of a complex 
of SAS-5 and SAS-6, which then recruits the final player, SAS-4, to allow the 
incorporation of MT singlets. It is thought that a similar mechanism (that also 
involves additional proteins) is present in other animal cells, but it remains 
to be investigated whether the same players and their ascribed functions are 
conserved during basal body duplication in cells that exclusively contain basal 
bodies. To investigate this question, we have used the multiciliated protist 
Paramecium tetraurelia. Here we show that in the absence of PtSas4, two types of 
defects in basal body duplication can be identified. In the majority of cases, 
the germinative disk and cartwheel, the first structures assembled during 
duplication, are not detected. In addition, if daughter basal bodies were 
formed, they invariably had defects in MT recruitment. Our results suggest that 
PtSas4 has a broader function than its animal orthologues.
