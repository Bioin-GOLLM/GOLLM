PURPOSE: Substantial progress has been made in identifying susceptibility 
variants for AMD in European populations; however, few studies have been 
conducted to understand the role these variants play in AMD risk in diverse 
populations. The present study aims to examine AMD risk across diverse 
populations in known and suspected AMD complement factor and lipid-related loci.
METHODS: Targeted genotyping was performed across study sites for AMD and lipid 
trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). Genetic association 
tests were performed at individual sites and then meta-analyzed using logistic 
regression assuming an additive genetic model stratified by self-described 
race/ethnicity. Participants included cases with early or late AMD and controls 
with no signs of AMD as determined by fundus photography. Populations included 
in this study were European Americans, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and 
Singaporeans from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology 
(PAGE) study.
RESULTS: Index variants of AMD, rs1061170 (CFH) and rs10490924 (ARMS2), were 
associated with AMD at P=3.05×10(-8) and P=6.36×10(-6), respectively, in 
European Americans. In general, none of the major AMD index variants generalized 
to our non-European populations with the exception of rs10490924 in Mexican 
Americans at an uncorrected P value<0.05. Four lipid-associated SNPS (LPL rs328, 
TRIB1 rs6987702, CETP rs1800775, and KCTD10/MVK rs2338104) were associated with 
AMD in African Americans and Mexican Americans (P<0.05), but these associations 
did not survive strict corrections for multiple testing.
CONCLUSIONS: While most associations did not generalize in the non-European 
populations, variants within lipid-related genes were found to be associated 
with AMD. This study highlights the need for larger well-powered studies in 
non-European populations.
