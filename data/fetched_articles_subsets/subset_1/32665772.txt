Systemic vasculitides represent uncommon conditions characterized by the 
inflammation of blood vessels that can lead to different complex disorders 
limited to one organ or potentially involving multiple organs and systems. 
Systemic vasculitides are classified according to the diameter of the vessel 
that they mainly affect (small, medium, large, or variable). The pathogenetic 
mechanisms of systemic vasculitides are still partly unknown, as well as their 
genetic basis. For most of the primary systemic vasculitides, a single gold 
standard test is not available, and diagnosis is often made after having ruled 
out other mimicking conditions. Current research has focused on new management 
protocol and therapeutic strategies aimed at improving long-term patient 
outcomes and avoiding progression to multiorgan failure with irreversible 
damage. In this narrative review, authors describe different forms of systemic 
vasculitides through a review of the literature, with the aim of highlighting 
the current knowledge and recent findings on etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and 
therapy.
