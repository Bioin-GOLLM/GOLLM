Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are a pathological hallmark of 
more than 20 distinct neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, 
progressive supranuclear palsy, and frontotemporal dementia. While the exact 
mechanism of tau aggregation is unknown, the accumulation of aggregates 
correlates with disease progression. Here we report a genome-wide CRISPR screen 
to identify modulators of endogenous tau protein for the first time. Primary 
screens performed in SH-SY5Y cells, identified positive and negative regulators 
of tau protein levels. Hit validation of the top 43 candidate genes was 
performed using Ngn2-induced human cortical excitatory neurons. Using this 
approach, genes and pathways involved in modulation of endogenous tau levels 
were identified, including chromatin modifying enzymes, neddylation and 
ubiquitin pathway members, and components of the mTOR pathway. TSC1, a critical 
component of the mTOR pathway, was further validated in vivo, demonstrating the 
relevance of this screening strategy. These findings may have implications for 
treating neurodegenerative diseases in the future.
