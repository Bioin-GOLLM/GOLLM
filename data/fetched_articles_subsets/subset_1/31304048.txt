O-GalNAc glycans or mucin-type glycans are common protein post-translational 
modifications in eukaryotes. Core 2 O-GalNAc glycans are branched structures 
that are broadly distributed in glycoproteins and mucins of all types of cells. 
To better understand their biological roles, it is important to obtain 
structurally defined Core 2 O-GalNAc glycans. We present here regioselective 
one-pot multienzyme (OPME) chemoenzymatic strategies to systematically access a 
diverse array of sialyl Core 2 glycans. Regioselectivity can be achieved by 
using OPME systems containing a glycosyltransferase with restricted acceptor 
specificity or by differentiating the branches using altered glycosylation 
sequences. This work provides a general regioselective strategy to access 
diverse Core 2 O-GalNAc glycans which can be extended for the synthesis of other 
complex branched glycans.
