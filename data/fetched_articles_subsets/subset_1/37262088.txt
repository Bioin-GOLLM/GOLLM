Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most devastating complications of 
diabetes mellitus, where currently there is no cure available. Several important 
mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of this complication, with oxidative 
stress being one of the key factors. The past decades have seen a large number 
of publications with various aspects of this topic; however, the specific 
details of redox regulation in DKD are still unclear. This is partly because 
redox biology is very complex, coupled with a complex and heterogeneous organ 
with numerous cell types. Furthermore, often times terms such as "oxidative 
stress" or reactive oxygen species are used as a general term to cover a wide 
and rich variety of reactive species and their differing reactions. However, no 
reactive species are the same, and not all of them are capable of biologically 
relevant reactions or "redox signaling." The goal of this review is to provide a 
biochemical background for an array of specific reactive oxygen species types 
with varying reactivity and specificity in the kidney as well as highlight some 
of the advances in redox biology that are paving the way to a better 
understanding of DKD development and risk.
