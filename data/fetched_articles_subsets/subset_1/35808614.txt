Nuclear power facilities are being expanded to satisfy expanding worldwide 
energy demand. Thus, uranium recovery from secondary resources has become a hot 
topic in terms of environmental protection and nuclear fuel conservation. 
Herein, a mesoporous biosorbent of a hybrid magnetic-chitosan nanocomposite 
functionalized with cysteine (Cys) was synthesized via subsequent heterogeneous 
nucleation for selectively enhanced uranyl ion (UO22+) sorption. Various 
analytical tools were used to confirm the mesoporous nanocomposite structural 
characteristics and confirm the synthetic route. The characteristics of the 
synthesized nanocomposite were as follows: superparamagnetic with saturation 
magnetization (MS: 25.81 emu/g), a specific surface area (SBET: 42.56 m2/g) with 
a unipore mesoporous structure, an amine content of ~2.43 mmol N/g, and a 
density of ~17.19/nm2. The experimental results showed that the sorption was 
highly efficient: for the isotherm fitted by the Langmuir equation, the maximum 
capacity was about 0.575 mmol U/g at pH range 3.5-5.0, and Temperature (25 ± 1 
°C); further, there was excellent selectivity for UO22+, likely due to the 
chemical valent difference. The sorption process was fast (~50 min), simulated 
with the pseudo-second-order equation, and the sorption half-time (t1/2) was 
3.86 min. The sophisticated spectroscopic studies (FTIR and XPS) revealed that 
the sorption mechanism was linked to complexation and ion exchange by 
interaction with S/N/O multiple functional groups. The sorption was exothermic, 
spontaneous, and governed by entropy change. Desorption and regeneration were 
carried out using an acidified urea solution (0.25 M) that was recycled for a 
minimum of six cycles, resulting in a sorption and desorption efficiency of over 
91%. The as-synthesized nanocomposite's high stability, durability, and chemical 
resistivity were confirmed over multiple cycles using FTIR and leachability. 
Finally, the sorbent was efficiently tested for selective uranium sorption from 
multicomponent acidic simulated nuclear solution. Owing to such excellent 
performance, the Cys nanocomposite is greatly promising in the uranium recovery 
field.
