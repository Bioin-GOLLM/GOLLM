INTRODUCTION: A genetic variant explaining a part of the exposure of many kinase 
inhibitors (KIs) is the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) CYP3A4*22, 
resulting in less CYP3A4 enzyme activity. The primary aim of this study was to 
investigate if the systemic exposure is non-inferior after a dose reduction of 
KIs metabolized by CYP3A4 in CYP3A4*22 carriers compared to patients without 
this SNP (i.e., wildtype patients) receiving the standard dose.
METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective, non-inferiority study, patients were 
screened for the presence of CYP3A4*22. Patients with the CYP3A4*22 SNP received 
a 20-33% dose reduction. At steady state, a pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was 
performed and compared to the PK results from wildtype patients treated with the 
registered dose using a two-stage individual patient data meta-analysis 
approach.
RESULTS: In total, 207 patients were included in the final analysis. The 
CYP3A4*22 SNP was found in 16% of the patients in the final analysis (n = 34). 
Most of the included patients received imatinib (37%) or pazopanib (22%) 
treatment. The overall geometric mean ratio (GMR) comparing the exposure of the 
CYP3A4*22 carriers to the exposure of the wildtype CYP3A4 patients was 0.89 (90% 
confidence interval: 0.77-1.03).
CONCLUSION: Non-inferiority could not be proven for dose reduction of KIs 
metabolized by CYP3A4 in CYP3A4*22 carriers compared to the registered dose in 
wildtype patients. Therefore, an up-front dose reduction based upon the 
CYP3A4*22 SNP for all KIs does not seem an eligible new way of personalized 
therapy.
