There is a pressing clinical need to develop cell-based bone therapies due to a 
lack of viable, autologous bone grafts and a growing demand for bone grafts in 
musculoskeletal surgery. Such therapies can be tissue engineered and cellular, 
such as osteoblasts, combined with a material scaffold. Because mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSCs) are both available and fast growing compared to mature osteoblasts, 
therapies that utilize these progenitor cells are particularly promising. We 
have developed a nanovibrational bioreactor that can convert MSCs into 
bone-forming osteoblasts in two- and three-dimensional, but the mechanisms 
involved in this osteoinduction process remain unclear. Here, to elucidate this 
mechanism, we use increasing vibrational amplitude, from 30 nm (N30) to 90 nm 
(N90) amplitudes at 1000 Hz and assess MSC metabolite, gene, and protein 
changes. These approaches reveal that dose-dependent changes occur in MSCs' 
responses to increased vibrational amplitude, particularly in adhesion and 
mechanosensitive ion channel expression and that energetic metabolic pathways 
are activated, leading to low-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and 
to low-level inflammation as well as to ROS- and inflammation-balancing 
pathways. These events are analogous to those that occur in the natural 
bone-healing processes. We have also developed a tissue engineered MSC-laden 
scaffold designed using cells' mechanical memory, driven by the stronger N90 
stimulation. These mechanistic insights and cell-scaffold design are underpinned 
by a process that is free of inductive chemicals.
