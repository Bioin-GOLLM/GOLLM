Trans-activation element DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) characterizes 
insoluble protein aggregates in distinct subtypes of frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TDP-43 mediates many RNA 
processing steps within distinct protein complexes. Here we identify novel 
TDP-43 protein interactors found in a yeast two-hybrid screen using an adult 
human brain cDNA library. We confirmed the TDP-43 interaction of seven hits by 
co-immunoprecipitation and assessed their co-localization in HEK293E cells. As 
pathological TDP-43 is ubiquitinated, we focused on the ubiquitin-conjugating 
enzyme UBE2E3 and the ubiquitin isopeptidase Y (UBPY). When cells were treated 
with proteasome inhibitor, ubiquitinated and insoluble TDP-43 species 
accumulated. All three UBE2E family members could enhance the ubiquitination of 
TDP-43, whereas catalytically inactive UBE2E3(C145S) was much less efficient. 
Conversely, silencing of UBE2E3 reduced TDP-43 ubiquitination. We examined 15 of 
the 48 known disease-associated TDP-43 mutants and found that one was 
excessively ubiquitinated. This strong TDP-43(K263E) ubiquitination was further 
enhanced by proteasomal inhibition as well as UBE2E3 expression. Conversely, 
UBE2E3 silencing and expression of UBPY reduced TDP-43(K263E) ubiquitination. 
Moreover, wild-type but not active site mutant UBPY reduced ubiquitination of 
TDP-43 C-terminal fragments and of a nuclear import-impaired mutant. In 
Drosophila melanogaster, UBPY silencing enhanced neurodegenerative TDP-43 
phenotypes and the accumulation of insoluble high molecular weight TDP-43 and 
ubiquitin species. Thus, UBE2E3 and UBPY participate in the regulation of TDP-43 
ubiquitination, solubility, and neurodegeneration.
