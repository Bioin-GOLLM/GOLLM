Intuitive cancer risk perceptions may inform strategies to motivate cancer 
prevention behaviors. This study evaluated factor structure and measurement 
invariance of two new measures of intuitive cancer risk, the Cognitive Causation 
and Negative Affect in Risk scales. Single- and multiple-group confirmatory 
factor analysis models were fit to responses from three diverse samples. The 
confirmatory factor analysis models fit the data well, with all comparative fit 
indices (CFI) ≥ 0.94. Items flagged by chi-square difference tests as 
potentially non-invariant were largely invariant between samples according to 
practical fit indices (e.g. ΔCFI). These novel scales may be particularly 
relevant in diverse, underserved populations.
