BACKGROUND: The carrier status of lavender foal syndrome (LFS), cerebellar 
abiotrophy (CA), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and 
occipitoatlantoaxial malformation (OAAM1) in foals with juvenile idiopathic 
epilepsy (JIE) is unknown.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine the carrier status of LFS, CA, SCID, and 
OAAM1 in foals with JIE.
ANIMALS: Ten foals with JIE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Archived DNA samples were tested for known genetic 
mutations causing LFS, CA, SCID, and OAAM1. The inclusion criteria consisted of 
having been diagnosed with JIE by ruling out other causes of seizures in foals 
and supported by electroencephalographic examination.
RESULTS: Ten Egyptian Arabian horses (5 females and 5 males) were phenotyped as 
foals with JIE by electroencephalography (EEG). All foals were negative for the 
genetic mutations that cause LFS, CA, SCID, and OAAM1 except for 1 foal that was 
a carrier of CA.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Juvenile idiopathic epilepsy of Egyptian 
Arabian foals and LFS appear to be phenotypically and genetically distinct 
disorders. There was no apparent association between JIE and LFS, CA, SCID, and 
OAAM1.
