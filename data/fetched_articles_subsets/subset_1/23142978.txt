Preribosomal particles evolve in the nucleus through transient interaction with 
biogenesis factors before export to the cytoplasm. Here, we report the 
architecture of the late pre-60S particle, purified from Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, through Arx1, a nuclear export factor with structural homology to 
methionine aminopeptidases, or its binding partner Alb1. Cryo-EM reconstruction 
of the Arx1 particle at 11.9-Å resolution reveals regions of extra density on 
the pre-60S particle attributed to associated biogenesis factors, confirming the 
immature state of the nascent subunit. One of these densities could be 
unambiguously assigned to Arx1. Immunoelectron microscopy and UV cross-linking 
localize Arx1 close to the ribosomal exit tunnel, in direct contact with ES27, a 
highly dynamic eukaryotic rRNA expansion segment. The binding of Arx1 at the 
exit tunnel may position this export factor to prevent premature recruitment of 
ribosome-associated factors active during translation.
