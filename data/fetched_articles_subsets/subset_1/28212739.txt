BACKGROUND: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by reduced penetrance and 
variable QT prolongation over time, resulting in an estimate of 25% carriers of 
a pathogenic mutation with a normal corrected QT (QTc) interval on the resting 
electrocardiogram (ECG).
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that an 
individualized corrected QT interval derived from 24-hour Holter data more 
accurately predicts carriage of a pathogenic LQTS mutation than did QT derived 
from a standard 12-lead ECG and corrected using the Bazett formula (QTc 
interval).
METHODS: Carriers of a pathogenic LQTS mutation and their genotype-negative 
family members who had both resting ECG and Holter recordings available were 
included. Automated and manual measurements of QTc were performed. QTi was 
derived from 24-hour Holter recordings and defined as the QT value at the 
intersection of an RR interval of 1000 ms, with the linear regression line 
fitted through QT-RR data points of each individual patient.
RESULTS: In total, 69 patients with LQTS (23 long QT type 1, 39 long QT type 2, 
and 7 long QT type 3) and 55 controls were selected. Demographic characteristics 
were comparable. A comparison of the receiver operating characteristic curves 
indicates that the test added diagnostic value compared to manual measurement (P 
= .02) or automated measurement (P = .005). The diagnostic accuracy of manually 
measured QTc using conventional cutoff criteria was 72%, while it was 92% using 
a sex-independent QTi cutoff of 445 ms. This was caused by a 39% increase in 
sensitivity without compromising the specificity.
CONCLUSION: QTi derived from Holter recordings is superior to conventional QTc 
measured from a standard 12-lead ECG in predicting the mutation carrier state in 
families with LQTS.
