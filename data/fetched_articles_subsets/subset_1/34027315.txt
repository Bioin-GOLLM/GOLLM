While several genes and clinical traits have been associated with higher risk of 
severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), how host genetic variants may 
interact with these parameters and contribute to severe disease is still 
unclear. Herein, we performed phenome-wide association study, tissue and 
immune-cell-specific expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)/splicing 
quantitative trait locus, and colocalization analyses for genetic risk loci 
suggestively associated with severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure. Thirteen 
phenotypes/traits were associated with the severe COVID-19-associated loci at 
the genome-wide significance threshold, including monocyte counts, fat 
metabolism traits, and fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. In addition, 
we identified tissue and immune subtype-specific eQTL associations affecting 48 
genes, including several ones that may directly impact host immune responses, 
colocalized with the severe COVID-19 genome-wide association study associations, 
and showed altered expression in single-cell transcriptomes. Collectively, our 
work demonstrates that host genetic variations associated with multiple genes 
and traits show genetic pleiotropy with severe COVID-19 and may inform disease 
etiology.
