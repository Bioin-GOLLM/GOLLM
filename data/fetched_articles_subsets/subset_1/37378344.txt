The tobacco hornworm is used extensively as a model system for ecotoxicology, 
immunology and gut physiology. Here, we established a micro-computed tomography 
approach based on the oral application of the clinical contrast agent iodixanol, 
allowing for a high-resolution quantitative analysis of the Manduca sexta gut. 
This technique permitted the identification of previously unknown and 
understudied structures, such as the crop or gastric ceca, and revealed the 
underlying complexity of the hindgut folding pattern, which is involved in fecal 
pellet formation. The acquired data enabled the volume rendering of all gut 
parts, the reliable calculation of their volumes, and the virtual endoscopy of 
the entire alimentary tract. It can provide information for accurate orientation 
in histology uses, enable quantitative anatomical phenotyping in three 
dimensions, and allow the calculation of locally effective midgut concentrations 
of applied chemicals. This atlas will provide critical insights into the 
evolution of the alimentary tract in lepidopterans.
