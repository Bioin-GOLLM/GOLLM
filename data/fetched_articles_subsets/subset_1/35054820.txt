Tyrosine (Tyr) is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, 
catecholamines, thyroid hormones, etc. Multiple pathologies are associated with 
impaired Tyr metabolism. Silver nanoclusters (Ag NCs) can be applied for 
colorimetric, fluorescent, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) 
detection of Tyr. However, one should understand the theoretical basics of 
interactions between Tyr and Ag NCs. Thereby, we calculated the binding energy 
(Eb) between Tyr and Agnq (n = 1-8; q = 0-2) NCs using the density functional 
theory (DFT) to find the most stable complexes. Since Ag NCs are synthesized on 
Tyr in an aqueous solution at pH 12.5, we studied Tyr-1, semiquinone (SemiQ-1), 
and Tyr-2. Ag32+ and Ag5+ had the highest Eb. The absorption spectrum of Tyr-2 
significantly red-shifts with the attachment of Ag32+, which is prospective for 
colorimetric Tyr detection. Ag32+ interacts with all functional groups of 
SemiQ-1 (phenolate, amino group, and carboxylate), which makes detection of Tyr 
possible due to band emergence at 1324 cm-1 in the vibrational spectrum. The 
ground state charge transfer between Ag and carboxylate determines the band 
emergence at 1661 cm-1 in the Raman spectrum of the SemiQ-1-Ag32+ complex. Thus, 
the prospects of Tyr detection using silver nanoclusters were demonstrated.
