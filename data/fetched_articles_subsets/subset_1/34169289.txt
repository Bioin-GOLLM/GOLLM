Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy shows long-term effects in many cancer types, but 
resistance and relapse remain the main limitations of this therapy. Here, we 
describe a protocol to evaluate the tumor response to immunotherapy in a mouse 
lung cancer model. The protocol includes the establishment of the lung cancer 
mouse model, anti-PD-1 treatment, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte isolation, 
immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry analysis. This protocol can also be 
applied to other cancer types and immunotherapies. For complete details on the 
use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Yu et al. (2021).
