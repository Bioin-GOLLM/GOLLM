Nuclear receptors (NRs) function collectively as a transcriptional signaling 
network that mediates gene regulatory actions to either maintain cellular 
homeostasis in response to hormonal, dietary and other environmental factors, or 
act as orphan receptors with no known ligand. NR complexes are large and 
interact with multiple protein partners, collectively termed coregulators. 
Coregulators are essential for regulating NR activity and can dictate whether a 
target gene is activated or repressed by a variety of mechanisms including the 
regulation of chromatin accessibility. Altered expression of coregulators 
contributes to a variety of hormone-dependent cancers including breast and 
prostate cancers. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which coregulators 
interact with and modulate the activity of NRs provides opportunities to develop 
better prognostic and diagnostic approaches, as well as novel therapeutic 
targets. This review aims to gather and summarize recent studies, techniques and 
bioinformatics methods used to identify distorted NR coregulator interactions 
that contribute as cancer drivers in hormone-dependent cancers.
