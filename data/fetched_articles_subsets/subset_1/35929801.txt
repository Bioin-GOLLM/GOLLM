TANDEM ZINC-FINGER/PLUS3 (TZP) is a transcriptional regulator that acts at the 
crossroads of light and photoperiodic signaling. Here, we unveil a role for TZP 
in fine-tuning hypocotyl elongation under red light and long-day conditions. We 
provide genetic evidence for a synergistic action between TZP and PHOTOPERIODIC 
CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL 1 (PCH1) in regulating the protein abundance of PHYTOCHROME 
INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) and downstream gene expression in response to red 
light and long days (LDs). Furthermore, we show that TZP is a positive regulator 
of the red/far-red light receptor and thermosensor phytochrome B (phyB) by 
promoting phyB protein abundance, nuclear body formation, and signaling. Our 
data therefore assign a function to TZP in regulating two key red light 
signaling components, phyB and PIF4, but also uncover a new role for PCH1 in 
regulating hypocotyl elongation in LDs. Our findings provide a framework for the 
understanding of the mechanisms associated with the TZP signal integration 
network and their importance for optimizing plant growth and adaptation to a 
changing environment.
