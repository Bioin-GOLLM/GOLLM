BACKGROUND: Rosacea is a common and complex chronic inflammatory skin disorder, 
the pathophysiology and etiology of which remain unclear. Recently, significant 
new insights into rosacea pathogenesis have enriched and reshaped our 
understanding of the disorder. A systematic analysis based on current studies 
will facilitate further research on rosacea pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To establish an international core outcome and knowledge system of 
rosacea pathogenesis and develop a challenge, trend and hot spot analysis set 
for research and clinical studies on rosacea using bibliometric analysis and 
data mining.
METHODS: A search of the WoS, and PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane 
collaboration databases was conducted to perform visual bibliometric and data 
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 2,654 studies were used for the visualization and 302 of the 
6,769 outcomes for data analysis. It reveals an increased trend line in the 
field of rosacea, in which its fast-growing pathogenesis attracted attention 
closely related to risk, comorbidity and therapeutic strategies. The rosacea 
pathogenesis has undergone the great development on immunology, microorganisms, 
genes, skin barriers and neurogenetics. The major of studies have focused on 
immune and microorganisms. And keyword visualization and data analyses 
demonstrated the cross-talk between cells or each aspect of pathogenesis, such 
as gene-gene or gene-environment interactions, and neurological mechanisms 
associated with the rosacea phenotype warrant further research.
LIMITATIONS: Inherent limitations of bibliometrics; and reliance on research and 
retrospective studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The understanding of rosacea's pathogenesis has been significantly 
enhanced with the improved technology and multidisciplinary integration, but 
high-quality, strong evidence in favor of genomic and neurogenic requires 
further research combined with a better understanding of risks and comorbidities 
to guide clinical practice.
