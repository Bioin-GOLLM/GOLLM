BACKGROUND: Upper limb dysfunction seriously affects the ability of stroke 
patients to perform activities of daily living. As a popular exercise therapy, 
Tai Chi may become an alternative intervention. However, the neurophysiological 
mechanism by which Tai Chi improves upper limb dysfunction in stroke patients is 
still unclear, which limits its further promotion and application. Therefore, 
conducting a strict randomized clinical trial is necessary to observe how Tai 
Chi affects upper limb dysfunction in stroke patients and to explore its 
neurophysiological mechanism.
METHODS/DESIGN: This report describes a randomized, parallel-controlled trial 
with distributive concealment and evaluator blinding. A total of 84 eligible 
participants will be randomly assigned to the Tai Chi group or the control group 
in a 1:1 ratio. The participants in the Tai Chi group will receive 4 weeks of 
Tai Chi training: five 60-min sessions a week for a total of 20 sessions. The 
participants in the control group will not receive Tai Chi training. Both groups 
will receive medical treatment and routine rehabilitation training. The primary 
outcome measure is the mean change in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity 
(FMA-UE) scale score between baseline and 4 weeks; the secondary outcomes are 
the mean changes in kinematic characteristics and the Wolf Motor Function Test 
(WMFT) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) scores. In addition, the corticomuscular 
coupling level and near-infrared brain functional imaging will be monitored to 
explore the mechanism by which Tai Chi improves upper limb function of stroke 
patients.
DISCUSSION: This randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of 
Tai Chi in stroke patients with upper limb dysfunction and explore the 
neurophysiological mechanism. Positive results will verify that Tai Chi can 
improve upper limb function of stroke patients.
