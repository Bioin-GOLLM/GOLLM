The frequency of beta-thalassemia alleles among Filipinos is estimated to be 
0.02, although little is known about the actual mutations represented in this 
population. Here, we describe a Filipino family in which a child has severe 
beta-thalassemia major. Molecular studies of the family revealed that the 
proband is a compound heterozygote for two previously unreported beta 
zero-thalassemia alleles: a frameshift mutation (-TG) at codon 67 and a deletion 
of the entire beta-globin gene. The 5' endpoint of this novel deletion is 
located approximately 3.9 kb to approximately 4.3 kb upstream of beta-globin 
gene, and the deletion extends 3' beyond the beta-globin gene for an 
undetermined distance. The occurrence of two novel beta-thalassemia alleles in a 
single family suggests that the Filipino population may have a unique spectrum 
of beta-thalassemia alleles.
