The prototypical hydrogen-producing enzyme, the membrane-bound 
formate hydrogenlyase (FHL) complex from Escherichia coli, links formate 
oxidation at a molybdopterin-containing formate dehydrogenase to proton 
reduction at a [NiFe] hydrogenase. It is of intense interest due to its ability 
to efficiently produce H2 during fermentation, its reversibility, allowing 
H2-dependent CO2 reduction, and its evolutionary link to respiratory complex I. 
FHL has been studied for over a century, but its atomic structure remains 
unknown. Here we report cryo-EM structures of FHL in its aerobically and 
anaerobically isolated forms at resolutions reaching 2.6 Å. This includes 
well-resolved density for conserved loops linking the soluble and membrane arms 
believed to be essential in coupling enzymatic turnover to ion translocation 
across the membrane in the complex I superfamily. We evaluate possible 
structural determinants of the bias toward hydrogen production over its 
oxidation and describe an unpredicted metal-binding site near the interface of 
FdhF and HycF subunits that may play a role in redox-dependent regulation of 
FdhF interaction with the complex.
