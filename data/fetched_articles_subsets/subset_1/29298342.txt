The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway is central for innate immune 
sensing of various bacterial, viral and protozoal infections. Recent studies 
identified the common HAQ and R232H alleles of TMEM173/STING, but the functional 
consequences of these variants for primary infections are unknown. Here we 
demonstrate that cGAS- and STING-deficient murine macrophages as well as human 
cells of individuals carrying HAQ TMEM173/STING were severely impaired in 
producing type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to Legionella 
pneumophila, bacterial DNA or cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). In contrast, R232H 
attenuated cytokine production only following stimulation with bacterial CDN, 
but not in response to L. pneumophila or DNA. In a mouse model of Legionnaires' 
disease, cGAS- and STING-deficient animals exhibited higher bacterial loads as 
compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, the haplotype frequency of HAQ 
TMEM173/STING, but not of R232H TMEM173/STING, was increased in two independent 
cohorts of human Legionnaires' disease patients as compared to healthy controls. 
Our study reveals that the cGAS-STING cascade contributes to antibacterial 
defense against L. pneumophila in mice and men, and provides important insight 
into how the common HAQ TMEM173/STING variant affects antimicrobial immune 
responses and susceptibility to infection.
