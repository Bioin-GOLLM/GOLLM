The clinical approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors is an important 
advancement in the field of cancer immunotherapy. However, the percentage of 
beneficiaries is still limited and it is becoming clear that combination 
therapies are required to further enhance the treatment efficacy. The potential 
of strategies targeting the immunoregulatory network by "hitting the gas pedal" 
as opposed to "blocking the brakes" is being recognized and intensively 
investigated. Hence, next to immune checkpoint inhibitors, agonists of 
co-stimulatory receptors of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNF-SF) are 
emerging as promising options to expand the immunomodulatory toolbox. In this 
review the development of different categories of recombinant antibody and 
ligand-based agonists of 4-1BB, OX40, and GITR is summarized and discussed in 
the context of the challenges presented by the structural and mechanistical 
features of the TNFR-SF. An overview of current formats, trends, and clinical 
studies is provided.
