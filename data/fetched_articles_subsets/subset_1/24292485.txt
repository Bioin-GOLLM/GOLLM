Cells produce electrophilic products with the potential to modify and affect the 
function of proteins. Chemoproteomic methods have provided a means to 
qualitatively inventory proteins targeted by endogenous electrophiles; however, 
ascertaining the potency and specificity of these reactions to identify the 
sites in the proteome that are most sensitive to electrophilic modification 
requires more quantitative methods. Here we describe a competitive 
activity-based profiling method for quantifying the reactivity of electrophilic 
compounds against >1,000 cysteines in parallel in the human proteome. Using this 
approach, we identified a select set of proteins that constitute 'hot spots' for 
modification by various lipid-derived electrophiles, including the oxidative 
stress product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). We show that one of these proteins, 
ZAK kinase, is labeled by HNE on a conserved, active site-proximal cysteine and 
that the resulting enzyme inhibition creates a negative feedback mechanism that 
can suppress the activation of JNK pathways normally induced by oxidative 
stress.
