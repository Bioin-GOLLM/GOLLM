Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is caused by mutations within the 
fibrillin-2 gene (FBN2), which is crucial for microfibril structure. Affected 
individuals may have contractures, chest wall deformities, scoliosis, abnormal 
ear folding and elongated limbs. We describe a novel FBN2 mutation in a woman 
with CCA who also had pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection. 
The population with pulmonary NTM infections shares phenotypic features with 
CCA, such as elongated body habitus, scoliosis and pectus deformities. While it 
is unlikely that FBN2 defects account for susceptibility to NTM infection in the 
majority of cases, the overlap between these two diseases suggests some shared 
pathophysiology.
