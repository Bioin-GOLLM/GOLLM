Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) catalyzes synthesis of asparagine (Asn) and Glu 
from Asp and Gln in an ATP-dependent reaction. Asparagine synthetase deficiency 
(ASNSD) results from biallelic mutations in the ASNS gene. Affected children 
exhibit congenital microcephaly, continued brain atrophy, seizures, and often 
premature mortality. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This report 
describes a compound heterozygotic ASNSD child with two novel mutations in the 
ASNS gene, c.1118G>T (paternal) and c.1556G>A (maternal), that lead to G373V or 
R519H ASNS variants. Structural mapping suggested that neither variant 
participates directly in catalysis. Growth of cultured fibroblasts from either 
parent was unaffected in Asn-free medium, whereas growth of the child's cells 
was suppressed by about 50%. Analysis of Asn levels unexpectedly revealed that 
extracellular rather than intracellular Asn correlated with the reduced 
proliferation during incubation of the child's cells in Asn-free medium. Our 
attempts to ectopically express the G373V variant in either HEK293T or JRS cells 
resulted in minimal protein production, suggesting instability. Protein 
expression and purification from HEK293T cells revealed reduced activity for the 
R519H variant relative to WT ASNS. Expression of WT ASNS in ASNS-null JRS cells 
resulted in nearly complete rescue of growth in Asn-free medium, whereas we 
observed no proliferation for the cells expressing either the G373V or R519H 
variant. These results support the conclusion that the coexpression of the G373V 
and R519H ASNS variants leads to significantly reduced Asn synthesis, which 
negatively impacts cellular growth. These observations are consistent with the 
ASNSD phenotype.
