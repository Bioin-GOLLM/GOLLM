The human gut symbiont Ruminococcus gnavus displays strain-specific repertoires 
of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) contributing to its spatial location in the gut. 
Sequence similarity network analysis identified strain-specific differences in 
blood-group endo-β-1,4-galactosidase belonging to the GH98 family. We determined 
the substrate and linkage specificities of GH98 from R. gnavus ATCC 29149, 
RgGH98, against a range of defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates 
including mucin. We showed by HPAEC-PAD and LC-FD-MS/MS that RgGH98 is specific 
for blood group A tetrasaccharide type II (BgA II). Isothermal titration 
calorimetry (ITC) and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR confirmed RgGH98 
affinity for blood group A over blood group B and H antigens. The molecular 
basis of RgGH98 strict specificity was further investigated using a combination 
of glycan microarrays, site-directed mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography. The 
crystal structures of RgGH98 in complex with BgA trisaccharide (BgAtri) and of 
RgGH98 E411A with BgA II revealed a dedicated hydrogen network of residues, 
which were shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical to the recognition 
of the BgA epitope. We demonstrated experimentally that RgGH98 is part of an 
operon of 10 genes that is overexpresssed in vitro when R. gnavus ATCC 29149 is 
grown on mucin as sole carbon source as shown by RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR 
confirmed RgGH98 expression on BgA II growth. Using MALDI-ToF MS, we showed that 
RgGH98 releases BgAtri from mucin and that pretreatment of mucin with RgGH98 
confered R. gnavus E1 the ability to grow, by enabling the E1 strain to 
metabolise BgAtri and access the underlying mucin glycan chain. These data 
further support that the GH repertoire of R. gnavus strains enable them to 
colonise different nutritional niches in the human gut and has potential 
applications in diagnostic and therapeutics against infection.
