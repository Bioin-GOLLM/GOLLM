BACKGROUND: A common Arg/Pro polymorphism at codon 72 of the TP53 gene has been 
investigated as a risk factor for cancer in different populations. So far, the 
results have been controversial. Our purpose was to investigate the association 
of this polymorphism with breast carcinoma in women from Southern Brazil, a 
high-risk area for breast cancer.
METHODS: Blood samples collected from 118 women with primary breast carcinoma 
and from 202 female blood donors were analyzed through polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: The relative frequency of each allele was 0.75 for Arg and 0.25 for Pro 
in patients with cancer, and 0.62 for Arg and 0.38 for Pro in normal controls (P 
< 0.001). The Arg/Arg genotype was significantly associated with an increased 
risk for breast cancer (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.43-3.6; P < 0.002). No correlation 
between the genotype distribution and specific prognostic predictors for the 
disease outcome was observed.
DISCUSSION: TP53 codon 72 polymorphism might be implicated in breast 
carcinogenesis, with the Arg/Arg genotype being associated with an increased 
susceptibility for this malignancy.
