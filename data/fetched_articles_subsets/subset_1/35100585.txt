INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) is correlated with nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through the biological functions of regulating 
plasma vitamin D (VD) level and the inflammatory process.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the effects of VD level and VDBP gene 
polymorphisms on the risk of NAFLD in a Chinese population.
METHODS: Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were measured and seven VDBP 
candidate genetic variants (rs222020, rs2282679, rs4588, rs1155563, rs7041, 
rs16847024, rs3733359) were genotyped among participants in this case-control 
study. The control group was frequency-matched to the NAFLD case group by age 
and gender. Correlation analysis and multiple linear regressions were used to 
screen determinants of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. Multivariable unconditional 
logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence 
interval (95% CI). The prediction capability of models containing independent 
factors was estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow test.
RESULTS: Age, body mass index, and triacylglycerol were independent factors 
influencing VD levels. Participants with low VD levels had significantly higher 
prevalence of NAFLD compared to subjects with normal VD levels (p < 0.001). A 
low VD level contributed to increased the risk of NAFLD, independent of 
metabolic factors known to affect VD levels (adjusted OR = 2.282, 95% CI = 
1.422-3.661, p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that individuals 
carrying rs7041-G allele had a significantly decreased the risk of NAFLD 
occurrence compared to T allele (additive model: adjusted OR = 0.814, 95% CI = 
0.713-0.929, p = 0.002; codominant model: adjusted OR = 0.623, 95% CI = 
0.449-0.866, p = 0.005), after adjusting for age, gender, and overweight. 
Stratification by multiple metabolic disorders did not alter this relationship. 
Moreover, we developed a simple model including age, gender, metabolic 
disorders, and VDBP single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to assess NAFLD risk, 
an AUC of which being 0.817, significantly higher than the model not included 
VDBP SNP, with Hosmer-Lemeshow test fitting well (p = 0.182).
CONCLUSIONS: Low plasma VD levels may increase susceptibility to NAFLD, while 
rs7041-G allele in VDBP contributed to a decreased NAFLD risk among Chinese 
population. The VDBP variant significantly improved the capability for NAFLD 
risk assessment, which could be used for early screening and management of 
NAFLD.
