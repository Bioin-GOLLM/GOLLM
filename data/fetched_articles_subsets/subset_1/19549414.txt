Recent work indicates that an Aurora kinase inhibitor MK-0457 (VX-680), a 
small-molecule inhibitor of Aurora kinases A, B, C and BCR-ABL, FLT-3, JAK-2, 
can block the progression of cell growth cycle, causing apoptosis in a range of 
human tumors. MK-0457 has the activity against expressions of wild-type and 
mutated bcr-abl gene, including the T315I mutant, and can inhibit the activity 
of FLT-3, JAK-2 and their mutated types as well. Clinical applications suggest 
that the MK-0457 has therapeutic effect on the highly refractory CML and CML 
with poor prognosis, Ph(+) ALL with T315I mutant, relapse refractory AML and 
JAK-2 positive myeloproliferative diseases (MPD). The intensive preclinical 
studies and the on-going phase II clinical trials will open up a new vista of 
therapy for some hematological malignancies. This review focuses on the 
pharmacologic action of MK-0457 and its clinical trial as well as combined 
application.
