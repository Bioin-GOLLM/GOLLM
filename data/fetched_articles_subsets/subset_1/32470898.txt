The neuropathological feature of multiple system atrophy (MSA), a fatal 
adult-onset disorder without effective therapy, is the accumulation of 
pathological α-synuclein (α-Syn) in the central nervous system (CNS). Here we 
show that pathological α-Syn exists in nerve terminals in detrusor and external 
urethral sphincter (EUS) of patients with MSA. Furthermore, α-Syn-preformed 
fibrils (PFFs) injected in the EUS or detrusor in TgM83+/- mice initiated the 
transmission of pathological α-Syn from the urogenital tract to brain via 
micturition reflex pathways, and these mice developed widespread phosphorylated 
α-Syn inclusion pathology together with phenotypes. In addition, urinary 
dysfunction and denervation-reinnervation of external anal sphincter were 
detected earlier in the mouse models with α-Syn PFFs inoculation before the 
behavioral manifestations. These results suggest that pathological α-Syn 
spreading through the micturition reflex pathways retrogradely from the 
urogenital tract to CNS may lead to urinary dysfunction in patients with MSA, 
which is different from the etiology of idiopathic Parkinson disease.
