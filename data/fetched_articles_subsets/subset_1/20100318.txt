INTRODUCTION: Patients with tuberculosis (TB) frequently produce 
anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). The objective of this study is to 
characterize the citrulline-dependence of the ACPA reactivity in sera of 
patients with mycobacterium infections.
METHODS: Serum samples of 134 patients with untreated mycobacterium infections 
(122 TB, 12 nontuberculous mycobacterium) were tested for antibodies against 
both the citrullinated (Cit) and the non-citrullinated (Arg) form of 2 cyclic 
synthetic peptides. In 33 patients, a follow-up sample was tested six months 
after starting anti-mycobacterial drugs.
RESULTS: A substantial proportion of patients with mycobacterial infections 
demonstrated antibodies against 0401Cit, 0401Arg, 0722Cit and 0722Arg. Fourteen 
patients demonstrated anti-0401Cit, 83 anti-0401Arg, 22 anti-0722Cit and 61 
anti-0722Arg, while none of these antibodies were detected in the 20 healthy 
controls. All the patients but one, who were anti-0401Cit and anti-0722Cit 
positive, demonstrated reactivity against the respective Arg peptide. In the 
subset of 33 patients with a follow-up test six months after starting treatment, 
the mean levels of antibodies to 0401Cit, 0401Arg, 0722Cit and 0722Arg 
significantly decreased after treatment. All the patients who were anti-0401Cit 
and anti-0722Cit positive turned negative after treatment. The presence of 
anti-0401Cit/Arg and anti-0722Cit/Arg was found to be significantly correlated 
with the presence of HIV.
CONCLUSIONS: ACPA may be found in patients with TB. In most of the cases, the 
reactivity is citrulline independent. A positive cyclic citrullinated peptide 
(CCP) test in these patients should therefore be interpreted with care, and 
preferably followed by a control ELISA with a non-citrullinated antigen.
