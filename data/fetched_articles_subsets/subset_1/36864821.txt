Acne vulgaris is a chronic disfiguring skin disease affecting ∼1 billion people 
worldwide, often having persistent negative effects on physical and mental 
health. The Gram-positive anaerobe, Cutibacterium acnes is implicated in acne 
pathogenesis and is, therefore, a main target for antibiotic-based acne therapy. 
We determined a 2.8-Å resolution structure of the 70S ribosome of Cutibacterium 
acnes by cryogenic electron microscopy and discovered that sarecycline, a 
narrow-spectrum antibiotic against Cutibacterium acnes, may inhibit two active 
sites of this bacterium's ribosome in contrast to the one site detected 
previously on the model ribosome of Thermus thermophilus. Apart from the 
canonical binding site at the mRNA decoding center, the second binding site for 
sarecycline exists at the nascent peptide exit tunnel, reminiscent of the 
macrolides class of antibiotics. The structure also revealed Cutibacterium 
acnes-specific features of the ribosomal RNA and proteins. Unlike the ribosome 
of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, Cutibacterium acnes ribosome 
has two additional proteins, bS22 and bL37, which are also present in the 
ribosomes of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We show 
that bS22 and bL37 have antimicrobial properties and may be involved in 
maintaining the healthy homeostasis of the human skin microbiome.
