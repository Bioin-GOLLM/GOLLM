Caffeine (CAF) has been reported to improve various facets associated with 
successful soccer play, including gross motor skill performance, endurance 
capacity and cognition. These benefits are primarily attributed to 
pharmacological mechanisms. However, evidence assessing CAF's overall effects on 
soccer performance are sparse with no studies accounting for CAF's potential 
psychological impact. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess CAF's 
psychological vs. pharmacological influence on various facets of simulated 
soccer performance. Utilising a double-dissociation design, eight male 
recreational soccer players (age: 22 ± 5 years, body mass: 78 ± 16 kg, height: 
178 ± 6 cm) consumed CAF (3 mg/kg/body mass) or placebo (PLA) capsules, 60 
minutes prior to performing the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test (LIST) 
interspersed with a collection of ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), blood 
glucose and lactate, heart rate and performing the Loughborough Soccer Passing 
Test (LSPT). Whole-body dynamic reaction time (DRT) was assessed pre- and post- 
LIST, and endurance capacity (TLIM) post, time-matched LIST. Statistical 
analysis was performed using IBM SPSS (v24) whilst subjective perceptions were 
explored using template analysis. Mean TLIM was greatest (p < 0.001) for 
synergism (given CAF/told CAF) (672 ± 132 s) vs. placebo (given PLA/told PLA) 
(533 ± 79 s). However, when isolated, TLIM was greater (p = 0.012) for CAF 
psychology (given PLA/told CAF) (623 ± 117 s) vs. pharmacology (given CAF/told 
PLA) (578 ± 99 s), potentially, via reduced RPE. Although DRT performance was 
greater (p = 0.024) post-ingestion (+5 hits) and post-exercise (+7 hits) for 
pharmacology vs. placebo, psychology and synergism appeared to improve LSPT 
performance vs. pharmacology. Interestingly, positive perceptions during 
psychology inhibited LSPT and DRT performance via potential CAF over-reliance, 
with the opposite occurring following negative perceptions. The benefits 
associated with CAF expectancies may better suit tasks that entail lesser 
cognitive-/skill-specific attributes but greater gross motor function and this 
is likely due to reduced RPE. In isolation, these effects appear greater vs. CAF 
pharmacology. However, an additive benefit may be observed after combining 
expectancy with CAF pharmacology (i.e. synergism).
