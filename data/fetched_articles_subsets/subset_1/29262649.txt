TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) is the catalytic component of 
telomerase. TERT shows little expression in normal somatic cells but is commonly 
re-expressed in cancers, facilitating immortalization. Recently-discovered TERT 
promoter mutations create binding sites for ETS-family transcription factors to 
upregulate TERT. ETS1 is reported to be important for TERT upregulation in 
melanoma. However it is unclear when in melanoma progression TERT and ETS1 
proteins are expressed. To elucidate this question, ETS1 and TERT 
immunohistochemistry were performed on a panel of benign (n=27) and dysplastic 
nevi (n=34), radial growth phase (n=29), vertical growth phase (n=25) and 
metastatic melanomas (n=27). Lesions were scored by percentage of positive 
cells. ETS1 was readily detectable in all lesions, but not in normal 
melanocytes. TERT was located in either the nucleolus, the nucleoplasm 
(non-nucleolar) or both. Non-nucleolar TERT increased in prevalence with 
progression, from 19% of benign nevi to 78% of metastases. It did not however 
correlate with cell proliferation (Ki-67 immunostaining), nor differ 
significantly in prevalence between primary melanomas with or without a TERT 
promoter mutation. These results demonstrate that ETS1 is expressed very early 
in melanoma progression, and interestingly only non-nucleolar TERT correlates 
clearly in prevalence with melanoma progression. It can be acquired at various 
stages and by mechanisms other than promoter mutations.
