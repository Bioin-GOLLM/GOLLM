Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and memory are dependent on new 
protein synthesis. Recent advances obtained from genetic, physiological, 
pharmacological, and biochemical studies provide strong evidence that 
translational control plays a key role in regulating long-term changes in neural 
circuits and thus long-term modifications in behavior. Translational control is 
important for regulating both general protein synthesis and synthesis of 
specific proteins in response to neuronal activity. In this review, we summarize 
and discuss recent progress in the field and highlight the prospects for better 
understanding of long-lasting changes in synaptic strength, learning, and memory 
and implications for neurological diseases.
