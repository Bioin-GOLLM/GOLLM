Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease caused by the interaction of genetics and 
the environment that can lead to chronic damage to many organ systems. 
Genome-wide association studies have identified accumulating single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms related to type 2 diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes 
mellitus. Genetic risk score (GRS) has been utilized to evaluate the incidence 
risk to improve prediction and optimize treatments. This article reviews the 
research progress in the use of the GRS in diabetes mellitus in recent years and 
discusses future prospects.
