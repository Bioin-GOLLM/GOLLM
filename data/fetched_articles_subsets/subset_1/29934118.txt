Mutations in MYH2 that encodes myosin heavy chain IIa cause both dominant and 
recessively inherited myopathies. Patients with dominantly inherited MYH2 
missense mutations present with ophthalmoplegia and progressive proximal limb 
weakness. Muscle biopsy reveals rimmed vacuoles and inclusions, prompting this 
entity to initially be described as hereditary inclusion body myopathy 3. In 
contrast, patients with recessive MYH2 mutations have early onset, 
non-progressive, diffuse weakness and ophthalmoplegia. Muscle biopsy reveals 
near or complete absence of type 2A fibers with no vacuole or inclusion 
pathology. We describe a patient with childhood onset ophthalmoplegia, 
progressive proximal muscle weakness beginning in adolescence, and muscle biopsy 
with myopathic changes and rimmed vacuoles. Although this patient's disease 
course and histopathology is consistent with dominant MYH2 mutations, whole 
exome sequencing revealed a c.737 G>A p.Arg246His homozygous MYH2 variant. These 
findings expand the clinical and pathologic phenotype of recessive MYH2 
myopathies.
