Here, we use a cell surface thrombin cleavage assay to investigate directly the 
role of NSF in the surface delivery and synaptic accumulation of 
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors. In cultured 
hippocampal neurons, the GluR2 subunit (which specifically interacts with NSF) 
inserts rapidly into the plasma membrane from intracellular compartments and 
accumulates in synaptic sites. In contrast, surface accumulation of GluR3 (a 
subunit that does not interact with NSF) or a GluR2 mutant defective in NSF 
binding (DeltaA849-Q853) occurs initially at extrasynaptic sites and is 
kinetically slower than wild-type GluR2. Introducing a binding site for NSF into 
GluR3 (GluR3NSF) generates a subunit that behaves like GluR2 in terms of 
kinetics and site of surface insertion. These data suggest that the NSF 
interaction is necessary for rapid incorporation of AMPA receptor subunits into 
synapses and is sufficient to confer this property on GluR3.
