Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs 
mainly in girls with a range of typical symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. 
MeCP2 protein loss-of-function in neural lineage cells is the main cause of RTT 
pathogenicity. As it is still hard to understand the mechanism of RTT on the 
basis of only clinical patients or animal models, cell models cultured in vitro 
play indispensable roles. Here we reviewed the research progress in the 
pathogenesis of RTT at the cellular level, summarized the 
preclinical-research-related applications, and prospected potential future 
development.
