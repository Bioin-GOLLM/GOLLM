BACKGROUND: Furin is the key enzyme involved in the cleavage of pro-BNP and 
plays a critical role in the cardiovascular system through its involvement in 
lipid metabolism, blood pressure regulation and the formation of atheromatous 
plaques. NT-proBNP and recently, corin, also a key enzyme in the cleavage of 
pro-BNP, have been accepted as predictors of prognosis after acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI). This cohort study was conducted to investigate the 
relationship between plasma furin and the prognostic outcomes of AMI patients.
METHODS: In total, 1100 AMI patients were enrolled in the study and their plasma 
furin concentrations were measured. The primary endpoint was major adverse 
cardiac events (MACE), a composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke. The associations between plasma 
furin concentration and AMI outcomes were explored using Kaplan-Meier curves and 
multivariate Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: The results showed a slight increase in mean cTNT in patients with 
higher furin concentrations (P = 0.016). Over a median follow-up of 31 months, 
multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that plasma furin was not 
significantly associated with MACE (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.93-1.06; P = 0.807) after 
adjustment for potential conventional risk factors. However, plasma furin was 
associated with non-fatal MI (HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01-1.17; P = 0.022) in the fully 
adjusted model. Subgroup analyses indicated no relationship between plasma furin 
and MACE in different subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found no association between plasma furin and risk of 
MACE. Thus, plasma furin may not be a useful predictor of poor prognosis after 
AMI. However, higher levels of plasma furin may be associated with a higher risk 
of recurrent non-fatal MI.
