BACKGROUND: Special Operations Forces (SOF) Soldiers deploy frequently and 
require high levels of physical and cognitive performance. Nutritional status is 
linked to cognitive and physical performance. Studies evaluating dietary intake 
and nutritional status in deployed environments are lacking. Therefore, this 
study assessed the effects of combat deployment on diet quality and serum 
concentrations of nutritional status markers, including iron, vitamin D, 
parathyroid hormone (PTH), glucose, and lipids, among elite United States (U.S.) 
Army SOF Soldiers.
METHODS: Changes from baseline to post-deployment were determined with a 
repeated measure within-subjects design for Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) 
scores, intake of foods, food groups, key nutrients, and serum nutritional 
status markers. Dietary intake was assessed with a Block Food Frequency 
Questionnaire. The association between post-deployment serum 25-hydroxy vitamin 
D (25-OH vitamin D) and PTH was determined. Analyses of serum markers were 
completed on 50 participants and analyses of dietary intake were completed on 33 
participants.
RESULTS: In response to deployment, HEI-2010 scores decreased for total HEI-2010 
(70.3 ± 9.1 vs. 62.9 ± 11.1), total fruit (4.4 ± 1.1 vs. 3.7 ± 1.5), whole fruit 
(4.6 ± 1.0 vs. 4.2 ± 1.4), dairy (6.2 ± 2.7 vs. 4.8 ± 2.4), and empty calories 
(14.3 ± 3.2 vs. 11.1 ± 4.5) (P ≤ 0.05). Average daily intakes of foods and food 
groups that decreased included total dairy (P < 0.01), milk (P < 0.01), and 
non-juice fruit (P = 0.03). Dietary intake of calcium (P = 0.05) and vitamin D 
(P = 0.03) decreased. PTH increased from baseline (3.4 ± 1.6 vs. 
3.8 ± 1.4 pmol/L, P = 0.04), while there was no change in 25-OH vitamin D. 
Ferritin decreased (385 ± 173 vs. 354 ± 161 pmol/L, P = 0.03) and soluble 
transferrin receptor increased (16.3 ± 3.7 vs. 17.1 ± 3.5 nmol/L, P = 0.01). 
There were no changes in glucose or lipids. Post-deployment, serum 25-OH vitamin 
D was inversely associated with PTH (r = -0.43, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: HEI-2010 scores and dietary intake of milk, calcium, and vitamin D 
decreased following deployment. Serum PTH increased and iron stores were 
degraded. No Soldiers were iron deficient. Personnel that deploy frequently 
should maintain a high diet quality in the U.S. and while deployed by avoiding 
empty calories and consuming fruits, vegetables, and adequate sources of 
calcium, vitamin D, and iron. Improving availability and quality of perishable 
food during deployment may improve diet quality.
