European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

In July 2019, the European Commission asked EFSA to provide a statement on the 
available outcomes of the human health assessment in the context of the 
pesticides peer review for the renewal of approval of the active substance 
chlorpyrifos conducted in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation 
(EC) No 844/2012. The current statement contains a summary of the main findings 
of the assessment related to human health following the pesticides peer review 
expert discussions in mammalian toxicology held between 1 and 5 April 2019, as 
well as EFSA's additional considerations, including whether the active substance 
can be expected to meet the approval criteria applicable to human health as laid 
down in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The identified concerns are 
presented as follows.
