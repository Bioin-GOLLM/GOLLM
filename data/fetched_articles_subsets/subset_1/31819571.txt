BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder resulting 
from insulin insufficiency or function. Predisposing factors for T2DM are mainly 
genetic and environmental. Genetic polymorphism of cytokines like tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α) is suggestive of interference with insulin-sensitive 
glucose uptake and induces insulin resistance that ultimately could lead to 
T2DM. In this study, we assessed the effect of TNF-α (-308) G/A gene 
polymorphism and its association with the development of T2DM in an Ethiopian 
population.
METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted on study 
subjects with T2DM and non-diabetic healthy controls. DNA was extracted and 
genotyping was carried out by using amplification refractory mutation system 
polymerase chain reaction. A genetic-polymorphism on TNF-α (-308) G/A with T2DM 
was evaluated by logistic regression and Student's t-test. A P-value <0.05 was 
considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS: In the present study, we observed a significant association between 
T2DM and TNF-α (-308) gene polymorphism's GG genotype [χ2 test P = 0.005, OR 
(95% CI) =2.667 (1.309-5.45d8)]. In contrast, no statistically significant 
differences were observed in the frequencies of genotypes AA and AG (χ2 test 
P=0.132 and 0.067, respectively). Moreover, T2DM individuals had higher 
concentrations of lipid profiles for those carrying the TNF-α (-308) GG genotype 
as compared to the control group.
CONCLUSION: TNF-α (-308) genetic polymorphism may be implicated in the genetic 
susceptibility for, as well as the development of T2DM and lipid metabolism in 
the Ethiopian population. Therefore, a large-scale study and early screening of 
TNF-α (-308) genetic polymorphism may help in early management and control of 
diabetes and related outcomes.
