We describe a patient with early onset severe axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 
(CMT2) with dominant inheritance, in whom Sanger sequencing failed to detect a 
mutation in the mitofusin 2 (MFN2) gene because of a single nucleotide 
polymorphism (rs2236057) under the PCR primer sequence. The severe early onset 
phenotype and the family history with severely affected mother (died after 
delivery) was very suggestive of CMT2A and this suspicion was finally confirmed 
by a MFN2 mutation. The mutation p.His361Tyr was later detected in the patient 
by massively parallel sequencing with a gene panel for hereditary neuropathies. 
According to this information, new primers for amplification and sequencing were 
designed which bind away from the polymorphic sites of the patient's DNA. Sanger 
sequencing with these new primers then confirmed the heterozygous mutation in 
the MFN2 gene in this patient. This case report shows that massively parallel 
sequencing may in some rare cases be more sensitive than Sanger sequencing and 
highlights the importance of accurate primer design which requires special 
attention.
