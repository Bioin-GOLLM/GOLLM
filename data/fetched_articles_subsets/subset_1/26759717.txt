BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the sixth most lethal 
cancer worldwide and the fourth most lethal cancer in China. Genomic 
characterization of tumors, particularly those of different stages, is likely to 
reveal additional oncogenic mechanisms. Although copy number alterations and 
somatic point mutations associated with the development of ESCC have been 
identified by array-based technologies and genome-wide studies, the genomic 
characterization of ESCCs from different stages of the disease has not been 
explored. Here, we have performed either whole-genome sequencing or whole-exome 
sequencing on 51 stage I and 53 stage III ESCC patients to characterize the 
genomic alterations that occur during the various clinical stages of ESCC, and 
further validated these changes in 36 atypical hyperplasia samples.
RESULTS: Recurrent somatic amplifications at 8q were found to be enriched in 
stage I tumors and the deletions of 4p-q and 5q were particularly identified in 
stage III tumors. In particular, the FAM84B gene was amplified and overexpressed 
in preclinical and ESCC tumors. Knockdown of FAM84B in ESCC cell lines 
significantly reduced in vitro cell growth, migration and invasion. Although the 
cancer-associated genes TP53, PIK3CA, CDKN2A and their pathways showed no 
significant difference between stage I and stage III tumors, we identified and 
validated a prevalence of mutations in NOTCH1 and in the NOTCH pathway that 
indicate that they are involved in the preclinical and early stages of ESCC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that FAM84B and the NOTCH pathway are involved 
in the progression of ESCC and may be potential diagnostic targets for ESCC 
susceptibility.
