During DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, the ring-shaped Ku70/80 complex 
becomes trapped on DNA and needs to be actively extracted, but it has remained 
unclear what provides the required energy. By means of reconstitution of DSB 
repair on beads, we demonstrate here that DNA-locked Ku rings are released by 
the AAA-ATPase p97. To achieve this, p97 requires ATP hydrolysis, cooperates 
with the Ufd1-Npl4 ubiquitin-adaptor complex, and specifically targets Ku80 that 
is modified by K48-linked ubiquitin chains. In U2OS cells, chemical inhibition 
of p97 or siRNA-mediated depletion of p97 or its adapters impairs Ku80 removal 
after non-homologous end joining of DSBs. Moreover, this inhibition attenuates 
early steps in homologous recombination, consistent with p97-driven Ku release 
also affecting repair pathway choice. Thus, our data answer a central question 
regarding regulation of Ku in DSB repair and illustrate the ability of p97 to 
segregate even tightly bound protein complexes for release from DNA.
