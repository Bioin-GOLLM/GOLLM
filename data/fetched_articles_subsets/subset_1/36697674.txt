Rhodoquinone (RQ) is a close analogue of ubiquinone (UQ) that confers diverse 
bacterial and eukaryotic taxa the ability to utilize fumarate as an electron 
acceptor in hypoxic conditions. The RquA protein, identified in a Rhodospirillum 
rubrum RQ-deficient mutant, has been shown to be required for RQ biosynthesis in 
bacteria. In this report, we demonstrate that RquA, homologous to SAM-dependent 
methyltransferases, is necessary and sufficient to catalyze RQ biosynthesis from 
UQ in vitro. Remarkably, we show that RquA uses SAM as the amino group donor in 
a substitution reaction that converts UQ to RQ. In contrast to known 
aminotransferases, RquA does not use pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme, 
but requires the presence of Mn2+ as a cofactor. As these findings reveal, RquA 
provides an example of a non-canonical SAM-dependent enzyme that does not 
catalyze methyl transfer, instead it uses SAM in an atypical amino transfer 
mechanism.
