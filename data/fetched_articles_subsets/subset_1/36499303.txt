In plants, guanosine deaminase (GSDA) catalyzes the deamination of guanosine for 
nitrogen recycling and re-utilization. We previously solved crystal structures 
of GSDA from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGSDA) and identified several novel 
substrates for this enzyme, but the structural basis of the enzyme 
activation/inhibition is poorly understood. Here, we continued to solve 8 
medium-to-high resolution (1.85-2.60 Ã…) cocrystal structures, which involved 
AtGSDA and its variants bound by a few ligands, and investigated their binding 
modes through structural studies and thermal shift analysis. Besides the lack of 
a 2-amino group of these guanosine derivatives, we discovered that AtGSDA's 
inactivity was due to the its inability to seclude its active site. Furthermore, 
the C-termini of the enzyme displayed conformational diversities under certain 
circumstances. The lack of functional amino groups or poor 
interactions/geometries of the ligands at the active sites to meet the precise 
binding and activation requirements for deamination both contributed to AtGSDA's 
inactivity toward the ligands. Altogether, our combined structural and 
biochemical studies provide insight into GSDA.
