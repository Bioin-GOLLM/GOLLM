Several cytochrome P450 (CYP) CYP3A polymorphisms were associated with reduced 
enzyme function. We aimed to evaluate the influence of these alleles on the 
pharmacokinetic parameters (PK) of several CYP3A substrates. We included 251 
healthy volunteers who received a single dose of ambrisentan, atorvastatin, 
imatinib, aripiprazole, fentanyl, amlodipine, donepezil, olanzapine, 
fesoterodine, or quetiapine. The volunteers were genotyped for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 
polymorphisms by qPCR. To compare the PK across studies, measurements were 
corrected by the mean of each parameter for every drug and were logarithmically 
transformed. Neither CYP3A phenotype nor individual CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 
polymorphisms were significantly associated with differences in PK. However, 
regarding the substrates that are exclusively metabolized by CYP3A, we observed 
a higher normalized AUC (p = 0.099) and a tendency of lower normalized Cl (p = 
0.069) in CYP3A4 mutated allele carriers what was associated with diminished 
drug metabolism capacity. CYP3A4 polymorphisms did not show a pronounced 
influence on PK of the analysed drugs. If so, their impact could be detectable 
in a very small percentage of subjects. Although there are few subjects carrying 
CYP3A4 double mutations, the effect in those might be relevant, especially due 
to the majority of subjects lacking the CYP3A5 enzyme. In heterozygous subjects, 
the consequence might be less noticeable due to the high inducible potential of 
the CYP3A4 enzyme.
