OBJECTIVE: To systemically investigate the association between the polymorphism 
(rs3118869) in cathepsin Lenzyme gene with hypertension in three ethnic groups 
(Han, Kazak and Uygur) in China.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated 
Hospital, Shihezi Medical College, Shihezi University and Department of Internal 
Medicine and Genetic Diagnosis Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, 
Huazhong University of Science and Technology, from January 2013 to May 2014.
METHODOLOGY: This case-control study included 1224 patients (422 Uygur, 425 
Kazak and 377 Han individuals) with hypertension and 967 healthy unrelated 
individuals (339 Uygur, 337 Kazak and 291 Han individuals) as controls. The 
participants came from three ethnic groups (Han, Kazak and Uygur) which were 
recruited from Xinjiang Province of China. The polymorphism (rs3118869) of the 
human cathepsin Lgene was genotyped using the TaqMan 5' nuclease assay. Binary 
logistic regression was built to determine the association of polymorphism with 
hypertension.
RESULTS: The genotype distribution of polymorphism was not significantly 
different in three ethnic groups. The rs3118869 polymorphism was significantly 
associated with Essential Hypertension (EH) in co-dominant model (A/C vs. C/C) 
in total people (OR = 0.697, 95% CI = 0.520 -0.932, p = 0.015), the same result 
was obtained in recessive model (C/C + A/C vs. A/A) in total people (OR = 0.689, 
95% CI = 0.522 -0.910, p = 0.009). Similar finding of rs3118869 in recessive 
model (C/C + A/C vs. A/A) was also observed after adjusting the variable to the 
covariates age (OR = 0.629, 95% CI = 0.464 0853, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: The study results indicate the A-allele of rs3118869 is a protective 
factor in hypertension.
