Vitamin D or calciferol is a fat-soluble vitamin that has a unique feature of 
synthesizing in the body mainly by exposure to UV from the sunlight and then 
transformed to 25 (OH) D by the liver and finally to a vital form 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the kidneys. Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism 
(FokI-rs2228570) has been proposed as the major cause of anemia. The present 
study aimed to discover the association between vitamin D deficiency and vitamin 
D receptor gene polymorphism (FokI-rs2228570) in patients with anemia. A total 
of 120 men with anemia and no kidney disorders have been compared with 60 
healthy controls in the present case-control study. A single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) FokI-rs2228570 was detected by PCR and PCR-RFLP techniques. 
Levels of serum vitamin D, erythropoietin, and some biochemical parameters were 
detected by the ELISA assay technique. The mutant homozygous genotype ff was 
more frequent in patients with anemia (45%) than in the controls (15%). Also, 
the frequency of the f allele was associated with a significant decrease in the 
levels of vitamin D and hemoglobin in patients (0.62%); therefore, the mutant 
allele is a risk factor for developing anemia compared with genetic patterns FF 
and Ff. Vitamin D deficiency is common in those with anemia which is often 
associated with low hemoglobin and high levels of erythropoietin. Additionally, 
the genetic frequencies also affect the level of vitamin D which is indicated by 
low levels of mutant patterns (Ff, ff) in which patients suffer from severe 
anemia.
