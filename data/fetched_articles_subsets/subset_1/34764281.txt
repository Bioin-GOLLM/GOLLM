Infantile-onset RNaseT2 deficient leukoencephalopathy is characterised by cystic 
brain lesions, multifocal white matter alterations, cerebral atrophy, and severe 
psychomotor impairment. The phenotype is similar to congenital cytomegalovirus 
brain infection and overlaps with type I interferonopathies, suggesting a role 
for innate immunity in its pathophysiology. To date, pathophysiological studies 
have been hindered by the lack of mouse models recapitulating the 
neuroinflammatory encephalopathy found in patients. In this study, we generated 
Rnaset2-/- mice using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Rnaset2-/- mice 
demonstrate upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes and concurrent 
IFNAR1-dependent neuroinflammation, with infiltration of CD8+ effector memory T 
cells and inflammatory monocytes into the grey and white matter. Single nuclei 
RNA sequencing reveals homeostatic dysfunctions in glial cells and neurons and 
provide important insights into the mechanisms of hippocampal-accentuated brain 
atrophy and cognitive impairment. The Rnaset2-/- mice may allow the study of CNS 
damage associated with RNaseT2 deficiency and may be used for the investigation 
of potential therapies.
