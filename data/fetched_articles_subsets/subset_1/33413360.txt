BACKGROUND: CircRNAs play crucial roles in multiple tumours. However, the 
functions of most circRNAs in cervical cancer remain unclear.
METHODS: This study collected GSE113696 data from the GEO database to search for 
differentially expressed circRNAs in cervical cancer. Quantitative reverse 
transcription PCR was used to detect the expression level of circNEIL3 in 
cervical cancer cells and tissues. Then, functional experiments in vitro and in 
vivo were performed to evaluate the effects of circNEIL3 in cervical cancer.
RESULTS: CircNEIL3 was highly expressed in cervical cancer. In vivo and in vitro 
experiments verified that circNEIL3 enhanced the proliferation capacity of 
cervical cancer cells. RNA immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assay, 
pull-down assay, and fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmed the interaction 
between circNEIL3 and miR-137 in cervical cancer. A luciferase reporter assay 
showed that circNEIL3 adsorbed miR-137 and upregulated KLF12 to regulate the 
proliferation of cervical cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: CircNEIL3 is an oncogene in cervical cancer and might serve as a 
ceRNA that competitively binds to miR-137, thereby indirectly upregulating the 
expression of KLF12 and promoting the proliferation of cervical cancer cells.
