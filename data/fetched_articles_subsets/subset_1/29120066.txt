Rod-cone dystrophy (RCD), also called retinitis pigmentosa, is the most common 
form of progressive inherited retinal disorders secondary to photoreceptor 
degeneration. It is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by night 
blindness, followed by visual field constriction and, in most severe cases, 
total blindness. The aim of our study was to identify the underlying gene defect 
leading to severe RCD in a 60-year-old woman. The patient's DNA was investigated 
by targeted next generation sequencing followed by whole exome sequencing. A 
novel nonsense variant, c.267G>A p.(Trp89*), was identified at a homozygous 
state in the proband in REEP6 gene, recently reported mutated in 7 unrelated 
families with RCD. Further functional studies will help to understand the 
physiopathology associated with REEP6 mutations that may be linked to a protein 
trafficking defect.
