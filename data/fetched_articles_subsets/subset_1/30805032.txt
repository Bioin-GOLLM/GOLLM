BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the 
gastric mucosa in humans. One of the main virulence factors of H. pylori is the 
cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI), which encodes a type 4-secretion system 
(T4SS) and the cytotoxin CagA. Translocation of CagA through the T4SS triggers 
host-signaling pathways. One of the T4SS proteins is CagL, which is necessary 
for CagA translocation. CagL is a 26-kDa protein that contains a hypervariable 
motif, which spans residues 58 to 62. Several polymorphisms in this region have 
been associated with different disease outcomes, e.g. in Mexico, N58 is 
associated with a higher risk of gastric cancer. The aim of this work is to 
analyze the sequence of the hypervariable motif (residues 58 to 62) of clinical 
isolates from Mexican patients with chronic gastritis, and to correlate these 
polymorphisms with the vacA genotype.
RESULTS: Of the 164 biopsies analyzed, only 30.5% (50/164) were positive for H. 
pylori. Thirty-six of the 50 clinical isolates (72%) were cagA positive, and 40 
(80%) had the most virulent vacA genotype (s1/m1). Of the cagA positive strains, 
94.4% were vacA s1/m1. All the cagA + strains contained the cagL gene. The most 
prevalent sequence in the polymorphic region (residues 58-62) was DKMGE (75.8%, 
25/33), followed by NKMGQ and NEIGQ (6.1%, 2/33), and DEIGQ, NKMGE, DKIGE, and 
DKIGK (3%, 1/33). Regarding polymorphisms in positions 58 and 59, the most 
common were D58/K59 (81.8%, 27/33), followed by N58/K59 (9.1%, 3/33), and 
D58/E59 (3%, 1/33). Only two isolates (6.1%) contained residues N58/E59, which 
correspond to those found in H. pylori strain ATCC 26695. 92.6% of the clinical 
isolates having polymorphism D58/K59 had the genotype vacA s1/m1, considered to 
be the most virulent, while 7.4% had the genotypes vacA s1/m2 and s2/m2.
CONCLUSIONS: In Mexican patients, CagL polymorphisms D58, K59, M60, E62, K122, 
and I134 are more common in patients with chronic gastritis.
