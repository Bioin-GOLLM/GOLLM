Many cellular functions in eukaryotic pathogens are mediated by the cyclic 
nucleotide binding (CNB) domain, which senses second messengers such as cyclic 
AMP and cyclic GMP. Although CNB domain-containing proteins have been identified 
in many pathogenic organisms, an incomplete understanding of how CNB domains in 
pathogens differ from other eukaryotic hosts has hindered the development of 
selective inhibitors for CNB domains associated with infectious diseases. Here, 
we identify and classify CNB domain-containing proteins in eukaryotic genomes to 
understand the evolutionary basis for CNB domain functional divergence in 
pathogens. We identify 359 CNB domain-containing proteins in 31 pathogenic 
organisms and classify them into distinct subfamilies based on sequence 
similarity within the CNB domain as well as functional domains associated with 
the CNB domain. Our study reveals novel subfamilies with pathogen-specific 
variations in the phosphate-binding cassette. Analyzing these variations in 
light of existing structural and functional data provides new insights into 
ligand specificity and promiscuity and clues for drug design. This article is 
part of a Special Issue entitled: Inhibitors of Protein Kinases.
