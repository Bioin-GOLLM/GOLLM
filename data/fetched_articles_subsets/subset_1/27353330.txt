LRPPRC is a protein that has attracted interest both for its role in 
post-transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial gene expression and more 
recently because numerous mutated variants have been characterized as causing 
severe infantile mitochondrial neurodegeneration. LRPPRC belongs to the 
pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family, originally defined by their RNA 
binding capacity, and forms a complex with SLIRP that harbours an RNA 
recognition motif (RRM) domain. We show here that LRPPRC displays a broad and 
strong RNA binding capacity in vitro in contrast to SLIRP that associates only 
weakly with RNA. The LRPPRC-SLIRP complex comprises a hetero-dimer via 
interactions by polar amino acids in the single RRM domain of SLIRP and three 
neighbouring PPR motifs in the second quarter of LRPPRC, which critically 
contribute to the LRPPRC-SLIRP binding interface to enhance its stability. 
Unexpectedly, specific amino acids at this interface are located within the PPRs 
of LRPPRC at positions predicted to interact with RNA and within the RNP1 motif 
of SLIRP's RRM domain. Our findings thus unexpectedly establish that despite the 
prediction that these residues in LRPPRC and SLIRP should bind RNA, they are 
instead used to facilitate protein-protein interactions, enabling the formation 
of a stable complex between these two proteins.
