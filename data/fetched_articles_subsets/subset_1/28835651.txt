Brain-computer interface-assisted motor imagery (MI-BCI) or transcranial direct 
current stimulation (tDCS) has been used in stroke rehabilitation, though their 
combinatory effect is unknown. We investigated brain plasticity following a 
combined MI-BCI and tDCS intervention in chronic subcortical stroke patients 
with unilateral upper limb disability. Nineteen patients were randomized into 
tDCS and sham-tDCS groups. Diffusion and perfusion MRI, and transcranial 
magnetic stimulation were used to study structural connectivity, cerebral blood 
flow (CBF), and corticospinal excitability, respectively, before and 4 weeks 
after the 2-week intervention. After quality control, thirteen subjects were 
included in the CBF analysis. Eleven healthy controls underwent 2 sessions of 
MRI for reproducibility study. Whereas motor performance showed comparable 
improvement, long-lasting neuroplasticity can only be detected in the tDCS 
group, where white matter integrity in the ipsilesional corticospinal tract and 
bilateral corpus callosum was increased but sensorimotor CBF was decreased, 
particularly in the ipsilesional side. CBF change in the bilateral parietal 
cortices also correlated with motor function improvement, consistent with the 
increased white matter integrity in the corpus callosum connecting these 
regions, suggesting an involvement of interhemispheric interaction. The 
preliminary results indicate that tDCS may facilitate neuroplasticity and 
suggest the potential for refining rehabilitation strategies for stroke 
patients.
