Przewalski's horses (PHs, Equus ferus ssp. przewalskii) were discovered in the 
Asian steppes in the 1870s and represent the last remaining true wild horses. 
PHs became extinct in the wild in the 1960s but survived in captivity, thanks to 
major conservation efforts. The current population is still endangered, with 
just 2,109 individuals, one-quarter of which are in Chinese and Mongolian 
reintroduction reserves [1]. These horses descend from a founding population of 
12 wild-caught PHs and possibly up to four domesticated individuals [2-4]. With 
a stocky build, an erect mane, and stripped and short legs, they are 
phenotypically and behaviorally distinct from domesticated horses (DHs, Equus 
caballus). Here, we sequenced the complete genomes of 11 PHs, representing all 
founding lineages, and five historical specimens dated to 1878-1929 CE, 
including the Holotype. These were compared to the hitherto-most-extensive 
genome dataset characterized for horses, comprising 21 new genomes. We found 
that loci showing the most genetic differentiation with DHs were enriched in 
genes involved in metabolism, cardiac disorders, muscle contraction, 
reproduction, behavior, and signaling pathways. We also show that DH and PH 
populations split ∼45,000 years ago and have remained connected by gene-flow 
thereafter. Finally, we monitor the genomic impact of ∼110 years of captivity, 
revealing reduced heterozygosity, increased inbreeding, and variable 
introgression of domestic alleles, ranging from non-detectable to as much as 
31.1%. This, together with the identification of ancestry informative markers 
and corrections to the International Studbook, establishes a framework for 
evaluating the persistence of genetic variation in future reintroduced 
populations.
