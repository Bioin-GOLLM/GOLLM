BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is more common among patients with schizophrenia and 
depression than among healthy individuals. We tested the hypothesis that high 
tobacco smoking intensity is causally associated with antipsychotic medication 
use, schizophrenia, antidepressant medication use and/or depression in the 
general population, and compared results with those for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease.
METHODS: We used self-reported smoking intensity in cigarettes/day and a 
polymorphism in the CHRNA3 gene cluster (rs1051730) associated with smoking 
intensity, on 63,296 20-100-year-old individuals from the Danish general 
population; 23,282 were never-smokers and 40,014 ever-smokers. For 
schizophrenia, we compared our results with those in the Psychiatric Genomics 
Consortium.
RESULTS: In smokers, heterozygotes (CT) and homozygotes (TT) for rs1051730 
genotype had higher smoking intensity compared with non-carriers (CC). 
Furthermore, in ever-smokers homozygotes had increased risk of antipsychotic 
medication with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.16 [95% confidence interval (CI) 
1.02-1.31] compared with non-carriers, whereas in never-smokers the 
corresponding OR was 1.07 (0.87-1.31) (P-interaction: 0.60). Correspondingly, 
ORs were 1.60 (0.74-3.47) and 1.02 (0.11-9.10) for schizophrenia (P-interaction: 
0.85), 1.02 (0.93-1.13) and 0.99 (0.85-1.15) for antidepressant medication 
(P-interaction: 0.87), 0.85 (0.66-1.10) and 1.26 (0.87-1.83) for depression 
(P-interaction: 0.30) and 1.31 (1.16-1.47) and 0.89 (0.58-1.36) for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (P-interaction: 0.16). Odds ratios per rs1051730 
allele for schizophrenia and antipsychotic medication use in ever-smokers in the 
general population were 1.22 (95% CI: 0.84-1.79) and 1.06 (1.00-1.12). In the 
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, the corresponding OR for schizophrenia was 1.06 
(1.04-1.08) in ever- and never-smokers combined.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that tobacco smoking could influence the 
development of psychotic conditions causally, whereas an influence on depression 
seems unlikely.
