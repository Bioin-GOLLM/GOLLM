BACKGROUND: Rabies is an incurable neglected zoonosis with worldwide 
distribution characterized as a lethal progressive acute encephalitis caused by 
a lyssavirus. Animal venoms and secretions have long been studied as new 
bioactive molecular sources, presenting a wide spectrum of biological effects, 
including new antiviral agents. Bufotenine, for instance, is an alkaloid 
isolated from the skin secretion of the anuran Rhinella jimi that inhibits 
cellular penetration by the rabies virus. Antimicrobial peptides, such as 
ocellatin-P1 and ocellatin-F1, are present in the skin secretion of anurans from 
the genus Leptodactylus and provide chemical defense against predators and 
microorganisms.
METHODS: Skin secretion from captive Leptodactylus labyrinthicus was collected 
by mechanical stimulation, analyzed by liquid chromatography and mass 
spectrometry, and assayed for antiviral and cytotoxic activities. Synthetic 
peptides were obtained using solid phase peptide synthesis, purified by liquid 
chromatography and structurally characterized by mass spectrometry, and assayed 
in the same models. Cytotoxicity assays based on changes in cellular morphology 
were performed using baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. Fixed Rabies virus 
(Pasteur Virus - PV) strain was used for virological assays based on rapid 
fluorescent focus inhibition test.
RESULTS: Herein, we describe a synergic effect between ocellatin-F1 and 
bufotenine. This synergism was observed when screening the L. labyrinthicus skin 
secretion for antiviral activities. The active fraction major component was the 
antimicrobial peptide ocellatin-F1. Nevertheless, when the pure synthetic 
peptide was assayed, little antiviral activity was detectable. In-depth analyses 
of the active fraction revealed the presence of residual alkaloids together with 
ocellatin-F1. By adding sub-effective doses (e.g. < IC50) of pure bufotenine to 
synthetic ocellatin-F1, the antiviral effect was regained. Moreover, a 
tetrapetide derived from ocellatin-F1, based on alignment with the virus's 
glycoprotein region inferred as a possible cell ligand, was able to maintain the 
synergic antiviral activity displayed by the full peptide.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel antiviral synergic effect between a peptide and an 
alkaloid may present an innovative lead for the study of new antiviral drugs.
