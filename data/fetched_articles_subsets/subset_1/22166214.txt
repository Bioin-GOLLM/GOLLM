DNA damage response upon UV radiation involves a complex network of cellular 
events required for maintaining the homeostasis and restoring genomic stability 
of the cells. As a new class of players involved in DNA damage response, the 
regulation and function of microRNAs in response to UV remain poorly understood. 
Here we show that UV radiation induces a significant increase of miR-22 
expression, which appears to be dependent on the activation of DNA damage 
responding kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated). Increased miR-22 
expression may result from enhanced miR-22 maturation in cells exposed to UV. We 
further found that tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) 
expression was inversely correlated with miR-22 induction and UV-induced PTEN 
repression was attenuated by overexpression of a miR-22 inhibitor. Moreover, 
increased miR-22 expression significantly inhibited the activation of caspase 
signaling cascade, leading to enhanced cell survival upon UV radiation. 
Collectively, these results indicate that miR-22 is an important player in the 
cellular stress response upon UV radiation, which may promote cell survival via 
the repression of PTEN expression.
