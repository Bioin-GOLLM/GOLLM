AQP4ex is a recently discovered isoform of AQP4 generated by a translational 
readthrough mechanism. It is strongly expressed at the astrocyte perivascular 
endfeet as a component of the supramolecular membrane complex, commonly called 
orthogonal array of particles (OAP), together with the canonical isoforms M1 and 
M23 of AQP4. Previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggested the 
potential role of serine331 and serine335, located in the extended peptide of 
AQP4ex, in water channel activity by phosphorylation. In the present study we 
evaluated the effective phosphorylation of human AQP4ex. A small scale 
bioinformatic analysis indicated that only Ser335 is conserved in human, mouse 
and rat AQP4ex. The phosphorylation site of Ser335 was assessed through 
generation of phospho-specific antibodies in rabbits. Antibody specificity was 
first evaluated in binding phosphorylated peptide versus its unphosphorylated 
analog by ELISA, which was further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis 
experiments. Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments revealed strong 
expression of phosphorylated AQP4ex (p-AQP4ex) in human brain and localization 
at the perivascular astrocyte endfeet in supramolecular assemblies identified by 
BN/PAGE experiments. All together, these data reveal, for the first time, the 
existence of a phosphorylated form of AQP4, at Ser335 in the extended sequence 
exclusive of AQP4ex. Therefore, we anticipate an important physiological role of 
p-AQP4ex in human brain water homeostasis.
