BACKGROUND: To identify the underlying genetic defect in a fourth-generation 
autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) family. Detailed family history 
and clinical data were collected from nine members, including three affected, 
from an arRP family.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on DNA sample of an affected 
individual IV: 2. Variants obtained by WES were annotated using Ion Reporter 
Software (ver. 5.2). Potential pathogenic variants detected in an affected 
member were validated in other affected and unaffected family members by Sanger 
sequencing. Further 150 ethnically-matched controls were tested for the variant 
that co-segregated completely with disease in the family, so as to exclude it as 
a polymorphism. Various web-based bioinformatics tools were also applied to 
access pathogenic potential of the observed variant.
RESULTS: All the three patients had RP with polydactyly of both hands and feet, 
however, they did not show other symptoms of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) or 
McKusick-Kaufmann Syndrome (MKKS). A novel missense mutation, that is, c.518A>C 
(p.His173Pro) was identified in MKKS/BBS6 that co-segregated completely with the 
disease phenotype in all the three affected members and was not observed in six 
unaffected members of the family. Also the c.518A>C change was not observed in 
150 ethnically matched controls (300 chromosomes), hence excluding it as a 
polymorphism.
CONCLUSIONS: Present study is the second report of identifying a novel mutation 
in MKKS/BBS6 that is linked with arRP in association with polydactyly, however, 
with no other signs of BBS or MKKS. These findings further expand the mutation 
spectrum of MKKS/BBS6 for arRP with polydactyly.
