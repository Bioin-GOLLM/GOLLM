cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is the major receptor of the second 
messenger cAMP and a prototype for Ser/Thr-specific protein kinases. Although 
PKA strongly prefers serine over threonine substrates, little is known about the 
molecular basis of this substrate specificity. We employ classical enzyme 
kinetics and a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based method to analyze each step 
of the kinase reaction. In the absence of divalent metal ions and nucleotides, 
PKA binds serine (PKS) and threonine (PKT) substrates, derived from the 
heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI), with similar affinities. However, in 
the presence of metal ions and adenine nucleotides, the Michaelis complex for 
PKT is unstable. PKA phosphorylates PKT with a higher turnover due to a faster 
dissociation of the product complex. Thus, threonine substrates are not 
necessarily poor substrates of PKA. Mutation of the DFG+1 phenylalanine to 
β-branched amino acids increases the catalytic efficiency of PKA for a threonine 
peptide substrate up to 200-fold. The PKA Cα mutant F187V forms a stable 
Michaelis complex with PKT and shows no preference for serine versus threonine 
substrates. Disease-associated mutations of the DFG+1 position in other protein 
kinases underline the importance of substrate specificity for keeping signaling 
pathways segregated and precisely regulated.
