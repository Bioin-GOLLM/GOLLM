Ohdo syndrome-Maat-Kievit-Brunner (OSMKB) type is an X-linked recessive 
disorder, a subtype of blepharophimosis-intellectual disability syndromes caused 
by mutations in the mediator complex subunit 12 ( MED12 ) gene. Here we report a 
familial OSMKB type with two affected siblings and mutation in MED12 gene.
