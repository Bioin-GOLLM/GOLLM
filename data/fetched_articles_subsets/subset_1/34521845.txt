Vesicle tethers are thought to underpin the efficiency of intracellular fusion 
by bridging vesicles to their target membranes. However, the interplay between 
tethering and fusion has remained enigmatic. Here, through optogenetic control 
of either a natural tether-the exocyst complex-or an artificial tether, we 
report that tethering regulates the mode of fusion. We find that vesicles mainly 
undergo kiss-and-run instead of full fusion in the absence of functional 
exocyst. Full fusion is rescued by optogenetically restoring exocyst function, 
in a manner likely dependent on the stoichiometry of tether engagement with the 
plasma membrane. In contrast, a passive artificial tether produces mostly 
kissing events, suggesting that kiss-and-run is the default mode of vesicle 
fusion. Optogenetic control of tethering further shows that fusion mode has 
physiological relevance since only full fusion could trigger lamellipodial 
expansion. These findings demonstrate that active coupling between tethering and 
fusion is critical for robust membrane merger.
