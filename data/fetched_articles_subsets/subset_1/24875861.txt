The mechanisms responsible for establishing correct target innervation during 
organ development are largely unknown. Sympathetic nerves follow blood 
vessels--typically arteries--to reach their endorgans, suggesting the existence 
of vascular guidance cues that direct axonal extension. The sinoatrial node and 
the ventricle of the heart receive sympathetic innervation from the stellate 
ganglia (STG). Here we show that STG axons follow veins, specifically the 
superior vena cavae and sinus venosus, to reach these targets. We find that 
election of these routes is determined by venous endothelium-derived 
endothelin-1, acting through its specific receptor Ednra expressed within a 
subpopulation of STG neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Edn1-Ednra 
signalling is essential for functional regulation of the heart by sympathetic 
nerves. Our findings present venous Edn1 as a sympathetic guidance cue, and show 
how axon guidance mechanisms are coordinated with endorgan morphogenesis.
