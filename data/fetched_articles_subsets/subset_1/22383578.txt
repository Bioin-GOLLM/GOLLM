Nuclear receptors (NRs) regulate gene expression by binding specific DNA 
sequences consisting of AG[G/T]TCA or AGAACA half site motifs in a variety of 
configurations. However, those motifs/configurations alone do not adequately 
explain the diversity of NR function in vivo. Here, a systematic examination of 
DNA binding specificity by protein-binding microarrays (PBMs) of three closely 
related human NRs--HNF4α, retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) and COUPTF2--reveals 
an HNF4-specific binding motif (H4-SBM), xxxxCAAAGTCCA, as well as a previously 
unrecognized polarity in the classical DR1 motif (AGGTCAxAGGTCA) for HNF4α, RXRα 
and COUPTF2 homodimers. ChIP-seq data indicate that the H4-SBM is uniquely bound 
by HNF4α but not 10 other NRs in vivo, while NRs PXR, FXRα, Rev-Erbα appear to 
bind adjacent to H4-SBMs. HNF4-specific DNA recognition and transactivation are 
mediated by residues Asp69 and Arg76 in the DNA-binding domain; this combination 
of amino acids is unique to HNF4 among all human NRs. Expression profiling and 
ChIP data predict ≈ 100 new human HNF4α target genes with an H4-SBM site, 
including several Co-enzyme A-related genes and genes with links to disease. 
These results provide important new insights into NR DNA binding.
