BACKGROUND: The T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 receptor 
TIM-3 (also known as hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2, encoded by HAVCR2) 
and its ligand galectin 9 (LGALS9) are promising targets for immune checkpoint 
inhibition immunotherapies. However, little is known about epigenetic regulation 
of the encoding genes. This study aimed to investigate the association of TIM-3 
and LGALS9 DNA methylation with gene expression, patients' survival, as well as 
molecular and immune correlates in malignant melanoma.
RESULTS: Methylation of all six TIM-3 CpGs correlated significantly with TIM-3 
mRNA levels (P ≤ 0.05). A strong inverse correlation (Spearman's ρ = - 0.49) was 
found in promoter regions, while a strong positive correlation (ρ = 0.63) was 
present in the gene body of TIM-3. High TIM-3 mRNA expression (hazard ratio 
(HR) = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.81-0.97], P = 0.007) was 
significantly associated with better overall survival. Seven of the eight LGALS9 
CpG sites correlated significantly with LGALS9 mRNA levels (P ≤ 0.003). 
Methylation at five CpG sites showed a strong inverse correlation (Spearman's 
ρ = - 0.67) and at two sites a weak positive correlation (Spearman's ρ = 0.15). 
High LGALS9 mRNA expression was significantly associated with increased overall 
survival (HR = 0.83, 95%CI [0.75-0.93], P = 0.001). In addition, we found 
significant correlations between TIM-3 and LGALS9 methylation and mRNA 
expression with immune cell infiltrates and significant differences among 
distinct immune cell subsets.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study points toward an epigenetic regulation of TIM-3 and 
LGALS9 via DNA methylation and might provide an avenue for the development of a 
predictive biomarker for response to immune checkpoint blockade.
