BACKGROUND: One of the most important recent findings in cancer genomics is the 
identification of novel driver mutations which often target genes that regulate 
genome-wide chromatin and DNA methylation marks. Little is known, however, as to 
whether these genes exhibit patterns of epigenomic deregulation that transcend 
cancer types.
RESULTS: Here we conduct an integrative pan-cancer-wide analysis of matched 
RNA-Seq and DNA methylation data across ten different cancer types. We identify 
seven tumor suppressor and eleven oncogenic epigenetic enzymes which display 
patterns of deregulation and association with genome-wide cancer DNA methylation 
patterns, which are largely independent of cancer type. In doing so, we provide 
evidence that genome-wide cancer hyper- and hypo- DNA methylation patterns are 
independent processes, controlled by distinct sets of epigenetic enzyme genes. 
Using causal network modeling, we predict a number of candidate drivers of 
cancer DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation. Finally, we show that the 
genomic loci whose DNA methylation levels associate most strongly with 
expression of these putative drivers are highly consistent across cancer types.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that there exist universal patterns of 
epigenomic deregulation that transcend cancer types, and that intra-tumor levels 
of genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and hypermethylation are controlled by 
distinct processes.
