BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes are 
among the best-known and most extensively studied hereditary cancer syndromes. 
Nevertheless, many patients who proved negative at BRCA genetic testing bring 
pathogenic mutations in other suppressor genes and oncogenes associated with 
hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancers. These genes include TP53 in 
Li-Fraumeni syndrome, PTEN in Cowden syndrome, mismatch repair (MMR) genes in 
Lynch syndrome, CDH1 in diffuse gastric cancer syndrome, STK11 in Peutz-Jeghers 
syndrome, and NF1 in neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome. To these, several other 
genes can be added that act jointly with BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the double-strand 
break repair system, such as PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, NBN, BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D. 
Management of primary and secondary cancer prevention in these hereditary cancer 
syndromes is crucial. In particular, secondary prevention by screening aims to 
discover precancerous lesions or cancers at their initial stages because early 
detection could allow for effective treatment and a full recovery. The present 
review aims to summarize the available literature and suggest proper screening 
strategies for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndromes other than 
BRCA.
