AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Transmembrane protein 27 (TMEM27) is a membrane protein cleaved 
and shed by pancreatic beta cells that has been proposed as a beta cell mass 
biomarker. Despite reports of its possible role in insulin exocytosis and cell 
proliferation, its function in beta cells remains controversial. We aimed to 
characterise the function of TMEM27 in islets and its potential use as a beta 
cell mass biomarker.
METHODS: To determine TMEM27 function, we studied TMEM27 gene expression and 
localisation in human healthy and diabetic islets, the correlation of its 
expression with cell cycle and insulin secretion genes in human islets, its 
expression in tungstate-treated rats, and the effects of its overproduction on 
insulin secretion and proliferation in a beta cell line and islets. To elucidate 
its utility as a beta cell mass biomarker, we studied TMEM27 cleavage in a beta 
cell line, islets and primary proximal tubular cells.
RESULTS: TMEM27 mRNA levels in islets are lower in diabetic donors than in 
controls. Its gene expression correlates with that of insulin and SNAPIN in 
human islets. TMEM27 expression is downregulated in islets of tungstate-treated 
rats, which exhibit decreased insulin secretion and increased proliferation. 
TMEM27 overproduction in a beta cell line and islets significantly enhanced 
glucose-induced insulin secretion, with modest or no effects on proliferation. 
Finally, TMEM27 is cleaved and shed by renal proximal tubular cells and 
pancreatic islets.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data support a role for TMEM27 in 
glucose-induced insulin secretion but not in cell proliferation. The finding 
that its cleavage is not specific to beta cells challenges the current support 
for its use as a potential beta cell mass biomarker.
