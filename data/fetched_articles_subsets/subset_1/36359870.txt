BACKGROUND: Mutation of the TP53 gene is one of the major drivers of 
myelodysplastic neoplasias (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia with 
myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MR). TP53 mutations present in these 
hematopoietic malignancies form a distinct molecular genetic cluster with a 
worse prognosis than without the alteration. However, besides well-characterized 
hot-spot variants, a significant proportion of TP53 alterations are of uncertain 
clinical significance.
METHODS: To enlighten so far unknown aspects, bone-marrow samples from 
altogether 77 patients are analyzed retrospectively with the diagnosis of AML-MR 
(26 cases), MDS-IB (12 cases), and MDS-LB (39 cases) according to WHO 2022 
guidelines. Next-generation sequencing results are correlated with histological, 
cytogenetic, and survival data.
RESULTS: Twenty out of the 30 TP53 mutation types detected by NGS are not 
categorized in current public databases; thus, their clinical significance 
remained mysterious. Because of the interpretation difficulties and the absence 
of clinical correlations, pathogenicity is established based on in silico 
approaches. The 12 pathogenicity classification systems, as well as protein 
stability, protein-DNA, protein-protein interaction, and post-translational 
modification analyses are applied. We found statistically significant 
differences between AML/MDS groups considering p53 pathogenicity, protein 
structural changes, and overall survival. The largest number of abnormalities 
with the most severe consequences are found in AML-MR cases.
CONCLUSIONS: These molecular and in silico protein data further support that MDS 
with increased-blast (MDS-IB) is an intermediate group between AML-MR and MDS 
with low-blast (MDS-LB) patients, which frequently progresses to AML and is 
therefore considered a pre-leukemic condition.
