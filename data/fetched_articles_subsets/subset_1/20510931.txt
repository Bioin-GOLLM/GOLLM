Polarized trafficking of synaptic proteins to axons and dendrites is crucial to 
neuronal function. Through forward genetic analysis in C. elegans, we identified 
a cyclin (CYY-1) and a cyclin-dependent Pctaire kinase (PCT-1) necessary for 
targeting presynaptic components to the axon. Another cyclin-dependent kinase, 
CDK-5, and its activator p35, act in parallel to and partially redundantly with 
the CYY-1/PCT-1 pathway. Synaptic vesicles and active zone proteins mostly 
mislocalize to dendrites in animals defective for both PCT-1 and CDK-5 pathways. 
Unlike the kinesin-3 motor, unc-104/Kif1a mutant, cyy-1 cdk-5 double mutants 
have no reduction in anterogradely moving synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) as 
observed by dynamic imaging. Instead, the number of retrogradely moving SVPs is 
dramatically increased. Furthermore, this mislocalization defect is suppressed 
by disrupting the retrograde motor, the cytoplasmic dynein complex. Thus, PCT-1 
and CDK-5 pathways direct polarized trafficking of presynaptic components by 
inhibiting dynein-mediated retrograde transport and setting the balance between 
anterograde and retrograde motors.
