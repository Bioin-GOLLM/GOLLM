Genetic variation in specific transcription factors during heart formation may 
lead to congenital heart disease (CHD) or even miscarriage. The aim of the 
present study was to identify CHD‑associated genes using next generation 
sequencing (NGS). The whole exome DNA sequence was obtained from a stillborn 
fetus diagnosed with tricuspid atresia and complete transposition of the great 
arteries using high‑throughput sequencing methods. Subsequently, genetic 
variants of CHD‑associated genes were selected and verified in 215 non‑syndromic 
CHD patients and 249 healthy control subjects using polymerase chain reaction 
combined with Sanger sequencing. Genetic variants of previously reported 
CHD‑inducing genes, such as cysteine rich with EGF like domains 1 and 
cbp/p300‑interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp rich carboxy‑terminal domain 2, 
were discovered through the NGS analysis. In addition, a novel non‑synonymous 
mutation of the iroquois homeobox 1 (IRX1) gene (p.Gln240Glu) was identified. A 
total of three non‑synonymous mutations (p.Gln240Glu, p.Ser298Asn and 
p.Ala381Glu) of the IRX1 gene were verified in 215 non‑syndromic CHD patients, 
but not in 249 healthy volunteers. The results demonstrated that NGS is a 
powerful tool to study the etiology of CHD. In addition, the results suggest 
that genetic variants of the IRX1 gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of 
CHD.
