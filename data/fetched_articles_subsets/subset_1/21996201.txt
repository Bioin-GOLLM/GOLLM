BACKGROUND: The mechanisms of sudden cardiac death are difficult to recognize, 
but repolarization disturbances have been shown to be the cause. The purpose of 
this study was to investigate whether the polymorphism of nitric oxide synthase 
1 adaptor protein (NOS1AP) was related to the risk of occurrence of corrected 
QTc-interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias recorded on 
electrocardiography (ECG) Holter monitoring in kidney transplant recipients.
STUDY DESIGN: The 75 adult first kidney transplant patients included 43 men with 
an overall mean age of 45±12 years (range, 20-68). Additional patient monitoring 
during the procedure and in the postoperative period consisted of a continuous 
ECG tracing recording and investigation of the rs10918594 NOS1AP polymorphism.
RESULTS: We observed Transient QTc-interval prolongation during the 
perioperative period. NOS1AP genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For 
further statistical analysis, we combined GG homozygotes and CG heterozygotes 
because of the small numbers available; therefore, only a dominant mode of 
inheritance was investigated. There were no gender differences in QTc-interval 
patterns. Analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed no interaction 
between NOS1AP and QTc-interval values taken at various times among the kidney 
recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: The transplantation procedure may lead to dynamic repolarization 
disturbances, which may produce an increased risk of severe arrhythmias despite 
optimization of patient status. The NOS1AP rs203462 polymorphisms did not 
correlate with an increased risk of QT interval prolongation among kidney 
recipients.
