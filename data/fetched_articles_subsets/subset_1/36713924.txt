INTRODUCTION: Depression is a mental illness (MI) characterized by a process of 
behavioral withdrawal whereby people experience symptoms including sadness, 
anhedonia, demotivation, sleep and appetite change, and cognitive disturbances. 
Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) differs in depressive populations and may signify 
affective responses, with left FAA corresponding to such aversive or withdrawal 
type behavior. On an acute basis, exercise is known to positively alter affect 
and improve depressive symptoms and this has been measured in conjunction with 
left FAA as a post-exercise measure. It is not yet known if these affective 
electroencephalography (EEG) responses to exercise occur during exercise or only 
after completion of an exercise bout. This study therefore aimed to measure EEG 
responses during exercise in those with MI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty one participants were allocated into one of two 
groups; those undergoing management of a mental health disorder (MI; N = 19); or 
reporting as apparently healthy (AH; N = 12). EEG responses at rest and during 
incremental exercise were measured at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the motor 
cortex (MC). EEG data at PFC left side (F3, F7, FP1), PFC right side (F4, F8, 
FP2), and MC (C3, Cz, and C4) were analyzed in line with oxygen uptake at rest, 
50% of ventilatory threshold (VT) (50% VT) and at VT.
RESULTS: EEG responses increased with exercise across intensity from rest to 50% 
VT and to VT in all bandwidths (P < 0.05) for both groups. There were no 
significant differences in alpha activity responses between groups. Gamma 
responses in the PFC were significantly higher in MI on the left side compared 
to AH (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Alpha activity responses were no different between groups at rest or 
any exercise intensity. Therefore the alpha activity response previously shown 
post-exercise was not found during exercise. However, increased PFC gamma 
activity in the MI group adds to the body of evidence showing increased gamma 
can differentiate between those with and without MI.
