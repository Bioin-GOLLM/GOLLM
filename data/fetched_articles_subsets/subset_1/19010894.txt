Small molecule inhibitors of HER2 are clinically active in women with advanced 
HER2-positive breast cancer who have progressed on trastuzumab treatment. 
However, the effectiveness of this class of agents is limited by either primary 
resistance or acquired resistance. Using an unbiased genetic approach, we 
performed a genome wide loss-of-function short hairpin RNA screen to identify 
novel modulators of resistance to lapatinib, a recently approved anti-HER2 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Here, we have identified the tumor suppressor PTEN as 
a modulator of lapatinib sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show 
that two dominant activating mutations in PIK3CA (E545K and H1047R), which are 
prevalent in breast cancer, also confer resistance to lapatinib. Furthermore, we 
show that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-induced lapatinib resistance can 
be abrogated through the use of NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of PI3K/mTOR. Our 
data show that deregulation of the PI3K pathway, either through loss-of-function 
mutations in PTEN or dominant activating mutations in PIK3CA, leads to lapatinib 
resistance, which can be effectively reversed by NVP-BEZ235.
