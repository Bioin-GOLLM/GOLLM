Aldehyde oxidase (AOX) plays an important role in drug metabolism. Human AOX 
(hAOX) is widely distributed in the body, and there are some differences between 
species. Currently, animal models cannot accurately predict the metabolism of 
hAOX. Therefore, more and more in silico models have been constructed for the 
prediction of the hAOX metabolism. These models are based on molecular docking 
and quantum chemistry theory, which are time-consuming and difficult to 
automate. Therefore, in this study, we compared traditional machine learning 
methods, graph convolutional neural network methods, and sequence-based methods 
with limited data, and proposed a ligand-based model for the metabolism 
prediction catalyzed by hAOX. Compared with the published models, our model 
achieved better performance (ACC = 0.91, F1 = 0.77). What's more, we built a web 
server to predict the sites of metabolism (SOMs) for hAOX. In summary, this 
study provides a convenient and automatable model and builds a web server named 
Meta-hAOX for accelerating the drug design and optimization stage.
