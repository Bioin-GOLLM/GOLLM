Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) mutations have been detected in gliomas, 
cartilaginous tumors, and leukemias. IDH1/2 mutations are early and frequent 
genetic alterations, are specific to a single codon in the conserved and 
functionally important Arginine 132 (R132) in IDH1 and Arginine 172 (R172) in 
IDH2. We previously established several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are 
specific for IDH1 mutations: clones IMab-1 or HMab-1 against IDH1-R132H or clone 
SMab-1 against IDH1-R132S. However, specific mAbs against IDH2 mutations have 
not been reported. To establish IDH2-mutation-specific mAbs, we immunized mice 
or rats with each mutation-containing IDH2 peptides including IDH2-R172K and 
IDH2-R172M. After cell fusion, IDH2 mutation-specific mAbs were screened in 
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Established mAbs KMab-1 and MMab-1 
reacted with the IDH2-R172K and IDH2-R172M peptides, respectively, but not with 
IDH2-wild type (WT) in ELISA. Western-blot analysis also showed that KMab-1 and 
MMab-1 reacted with the IDH2-R172K and IDH2-R172M recombinant proteins, 
respectively, not with IDH2-WT or other IDH2 mutants, indicating that KMab-1 and 
MMab-1 are IDH2-mutation-specific. Furthermore, MMab-1 specifically stained the 
IDH2-R172M-expressing cells in immunocytochemistry, but did not stain IDH2-WT 
and other IDH2-mutation-containing cells. In immunohistochemical analysis, 
MMab-1 specifically stained IDH2-R172M-expressing glioma. This is the first 
report to establish anti-IDH2-mutation-specific mAbs, which could be useful in 
diagnosis of mutation-bearing tumors.
