We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of variants of five 
lipolysis-related genes in Korean patients with very high triglycerides (TGs). 
Twenty-six patients with TG levels >885 mg/dL were selected from 13545 Korean 
subjects. Five candidate genes, LPL, APOC2, GPIHBP1, APOA5, and LMF1, were 
sequenced by targeted next-generation sequencing. Predictions of functional 
effects were performed and matched against public databases of variants. Ten 
rare variants of three genes were found in nine (34.6%) patients (three in LPL, 
four in APOA5, and three in LMF1). Five were novel and all variants were 
suspected of being disease-causing. Nine were heterozygous, and one (3.8%) had a 
homozygous rare variant of LPL. Six common variants of four genes were observed 
in 25 (96.2%) patients (one in LPL, one in GPIHBP1, two in APOA5, and two in 
LMF1). The c.G41T variant of GPIHBP1 and c.G533T variant of APOA5 were most 
frequent and found in 15 (57.7%) and 14 (53.8%) patients, respectively. Rare 
homozygous variants of the genes were very uncommon, while diverse rare 
heterozygous variants were commonly identified. Taken together, most study 
subjects may be manifesting the combined effects of rare heterozygous variants 
and common variants.
