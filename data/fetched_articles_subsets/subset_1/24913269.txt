Chordomas are uncommon neoplasms arising from notochord remnants, most commonly 
occurring in the axial skeleton. Extraskeletal soft tissue chordomas are rare 
primary tumors, and primary alimentary tract chordomas have not been reported. 
Herein we report 24 cases of spontaneous primary intestinal chordomas in 
zebrafish, as well as 9 spontaneous vertebral chordomas. Both intestinal and 
vertebral tumors showed invasive behavior, although more commonly in the latter. 
In all cases of primary intestinal chordomas, there was no axial or peripheral 
skeletal or other nonvisceral involvement. Although uncommon, intestinal 
chordomas represent a unique background lesion in aged zebrafish.
