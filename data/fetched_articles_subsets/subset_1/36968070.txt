Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest types of cancer 
and has a 5-year survival of less than 8% owing to its complex biology. As PDAC 
is refractory to immunotherapy, we need to understand the functional dynamics of 
T cells in the PDAC microenvironment to develop alternative therapeutic 
strategies. In this study, we performed RNA velocity-based pseudotime analysis 
on a scRNA-seq dataset from surgically resected human PDAC specimens to gain 
insight into temporal gene expression patterns that best characterize the cell 
fates. The tumor microenvironment was seen to encompass a range of terminal 
states for the T cell trajectories with suppressive and non-tumor-responsive 
T cells dominating them. However, the results also reveal the existence of a 
functional branch of the T cell population that was not transitioning to 
exhausted and senescent states. These findings reveal various microenvironmental 
signals driving T cell patterns which can be useful in identifying new 
therapeutic avenues.
