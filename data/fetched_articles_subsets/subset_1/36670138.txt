Accumulating evidence suggests that glutathione loss is closely associated with 
the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we found that the neuronal 
conditional-knockout (KO) of glutamyl-cysteine-ligase catalytic-subunit (GCLC), 
a rate-limiting enzyme for glutathione synthesis, induced brain atrophy 
accompanied by neuronal loss and neuroinflammation. GCLC-KO mice showed 
activation of C1q, which triggers engulfment of neurons by microglia, and 
disease-associated-microglia (DAM), suggesting that activation of microglia is 
linked to the neuronal loss. Furthermore, gasdermins, which regulate 
inflammatory form of cell death, were upregulated in the brains of GCLC-KO mice, 
suggesting the contribution of pyroptosis to neuronal cell death in these 
animals. In particular, GSDME-deficiency significantly attenuated the 
hippocampal atrophy and changed levels of DAM markers in GCLC-KO mice. Finally, 
we found that the expression of GCLC was decreased around amyloid plaques in 
AppNL-G-F AD model mice. AppNL-G-F mouse also exhibited inflammatory events 
similar to GCLC-KO mouse. We propose a mechanism by which a vicious cycle of 
oxidative stress and neuroinflammation enhances neurodegenerative processes. 
Furthermore, GCLC-KO mouse will serve as a useful tool to investigate the 
molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and in the development of new 
treatment strategies to address neurodegenerative diseases.
