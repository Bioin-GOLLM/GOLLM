Little is known about the evolution of repeated sequences over long periods of 
time. Using two independent approaches, we show that the majority of the repeats 
found in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome are ancient and likely to derive from 
the retention of fragments deposited during ancestral bursts that occurred early 
in the Brassicaceae evolution. We determine that the majority of young repeats 
are found in pericentromeric domains, while older copies are frequent in the 
gene-rich regions. Our results further suggest that the DNA methylation of 
repeats through small RNA-mediated pathways can last over prolonged periods of 
time. We also illustrate the way repeated sequences are composted by mutations 
towards genomic dark matter over time, probably driven by the deamination of 
methylcytosines, which also have an impact on epigenomic landscapes. Overall, we 
show that the ancient proliferation of repeat families has long-term 
consequences on A. thaliana biology and genome composition.
