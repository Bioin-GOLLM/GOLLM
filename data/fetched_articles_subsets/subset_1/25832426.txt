AIM: Atazanavir (ATV) is a HIV-1 protease inhibitor for the treatment of AIDS 
patients, which is recently reported to provoke excessive prolongation of the QT 
interval and torsades de pointes (TdP). In order to elucidate its arrhythmogenic 
mechanisms, we investigated the effects of ATV on the hERG K(+) channels 
expressed in HEK293 cells.
METHODS: hERG K(+) currents were detected using whole-cell patch clamp recording 
in HEK293 cells transfected with EGFP-hERG plasmids. The expression of hERG 
protein was measured with Western blotting. Two mutants (Y652A and F656C) were 
constructed in the S6 domain within the inner helices of hERG K(+) channels that 
were responsible for binding of various drugs. The trafficking of hERG protein 
was studied with confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: Application of ATV (0.01-30 μmol/L) concentration-dependently decreased 
hERG K(+) currents with an IC50 of 5.7±1.8 μmol/L. ATV (10 μmol/L) did not 
affect the activation and steady-state inactivation of hERG K(+) currents. 
Compared with the wild type hERG K(+) channels, both Y652A and F656C mutants 
significantly reduced the inhibition of ATV on hERG K(+) currents. Overnight 
treatment with ATV (0.1-30 μmol/L) concentration-dependently reduced the amount 
of fully glycosylated 155 kDa hERG protein without significantly affecting the 
core-glycosylated 135 kDa hERG protein in the cells expressing the WT-hERG 
protein. Confocal microscopy studies confirmed that overnight treatment with ATV 
obstructed the trafficking of hERG protein to the cell membrane.
CONCLUSION: ATV directly blocks hERG K(+) channels via binding to the residues 
Y652 and F656 in the S6 domain, and indirectly obstructs the transport of the 
hERG protein to the cell membrane.
