Chick embryo egg hydrolysates (CEEH) were obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of 
chick embryo egg in vitro-simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The antioxidant 
activities of CEEH were investigated by employing three in vitro assays, 
including the 
2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate)/1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl 
(ABTS/DPPH)/hydroxyl radical-scavenging assays. The radical-scavenging effect of 
CEEH (1.0 mg/mL) was in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest trolox 
equivalent antioxidant capacity for ABTS, DPPH, and that of hydroxyl radicals 
found to be 569, 2097, and 259.6 μmol/L, respectively; whereas the trolox 
equivalent antioxidant capacity of unhatched egg for ABTS, DPPH, and that of 
hydroxyl radicals were found to be 199, 993, and 226.5 μmol/L, respectively. 
CEEH showed stronger scavenging activity than the hydrolysates of unhatched egg 
against free radicals such as ABTS, DPPH, and hydroxyl radicals. The antioxidant 
amino acid analysis indicated that the 14-day CEEH possess more antioxidant 
amino acids than that of the unhatched egg. In addition, essential amino acids 
analysis showed that the 14-day CEEH have the highest nutritional value. 
Combined with the results of the amino acid profiles, CEEH were believed to have 
higher nutritive value in addition to antioxidant activities than the unhatched 
egg.
