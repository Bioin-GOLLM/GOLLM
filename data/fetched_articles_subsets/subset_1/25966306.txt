The mammalian cranial vault largely consists of five flat bones that are joined 
together along their edges by soft fibrous tissues called sutures. Premature 
closure of the cranial sutures, craniosynostosis, can lead to serious clinical 
pathology unless there is surgical intervention. Research into the genetic basis 
of the disease has led to the development of various animal models that display 
this condition, e.g. mutant type Fgfr2C342Y/+ mice which display early fusion of 
the coronal suture (joining the parietal and frontal bones). However, whether 
the biomechanical properties of the mutant and wild type bones are affected has 
not been investigated before. Therefore, nanoindentation was used to compare the 
elastic modulus of cranial bone and sutures in wild type (WT) and 
Fgfr2C342Y/+mutant type (MT) mice during their postnatal development. Further, 
the variations in properties with indentation position and plane were assessed. 
No difference was observed in the elastic modulus of parietal bone between the 
WT and MT mice at postnatal (P) day 10 and 20. However, the modulus of frontal 
bone in the MT group was lower than the WT group at both P10 (1.39±0.30 vs. 
5.32±0.68 GPa; p<0.05) and P20 (5.57±0.33 vs. 7.14±0.79 GPa; p<0.05). A wide 
range of values was measured along the coronal sutures for both the WT and MT 
samples, with no significant difference between the two groups. Findings of this 
study suggest that the inherent mechanical properties of the frontal bone in the 
mutant mice were different to the wild type mice from the same genetic 
background. These differences may reflect variations in the degree of 
biomechanical adaptation during skull growth, which could have implications for 
the surgical management of craniosynostosis patients.
