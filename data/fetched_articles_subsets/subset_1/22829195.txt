Selective targeting of the mTORC1/2 protein kinase complexes leads to 
antileukemic effects in vitro and in vivo.

The BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase promotes leukemogenesis through activation of 
several targets that include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which target BCR/ABL, induce striking clinical 
responses. However, therapy with TKIs is associated with limitations such as 
drug intolerance, inability to universally eradicate the disease and emergence 
of BCR/ABL drug-resistant mutants. To overcome these limitations, we tested 
whether inhibition of the PI3K/target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has 
antileukemic effect in primary hematopoietic stem cells and BA/F3 cells 
expressing the BCR/ABL oncoprotein. We determined that dual inhibition of 
PI3K/mTOR causes growth arrest and apoptosis leading to profound antileukemic 
effects both in vitro and in vivo. We also established that pharmacologic 
inhibition of the mTORC1/mTORC2 complexes is sufficient to cause these 
antileukemic effects. Our results support the development of inhibitors of the 
mTORC1/2 complexes for the therapy of leukemias that either express BCR/ABL or 
display deregulation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.
