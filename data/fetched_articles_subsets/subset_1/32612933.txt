Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been shown to stabilize certain aspects of 
Fabry disease (FD). However, in some patients on ERT, high antibody titres have 
been documented, with limited clinical improvement in systemic manifestations 
and often with significant adverse drug reactions. We present two related 
adolescent males with a 4.5 kb GLA deletion, not amenable to chaperone therapy, 
leading to profound reduction in α-galactosidase A (α-gal A) enzyme activity. 
Over a 3-year period of ERT, increasing IgG antibody titres against α-gal A were 
noted. After starting ERT serial urine globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) measurements 
showed an upward trend from 333 to 2260 μg/mmol creatinine for patient 1 and 
1165 to 2260 μg/mmol creatinine for patient 2. Markedly increased levels of 
urine and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) analogues were also found. 
The patients experienced recurrent infusion-associated reactions necessitating 
premedication and prolonged infusion times. Over the 3-year period of ERT, the 
patients experienced continued malaise, gastrointestinal symptoms and 
neuropathic pain. In addition, they had increasing anxiety related to their 
disease and apparent lack of response to ERT which led to a decision to 
ultimately stop ERT. No other approved treatment options are currently available 
for these patients. It is possible that the rapid development of the high 
antidrug neutralizing antibody (ADA) titres is related to the large GLA deletion 
leading to virtually absent enzyme activity. It remains unclear if their 
symptomatology during the period of receiving ERT is related to lack of its 
efficacy, the rising ADA titres, or both. These two patients highlight the need 
for further research into the management of antidrug antibodies and additional 
therapeutic approaches for FD.
SYNOPSIS: The development of very high antidrug antibody titres in response to 
ERT in two related adolescent males with FD highlight the need for other 
therapeutic options for patients in whom ERT or other currently approved 
therapies does not meet their treatment needs.
