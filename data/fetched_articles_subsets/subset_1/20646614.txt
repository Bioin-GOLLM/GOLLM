OBJECTIVE: To study the drug resistance mechanism of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) cell line PC9/AB2 with acquired drug resistance to gefitinib.
METHODS: The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line PC9 was cultured in vitro, and 
was induced by MNNG to obtain the cell line PC9/AB2 with acquired drug 
resistance to gefitinib. The sensitivity of the cell line PC9 and PC9/AB2 to 
gefitinib was determined by MTT assay. The effects of gefitinib on cell 
apoptosis of the 2 cell lines were determined by flow cytometry. The genomic DNA 
of the 2 cell lines were extracted, and then the exons 19-21 of EGFR gene were 
amplified by PCR and sequenced. The protein expression of c-MET and integrin 
beta1 in the 2 cell lines was determined by Western blot method. The adhesion 
ability and migration ability of the 2 cell lines were determined by adhesion 
test and scratch assay.
RESULTS: (1) The data form MTT and apoptosis detection showed that the IC50 of 
PC9/AB2 cells was (24.2+/-5.5) micromol/L, 576 times higher than PC9 cells [IC50 
(0.04+/-0.01) micromol/L]. Given the same concentration of gefitinib, the 
apoptosis rate of PC9 cells was 38.48%, while that of PC9/AB2 cells was 2.2%. 
(2) The results of gene sequencing showed that there was a deletion of 15 bp in 
both exon 19 of the 2 cell lines, while no T790M mutation occurred. (3) The 
results from Western blot showed that there was no significant difference in 
protein expression of c-MET between the 2 cell lines, while the protein 
expression of integrin beta1 in PC9/AB2 cells was significantly higher than that 
of the PC9 cells. (4) The result from adhesion test and scratch assay showed 
that the adhesion ability and migration ability of the PC9/AB2 cells was 
significantly higher that those of PC9 cells.
CONCLUSION: The high expression of integrin beta1 may be associated with 
acquired drug resistance of NSCLC cell line PC9/AB2 to gefitinib.
