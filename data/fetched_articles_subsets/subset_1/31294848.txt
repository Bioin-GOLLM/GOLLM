An eight-week old Doberman Pinscher was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos syndrome 
based on the dog's hyper-mobile carpal, tarsal and stifle joints and abnormal 
skin. The skin was loose and hyper-elastic with several wounds and large 
atrophic scars. The dog was euthanized after a severe degloving injury from 
minimal trauma. A whole-genome sequence, generated with DNA from the dog's 
blood, contained a rare, homozygous C-to-T transition at position 2408978 on 
chromosome 11. This transition is predicted to alter the ADAMTS2 transcript 
(ADAMTS2:c.769C>T) and encode a nonsense mutation (p.Arg257Ter). Biallelic 
ADAMTS2 mutations have caused a type of Ehlers Danlos syndrome known as 
dermatosparaxis in other species.
