The identification of the mutations that drive lung cancer have furnished new 
targets for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and led to the 
development of targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are 
used to combat the molecular changes promoting cancer progression. Furthermore, 
biomarkers identified from gene analysis can be used to detect early lung 
cancer, determine patient prognosis, and monitor response to therapy. In the 
present study we analyzed the molecular profile of seventy-three Tunisian 
patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). Mutational analyses for EGFR and KRAS 
were performed using direct sequencing, immunohistochemistry or MassARRAY. 
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement was evaluated by 
immunohistochemistry using the D5F3 clone, and p53 expression was also assessed. 
The median age of patients at diagnosis was 61 years (range 23-82 years). Using 
different methodologies, EGFR mutations were found in 5.47% of patients and only 
exon 19 deletions "E746-A750 del" were detected. KRAS mutations were present in 
9.58% of cases, while only one patient was ALK-positive. Moreover, abnormal 
immunostaining of p53 was detected in 56.16% of patients. In conclusion, the 
detected rates of EGFR and KRAS mutation and ALK rearrangement were lower than 
those found in European and Asian countries, whereas, abnormal p53 expression 
was slightly more frequent. Furthermore, given the small sample size of this 
study, a more comprehensive analysis of this patient set is warranted.
