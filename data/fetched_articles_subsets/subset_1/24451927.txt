A genetic method for sex determination in raccoons was developed based on 
nucleotide differences of the zinc finger protein genes ZFX and ZFY. Four novel 
internal primers specific for ZFX or ZFY were designed. PCR amplification using 
two primer sets followed by agarose gel electrophoresis enabled sex 
determination. 141-bp and 447-bp bands were in both sex, and 346-bp band was 
specific only in male with primer set I. 345-bp and 447-bp bands were in both 
sex, and 141-bp band was specific only in male with primer set II, which could 
distinguish raccoon's electrophoresis pattern from three native carnivores in 
Hokkaido. This method will be useful for conservation genetics studies or 
biological analyses of raccoons.
