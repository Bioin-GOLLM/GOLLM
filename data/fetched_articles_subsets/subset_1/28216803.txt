Selective recognition of anions has received a tremendous attention in recent 
years because of their significant importance in biology and environment. This 
article highlights our recent research on a thiophene-based azacryptand that has 
been shown to effectively bind anions including iodide, bromide, chloride, 
nitrate and sulfate. Structural studies indicate that the ligand forms inclusion 
complexes with chloride and iodide. On the other hand, it forms cleft-like 
complexes with nitrate and sulfate, where three anions are bound between the 
cyclic arms. The ligand binds each anion with a 1:1 binding mode in water, 
exhibiting strong selectivity for sulfate; which is further supported by ESI-MS 
and DFT calculations.
