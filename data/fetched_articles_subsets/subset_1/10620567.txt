BACKGROUND: The cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 enzyme debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase 
metabolizes many different classes of commonly used drugs, such as tricyclic 
antidepressants and neuroleptics. Genetic polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene is 
responsible for pronounced interindividual and interracial differences in the 
metabolism of these drugs. The CYP2D6*10 allele and its variants are the most 
frequent alleles found in Orientals, and they are responsible for diminished 
debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase activity because of the presence of a C(188)-->T 
mutation in exon 1.
METHODS: One hundred nineteen Hong Kong Chinese subjects were genotyped by means 
of allele-specific PCR, PCR, and restriction enzyme analysis for 10 CYP2D6 
alleles (CYP2D6*1, *2, *4D, *5, *8/*14, *10A, *10B, *15, *16, and J9).
RESULTS: CYP2D6*10B was the most prevalent allele, and CYP2D6*10/CYP2D6*10 was 
the most frequent genotype, representing 41.17% [corrected] of the population.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in the prevalence of the 
alleles analyzed between our study and the Chinese populations genotyped 
previously. This is the largest study in terms of the number of CYP2D6 alleles 
analyzed in an Oriental population and the first one conducted in a Hong Kong 
Chinese population.
