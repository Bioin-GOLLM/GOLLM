GNB1L haploinsufficiency caused by 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may contribute to 
schizophrenia pathophysiology. We resequenced the protein-coding sequences of 
GNB1L in 553 patients with schizophrenia and 535 controls from Taiwan. Four 
common single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed no association with patients with 
schizophrenia. We identified 17 rare missense mutations, including three that 
were schizophrenia-associated and predicted as pathogenic (p.R57W, p.G68S, and 
p.R265C). Given that rare mutations with high penetrance contribute to 
schizophrenia, missense mutations of GNB1L might increase the risk of 
schizophrenia in some patients.
