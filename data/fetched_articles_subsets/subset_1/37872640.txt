BACKGROUND: As the availability of genomic testing grows, variant interpretation 
will increasingly be performed by genomic generalists, rather than 
domain-specific experts. Demand is rising for laboratories to accurately 
classify variants in inherited cardiac condition (ICC) genes, including 
secondary findings.
METHODS: We analyse evidence for inheritance patterns, allelic requirement, 
disease mechanism and disease-relevant variant classes for 65 ClinGen-curated 
ICC gene-disease pairs. We present this information for the first time in a 
structured dataset, CardiacG2P, and assess application in genomic variant 
filtering.
RESULTS: For 36/65 gene-disease pairs, loss of function is not an established 
disease mechanism, and protein truncating variants are not known to be 
pathogenic. Using the CardiacG2P dataset as an initial variant filter allows for 
efficient variant prioritisation whilst maintaining a high sensitivity for 
retaining pathogenic variants compared with two other variant filtering 
approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Access to evidence-based structured data representing disease 
mechanism and allelic requirement aids variant filtering and analysis and is a 
pre-requisite for scalable genomic testing.
