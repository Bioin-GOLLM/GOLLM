Keratinocyte growth factor-2 (KGF-2) plays an important role in vertebrate limb 
development, lung branching morphogenesis, regeneration and reconstruction of 
the epidermis. Previous studies have used the wild type factor. Here, we have 
constructed a double-site mutant of human KGF-2, named STEA. STEA possesses 
higher receptor binding affinity and promotes better proliferation activity on 
rat tracheal epithelium (RTE) cells than recombinant human KGF-2. These results 
suggest that the simultaneous mutation of Ser115 to Thr and Glu117 to Ala 
improves the biological activity of KGF-2.
