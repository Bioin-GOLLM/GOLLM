Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy associated 
with <5% 5-year survival, in which standard chemotherapeutics have limited 
benefit. The disease is associated with significant intra- and peritumoral 
inflammation and failure of protective immunosurveillance. Indeed, inflammatory 
signals are implicated in both tumour initiation and tumour progression. The 
major pathways regulating PDAC-associated inflammation are now being explored. 
Activation of leukocytes, and upregulation of cytokine and chemokine signalling 
pathways, both have been shown to modulate PDAC progression. Therefore, 
targeting inflammatory pathways may be of benefit as part of a multi-target 
approach to PDAC therapy. This review explores the pathways known to modulate 
inflammation at different stages of tumour development, drawing conclusions on 
their potential as therapeutic targets in PDAC.
