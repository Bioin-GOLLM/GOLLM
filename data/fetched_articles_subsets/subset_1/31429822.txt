As an optically transparent model organism with an endothelial blood-brain 
barrier (BBB), zebrafish offer a powerful tool to study the vertebrate BBB. 
However, the precise developmental profile of functional zebrafish BBB 
acquisition and the subcellular and molecular mechanisms governing the zebrafish 
BBB remain poorly characterized. Here, we capture the dynamics of developmental 
BBB leakage using live imaging, revealing a combination of steady accumulation 
in the parenchyma and sporadic bursts of tracer leakage. Electron microscopy 
studies further reveal high levels of transcytosis in brain endothelium early in 
development that are suppressed later. The timing of this suppression of 
transcytosis coincides with the establishment of BBB function. Finally, we 
demonstrate a key mammalian BBB regulator Mfsd2a, which inhibits transcytosis, 
plays a conserved role in zebrafish, as mfsd2aa mutants display increased BBB 
permeability due to increased transcytosis. Our findings indicate a conserved 
developmental program of barrier acquisition between zebrafish and mice.
