CONTEXT: Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas are refractory to common 
anticancer therapies, and novel inhibitors are being tested in these deadly 
malignancies. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase 
represents an attractive target for treatment because it is up-regulated in 
thyroid cancer and plays a role in cancer progression. However, EGFR inhibitors 
have provided poor results in thyroid carcinomas.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the possible mechanism underlying the resistance of 
thyroid cancer cells to EGFR inhibitors.
DESIGN: We tested the effect of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in 
a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines.
RESULTS: We found that in most of the cell lines, although gefitinib inhibited 
EGFR phosphorylation, it was poorly effective in reducing cell viability. 
gefitinib, however, was able to inhibit epidermal growth factor-induced cell 
migration and matrix invasion. In most thyroid cancer cell lines, gefitinib 
significantly inhibited Akt phosphorylation by inhibiting EGFR activation, but 
it had limited or no effect on ERK phosphorylation. The poor cell response to 
gefitinib was associated with genetic alterations, leading to constitutive 
activation of the ERK pathway, including BRAF(V600E) and HRAS(G12A/Q61R) 
mutations and RET/PTC1 rearrangement. When BRAF(V600E)-positive thyroid cancer 
cells were incubated with the specific BRAF inhibitor PLX4032, sensitivity to 
gefitinib was restored. Similar results were obtained with rat sarcoma and 
RET/papillary thyroid cancer inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that thyroid cancer resistance to gefitinib 
is due to the constitutive activation of the mitogenic pathway by either signals 
downstream of EGFR or other tyrosine kinase receptors. This resistance can be 
overcome by the combined use of selective inhibitors.
