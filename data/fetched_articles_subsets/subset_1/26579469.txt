Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has been recognized as an important cancer 
drug target. Many recent studies have provided convincing evidences of strong 
correlation between elevated levels of HIF-1 and tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, 
poor patient prognosis as well as tumor resistance therapy. It was found that 
hypoxia (low O2 levels) is a common character in many types of solid tumors. As 
an adaptive response to hypoxic stress, hypoxic tumor cells activate several 
survival pathways to carry out their essential biological processes in different 
ways compared with normal cells. Recent advances in cancer biology at the 
cellular and molecular levels highlighted the HIF-1α pathway as a crucial 
survival pathway for which novel strategies of cancer therapy could be 
developed. However, targeting the HIF-1α pathway has been a challenging but 
promising progresses have been made in the past twenty years. This review 
summarizes the role and regulation of the HIF-1α in cancer, and recent 
therapeutic approaches targeting this important pathway.
