Stickler syndrome is a heterogeneous condition due to mutations in COL2A1, 
COL11A1, COL11A2, and COL9A1. To our knowledge, neither non-penetrance nor 
mosaicism for COL2A1 mutations has been reported for Stickler syndrome. We 
report on a family with two clinically affected sibs with Stickler syndrome who 
have clinically unaffected parents. Both sibs have a novel heterozygous mutation 
in exon 26 of COL2A1 (c.1525delT); this results in a premature termination codon 
downstream of the mutation site. One parent was found to have low level 
mosaicism in DNA extracted from whole blood. This scenario encourages 
consideration of molecular testing in seemingly unaffected parents for 
recurrence risks and potential screening for mild age-related manifestations.
