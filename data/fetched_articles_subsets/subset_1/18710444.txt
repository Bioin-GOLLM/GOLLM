OBJECTIVE: To determine if the C421A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 
ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 increases prostate cancer risk or affects 
survival.
PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Numerous studies have suggested that dietary, 
hormonal and environmental factors all play a role in the initiation in prostate 
cancer; among these, the carcinogenic heterocyclic amine 
2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), a known substrate of the 
ABCG2. A SNP of ABCG2, C421A, resulting in a glutamine to lysine change at amino 
acid 141, has been shown to result in decreased function of the protein. Due to 
the expression of ABCG2 in the prostate, together with the purported role of 
dietary carcinogens and steroids in the development and progression of prostate 
cancer, 311 individuals were genotyped for the ABCG2 C421A SNP, 170 patients 
with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) and 141 'healthy' controls. We 
also evaluated the effect of this SNP on the intracellular accumulation of PhIP 
and testosterone in vitro.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the prevalence of prostate 
cancer based on ABCG2 genetic variation in this population. However, survival 
was significantly longer for individuals with wild-type ABCG2, as compared with 
those hetero- or homozygous for the C421A SNP (7.4 years vs 5.3 years, P = 
0.044). Intracellular accumulation of PhIP was 80% higher in HEK293 cells 
transfected with Q141K ABCG2 than in wild-type cells, confirming that this SNP 
decreases transport of PhIP. In contrast, testosterone was not transported by 
either wild-type or variant transfected cells, nor did it act as in inhibitor of 
ABCG2 in subsequent transport assays.
CONCLUSION: Increased exposure to PhIP may decrease survival, but the ABCG2 
C421A polymorphism does not appear to increase the risk of prostate cancer.
