BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing is a common disorder associated with 
significant morbidity. The genetic architecture of sleep-disordered breathing 
remains poorly understood. Through the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine 
(TOPMed) program, we performed the first whole-genome sequence analysis of 
sleep-disordered breathing.
METHODS: The study sample was comprised of 7988 individuals of diverse ancestry. 
Common-variant and pathway analyses included an additional 13,257 individuals. 
We examined five complementary traits describing different aspects of 
sleep-disordered breathing: the apnea-hypopnea index, average oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation per event, average and minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation across the 
sleep episode, and the percentage of sleep with oxyhemoglobin saturation < 90%. 
We adjusted for age, sex, BMI, study, and family structure using MMSKAT and 
EMMAX mixed linear model approaches. Additional bioinformatics analyses were 
performed with MetaXcan, GIGSEA, and ReMap.
RESULTS: We identified a multi-ethnic set-based rare-variant association (p = 
3.48 × 10-8) on chromosome X with ARMCX3. Additional rare-variant associations 
include ARMCX3-AS1, MRPS33, and C16orf90. Novel common-variant loci were 
identified in the NRG1 and SLC45A2 regions, and previously associated loci in 
the IL18RAP and ATP2B4 regions were associated with novel phenotypes. 
Transcription factor binding site enrichment identified associations with genes 
implicated with respiratory and craniofacial traits. Additional analyses 
identified significantly associated pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the first gene-based rare-variant associations 
with objectively measured sleep-disordered breathing traits. Our results 
increase the understanding of the genetic architecture of sleep-disordered 
breathing and highlight associations in genes that modulate lung development, 
inflammation, respiratory rhythmogenesis, and HIF1A-mediated hypoxic response.
