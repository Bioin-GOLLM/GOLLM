BACKGROUND: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a salivary gland malignancy with 
poor long-term survival, which warrants studies aimed at clarifying the 
pathogenesis of this disease in order to widen the scope of therapeutic options 
currently available. Alterations in regulatory mechanisms relating to vascular 
support, cell death and autophagy are important pathways for tumor growth in 
cancer. Thus, the present study aimed to access vascular supply, apoptosis, 
autophagy and cell senescence in ACC of minor salivary glands.
METHODS: We analyzed 25 cases of minor salivary gland ACC by 
immunohistochemistry using anti-CD34, anti-CD105, anti-D2-40, anti-Bax, 
anti-Bcl-2, anti-Beclin-1, anti-LC3B, anti-p21 and anti-p16.
RESULTS: Microvessel density was low and based on anti-CD34, anti-CD105 and 
anti-D2-40 immunostaining. There was positivity for anti-CD34, anti-Bcl-2, 
anti-Beclin, anti-LC3B and anti-p21 and a positive correlation between Bcl-2 and 
Beclin (p = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that ACC does not depend on neo-angiogenesis and 
is probably associated to anti-apoptotic, autophagic and anti-senescence events.
