A novel method for the synthesis of bile acid derivatives has been developed 
using "click chemistry". Intermolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the 
propargyl ester of bile acids and azide groups of 1,3,5-tris(azidomethyl)benzene 
gave a new quasi-podands with 1,2,3-triazole rings. The structures of the 
products were confirmed by spectral (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and FT-IR) analysis, mass 
spectrometry and PM5 semiempirical methods. Estimation of the 
pharmacotherapeutic potential has been accomplished for synthesized compounds on 
the basis of Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS).
