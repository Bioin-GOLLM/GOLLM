Backtracking, the reverse motion of the transcriptase enzyme on the nucleic acid 
template, is a universal regulatory feature of transcription in cellular 
organisms but its role in viruses is not established. Here we present evidence 
that backtracking extends into the viral realm, where backtracking by the 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) may aid viral transcription and 
replication. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase 
and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron 
microscopy, RNA-protein crosslinking, and unbiased molecular dynamics 
simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish 
that the single-stranded 3'-segment of the product-RNA generated by backtracking 
extrudes through the RdRp NTP-entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the 
product-RNA 3'-end frays and enters the NTP-entry tunnel to initiate 
backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking. Backtracking may aid 
proofreading, a crucial process for SARS-CoV-2 resistance against antivirals.
