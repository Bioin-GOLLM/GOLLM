Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is one of the most common thyroid malignancy 
with various histologic variants. Acknowledging the correct histological variant 
of PTC helps to know about the tumor's nature and prognosis. The Warthin-like 
variant of papillary thyroid (WLPTC), a newly described histologic variant of 
PTC, is relatively uncommon. A 16-year-old female presented with complaints of 
painful thyroid swelling for two years. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) 
from the lobes showed lymphocytic thyroiditis features with Hurthle cell change. 
Sections from the left lobe revealed a diagnosis of a Warthin‑like variant of 
PTC without nodal metastasis. WLPTC is a rare variant having a favorable outcome 
due to the absence of lymph node metastasis, extra-thyroidal extension, and a 
low recurrence rate. The correct cytological and histomorphological features are 
of utmost importance to render the diagnosis of WLPTC for better management.
