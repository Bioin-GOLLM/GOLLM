Infection of wMel Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti imparts two signature features that 
enable its application for biocontrol of dengue. First, the susceptibility of 
mosquitoes to viruses such as dengue and Zika is reduced. Second, a reproductive 
manipulation is caused that enables wMel introgression into wild-type mosquito 
populations. The long-term success of this method relies, in part, on evolution 
of the wMel genome not compromising the critical features that make it an 
attractive biocontrol tool. This study compared the wMel Wolbachia genome at the 
time of initial releases and 1-7 years post-release in Cairns, Australia. Our 
results show the wMel genome remains highly conserved up to 7 years post-release 
in gene sequence, content, synteny and structure. This work suggests the wMel 
genome is stable in its new mosquito host and, therefore, provides reassurance 
on the potential for wMel to deliver long-term public-health impacts.
