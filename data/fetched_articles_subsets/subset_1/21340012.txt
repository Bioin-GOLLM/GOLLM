Microsatellite loci were isolated from the genomic DNA of the Asian rice gall 
midge, Orseolia oryzae (Wood-Mason) using a hybridization capture approach. A 
total of 90 non-redundant primer pairs, representing unique loci, were designed. 
These simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers represented di (72%), tri (15.3%), 
and complex repeats (12.7%). Three biotypes of gall midge (20 individuals for 
each biotype) were screened using these SSRs. The results revealed that 15 loci 
were hyper variable and showed polymorphism among different biotypes of this 
pest. The number of alleles ranged from two to 11 and expected heterozygosity 
was above 0.5. Inheritance studies with three markers (observed to be 
polymorphic between sexes) revealed sex linked inheritance of two SSRs (Oosat55 
and Oosat59) and autosomal inheritance of one marker (Oosat43). These markers 
will prove to be a useful tool to devise strategies for integrated pest 
management and in the study of biotype evolution in this important rice pest.
