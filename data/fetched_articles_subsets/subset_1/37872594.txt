BACKGROUND: The incidence of malaria in Thailand has dramatically declined over 
the past two decades, and the goal is to eliminate malaria by 2025. Despite 
significant progress, one of the key challenges to malaria elimination are 
undetected gametocyte carriers. Human migration adds complexity to the malaria 
situation, as it not only sustains local transmission but also poses the risk of 
spreading drug-resistant parasites. Currently, no study has assessed the 
prevalence of gametocytes across multiple years in Plasmodium falciparum malaria 
patients in Thailand, and the risk factors for gametocyte carriage have not been 
fully explored.
METHODS: Medical records of all P. falciparum malaria patients admitted from 
January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2020 at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 
Thailand, were retrospectively examined and a total of 1962 records were 
included for analysis. Both P. falciparum parasites and gametocytes were 
diagnosed by microscopy. A regression model was used to evaluate predictors of 
gametocyte carriage.
RESULTS: The study demonstrated gametocyte prevalence in low malaria 
transmission areas. Nine risk factors for gametocyte carriage were identified: 
age between 15 and 24 years [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.96, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.18-3.26], Karen ethnicity (aOR = 2.59, 95% CI 1.56-4.29), 
preadmission duration of fever > 7 days (aOR = 5.40, 95% CI 3.92-7.41), fever on 
admission (> 37.5 °C) (aOR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.48-0.77), haemoglobin ≤ 8 g/dL 
(aOR = 3.32, 95% CI 2.06-5.33), asexual parasite density > 5000-25,000/µL 
(aOR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.98), asexual parasite density > 25,000-100,000/µL 
(aOR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.53-1.03), asexual parasite density > 100,000/µL 
(aOR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.36-0.72), platelet count ≤ 100,000/µL (aOR = 0.65, 95% CI 
0.50-0.85, clinical features of severe malaria (aOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.76-3.10) 
and dry season (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.10-1.80). An increasing incidence of 
imported transnational malaria cases was observed over the past two decades.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to determine the prevalence of gametocytes 
among patients with symptomatic P. falciparum malaria, identify the risk factors 
for gametocyte carriage, and potential gametocyte carriers in Thailand. Blocking 
transmission is one of the key strategies for eliminating malaria in these 
areas. The results might provide important information for targeting gametocyte 
carriers and improving the allocation of resources for malaria control in 
Thailand. This study supports the already nationally recommended use of a single 
dose of primaquine in symptomatic P. falciparum malaria patients to clear 
gametocytes.
