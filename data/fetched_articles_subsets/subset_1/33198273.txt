Soybean (Glycine max L.) is one of the most important crop plants in the 
Republic of Korea. Here, we conducted a soybean virome study. We harvested a 
total of 172 soybean leaf samples showing disease symptoms from major 
soybean-growing regions in the Republic of Korea. Individual samples were 
examined for virus infection by RT-PCR. Moreover, we generated eight libraries 
representing eight provinces by pooling samples and four libraries from single 
samples. RNA-seq followed by bioinformatics analyses revealed 10 different RNA 
viruses infecting soybean. The proportion of viral reads in each transcriptome 
ranged from 0.2 to 31.7%. Coinfection of different viruses in soybean plants was 
very common. There was a single dominant virus in each province, and this 
geographical difference might be related to the soybean seeds that transmit 
viruses. In this study, 32 viral genome sequences were assembled and 
successfully used to analyze the phylogenetic relationships and quasispecies 
nature of the identified RNA viruses. Moreover, RT-PCR with newly developed 
primers confirmed infection of the identified viruses in each library. Taken 
together, our soybean virome study provides a comprehensive overview of viruses 
infecting soybean in eight geographical regions in the Republic of Korea and 
four single soybean plants in detail.
