The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the primary cause of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome (AIDS), one of the deadliest pandemic diseases. Various 
mechanisms and procedures have been pursued to synthesise several anti-HIV 
agents, but due to the severe side effects and multidrug resistance spawning 
from the treatment of HIV/AIDS using highly active retroviral therapy (HAART), 
it has become imperative to design and synthesise novel anti-HIV agents. 
Literature has shown that natural sources, particularly the plant kingdom, can 
release important metabolites that have several biological, mechanistic and 
structural representations similar to chemically synthesised compounds. 
Certainly, compounds from natural and ethnomedicinal sources have proven to be 
effective in the management of HIV/AIDS with low toxicity, fewer side effects 
and affordability. From plants, fungi and bacteria, coumarin can be obtained, 
which is a secondary metabolite and is well known for its actions in different 
stages of the HIV replication cycle: protease, integrase and reverse 
transcriptase (RT) inhibition, cell membrane fusion and viral host attachment. 
These, among other reasons, are why coumarin moieties will be the basis of a 
good building block for the development of potent anti-HIV agents. This review 
aims to outline the synthetic pathways, structure-activity relationship (SAR) 
and POM analyses of coumarin hybrids with anti-HIV activity, detailing articles 
published between 2000 and 2023.
