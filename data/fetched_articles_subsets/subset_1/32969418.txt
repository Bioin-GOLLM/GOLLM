Herein, a novel and rationally designed ortho-substituted pyridine activator is 
reported that reacts rapidly and selectively with cysteine thiols. It forms 
reduction-stable conjugates and induces large pseudocontact shifts, residual 
dipolar couplings and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement on both ubiquitin S57C 
and human carbonic anhydrase II S50C constructs under physiological conditions.
