Color vision in birds is mediated by four types of cone photoreceptors whose 
maximal sensitivities (λmax) are evenly spaced across the light spectrum. In the 
course of avian evolution, the λmax of the most shortwave-sensitive cone, SWS1, 
has switched between violet (λmax > 400 nm) and ultraviolet (λmax < 380 nm) 
multiple times. This shift of the SWS1 opsin is accompanied by a corresponding 
short-wavelength shift in the spectrally adjacent SWS2 cone. Here, we show that 
SWS2 cone spectral tuning is mediated by modulating the ratio of two 
apocarotenoids, galloxanthin and 11’,12’-dihydrogalloxanthin, which act as 
intracellular spectral filters in this cell type. We propose an enzymatic 
pathway that mediates the differential production of these apocarotenoids in the 
avian retina, and we use color vision modeling to demonstrate how correlated 
evolution of spectral tuning is necessary to achieve even sampling of the light 
spectrum and thereby maintain near-optimal color discrimination.
