Rakkyo (Allium chinense), is a Japanese leek that is primarily used to make a 
popular sweet or sour pickled dish. Lactic acid bacteria are often involved in 
the preparation steps of fermented pickles, which helps in the effective 
preservation of the natural bioactive compounds of fruits and vegetable, and 
thereby exert several health benefits including immunomodulation and growth 
performance. This work aimed to evaluate the in vivo effects of adding 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum N14 fermented rakkyo pickled juice as feed 
supplement on the immunocompetence and production performance of pigs. We first 
analyzed the nutritional composition, which revealed that the proportion of 
protein, lipid, and water-soluble fiber content were estimated as of 4%, 5%, and 
5% in rakkyo residual liquid or juice, while 22%, 15% and 14%, respectively, 
were estimated in rakkyo residual powder. For the in vivo feeding trials, three 
groups of pigs were treated either with 5%, 20%, or 40% mixture (v/v) of 
fermented rakkyo pickled juice and the grinded residual liquid supplemented in 
the drinking water in addition to standard feed. The results of the feeding 
trials showed that the administration of a juice mixture of 5% or 20% (fermented 
pickled juice and residual liquid) had a similar trend of effects in improving 
the complement activity, phagocytic activity and leucocytes counts in the 
peripheral blood when compared to pigs fed with 40% mixture or untreated 
controls. Those changes were related to an improved resistance to enteric 
infections. Moreover, animals receiving a mixture of fermented pickled juice and 
fermented rakkyo residues had a higher growth rate and carcass quality than 
controls. The results suggested that the use of 5% mixture of fermented rakkyo 
pickled juice and the residual liquid through drinking water could be a 
cost-effective approach to promote the immune-health and production performance 
of pigs. This approach would contribute not only to the sustainable management 
of food wastes but also to the application of a value-added feed supplement for 
the promotion of animal health and production.
