The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of BRCA1 mutations in 
Chinese breast cancer patients in Singapore. BRCA1 analysis was conducted in 
consecutive patients with breast cancer before the age of 40 years (76 women), 
or whose relatives had breast or ovarian cancer (16 women). Ten patients had 
both early onset breast cancer and affected relatives. Genomic DNA from 
peripheral mononuclear blood cells was studied by using the protein 
transcription-translation assay (exon 11) and single-strand conformational 
polymorphism, with subsequent DNA sequencing. All six disease-causing mutations 
occurred in women under 40 years (8.6%) with three occurring in patients under 
35 years (three out of 22 patients, 13.6%). Mis-sense mutations of unknown 
significance were found in three patients. Two of the ten women with affected 
relatives under 40 years had BRCA1 mutations. The prevalence of BRCA1 mutations 
in Chinese patients with early onset breast cancer is similar to that observed 
in Caucasian women. Most Chinese patients with affected relatives were not 
carriers of BRCA1 mutations.
