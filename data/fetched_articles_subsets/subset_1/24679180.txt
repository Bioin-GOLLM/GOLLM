The field of behavioral economics has made important inroads into the 
understanding of substance use disorders through the concept of reinforcer 
pathology. Reinforcer pathology refers to the joint effects of (a) the 
persistently high valuation of a reinforcer, broadly defined to include tangible 
commodities and experiences, and/or (b) the excessive preference for the 
immediate acquisition or consumption of a commodity despite long-term negative 
outcomes. From this perspective, reinforcer pathology results from the recursive 
interactions of endogenous person-level variables and exogenous 
environment-level factors. The current review describes the basic principles of 
behavioral economics that are central to reinforcer pathology, the processes 
that engender reinforcer pathology, and the approaches and procedures that can 
repair reinforcement pathologies. The overall goal of this review is to present 
a new understanding of substance use disorders as viewed by recent advances in 
behavioral economics.
