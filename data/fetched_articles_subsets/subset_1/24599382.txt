DNA damage to cochlear hair cells caused by 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is essential 
for the development of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Human 8-oxoG DNA 
glycosylase1 (hOGG1) is a key enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway 
that eliminates 8-oxoG. Many epidemiological and functional studies have 
suggested that the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism (rs1052133) is associated with 
many diseases. The purpose of this investigation was to investigate whether the 
hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism in the human BER pathway is associated with genetic 
susceptibility to NIHL in a Chinese population. This polymorphism was genotyped 
among 612 workers with NIHL and 615 workers with normal hearing. We found that 
individuals with the hOGG1 Cys/Cys genotype had a statistically significantly 
increased risk of NIHL compared with those who carried the hOGG1 Ser/Ser 
genotype (adjusted OR=1.59, 95% CI=1.13-2.25) and this increased risk was more 
pronounced among the workers in the 15- to 25- and >25-year noise exposure time, 
85-92 dB(A) noise exposure level, ever smoking, and ever drinking groups, 
similar effects were also observed in a recessive model. In summary, our data 
suggested that the hOGG1 Cys/Cys genotype may be a genetic susceptibility marker 
for NIHL in the Chinese Han population.
