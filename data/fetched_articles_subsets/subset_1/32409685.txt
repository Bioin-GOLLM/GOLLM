Despite the improvement in clinical outcome with 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cisRA) 
+ anti-GD2 antibody + cytokine immunotherapy given in first response ~40% of 
high-risk neuroblastoma patients die of recurrent disease. MYCN genomic 
amplification is a biomarker of aggressive tumors in the childhood cancer 
neuroblastoma. MYCN expression is downregulated by 13-cisRA, a differentiating 
agent that is a component of neuroblastoma therapy. Although MYC amplification 
is rare in neuroblastoma at diagnosis, we report transcriptional activation of 
MYC medicated by the transcription factor OCT4, functionally replacing MYCN in 
13-cisRA-resistant progressive disease neuroblastoma in large panels of 
patient-derived cell lines and xenograft models. We identified novel 
OCT4-binding sites in the MYC promoter/enhancer region that regulated MYC 
expression via phosphorylation by MAPKAPK2 (MK2). OCT4 phosphorylation at the 
S111 residue by MK2 was upstream of MYC transcriptional activation. Expression 
of OCT4, MK2, and c-MYC was higher in progressive disease relative to 
pre-therapy neuroblastomas and was associated with inferior patient survival. 
OCT4 or MK2 knockdown decreased c-MYC expression and restored the sensitivity to 
13-cisRA. In conclusion, we demonstrated that high c-MYC expression independent 
of genomic amplification is associated with disease progression in 
neuroblastoma. MK2-mediated OCT4 transcriptional activation is a novel mechanism 
for activating the MYC oncogene in progressive disease neuroblastoma that 
provides a therapeutic target.
