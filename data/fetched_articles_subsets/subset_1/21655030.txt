Sickle cell disease is a congenital condition and its most common clinical 
manifestation is anemia due to chronic hemolysis. Persistent and accelerated 
hemolysis associated with multiple transfusions is a recognized risk factor for 
the development of cholelithiasis. The occurrence of gallstones is one of the 
most important manifestations of sickle cell disease in the digestive tract. 
Most gallstones are pigmented and characteristically occur at younger ages and 
the prevalence of cholelithiasis increases progressively with age, affecting 50% 
of young adults. Cholecystectomy is the most common surgical procedure performed 
in sickle cell disease patients. Anesthesia in this population of patients for 
major surgeries deserves special attention due to various complications 
particularly silent infarctions of end organs are common. We are reporting a 
14-year-old girl diagnosed with sickle cell anemia and β(+) thalassemia with 
cholelithiasis went for cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. Although the 
patient has both β(+) thalassemia and sickle cell disease component, the latter 
is of more concern for anesthesia.
