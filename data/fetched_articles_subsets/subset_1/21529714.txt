Accurate chromosome segregation requires assembly of the multiprotein 
kinetochore complex at centromeres. Although prior work identified the 
centromeric histone H3-variant CENP-A as the important upstream factor necessary 
for centromere specification, in human cells CENP-A is not sufficient for 
kinetochore assembly. Here, we demonstrate that two constitutive DNA-binding 
kinetochore components, CENP-C and CENP-T, function to direct kinetochore 
formation. Replacing the DNA-binding regions of CENP-C and CENP-T with alternate 
chromosome-targeting domains recruits these proteins to ectopic loci, resulting 
in CENP-A-independent kinetochore assembly. These ectopic kinetochore-like foci 
are functional based on the stoichiometric assembly of multiple kinetochore 
components, including the microtubule-binding KMN network, the presence of 
microtubule attachments, the microtubule-sensitive recruitment of the spindle 
checkpoint protein Mad2, and the segregation behavior of foci-containing 
chromosomes. We additionally find that CENP-T phosphorylation regulates the 
mitotic assembly of both endogenous and ectopic kinetochores. Thus, CENP-C and 
CENP-T form a critical regulated platform for vertebrate kinetochore assembly.
