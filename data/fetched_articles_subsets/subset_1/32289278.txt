Pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGG) are frequently driven by genetic alterations 
in the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK) pathway yet show 
unexplained variability in their clinical outcome. To address this, we 
characterized a cohort of >1,000 clinically annotated pLGG. Eighty-four percent 
of cases harbored a driver alteration, while those without an identified 
alteration also often exhibited upregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. pLGG could 
be broadly classified based on their alteration type. Rearrangement-driven 
tumors were diagnosed at a younger age, enriched for WHO grade I histology, 
infrequently progressed, and rarely resulted in death as compared with 
SNV-driven tumors. Further sub-classification of clinical-molecular correlates 
stratified pLGG into risk categories. These data highlight the biological and 
clinical differences between pLGG subtypes and opens avenues for future 
treatment refinement.
