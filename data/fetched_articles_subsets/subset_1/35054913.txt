Circadian rhythms are essential for the survival of all organisms, enabling them 
to predict daily changes in the environment and time their behaviour 
appropriately. The molecular basis of such rhythms is the circadian clock, a 
self-sustaining molecular oscillator comprising a transcriptional-translational 
feedback loop. This must be continually readjusted to remain in alignment with 
the external world through a process termed entrainment, in which the phase of 
the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) is adjusted in 
response to external time cues. In mammals, the primary time cue, or 
"zeitgeber", is light, which inputs directly to the SCN where it is integrated 
with additional non-photic zeitgebers. The molecular mechanisms underlying 
photic entrainment are complex, comprising a number of regulatory factors. This 
review will outline the photoreception pathways mediating photic entrainment, 
and our current understanding of the molecular pathways that drive it in the 
SCN.
