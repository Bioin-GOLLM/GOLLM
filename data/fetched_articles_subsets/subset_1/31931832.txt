BACKGROUND: Patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) 
often grieve over a low quality of life brought about by chronic pain. In our 
previous studies, we determined that neuroinflammation of the spinal dorsal horn 
(SDH) was associated with mechanisms of interstitial cystitis. Moreover, it has 
been shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) participates in the 
regulation of neuroinflammation and pathological pain through BDNF-TrkB 
signaling; however, whether it plays a role in cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced 
cystitis remains unclear. This study aimed to confirm whether BDNF-TrkB 
signaling modulates neuroinflammation and mechanical allodynia in CYP-induced 
cystitis and determine how it occurs.
METHODS: Systemic intraperitoneal injection of CYP was performed to establish a 
rat cystitis model. BDNF-TrkB signaling was modulated by intraperitoneal 
injection of the TrkB receptor antagonist, ANA-12, or intrathecal injection of 
exogenous BDNF. Mechanical allodynia in the suprapubic region was assessed using 
the von Frey filaments test. The expression of BDNF, TrkB, p-TrkB, Iba1, GFAP, 
p-p38, p-JNK, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the L6-S1 SDH was measured by Western blotting 
and immunofluorescence analysis.
RESULTS: BDNF-TrkB signaling was upregulated significantly in the SDH after CYP 
was injected. Similarly, the expressions of Iba1, GFAP, p-p38, p-JNK, IL-1β, and 
TNF-α in the SDH were all upregulated. Treatment with ANA-12 could attenuate 
mechanical allodynia, restrain activation of astrocytes and microglia and 
alleviate neuroinflammation. Besides, the intrathecal injection of exogenous 
BDNF further decreased the mechanical withdrawal threshold, promoted activation 
of astrocytes and microglia, and increased the release of TNF-α and IL-1β in the 
SDH of our CYP-induced cystitis model.
CONCLUSIONS: In our CYP-induced cystitis model, BDNF promoted the activation of 
astrocytes and microglia to release TNF-α and IL-1β, aggravating 
neuroinflammation and leading to mechanical allodynia through BDNF-TrkB-p38/JNK 
signaling.
