Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) inevitably progresses to a blast phase by 
mechanisms that are not well understood. The MUC1-C oncoprotein is expressed in 
CML blasts but not chronic phase cells. The present studies demonstrate that 
treatment of KU812 and K562 CML cells with a cell-penetrating MUC1-C inhibitor, 
designated GO-203, is associated with increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
and depletion of glutathione. GO-203 treatment resulted in the complete 
downregulation of Bcr-Abl expression and induced cell cycle arrest by a 
ROS-mediated mechanism that was blocked by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. 
Progression of CML to blast crisis has been linked to dysregulation of 
Wnt/β-catenin signaling and an arrest of differentiation. The present results 
show that inhibition of MUC1-C induces ROS-mediated suppression of β-catenin 
expression and induction of a differentiated myeloid phenotype. Our studies also 
show that GO-203 treatment is associated with ROS-induced decreases in ATP and 
loss of survival by late apoptosis/necrosis. These findings demonstrate that 
inhibition of the MUC1-C oncoprotein in CML cells disrupts redox balance and 
thereby 1) downregulates expression of both Bcr-Abl and β-catenin and 2) induces 
terminal myeloid differentiation by ROS-mediated mechanisms.
