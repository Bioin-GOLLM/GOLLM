Thyroid nodules are prevalent in upto 68% of randomly selected individuals in 
whom high resolution ultrasound is performed. The majority of nodules are 
benign. The use of ultrasound coupled with FNAC has dramatically reduced the 
number of patients who undergo surgery for nodules. The six tier Bethesda 
scoring system has reduced variability and increased the ability to clinicians 
to guide patients with thyroid nodules. There is good correlation between 
cytology and histopathologic outcomes. A significant proportion of patients will 
however fall into an indeterminate category. The availability of molecular 
markers enhanced with next generation sequencing technology and the expression 
classifier are added diagnostic aids that can help in management. However these 
are not available in many countries and in resource limited settings. A 
pragmatic approach to the diagnosis of indeterminate nodules includes utilising 
pre and post test probability, clinical acumen, correlation of ultrasound 
findings and expert opinion in some settings. Using this approach high risk 
patients can be appropriately chosen for surgery while relegating patients with 
lower risk to watchful followup.
