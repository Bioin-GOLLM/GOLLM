Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a family of nuclear 
hormone receptors that control the expression of genes involved in a variety of 
physiologic processes, through heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor and 
complex formation with various cofactors. Drugs or treatment regimens that 
combine the beneficial effects of PPARα and γ agonism present an attractive 
therapeutic strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Aleglitazar is a 
dual PPARα/γ agonist currently in phase III clinical development for the 
treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who recently experienced an 
acute coronary event. The potency and efficacy of aleglitazar was evaluated in a 
head-to-head comparison with other PPARα, γ and δ ligands. A comprehensive, 
12-concentration dose-response analysis using a cell-based assay showed 
aleglitazar to be highly potent, with EC(50) values of 5 nM and 9 nM for PPARα 
and PPARγ, respectively. Cofactor recruitment profiles confirmed that 
aleglitazar is a potent and balanced activator of PPARα and γ. The efficacy and 
potency of aleglitazar are discussed in relation to other dual PPARα/γ agonists, 
in context with the published X-ray crystal structures of both PPARα and γ.
