OBJECTIVE: Both tonsillar hypertrophy and obesity contribute to pediatric 
sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Tonsillectomy addresses anatomical obstruction 
causing SDB; however, it may adversely affect the obesity profile 
postoperatively. Herein, we investigate posttonsillectomy body mass index (BMI) 
changes in pediatric patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
SETTING: Tertiary, pediatric urban academic center.
METHODS: All patients undergoing tonsillectomy from January 1, 2016, to December 
31, 2016, were included. Patients' age, sex, surgical indication, and 
preoperative BMI were recorded. Postoperative BMI data were collected between 
March 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017. Statistical analysis was performed using a 
generalized regression model, using BMI percentile-for-age weight status.
RESULTS: A total of 1153 patients were included (50% female), with age ranging 
from 2.0 to 19.5 years (mean [SD], 7.6 [4.0]). The majority (87.8%) had 
tonsillectomy for SDB. Of the cohort, 560 (48.6%) had available follow-up BMI 
data. The BMI percentile on the day of the surgery had a median of 65.8, and the 
BMI percentile on follow-up had a median of 76.4. The median time to follow-up 
was 197 days with a range of 50 to 605 days. Higher postoperative BMI percentile 
strongly correlated to higher preoperative BMI percentile (P < .001), as well as 
younger age (P < .001), male sex (P = .0005), and SDB as a surgical indication 
(P = .003).
CONCLUSION: We observed a significant increase in BMI percentile following 
tonsillectomy, which accounted for a significantly higher proportion of the 
cohort being classified as overweight or obese postoperatively. These findings 
necessitate greater preoperative counseling, closer follow-up, and adjunctive 
measures for obesity management in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy.
