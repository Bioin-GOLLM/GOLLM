Zebrafish is gaining popularity as a vertebrate model for screening small 
molecules that affect specific phenotypes or genetic pathways. In this study, we 
present a targeted drug screen to identify drug modifiers of the melanocyte 
migration defect of a temperature-sensitive allele of the Kit receptor tyrosine 
kinase, kit(ts). We first test two candidate drugs, the 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase kinase inhibitor (LY294002) and the Erk/MAP kinase 
inhibitor (PD98059), for their effect on melanocyte migration and survival. We 
find that LY294002 enhances the migration defect of kit(ts), implicating the 
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase kinase pathway in promoting kit-dependent 
melanocyte migration, but not survival. We then used the kit(ts)-sensitized 
genetic background to screen a panel of 1280 pharmacologically active drugs to 
identify drug enhancers and suppressors of the kit(ts) melanocyte migration 
defect. We identified three drug enhancers of migration, two of which, 
Papaverine and Isoliquiritigenin, specifically enhance the kit(ts) migration 
defect, while 8-DPAT affected both melanocyte migration and survival. These 
drugs now provide additional experimental tools for investigating the mechanisms 
of kit-promoted melanocyte migration and survival in the zebrafish embryo.
