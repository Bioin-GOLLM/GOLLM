Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria can rarely present as cerebral ischemia and 
stroke due to arterial thrombosis. However, it should be considered in a young 
patient with bone marrow failure features, systemic thromboses, and hemolysis. 
The variants of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria pose a diagnostic challenge 
and hence are important to recognize. We report a case of a 28-years-old female 
with Herlyn Werner Wunderlich Syndrome who presented with an ischemic 
cerebrovascular accident, pancytopenia, hemoglobinuria, and widespread abdominal 
thromboses suggestive of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The patient was 
managed symptomatically and referred to a hematologist.
