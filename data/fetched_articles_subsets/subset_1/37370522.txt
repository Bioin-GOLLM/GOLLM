Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane proteins important for directing 
immune responses. Their primary role is to recognize pathogens based on 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) characteristics. TLR2 is categorized as a 
pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that is important for the recognition of 
pathogens. Nucleotide variation in the coding region determines the conformation 
of the TLR protein, affecting its protein domain efficiency. This study aimed to 
identify SNPs in the coding region of TLR2 to enhance available genetic tools 
for improving health and production in swamp buffalo. A total of 50 buffaloes 
were randomly sampled from the northeastern part of Thailand for genomic DNA 
extraction and sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were aligned and compared with 
cattle and river buffalo based on the database. The results showed, there were 
29 SNP locations in swamp buffalo and 14 different locations in both cattle and 
buffaloes. Haplotype analysis revealed that 27 haplotypes occurred. Swamp 
buffalo were identified from 13 SNPs based on biallelic analysis, which found 
eight synonymous and five nonsynonymous SNPs. Nucleotide diversity (π) was 0.16, 
indicating genetic diversity. Genetic diversity (haplotype diversity; HD) was 
high at 0.99 ± 0.04. This indicates a high probability that the two sample 
haplotypes are different. The π and HD values are important indicators of the 
genetic diversity of the swamp buffalo population. In summary, the Thai swamp 
buffalo population detected a polymorphism of the coding region of the TRL2 
gene. Therefore, further, in-depth study of the relationship between these genes 
in the immune system and disease resistance should be recommended.
