OBJECTIVE: Orofacial clefts (OFCs) are one of the most common birth defects in 
humans. They are the subject of a number of investigations aimed at elucidating 
the bases of their complex mode of inheritance involving both genetic and 
environmental factors. Genes belonging to the folate pathway have been among the 
most studied. The aim of the investigation was to replicate previous studies 
reporting evidence of association between polymorphisms of folate related genes 
and the occurrence of non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate 
(NSCL/P), using three independent samples of different ancestry: from Tibet, 
Bangladesh and Iran, respectively.
DESIGN: Specifically, the polymorphisms rs1801133 of MTHFR, rs1801198 of TCN2, 
and rs4920037 of CBS, were tested.
RESULTS: A decreased risk of NSCL/P was observed in patients presenting the 
C677T variant at MTHFR gene (relative risk for heterozygotes=0.53; 95% 
confidence interval [C.I.]=0.32-0.87). The investigated polymorphisms mapping at 
TCN2 and CBS genes did not provide any evidence of association.
CONCLUSION: Overall, these results indicate that NSCL/P risk factors differ 
among populations and confirm the importance of testing putative susceptibility 
variants in different genetic backgrounds.
