IMPORTANCE: Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most 
common cause of genetic Parkinson disease (PD) known to date. The clinical 
features of manifesting LRRK2 mutation carriers are generally indistinguishable 
from those of patients with sporadic PD. However, some PD cases associated with 
LRRK2 mutations lack Lewy bodies (LBs), a neuropathological hallmark of PD. We 
investigated whether the presence or absence of LBs correlates with different 
clinical features in LRRK2-related PD.
OBSERVATIONS: We describe genetic, clinical, and neuropathological findings of 
37 cases of LRRK2-related PD including 33 published and 4 unpublished cases 
through October 2013. Among the different mutations, the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation 
was most frequently associated with LB pathology. Nonmotor features of cognitive 
impairment/dementia, anxiety, and orthostatic hypotension were correlated with 
the presence of LBs. In contrast, a primarily motor phenotype was associated 
with a lack of LBs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first report of 
clinicopathological correlations in a series of LRRK2-related PD cases. Findings 
from this selected group of patients with PD demonstrated that parkinsonian 
motor features can occur in the absence of LBs. However, LB pathology in 
LRRK2-related PD may be a marker for a broader parkinsonian symptom complex 
including cognitive impairment.
