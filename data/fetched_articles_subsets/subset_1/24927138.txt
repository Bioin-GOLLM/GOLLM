PURPOSE: Previous evidence has indicated that the lumican (LUM) gene is a 
candidate susceptibility gene of high myopia; however, the association between 
LUM promoter regions rs3759223 polymorphism and high myopia remains 
controversial and ambiguous. This study performed a meta-analysis to clarify the 
association between the rs3759223 polymorphism and high myopia risk.
METHODS: Eligible studies were identified by comprehensive search of PubMed, 
EMBASE, Web of Science, and Chinese Biomedical Literature database. The crude 
odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
used to estimate the association between the rs3759223 polymorphism and high 
myopia susceptibility. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to 
identify the source of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Finally, six studies including 1238 cases and 1059 healthy controls 
were included. Meta-analyses showed no association between rs3759223 
polymorphism and high myopia susceptibility in all genetic models (CC vs. TT, OR 
= 1.089; 95% CI, 0.690 to 1.718; CT vs. TT, OR = 0.865; 95% CI, 0.646 to 1.157; 
CC + CT vs. TT, OR = 1.202; 95% CI, 0.730 to 1.980; CC vs. CT + TT, OR = 0.914; 
95% CI, 0.771 to 1.083) and no significance in subgroup analyses according to 
the definition of high myopia (based on more myopic than -6.00 diopters vs. not 
based on more myopic than -6.00 diopters). Publication bias was not evident in 
this study.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis has suggested that there is a lack of 
association of the rs3759223 polymorphism with high myopia risk. However, 
further large and well-designed studies with the consideration of LUM gene locus 
interactions and gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are still required 
to further evaluate high myopia risk.
