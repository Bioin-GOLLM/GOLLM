PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines recent developments in human genetic 
susceptibility to enteropathogens that cause infectious diarrhea.
RECENT FINDINGS: The affinity of specific norovirus genogroups to different 
histoblood group antigens (HBGAs) on secretor cells has been studied in 
different epidemiologic studies. HBGAs are also used as receptors by Vibrio 
cholerae with different degrees of affinity between biotypes. Polymorphisms in 
the CD14, lactoferrin and osteoprotegerin promoter genes were associated to 
diarrhea in travelers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL-8 genes are 
also associated to increased risk for enteroaggregative Escherichia coli and 
Clostridium difficile infection. IL-10 haplotypes were associated to 
enterotoxigenic E. coli associated diarrhea in exposed individuals. A 
family-based study showed a significant association of the LPLUNC1 gene and 
cholera. The major histocompatibility complex class II antigens are associated 
to different degrees of susceptibility and resistance to Salmonella, 
Cryptosporidium and Entamoeba infection.
SUMMARY: Variants in genes that encode molecules that mediate attachment, 
pathogen recognition, inflammatory cytokine response, innate and acquired 
immunity are being identified as determinants of host genetic susceptibility to 
infectious diarrhea.
