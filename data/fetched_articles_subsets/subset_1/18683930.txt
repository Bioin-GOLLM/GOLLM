We report an advanced chemoenzymatic strategy for the direct fluorescence 
detection, proteomic analysis, and cellular imaging of O-GlcNAc-modified 
proteins. O-GlcNAc residues are selectively labeled with fluorescent or biotin 
tags using an engineered galactosyltransferase enzyme and [3 + 2] azide-alkyne 
cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrate that this approach can be used for 
direct in-gel detection and mass spectrometric identification of O-GlcNAc 
proteins, identifying 146 novel glycoproteins from the mammalian brain. 
Furthermore, we show that the method can be exploited to quantify dynamic 
changes in cellular O-GlcNAc levels and to image O-GlcNAc-glycosylated proteins 
within cells. As such, this strategy enables studies of O-GlcNAc glycosylation 
that were previously inaccessible and provides a new tool for uncovering the 
physiological functions of O-GlcNAc.
