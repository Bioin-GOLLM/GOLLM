Differences in gene expression in the CNS influence behavior and disease 
susceptibility. To systematically explore the role of normal variation in 
expression on hippocampal structure and function, we generated an online 
microarray database for a diverse panel of strains of mice, including most 
common inbred strains and numerous recombinant inbred lines 
(www.genenetwork.org). Using this resource, coexpression networks for families 
of genes can be generated rapidly to test causal models related to function. The 
data set is optimized for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and was used to 
identify over 5500 QTLs that modulate mRNA levels. We describe a wide variety of 
analyses and novel synthetic approaches that take advantage of this resource, 
and demonstrate how both the data and associated tools can be applied to the 
study of gene regulation in the hippocampus and relations to structure and 
function.
