A 19-year-old male presented with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. He was 
diagnosed with acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. After following the Group 
for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL) 2003 protocol that 
incorporates L-asparaginase (L-Asp) treatment, blood glucose levels became 
elevated for more than one year and insulin secretion was depleted. 
Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and anti-islet antigen 2 (IA-2) antibody 
levels were both positive, which is rare. The patient's HLA genotype was 
sensitive for type 1 diabetes. L-Asp can cause transient hyperglycemia as a side 
effect. However, cases with the anti-GAD antibody have not been reported in 
L-Asp-induced diabetes. In summary, L-Asp-induced continuous hyperglycemia might 
be associated with a type 1 diabetes-related HLA genotype through elevations of 
anti-GAD and anti-IA-2 antibodies.
