OBJECTIVE: The interval between induction and delivery may change in association 
with different polymorphisms in genes regulating inflammation.
STUDY DESIGN: Seventy participants in a trial for induction of labor at term 
were tested for a -765 G>C cyclooxygenase-2 and an intron 2 length interleukin-1 
receptor antagonist gene polymorphism.
RESULTS: The interleukin-1 receptor antagonist allele 2 frequency was 33.3% in 
the 12 women who delivered at < or =10 hours, compared with 13.8% in those 
delivered >10 hours (P = .03). The interleukin-1 receptor antagonist allele 2 
frequency was 25.0% in women induced because of postdates as opposed to 7.9% 
induced for other indications (P = .01). The cyclooxygenase-2 allele C frequency 
was 30.0% in 35 women delivered at < or =20 hours as opposed to 11.4% in women 
delivered at >20 hours (P = .01). The cyclooxygenase-2 allele C frequency was 
26.9% in 26 subjects induced because of postdates as opposed to 13.6% induced 
for other indications (P = .07).
CONCLUSION: Cyclooxygenase-2 allele C and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist 
allele 2 are associated with a reduced time interval from labor induction to 
delivery.
