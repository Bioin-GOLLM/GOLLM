The co-occurrence of resistance to thyroid hormone beta (RTHβ) and myotonic 
dystrophy type 1 (DM1) was observed in a Japanese family. Two mutations, P453A 
and C36Y, were identified in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) gene. 
Whereas family members with THRBP453A exhibited RTHβ, two members with THRBC36Y 
but without THRBP453A had normal thyroid function. Two members, one with RTHβ 
and the other without, had a triplet expansion in the dystrophia myotonia 
protein kinase gene, a hallmark of DM1. The member with both RTHβ and DM1 
developed atrial fibrillation at the age of 16 years, suggesting a synergistic 
impact on the heart.
