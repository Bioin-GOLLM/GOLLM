OBJECTIVE: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a common neurodegenerative condition 
for which the underlying cause is uncertain in many patients. We identified a 
patient with clinical features suggestive of MND but additional cardiac and 
metabolic symptoms. We wished to determine if the clinical features were due to 
a mitochondrial DNA mutation.
METHODS: The brain and spinal cord were studied using neuropathological 
techniques and agenetic defect investigated in individual neurons.
RESULTS: There were atypical neuropathological features and genetic studies 
identified a pathogenic, heteroplasmic mitochondria tRNA(Ile) (4274T>C) 
mutation.
INTERPRETATION: This case adds to the phenotypic variation seen in mitochondrial 
DNA disease but also highlights the potential role of mitochondrial dysfunction 
in the cause of MND.
