Intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i dysregulation plays an important role in the 
pathophysiology of iron overload cardiomyopathy. Although either iron chelators 
or antioxidants provide cardioprotection, a comparison of the efficacy of 
deferoxamine (DFO), deferiprone (DFP), deferasirox (DFX), N-acetyl cysteine 
(NAC) or a combination of DFP plus NAC on cardiac [Ca2+]i homeostasis in chronic 
iron overload has never been investigated. Male Wistar rats were fed with either 
a normal diet or a high iron (HFe) diet for 4 months. At 2 months, HFe rats were 
divided into 6 groups and treated with either a vehicle, DFO (25 mg/kg/day), DFP 
(75 mg/kg/day), DFX (20 mg/kg/day), NAC (100 mg/kg/day), or combined DFP plus 
NAC. At 4 months, the number of cardiac T-type calcium channels was increased, 
whereas cardiac sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) was 
decreased, leading to cardiac iron overload and impaired cardiac [Ca2+]i 
homeostasis. All pharmacological interventions restored SERCA levels. Although 
DFO, DFP, DFX or NAC alone shared similar efficacy in improving cardiac [Ca2+]i 
homeostasis, only DFP + NAC restored cardiac [Ca2+]i homeostasis, leading to 
restoring left ventricular function in the HFe-fed rats. Thus, the combined 
DFP + NAC was more effective than any monotherapy in restoring cardiac [Ca2+]i 
homeostasis, leading to restored myocardial contractility in iron-overloaded 
rats.
