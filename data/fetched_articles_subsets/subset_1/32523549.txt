Neuronal Kv7 channel generates a low voltage-activated potassium current known 
as the M-current. The M-current can be suppressed by various neurotransmitters 
that activate Gq-coupled receptors. Because the M-current stabilizes membrane 
potential at the resting membrane potential, its suppression transiently 
increase neuronal excitability. However, its physiological and pathological 
roles in vivo is not well understood to date. This review summarizes the 
molecular mechanism underlying M-current suppression, and why it remained 
elusive for many years. I also summarize how regulation of neuronal Kv7 channel 
contributes to anti-seizure action of valproic acid through inhibition of 
palmitoylation of a Kv7 channel binding protein, and discuss about a potential 
link with anti-seizure mechanisms of medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet.
