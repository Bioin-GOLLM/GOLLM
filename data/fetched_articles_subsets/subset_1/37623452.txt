BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented pain as an important concern for 
quality of life (QoL) and one of the most challenging manifestations for cancer 
patients. Thus, cancer pain management (CPM) plays a key role in treating pain 
related to cancer. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate CPM, 
with an emphasis on personalized medicine, and introduce new 
pharmacogenomics-based procedures for detecting and treating cancer pain 
patients.
METHODS: This study systematically reviewed PubMed from 1990 to 2023 using 
keywords such as cancer, pain, and personalized medicine. A total of 597 
publications were found, and after multiple filtering processes, 75 papers were 
included. In silico analyses were performed using the GeneCards, STRING-MODEL, 
miRTargetLink2, and PharmGKB databases.
RESULTS: The results reveal that recent reports have mainly focused on 
personalized medicine strategies for CPM, and pharmacogenomics-based data are 
rapidly being introduced. The literature review of the 75 highly relevant 
publications, combined with the bioinformatics results, identified a list of 57 
evidence-based genes as the primary gene list for further personalized medicine 
approaches. The most frequently mentioned genes were CYP2D6, COMT, and OPRM1. 
Moreover, among the 127 variants identified through both the literature review 
and data mining in the PharmGKB database, 21 variants remain as potential 
candidates for whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. Interestingly, 
hsa-miR-34a-5p and hsa-miR-146a-5p were suggested as putative circulating 
biomarkers for cancer pain prognosis and diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study highlights personalized medicine as the 
most promising strategy in CPM, utilizing pharmacogenomics-based approaches to 
alleviate cancer pain.
