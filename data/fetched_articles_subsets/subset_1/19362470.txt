Blocking the interaction between phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-containing activated 
receptors and the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of the growth factor 
receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb 2) is considered to be an effective and 
non-cytotoxic strategy to develop new anti-proliferate agents due to its 
potential to shut down the Ras activation pathway. In this study, a series of 
phosphotyrosine containing cyclic pentapeptides were designed and synthesized 
based upon the phage library derived cyclopeptide, G1TE. A comprehensive SAR 
study was also carried out to develop potent Grb2-SH2 domain antagonists based 
upon this novel template. With both the peptidomimetic optimization of the amino 
acid side-chains and the constraint of the backbone conformation guided by 
molecular modeling, we developed several potent antagonists with low micromolar 
range binding affinity, such as cyclic peptide 15 with an K(d)=0.359microM, 
which is providing a novel template for the development of Grb2-SH2 domain 
antagonists as potential therapeutics for certain cancers.
