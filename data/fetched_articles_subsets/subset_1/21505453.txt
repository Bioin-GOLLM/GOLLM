BACKGROUND: Human breast carcinoma cells secrete an adenosine 5'-diphosphate 
transphosphorylase (sNDPK) known to induce endothelial cell tubulogenesis in a 
P2Y receptor-dependent manner. We examined sNDPK secretion and its effects on 
human endothelial cells.
METHODS: Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) secretion was measured by western 
blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while transphosphorylase activity 
was measured using the luciferin-luciferase ATP assay. Activation of MAPK was 
determined by western blot analysis, immunofluorescence and endothelial cell 
proliferation and migration.
RESULTS: A panel of breast cancer cell lines with origin as ductal carcinoma, 
adenocarcinoma or medullary carcinoma, secrete sNDPK-A/B. Addition of purified 
NDPK-B to endothelial cultures activated VEGFR-2 and Erk(1/2), both of which 
were blocked by inhibitors of NDPK and P2Y receptors. Activation of VEGFR-2 and 
ErK(1/2) by 2-methylthio-ATP (2MeS-ATP) was blocked by pretreatment with the 
P2Y(1)-specific antagonist MRS2179, the proto-oncogene non-receptor tyrosine 
kinase (Src) inhibitor PP2 or the VEGFR-2 antagonist SU1498. Nucleoside 
diphosphate kinase-B stimulates cell growth and migration in a 
concentration-dependent manner comparable to the effect of vascular endothelial 
growth factor. Treatment of endothelial cells with either NDPK-B or 2MeS-ATP 
induced migration, blocked by P2Y(1), Src or VEGFR-2 antagonists.
CONCLUSION: sNDPK supports angiogenesis. Understanding the mechanism of action 
of sNDPK and P2Y(1) nucleotide signalling in metastasis and angiogenesis 
represent new therapeutic targets for anti-angiogenic therapies to benefit 
patients.
