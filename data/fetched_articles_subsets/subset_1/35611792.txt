Acute kidney injury (AKI) has a high mortality rate, but its pathogenesis 
remains unclear Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated renal tubular epithelial 
pyroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of AKI. NLR family of pyrin domains 
containing 3 (NLRP3) plays an important role in pyroptosis. To further 
understand the transcriptional regulation mechanism of NLRP3, the peripheral 
blood of patients with AKI was analyzed in this study, showing that the levels 
of NLRP3 and cell pyroptosis in patients with AKI were significantly higher than 
those in normal controls. Furthermore, elevated levels of NLRP3 and cell 
pyroptosis were found in renal tubular epithelial cells after LPS treatment. 
Transcription factor ETS Proto-Oncogene 1 (ETS1) could bind to the upstream 
promoter transcription site of NLRP3 to transactivate NLRP3 in renal tubular 
epithelial cells. The cell pyroptosis level also decreased by knocking down 
ETS1. It is concluded that knocking down of ETS1 may reduce the renal tubular 
epithelial pyroptosis by regulating the transcription of NLRP3, thus relieving 
AKI. ETS1 is expected to be a molecular target for the treatment of AKI.
