BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene is strongly 
associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Transport of glucocerebrosidase to the 
lysosome involves the protein encoded by the SCARB2 gene. An association between 
the common SNP rs6812193, upstream of SCARB2, and PD has been reported 
previously. The role of exonic variants in the SCARB2 gene in PD has not been 
examined.
METHODS: We studied the role of exonic variants in SCARB2 and tried to replicate 
the association between the SNP rs6812193 and PD in a German and Austrian 
sample. Screening of all SCARB2 exons by high-resolution melting curve analysis 
was performed in 376 German PD patients. The SNP rs6812193 was analyzed in 984 
PD patients and 1014 general population controls.
RESULTS: We identified no novel exonic variants in SCARB2 but confirmed the 
association between SNP rs6812193 and PD (OR, 0.86; P=.02).
