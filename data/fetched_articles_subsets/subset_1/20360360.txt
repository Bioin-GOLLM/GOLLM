viral infection.

Expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), its more fluorescent mutant forms 
(e.g., EGFP [enhanced GFP]), or their fusion protein derivatives, affords a 
number of informative possibilities in cellular neuroscience. EGFP is a soluble 
protein and appears to be homogeneously distributed within the cytosol of 
neurons when expressed. Thus, it reveals the structure of the neuron, including 
the cell body, and axonal and dendritic arbors. It is also sufficiently bright 
to reveal detailed structures such as axonal boutons and dendritic spines. When 
expressed as a fusion protein, EGFP can provide information about the 
distribution characteristics of the proteins within neurons. Furthermore, during 
single-cell electrophysiological studies, such expression can direct the 
investigator to record from a cell carrying a foreign gene. In this protocol, we 
describe the use of the Sindbis pseudovirus expression system to deliver GFP to 
neurons. Sindbis is a member of the alphaviruses, which are plus-stranded RNA 
viruses. This protocol uses the DH(26S) strain, which preferentially infects 
neurons over glia (50:1). Two infection methods are given: one for dissociated 
hippocampal cultured neurons and one for organotypic hippocampal slices.
