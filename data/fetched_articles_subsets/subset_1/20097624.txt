Helicases are ubiquitous enzymes found in all organisms that are necessary for 
all (or virtually all) aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. The Pif1 helicase 
family is a group of 5'-->3' directed, ATP-dependent, super family IB helicases 
found in nearly all eukaryotes. Here, we review the discovery, evolution, and 
what is currently known about these enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScPif1 
and ScRrm3), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SpPfh1), Trypanosoma brucei (TbPIF1, 2, 
5, and 8), mice (mPif1), and humans (hPif1). Pif1 helicases variously affect 
telomeric, ribosomal, and mitochondrial DNA replication, as well as Okazaki 
fragment maturation, and in at least some cases affect these processes by using 
their helicase activity to disrupt stable nucleoprotein complexes. While the 
functions of these enzymes vary within and between organisms, it is evident that 
Pif1 family helicases are crucial for both nuclear and mitochondrial genome 
maintenance.
