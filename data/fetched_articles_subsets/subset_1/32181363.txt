Adenine base editors, which were developed by engineering a transfer RNA 
adenosine deaminase enzyme (TadA) into a DNA editing enzyme (TadA*), enable 
precise modification of A:T to G⋮C base pairs. Here, we use molecular dynamics 
simulations to uncover the structural and functional roles played by the initial 
mutations in the onset of the DNA editing activity by TadA*. Atomistic insights 
reveal that early mutations lead to intricate conformational changes in the 
structure of TadA*. In particular, the first mutation, Asp108Asn, induces an 
enhancement in the binding affinity of TadA to DNA. In silico and in vivo 
reversion analyses verify the importance of this single mutation in imparting 
functional promiscuity to TadA* and demonstrate that TadA* performs DNA base 
editing as a monomer rather than a dimer.
