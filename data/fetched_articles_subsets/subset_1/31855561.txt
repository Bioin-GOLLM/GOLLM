Obesity is associated with polymorphisms of the fat mass and obesity associated 
gene (FTO). This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association of the 
rs9930506 FTO gene polymorphism and obesity. To the best of our knowledge, this 
study is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the relation between FTO rs9930506 
polymorphism and obesity. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase to 
identify studies investigating the relations between the rs9930506 FTO gene 
polymorphism and obesity risk. We pooled adjusted odds ratios (OR) as overall 
and in continent subgroups. A Fixed-effects model was used to analyze the 
results of these studies in dominant and recessive models. By examining 3337 
obesity cases and 3159 healthy controls, we identified 8 eligible case-control 
studies. Considering the dominant model of inheritance, there was a relationship 
between the rs9939506 polymorphism and obesity (OR=1.34 [1.03- 1.74]). The 
association remained significant in the European subgroup (OR=1.68 [1.2-2.36]), 
but not in the Asian subgroup. Using the recessive model, we also found a 
significant relationship when the overall association was investigated (OR=2.47; 
95% CI 1.56-3.91). In conclusion, this study identified that the carriers of the 
risk allele of FTO rs9930506 polymorphism are at higher risk for obesity.
