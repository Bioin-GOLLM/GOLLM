INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate genetic risk factors in 
term-born children with antenatal periventricular hemorrhagic infarction (PVHI), 
presumed antenatal periventricular venous infarction and periventricular 
hemorrhagic infarction in preterm neonates.
METHODS: Genetic analysis and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 85 
children: term-born children (≥36 gestational weeks) with antenatal 
periventricular hemorrhagic infarction (n = 6) or presumed antenatal (n = 40) 
periventricular venous infarction and preterm children (<36 gestational weeks) 
with periventricular hemorrhagic infarction (n = 39). Genetic testing was 
performed using exome or large gene panel (n = 6700 genes) sequencing.
RESULTS: Pathogenic variants associated with stroke were found in 11 of 85 
(12.9%) children with periventricular hemorrhagic infarction/periventricular 
venous infarction. Among the pathogenic variants, COL4A1/A2 and COL5A1 variants 
were found in 7 of 11 (63%) children. Additionally, 2 children had pathogenic 
variants associated with coagulopathy, whereas 2 other children had other 
variants associated with stroke. Children with collagenopathies had 
significantly more often bilateral multifocal stroke with severe white matter 
loss and diffuse hyperintensities in the white matter, moderate to severe 
hydrocephalus, moderate to severe decrease in size of the ipsilesional basal 
ganglia and thalamus compared to children with periventricular hemorrhagic 
infarction/periventricular venous infarction without genetic changes in the 
studied genes (P ≤ .01). Severe motor deficit and epilepsy developed more often 
in children with collagenopathies compared to children without genetic variants 
(P = .0013, odds ratio [OR] = 233, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.8-531; and 
P = .025, OR = 7.3, 95% CI: 1.3-41, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Children with periventricular hemorrhagic 
infarction/periventricular venous infarction have high prevalence of pathogenic 
variants in collagene genes (COL4A1/A2 and COL5A1). Genetic testing should be 
considered for all children with periventricular hemorrhagic 
infarction/periventricular venous infarction; COL4A1/A2 and COL5A1/A2 genes 
should be investigated first.
