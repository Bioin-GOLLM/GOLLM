A common practice in modern QSAR modelling is to derive models by variable 
selection methods working on large descriptor pools. As pointed out previously, 
this is intrinsically burdened with the risk of finding random correlations. 
Therefore it is desirable to perform tests showing the performance of models 
built on random data. In this contribution, we introduce a simple and freely 
available software tool SCRAMBLE'N'GAMBLE that is aimed at facilitating data 
preparation for y-randomization and pseudo-descriptors tests. Then, four 
close-to-real-world modelling situations are analysed. The tests indicate what 
the quality of obtained QSAR models is like in comparison to chance models 
derived from random data. The non-randomness is not the only requirement for a 
good QSAR model, however, it is a good practice to consider it together with 
internal statistical parameters and possible physical interpretations of a 
model.
