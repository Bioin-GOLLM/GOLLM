The three types of interferon (IFNs) are essential for immunity against at least 
some viruses in the mouse model of experimental infections, type I IFNs 
displaying the broadest and strongest anti-viral activity. Consistently, human 
genetic studies have shown that type II IFN is largely redundant for immunity 
against viruses in the course of natural infections. The precise contributions 
of human type I and III IFNs remain undefined. However, various inborn errors of 
anti-viral IFN immunity have been described, which can result in either broad or 
narrow immunological and viral phenotypes. The broad disorders impair the 
response to (STAT1, TYK2) or the production of at least type I and type III IFNs 
following multiple stimuli (NEMO), resulting in multiple viral infections at 
various sites, including herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). The narrow disorders 
impair exclusively (TLR3) or mostly (UNC-93B, TRIF, TRAF3) the TLR3-dependent 
induction of type I and III IFNs, leading to HSE in apparently otherwise healthy 
individuals. These recent discoveries highlight the importance of human type I 
and III IFNs in protective immunity against viruses, including the TLR3-IFN 
pathway in protection against HSE.
