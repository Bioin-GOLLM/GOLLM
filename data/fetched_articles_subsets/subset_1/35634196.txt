Myeloid sarcoma (MS), is a rare extramedullary tumor with a poor prognosis and 
high recurrence rate. Microtransplantation is one of the alternative methods of 
traditional transplantation, which does not rely on HLA complete matching, has 
low toxicity and may retain part of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. It has 
been reported that microtransplantation can significantly improve the survival 
rate of elderly AML patients. At present, there is no report on the application 
of micro transplantation in MS. We will report two cases of MS treated by micro 
transplantation. The disease-free survival was 66 months and 55 months 
respectively.
