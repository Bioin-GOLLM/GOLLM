Tau deposition is one of two hallmark features of biologically defined 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is more closely related to cognitive decline than 
amyloidosis. Further, not all amyloid-positive individuals develop tauopathy, 
resulting in wide heterogeneity in clinical outcomes across the population with 
AD. We hypothesized that a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on tau PET (tau PRS) 
would capture the aggregate inherited susceptibility/resistance architecture 
influencing tau accumulation, beyond solely the measurement of amyloid-β burden. 
Leveraging rich multimodal data from a population-based sample of older adults, 
we found that this novel tau PRS was a strong surrogate of tau PET deposition 
and captured a significant proportion of the variance in tau PET levels as 
compared with amyloid PET burden, APOE (apolipoprotein E) ε4 (the most common 
risk allele for AD), and a non-APOE PRS of clinical case-control AD risk 
variants. In independent validation samples, the tau PRS was associated with 
cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau levels in one cohort and with postmortem 
Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage in another. We also observed an association 
of the tau PRS with longitudinal cognitive trajectories, including a statistical 
interaction of the tau PRS with amyloid burden on cognitive decline. Although 
additional study is warranted, these findings demonstrate the potential utility 
of a tau PRS for capturing the collective genetic background influencing tau 
deposition in the general population. In the future, a tau PRS could be 
leveraged for cost-effective screening and risk stratification to guide trial 
enrollment and clinical interventions in AD.
