BACKGROUND: Currently, chromosomal microarrays (CMA) are recommended as 
first-tier test in the investigation of developmental disorders to examine copy 
number variations. The modern platforms also include probes for single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that detect homozygous regions in the genome, 
such as long contiguous stretches of homozygosity (LCSH) also named runs of 
homozygosity (ROH). LCHS are chromosomal segments resulting from complete or 
segmental chromosomal homozygosity, which may be indicative of uniparental 
disomy (UPD), consanguinity, as well as replicative DNA repair events, however 
also are common findings in normal populations. Knowing common LCSH of a 
population, which probably represent ancestral haplotypes of low-recombination 
regions in the genome, facilitates the interpretation of LCSH found in patients, 
allowing to prioritize those with possible clinical significance. However, 
population records of ancestral haplotype derived LCSH by SNP arrays are still 
scarce, particularly for countries such as Brazil where even for the clinic, 
microarrays that include SNPs are difficult to request due to their high cost.
METHODS: In this study, we evaluate the frequencies and implications of LCSH 
detected by Affymetrix CytoScan® HD or 750 K platforms in 430 patients with 
neurodevelopmental disorders in southern Brazil. LCSH were analyzed in the 
context of pathogenic significance and also explored to identify ancestral 
haplotype derived LCSH. The criteria for considering a region as LCSH was 
homozygosis ≥3 Mbp on an autosome.
RESULTS: In 95% of the patients, at least one LCSH was detected, a total of 1478 
LCSH in 407 patients. In 2.6%, the findings were suggestive of UPD. For about 
8.5% LCSH suggest offspring from first to fifth grade, more likely to have a 
clinical impact. Considering recurrent LCSH found at a frequency of 5% or more, 
we outline 11 regions as potentially representing ancestral haplotypes in our 
population. The region most involved with homozygosity was 16p11.2p11.1 (49%), 
followed by 1q21.2q21.3 (21%), 11p11.2p11.12 (19%), 3p21.31p21.2 (16%), 15q15 
1q33p32.3 (12%), 2q11.1q12.1 (9%), 1p33p32.3 (6%), 20q11.21q11.23 (6%), 
10q22.1q23.31 (5%), 6p22.2p22 (5%), and 7q11.22q11.23 (5%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we show the importance and usefulness of interpreting 
LCSH in the results of CMA wich incorporate SNPs.
