BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic 
dermatitis (AD), affect a large proportion of people worldwide. Both have 
environmental and genetic predisposing factors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in interleukin (IL)-18, may play a direct role in the disease 
pathogenesis. This study was designed to investigate the association of the 
IL-18 gene SNPs (-137 G/C [rs187238], and -140 C/G [rs360721]) with AR and AD, 
as well as their relations to the diseases' severity.
METHODS: Seventy-five individuals were enrolled in the study including, 25 AD 
children, 25 AR patients, and 25 unrelated healthy adult volunteers who served 
as controls. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction and 
restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
RESULTS: AR and AD patients showed no significant differences in the genotype 
distribution and allele frequencies of -137 G/C and -140 C/G SNPs when compared 
independently with the control group. However, the -140 GG genotype and the -140 
G allele were more often associated with severe AD compared with mild and 
moderate phenotypes (p = 0.01 and 0.001, respectively; odds ratios [ORs], 14.25 
[95% CI, 1.48-143.2] and 16 [95% CI, 2.8-90.46], respectively). Moreover, the 
-137 G allele was associated with moderate/severe AR (p = 0.019; OR, 6.1 [95% 
CI, 1.34-28.1]).
CONCLUSION: This preliminary study indicates that the studied polymorphisms do 
not confer susceptibility to allergy in Egyptian patients but may be related to 
the disease phenotype. However, the role of IL-18 in allergy may be too complex 
to be reflected in a simple association study.
