Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disease characterized by 
hyperglycaemia. T2DM is a highly heterogeneous polygenic disease. Due to genetic 
variation, variations in lifestyle and other environmental exposures, there are 
certain variations in the phenotype of T2DM patients. Sodium glucose 
cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are novel hypoglycaemic agents that increase 
urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal 
tubules of the kidney. For glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and 
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, studies have confirmed a variety of gene 
variants that may modify their effects. For SGLT2 inhibitors, research has 
focused on the SLC5A2 gene encoding SGLT2 and UGT1A9 gene polymorphisms 
affecting SGLT2 inhibitor metabolism. The SLC5A2 polymorphism rs9934336 have 
been associated with decreased HbA1c during the oral glucose tolerance test. 
Common variants of the SLC5A2 gene are related to blood glucose and insulin 
concentrations, but not glucagon concentrations. SLC5A2 rs9934336 and rs3116150 
are related to a lower risk of heart failure. SGLT2 inhibitor exposure of 
UGT1A9*3 carriers is commonly higher than that of noncarriers, while these 
effects commonly have no obvious clinical significance on SGLT2 inhibitor 
pharmacokinetics. In terms of efficacy, general SLC5A2 variants show no 
significant effect on the response to the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin. At 
present, research on the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and the 
efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors is limited. The main purpose of this review is to 
elucidate the general effects of SGLT2 polymorphisms and the association between 
polymorphisms and the treatment response to SGLT2 inhibitors.
