The large cytosolic GTPase, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), mediates both 
physiological and pathological mitochondrial fission. Cell stress triggers Drp1 
binding to mitochondrial Fis1 and subsequently, mitochondrial fragmentation, ROS 
production, metabolic collapse, and cell death. Because Drp1 also mediates 
physiological fission by binding to mitochondrial Mff, therapeutics that inhibit 
pathological fission should spare physiological mitochondrial fission. P110, a 
peptide inhibitor of Drp1-Fis1 interaction, reduces pathology in numerous models 
of neurodegeneration, ischemia, and sepsis without blocking the physiological 
functions of Drp1. Since peptides have pharmacokinetic limitations, we set out 
to identify small molecules that mimic P110's benefit. We map the P110-binding 
site to a switch I-adjacent grove (SWAG) on Drp1. Screening for SWAG-binding 
small molecules identifies SC9, which mimics P110's benefits in cells and a 
mouse model of endotoxemia. We suggest that the SWAG-binding small molecules 
discovered in this study may reduce the burden of Drp1-mediated pathologies and 
potentially pathologies associated with other members of the GTPase family.
