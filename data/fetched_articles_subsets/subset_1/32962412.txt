BACKGROUND: Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play significant roles in atherosclerosis 
via phenotypic switching, a pathological process in which SMC dedifferentiation, 
migration, and transdifferentiation into other cell types. Yet how SMCs 
contribute to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis remains elusive.
METHODS: To reveal the trajectories of SMC transdifferentiation during 
atherosclerosis and to identify molecular targets for disease therapy, we 
combined SMC fate mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing of both mouse and human 
atherosclerotic plaques. We also performed cell biology experiments on isolated 
SMC-derived cells, conducted integrative human genomics, and used 
pharmacological studies targeting SMC-derived cells both in vivo and in vitro.
RESULTS: We found that SMCs transitioned to an intermediate cell state during 
atherosclerosis, which was also found in human atherosclerotic plaques of 
carotid and coronary arteries. SMC-derived intermediate cells, termed "SEM" 
cells (stem cell, endothelial cell, monocyte), were multipotent and could 
differentiate into macrophage-like and fibrochondrocyte-like cells, as well as 
return toward the SMC phenotype. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling was identified as 
a regulator of SMC to SEM cell transition, and RA signaling was dysregulated in 
symptomatic human atherosclerosis. Human genomics revealed enrichment of 
genome-wide association study signals for coronary artery disease in RA 
signaling target gene loci and correlation between coronary artery disease risk 
alleles and repressed expression of these genes. Activation of RA signaling by 
all-trans RA, an anticancer drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia, blocked SMC 
transition to SEM cells, reduced atherosclerotic burden, and promoted fibrous 
cap stability.
CONCLUSIONS: Integration of cell-specific fate mapping, single-cell genomics, 
and human genetics adds novel insights into the complexity of SMC biology and 
reveals regulatory pathways for therapeutic targeting of SMC transitions in 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
