Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is a rare genetic disease that is mostly inherited 
as an autosomal dominant trait. It is associated predominantly with mutations in 
desmosomal genes and is characterized by the replacement of the ventricular 
myocardium with fibrous fatty deposits, arrhythmias and a high risk of sudden 
death. In vitro studies have contributed to our understanding of the pathogenic 
mechanisms underlying this disease, including its genetic determinants, as well 
as its cellular, signaling and molecular defects. Here, we review what is 
currently known about the pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and 
focus on the in vitro models that have advanced our understanding of the 
disease. Finally, we assess the potential of established and innovative cell 
platforms for elucidating unknown aspects of this disease, and for screening new 
potential therapeutic agents. This appraisal of in vitro models of 
arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy highlights the discoveries made about this disease 
and the uses of these models for future basic and therapeutic research.
