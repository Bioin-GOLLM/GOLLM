Numerous studies have evaluated the association between the X-ray repair 
cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) DNA repair gene polymorphism -77T>C and lung 
cancer risk. However, this association is controversial. We used PubMed and 
Embase to identify 5 case-control studies, which included 2488 lung cancer cases 
and 2576 controls, for inclusion in a comprehensive meta-analysis in order to 
assess this association. Two independent reviewers extracted data from the 
studies, and ORs with 95%CIs were calculated. When all studies were pooled, we 
found a significant association between the -77T>C polymorphism and lung cancer 
risk (TT vs CC: OR = 0.52, 95%CI = 0.34-0.80, P = 0.49; TT vs CT: OR = 0.71, 
95%CI = 0.62-0.81, P = 0.69; dominant model: OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.27-1.66, P = 
0.64; recessive model: OR = 0.54, 95%CI = 0.36-0.82, P = 0.24). In a subgroup 
analysis of nationalities, the -77T>C polymorphism was significantly associated 
with lung cancer risk in Asian patients. In conclusion, the XRCC1 -77T>C 
polymorphism might be related to increased risk of lung cancer in Asians. Future 
studies are needed for conclusive evidence about this association.
