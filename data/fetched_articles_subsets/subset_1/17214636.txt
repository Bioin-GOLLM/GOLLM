BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It has been proposed that genotypes reflective of 
polymorphisms in cytokine genes can predispose individuals to disease by 
enhancing inflammatory processes. The C/T polymorphism at position -889 of the 
IL1A gene influences interleukin-1alpha expression, with the T allele inducing 
higher expression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the 
IL1A (-889) gene polymorphism in Brazilian individuals with different clinical 
forms of periodontitis and severity of disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: DNA was obtained from oral swabs of 163 Brazilian 
individuals and was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
Products were submitted to digestion and were analyzed by electrophoresis to 
distinguish the C and T alleles.
RESULTS: A significant difference in the genotype distribution was observed when 
comparing the chronic periodontitis group with the control group, evaluating 
only nonsmokers (chi-squared analysis = 9.91; p = 0.007), as well as when 
smokers were included (chi-squared analysis = 6.36; p = 0.04). Moreover, we 
observed a higher incidence of the T allele in the chronic periodontitis group 
(37.8%) when compared with the control group (18.4%) in nonsmokers (p = 0.006, 
odds ratio = 2.69, confidence interval = 1.27-5.68) and also when smokers were 
included (p = 0.03, odds ratio = 1.87, confidence interval = 0.98-3.56). No 
statistical difference was observed when the aggressive periodontitis group was 
compared with the control group. With regard to severity of disease, no 
statistical difference was observed.
CONCLUSION: These data show an association of the IL1A (-889) polymorphism with 
chronic periodontitis in Brazilian individuals.
