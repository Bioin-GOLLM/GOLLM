Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized 
by the occurrence of visceral and neurological symptoms. At present, the 
molecular mechanisms causing neurodegeneration in this disease are unknown. Here 
we report the altered expression and/or mislocalization of the TAR-DNA binding 
protein 43 (TDP-43) in both NPC mouse and in a human neuronal model of the 
disease. We also report the neuropathologic study of a NPC patient's brain, 
showing that while TDP-43 is below immunohistochemical detection in nuclei of 
cerebellar Purkinje cells, it has a predominant localization in the cytoplasm of 
these cells. From a functional point of view, the TDP-43 mislocalization, that 
occurs in a human experimental neuronal model system, is associated with 
specific alterations in TDP-43 controlled genes. Most interestingly, treatment 
with N-Acetyl-cysteine (NAC) or beta-cyclodextrin (CD) can partially restore 
TDP-43 nuclear localization. Taken together, the results of these studies extend 
the role of TDP-43 beyond the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD)/Alzheimer disease (AD) spectrum. These findings may open novel 
research/therapeutic avenues for a better understanding of both NPC disease and 
the TDP-43 proteinopathy disease mechanism.
