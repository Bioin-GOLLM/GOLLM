Abnormal energy metabolism, including enhanced aerobic glycolysis and lipid 
synthesis, is a well-established feature of glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Thus, 
targeting the cellular glycolipid metabolism can be a feasible therapeutic 
strategy for GBM. This study aimed to evaluate the roles of MSI2, SNORD12B, and 
ZBTB4 in regulating the glycolipid metabolism and proliferation of GBM cells. 
MSI2 and SNORD12B expression was significantly upregulated and ZBTB4 expression 
was significantly low in GBM tissues and cells. Knockdown of MSI2 or SNORD12B or 
overexpression of ZBTB4 inhibited GBM cell glycolipid metabolism and 
proliferation. MSI2 may improve SNORD12B expression by increasing its stability. 
Importantly, SNORD12B increased utilization of the ZBTB4 mRNA transcript distal 
polyadenylation signal in alternative polyadenylation processing by 
competitively combining with FIP1L1, which decreased ZBTB4 expression because of 
the increased proportion of the 3' untranslated region long transcript. ZBTB4 
transcriptionally suppressed the expression of HK2 and ACLY by binding directly 
to the promoter regions. Additionally, ZBTB4 bound the MSI promoter region to 
transcriptionally suppress MSI2 expression, thereby forming an 
MSI2/SNORD12B/FIP1L1/ZBTB4 feedback loop to regulate the glycolipid metabolism 
and proliferation of GBM cells. In conclusion, MSI2 increased the stability of 
SNORD12B, which regulated ZBTB4 alternative polyadenylation processing by 
competitively binding to FIP1L1. Thus, the MSI2/SNORD12B/FIP1L1/ZBTB4 positive 
feedback loop plays a crucial role in regulating the glycolipid metabolism of 
GBM cells and provides a potential drug target for glioma treatment.
