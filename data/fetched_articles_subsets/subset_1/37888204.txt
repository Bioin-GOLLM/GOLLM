BACKGROUND: Long intergenic non-coding RNA, is one type of lncRNA, exerting 
various cellular activities, as does ncRNA, including the regulation of gene 
expression and chromatin remodeling. The abnormal expression of lincRNAs can 
induce or suppress carcinogenesis.
MAIN BODY: LincRNAs can regulate cancer progression through different mechanisms 
and are considered as potential drug targets. Genetic variations such as single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lincRNAs may affect gene expression and 
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) stability. SNPs in lincRNAs have been found to 
be associated with different types of cancer, as well. Specifically, LINC00511 
has been known to promote the progression of multiple malignancies such as 
breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and 
others, making it a promising cancer prognostic molecular marker.
CONCLUSION: LincRNAs have been proved to be associated with different cancer 
types through various pathways. Herein, we performed a comprehensive literature 
and in silico databases search listing lncRNAs, lincRNAs including LINC00511, 
lncRNAs' SNPs, as well as LINC00511 SNPs in different cancer types, focusing on 
their role in various cancer types and mechanism(s) of action.
