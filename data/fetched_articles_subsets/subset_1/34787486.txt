Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests are a critical component for the early 
diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and of 
the overall control strategy for the current pandemic. Nucleic acid 
amplification tests are the gold standard for diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 
infection, and many real-time PCR diagnostic assays have been developed. 
Mutations that occur within the primer/probe binding regions of the SARS-CoV-2 
genome can negatively impact the performance of diagnostic assays. Here, we 
report two single-point mutations in the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 associated with N 
gene target detection failures in the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, the 
first a C to T mutation at position 29197, found in five patients, and the 
second a C to T mutation at position 29200, found in eight patients. By 
sequencing the Xpert amplicons, we showed both mutations to be located within 
the amplified region of the Xpert N gene target. This report highlights the 
necessity for multiple genetic targets and the continual monitoring and 
evaluation of diagnostic assay performance. IMPORTANCE This paper reports the 
identification of single-point mutations in the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 associated 
with a gene target failure by the Cepheid Xpert commercial system. In order to 
determine the mutation(s) responsible for the N gene detection failures, the 
genomic products from the Cepheid Xpert system were sequenced and compared to 
whole genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical cases. This report is the first to our 
knowledge which characterizes the amplified PCR products of the Xpert system, 
confirming the mutations associated with the gene target failure. The mutations 
identified have previously been reported.
