Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ORF30-33 locus encodes four genes with 
unknown functions. We performed transcriptional mapping of these genes. 
Northern-hybridization, 5'- and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and DNA 
sequencing identified four transcripts of 3.7, 3.6, 2.7, and 1.4 kb, none of 
which has alternative splicing. While all transcripts have the same termination 
site, their start sites vary. All transcripts are not expressed or only weakly 
expressed in latent cells but can be chemically induced. The 3.7 and 3.6 kb 
transcripts contain all four genes and are sensitive to cycloheximide (CH) but 
resistant to phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), indicating that they are early lytic 
transcripts. The 2.7 kb transcript contains ORF32 and ORF33 genes while the 1.4 
kb transcript contains the ORF33 gene. Both transcripts are sensitive to CH and 
PAA, indicating that they are late lytic transcripts. Furthermore, we identified 
four promoters with functional TATA boxes, none of which is directly 
transactivated by RTA. Examination of the 5' untranslated region of ORF31 failed 
to identify any functional internal ribosome entry sites. These results define 
the transcriptional patterns of the ORF30-33 locus, which should help the 
delineation of its function.
