To study mechanisms underlying resistance to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax in 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we used a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to 
identify gene knockouts resulting in drug resistance. We validated TP53, BAX, 
and PMAIP1 as genes whose inactivation results in venetoclax resistance in AML 
cell lines. Resistance to venetoclax resulted from an inability to execute 
apoptosis driven by BAX loss, decreased expression of BCL2, and/or reliance on 
alternative BCL2 family members such as BCL2L1. The resistance was accompanied 
by changes in mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular metabolism. Evaluation of 
TP53 knockout cells for sensitivities to a panel of small-molecule inhibitors 
revealed a gain of sensitivity to TRK inhibitors. We relate these observations 
to patient drug responses and gene expression in the Beat AML dataset. Our 
results implicate TP53, the apoptotic network, and mitochondrial functionality 
as drivers of venetoclax response in AML and suggest strategies to overcome 
resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: AML is challenging to treat due to its heterogeneity, 
and single-agent therapies have universally failed, prompting a need for 
innovative drug combinations. We used a genetic approach to identify genes whose 
inactivation contributes to drug resistance as a means of forming preferred drug 
combinations to improve AML treatment.See related commentary by Savona and
