BACKGROUND: Caspase-3, a principal apoptotic effector that cleaves the majority 
of cellular substrates, is an important medicinal target for the treatment of 
cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Large amounts of the protein are 
required for drug discovery research. However, previous efforts to express the 
full-length caspase-3 gene in E. coli have been unsuccessful.
RESULTS: Overproducers of thrombin-activatable full-length caspase-3 precursors 
were prepared by engineering the auto-activation sites of caspase-3 precursor 
into a sequence susceptible to thrombin hydrolysis. The engineered precursors 
were highly expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli and easily purified by 
affinity chromatography, to levels of 10-15 mg from 1 L of E. coli culture, and 
readily activated by thrombin digestion. Kinetic evaluation disclosed that 
thrombin digestion enhanced catalytic activity (kcat/KM) of the precursor 
proteins by two orders of magnitude.
CONCLUSION: A novel method for a large-scale preparation of active caspase-3 was 
developed by a strategic engineering to lack auto-activation during expression 
with amino acid sequences susceptible to thrombin, facilitating high-level 
expression in E. coli. The precursor protein was easily purified and activated 
through specific cleavage at the engineered sites by thrombin, generating active 
caspase-3 in high yields.
