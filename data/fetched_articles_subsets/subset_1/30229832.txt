OBJECTIVE: PTENP1, a long noncoding RNA, has previously been reported to be 
involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The relationship between 
PTENP1 and susceptibility tumors is reported, while, an association of PTENP1 
with the risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in Chinese population is 
lacked. This research is designed to investigate the association of PTENP1 with 
susceptibility of OSCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this research, TaqMan technology was used to test 
genotype in 342 OSCC patients and 711 healthy controls, so as to analyze the 
association between PTENP1 polymorphisms (rs7853346 rs865005 and rs10971638) and 
susceptibility of oral squamous cell carcinoma.
RESULTS: The results of this research showed that rs7853346 [Additive model: 
Adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.66-0.99] was 
related to the OSCC risk. It was not found that the other two sites were 
associated with the susceptibility of OSCC.
CONCLUSIONS: This research indicated that rs7853346 is statistically correlated 
with the OSCC risk.
