PURPOSE: Activation of the innate immune system and chronic low-grade 
inflammation are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis 
and also thought to be associated with type 2 diabetes and its complications. As 
a receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide and heat-shock proteins, Toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4) is one of the central regulators of the immune response. 
Recent studies have reported an association between TLR4 polymorphisms and 
diabetes and its complications in Caucasian populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the association between TLR4 
gene polymorphisms in patients with features of type 2 diabetes and healthy 
controls in Korea. Two polymorphisms of the TLR4 gene (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) 
were examined in 225 diabetic patients and 153 healthy controls using polymerase 
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and 
single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP).
RESULTS: No Asp299Gly or Thr399Ile mutations were detected in any of the 378 
subjects. Seven subjects from each group who had slightly different SSCP 
patterns were selected for sequencing, but we found no TLR4 polymorphisms on 
Exon3. The Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile TLR4 gene polymorphisms were absent in both 
groups, which was similar to the results for Japanese and Chinese Han subjects.
CONCLUSION: Our data and other Asian data suggest that a racial difference can 
be found in the frequency of the TLR4 polymorphism.
