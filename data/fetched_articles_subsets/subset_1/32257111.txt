BACKGROUND: Exocytosis is a process by which vesicles are transported to and 
fused with specific areas of the plasma membrane. Although several studies have 
shown that sphingolipids are the main components of exocytic compartments, 
whether they control exocytosis process is unclear.
RESULTS: Here, we have investigated the role of sphingolipids in exocytosis by 
reducing the activity of the serine palmitoyl-transferase (SPT), which catalyzes 
the first step in sphingolipid synthesis in endoplasmic reticulum. We found that 
the exocyst polarity and exocytic secretion were impaired in lcb1-100 mutant 
cells and in wild type cells treated with myriocin, a chemical which can 
specifically inhibit SPT enzyme activity, suggesting that sphingolipids controls 
exocytic secretion. This speculation was further confirmed by 
immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy results that small secretory 
vesicles were accumulated in lcb1-100 mutant cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that sphingolipids are required 
for exocytosis. Mammals may use similar regulatory mechanisms because components 
of the exocytic secretion apparatus and signaling pathways are conserved.
