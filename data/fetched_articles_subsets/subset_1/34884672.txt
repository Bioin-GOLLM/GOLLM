ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) rearrangements are reported in about 1-2% of 
non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). After efficacy of crizotinib 
was demonstrated, identification of ROS1 translocations in advanced disease 
became fundamental to give patients the chance of specific and effective 
treatment. Different methods are available for detection of rearrangements, and 
probably the real prevalence of ROS1 rearrangements is higher than that reported 
in literature, as our capacity to detect gene rearrangements is improving. In 
particular, with next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, we are currently 
able to assess multiple genes simultaneously with increasing sensitivity. This 
is leading to overcome the "single oncogenic driver" paradigm, and in the very 
near future, the co-existence of multiple drivers will probably emerge more 
frequently and represent a therapeutic issue. Since recently, crizotinib has 
been the only available therapy, but today, many other tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKI) are emerging and seem promising both in first and subsequent 
lines of treatment. Indeed, novel inhibitors are also able to overcome 
resistance mutations to crizotinib, hypothesizing a possible sequential strategy 
also in ROS1-rearranged disease. In this review, we will focus on ROS1 
rearrangements, dealing with diagnostic aspects, new therapeutic options, 
resistance issues and the coexistence of ROS1 translocations with other 
molecular alterations.
