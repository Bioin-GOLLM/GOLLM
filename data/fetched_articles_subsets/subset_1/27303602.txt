Many studies indicate that oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology 
of neurodegenerative diseases. Oxidative stress can induce neuronal damages, 
modulate intracellular signaling and ultimately leads to neuronal death by 
apoptosis or necrosis. To review antioxidants preventive effects on oxidative 
stress and neurodegenerative diseases we accumulated data from international 
medical journals and academic informations' sites. According to many studies, 
antioxidants could reduce toxic neuronal damages and many studies confirmed the 
efficacy of polyphenol antioxidants in fruits and vegetables to reduce neuronal 
death and to diminish oxidative stress. This systematic review showed the 
antioxidant activities of phytochemicals which play as natural neuroprotectives 
with low adverse effects against some neurodegenerative diseases as Parkinson or 
Alzheimer diseases.
