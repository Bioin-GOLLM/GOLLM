Nimorazole belongs to the imidazole-based family of antibiotics to fight against 
anaerobic bacteria. Moreover, nimorazole is now in Phase 3 clinical trial in 
Europe for potential use as a hypoxia radiosensitizer for treatment of head and 
neck cancers. We envision the use of [15 N3 ]nimorazole as a theragnostic 
hypoxia contrast agent that can be potentially deployed in the next-generation 
MRI-LINAC systems. Herein, we report the first steps to create long-lasting (for 
tens of minutes) hyperpolarized state on three 15 N sites of [15 N3 ]nimorazole 
with T1 of up to ca. 6 minutes. The nuclear spin polarization was boosted by ca. 
67000-fold at 1.4 T (corresponding to P15N of 3.2 %) by 15 N-15 N spin-relayed 
SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization technique, relying on simultaneous exchange of 
[15 N3 ]nimorazole and parahydrogen on polarization transfer Ir-IMes catalyst. 
The presented results pave the way to efficient spin-relayed SABRE-SHEATH 
hyperpolarization of a wide range of imidazole-based antibiotics and 
chemotherapeutics.
