Clearance of acute infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is associated with the 
chr19q13.13 region containing the rs368234815 (TT/ΔG) polymorphism. We 
fine-mapped this region to detect possible causal variants that may contribute 
to HCV clearance. First, we performed sequencing of IFNL1-IFNL4 region in 64 
individuals sampled according to rs368234815 genotype: TT/clearance (N = 16) and 
ΔG/persistent (N = 15) (genotype-outcome concordant) or TT/persistent (N = 19) 
and ΔG/clearance (N = 14) (discordant). 25 SNPs had a difference in counts of 
alternative allele >5 between clearance and persistence individuals. Then, we 
evaluated those markers in an association analysis of HCV clearance conditioning 
on rs368234815 in two groups of European (692 clearance/1 025 persistence) and 
African ancestry (320 clearance/1 515 persistence) individuals. 10/25 variants 
were associated (P < 0.05) in the conditioned analysis leaded by rs4803221 
(P value = 4.9 × 10-04) and rs8099917 (P value = 5.5 × 10-04). In the European 
ancestry group, individuals with the haplotype rs368234815ΔG/rs4803221C were 
1.7× more likely to clear than those with the rs368234815ΔG/rs4803221G haplotype 
(P value = 3.6 × 10-05). For another nearby SNP, the haplotype of 
rs368234815ΔG/rs8099917T was associated with HCV clearance compared to 
rs368234815ΔG/rs8099917G (OR: 1.6, P value = 1.8 × 10-04). We identified four 
possible causal variants: rs368234815, rs12982533, rs10612351 and rs4803221. Our 
results suggest a main signal of association represented by rs368234815, with 
contributions from rs4803221, and/or nearby SNPs including rs8099917.
