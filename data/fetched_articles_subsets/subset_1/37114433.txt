Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve 
after its emergence. Given its importance in viral infection and vaccine 
development, mutations in the viral Spike gene have been studied extensively; 
however, the impact of mutations outside the Spike gene are poorly understood. 
Here, we report that a triple deletion (ΔSGF or ΔLSG) in nonstructural protein 6 
(nsp6) independently acquired in Alpha and Omicron sublineages of SARS-CoV-2 
augments nsp6-mediated antagonism of type-I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. 
Specifically, these triple deletions enhance the ability of mutant nsp6 to 
suppress phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. A parental SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 
strain containing the nsp6 ΔSGF deletion (ΔSGF-WA1) shows reduced susceptibility 
to IFN-I treatment in vitro, outcompetes the parental strain in human primary 
airway cultures, and increases virulence in mice; however, the ΔSGF-WA1 virus is 
less virulent than the Alpha variant (which has the nsp6 ΔSGF deletion and 
additional mutations in other genes). Analyses of host responses from 
ΔSGF-WA1-infected mice and primary airway cultures reveal activation of pathways 
indicative of a cytokine storm. These results provide evidence that mutations 
outside the Spike protein affect virus-host interactions and may alter 
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 variants in humans.
