The aim of this systematic review is to compare home and office desensitizers 
containing bioactive glass with control groups in randomized controlled trials 
(RCT) conducted between 2018 and 2022. According to PRISMA guidelines, three 
electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane Library) were searched for 
published scientific articles in October 2022. RCT with adult participants with 
dentin hypersensitivity (DH) diagnosed by evaporative, mechanical, or thermal 
stimulation, with a follow-up period and quantified pain assessment were 
included in the study. Studies that reported DH due to tooth restoration, crown 
preparation, bleaching, or periodontal surgery or used bioactive glass-ceramics 
were excluded. The quality of the studies was assessed using version 2 of the 
Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for randomized studies (RoB 2 tool). Articles that 
were duplicative or unrelated to this study were excluded. Nine articles were 
selected for full-text evaluation, whereas two articles were rejected. The 
remaining seven reports were included in this review. The calcium sodium 
phosphosilicate group (CSPS) was not significantly different from the positive 
control groups. Compared with the control groups, fluoro calcium phosphosilicate 
(FCPS) may be the most effective long-term treatment option. In terms of DH 
symptom reduction, the FCPS group performed better than the CSPS group. CSPS at 
a concentration of 5-15% and FCPS at a concentration of 5% are effective in 
treating DH in adult participants.
