PURPOSE: To explore the regulatory effects of liraglutide on the kidney and 
liver through the miR-34a/SIRT1 pathway with related factors in diabetic 
nephropathy (DN) rats.
METHODS: DN rats were randomly divided into two groups (n = 10) and were 
injected with liraglutide or normal saline twice a day. The 24-hour urine 
microalbumin content and biochemical index levels were measured. qRT-PCR was 
performed to detect the expression of miR-34a in the kidney and liver tissues. 
The levels of SIRT1, HIF-1a, Egr-1, and TGF-β1 in kidney and liver tissues were 
determined using qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Electron 
microscopy and HE staining were used to observe the ultrastructure and 
pathological changes.
RESULTS: Liraglutide treatment in DN rats decreased blood glucose, 24-hour urine 
microalbumin, TC, TG, LDL-C, UA, Cr, UREA, ALT, and AST levels and increased the 
level of HDL-C (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the miR-34a levels 
were significantly decreased in kidney and liver tissues followed by liraglutide 
treatment (P < 0.05). The levels of SIRT1 in the liraglutide group are 
significantly higher than those in the control group with the kidney and liver 
tissues (P < 0.05). Conversely, the contents of HIF-1a, Egr-1, and TGF-β1 were 
significantly lower in the liraglutide group than in the control group (P < 
0.05). Electron microscopy showed that the kidney of the liraglutide-treated 
group exhibited minor broadening of the mesangial areas, fewer deposits, and a 
well-organized foot process. HE staining revealed that the kidney of the 
liraglutide-treated rats had a more regular morphology of the glomerulus and 
Bowman sac cavity and lighter tubular edema. Additionally, the 
liraglutide-treated DN rats had a clear hepatic structure, a lower degree of 
steatosis, and mild inflammatory cell infiltration.
CONCLUSION: Liraglutide, through its effect on the miR-34a/SIRT1 pathway, may 
have a protective role in the kidney and liver of DN rats.
