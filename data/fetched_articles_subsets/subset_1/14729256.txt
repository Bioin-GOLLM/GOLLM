A recent study demonstrated that the tenascin X (TNXB) gene was associated with 
schizophrenia in a British population. To replicate the initial finding, we 
analysed two positive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1009382 and 
rs204887 present at the TNXB locus, in a Chinese population by using PCR-based 
restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. We recruited a total of 136 
family trios consisting of fathers, mothers and affected offspring with 
schizophrenia. The transmission disequilibrium test did not show allelic 
association between these two SNPs and schizophrenia, and the rs1009382-rs204887 
haplotypes were not associated with the illness either. The present results 
suggest that the TNXB locus does not appear to be associated with schizophrenia 
in the Chinese population. Because the TNXB gene is less than 100 kb away from 
the NOTCH4 locus that was also reported to be associated with schizophrenia, 
allelic and locus heterogeneity could be possible reasons for the failure to 
replicate the TNXB finding.
