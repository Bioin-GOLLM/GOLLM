The phasor method of treating fluorescence lifetime data provides a facile and 
convenient approach to characterize lifetime heterogeneity and to detect the 
presence of excited state reactions such as solvent relaxation and Förster 
resonance energy transfer. The method uses a plot of M sin(Φ) versus M cos(Φ), 
where M is the modulation ratio and Φ is the phase angle taken from frequency 
domain fluorometry. A principal advantage of the phasor method is that it 
provides a model-less approach to time-resolved data amenable to visual 
inspection. Although the phasor approach has been recently applied to 
fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, it has not been used extensively for 
cuvette studies. In the current study, we explore the applications of the method 
to in vitro samples. The phasors of binary and ternary mixtures of fluorescent 
dyes demonstrate the utility of the method for investigating complex mixtures. 
Data from excited state reactions, such as dipolar relaxation in membrane and 
protein systems and also energy transfer from the tryptophan residue to the 
chromophore in enhanced green fluorescent protein, are also presented.
