Now 15-year-old girl with glycogen storage disease (GSD) type IIIa (OMIM 232400) 
developed severe left ventricular obstructive hypertrophy and hepatomegaly while 
treated with frequent cornstarch meals. Subsequently, she was introduced the 
ketogenic diet; continuous ketosis has been maintained for over the last 
4 years. After the introduction of ketogenic diet, a normalization of the 
cardiomyopathy and improvement of hepatopathy was achieved, with enhanced 
overall quality of life.
