Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease. We 
aimed to measure the level of miR-155 and its genetic variant rs767649 in 
patients with RA and to evaluate their relationship with ischemia-modified 
albumin (IMA). The study was performed on 79 patients with RA (group I) and 78 
healthy control participants (group II). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction was used to assess the expression of serum miR-155 in addition to its 
functional variant rs767649. IMA levels were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. Significant overexpression of miR-155 and higher levels of 
IMA were detected in patients with RA compared with those in controls 
(P < 0.0001). The fold change in miR-155 was significantly positively associated 
with IMA (r = 0.362, P = 0.001) in patients with RA. Significant differences in 
the frequency of miR-155 (rs767649) genotypes and alleles were noted between 
patients with RA and controls. MiR-155 and IMA levels were significantly 
associated with the genotype distribution of miR-155 (rs767649) in patients with 
RA and were higher in patients with the TT genotype. MiR-155 and its functional 
variant rs767649 might play an important role in susceptibility to the increased 
risk of RA, stressing the role of miR-155 as a therapeutic target in the 
treatment of RA. In addition, IMA levels were increased and correlated with 
miR-155 and its single nucleotide polymorphism rs767649 in Egyptian patients 
with RA.
