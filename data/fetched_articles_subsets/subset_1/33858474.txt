Despite complete surgical resection brain metastases are at significant risk of 
local recurrence without additional radiation therapy. Traditionally, the 
addition of postoperative whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has been considered 
the standard of care on the basis of randomized studies demonstrating its 
efficacy in reducing the risk of recurrence in the surgical bed as well as the 
incidence of new distant metastases. More recently, postoperative stereotactic 
radiosurgery (SRS) to the surgical bed has emerged as an effective and safe 
treatment option for resected brain metastases. Published randomized trials have 
demonstrated that postoperative SRS to the resection cavity provides superior 
local control compared to surgery alone, and significantly decreases the risk of 
neurocognitive decline compared to WBRT, without detrimental effects on 
survival. While studies support the use of postoperative SRS to the resection 
cavity as the standard of care after surgery, there are several issues that need 
to be investigated further with the aim of improving local control and reducing 
the risk of leptomeningeal disease and radiation necrosis, including the optimal 
dose prescription/fractionation, the timing of postoperative SRS treatment, and 
surgical cavity target delineation. We provide a clinical overview on current 
status and recent advances in resection cavity irradiation of brain metastases, 
focusing on relevant strategies that can improve local control and minimize the 
risk of radiation-induced toxicity.
