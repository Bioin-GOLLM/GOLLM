The title compound, (C6H14N)2[Sn(C6H5)2Cl4], contains cyclo-hexyl-ammonium 
cations in general positions and a stannate(IV) anion that is located on a 
twofold rotation axis. The Sn(IV) atom in the complex anion is surrounded by 
four Cl(-) ligands and two trans-phenyl groups in a distorted octa-hedral 
configuration. The anions are connected with the cations through N-H⋯Cl hydrogen 
bonds. Every cation is involved in three N-H⋯Cl bonds to the chloride ligands of 
three different anions, and each chloride ligand is linked to two cations. This 
arrangement leads to a layered structure parallel to (010).
