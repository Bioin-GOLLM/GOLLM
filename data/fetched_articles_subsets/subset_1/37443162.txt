Deformable semi-solid liquid metal particles (LMP) have emerged as a promising 
substitute for rigid conductive fillers due to their excellent electrical 
properties and stable conductance under strain. However, achieving a compact and 
robust coating of LMP on fibers remains a persistent challenge, mainly due to 
the incompatibility of conventional coating techniques with LMP. Additionally, 
the limited durability and absence of initial electrical conductivity of LMP 
restrict their widespread application. In this study, we propose a solution 
process that robustly and compactly assembles mechanically durable and initially 
conductive LMP on fibers. Specifically, we present a shearing-based deposition 
of polymer-attached LMP followed by additional coating with CNT-attached LMP to 
create bi-layer LMP composite with exceptional durability, electrical 
conductivity, stretchability, and biocompatibility on various fibers. The 
versatility and reliability of this manufacturing strategy for 1D electronics 
are demonstrated through the development of sewn electrical circuits, smart 
clothes, stretchable biointerfaced fiber, and multifunctional fiber probes.
