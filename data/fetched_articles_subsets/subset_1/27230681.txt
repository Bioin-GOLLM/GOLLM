Inhibition of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin increases bone mass in patients with 
osteoporosis and in preclinical animal models. Here we show increased levels of 
the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) in animals treated with sclerostin 
antibody, suggesting a negative feedback mechanism that limits Wnt-driven bone 
formation. To test our hypothesis that co-inhibition of both factors further 
increases bone mass, we engineer a first-in-class bispecific antibody with 
single residue pair mutations in the Fab region to promote efficient and stable 
cognate light-heavy chain pairing. We demonstrate that dual inhibition of 
sclerostin and DKK-1 leads to synergistic bone formation in rodents and 
non-human primates. Furthermore, by targeting distinct facets of fracture 
healing, the bispecific antibody shows superior bone repair activity compared 
with monotherapies. This work supports the potential of this agent both for 
treatment and prevention of fractures and offers a promising therapeutic 
approach to reduce the burden of low bone mass disorders.
