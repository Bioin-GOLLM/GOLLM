All sequencing experiments and most functional genomics screens rely on the 
generation of libraries to comprehensively capture pools of targeted sequences. 
In the past decade especially, driven by the progress in the field of massively 
parallel sequencing, numerous studies have comprehensively assessed the impact 
of particular manipulations on library complexity and quality, and characterized 
the activities and specificities of several key enzymes used in library 
construction. Fortunately, careful protocol design and reagent choice can 
substantially mitigate many of these biases, and enable reliable representation 
of sequences in libraries. This review aims to guide the reader through the vast 
expanse of literature on the subject to promote informed library generation, 
independent of the application.
