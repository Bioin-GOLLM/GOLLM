Leishmania parasites are thought to control protein activity at the 
post-translational level, e.g. by protein phosphorylation. In the pathogenic 
amastigote, the mammalian stage of Leishmania parasites, heat shock proteins 
show increased phosphorylation, indicating a role in stage-specific signal 
transduction. Here we investigate the impact of phosphosites in the L. donovani 
heat shock protein 90. Using a chemical knock-down/genetic complementation 
approach, we mutated 11 confirmed or presumed phosphorylation sites and assessed 
the impact on overall fitness, morphology and in vitro infectivity. Most 
phosphosite mutations affected the growth and morphology of promastigotes in 
vitro, but with one exception, none of the phosphorylation site mutants had a 
selective impact on the in vitro infection of macrophages. Surprisingly, 
aspartate replacements mimicking the negative charge of phosphorylated serines 
or threonines had mostly negative impacts on viability and infectivity. HSP90 is 
a substrate for casein kinase 1.2-catalysed phosphorylation in vitro. While 
several putative phosphosite mutations abrogated casein kinase 1.2 activity on 
HSP90, only Ser289 could be identified as casein kinase target by mass 
spectrometry. In summary, our data show HSP90 as a downstream client of 
phosphorylation-mediated signalling in an organism that depends on 
post-transcriptional gene regulation.
