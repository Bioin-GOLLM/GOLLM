Serotonin (5-HT) is a neuromodulator that has been attributed to cost assessment 
and harm aversion. In this review, we look at the role 5-HT plays in making 
decisions when subjects are faced with potential harmful or costly outcomes. We 
review approaches for examining the serotonergic system in decision-making. We 
introduce our group's paradigm used to investigate how 5-HT affects 
decision-making. In particular, our paradigm combines techniques from 
computational neuroscience, socioeconomic game theory, human-robot interaction, 
and Bayesian statistics. We will highlight key findings from our previous 
studies utilizing this paradigm, which helped expand our understanding of 5-HT's 
effect on decision-making in relation to cost assessment. Lastly, we propose a 
cyclic multidisciplinary approach that may aid in addressing the complexity of 
exploring 5-HT and decision-making by iteratively updating our assumptions and 
models of the serotonergic system through exhaustive experimentation.
