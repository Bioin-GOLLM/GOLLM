BACKGROUND: Angiostrongylus eosinophilic meningitis (AEM) is a rare yet emerging 
disease caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection. Its atypical symptoms 
may delay the diagnosis and cause fatal outcomes, especially in the early stages 
of infection and among children.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we reported the use of metagenomic next-generation 
sequencing (mNGS) to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of an 8-year-old boy 
with severe A. cantonensis infection. The mNGS tests consistently identified the 
infection of A. cantonensis prior to the detection by the immunologic method and 
confirmed it as AEM. Owing to the multidisciplinary team (MDT)-administrated 
treatments and close disease monitoring based on regular clinical tests and 
sequential mNGS tests, the patients eventually fully recovered from severe 
infectious conditions.
CONCLUSION: This case demonstrated the advantages of mNGS for early diagnosis of 
AEM in pediatric patients, highlighting its application for pan-pathogen 
detection, as well as disease monitoring for severe A. cantonensis infection.
