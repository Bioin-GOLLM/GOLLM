Background: Vertebral arteriovenous fistula (AVF) associated with 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is a rare condition in the previous reports. 
However, whether vertebral AVF in NF-1 is congenital or NF-1 disease progression 
hasn't been clarified. Case Description: We reported a 48-year-old male case of 
vertebral AVF simultaneously combined with thoracic scoliosis and NF-1. 
Preoperative CT angiography showed the AVF with multiple orifices located on the 
vessel wall of the vertebral artery, which was proved during the procedure of 
endovascular treatment. By occluding the parent vertebral artery, the AVF was 
finally cured. Further whole-exome sequencing identified a novel germline 
heterozygous point nonsense mutation, c.G397T(p.E133X), in the NF1(NM_000267) 
gene exon4. Conclusions: From this patient, we speculate that vertebral AVF 
associated with NF-1 might be a congenital disease as a manifestation of 
mesodermal dysplasia.
