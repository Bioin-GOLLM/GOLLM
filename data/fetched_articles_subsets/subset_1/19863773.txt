Genome-wide association studies are the most comprehensive and straightforward 
approach to teasing out the identity of genetic polymorphisms associated with 
any given disease or characteristic. With the availability of DNA banks from 
large cohorts of ethnically matched patients and healthy individuals it is now 
possible to define even marginal genetic associations between genetic 
polymorphisms and diseases. As increasing numbers of these studies are carried 
out and as associations with smaller and smaller risks are identified, there is 
the growing concern that the findings will be of increasingly marginal value. 
Thus, the glut of new genetic associations is rapidly overwhelming our interest 
in the results, a situation that could be described as TMI (too much 
information). Recent genetic association studies in rheumatoid arthritis suggest 
that we may be approaching the TMI stage of genome-wide association studies.
