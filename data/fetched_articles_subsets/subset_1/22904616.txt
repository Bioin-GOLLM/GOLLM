Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is an important public health problem, and 
the standard treatment (combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin) has 
an effectiveness rate of only 40%-50%. Novel virus-specific drugs have recently 
been designed, and multiple compounds are under development. The approval for 
the clinical use of direct-acting antivirals in 2011 (boceprevir [BOC] and 
telaprevir, viral NS3 protease inhibitors) has increased recovery rates by up to 
70%. Therefore, a highly effective treatment has been envisioned for the first 
time. This paper focuses on BOC and the implementation of new BOC-based 
treatment regimes.
