The spondylo-meta-epiphyseal dysplasia [SMED] short limb-hand type [SMED-SL] is 
a rare autosomal-recessive disease, first reported by Borochowitz et al. in 
1993.(1) Since then, 14 affected patients have been reported.(2-5) We diagnosed 
6 patients from 5 different consanguineous Arab Muslim families from the 
Jerusalem area with SMED-SL. Additionally, we studied two patients from Algerian 
and Pakistani ancestry and the parents of the first Jewish patients reported.(1) 
Using a homozygosity mapping strategy, we located a candidate region on 
chromosome 1q23 spanning 2.4 Mb. The position of the Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 
(DDR2) gene within the candidate region and the similarity of the ddr2 knockout 
mouse to the SMED patients' phenotype prompted us to study this gene(6). We 
identified three missense mutations c.2254 C > T [R752C], c. 2177 T > G [I726R], 
c.2138C > T [T713I] and one splice site mutation [IVS17+1g > a] in the conserved 
sequence encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the DDR2 gene. The results of 
this study will permit an accurate early prenatal diagnosis and carrier 
screening for families at risk.
