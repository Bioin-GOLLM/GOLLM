Bortezomib induced peripheral neuropathy is a dose-limiting side effect and a 
major concern in the treatment of multiple myeloma. To identify genetic risk 
factors associated with the development of this side effect in bortezomib 
treated multiple myeloma patients, a pharmacogenetic association study was 
performed using a discovery set (IFM 2005-01; n = 238) and a validation set 
(HOVON65/GMMG-HD4 and a Czech dataset; n = 231). After multiplicity correction, 
none of the 2,149 single nucleotide polymorphisms tested revealed any 
significant association with bortezomib induced peripheral neuropathy. However, 
56 single nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated an association with bortezomib 
induced peripheral neuropathy with pointwise, uncorrected significance. Pathway 
analysis of these polymorphisms demonstrated involvement of neurological disease 
(FDR <20%). Also a clear enrichment of major bortezomib metabolizing genes was 
found. Univariate evaluation of these 56 polymorphisms in the validation set 
demonstrated one single nucleotide polymorphism with pointwise significance: 
rs619824 in CYP17A1. (IFM 2005-01 clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00200681; 
HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 isrctn.org identifier: ISRCTN64455289).
