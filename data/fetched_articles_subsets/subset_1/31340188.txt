Routine erythropoietin (Epo) therapy for neonatal anemia is presently 
controversial due to its modest response. We speculate that an important 
contributor to this modest response is that previous clinical study designs were 
not driven by rigorous mechanistic and kinetic insights into the complex 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of Epo in this population. To 
address this therapeutic opportunity, we conducted a prospective clinical study 
to investigate the PK of Epo in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) premature neonates 
using a unique Epo dosing algorithm that accounts for complex neonatal 
erythropoietic physiology. Twenty-seven subjects received up to 10 intravenous 
or subcutaneous exogenous doses of Epo (600 or 1200 U/kg) during the first 
4 weeks of life. Subjects were administered two doses of Epo 1200 U/kg on days 2 
and 16, and eight doses of Epo 600 U/kg on days 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15, and 28 
following birth. We have developed for the first time a mechanistic, 
target-mediated disposition model that provides novel insights into the 
mechanisms driving Epo PK in VLBW neonates. Epo association rate, kon, was 
estimated to be 0.00610 pM-1h-1, and the dissociation rate koff was 0.112 h-1. 
Internalization of the Epo-target complex (kint) and the total receptor 
concentration (Rmax) were estimated to be 0.118 h-1 and 133 pM, respectively. 
Following s.c. administration, the absorption rate (ka) of Epo was 0.0738h-1 and 
bioavailability was 78.0%. Our mechanism-based population pharmacokinetic 
analysis provided quantitative insight into Epo kinetics in VLBW neonates; the 
information gained will assist in deriving dosing strategies for neonatal anemia 
and for neuroprotection efficacy studies.
