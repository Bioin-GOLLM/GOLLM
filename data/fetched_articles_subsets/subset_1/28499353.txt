BACKGROUND: Conjugation is a major type of horizontal transmission of genes that 
involves transfer of a plasmid into a recipient using specific conjugation 
machinery, which results in an extended spectrum of bacterial antibiotics 
resistance. However, there is inadequate knowledge about the regulator and 
mechanisms that control the conjugation processes, especially in an aquaculture 
environment where a cocktail of antibiotics may be present. Here, we 
investigated these with pEIB202, a typical multi-drug resistant IncP plasmid 
encoding tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfonamide and chloramphenicol resistance 
in fish pathogen Edwardsiella piscicida strain EIB202.
RESULTS: We used transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) to identify genes that 
are responsible for conjugation transfer of pEIB202. All ten of the 
plasmid-borne type IV secretion system (T4SS) genes and a putative lipoprotein 
p007 were identified to play an important role in pEIB202 horizontal transfer. 
Antibiotics appear to modulate conjugation frequencies by repressing T4SS gene 
expression. In addition, we identified topA gene, which encodes topoisomerase I, 
as an inhibitor of pEIB202 transfer. Furthermore, the RNA-seq analysis of the 
response regulator EsrB encoded on the chromosome also revealed its essential 
role in facilitating the conjugation by upregulating the T4SS genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our screens unraveled the genetic basis of the 
conjugation transfer of pEIB202 and the influence of horizontally acquired EsrB 
on this process. Our results will improve the understanding of the mechanism of 
plasmid conjugation processes that facilitate dissemination of antibiotic 
resistance especially in aquaculture industries.
