Western society has an increasing proportion of older adults. Increasing age is 
associated with a general decrease in the control over task-relevant mental 
processes. In the present study we investigated the possibility that successful 
transfer of game-based cognitive improvements to untrained tasks in elderly 
people is modulated by preexisting neuro-developmental factors as genetic 
variability related to levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 
an important neuromodulator underlying cognitive processes. We trained 
participants, genotyped for the BDNF Val(66)Met polymorphism, on cognitive tasks 
developed to improve dynamic attention. Pre-training (baseline) and 
post-training measures of attentional processes (divided and selective 
attention) were acquired by means of the useful field of view task. As expected, 
Val/Val homozygous individuals showed larger beneficial transfer effects than 
Met/-carriers. Our findings support the idea that genetic predisposition 
modulates transfer effects.
