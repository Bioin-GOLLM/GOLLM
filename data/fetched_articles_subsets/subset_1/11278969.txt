The sequence of human myoglobin (Mb) is similar to that of other species except 
for a unique cysteine at position 110 (Cys(110)). Adding hydrogen peroxide 
(H(2)O(2)) to human Mb affords Trp(14)-peroxyl, Tyr(103)-phenoxyl, and 
Cys(110)-thiyl radicals and coupling of Cys(110)-thiyl radicals yields a 
homodimer through intermolecular disulfide bond formation (Witting, P. K., 
Douglas, D. J., and Mauk, A. G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 20391-20398). 
Treating a solution of wild type Mb and H(2)O(2) with 
5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) at DMPO:protein </= 10 mol/mol yields 
DMPO-Cys(110) adducts as determined by EPR. At DMPO:protein ratios (25-50 
mol/mol), both DMPO-Tyr(103) and DMPO-Cys(110) adducts were detected, whereas at 
DMPO:protein >/= 100 mol/mol only DMPO-Tyr(103) radicals were present. The 
DMPO-dependent decrease in DMPO-Cys(110) was matched by a near 1:1 
stoichiometric increase in DMPO-Tyr(103). In contrast, reaction of the Y103F 
human Mb with H(2)O(2) gave no DMPO-Cys(110) at DMPO:protein </= 10 mol/mol, and 
only trace DMPO-Cys(110) at DMPO:protein >/= 100 mol/mol (i.e. conditions that 
consistently gave DMPO-Tyr(103) in the case of wild type Mb). No detectable 
homodimer was formed by incubation of the Y103F variant with H(2)O(2). However, 
the homodimer was detected in a mixture of both the Y103F and C110A variants of 
human Mb upon treatment with H(2)O(2) (C110A:Y103F:H(2)O(2) 2:1:5 mol/mol/mol); 
the yield of this homodimer increased with increasing ratios of C110A:Y103F. 
Together, these data suggest that addition of H(2)O(2) to human Mb can produce 
Cys(110)-thiyl radicals through an intermolecular electron transfer reaction 
from Cys(110) to a Tyr(103)-phenoxyl radical.
