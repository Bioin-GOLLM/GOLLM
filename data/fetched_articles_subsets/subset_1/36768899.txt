The ketogenic diet (KD) has been used as a treatment for epilepsy since the 
1920s, and its role in the prevention of many other diseases is now being 
considered. In recent years, there has been an intensive investigation on using 
the KD as a therapeutic approach to treat acute pathologies, including ischemic 
ones. However, contradictory data are observed for the effects of the KD on 
various organs after ischemic injury. In this review, we provide the first 
systematic analysis of studies conducted from 1980 to 2022 investigating the 
effects and main mechanisms of the KD and its mimetics on ischemia-reperfusion 
injury of the brain, heart, kidneys, liver, gut, and eyes. Our analysis 
demonstrated a high diversity of both the composition of the used KD and the 
protocols for the treatment of animals, which could be the reason for 
contradictory effects in different studies. It can be concluded that a true KD 
or its mimetics, such as Î²-hydroxybutyrate, can be considered as positive 
exposure, protecting the organ from ischemia and its negative consequences, 
whereas the shift to a rather similar high-calorie or high-fat diet leads to the 
opposite effect.
