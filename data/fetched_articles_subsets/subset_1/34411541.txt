Unrelated individuals can produce genetically similar clones of antibodies, 
known as public clonotypes, which have been seen in responses to different 
infectious diseases, as well as healthy individuals. Here we identify 37 public 
clonotypes in memory B cells from convalescent survivors of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or in plasmablasts 
from an individual after vaccination with mRNA-encoded spike protein. We 
identify 29 public clonotypes, including clones recognizing the receptor-binding 
domain (RBD) in the spike protein S1 subunit (including a neutralizing, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]-blocking clone that protects in vivo) and 
others recognizing non-RBD epitopes that bind the S2 domain. Germline-revertant 
forms of some public clonotypes bind efficiently to spike protein, suggesting 
these common germline-encoded antibodies are preconfigured for avid recognition. 
Identification of large numbers of public clonotypes provides insight into the 
molecular basis of efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and sheds light on the immune 
pressures driving the selection of common viral escape mutants.
