Increased homotropic allosteric effect, while maintaining normal heterotropic 
effects, was observed in hemoglobin Loire. The oxygen binding curves, at 
equilibrium, and the kinetic measurements demonstrated that the substitution of 
alpha 88(F9) Ala for a Ser results in increased oxygen affinity and decreased 
n50 value. The function of the residues involved in the Bohr effect or in the 
regulation by 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is not altered. The effects of 
bezafibrate, which binds specifically to the alpha chains, was similar to that 
observed in Hb A. The functional properties of Hb Loire may be explained by a 
slight displacement of some key residues of the C-terminal region of the alpha 
chain destabilizing the T structure.
