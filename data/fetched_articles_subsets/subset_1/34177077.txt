CoV2019 has evolved to be much more dangerous than CoV2003. Experiments suggest 
that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity. We 
identify a new first stage of infection that precedes structural rearrangements 
by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence differences 
enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of mutations which 
show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger viral attachment 
and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics of human 
coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary approach of 
self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very successful vaccine. 
The identified mutations can be used to test the present theory experimentally.
