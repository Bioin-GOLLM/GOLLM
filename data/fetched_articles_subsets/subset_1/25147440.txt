Osteoarthritis (OA) belongs to a group of degenerative diseases. Synovial 
inflammation, cartilage abrasion, and subchondral sclerosis are characteristics 
of OA. Researchers do not fully understand the exact etiology of OA. However, 
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are responsible for cartilage matrix 
degradation, play a pivotal role in the progression of OA. Amphiregulin (AREG) 
binds to the EGF receptor (EGFR) and activates downstream proteins. AREG is 
involved in a variety of pathological processes, such as the development of 
tumors, inflammatory diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 
relationship between AREG and MMP-13 in OA synovial fibroblasts (SFs) remains 
unclear. We investigated the signaling pathway involved in AREG-induced MMP-13 
production in SFs. AREG caused MMP-13 production in a concentration- and 
time-dependent manner. The results of using pharmacological inhibitors and EGFR 
siRNA to block EGFR revealed that the EGFR receptor was involved in the 
AREG-mediated upregulation of MMP-13. AREG-mediated MMP-13 production was 
attenuated by PI3K and Akt inhibitors. The stimulation of cells by using AREG 
activated p65 phosphorylation and p65 translocation from the cytosol to the 
nucleus. Our results provide evidence that AREG acts through the EGFR and 
activates PI3K, Akt, and finally NF-kappaB on the MMP-13 promoter, thus 
contributing to cartilage destruction during osteoarthritis.
