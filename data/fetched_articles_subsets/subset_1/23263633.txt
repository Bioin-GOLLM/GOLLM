Laminin-111 is a large trimeric basement membrane glycoprotein with many active 
sites. In particular, four peptides active in tumor malignancy studies have been 
identified in laminin-111 using a systematic peptide screening method followed 
by various assays. Two of the peptides (IKVAV and AG73) are found on the α1 
chain, one (YIGSR) of the β1 chain and one (C16) on the γ1 chain. The four 
peptides have distinct activities and receptors. Since three of the peptides 
(IKVAV, AG73 and C16) strongly promote tumor growth, this may explain the potent 
effects laminin-111 has on malignant cells. The peptide, YIGSR, decreases tumor 
growth and experimental metastasis via a 32/67 kD receptor while IKVAV increases 
tumor growth, angiogenesis and protease activity via integrin receptors. AG73 
increases tumor growth and metastases via syndecan receptors. C16 increases 
tumor growth and angiogenesis via integrins. Identification of such sites on 
laminin-111 will have use in defining strategies to develop therapeutics for 
cancer.
