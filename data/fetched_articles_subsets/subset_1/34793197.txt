Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the most widespread tick-borne 
zoonotic virus, with a 30% case fatality rate in humans. Structural information 
is lacking in regard to the CCHFV membrane fusion glycoprotein Gc—the main 
target of the host neutralizing antibody response—as well as antibody–mediated 
neutralization mechanisms. We describe the structure of prefusion Gc bound to 
the antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of two neutralizing antibodies that display 
synergy when combined, as well as the structure of trimeric, postfusion Gc. The 
structures show the two Fabs acting in concert to block membrane fusion, with 
one targeting the fusion loops and the other blocking Gc trimer formation. The 
structures also revealed the neutralization mechanism of previously reported 
antibodies against CCHFV, providing the molecular underpinnings essential for 
developing CCHFV–specific medical countermeasures for epidemic preparedness.
