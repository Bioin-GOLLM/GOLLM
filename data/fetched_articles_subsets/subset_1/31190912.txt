Staphylococcus aureus normally colonizes the nasal cavity and pharynx. After 
breaching the normal habitat, the organism is able to cause a number of 
infections at any site of the body. The development of antibiotic resistance has 
created a global challenge for treating infections. Therefore, protection by 
vaccines may provide valuable measures. Currently, several vaccine candidates 
have been prepared which are either in preclinical phase or in early clinical 
phase, whereas several candidates have failed to show a protective efficacy in 
human subjects. Approaches have also been made in the development of monoclonal 
or polyclonal antibodies for passive immunization to protect from S. aureus 
infections. Therefore, in this review we have summarized the findings of 
recently published scientific literature to make a concise report.
