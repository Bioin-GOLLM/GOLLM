Umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UCMSCs) have potential 
applications in regenerative medicine. UCMSCs have been demonstrated to repair 
tissue damage in many inflammatory and degenerative diseases. We have previously 
shown that UCMSC exosomes reduce nerve injury-induced pain in rats. In this 
study, we characterized UCMSC exosomes using RNA sequencing and proteomic 
analyses and investigated their protective effects on cisplatin-induced hearing 
loss in mice. Two independent experiments were designed to investigate the 
protective effects on cisplatin-induced hearing loss in mice: (i) chronic 
intraperitoneal cisplatin administration (4 mg/kg) once per day for 5 
consecutive days and intraperitoneal UCMSC exosome (1.2 μg/μL) injection at the 
same time point; and (ii) UCMSC exosome (1.2 μg/μL) injection through a round 
window niche 3 days after chronic cisplatin administration. Our data suggest 
that UCMSC exosomes exert protective effects in vivo. The post-traumatic 
administration of UCMSC exosomes significantly improved hearing loss and rescued 
the loss of cochlear hair cells in mice receiving chronic cisplatin injection. 
Neuropathological gene panel analyses further revealed the UCMSC exosomes 
treatment led to beneficial changes in the expression levels of many genes in 
the cochlear tissues of cisplatin-injected mice. In conclusion, UCMSC exosomes 
exerted protective effects in treating ototoxicity-induced hearing loss by 
promoting tissue remodeling and repair.
