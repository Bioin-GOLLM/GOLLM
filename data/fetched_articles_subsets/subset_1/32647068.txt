Engineering improved Rubisco for the enhancement of photosynthesis is challenged 
by the alternate locations of the chloroplast rbcL gene and nuclear RbcS genes. 
Here we develop an RNAi-RbcS tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) master-line, tobRrΔS, 
for producing homogenous plant Rubisco by rbcL-rbcS operon chloroplast 
transformation. Four genotypes encoding alternative rbcS genes and adjoining 
5'-intergenic sequences revealed that Rubisco production was highest (50% of the 
wild type) in the lines incorporating a rbcS gene whose codon use and 5' 
untranslated-region matched rbcL Additional tobacco genotypes produced here 
incorporated differing potato (Solanum tuberosum) rbcL-rbcS operons that either 
encoded one of three mesophyll small subunits (pS1, pS2, and pS3) or the potato 
trichome pST-subunit. The pS3-subunit caused impairment of potato Rubisco 
production by ∼15% relative to the lines producing pS1, pS2, or pST However, the 
βA-βB loop Asn-55-His and Lys-57-Ser substitutions in the pS3-subunit improved 
carboxylation rates by 13% and carboxylation efficiency (CE) by 17%, relative to 
potato Rubisco incorporating pS1 or pS2-subunits. Tobacco photosynthesis and 
growth were most impaired in lines producing potato Rubisco incorporating the 
pST-subunit, which reduced CE and CO2/O2 specificity 40% and 15%, respectively. 
Returning the rbcS gene to the plant plastome provides an effective 
bioengineering chassis for introduction and evaluation of novel homogeneous 
Rubisco complexes in a whole plant context.
