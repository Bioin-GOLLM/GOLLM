A markedly elevated BB isoenzyme fraction of serum creatine kinase was noted in 
four male siblings and correlated with typical radiographic findings of 
autosomal dominant osteopetrosis Type II (ADO Type II). Patients with other 
sclerosing bone diseases had no elevation of CK-BB. The precision of the 
electrophoretic mobility patterns and correlation by I-125 tagged 
radioimmunoassay method confirms that this is CK-BB. We postulate that the 
dysfunctional and/or immature osteoclasts in ADO are more dependent on CK-BB 
than on the usual tricarboxylic acid cycle for the production of energy. The 
correlation of marked elevation of serum CK-BB with radiographic evidence of ADO 
Type II may prove to be of value as a biologic marker in the early diagnosis of 
the illness and lead to better understanding of the metabolism of bone.
