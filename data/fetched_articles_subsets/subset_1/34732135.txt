BACKGROUND: In genus Rhinolophus, species in the Rhinolophus philippinensis and 
R. macrotis groups are unique because the horseshoe bats in these group have 
relatively low echolocation frequencies and flight speeds compared with other 
horseshoe bats with similar body size. The different characteristics among bat 
species suggest particular evolutionary processes may have occurred in this 
genus. To study the adaptive evidence in the mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) 
of rhinolophids, especially the mitogenomes of the species with low echolocation 
frequencies, we sequenced eight mitogenomes and used them for comparative 
studies of molecular phylogeny and adaptive evolution.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis using whole mitogenome sequences produced robust 
results and provided phylogenetic signals that were better than those obtained 
using single genes. The results supported the recent establishment of the 
separate macrotis group. The signals of adaptive evolution discovered in the 
Rhinolophus species were tested for some of the codons in two genes (ND2 and 
ND6) that encode NADH dehydrogenases in oxidative phosphorylation system complex 
I. These genes have a background of widespread purifying selection. Signals of 
relaxed purifying selection and positive selection were found in ND2 and ND6, 
respectively, based on codon models and physicochemical profiles of amino acid 
replacements. However, no pronounced overlap was found for non-synonymous sites 
in the mitogenomes of all the species with low echolocation frequencies. A 
signal of positive selection for ND5 was found in the branch-site model when R. 
philippinensis was set as the foreground branch.
CONCLUSIONS: The mitogenomes provided robust phylogenetic signals that were much 
more informative than the signals obtained using single mitochondrial genes. Two 
mitochondrial genes that encoding proteins in the oxidative phosphorylation 
system showed some evidence of adaptive evolution in genus Rhinolophus and the 
positive selection signals were tested for ND5 in R. philippinensis. These 
results indicate that mitochondrial protein-coding genes were targets of 
adaptive evolution during the evolution of Rhinolophus species, which might have 
contributed to a diverse range of acoustic adaptations in this genus.
