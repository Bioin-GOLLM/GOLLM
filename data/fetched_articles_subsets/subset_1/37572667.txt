Male sex represents one of the major risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcome. 
However, underlying mechanisms that mediate sex-dependent disease outcome are as 
yet unknown. Here, we identify the CYP19A1 gene encoding for the 
testosterone-to-estradiol metabolizing enzyme CYP19A1 (also known as aromatase) 
as a host factor that contributes to worsened disease outcome in 
SARS-CoV-2-infected males. We analyzed exome sequencing data obtained from a 
human COVID-19 cohort (n = 2,866) using a machine-learning approach and identify 
a CYP19A1-activity-increasing mutation to be associated with the development of 
severe disease in men but not women. We further analyzed human autopsy-derived 
lungs (n = 86) and detect increased pulmonary CYP19A1 expression at the time 
point of death in men compared with women. In the golden hamster model, we show 
that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes increased CYP19A1 expression in the lung that 
is associated with dysregulated plasma sex hormone levels and reduced long-term 
pulmonary function in males but not females. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected 
hamsters with a clinically approved CYP19A1 inhibitor (letrozole) improves 
impaired lung function and supports recovery of imbalanced sex hormones 
specifically in males. Our study identifies CYP19A1 as a contributor to 
sex-specific SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome in males. Furthermore, inhibition of 
CYP19A1 by the clinically approved drug letrozole may furnish a new therapeutic 
strategy for individualized patient management and treatment.
