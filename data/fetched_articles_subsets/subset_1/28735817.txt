Rare hereditary disorders provide unequivocal evidence of the importance of 
genes in human disease pathogenesis. Familial syndromes that predispose to 
osteosarcomagenesis are invaluable in understanding the underlying genetics of 
this malignancy. Recently, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSCs) have been successfully utilized to model Li-Fraumeni syndrome 
(LFS)-associated bone malignancy, demonstrating that iPSCs can serve as an in 
vitro disease model to elucidate osteosarcoma etiology. We provide here an 
overview of osteosarcoma predisposition syndromes and review recently 
established iPSC disease models for these familial syndromes. Merging molecular 
information gathered from these models with the current knowledge of 
osteosarcoma biology will help us to gain a deeper understanding of the 
pathological mechanisms underlying osteosarcomagenesis and will potentially aid 
in the development of future patient therapies.
