Genetic association of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1*2) polymorphism with 
NQO1 levels and risk of diabetic nephropathy.

NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) catalyzes reactions having a 
cyto-protective effect against redox cycling and oxidative stress. A single base 
polymorphism (C/T) at nucleotide 609 of the NQO1 gene impairs the stability and 
function of its protein. Its role in the development of diabetic nephropathy 
(DN) has not been deciphered. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the 
association of NQO1*2 (rs1800566) polymorphism with plasma NQO1 levels and DN. 
This study screened 600 participants including healthy controls (HC), type 2 
diabetes mellitus without complications (T2DM) and diabetic nephropathy (DN): 
200 each for studying NQO1*2 gene polymorphism using the PCR-RFLP. Plasma NQO1 
levels were measured by ELISA. Analysis of variance and logistic regression were 
used to evaluate the association of NQO1 polymorphism with plasma NQO1 levels 
and DN. The allelic frequencies of NQO1*1/NQO1*2 were 0.88/0.12 in HC, 
0.765/0.235 in T2DM and 0.65/0.35 in DN. Carriers of the NQO1*2 allele had 
significantly lower plasma NQO1 levels (p<0.05) and revealed higher risk towards 
the development of DN (OR=1.717, p=0.010). NQO1*2 SNP is a functional 
polymorphism having a significant effect on NQO1 levels. Our results indicate 
that NQO1*2 genotype may increase susceptibility to DN in north Indian subjects 
with T2DM.
