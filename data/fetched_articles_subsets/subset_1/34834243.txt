Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer in women globally after lung 
cancer. Presently, the most important approach for BC treatment consists of 
surgery, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The latter therapeutic 
methods are often unsuccessful in the treatment of BC because of their various 
side effects and the damage incurred to healthy tissues and organs. Currently, 
numerous nanoparticles (NPs) have been identified and synthesized to selectively 
target BC cells without causing any impairments to the adjacent normal tissues 
or organs. Based on an exploratory study, this comprehensive review aims to 
provide information on engineered NPs and their payloads as promising tools in 
the treatment of BC. Therapeutic drugs or natural bioactive compounds generally 
incorporate engineered NPs of ideal sizes and shapes to enhance their 
solubility, circulatory half-life, and biodistribution, while reducing their 
side effects and immunogenicity. Furthermore, ligands such as peptides, 
antibodies, and nucleic acids on the surface of NPs precisely target BC cells. 
Studies on the synthesis of engineered NPs and their impact on BC were obtained 
from PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. This review provides insights 
on the importance of engineered NPs and their methodology for validation as a 
next-generation platform with preventive and therapeutic effects against BC.
