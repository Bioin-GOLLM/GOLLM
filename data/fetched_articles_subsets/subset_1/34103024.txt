BACKGROUND: Milroy disease (MD) is a rare, autosomal-dominant disorder. Variants 
in the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4/VEGFR3) gene cause the symptoms of 
this disease. In this report, we investigated the variant in a large Chinese 
family with MD.
METHODS: We conducted Sanger sequencing of exons 17-26 of FLT4/VEGFR3 
(NM_182925.4). We assessed its pathogenicity based on the ACMG criteria and 
predicted it with an in silico program.
RESULTS: A heterozygous substitution (NM_182925.4 (FLT4/VEGFR3):c.2774 T>A, p. 
(Val925Glu)) was detected in all patients with MD but not in any healthy 
controls. The variant was evaluated as pathogenic according to the ACMG criteria 
and was predicted to be pathogenic using an in silico program.
CONCLUSIONS: In this report, we described a large family with MD caused by a 
missense variant in FLT4/VEGFR3 (NM_182925.4 (FLT4/VEGFR3_v001):c.2774 T>A, p. 
(Val925Glu)). There are phenotypic heterogeneities among family members, and 
further research should be conducted to explore the possible reasons.
