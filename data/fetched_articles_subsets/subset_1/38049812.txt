BACKGROUND: To study whether the four locus gene model consisting of ADRB2 
rs1042713, IL4 rs2243250, FCER1B rs569108 and L13 rs20541 can predict asthma of 
the Kazak children in Xinjiang, China.
METHODS: Four single nucleotide polymorphisms about the 4 genes were genotyped 
in asthma group and control group of Han children and Kazak children 
respectively. The frequencies of different genotypes and alleles were compared 
between the asthma group and the control group in the two nationalities. 
Different risk genotypes for asthma were evaluated in the two nationalities.
RESULTS: The differences about frequencies of genotypes in ADRB2 rs1042713 and 
IL4 rs2243250 and IL13 rs20541 between asthma group and control group were 
statistically significant in Han children, as were the frequencies of alleles in 
the 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms, but there were no statistical differences 
in FCER1B rs569108(P > 0.05). For the Kazak children, no differences were 
existed among all the genotypes and alleles in asthma group and control group. 
For the Han children, more children were asthma high risk genotype in the asthma 
group than those in the control group and no difference was found in the Kazak 
children.
CONCLUSIONS: The four locus gene model consisting of ADRB2 rs1042713, IL4 
rs2243250, FCER1B rs569108 and L13 rs20541 can predict asthma of Han children 
but not for the Kazak children in Xinjiang, which illustrating that the 
difference of asthma prevalence between different races is closely related to 
the genetic background.
