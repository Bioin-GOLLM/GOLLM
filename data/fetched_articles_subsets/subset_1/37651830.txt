Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are rare severe 
neurodevelopmental disorders with a cumulative incidence of 1:6.000 live births. 
Many epileptic conditions arise from single nucleotide variants in CACNA1A 
(calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 A), encoding the CaV2.1 calcium 
channel subunit. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are an optimal 
choice for modeling DEEs, as they can be differentiated in vitro into diverse 
neuronal subpopulations. Here, we report the generation of hiPSC lines with two 
pathogenic CACNA1A variants c.1767C > T, p. (Arg589Cys), referred to as R589C 
and c. 2139G > A, p.(Ala713Thr), referred to as A713T, previously associated 
with epilepsy. The variants were introduced into a hiPSC line from a healthy 
individual via CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology.
