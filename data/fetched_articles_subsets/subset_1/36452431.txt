•There is a lack of prospective level I evidence for the use of PBT for most 
adult cancers including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).•TORPEdO 
is the UK's first PBT clinical trial and aims to determine the benefits of PBT 
for OPSCC.•Training and support has been provided before and during the trial to 
reduce variations of contouring and radiotherapy planning.•There is a strong 
translational component within TORPEdO. Imaging and physics data along with 
blood, tissue collection will inform future studies in refining patient 
selection for IMPT.
