BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. 
Although lung cancer can metastasize to various organs such as the liver, lymph 
nodes, adrenal gland, bone, and brain, metastases to the digestive organs, 
especially the colon, are rare.
CASE SUMMARY: An 83-year-old man diagnosed with lung cancer received radiation 
and chemoimmunotherapy, resulting in a complete clinical response. One year 
after the initial lung cancer diagnosis, the patient presented with obstructive 
ileus caused by a tumor in the descending colon. An elective left hemicolectomy 
was successfully performed after the endoscopic placement of a self-expandable 
metallic stent (SEMS). Pathologically, the tumor of the descending colon was 
diagnosed as lung cancer metastasis. The postoperative course was uneventful, 
and the patient is in good condition 13 mo after surgery, with no signs of 
recurrence. The previous 23 cases of surgical resection of colonic metastasis 
from lung cancer were reviewed using PubMed to characterize their 
clinicopathological features and outcomes.
CONCLUSION: SEMS is useful for obstructive colonic metastasis as a bridge to 
surgery to avoid emergency operations.
