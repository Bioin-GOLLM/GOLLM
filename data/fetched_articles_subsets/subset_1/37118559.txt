Telomere repeat binding proteins (TRBs) belong to a family of proteins 
possessing a Myb-like domain which binds to telomeric repeats. Three members of 
this family (TRB1, TRB2, TRB3) from Arabidopsis thaliana have already been 
described as associated with terminal telomeric repeats (telomeres) or short 
interstitial telomeric repeats in gene promoters (telo-boxes). They are also 
known to interact with several protein complexes: telomerase, Polycomb 
repressive complex 2 (PRC2) E(z) subunits and the PEAT complex 
(PWOs-EPCRs-ARIDs-TRBs). Here we characterize two novel members of the TRB 
family (TRB4 and TRB5). Our wide phylogenetic analyses have shown that TRB 
proteins evolved in the plant kingdom after the transition to a terrestrial 
habitat in Streptophyta, and consequently TRBs diversified in seed plants. 
TRB4-5 share common TRB motifs while differing in several others and seem to 
have an earlier phylogenetic origin than TRB1-3. Their common Myb-like domains 
bind long arrays of telomeric repeats in vitro, and we have determined the 
minimal recognition motif of all TRBs as one telo-box. Our data indicate that 
despite the distinct localization patterns of TRB1-3 and TRB4-5 in situ, all 
members of TRB family mutually interact and also bind to telomerase/PRC2/PEAT 
complexes. Additionally, we have detected novel interactions between TRB4-5 and 
EMF2 and VRN2, which are Su(z)12 subunits of PRC2.
