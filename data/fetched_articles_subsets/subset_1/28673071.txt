BACKGROUND: Adult-type hypolactasia is a frequent condition of lactose 
malabsorption; in Europe the distribution of adult-type hypolactasia have been 
shown to display a North-South gradient. Genotyping for LCT-13910 C>T 
polymorphism has been proposed as a useful diagnostic marker of adult-type 
hypolactasia. Data concerning lactase non-persistent genotype distribution in 
Italy are confused and not well characterized. The aim of this study was to 
determine the prevalence of CC-genotype corresponding to lactase non-persistence 
in Italian population.
METHODS: We genotyped 1312 adult Italian subjects for LCT-13910 C>T polymorphism 
by KASPar chemistry (KBioscience Ltd., Hoddesdon, England, UK).
RESULTS: The frequency of the lactase non-persistence genotype of our sample was 
62.3% that was higher than the values published for adult hypolactasia in Italy. 
In our study a frequency of 58.6%, 74.1% and 67.1% was detected in the three 
main macro-regions of Italy (North, Center, and South), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time we analyzed the distribution of the LCT-13910 CC 
genotype in a big population of Italian subjects. Our data did not validate the 
presence of a North-South gradient for adult hypolactasia along the Italian 
peninsula.
