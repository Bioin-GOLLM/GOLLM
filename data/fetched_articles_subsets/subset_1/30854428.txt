Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a crucial regulator of cell cycle progression; but 
the mechanism of regulation of Plk1 activity is not well understood. We present 
evidence that Plk1 activity is controlled by a balanced methylation and 
phosphorylation switch. The methyltransferase G9a monomethylates Plk1 at Lys209, 
which antagonizes phosphorylation of T210 to inhibit Plk1 activity. We found 
that the methyl-deficient Plk1 mutant K209A affects DNA replication, whereas the 
methyl-mimetic Plk1 mutant K209M prolongs metaphase-to-anaphase duration through 
the inability of sister chromatids separation. We detected accumulation of Plk1 
K209me1 when cells were challenged with DNA damage stresses. Ablation of K209me1 
delays the timely removal of RPA2 and RAD51 from DNA damage sites, indicating 
the critical role of K209me1 in guiding the machinery of DNA damage repair. 
Thus, our study highlights the importance of a methylation-phosphorylation 
switch of Plk1 in determining its kinase activity and functioning in DNA damage 
repair.
