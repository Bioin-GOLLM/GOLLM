There are two half-mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit of the title compound, 
C(32)H(30)Cl(4)N(4), in both of which the N-H bonds are syn to the meta-chloro 
substituents in the adjacent benzene ring. The other two Cl atoms of these two 
mol-ecules are disordered with occunpancy ratios of 0.79 (2):0.21 (2) and 
0.68 (1):0.32 (1). Adjacent chloro-phenyl rings make dihedral angles of 74.3 (2) 
and 63.0 (2)° in the two mol-ecules. In the crystal, inter-molecular N-H⋯N 
hydrogen bonds link the mol-ecules into infinite chains.
