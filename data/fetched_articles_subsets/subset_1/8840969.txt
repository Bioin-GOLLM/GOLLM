The nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), or Gorlin syndrome, is a 
multisystem autosomal dominant disorder. The salient features of this syndrome 
include multiple basal cell carcinomas, palmar and/or plantar pits, odontogenic 
keratocysts, skeletal and developmental anomalies, and ectopic calcification. 
Other features include such tumors as ovarian fibromas and medulloblastomas. 
There is extensive interfamilial as well as intrafamilial variability with 
respect to the manifestation and severity of the phenotype. Alterations in the 
human homologue (PTCH) of the Drosophila segment polarity gene patched have been 
identified in NBCCS patients as well as tumors associated with this syndrome. We 
report several mutations in this gene in NBCCS patients and present the clinical 
phenotypes of the individuals in whom these mutations were identified.
