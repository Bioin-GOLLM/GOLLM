Structure-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of very 
potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors are described. In an effort to improve backbone 
ligand-binding site interactions, we have incorporated basic-amines at the C4 
position of the bis-tetrahydrofuran (bis-THF) ring. We speculated that these 
substituents would make hydrogen bonding interactions in the flap region of 
HIV-1 protease. Synthesis of these inhibitors was performed 
diastereoselectively. A number of inhibitors displayed very potent enzyme 
inhibitory and antiviral activity. Inhibitors 25f, 25i, and 25j were evaluated 
against a number of highly-PI-resistant HIV-1 strains, and they exhibited 
improved antiviral activity over darunavir. Two high resolution X-ray structures 
of 25f- and 25g-bound HIV-1 protease revealed unique hydrogen bonding 
interactions with the backbone carbonyl group of Gly48 as well as with the 
backbone NH of Gly48 in the flap region of the enzyme active site. These 
ligand-binding site interactions are possibly responsible for their potent 
activity.
