BACKGROUND: Ellis-van Creveld (EvC) syndrome is characterized by short limbs, 
short ribs, postaxial polydactyly, dysplastic nails and teeth and is inherited 
in an autosomal recessive pattern. We report a family with complex septal 
cardiac defects, rhizomelic limb shortening, and polydactyly, without the 
typical lip, dental, and nail abnormalities of EvC. The phenotype was inherited 
in an autosomal recessive pattern, with one instance of pseudodominant 
inheritance.
METHODS: Because of the phenotypic overlap with EvC, microsatellite markers were 
used to test for linkage to the EVC/EVC2 locus. The results did not exclude 
linkage, so samples were sequenced for mutations.
RESULTS: We identified a c.1868T>C mutation in EVC, which predicts p.L623P, and 
was homozygous in affected individuals.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that this EVC mutation is hypomorphic and that such 
mutations can cause a phenotype of cardiac and limb defects that is less severe 
than typical EvC. EVC mutation analysis should be considered in patients with 
cardiac and limb malformations, even if they do not manifest typical EvC 
syndrome.
