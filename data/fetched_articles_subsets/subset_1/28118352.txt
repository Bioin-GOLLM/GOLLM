BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that greater maternal adiposity during 
pregnancy affects lifelong risk of offspring fatness via intrauterine 
mechanisms. Our aim was to use Mendelian randomisation (MR) to investigate the 
causal effect of intrauterine exposure to greater maternal body mass index (BMI) 
on offspring BMI and fat mass from childhood to early adulthood.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used maternal genetic variants as instrumental 
variables (IVs) to test the causal effect of maternal BMI in pregnancy on 
offspring fatness (BMI and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA] determined fat 
mass index [FMI]) in a MR approach. This was investigated, with repeat 
measurements, from ages 7 to 18 in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and 
Children (ALSPAC; n = 2,521 to 3,720 for different ages). We then sought to 
replicate findings with results for BMI at age 6 in Generation R (n = 2,337 for 
replication sample; n = 6,057 for total pooled sample). In confounder-adjusted 
multivariable regression in ALSPAC, a 1 standard deviation (SD, equivalent of 
3.7 kg/m2) increase in maternal BMI was associated with a 0.25 SD (95% CI 
0.21-0.29) increase in offspring BMI at age 7, with similar results at later 
ages and when FMI was used as the outcome. A weighted genetic risk score was 
generated from 32 genetic variants robustly associated with BMI (minimum 
F-statistic = 45 in ALSPAC). The MR results using this genetic risk score as an 
IV in ALSPAC were close to the null at all ages (e.g., 0.04 SD (95% CI 
-0.21-0.30) at age 7 and 0.03 SD (95% CI -0.26-0.32) at age 18 per SD increase 
in maternal BMI), which was similar when a 97 variant generic risk score was 
used in ALSPAC. When findings from age 7 in ALSPAC were meta-analysed with those 
from age 6 in Generation R, the pooled confounder-adjusted multivariable 
regression association was 0.22 SD (95% CI 0.19-0.25) per SD increase in 
maternal BMI and the pooled MR effect (pooling the 97 variant score results from 
ALSPAC with the 32 variant score results from Generation R) was 0.05 SD (95%CI 
-0.11-0.21) per SD increase in maternal BMI (p-value for difference between the 
two results = 0.05). A number of sensitivity analyses exploring violation of the 
MR results supported our main findings. However, power was limited for some of 
the sensitivity tests and further studies with relevant data on maternal, 
offspring, and paternal genotype are required to obtain more precise (and 
unbiased) causal estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide little evidence to support a strong causal 
intrauterine effect of incrementally greater maternal BMI resulting in greater 
offspring adiposity.
