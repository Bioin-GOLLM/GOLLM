BACKGROUND: Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) is a combination of an antipseudomonal 
oxyiminoaminothiazolyl cephalosporin with potent in vitro activity against 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and tazobactam, a known β-lactamase inhibitor. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the activity of C/T against clinical isolates of P. 
aeruginosa and Enterobacterales collected from five Latin American countries 
between 2016 and 2017, before its clinical use in Latin America, and to compare 
it with the activity of other available broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.
METHODS: a total of 2760 clinical isolates (508 P. aeruginosa and 2252 
Enterobacterales) were consecutively collected from 20 hospitals and 
susceptibility to C/T and comparator agents was tested and interpreted following 
the current guidelines.
RESULTS: according to the CLSI breakpoints, 68.1% (346/508) of P. aeruginosa and 
83.9% (1889/2252) of Enterobacterales isolates were susceptible to C/T. Overall, 
C/T demonstrated higher in vitro activity than currently available 
cephalosporins, piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems when tested against P. 
aeruginosa, and its performance in vitro was comparable to fosfomycin. When 
tested against Enterobacterales, it showed higher activity than cephalosporins 
and piperacillin/tazobactam, and similar activity to ertapenem.
CONCLUSIONS: these results show that C/T is an active β-lactam agent against 
clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales.
