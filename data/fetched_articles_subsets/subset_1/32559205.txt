Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most malignant form of primary liver cancer, 
is the fourth most prevalent cause of cancer mortality globally. It was recently 
discovered that the dietary fermentable fiber, inulin, can reprogram the murine 
liver to favor HCC development in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Determining 
the molecular pathways that are either over expressed or repressed during 
inulin-induced HCC would provide a platform of potential therapeutic targets. In 
the present study, we have combined analysis of the novel inulin-induced HCC 
murine model and human HCC samples to identify differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) in hepatocarcinogenesis. Hepatic transcriptome profiling revealed that 
there were 674 DEGs in HCC mice compared to mice safeguarded from HCC. Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis uncovered enrichment 
in ECM-receptor interaction, steroid hormone biosynthesis, PPAR signaling 
pathway, focal adhesion and protein digestion and absorption during 
inulin-induced HCC. Tandem mass tag based quantitative, multiplexed proteomic 
analysis delineated 57 differentially expressed proteins, where the 
over-expressed proteins were associated with cell adhesion molecules, valine, 
leucine and isoleucine degradation and ECM-receptor interaction. After obtaining 
the human orthologs of the mouse genes, we did a comparison analysis to level 3 
RNA-seq data found in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, corresponding to 
human HCC (n = 361) and healthy liver (n = 50) samples. Out of the 549 
up-regulated and 68 down-regulated human orthologs identified, 142 genes (137 
significantly over-expressed and 5 significantly under-expressed) were 
associated with human HCC. Using univariate survival analysis, we found 27 
over-expressed genes involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell division that were 
associated with poor HCC patient survival. Overall, the genetic and proteomics 
signatures highlight potential underlying mechanisms in inulin-induced HCC and 
support that this murine HCC model is human relevant.
