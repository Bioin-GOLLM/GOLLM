TRAF-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated domain B (TIFAB) is 
implicated in myeloid malignancies with deletion of chromosome 5q. Employing a 
combination of proteomic and genetic approaches, we find that TIFAB regulates 
ubiquitin-specific peptidase 15 (USP15) ubiquitin hydrolase activity. Expression 
of TIFAB in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) permits USP15 signaling 
to substrates, including MDM2 and KEAP1, and mitigates p53 expression. 
Consequently, TIFAB-deficient HSPCs exhibit compromised USP15 signaling and are 
sensitized to hematopoietic stress by derepression of p53. In MLL-AF9 leukemia, 
deletion of TIFAB increases p53 signaling and correspondingly decreases leukemic 
cell function and development of leukemia. Restoring USP15 expression partially 
rescues the function of TIFAB-deficient MLL-AF9 cells. Conversely, elevated 
TIFAB represses p53, increases leukemic progenitor function, and correlates with 
MLL gene expression programs in leukemia patients. Our studies uncover a 
function of TIFAB as an effector of USP15 activity and rheostat of p53 signaling 
in stressed and malignant HSPCs.
