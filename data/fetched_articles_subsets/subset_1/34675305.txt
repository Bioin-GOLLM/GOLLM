Alport syndrome is an inherited chronic human kidney disease, characterized by 
glomerular basement membrane abnormalities. This disease is caused by mutations 
in COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 gene. The knockout mice for Col4α3, Col4α4, and 
Col4α5 are developed and well characterized for the study of Alport syndrome. 
However, disease progression and effects of pharmacological therapy depend on 
the genetic variability. This model was reliable only to mouse. In this study, 
we created a novel Alport syndrome rat model utilizing the rGONAD technology, 
which generated rat with a deletion of the Col4α5 gene. Col4α5 deficient rats 
showed hematuria, proteinuria, high levels of BUN, Cre, and then died at 18 to 
28 weeks of age (Hemizygous mutant males). Histological and ultrastructural 
analyses displayed the abnormalities including parietal cell hyperplasia, 
mesangial sclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis. Then, we demonstrated that 
α3/α4/α5 (IV) and α5/α5/α6 (IV) chains of type IV collagen disrupted in Col4α5 
deficient rats. Thus, Col4α5 mutant rat is a reliable candidate for the Alport 
syndrome model for underlying the mechanism of kidney diseases and further 
identifying potential therapeutic targets for human renal diseases.
