Pim Kinases; Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3, are a family of constitutively active 
serine/threonine kinases, widely associated with cell survival, proliferation, 
and migration. Historically considered to be functionally redundant, independent 
roles for the individual isoforms have been described. Whilst most established 
for their role in cancer progression, there is increasing evidence for wider 
pathological roles of Pim kinases within the context of cardiovascular disease, 
including inflammation, thrombosis, and cardiac injury. The Pim kinase isoforms 
have widespread expression in cardiovascular tissues, including the heart, 
coronary artery, aorta, and blood, and have been demonstrated to be upregulated 
in several co-morbidities/risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Pim kinase 
inhibition may thus be a desirable therapeutic for a multi-targeted approach to 
treat cardiovascular disease and some of the associated risk factors. In this 
review, we discuss what is known about Pim kinase expression and activity in 
cells of the cardiovascular system, identify areas where the role of Pim kinase 
has yet to be fully explored and characterised and review the suitability of 
targeting Pim kinase for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular events 
in high-risk individuals.
