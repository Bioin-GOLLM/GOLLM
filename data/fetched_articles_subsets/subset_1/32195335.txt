Antibodies are essential for elucidating gene function. However, affordable 
technology for proteome-scale antibody generation does not exist. To address 
this, we developed Proteome Epitope Tag Antibody Library (PETAL) and its array. 
PETAL consists of 62,208 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against 15,199 peptides 
from diverse proteomes. PETAL harbors binders for a great multitude of proteins 
in nature due to antibody multispecificity, an intrinsic antibody feature. 
Distinctive combinations of 10,000 to 20,000 mAbs were found to target specific 
proteomes by array screening. Phenotype-specific mAb-protein pairs were found 
for maize and zebrafish samples. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry mAbs for 
membrane proteins and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing mAbs for 
transcription factors were identified from respective proteome-binding PETAL 
mAbs. Differential screening of cell surface proteomes of tumor and normal 
tissues identified internalizing tumor antigens for antibody-drug conjugates. By 
finding high-affinity mAbs at a fraction of current time and cost, PETAL enables 
proteome-scale antibody generation and target discovery.
