The current study was designed to investigate effect of copper administration on 
oxidative damage to the brain in ApoE-/- mice and to explore the putative 
neuroprotective effects rendered by apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Male C57BL/6 
ApoE-/- and wild-type mice were randomly assigned into four groups, ApoE-/- mice 
wild-type mice treated with either copper or saline. Copper sulphate 
pentahydrate or saline (200 µl) were administered intragastrically daily for 12 
weeks. Expression of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase (SOD), hemeoxygenase 
1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) were determined by a 
combination of biochemical assays. The concentration of copper in the brain of 
C57BL/6 mice and ApoE-/- mice treated by copper significantly increased compared 
with mice treated by saline (P=0.0099 and P=0.0443). Compared with the C57BL/6 
mice treated by copper, the level of the ApoE-/- mice treated by copper was 
higher (P=0.018). TBARS and SOD activities or the expressions of NQO1 and HO-1 
in the brain were not significantly different amongst the four experimental 
groups of mice. The relative value of NQO1/β-actin expression in the brain of 
the ApoE-/- mice was similar in both saline and copper administration 
experimental groups. However, Western blot analysis showed that NQO1 expression 
was significantly higher in the ApoE-/- mice brain treated with saline compared 
with saline treated wild-type mice (P=0.0449). ApoE does not function in 
protecting the brain from oxidative damage resulting from copper build-up in 
Wilson's disease, but may play a role in regulating copper accumulation in the 
brain.
