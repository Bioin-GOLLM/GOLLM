BACKGROUND: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades are important to 
cellular signaling in eukaryotes. They regulate growth, development and the 
response to environmental challenges. MPK cascades function via reversible 
phosphorylation of cascade components, MEKK, MEK, and MPK, but also by MPK 
substrate phosphorylation. Using mass spectrometry, we previously identified 
many in vivo MPK3 and MPK6 substrates in Arabidopsis thaliana, and we disclosed 
their phosphorylation sites.
RESULTS: We verified phosphorylation of several of our previously identified 
MPK3/6 substrates using a nonradioactive in vitro labeling assay. We engineered 
MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 to accept bio-orthogonal ATPÎ³S analogs for 
thiophosphorylating their appropriate substrate proteins. Subsequent alkylation 
of the thiophosphorylated amino acid residue(s) allows immunodetection using 
thiophosphate ester-specific antibodies. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino 
acids confirmed the protein substrates' site-specific phosphorylation by MPK3 
and MPK6. A combined assay with MPK3, MPK6, and MPK4 revealed substrate 
specificity of the individual kinases.
CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrates that the in vitro-labeling assay represents an 
effective, specific and highly sensitive test for determining kinase-substrate 
relationships.
