Cardiovascular disease is still a major cause of ill-health and mortality, heart 
failure and arrhythmia being among the causes of sudden cardiac death. There are 
few drugs available for treatment or prevention and it remains difficult to 
predict who will develop these conditions, even when disease-causing mutations 
or associated gene variants are identified in individuals or families. This is 
in part because widely used rodent models may not fully capture the physiology 
of the human heart. The advent of pluripotent stem cell technology that allows 
cardiovascular cells to be derived from patients and healthy individuals, in 
some cases genetically matched through mutation repair, is leading to paradigm 
shifts in how cardiovascular diseases are studied in humans. However, these 
cells are often only partially mature imposing some limitations in use. This 
Perspective reviews aspects of recent advances but also remaining challenges.
