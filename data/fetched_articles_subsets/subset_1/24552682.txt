Sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) was obtained in 65 adolescents referred for 
assessment of cardiometabolic risk. We found that SAD was associated with 
cardiometabolic risk factors independent of BMI in males, but that SAD was not 
superior to BMI or other measures of abdominal adiposity for the detection of 
metabolic syndrome.
