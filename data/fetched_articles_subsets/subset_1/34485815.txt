BACKGROUND: Adipocyte-derived adiponectin may play a role in the host 
inflammatory response to cancer. We examined the association of plasma 
adiponectin with the density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in colon 
cancers and with vitamin D, clinicopathological features, and patient survival.
METHODS: Plasma adiponectin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were analyzed by 
radioimmunoassay in 600 patients with stage III colon cancer who received 
FOLFOX-based adjuvant chemotherapy (NCCTG N0147 [Alliance]). TIL densities were 
determined in histopathological sections. Associations with disease-free 
survival (DFS), time to recurrence, and overall survival were evaluated by 
multivariable Cox regression adjusting for potential confounders (ie, body mass 
index, race, TILs, and N stage). All statistical tests were 2-sided.
RESULTS: We found a statistically significant reduction in adiponectin, but not 
25(OH)D, levels in tumors with high vs low TIL densities (median = 6845 vs 
8984 ng/mL; P = .04). A statistically significant reduction in adiponectin was 
also observed in obese (body mass index >30 kg/m2) vs nonobese patients 
(median = 6608 vs 12 351 ng/mL; P < .001), in men vs women (median = 8185 vs 11 
567 ng/mL; P < .001), in Blacks vs Whites or Asians (median = 6412 vs 8847 vs 
7858 ng/mL; P < .03), and in those with fewer lymph node metastases (N1 vs N2: 
median = 7768 vs 9253 ng/mL; P = .01). Insufficiency of 25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL) was 
detected in 291 (48.5%) patients. In multivariable analyses, neither adiponectin 
nor 25(OH)D were associated with a statistically significant difference in DFS, 
overall survival , or time to recurrence in models adjusted for potential 
confounders. We found a statistically significant association of TILs with 
prognosis, yet no such interaction was observed for the association of 
adiponectin with TILs for DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower circulating adiponectin levels were associated with a 
statistically significant increase in TIL densities in colon cancers, indicating 
an enhanced antitumor immune response. In contrast to TILs, neither adiponectin 
nor 25(OH)D was independently prognostic.
