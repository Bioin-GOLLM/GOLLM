Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε, catechol-O-methytranferase (COMT) Val108/158Met and 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) were shown to affect stress perception and response. The 
present study explored possible associations between these SNPs and changes in 
subclinical anxiety- and depressive symptoms, sense of coherence (SOC) and vital 
exhaustion (VE) during compulsory basic military training. The study encompassed 
179 conscripts of a training base in Greece. The neuropsychiatric assessment was 
based on the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the 
Antonovsky SOC scale and the Maastricht Questionnaire. It was conducted at three 
time points of the 19-day basic military training: on day one (baseline), day 
six (follow-up I) and day 13 (follow-up II). Statistical analyses included 
Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square test and cross-sectional time series regression 
models based on the Skillings-Mack statistic. APOE ε4 non-carriers encountered 
significant changes in anxiety- and depressive symptoms and SOC (in all cases 
P < 0.001) over the observation period, whilst ε4 carriers did not. The changes 
in anxiety, depressive symptoms and SOC attained statistical significance in 
both BDNF Met66 carriers (in all cases P < 0.001) and non-carriers 
(P = 0.036; < 0.001; < 0.001, respectively) as well as in COMT Met108/158 
carriers (P = 0.004; < 0.001; < 0.001, respectively) and non-carriers (P = 0.02; 
0.01; 0.021, respectively. Changes over time in VE were not significant 
(P > 0.05). The observed resistance of APOE ε4 carriers vs non-carriers to 
changes in anxiety- and depressive symptoms and SOC when exposed to a stressful 
environment may point to superior coping capacities of healthy young men 
carrying the ε4 allele.
