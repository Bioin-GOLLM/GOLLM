The precise role played by the tumor suppressor gene NF1 in melanocyte biology 
and during the transformation into melanoma is not completely understood. In 
particular, understanding the interaction during melanocyte development between 
NF1 and key signaling pathways, which are known to be reactivated in advanced 
melanoma, is still under investigation. Here, we used RNAseq datasets from 
either situation to better understand the transcriptomic regulation mediated by 
an NF1 partial loss of function. We found that NF1 mutations had a differential 
impact on pluripotency and on melanoblast differentiation. In addition, major 
signaling pathways such as VEGF, senescence/secretome, endothelin, and cAMP/PKA 
are likely to be upregulated upon NF1 loss of function in both melanoblasts and 
metastatic melanoma. In sum, these data bring new light on the transcriptome 
regulation of the NF1-mutated melanoma subgroup and will help improve the 
possibilities for specific treatment.
