Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using genome-edited cells can 
become a definitive therapy for hematological and non-hematological disorders 
with neurological involvement. Proof-of-concept studies using human 
genome-edited hematopoietic stem cells have been hindered by the low efficiency 
of engraftment of the edited cells in the bone marrow and their modest efficacy 
in the CNS. To address these challenges, we tested a myeloablative conditioning 
regimen based on Busulfan in an immunocompromised model of mucopolysaccharidosis 
type 1. Compared with sub-lethal irradiation, Busulfan conditioning enhanced the 
engraftment of edited CD34+ cells in the bone marrow, as well the long-term 
homing and survival of bone-marrow-derived cells in viscera, and in the CNS, 
resulting in higher transgene expression and biochemical correction in these 
organs. Edited cell selection using a clinically compatible marker resulted in a 
population with low engraftment potential. We conclude that conditioning can 
impact the engraftment of edited hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, 
Busulfan-conditioned recipients have a higher expression of therapeutic proteins 
in target organs, particularly in the CNS, constituting a better conditioning 
approach for non-hematological diseases with neurological involvement.
