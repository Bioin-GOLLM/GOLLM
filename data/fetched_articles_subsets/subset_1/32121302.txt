Neurodegenerative diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease 
(PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple 
sclerosis are becoming one of the main health concerns due to the increasing 
aging of the world's population. These diseases often share the same biological 
mechanisms, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and/or protein 
fibrillation. Recently, there have been many studies published pointing out the 
possibilities to reduce and postpone the clinical manifestation of these deadly 
diseases through lifelong consumption of some crucial dietary substances, among 
which phytochemicals (e.g., polyphenols) and endogenous substances (e.g., 
acetyl-L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, n-3 poysaturated fatty acids) showed the most 
promising results. Another important issue that has been pointed out recently is 
the availability of these substances to the central nervous system, where they 
have to be present in high enough concentrations in order to exhibit their 
neuroprotective properties. As so, such the aim of this review is to summarize 
the recent findings regarding neuroprotective substances, their mechanisms of 
action, as well as to point out therapeutic considerations, including their 
bioavailability and safety for humans.
