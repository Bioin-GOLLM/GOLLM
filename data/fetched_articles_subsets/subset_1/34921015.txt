There is an unmet need to identify and validate tumor-specific therapeutic 
targets to enable more effective treatments for cancer. Heterogeneity in patient 
clinical characteristics as well as biological and genetic features of tumors 
present major challenges for the optimization of therapeutic interventions, 
including the development of novel and more effective precision medicine. The 
expression of keratin 17 (K17) is a hallmark of the most aggressive forms of 
cancer across a wide range of anatomical sites and histological types. K17 
correlates with shorter patient survival, predicts resistance to specific 
chemotherapeutic agents, and harbors functional domains that suggest it could be 
therapeutically targeted. Here, we explore the role of K17 in the hallmarks of 
cancer and summarize evidence to date for K17-mediated mechanisms involved in 
each hallmark, elucidating functional roles that warrant further investigation 
to guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
