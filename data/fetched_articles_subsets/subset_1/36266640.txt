OBJECTIVE: The incidence of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) concomitant with 
Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is gradually increasing over the past decades. This 
study aims to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs between tumor tissues of 
PTC with or without HT and further to confer a better understanding of 
lncRNA-based competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network in PTC with HT.
METHODS: GSE138198 containing tissue mRNA data and GSE192560 containing lncRNA 
data were utilized to perform differentially expression analysis. The ceRNA 
network was constructed based on miRNA-mRNA interactions merging with 
lncRNA-microRNA interactions. Functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) analysis were performed. The mRNA levels of core genes in the 
PPI analysis in tumor tissues collected from 112 PTC patients including 35 cases 
coexistent with HT were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR).
RESULTS: A total of 57 genes and 40 lncRNAs, with value of |log2 fold change 
(FC)|≥ 1 and the adjusted P-value < 0.05, were deemed as differentially 
expressed genes and lncRNAs between PTC with and without HT. The pathways most 
significantly enriched by differentially expressed genes between PTC with and 
without HT were viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor 
and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL5, FCGR3A, and 
CCR2 owned degree values not less than 10 were deemed as core genes 
differentially expressed between PTC with and without HT. A total of 76 pairs of 
lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA were obtained. Results of qRT-PCR partially demonstrated 
the bioinformatics results that the mRNA levels of CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL5, and CCR2 
were remarkably elevated in tumor tissues collected from PTC patients coexistent 
with HT than those without HT (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our study offers a better understanding of the lncRNA-related ceRNA 
network involved in PTC with HT, providing novel key genes associated with PTC 
coexistent with HT.
