The autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) comprise a cadre of complex diseases 
whose underlying pathoetiology stems from a genetic-environmental interaction, 
between susceptibility genes (e.g. CTLA-4, HLA-DR, thyroglobulin) and 
environmental triggers (e.g. dietary iodine), that orchestrates the initiation 
of an autoimmune response to thyroid antigens, leading to the onset of disease. 
Abundant epidemiological data, including family and twin studies, point to a 
strong genetic influence on the development of AITD. Several AITD susceptibility 
genes have been identified, with HLA genes, in particular, appearing to be of 
major importance. Early studies showed association of HLA-DR3 with Graves' 
disease (GD) in Caucasians. More recently, the importance of an amino acid 
substitution at position 74 of the DR beta 1 chain of HLA-DR3 (DRb1-Arg74), in 
susceptibility to Graves' disease, has been shown. Furthermore, there is 
increasing evidence for a genetic interaction between thyroglobulin variants and 
DRb1-Arg74 in conferring risk for GD. Mechanistically, the presence of an 
arginine at position 74 elicits a significant structural change in the peptide 
binding pocket of HLA-DR, potentially affecting the binding of pathogenic 
thyroidal peptides. Future therapeutic interventions may attempt to exploit this 
new bolus of knowledge by endeavoring to block or modulate pathogenic peptide 
presentation by HLA-DR.
