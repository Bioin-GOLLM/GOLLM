Mutations in more than 80 different positions in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) 
have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS). There is 
substantial evidence that a common consequence of these mutations is to induce 
the protein to misfold and aggregate. How these mutations perturb native 
structure to heighten the propensity to misfold and aggregate is unclear. In the 
present study, we have mutagenized Glu residues at positions 40 and 133 that are 
involved in stabilizing the β-barrel structure of the native protein and a 
critical Zn binding domain, respectively, to examine how specific mutations may 
cause SOD1 misfolding and aggregation. Mutations associated with ALS as well as 
experimental mutations were introduced into these positions. We used an assay in 
which mutant SOD1 was fused to yellow fluorescent protein (SOD1:YFP) to 
visualize the formation of cytosolic inclusions by mutant SOD1. We then used 
existing structural data on SOD1, to predict how different mutations might alter 
local 3D conformation. Our findings reveal an association between mutant SOD1 
aggregation and amino acid substitutions that are predicted to introduce steric 
strain, sometimes subtly, in the 3D conformation of the peptide backbone.
