BACKGROUND: Clinical drawback in checkpoint inhibitors immunotherapy (ICI) of 
metastatic melanoma (MM) is monitoring clinical benefit. Soluble forms of 
PD1(sPD1) and PD-L1(sPD-L1) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) expressing PD1 and 
PD-L1 have recently emerged as predictive biomarkers of response. As factors 
released in the blood, EVs and soluble forms could be relevant in monitoring 
treatment efficacy and adaptive resistance to ICI.
METHODS: We used pre-therapy plasma samples of 110 MM patients and longitudinal 
samples of 46 patients. Elisa assay and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to 
measure sPD-L1 and sPD1 concentrations and the percentage of PD1+ EVs and PD-L1+ 
EVs, released from tumor and immune cells in patients subsets. Transwell assays 
were conducted to investigate the impact of EVs of each patient subset on MM 
cells invasion and interaction between tumor cells and macrophages or dendritic 
cells. Viability assays were performed to assess EVs effect on MM cells and 
organoids sensitivity to anti-PD1. FCM was used to investigate immunosuppressive 
markers in EVs and immune cells.
RESULTS: The concentrations of sPD1 and sPD-L1 in pre-treatment and longitudinal 
samples did not correlate with anti-PD1 response, instead only tumor-derived 
PD1+ EVs decreased in long responders while increased during disease progression 
in responders. Notably, we observed reduction of T cell derived EVs expressing 
LAG3+ and PD1+ in long responders and their increase in responders experiencing 
progression. By investigating the impact of EVs on disease progression, we found 
that those isolated from non-responders and from patients with progression 
disease accelerated tumor cells invasiveness and migration towards macrophages, 
while EVs of long responders reduced the metastatic potential of MM cells and 
neo-angiogenesis. Additionally, the EVs of non-responders and of progression 
disease patients subset reduced the sensitivity of MM cells and organoids of 
responder to anti-PD1 and the recruitment of dendritic cells, while the EVs of 
progression disease subset skewed macrophages to express higher level of PDL-1.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, we suggest that the detection of tumor-derived 
PD1 + EVs may represent a useful tool for monitoring the response to anti-PD1 
and a role for EVs shed by tumor and immune cells in promoting tumor progression 
and immune dysfunction.
