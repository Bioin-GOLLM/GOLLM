Voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels are pore-forming transmembrane proteins that 
play essential roles in excitable cells, and they are key targets for 
antiepileptic, antiarrhythmic, and analgesic drugs. We implemented a 
heterobivalent design strategy to modulate the potency, selectivity, and binding 
kinetics of NaV channel ligands. We conjugated μ-conotoxin KIIIA, which occludes 
the pore of the NaV channels, to an analogue of huwentoxin-IV, a spider-venom 
peptide that allosterically modulates channel gating. Bioorthogonal hydrazide 
and copper-assisted azide-alkyne cycloaddition conjugation chemistries were 
employed to generate heterobivalent ligands using polyethylene glycol linkers 
spanning 40-120 Å. The ligand with an 80 Å linker had the most pronounced 
bivalent effects, with a significantly slower dissociation rate and 4-24-fold 
higher potency compared to those of the monovalent peptides for the human NaV1.4 
channel. This study highlights the power of heterobivalent ligand design and 
expands the repertoire of pharmacological probes for exploring the function of 
NaV channels.
