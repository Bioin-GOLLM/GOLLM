During normal aging or neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal survival and 
function depend on protein homeostasis, which is regulated by multiple 
mechanisms, including the microRNA (miRNA) pathway. In different cells types, 
the absence of Dicer, a key miRNA processing enzyme, leads to neurodegeneration 
through cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. Loss of certain 
miRNAs also causes neurodegeneration in some model organisms. On the other hand, 
miRNA expression is misregulated in patients with different neurodegenerative 
diseases. Thus, the miRNA pathway appears to be essential in the pathogenesis of 
several age-dependent neurodegenerative conditions; however, our understanding 
of the underlying mechanism remains rudimentary. The precise causal 
relationships between specific miRNAs and neurodegeneration in humans need to be 
further investigated.
