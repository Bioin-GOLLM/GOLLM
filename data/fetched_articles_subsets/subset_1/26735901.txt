Background Peripartum cardiomyopathy shares some clinical features with 
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, a disorder caused by mutations in more than 
40 genes, including TTN, which encodes the sarcomere protein titin. Methods In 
172 women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, we sequenced 43 genes with variants 
that have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. We compared the 
prevalence of different variant types (nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) in 
these women with the prevalence of such variants in persons with dilated 
cardiomyopathy and with population controls. Results We identified 26 distinct, 
rare truncating variants in eight genes among women with peripartum 
cardiomyopathy. The prevalence of truncating variants (26 in 172 [15%]) was 
significantly higher than that in a reference population of 60,706 persons 
(4.7%, P=1.3×10(-7)) but was similar to that in a cohort of patients with 
dilated cardiomyopathy (55 of 332 patients [17%], P=0.81). Two thirds of 
identified truncating variants were in TTN, as seen in 10% of the patients and 
in 1.4% of the reference population (P=2.7×10(-10)); almost all TTN variants 
were located in the titin A-band. Seven of the TTN truncating variants were 
previously reported in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In a 
clinically well-characterized cohort of 83 women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, 
the presence of TTN truncating variants was significantly correlated with a 
lower ejection fraction at 1-year follow-up (P=0.005). Conclusions The 
distribution of truncating variants in a large series of women with peripartum 
cardiomyopathy was remarkably similar to that found in patients with idiopathic 
dilated cardiomyopathy. TTN truncating variants were the most prevalent genetic 
predisposition in each disorder.
