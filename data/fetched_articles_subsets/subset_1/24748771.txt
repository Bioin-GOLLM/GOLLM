Thyroid cancers are the most frequent neoplasms of the endocrine system and in 
the initial stages their prognosis is excellent. However, few therapeutic 
options are available for advanced or metastatic disease. In the last decade, a 
better understanding of the molecular events involved in the tumorigenesis of 
thyroid cancers has led to development of new targeted agents for the management 
of advanced and refractory disease. Multikinase inhibitors that are able to 
block pathways involved in the proliferation, invasion, and neoangiogenesis of 
thyroid cancer have been the most widely studied. After an international effort 
to identify and recruit sufficient patients, four placebo-controlled studies of 
multikinase inhibitors have been completed. These trials have led to the 
approval of the first agents with activity in advanced medullary thyroid 
cancers, which will probably change the landscape of treatment for 
iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer in the near future. The purpose 
of this paper is to review the development of targeted agents for thyroid 
malignancy, with a special focus on lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor.
