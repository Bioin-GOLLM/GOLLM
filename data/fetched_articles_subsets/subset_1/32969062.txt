Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has been shown to play a critical role in 
orchestrating immune responses to various pathogens through sensing cyclic 
dinucleotides. However, how STING regulates intestinal homeostasis is still not 
completely understood. In this study, we found that STING-/- mice were more 
susceptible to enteric infection with Citrobacter rodentium compared to 
wild-type (WT) mice evidenced by more severe intestinal inflammation and 
impaired bacterial clearance. STING-/- mice demonstrated lower expression of 
REG3γ but not β-defensins and Cramp in IECs. Consistently, STING-/- IECs showed 
reduced capacity to inhibit bacterial growth. STING agonists, both 
10-carboxymethyl-9-acridanone (CMA) and 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid 
(DMXAA), promoted REG3γ expression IECs. Furthermore, STING agonists promoted WT 
but not REG3γ-deficient IEC bacterial killing. Mechanistically, STING agonists 
activated STAT3 and promoted glycolysis in IECs. Inhibition of STAT3 pathway and 
glycolysis suppressed STING-induced REG3γ production in IECs, and abrogated 
STING-mediated IEC killing of C. rodentium. Additionally, treatment with the 
STING ligand, 2,3-cGAMP, inhibited C. rodentium-induced colitis in vivo. 
Overall, STING promotes IEC REG3γ expression to inhibit enteric infection and 
intestinal inflammation, thus, maintaining the intestinal homeostasis.
