Bisphosphonates are commonly used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Atypical 
femoral fracture (AFF) is a well-known adverse effect of bisphosphonate use. The 
importance of genetic factors has been demonstrated in bone quality, bone 
turnover, and in the response to osteoporosis treatment. Herein, we present two 
cases of bilateral AFFs after bisphosphonate use for a short period of time in 
members of the same family (mother and her daughter) and discuss genetic 
predisposition to bisphosphonate-induced AFFs in the light of literature data.
