Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDIs) are promising anticancer therapies 
and have been clinically used for the treatment of hematological malignancy. 
However, their efficacy in solid tumors is marginal and drug resistance hampers 
their further clinical utility. To develop novel strategies for the HDI-based 
anticancer therapeutics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in the present 
study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying resistance to HDI treatment in 
NSCLC cells. We show the STAT3-mediated IGF2/IGF-1R signaling cascade as a key 
modulator for both acquired and primary HDI resistance. The treatment with HDI 
upregulated IGF2 transcription in NSCLC cells carrying intrinsic or acquired 
drug resistance via direct binding of STAT3 in IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters. 
Acetylated STAT3 emerged upon HDAC inhibition was protected from the 
proteasome-mediated degradation of STAT3 and functioned as a direct 
transcription factor for IGF2 expression. Genomic or pharmacological strategies 
targeting STAT3 diminished the HDI-induced IGF2 mRNA expression and overcame the 
resistance to HDI treatment in HDI-resistant NSCLC- or patient-derived tumor 
xenograft models. These findings provide new insights into the role of 
acetylated STAT3-mediated activation of IGF2 transcription in HDI resistance, 
suggesting IGF2 or STAT3 as novel targets to overcome HDI resistance in NSCLC.
