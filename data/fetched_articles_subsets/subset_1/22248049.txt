BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain shows an ongoing inflammatory 
condition and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories diminish the risk of suffering 
the neurologic disease. Cannabinoids are neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory 
agents with therapeutic potential.
METHODS: We have studied the effects of prolonged oral administration of 
transgenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) mice with two pharmacologically 
different cannabinoids (WIN 55,212-2 and JWH-133, 0.2 mg/kg/day in the drinking 
water during 4 months) on inflammatory and cognitive parameters, and on 
¹⁸F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (¹⁸FDG) uptake by positron emission tomography (PET).
RESULTS: Novel object recognition was significantly reduced in 11 month old Tg 
APP mice and 4 month administration of JWH was able to normalize this cognitive 
deficit, although WIN was ineffective. Wild type mice cognitive performance was 
unaltered by cannabinoid administration. Tg APP mice showed decreased ¹⁸FDG 
uptake in hippocampus and cortical regions, which was counteracted by oral JWH 
treatment. Hippocampal GFAP immunoreactivity and cortical protein expression was 
unaffected by genotype or treatment. In contrast, the density of Iba1 positive 
microglia was increased in Tg APP mice, and normalized following JWH chronic 
treatment. Both cannabinoids were effective at reducing the enhancement of COX-2 
protein levels and TNF-α mRNA expression found in the AD model. Increased 
cortical β-amyloid (Aβ) levels were significantly reduced in the mouse model by 
both cannabinoids. Noteworthy both cannabinoids enhanced Aβ transport across 
choroid plexus cells in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary we have shown that chronically administered cannabinoid 
showed marked beneficial effects concomitant with inflammation reduction and 
increased Aβ clearance.
