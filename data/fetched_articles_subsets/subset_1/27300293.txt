BACKGROUND: There are only few reports of pregnancy and delivery in 
non-dystrophic myotonia or periodic paralysis caused by CLCN1 or SCN4A gene 
mutations.
METHODS: We report the medical histories and personal attitudes of 5 unrelated 
German patients, 2 following autosomal recessive inheritance (case 1; most 
likely and case 2; confirmed Becker disease) and 3 following autosomal dominant 
inheritance (case 3; CLCN1 mutation, cases 4-5; SCN4A mutations), who delivered 
a total of 9 children.
RESULTS: Apart from case 5 with periodic paralysis, who had 5 early miscarriages 
and pre-eclampsia resulting in cesarean delivery, there was no evidence of 
increased obstetric complication rates, and neonatal outcome was favorable. In 
all patients, there was aggravation of myotonia or weakness in pregnancy, 
followed by a short-term improvement after delivery in cases 2 and 3. Mexiletine 
medication improved the clinical features significantly in case 2 but was unable 
to control pregnancy-related deterioration. In case 4 (and her sister) and case 
5, there was a clear disease aggravation in pregnancy resulting in 
hospitalization or repeated neurological examinations.
CONCLUSION: Pregnancy can be regarded as a strong triggering factor in inherited 
non-dystrophic myotonias and periodic paralysis, regardless of the underlying 
gene defect.
