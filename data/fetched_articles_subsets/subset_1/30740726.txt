BACKGROUND: Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency (FTCD deficiency) or 
formiminoglutamic aciduria is the second most common of the known inherited 
disorders of folate metabolism. Initial case reports suggested that patients may 
have severe intellectual disability and megaloblastic anemia. However, these 
cases were obtained from screening cohorts of patients with developmental delay. 
Subsequently, patients with milder clinical phenotypes have been reported. The 
full phenotypic spectrum of this disorder remains unknown.
METHODS: In many states, FTCD deficiency can be incidentally detected on tandem 
mass spectrometry-based newborn screening of dried blood spots. In this work, we 
report the outcomes of infants identified to have FTCD deficiency through 
newborn screening.
RESULTS: During the study period, 18 patients were identified to have FTCD 
deficiency and were referred and evaluated at one of the two participating 
metabolic centers. The overall rate of FTCD deficiency detected through the New 
Jersey screening program over the study time period was 1:58,982. At a mean age 
of 56 months at last follow-up: 3/18 (16%) had developmental delays requiring 
individualized education plans, no patients had profound intellectual 
disability; 4/16 (25%) had mild self-limited anemia, no patients had profound 
anemia.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the majority of individuals with FTCD 
deficiency detected by newborn screening are asymptomatic.
