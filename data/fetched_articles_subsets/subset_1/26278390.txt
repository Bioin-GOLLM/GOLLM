For more than 30 years, lipid droplets (LDs) were considered as an inert bag of 
lipid for storage of energy-rich fat molecules. Following a paradigm shift 
almost a decade ago, LDs are presently considered an active subcellular 
organelle especially designed for assembling, storing and subsequently supplying 
lipids for generating energy and membrane synthesis (and in the case of 
hepatocytes for VLDL secretion). LDs also play a central role in many other 
cellular functions such as viral assembly and protein degradation. Here, we have 
explored the structural and functional changes that occur in hepatic and adipose 
tissue LDs following chronic ethanol consumption in relation to their role in 
the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury.
