Recent evidence suggests that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) proteins and 
their upstream and downstream regulators have key roles in many fundamental 
processes during neurodevelopment. Disruption of GSK3 signalling adversely 
affects brain development and is associated with several neurodevelopmental 
disorders. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which GSK3 activity is regulated 
in the nervous system and provide an overview of the recent advances in the 
understanding of how GSK3 signalling controls neurogenesis, neuronal 
polarization and axon growth during brain development. These recent advances 
suggest that GSK3 is a crucial node that mediates various cellular processes 
that are controlled by multiple signalling molecules--for example, disrupted in 
schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), partitioning defective homologue 3 (PAR3), PAR6 and Wnt 
proteins--that regulate neurodevelopment.
