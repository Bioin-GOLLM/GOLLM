22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) is a multisystem disorder caused by a 
hemizygous deletion within 22q11.2. Patients with the deletion display a wide 
range of cognitive deficits. The gene catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) 
resides in the typically deleted region of 22q11.2 and is rendered hemizygous in 
individuals affected by the 22q11DS. COMT is a critical enzyme in the 
degradation of catecholamine neurotransmitters in the brain. A functional 
polymorphism, Val158 Met, has been associated with a variety of neurocognitive 
outcomes. In this study, 159 patients with 22q11DS were analyzed for a potential 
association between intelligence quotient (IQ) and COMT genotype. We performed a 
univariate analysis for overall influence and modified our analysis to focus on 
possible differences between average, borderline, and intellectually impaired 
patients. No correlation between COMT genotype and IQ performance was found. ©
