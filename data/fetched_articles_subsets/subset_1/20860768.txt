OBJECTIVES: Non-syndromic orofacial clefts (NSOC) are the most common 
developmental disorders in human beings. Recently, two genome-wide association 
studies in European Caucasians identified three novel NSOC susceptibility loci: 
rs987525 on 8q24, rs7078160 on 10q25.3, and rs223371 on 17q22. The aim of this 
study was to determine the association of these polymorphisms with NSOC 
susceptibility and its subgroups in a Chinese Han population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, 199 NSOC patients and 210 healthy 
individuals were recruited. SNP rs987525 was not genotyped because of its low 
frequency in the study subjects. The other two polymorphisms (rs7078160 and 
rs223371) were respectively genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and Taqman-MGB assay.
RESULTS: Overall genotype distributions of rs7078160 and rs223371 polymorphisms 
were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. The allele and genotype 
frequencies of the two polymorphisms were not significantly different between 
cases and controls. Further analysis indicated that none of the genotypes was 
associated with increased risk of NSOC. Similar results were also found when all 
cleft cases were stratified by cleft types.
CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with a lack of involvement of the 
rs7078160 and rs223371 polymorphisms in the development of NSOC in the Chinese 
Han population.
