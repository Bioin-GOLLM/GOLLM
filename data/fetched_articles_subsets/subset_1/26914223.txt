Genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can provide an important 
clinical marker for disease outcome and family screening. This study set out to 
validate our recently developed phenotype-based HCM genotype predictor score. 
Patients clinically diagnosed with HCM and evaluated by genetic counselors 
comprised the study cohort. Genotype score was derived based on clinical and 
echocardiographic variables. Total score was correlated with the yield of 
genetic testing. Of 564 HCM patients, 198 sought genetic testing (35 %; 55 % 
male; mean age at diagnosis, 50 ± 20 years). Of these, 101 patients (51 %) were 
genotype positive for a HCM-associated genetic mutation (55 % male; mean age at 
diagnosis, 42 ± 18 years). Cochran-Armitage analysis showed similar, 
statistically significant trends of increased yields for higher genotype scores 
for both the original and study cohort. Validated by the current study, this 
scoring system provides an easy-to-use, clinical tool to aid in determining the 
likelihood of a positive HCM genetic test.
