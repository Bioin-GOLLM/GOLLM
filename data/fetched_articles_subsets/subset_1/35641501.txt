CRISPR/Cas technologies constitute a powerful tool for genome engineering, yet 
their use in non-traditional bacteria depends on host factors or exogenous 
recombinases, which limits both efficiency and throughput. Here we mitigate 
these practical constraints by developing a widely-applicable genome engineering 
toolset for Gram-negative bacteria. The challenge is addressed by tailoring a 
CRISPR base editor that enables single-nucleotide resolution manipulations 
(C·G → T·A) with >90% efficiency. Furthermore, incorporating Cas6-mediated 
processing of guide RNAs in a streamlined protocol for plasmid assembly supports 
multiplex base editing with >85% efficiency. The toolset is adopted to construct 
and deconstruct complex phenotypes in the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida. 
Single-step engineering of an aromatic-compound production phenotype and 
multi-step deconstruction of the intricate redox metabolism illustrate the 
versatility of multiplex base editing afforded by our toolbox. Hence, this 
approach overcomes typical limitations of previous technologies and empowers 
engineering programs in Gram-negative bacteria that were out of reach thus far.
