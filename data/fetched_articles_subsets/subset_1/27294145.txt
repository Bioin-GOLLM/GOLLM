MicroRNAs have the potential to be useful biomarkers in the development of 
individualized treatment since they are easy to detect, are relatively stable 
during sample handling, and are important determinants of cellular processes 
controlling pathogenesis, progression, and response to treatment of several 
types of cancers including B-cell malignancies. miR-155 is an oncomiR with a 
crucial role in tumor initiation and development of several B-cell malignancies. 
The present review elucidates the potential of miR-155 as a diagnostic, 
prognostic, or predictive biomarker in B-cell malignancies using a systematic 
search strategy to identify relevant literature. miR-155 was upregulated in 
several malignancies compared to nonmalignant controls and overexpression of 
miR-155 was further associated with poor prognosis. Elevated expression of 
miR-155 shows potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Additionally, in vitro 
and in vivo studies suggest miR-155 as an efficient therapeutic target, 
supporting its oncogenic function. The use of inhibiting anti-miR structures 
indicates promising potential as novel anticancer therapeutics. Reports from 53 
studies prove that miR-155 has the potential to be a molecular tool in 
personalized medicine.
