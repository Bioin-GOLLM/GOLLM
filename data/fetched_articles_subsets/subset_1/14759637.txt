Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
affecting motor neurons. The majority of patients are sporadic cases, while 
5-10% of the patients have a family history of ALS (fALS). Mutations in the gene 
that encodes cytoplasmic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) have been identified 
in about 25% of fALS cases. Although the precise pathogenesis of ALS is still 
unknown, experimental studies including animal models suggest that fALS is 
caused by the toxic gain-of-function of the SOD1 mutant. We have analyzed not 
only SOD1 gene mutation by genomic sequencing, but also SOD1 mutant protein by 
liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). We 
analyzed 33 fALS patients and found 10 mutations in SOD1 gene, in which two were 
novel: Asp101His substitution in exon 4 and Gly141Glu substitution in exon 5. 
Here, we present their mass spectrometric protein analyses and clinical 
features.
