BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate molecular factors potentially related to the 
progression of gastric adenoma (GA) to gastric cancer (GC) and compare the 
mutation characteristics between GC and GA.
METHODS: We conducted custom gene panel sequencing for 135 GC-related genes and 
estimated the difference in somatic mutation profiles between 20 GC and 20 GA 
cases.
RESULTS: A total of 31 somatic mutations, including 22 missense, 3 nonsense, and 
6 frameshift mutations, were detected in 17 samples. We estimated an average of 
1.8 mutations per sample (range, 1 to 3 mutations), with 12 in GC and 5 in GA. 
GC tended to have one or more mutated genes (p = 0.0217), as well as higher 
allele frequencies of mutated genes (p = 0.0003), compared to GA. Likewise, 
known driver mutations associated with GC tumorigenesis (TP53, ERBB2, PIK3CA, 
and RNF43) were identified in half of the GC cases (50%, 10/20; p = 0.0002). 
Only the mutant burden, regardless of gene type, was retained, with an odds 
ratio of 1.8392 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0071 to 3.3588; p = 0.0474).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the accumulation of mutant burden 
contributes to tumorigenesis progression from GA to GC in Korean patients, 
regardless of the kind of genes. These findings may elucidate the molecular 
pathogenesis of gastric carcinogenesis and malignant progression.
