The Elongator complex is required for proper development of the cerebral cortex. 
Interfering with its activity in vivo delays the migration of postmitotic 
projection neurons, at least through a defective α-tubulin acetylation. However, 
this complex is already expressed by cortical progenitors where it may regulate 
the early steps of migration by targeting additional proteins. Here we report 
that connexin-43 (Cx43), which is strongly expressed by cortical progenitors and 
whose depletion impairs projection neuron migration, requires Elongator 
expression for its proper acetylation. Indeed, we show that Cx43 acetylation is 
reduced in the cortex of Elp3cKO embryos, as well as in a neuroblastoma cell 
line depleted of Elp1 expression, suggesting that Cx43 acetylation requires 
Elongator in different cellular contexts. Moreover, we show that histones 
deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a deacetylase of Cx43. Finally, we report that 
acetylation of Cx43 regulates its membrane distribution in apical progenitors of 
the cerebral cortex.
