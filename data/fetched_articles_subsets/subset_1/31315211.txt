Patterns of spontaneous electric activity in the cerebral cortex change upon 
administration of benzodiazepines. Here we are testing the hypothesis that the 
prototypical benzodiazepine, diazepam, affects spectral power density in the low 
(20-50 Hz) and high (50-90 Hz) γ-band by targeting GABAA receptors harboring α1- 
and α2-subunits. Local field potentials (LFPs) and action potentials were 
recorded in the barrel cortex of wild type mice and two mutant strains in which 
the drug exclusively acted via GABAA receptors containing either α1- (DZα1-mice) 
or α2-subunits (DZα2-mice). In wild type mice, diazepam enhanced low γ-power. 
This effect was also evident in DZα2-mice, while diazepam decreased low γ-power 
in DZα1-mice. Diazepam increased correlated local LFP-activity in wild type 
animals and DZα2- but not in DZα1-mice. In all genotypes, spectral power density 
in the high γ-range and multi-unit action potential activity declined upon 
diazepam administration. We conclude that diazepam modifies low γ-power in 
opposing ways via α1- and α2-GABAA receptors. The drug's boosting effect 
involves α2-receptors and an increase in local intra-cortical synchrony. 
Furthermore, it is important to make a distinction between high- and low γ-power 
when evaluating the effects of drugs that target GABAA receptors.
