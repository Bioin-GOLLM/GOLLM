Recent advances in genomics-based technology have resulted in an increase in our 
understanding of the molecular basis of many primary immune deficiencies. Along 
with this increased knowledge comes an increased responsibility to understand 
the underlying mechanism of disease, and thus increasingly sophisticated 
technologies are being used to investigate the cell biology of human immune 
deficiencies. One such technology, which has itself undergone a recent explosion 
in innovation, is that of high-resolution microscopy and image analysis. These 
advances complement innovative studies that have previously shed light on 
critical cell biological processes that are perturbed by single-gene mutations 
in primary immune deficiency. Here we highlight advances made specifically in 
the following cell biological processes: (1) cytoskeletal-related processes; (2) 
cell signaling; (3) intercellular trafficking; and (4) cellular host defense.
