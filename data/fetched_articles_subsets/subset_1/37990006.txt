Choline is an essential nutrient, and its deficiency causes steatohepatitis. 
Dietary phosphatidylcholine (PC) is digested into lysoPC (LPC), 
glycerophosphocholine, and choline in the intestinal lumen and is the primary 
source of systemic choline. However, the major PC metabolites absorbed in the 
intestinal tract remain unidentified. ATP8B1 is a P4-ATPase phospholipid 
flippase expressed in the apical membrane of the epithelium. Here, we use 
intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific Atp8b1-knockout (Atp8b1IEC-KO) mice. 
These mice progress to steatohepatitis by 4 weeks. Metabolomic analysis and 
cell-based assays show that loss of Atp8b1 in IEC causes LPC malabsorption and 
thereby hepatic choline deficiency. Feeding choline-supplemented diets to 
lactating mice achieves complete recovery from steatohepatitis in Atp8b1IEC-KO 
mice. Analysis of samples from pediatric patients with ATP8B1 deficiency 
suggests its translational potential. This study indicates that Atp8b1 regulates 
hepatic choline levels through intestinal LPC absorption, encouraging the 
evaluation of choline supplementation therapy for steatohepatitis caused by 
ATP8B1 dysfunction.
