Ageing is associated with the functional decline of all tissues and a striking 
increase in many diseases. Although ageing has long been considered a one-way 
street, strategies to delay and potentially even reverse the ageing process have 
recently been developed. Here, we review four emerging rejuvenation 
strategies-systemic factors, metabolic manipulations, senescent cell ablation 
and cellular reprogramming-and discuss their mechanisms of action, cellular 
targets, potential trade-offs and application to human ageing.
