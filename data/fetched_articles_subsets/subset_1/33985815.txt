G protein-coupled angiotensin II receptors, AT1R and AT2R, are integral 
components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that regulates blood pressure 
and fluid balance in humans. While AT1R is a well-established target of 
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for managing hypertension and a prime 
system for studying biased signaling, AT2R has been recognized as a promising 
target against neuropathic pain and lung fibrosis. In this review, we discuss 
how recent structural advances illuminate ligand-binding modes and subtype 
selectivity, shared and distinct features of the receptors, their 
transducer-coupling patterns, and downstream signaling responses. We also 
underscore the key ATR aspects that require further studies to fully appreciate 
the mechanistic framework that fine-tunes their cellular and physiological 
functions, providing untapped potential for drug discovery.
