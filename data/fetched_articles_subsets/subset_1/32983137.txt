Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have become one of the most important classes of 
biopharmaceutical products, and they continue to dominate the universe of 
biopharmaceutical markets in terms of approval and sales. They are the most 
profitable single product class, where they represent six of the top ten selling 
drugs. At the beginning of the 1990s, an in vitro antibody selection technology 
known as antibody phage display was developed by John McCafferty and Sir. 
Gregory Winter that enabled the discovery of human antibodies for diverse 
applications, particularly antibody-based drugs. They created combinatorial 
antibody libraries on filamentous phage to be utilized for generating antigen 
specific antibodies in a matter of weeks. Since then, more than 70 phage-derived 
antibodies entered clinical studies and 14 of them have been approved. These 
antibodies are indicated for cancer, and non-cancer medical conditions, such as 
inflammatory, optical, infectious, or immunological diseases. This review will 
illustrate the utility of phage display as a powerful platform for therapeutic 
antibodies discovery and describe in detail all the approved mAbs derived from 
phage display.
