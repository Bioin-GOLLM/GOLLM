Mitochondrial disease can present with a wide range of clinical phenotypes, and 
knowledge of the clinical spectrum of mitochondrial DNA mutation is constantly 
expanding. Leigh syndrome (LS) has been reported to be caused by the m.13513G>A 
mutation in the ND5 subunit of complex I (MT-ND5 m.13513G>A). We present a case 
of a 12-month-old infant initially diagnosed with tachyarrhythmia requiring 
defibrillation, subsequent presentation with hypertension and hyponatraemia 
secondary to renal salt loss and presumed inappropriate ADH secretion. Complex I 
activity in the muscle tissue was 54%, and mutation load in the muscle and 
lymphocytes was 50%. This case of Leigh syndrome caused by the m.13513G>A 
mutation in the ND5 gene illustrates that hyponatraemia due to renal sodium loss 
and inappropriate ADH secretion and hypertension can be features of this entity 
in addition to the previously reported cardiomyopathy and WPW-like conduction 
pattern and that they present additional challenges in diagnosis and management.
