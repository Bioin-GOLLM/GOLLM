BACKGROUND: A recent study suggested a link between folate metabolism and atopy, 
based on a positive association between a common polymorphism of the 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and allergic sensitization in 
Danish adults.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the associations between MTHFR C677T and allergy or 
atopy in a large, population-based birth cohort of children and their mothers, 
the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We also looked for 
evidence of a pre-natal effect of maternal folate metabolism on subsequent 
atopic disease in the offspring.
METHODS: Mothers were recruited in pregnancy and the children followed from 
birth. Atopy in the child was assessed at 7-8 years of age by skin prick tests 
to common allergens. Asthma was defined as a physician diagnosis and current 
symptoms at 71/2 years of age. Asthma and allergy status of the mothers were 
obtained from self-completion questionnaires.
RESULTS: Data on MTHFR C677T genotype and allergy were available for 5364 
children and on allergy and/or asthma for 7356 mothers. In children, the 
prevalence of atopy was 20.0% and asthma 10.0% whereas in mothers, the 
prevalence of self-reported allergy was 42.7% and asthma 11.5%. Atopy in the 
child was associated with male gender (P<0.001), less tobacco smoke exposure and 
higher maternal education. MTHFR C677T genotype was not associated with social 
factors or dietary folate intake. We found no evidence of associations between 
the MTHFR C677T variant allele and atopy, allergy or asthma in mothers or 
children. There was no evidence to support an effect of maternal MTHFR C677T 
genotype on atopy in the offspring.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that 
impaired folate metabolism is associated with allergy in adults or children in 
this population.
