In vertebrates, activation of innate immunity is an early response to injury, 
implicating it in the regenerative process. However, the mechanisms by which 
innate signals might regulate stem cell functionality are unknown. Here, we 
demonstrate that type 2 innate immunity is required for regeneration of skeletal 
muscle after injury. Muscle damage results in rapid recruitment of eosinophils, 
which secrete IL-4 to activate the regenerative actions of muscle resident 
fibro/adipocyte progenitors (FAPs). In FAPs, IL-4/IL-13 signaling serves as a 
key switch to control their fate and functions. Activation of IL-4/IL-13 
signaling promotes proliferation of FAPs to support myogenesis while inhibiting 
their differentiation into adipocytes. Surprisingly, type 2 cytokine signaling 
is also required in FAPs, but not in myeloid cells, for rapid clearance of 
necrotic debris, a process that is necessary for timely and complete 
regeneration of tissues.
