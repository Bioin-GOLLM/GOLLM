Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe malaria in humans. Immunoglobulin M 
(IgM) serves as the first line of humoral defense against infection and potently 
activates the complement pathway to facilitate P. falciparum clearance. A number 
of P. falciparum proteins bind IgM, leading to immune evasion and severe 
disease. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, 
using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy, we delineate how P. falciparum 
proteins VAR2CSA, TM284VAR1, DBLMSP, and DBLMSP2 target IgM. Each protein binds 
IgM in a different manner, and together they present a variety of 
Duffy-binding-like domain-IgM interaction modes. We further show that these 
proteins interfere directly with IgM-mediated complement activation in vitro, 
with VAR2CSA exhibiting the most potent inhibitory effect. These results 
underscore the importance of IgM for human adaptation of P. falciparum and 
provide critical insights into its immune evasion mechanism.
