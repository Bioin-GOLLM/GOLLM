A 38-year-old female patient was diagnosed with anemia for 3 years. Medical 
examination showed slight splenomegaly (250 × 62 mm), thrombocytopenia 
(platelets 51 × 109/L), anemia (Hb levels 107 g/L), and β-glucocerebrosidase 
activity (GBA) in leukocytes was lower than normal. Microscopic findings of bone 
marrow smear demonstrated that Gaucher cells in bone marrow and periodic 
acid-Schiff staining of them were positive. Sequencing of GBA genomic and cDNA 
identified one novel homozygous mutation, c.484A> G (p.Met162Val). This case 
suggests that we should pay attention to adult Gaucher disease as a differential 
diagnosis for cryptogenic thrombocytopenia and one novel homozygous mutation in 
GBA gene was reported for the first time. The novel mutation in homozygosity is 
apparently associated with mild, non-neuronopathic type 1 disease which is 
relatively uncommon in Asian populations.
