Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a signaling molecule with many beneficial effects. 
However, its cellular concentration is strictly regulated to avoid toxicity. 
Persulfide dioxygenase (PDO or ETHE1) is a mononuclear non-heme iron-containing 
protein in the sulfide oxidation pathway catalyzing the conversion of GSH 
persulfide (GSSH) to sulfite and GSH. PDO mutations result in the 
autosomal-recessive disorder ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE). Here, we 
developed γ-glutamyl-homocysteinyl-glycine (GHcySH), in which the cysteinyl 
moiety in GSH is substituted with homocysteine, as a mechanism-based PDO 
inhibitor. Human PDO used GHcySH as an alternative substrate and converted it to 
GHcy-SO2H, mimicking GS-SO2H, the putative oxygenated intermediate formed with 
the natural substrate. Because GHcy-SO2H contains a C-S bond rather than an S-S 
bond in GS-SO2H, it failed to undergo the final hydrolysis step in the catalytic 
cycle, leading to PDO inhibition. We also characterized the biochemical 
penalties incurred by the L55P, T136A, C161Y, and R163W mutations reported in EE 
patients. The variants displayed lower iron content (1.4-11-fold) and lower 
thermal stability (1.2-1.7-fold) than WT PDO. They also exhibited varying 
degrees of catalytic impairment; the kcat/Km values for R163W, L55P, and C161Y 
PDOs were 18-, 42-, and 65-fold lower, respectively, and the T136A variant was 
most affected, with a 200-fold lower kcat/Km Like WT enzyme, these variants were 
inhibited by GHcySH. This study provides the first characterization of an 
intermediate in the PDO-catalyzed reaction and reports on deficits associated 
with EE-linked mutations that are distal from the active site.
