Tissue maintenance and homeostasis can be achieved through the replacement of 
dying cells by differentiating precursors or self-renewal of terminally 
differentiated cells or relies heavily on cellular longevity in poorly 
regenerating tissues. Regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells) represent an actively 
dividing cell population with critical function in suppression of lethal 
immune-mediated inflammation. The plasticity of T(reg) cells has been actively 
debated because it could factor importantly in protective immunity or 
autoimmunity. By using inducible labeling and tracking of T(reg) cell fate in 
vivo, or transfers of highly purified T(reg) cells, we have demonstrated notable 
stability of this cell population under physiologic and inflammatory conditions. 
Our results suggest that self-renewal of mature T(reg) cells serves as a major 
mechanism of maintenance of the T(reg) cell lineage in adult mice.
