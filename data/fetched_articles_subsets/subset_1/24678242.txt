The breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) has been shown to maintain 
genomic stability through multiple functions in the regulation of DNA damage 
repair and transcription. Its translated BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal domain) acts as 
a strong transcriptional activator. BRCA1 damaged by carboplatin treatment may 
lead to a loss of such functions. To address the possibility of the BRCA1 gene 
as a therapeutic target for carboplatin, we investigated the functional 
consequences of the 3'-terminal region of human BRCA1 following in vitro 
platination with carboplatin. A reduction in cellular BRCA1 repair of 
carboplatin-treated plasmid DNA, using a host cell reactivation assay, was 
dependent on the platination levels on the reporter gene. The transcriptional 
transactivation activity of the drug-modified BRCA1, assessed using a one-hybrid 
GAL4 transcriptional assay, was inversely proportional to the carboplatin doses. 
The data emphasized the potential of the BRCA1 gene to be a target for 
carboplatin treatment.
