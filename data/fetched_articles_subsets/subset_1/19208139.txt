BACKGROUND: RNA secondary structure prediction is one major task in 
bioinformatics, and various computational methods have been proposed so far. 
Pseudoknot is one of the typical substructures appearing in several RNAs, and 
plays an important role in some biological processes. Prediction of RNA 
secondary structure with pseudoknots is still challenging since the problem is 
NP-hard when arbitrary pseudoknots are taken into consideration.
RESULTS: We introduce a new method of predicting RNA secondary structure with 
pseudoknots based on integer programming. In our formulation, we aim at 
minimizing the value of the objective function that reflects free energy of a 
folding structure of an input RNA sequence. We focus on a practical class of 
pseudoknots by setting constraints appropriately. Experimental results for a set 
of real RNA sequences show that our proposed method outperforms several existing 
methods in sensitivity. Furthermore, for a set of sequences of small length, our 
approach achieved good performance in both sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSION: Our integer programming-based approach for RNA structure prediction 
is flexible and extensible.
