Fabry disease (FD) is a progressive, X-linked inherited disorder of 
glycosphingolipid metabolism due to deficient or absent lysosomal 
alpha-galactosidase A (AGALA) activity. FD and familial Mediterranean fever 
(FMF) have typical clinical similarities, and both diseases may progress to 
end-stage renal diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of 
FD in patients with FMF from Central Anatolia of Turkey. The study group 
consisted of 177 FMF patients, followed up by the Adult and Pediatric Nephrology 
Clinic of Cumhuriyet University Hospital. Screening for AGALA activity was 
performed by the dry blood spot method. Mutation analysis for GLA gene was 
carried out for patients having an AGALA enzyme activity value lower than the 
normal reference value. Low AGALA activity was detected in 23 (13 %) patients. 
Heterozygous GLA gene mutation c.[937G>T] p.[D313Y] was detected in one female 
patient (0.56 %). The patient was a 53-year-old female with proteinuria and who 
had undergone left nephrectomy; her glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 
scintigraphy was found to be 70 ml/min. She had M694V mutation and no clinical 
manifestation of FD. In our study, the prevalence rate of FD was found as 0.56 % 
in FMF patients. The similarities between the symptoms of FMF and FD might lead 
to a diagnostic dilemma in physicians at countries where FMF is observed 
frequently. Although the prevalence of FD is rare, physicians should keep in 
mind that FD has an ambiguous symptomology pattern of FMF.
