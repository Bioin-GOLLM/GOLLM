PURPOSE: The antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itraconazole reduce serum 
concentrations of 4β-hydroxycholesterol, which is a validated marker for hepatic 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 activity. We tested the effect of another antifungal 
triazole agent, fluconazole, on serum concentrations of different sterols and 
oxysterols within the cholesterol metabolism to see if this inhibitory reaction 
is a general side effect of azole antifungal agents.
METHODS: In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover 
design, we studied 17 healthy subjects (nine men, eight women) who received 
400 mg fluconazole or placebo daily for 8 days. On day 1 before treatment and on 
day 8 after the last dose, fasting blood samples were collected. Serum 
cholesterol precursors and oxysterols were measured by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry-selected ion monitoring and expressed as the ratio to cholesterol 
(R_sterol).
RESULTS: Under fluconazole treatment, serum R_lanosterol and 
R_24,25-dihydrolanosterol increased significantly without affecting serum 
cholesterol or metabolic downstream markers of hepatic cholesterol synthesis. 
Serum R_4β-, R_24S-, and R_27-hydroxycholesterol increased significantly.
CONCLUSION: Fluconazole inhibits the 14α-demethylation of lanosterol and 
24,25-dihydrolanosterol, regulated by CYP51A1, without reduction of total 
cholesterol synthesis. The increased serum level of R_4β-hydroxycholesterol 
under fluconazole treatment is in contrast to the reductions observed under 
ketoconazole and itraconazole treatments. The question, whether this increase is 
caused by induction of CYP3A4 or by inhibition of the catabolism of 
4β-hydroxycholesterol, must be answered by mechanistic in vitro and in vivo 
studies comparing effects of various azole antifungal agents on hepatic CYP3A4 
activity.
