Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive degenerative disease that affects all 
synovial joints, causing the disability of the main locomotor diarthrodial 
joints. OA pathogenesis is caused by a complex interplay between a number of 
genetic and environmental risk factors, involved in the early onset and 
progression of this chronic inflammatory joint disease. Uncovering the 
underlying immunological and genetic mechanisms will enable an insight into OA 
pathophysiology and lead to novel and integrative approaches in the treatment of 
OA patients, together with a reduction of the disease risk, or a delay of its 
onset in susceptible patients.
