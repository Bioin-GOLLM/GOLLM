INTRODUCTION: Elderly people are at increased risk of falls, disability and 
death due to reduced functional reserve, decline in multiple systems functions, 
which affects their activities of daily living (ADL) and eventually develop into 
frailty. The ADL assessment is conducive to early detection to avoid further 
serious situations. Previous studies on patients' activities of daily living 
with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are mainly focused on dialysis patients. 
Little information is available ﻿on non-dialysis patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 303 elderly patients with CKD stage 3-5 who 
were admitted to our hospital were selected. ADL evaluation was performed on 
patients at admission, with Barthel index (BI) as the evaluation tool. They were 
divided into two groups based on BI (≥60 and <60). Demographic information, 
lifestyle and clinical profile were collected. The risk factors related to ADL 
were analyzed by univariate and multivariate models.
RESULTS: The data of 303 patients enrolled in this study were analyzed. The 
average age of patients was 84.48± 7.14 years and 62.05% were male. There were 
88 patients (29.04%) in BI <60 group and 215 patients (70.96%) in the BI ≥60 
group. The average age of subjects in the two groups was 87.47 ± 5.85 years and 
83.26± 7.28 years, respectively. On univariate analysis, ADL impairment was 
associated with many factors, such as age, body mass index, blood lipid, heart 
rate, smoking history, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), hemoglobin, serum 
albumin, BNP, eGFR, etc. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (OR 
1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.17, P=0.0390), Charlson comorbidity index (OR 4.75, 95% CI 
1.17-19.30, P=0.0295), and serum albumin (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92, P=0.0012) 
were the independent risk factors of ADL impairment.
CONCLUSION: Decline of ADL in CKD patients was independently correlated with 
age, Charlson comorbidity index and serum albumin. ADL and its influential 
factors in the elderly CKD patients deserve further attention.
