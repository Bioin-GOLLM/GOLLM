Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a congenital anomaly characterized by a 
defect in the diaphragm. Despite the recent improvements in its treatment, CDH 
is associated with a high rate of neonatal mortality, which is often related to 
pulmonary hypoplasia (PH) as well as pulmonary hypertension. A better 
understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms of PH in CDH could help 
establish a new treatment to improve its prognosis. In this study, we 
investigated serum biological profiles in neonates with CDH. For comprehensive 
investigation, umbilical cord serum samples were collected from isolated CDH 
cases (n = 4) and matched healthy controls (n = 4). Samples were analyzed using 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 697 proteins were 
detected; of them, 98 were identified as differentially expressed proteins. 
Among these differentially expressed proteins, complement C1q subcomponent 
showed the largest fold change, followed by complement C5. In the pathway 
enrichment analysis, the complement and coagulation cascades expressed the most 
significant enrichment (p = 2.4 Ã— 10-26). Thus, the complement pathway might 
play some role in the pathophysiology of CDH.
