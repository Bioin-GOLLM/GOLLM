PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Following a life-threatening traumatic exposure, about 10% of 
those exposed are at considerable risk for developing posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD), a severe and disabling syndrome characterized by uncontrollable 
intrusive memories, nightmares, avoidance behaviors, and hyperarousal in 
addition to impaired cognition and negative emotion symptoms. This review will 
explore recent genetic and epigenetic approaches to PTSD that explain some of 
the differential risk following trauma exposure.
RECENT FINDINGS: A substantial portion of the variance explaining differential 
risk responses to trauma exposure may be explained by differential inherited and 
acquired genetic and epigenetic risk. This biological risk is complemented by 
alterations in the functional regulation of genes via environmentally induced 
epigenetic changes, including prior childhood and adult trauma exposure. This 
review will cover recent findings from large-scale genome-wide association 
studies as well as newer epigenome-wide studies. We will also discuss future 
"phenome-wide" studies utilizing electronic medical records as well as targeted 
genetic studies focusing on mechanistic ways in which specific genetic or 
epigenetic alterations regulate the biological risk for PTSD.
