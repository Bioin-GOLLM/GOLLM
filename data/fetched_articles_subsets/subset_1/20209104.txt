Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) homologues form a diverse superfamily 
that arose early in animal evolution and control cellular function through 
membrane-spanning, conserved serine-threonine kinases (RII and RI receptors). 
Activin and inhibin are related dimers within the TGFbeta superfamily that share 
a common beta-subunit. The evolution of the inhibin alpha-subunit created the 
only antagonist within the TGFbeta superfamily and the only member known to act 
as an endocrine hormone. This hormone introduced a new level of complexity and 
control to vertebrate reproductive function. The novel functions of the inhibin 
alpha-subunit appear to reflect specific insertion-deletion changes within the 
inhibin beta-subunit that occurred during evolution. Using phylogenomic 
analysis, we correlated specific insertions with the acquisition of distinct 
functions that underlie the phenotypic complexity of vertebrate reproductive 
processes. This phylogenomic approach presents a new way of understanding the 
structure-function relationships between inhibin, activin, and the larger 
TGFbeta superfamily.
