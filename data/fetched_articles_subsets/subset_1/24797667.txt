Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone regulating renal 
phosphate reabsorption and vitamin D synthesis in renal proximal tubules. Here, 
we show that FGF23 directly regulates the membrane abundance of the Na(+):Cl(-) 
co-transporter NCC in distal renal tubules by a signaling mechanism involving 
the FGF receptor/αKlotho complex, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 
(ERK1/2), serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), and with-no lysine 
kinase-4 (WNK4). Renal sodium (Na(+)) reabsorption and distal tubular membrane 
expression of NCC are reduced in mouse models of Fgf23 and αKlotho deficiency. 
Conversely, gain of FGF23 function by injection of wild-type mice with 
recombinant FGF23 or by elevated circulating levels of endogenous Fgf23 in Hyp 
mice increases distal tubular Na(+) uptake and membrane abundance of NCC, 
leading to volume expansion, hypertension, and heart hypertrophy in a αKlotho 
and dietary Na(+)-dependent fashion. The NCC inhibitor chlorothiazide abrogates 
FGF23-induced volume expansion and heart hypertrophy. Our findings suggest that 
FGF23 is a key regulator of renal Na(+) reabsorption and plasma volume, and may 
explain the association of FGF23 with cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney 
disease patients.
