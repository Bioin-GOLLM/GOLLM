OBJECTIVE: To determine whether inherited and acquired thrombophilias are 
associated with adverse obstetric complications.
STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review; studies where women with adverse obstetric 
complications were tested for one or more acquired and inherited thrombophilias 
were included.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of thrombophilia in women with severe 
pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, severe placental abruption, intrauterine growth 
restriction or unexplained stillbirth.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, placental abruption was more often associated 
with homozygous and heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, heterozygous G20210A 
prothrombin gene mutation, homocysteinaemia, activated protein C resistance or 
anticardiolipin IgG antibodies. Women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia were more 
likely to have heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, heterozygous G20210A 
prothrombin gene mutation, homozygous MTHFR C677T mutation, protein C 
deficiency, protein S deficiency or activated protein C resistance compared with 
controls. Unexplained stillbirth, when compared with controls, was more often 
associated with heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, protein S deficiency, 
activated protein C resistance, anticardiolipin IgG antibodies or lupus 
anticoagulant. Women with intrauterine growth restriction had a higher 
prevalence of heterozygous G20210A prothrombin gene mutation, homozygous MTHFR 
C677T gene mutation, protein S deficiency or anticardiolipin IgG antibodies than 
controls. There was wide heterogeneity in the prevalence of thrombophilia 
between the studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with adverse pregnancy outcome are more likely to have a 
positive thrombophilia screen but studies published so far are too small to 
adequately assess the true size of this association. Screening for thrombophilia 
should not become standard practice until clear evidence emerges that 
thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy improves perinatal outcome. Further research 
into the link between the observed association, causality and heterogeneity is 
required.
