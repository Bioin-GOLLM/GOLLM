Disruption of nitric oxide pathway and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress had 
been observed in preeclampsia (PE). However, the correlation and overall 
detailed expression profiles of ER stress-related markers and endothelial nitric 
oxide synthase/inducible nitric oxide synthase (eNOS/iNOS) in patients with PE 
were poorly understood. In this study, placental protein expression of ER 
stress-related markers as well as eNOS/iNOS in normotensive control (n=32) and 
PE pregnancies (n=32) was examined by western blot. In addition, apoptosis was 
detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labelling 
(TUNEL) staining in placentas. Compared with control, we found elevated ER 
stress response was agreeable with iNOS upregulation in placenta tissue of PE 
patients. Placental protein expression of ER stress-related markers, including 
GRP78, GRP94, p-PERK, eIF2a, p-eIF2a, XBP1, CHOP, Ire1, p-Ire1 and iNOS, was 
higher, and eNOS expression was lower in PE (P<0.05 for all); however, the 
expression of ATF6 and PERK was similar in the PE and control groups. 
Upregulation of CHOP and iNOS was consistent of apoptosis increasing indicated 
by TUNEL staining and caspase 4 expression upregulation in PE placenta. Our 
datas suggest that the exaggerated ER stress response and upregulated iNOS are 
probably associated with increased apoptosis in placenta of PE patients and may 
contribute to the pathophysiology of PE.
