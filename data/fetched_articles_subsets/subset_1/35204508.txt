Endometriosis is a common chronic gynaecological disease causing various 
symptoms, such as infertility and chronic pain. The gold standard for its 
diagnosis is still laparoscopy and the biopsy of endometriotic lesions. Here, we 
aimed to compare the eutopic endometrium from women with or without 
endometriosis to identify proteins that may be considered as potential biomarker 
candidates. Eutopic endometrium was collected from patients with endometriosis 
(n = 4) and women without endometriosis (n = 5) during a laparoscopy surgery 
during the mid-secretory phase of their menstrual cycle. Total proteins from 
tissues were extracted and digested before LC-MS-MS analysis. Among the 5301 
proteins identified, 543 were differentially expressed and enriched in two 
specific KEGG pathways: focal adhesion and PI3K/AKT signaling. Integration of 
our data with a large-scale proteomics dataset allowed us to highlight 11 
proteins that share the same trend of dysregulation in eutopic endometrium, 
regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle. Our results constitute the first 
step towards the identification of potential promising endometrial diagnostic 
biomarkers. They provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying 
endometriosis and its etiology. Our results await further confirmation on a 
larger sample cohort.
