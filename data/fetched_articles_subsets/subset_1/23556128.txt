This review deals with the application of the pulsed electron double resonance 
(PELDOR) method to studies of spin-labeled DNA and RNA with complicated spatial 
structures, such as tetramers, aptamers, riboswitches, and three- and four-way 
junctions. The use of this method for studying DNA damage sites is also 
described.
