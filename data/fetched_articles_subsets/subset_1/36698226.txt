BACKGROUND: The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune mechanism for bacteria 
and archaea to resist foreign invasion. Currently, Cas9 and Cpf1 have been 
widely studied and applied in gene editing. C2c1 is a newly discovered 
CRISPR-Cas system endonuclease. It has broad application prospects due to its 
small molecular weight and high substrate recognition specificity.
OBJECTIVES: Bacillus thermoamylovorans C2c1(BthC2c1) was expressed in E. coli 
C43 (DE3) competent cells, purified, and the BthC2c1-sgRNA-dsDNA complex was 
assembled. The effect of temperature on the cleavage ability of the BthC2c1 
system was investigated.
METHODS: The cDNA of BthC2c1 was cloned into the vector pGEX-6P-1. BthC2c1 was 
expressed in E. coli C43(DE3) cells and purified using a GST affinity column and 
FPLC. The sgRNAs were transcribed and purified in vitro, and the complexes were 
assembled by gel filtration chromatography. The enzyme cleavage activity of 
BthC2c1 at different temperatures was investigated using an in vitro cleavage 
assay. Microscale Thermophoresis detected the affinity of the BthC2c1-sgRNA 
complexes to substrate DNA.
RESULTS: BthC2c1 proteins were prokaryotically expressed and purified. The 
complex of BthC2c1 with sgRNA and dsDNA was assembled. In vitro cleavage assay 
results showed that BthC2c1 cleaved the target DNA at temperatures ranging from 
37°C to 67°C. The cleavage ability of BthC2c1 at 42oC was stronger than that at 
37oC. The results of affinity detection showed that the affinity between the 
BthC2c1-sgRNA complex and ds36/36 at 42oC was stronger than that at 37oC.
CONCLUSION: In this study, BthC2c1 was expressed, purified, and assembled into a 
complex with sgRNA and dsDNA. BthC2c1 cleaved DNA within the temperature range 
of 37oC to 67oC. The affinity of BthC2c1-sgRNA to DNA at 42°C was significantly 
enhanced than that at 37°C. It may be related to its stringent substrate 
recognition pattern, which differs from Cas9 and Cpf1. The temperature-dependent 
affinity changes of substrate binding may be part of the reason for the stronger 
cleavage activity of BthC2c1 at 42oC. This study may provide an experimental 
basis for optimizing and modifying the C2c1 gene editing system.
