Antibodies against the conserved stalk domain of the hemagglutinin are currently 
being discussed as promising therapeutic tools against influenza virus 
infections. Because of the conservation of the stalk domain these antibodies are 
able to broadly neutralize a wide spectrum of influenza virus strains and 
subtypes. Broadly protective vaccine candidates based on the epitopes of these 
antibodies, for example, chimeric and headless hemagglutinin structures, are 
currently under development and show promising results in animals models. These 
candidates could be developed into universal influenza virus vaccines that 
protect from infection with drifted seasonal as well as novel pandemic influenza 
virus strains therefore obviating the need for annual vaccination, and enhancing 
our pandemic preparedness.
