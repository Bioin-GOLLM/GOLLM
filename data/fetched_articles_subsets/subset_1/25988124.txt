BACKGROUND: Serum lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) positively correlate with 
macular pigment optical density (MPOD); hence, the latter is a valuable indirect 
tool for measuring L and Z content in the macula. L and Z have been attributed 
antioxidant capacity and protection from certain retinal diseases but their 
uptake within the eye is thought to depend on genetic, age, and environmental 
factors. In particular, gene variants within beta-carotene monooxygenase (BCMO1) 
are thought to modulate MPOD in the macula.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of BCMO1 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) rs11645428, rs6420424, and rs6564851 on MPOD in a cohort of young healthy 
participants of Caucasian origin with normal ocular health.
DESIGN: In this cohort study, MPOD was assessed in 46 healthy participants (22 
male and 24 female) with a mean age of 23.8 ± 4.0 years (range 19-33). The three 
SNPs, rs11645428, rs6420424, rs6564851 that have established associations with 
MPOD were determined using MassEXTEND (hME) Sequenom assay. One-way analysis of 
variance was performed on groups segregated into homozygous and heterozygous 
BCMO1 genotypes. Correlations between body mass index (BMI), iris color, gender, 
central retinal thickness (CRT), diet, and MPOD were investigated.
RESULTS: Macular pigment optical density neither significantly varied with BCMO1 
rs11645428 (F 2,41 = 0.70, p = 0.503), rs6420424 (F 2,41 = 0.21, p = 0.801) nor 
rs6464851 homozygous or heterozygous genotypes (F 2,41 = 0,13, p = 0.88), in 
this young healthy cohort. The combination of these three SNPs into triple 
genotypes based on plasma conversion efficiency did not affect MPOD (F 
2,41 = 0.07, p = 0.9). There was a significant negative correlation with MPOD 
and CRT (r = -0.39, p = 0.01) but no significant correlation between BMI, iris 
color, gender, and MPOD.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that macular pigment deposition within the 
central retina is not dependent on BCMO1 gene variants in young healthy people. 
We propose that MPOD is saturated in younger persons and/or other gene variant 
combinations determine its deposition.
