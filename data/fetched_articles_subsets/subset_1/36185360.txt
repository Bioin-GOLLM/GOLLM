After demyelinating insult, the neuronal progenitors of the adult mouse 
sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) called neuroblasts convert into oligodendrocytes that 
participate to the remyelination process. We use this rare example of 
spontaneous fate conversion to identify the molecular mechanisms governing these 
processes. Using in vivo cell lineage and single cell RNA-sequencing, we 
demonstrate that SVZ neuroblasts fate conversion proceeds through formation of a 
non-proliferating transient cellular state co-expressing markers of both 
neuronal and oligodendrocyte identities. Transition between the two identities 
starts immediately after demyelination and occurs gradually, by a stepwise 
upregulation/downregulation of key TFs and chromatin modifiers. Each step of 
this fate conversion involves fine adjustments of the transcription and 
translation machineries as well as tight regulation of metabolism and migratory 
behaviors. Together, these data constitute the first in-depth analysis of a 
spontaneous cell fate conversion in the adult mammalian CNS.
