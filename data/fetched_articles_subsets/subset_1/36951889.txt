Diet profoundly influences brain physiology, but how metabolic information is 
transmuted into neural activity and behavior changes remains elusive. Here, we 
show that the metabolic enzyme O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) moonlights on the 
chromatin of the D. melanogaster gustatory neurons to instruct changes in 
chromatin accessibility and transcription that underlie sensory adaptations to a 
high-sugar diet. OGT works synergistically with the Mitogen Activated 
Kinase/Extracellular signal Regulated Kinase (MAPK/ERK) rolled and its effector 
stripe (also known as EGR2 or Krox20) to integrate activity information. OGT 
also cooperates with the epigenetic silencer Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.1 
(PRC2.1) to decrease chromatin accessibility and repress transcription in the 
high-sugar diet. This integration of nutritional and activity information 
changes the taste neurons' responses to sugar and the flies' ability to sense 
sweetness. Our findings reveal how nutrigenomic signaling generates neural 
activity and behavior in response to dietary changes in the sensory neurons.
