Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are 
malignancies characterized by the dependence on B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling 
and by the high expression of ROR1, the cell surface receptor for Wnt-5a. Both, 
BCR and ROR1 are therapeutic targets in these diseases and the understanding of 
their mutual cross talk is thus of direct therapeutic relevance. In this study 
we analyzed the role of Lyn, a kinase from the Src family participating in BCR 
signaling, as a mediator of the BCR-ROR1 crosstalk. We confirm the functional 
interaction between Lyn and ROR1 and demonstrate that Lyn kinase efficiently 
phosphorylates ROR1 in its kinase domain and aids the recruitment of the E3 
ligase c-CBL. We show that ROR1 surface dynamics in migrating primary CLL cells 
as well as chemotactic properties of CLL cells were inhibited by Lyn inhibitor 
dasatinib. Our data establish Lyn-mediated phosphorylation of ROR1 as a point of 
crosstalk between BCR and ROR1 signaling pathways.
