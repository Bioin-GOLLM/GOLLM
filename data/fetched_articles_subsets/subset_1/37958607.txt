Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the most common malignancies among women 
worldwide. Breast cancer shows metastatic heterogeneity with priority to 
different organs, which leads to differences in prognosis and response to 
therapy among patients. The main targets for metastasis in BC are the bone, 
lung, liver and brain. The molecular mechanism of BC organ-specificity is still 
under investigation. In recent years, the appearance of new genomic approaches 
has led to unprecedented changes in the understanding of breast cancer 
metastasis organ-specificity and has provided a new platform for the development 
of more effective therapeutic agents. This review summarises recent data on 
molecular organ-specific markers of metastasis as the basis of a possible 
therapeutic approach in order to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of patients 
with metastatically heterogeneous breast cancer.
