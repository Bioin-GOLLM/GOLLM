We measured concentrations of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B virus, respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV), mpox virus, human metapneumovirus, norovirus GII, and 
pepper mild mottle virus nucleic acids in wastewater solids at twelve wastewater 
treatment plants in Central California, USA. Measurements were made daily for up 
to two years, depending on the wastewater treatment plant. Measurements were 
made using digital droplet (reverse-transcription-) polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) following best practices for making environmental molecular biology 
measurements. These data can be used to better understand disease occurrence in 
communities contributing to the wastewater.
