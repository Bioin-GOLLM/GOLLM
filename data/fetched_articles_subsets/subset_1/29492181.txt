BACKGROUND: Causative variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are well-established risk 
factors for breast and ovarian cancer. In Poland, the causative founder variants 
in the BRCA1 are responsible for a significant proportion of ovarian cancer 
cases, however, regional differences in the frequencies of various mutations may 
exist. The spectrum and frequency of BRCA1/2 mutations between ovarian cancer 
patients have not yet been studied in the region of South-East Poland.
METHODS: We examined 158 consecutive unselected cases of ovarian cancer patients 
from the region of Podkarpacie. We studied 13 Polish causative founder variants 
in BRCA1 (c.5266dupC, c.4035delA, c.5251C > T, c.181 T > G, c.676delT, 
c.68_69delAG, c.3700_3704delGTAAA, c.1687C > T, c.3756_3759delGTCT) and in BRCA2 
(c.658_659delGT, c.7910_7914delCCTTT, c.3847_3848delGT, c.5946delT).
RESULTS: A BRCA1 causative founder variants were detected in 10 of the 158 
(6.3%) ovarian cancer cases. BRCA2 causative founder variants were not observed. 
The c.5266dupC mutation was detected in 6 patients, c.181 T > G mutation in 3 
patients and the c.676delT mutation in 1 patient. The median age of diagnosis of 
the 10 hereditary ovarian cancers was 55.5 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of 13 causative founder variants in Podkarpacie was 
lower than in other regions of Poland. Testing of three BRCA1 mutations 
(c.5266dupC, c.181 T > G, c.676delT) should be considered a sensitive test 
panel.
