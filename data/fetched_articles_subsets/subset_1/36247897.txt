BACKGROUND: Genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is generally 
considered an ion channelopathy. To date, there have been few studies on 
inflammation associated with various types of epilepsy, and it remains unclear 
whether the inflammatory mechanism plays a key role in epilepsy.
METHODS: In order to explore the role of the regulatory mechanism of immune 
factor expression in the pathogenesis of GEFS+, the present study detected the 
expression level of relevant immune factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) in 
peripheral blood of GEFS+ mice.
RESULTS: The cluster of differentiation 4+/cluster of differentiation 8+ 
(CD4+/CD8+) ratio in the GEFS+ mice was decreased, while the signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was also activated and the IL-6 was 
upregulated. Inhibit of STAT3 can lead to the GEFS+ asymptomatically due to the 
downregulated IL-6, IL-1Î², and complement factor H (CFH) levels. Suppression of 
STAT3 can also inhibited the epileptic seizures, the CD8+ T cells were declined 
after the IL-6 was neutralized.
CONCLUSIONS: The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the effect of 
STAT3 expression and activation differences on GEFS+ attack, and to clarify the 
relationship between various cytokines and GEFS+ outbreak. Inhibiting the 
expression of pro-inflammatory factors can further prevent GEFS+ attack, which 
supports that IL-6 is one of the important factors that aggravate the clinical 
symptoms of GEFS+. We expected to provide a theoretical basis for 
immunosuppressive therapy of GEFS+ and a new way for its clinical treatment.
