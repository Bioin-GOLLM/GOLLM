OBJECTIVE: Here we investigate ganglion cell physiology in healthy and 
degenerating retina to test its influence on threshold to electrical 
stimulation.
APPROACH: Age-related Macular Degeneration and Retinitis Pigmentosa cause 
blindness via outer retinal degeneration. Inner retinal pathways that transmit 
visual information to the central brain remain intact, so direct electrical 
stimulation from prosthetic devices offers the possibility for visual 
restoration. Since inner retinal physiology changes during degeneration, we 
characterize physiological properties and responses to electrical stimulation in 
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of both wild type mice and the rd10 mouse model of 
retinal degeneration.
MAIN RESULTS: Our aggregate results support previous observations that elevated 
thresholds characterize diseased retinas. However, a physiology-driven 
classification scheme reveals distinct sub-populations of ganglion cells with 
thresholds either normal or strongly elevated compared to wild-type. When these 
populations are combined, only a weakly elevated threshold with large variance 
is observed. The cells with normal threshold are more depolarized at rest and 
exhibit periodic oscillations.
SIGNIFICANCE: During degeneration, physiological changes in RGCs affect the 
threshold stimulation currents required to evoke action potentials.
