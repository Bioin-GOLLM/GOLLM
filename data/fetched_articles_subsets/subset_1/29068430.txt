In the pathogenesis of psoriasis, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress 
play mutual roles interrelated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). This study aims 
to map the selected markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP)), 
oxidative damage to nucleic acids (DNA/RNA damage; 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, 
8-hydroxyguanosine, and 8-hydroxyguanine), and the parameters of MetS (waist 
circumference, fasting glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol, diastolic and systolic blood pressure) in a group of 37 patients 
with psoriasis (62% of MetS) and in 43 healthy controls (42% of MetS). Levels of 
CRP, DNA/RNA damage, fasting glucose, and triglycerides were significantly 
elevated in patients. MetS in conjunction with psoriasis was associated with 
high levels of CRP, significantly higher than in control subjects without MetS. 
Patients with MetS exhibited further DNA/RNA damage, which was significantly 
higher in comparison with the control group. Our study supports the independent 
role of psoriasis and MetS in the increase of CRP and DNA/RNA damage. The 
psoriasis contributes to an increase in the levels of both effects more 
significantly than MetS. The psoriasis also diminished the relationship between 
CRP and oxidative damage to nucleic acids existent in controls.
