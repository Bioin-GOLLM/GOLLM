Multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) systems have been intensively 
implemented in Japanese Black cattle in Japan and to create Japanese Black herds 
out of these areas. Environmental conditions influence MOET efficiency. Thus, we 
describe results of 137 in vivo, non-surgical embryo flushings performed between 
2016-2020, in a full-blood Japanese Black herd kept in Spain and the possible 
effects of heat, year, bull, donor genetic value, and metabolic condition. 
Additionally, 687 embryo transfers were studied for conception rate (CR) and 
recipient related factors. A total of 71.3% of viable embryos (724/1015) were 
obtained (5.3 ± 4.34/flushing). Donor metabolites did not affect embryo 
production (p > 0.1), although metabolite differences were observed over the 
years, and by flushing order, probably related to the donor age. CR was not 
affected by embryo type (fresh vs. frozen), recipient breed, and whether 
suckling or not suckling (p > 0.1). CR decreased significantly with heat (44.3 
vs. 49.2%; (p = 0.042)) and numerically increased with recipient parity and 
ET-number. Pregnant recipients showed significantly higher levels of 
cholesterol-related metabolites, glucose, and urea (p < 0.05). Therefore, 
adequate MOET efficiency can be achieved under these conditions, and heat stress 
should be strongly avoided during Japanese Black embryo transfers. Moreover, 
recipients' metabolites are important to achieve pregnancy, being probably 
related to better nutrient availability during pregnancy.
