BACKGROUND: To compare early visual changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) patients with healthy controls in a baseline exploration, to follow-up the 
patients after 6 months, and to correlate these visual changes with neurological 
disability.
METHODS: All patients underwent a comprehensive neurological and 
ophthalmological examination. A linear mixed analysis and Bonferroni p-value 
correction were performed, testing four comparisons as follows: Control baseline 
vs. control follow-up, control baseline vs. ALS baseline, control follow-up vs. 
ALS follow-up, and ALS baseline vs. ALS follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean time from the diagnosis was 10.80 ± 5.5 months. The analysis 
of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed: (1) In ALS baseline vs. 
control baseline, a macular significantly increased thickness of the inner 
macular ring temporal and inferior areas; (2) in ALS follow-up vs. ALS baseline, 
a significant macular thinning in the inner and outer macular ring inferior 
areas; (3) in ALS follow-up vs. ALS baseline, a significant peripapillary 
retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thinning in the superior and inferior 
quadrants; and (4) ALS patients showed a moderate correlation between some OCT 
pRNFL parameters and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating 
Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score.
CONCLUSION: The OCT showed retinal changes in patients with motoneuron disease 
and could serve as a complementary tool for studying ALS.
