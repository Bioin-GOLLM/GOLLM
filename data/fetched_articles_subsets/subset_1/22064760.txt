BACKGROUND: The recurrent pregnancy loss requires careful consideration of 
genetic, anatomic, endocrine, infectious and immunological factors. Cytokine 
gene polymorphisms in the promoter regions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and 
interleukin (IL)-10 are associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.
AIM: The aim of present study was to investigate the association of the IL-10 
-592C/A and TNF-α-308 G/A, promoter polymorphisms among women with at least 
three consecutive miscarriages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genotyping was done in 50 women with RPL for IL-10-592C/A 
and TNF-α-308G/A promoter polymorphism to see the association of these loci with 
pregnancy loss. The control group included 50 healthy women having two or more 
children (mean age of the female subjects 35 years) for statistical comparisons.
RESULTS: IL- 10-592C/A and TNF-α-308G/A promoter polymorphisms were not 
associated with the recurrent miscarriages.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to screen a larger sample and in different ethnic 
groups using IL-10-592C/A and TNF-α-308G/A markers to understand their 
association with recurrent miscarriages. This would further help in efficient 
management of immunologically mediated recurrent miscarriages at the 
sample/individual level.
