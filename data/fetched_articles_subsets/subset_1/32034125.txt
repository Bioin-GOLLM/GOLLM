Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are isolated from the inner cell mass of 
blastocysts, and they exist in different states of pluripotency-naïve and primed 
states. Pten is a well-known tumor suppressor. Here, we generated Pten-/- mouse 
ESCs with the CRISPR-Cas9 system and verified that Pten-/- ESCs maintained naïve 
pluripotency by blocking Gsk3β activity. Serum/LIF and 2i (MAPK and GSK3 
inhibitors) conditions are commonly used for ESC maintenance. We show that the 
Pten-inhibitor SF1670 contributed to sustaining mouse ESCs and that Pten 
activation by the S380A, T382A, and T383A mutations (Pten-A3) suppressed the 
pluripotency of ESCs. The in vivo teratoma formation ability of SF1670-treated 
ESCs increased, while the Pten-A3 mutations suppressed teratoma formation. 
Furthermore, the embryoid bodies derived from Pten-deficient ESCs or 
SF1670-treated wild-type ESCs showed greater expression of ectoderm and 
pluripotency markers. These results suggest that Pten-mediated Gsk3β modulates 
the naïve pluripotency of ESCs and that Pten ablation regulates the 
lineage-specific differentiation.
