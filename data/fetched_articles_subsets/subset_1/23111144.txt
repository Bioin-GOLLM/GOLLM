BACKGROUND: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) depends on the 
initial activation of CD4(+) T cells responsive to myelin autoantigens. The key 
antigen presenting cell (APC) population that drives the activation of naïve T 
cells most efficiently is the dendritic cell (DC). As such, we should be able to 
trigger EAE by transfer of DC that can present the relevant autoantigen(s). 
Despite some sporadic reports, however, models of DC-driven EAE have not been 
widely adopted. We sought to test the feasibility of this approach and whether 
activation of the DC by toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 ligation was a sufficient 
stimulus to drive EAE.
FINDINGS: Host mice were seeded with myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive CD4+ T 
cells and then were injected with DC that could present the relevant MBP peptide 
which had been exposed to lipopolysaccharide as a TLR-4 agonist. We found that 
this approach induced robust clinical signs of EAE.
CONCLUSIONS: DC are sufficient as APC to effectively drive the differentiation 
of naïve myelin-responsive T cells into autoaggressive effector T cells. 
TLR-4-stimulation can activate the DC sufficiently to deliver the signals 
required to drive the pathogenic function of the T cell. These models will allow 
the dissection of the molecular requirements of the initial DC-T cell 
interaction in the lymphoid organs that ultimately leads to autoimmune pathology 
in the central nervous system.
