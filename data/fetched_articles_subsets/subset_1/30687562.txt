Traditional cancer therapies include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, all 
of which are typically non-specific approaches. Cancer immunotherapy is a type 
of cancer treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer. Cancer 
immunotherapy represents a standing example of precision medicine: immune 
checkpoint inhibitors precisely target the checkpoints; tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes, TCR T cells, and CAR T cells precisely kill cancer cells through 
tumor antigen recognition; and cancer vaccines are made from patient-derived 
dendritic cells, tumor cell DNA, or RNA, or oncolytic viruses, thus offering a 
type of personalized medicine. This review will highlight up-to-date advancement 
in most, if not all, of the immunotherapy strategies.
