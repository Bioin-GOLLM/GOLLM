BACKGROUND: The study of breast cancer in women with African ancestry offers the 
promise of identifying markers for risk assessment and treatment of 
triple-negative disease.
METHODS: African American and white American women with invasive cancer 
diagnosed at the Henry Ford Health System comprised the primary study 
population, and Ghanaian patients diagnosed and/or treated at the Komfo Anokye 
Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana constituted the comparison group. 
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were transported to the University 
of Michigan for histopathology confirmation, and assessment of estrogen and 
progesterone receptors and HER-2/neu expression.
RESULTS: The study population included 1008 white Americans, 581 African 
Americans, and 75 Ghanaians. Mean age at diagnosis was 48.0 years for Ghanaian, 
60.8 years for African American, and 62.4 for white American cases (P=.002). 
Proportions of Ghanaian, African American, and white American cases with 
estrogen receptor-negative tumors were 76%, 36%, and 22%, respectively (P<.001), 
and proportions with triple-negative disease were 82%, 26%, and 16%, 
respectively (P<.001). All Ghanaian cases were palpable, locally advanced 
cancers; 57 (76%) were grade 3. A total of 147 American women were diagnosed as 
stage III or IV; of these, 67.5% (n=46) of African Americans and 44.6% (n=29) of 
white Americans were grade 3. Among palpable, grade 3 cancers, Ghanaians had the 
highest prevalence of triple-negative tumors (82.2%), followed by African 
Americans (32.8%) and white Americans (10.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates progressively increasing frequency of 
estrogen receptor-negative and triple-negative tumors among breast cancer 
patients with white American, African American, and Ghanaian/African 
backgrounds. This pattern indicates a need for additional investigations 
correlating the extent of African ancestry and high-risk breast cancer subtypes.
