Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) often experience gastrointestinal (GI) 
abnormalities. In recent years, the intestinal microbiome has been postulated as 
a contributor to the development of CF-associated GI complications, hence 
representing a potential therapeutic target for treatment. We recently developed 
a rabbit model of CF, which is shown to manifest many human patient-like 
pathological changes, including intestinal obstruction. Here, we investigated 
the feces microbiome in young CF rabbits in the absence of antibiotics 
treatment. Stool samples were collected from seven- to nine-week-old CF rabbits 
(n = 7) and age-matched wild-type (WT) rabbits (n = 6). Microbiomes were 
investigated by iTag sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, and functional profiles were 
predicted using PICRUSt. Consistent with reports of those in pediatric CF 
patients, the fecal microbiomes of CF rabbits are of lower richness and 
diversity than that of WT rabbits, with a marked taxonomic and inferred 
functional dysbiosis. Our work identified a new CF animal model with the 
manifestation of intestinal dysbiosis phenotype. This model system may 
facilitate the research and development of novel treatments for CF-associated 
gastrointestinal diseases.
