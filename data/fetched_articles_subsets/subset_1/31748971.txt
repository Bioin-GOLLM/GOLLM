PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this article is to review recent developments 
demonstrating the role of allergies, the utility of allergy testing, and the 
role of the allergist in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) management.
RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of patients with EoE have concurrent atopic 
disorders including food anaphylaxis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema. An 
atopic population likely is at greater risk for EoE. Delayed type 
hypersensitivity to food antigens is the most common pathogenic mechanism. 
Aeroallergens and pollen-food cross-reactivity also can trigger EoE. Th2 
cell-mediated adaptive and innate immunity in response to epithelial damage 
occurs via IL-13- and IL-4-producing T cells and innate lymphoid cells. While 
IgE testing for foods is insufficient to build an elimination diet, IgE-mediated 
allergy may play a role in EoE severity and clinical course. There is strong 
evidence that Th2 immunity drives EoE. Optimal EoE management should include 
elucidating and managing EoE triggers and concurrent atopic diatheses.
