It has been known for many years that elevated signaling by the ERK1/2 pathway 
is frequently associated with the growth and survival of many tumor cell types 
under a variety of normal and stressful conditions, including the response of 
cells to other cancer interventional therapeutic strategies e.g., references 
1–4. There is, however, a modest significant literature showing that enhanced 
ERK1/2 signaling can also cause tumor cell death e.g., references 5–8. The role 
of ERK1/2 signaling is clearly complex, for example as shown by the Koumenis 
group where inhibition of radiation-induced ERK1/2 signaling caused 
radiosensitization, whereas inhibition of curcumin-hyper-stimulated ERK1/2 
signaling reduced radiosensitivity. 7 Presumably this Janus-faced behavior of 
the ERK1/2 pathway in terms of cell survival regulation will depend upon the 
tumor cell type, the intensity of ERK1/2 stimulation, and the molecular 
intervention/drug being used.
