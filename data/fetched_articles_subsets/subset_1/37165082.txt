F508del, the most frequent mutation in cystic fibrosis (CF), impairs the 
stability and folding of the CFTR chloride channel, thus resulting in 
intracellular retention and CFTR degradation. The F508del defect can be targeted 
with pharmacological correctors, such as VX-809 and VX-445, that stabilize CFTR 
and improve its trafficking to plasma membrane. Using a functional test to 
evaluate a panel of chemical compounds, we have identified tricyclic 
pyrrolo-quinolines as novel F508del correctors with high efficacy on primary 
airway epithelial cells from CF patients. The most effective compound, PP028, 
showed synergy when combined with VX-809 and VX-661 but not with VX-445. By 
testing the ability of correctors to stabilize CFTR fragments of different 
length, we found that VX-809 is effective on the amino-terminal portion of the 
protein that includes the first membrane-spanning domain (amino acids 1-387). 
Instead, PP028 and VX-445 only show a stabilizing effect when the second 
membrane-spanning domain is included (amino acids 1-1181). Our results indicate 
that tricyclic pyrrolo-quinolines are a novel class of CFTR correctors that, 
similarly to VX-445, interact with CFTR at a site different from that of VX-809. 
Tricyclic pirrolo-quinolines may represent novel CFTR correctors suitable for 
combinatorial pharmacological treatments to treat the basic defect in CF.
