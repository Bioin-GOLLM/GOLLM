Hypoxemia is a defining feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 
an often-fatal complication of pulmonary or systemic inflammation, yet the 
resulting tissue hypoxia, and its impact on immune responses, is often 
neglected. In the present study, we have shown that ARDS patients were hypoxemic 
and monocytopenic within the first 48 h of ventilation. Monocytopenia was also 
observed in mouse models of hypoxic acute lung injury, in which hypoxemia drove 
the suppression of type I interferon signaling in the bone marrow. This impaired 
monopoiesis resulted in reduced accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages and 
enhanced neutrophil-mediated inflammation in the lung. Administration of 
colony-stimulating factor 1 in mice with hypoxic lung injury rescued the 
monocytopenia, altered the phenotype of circulating monocytes, increased 
monocyte-derived macrophages in the lung and limited injury. Thus, tissue 
hypoxia altered the dynamics of the immune response to the detriment of the host 
and interventions to address the aberrant response offer new therapeutic 
strategies for ARDS.
