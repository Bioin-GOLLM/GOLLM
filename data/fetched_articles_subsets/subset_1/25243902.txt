Asunaprevir (ASV), an isoquinoline-based competitive inhibitor targeting the 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease, is very potent in vivo. However, the 
potency is significantly compromised by the drug resistance mutations R155K and 
D168A. In this study three crystal structures of ASV and an analogue were 
determined to analyze the structural basis of drug resistance susceptibility. 
These structures revealed that ASV makes extensive contacts with Arg155 outside 
the substrate envelope. Arg155 in turn is stabilized by Asp168, and thus when 
either residue is mutated, the enzyme's interaction with ASV's P2* isoquinoline 
is disrupted. Adding a P1-P3 macrocycle to ASV enhances the inhibitor's 
resistance barrier, likely due to poising the inhibitor to its bound 
conformation. Macrocyclic inhibitors with P2* extension moieties avoiding 
interaction with the protease S2 residues including Arg155 must be chosen for 
future design of more robust protease inhibitors.
