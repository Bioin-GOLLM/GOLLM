Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is an inhibitory T-cell receptor 
expressed by activated and regulatory T cells. We hypothesized that 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding CTLA-4 may affect 
the vigor of the T-cell response to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, thus 
influencing viral persistence. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped six CTLA4 
SNPs, from which all frequent haplotypes can be determined, using a large, 
matched panel of subjects with known HBV outcomes. Haplotypes with these SNPs 
were constructed for each subject using PHASE software. The haplotype 
distribution differed between those with viral persistence and those with 
clearance. Two haplotypes were associated with clearance of HBV infection, which 
was most likely due to associations with the SNPs -1722C (odds ratio [OR] = 
0.60, P = 0.06) and +49G (OR = 0.73, P = 0.02). The wild-type haplotype, which 
contains an SNP leading to a decreased T-cell response (+6230A), was associated 
with viral persistence (OR = 1.32, P = 0.04). These data suggest that CTLA4 
influences recovery from HBV infection, which is consistent with the emerging 
role of T regulatory cells in the pathogenesis of disease.
