OBJECT: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of small non-coding RNAs 
(sncRNAs) that affect the sncRNA function and target gene expression to mediate 
the risk of certain diseases. The association between the miR-196a2 rs11614913 
and ischemic stroke (IS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is still conflicting 
and inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed at analysing studies which have been 
done so far to get a more precise assessment of the association between the 
mutation and these two diseases.
METHODS: Electronic databases dated up to April 2018 were searched, retrieved 
and used. Revman 5.2 software and STATA version 12.0 were used for statistical 
analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to 
identify any potential associations. Heterogeneity, publication bias and 
sensitivity analysis were conducted to measure the robustness of our findings.
RESULTS: The overall meta-analysis results showed that miR-196a2 rs11614913 T > 
C polymorphism was significantly associated with CAD risk in certain genetic 
models, as well as in subgroup analysis (CC versus TT, OR = .43, 
95%CI = .39-.47, P < .00001). However, no significant association was detected 
between the miR-196a2 rs11614913 T > C and IS risk in all genetic models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that miR-196a2 rs11614913 T > C may contribute 
to CAD susceptibility but further well-designed studies with larger sample size 
and comprehensive data are needed to confirm our findings and provide a profound 
conclusion.
