States develop specific protocols for cystic fibrosis (CF) newborn screening to 
reflect the population served. We hypothesized that mutation distribution and 
detection rates would differ between Hispanic and non-Hispanic CF patients 
diagnosed by IL newborn screen with more Hispanic infants carrying mutations not 
detected by the state panel. Data from CF cases diagnosed via newborn screen in 
IL between 3/1/2008 and 10/31/2010 were reviewed. More Hispanic infants with CF 
had one or more undefined mutations after screening, in comparison to 
non-Hispanic Caucasian patients (40% vs. 9.5%; p < 0.002). The risk of having a 
positive diagnosis of CF with only one mutation noted by positive newborn screen 
increases 2-fold in Hispanic Caucasian versus non-Hispanic Caucasian infants (5% 
vs. 2.4%). Health care providers must be aware of the limitations of CF newborn 
screening to ensure appropriate counseling and prompt referral for a positive 
newborn screen, even when zero or one mutations are identified.
