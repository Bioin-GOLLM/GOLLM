OBJECTIVES: To elucidate clinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of IDH1 
and IDH2 (IDH1/2) mutations in colorectal cancers (CRCs).
METHODS: We evaluated IDH1/2 mutations in 1,623 CRCs using a next-generation 
sequencing assay.
RESULTS: IDH1/2 mutations, predominantly IDH1 p.R132C, were detected in 15 
(0.9%) CRCs and in 5 (3.0%) of 167 BRAF p.V600E-mutated CRCs. Three 
IDH1/2-mutated CRCs were associated with inflammatory bowel disease. They were 
significantly associated with old age, mucinous or signet ring cell 
adenocarcinoma, and high-grade histomorphology. Concordance of variant allele 
frequency between IDH1/2 mutants and other trunk drivers in CRCs and presence of 
IDH1/2 mutation in the adenoma and early adenocarcinoma indicated IDH1/2 
mutations could be trunk drivers suitable for targeted therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: IDH1/2 mutations in CRCs were uncommon but enriched in BRAF 
p.V600E-mutated CRCs and perhaps colitis-associated CRCs. Further studies on 
IDH1/2-mutated CRCs are needed to clarify their clinicopathologic features and 
implications for targeted therapy.
