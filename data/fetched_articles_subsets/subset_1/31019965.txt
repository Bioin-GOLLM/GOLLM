OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to clarify the clinical features, the serum level of 
autoantibodies, and cytokine of myositis patients with anti-EJ antibody, which 
targets glycyl tRNA-synthetase (GlyRS).
METHODS: Sera of 236 Chinese patients with myositis were screened for anti-EJ by 
a novel immunoprecipitation assay of flag-tagged GlyRS. Anti-EJ positive 
patients are evaluated for the clinical features and cytokine profile.
RESULTS: The sera from 4 of 236 adult myositis patients were found to carry the 
anti-EJ using established novel immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting. 
The prevalence of anti-EJ in our cohorts is about 1.7%. The decline of anti-EJ 
level was detected in two patients during disease remission. Interstitial lung 
disease and muscle weakness, but not skin involvement, are common clinical 
features of anti-EJ positive patients. Moreover, using a cytokine profile 
analyses, we found that the serum levels of IP-10, IL-6, MCP-1, and VEGF were 
significantly elevated in patients with anti-EJ and gradually decreased during 
disease remission of two patients, whereas IL-8 level was obviously reduced in 
these patients.
CONCLUSION: The novel immunoprecipitation assay is suitable to detect and 
monitor the levels of anti-EJ autoantibody. The serum levels of anti-EJ, IP-10, 
IL-6, MCP-1, and VEGF may be related to disease activity in myositis patients 
with anti-EJ antibodies.
