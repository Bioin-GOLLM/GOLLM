Bile acids are detectable in the lower airway in advanced CF lung disease and 
persist after lung transplantation http://ow.ly/RTvNW

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition that is caused by abnormalities in 
the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. People with CF 
experience life-long morbidity and premature mortality, the vast majority of 
which is associated with lung disease.
