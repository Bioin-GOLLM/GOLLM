Laminin G-like (LG) modules in the extracellular matrix glycoproteins laminin, 
perlecan, and agrin mediate the binding to heparin and the cell surface receptor 
alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG). These interactions are crucial to basement 
membrane assembly, as well as muscle and nerve cell function. The crystal 
structure of the laminin alpha 2 chain LG5 module reveals a 14-stranded beta 
sandwich. A calcium ion is bound to one edge of the sandwich by conserved acidic 
residues and is surrounded by residues implicated in heparin and alpha-DG 
binding. A calcium-coordinated sulfate ion is suggested to mimic the binding of 
anionic oligosaccharides. The structure demonstrates a conserved function of the 
LG module in calcium-dependent lectin-like alpha-DG binding.
