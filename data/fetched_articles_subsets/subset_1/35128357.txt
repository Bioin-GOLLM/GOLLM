In the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, the modulation of leukocytes' 
trafficking plays a central role, still poorly understood. Here, we focused on 
the effect of TLR2 ligands in trafficking of T helper cells through reshuffling 
of CD44 isoforms repertoire. Concurrently, strain background and TLR2 haplotype 
affected Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and expression of splicing factors. 
During EAE, mCD44 v9- v 10 was specifically enriched in the forebrain and showed 
an increased ability to bind stably to osteopontin. Similarly, we observed that 
hCD44 v7 was highly enriched in cells of cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients 
with active lesions. Moreover, TLRs engagement modulated the composition of CD44 
variants also in human T helper cells, supporting the hypothesis that pathogens 
or commensals, through TLRs, in turn modulate the repertoire of CD44 isoforms, 
thereby controlling the distribution of lesions in the CNS. The interference 
with this mechanism(s) represents a potential tool for prevention and treatment 
of autoimmune relapses and exacerbations.
