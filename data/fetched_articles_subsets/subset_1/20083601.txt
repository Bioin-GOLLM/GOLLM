Nogo-A is one of the most potent myelin-associated inhibitors for axonal growth, 
regeneration, and plasticity in the adult central nervous system. The 
Nogo-A-specific fragment NogoDelta20 induces growth cone collapse, and inhibits 
neurite outgrowth and cell spreading by activating RhoA. Here, we show that 
NogoDelta20 is internalized into neuronal cells by a Pincher- and rac-dependent, 
but clathrin- and dynamin-independent, mechanism. Pincher-mediated 
macroendocytosis results in the formation of NogoDelta20-containing signalosomes 
that direct RhoA activation and growth cone collapse. In compartmentalized 
chamber cultures, NogoDelta20 is endocytosed into neurites and retrogradely 
transported to the cell bodies of dorsal root ganglion neurons, triggering RhoA 
activation en route and decreasing phosphorylated cAMP response element binding 
levels in cell bodies. Thus, Pincher-dependent macroendocytosis leads to the 
formation of Nogo-A signaling endosomes, which act both within growth cones and 
after retrograde transport in the cell body to negatively regulate the neuronal 
growth program.
