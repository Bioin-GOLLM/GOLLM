The core mechanism of intracellular vesicle fusion consists of SNAREpin 
zippering between vesicular and target membranes. Recent studies indicate that 
the same SNARE-binding protein, complexin (CPX), can act either as a facilitator 
or as an inhibitor of membrane fusion, constituting a controversial dilemma. 
Here we take energetic measurements with the surface force apparatus that reveal 
that CPX acts sequentially on assembling SNAREpins, first facilitating zippering 
by nearly doubling the distance at which v- and t-SNAREs can engage and then 
clamping them into a half-zippered fusion-incompetent state. Specifically, we 
find that the central helix of CPX allows SNAREs to form this intermediate 
energetic state at 9-15 nm but not when the bilayers are closer than 9 nm. 
Stabilizing the activated-clamped state at separations of less than 9 nm 
requires the accessory helix of CPX, which prevents membrane-proximal assembly 
of SNAREpins.
