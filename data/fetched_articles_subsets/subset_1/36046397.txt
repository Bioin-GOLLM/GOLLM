We report on a 57 year old female patient who presented in acute respiratory 
failure with severe generalized weakness. She was previously misdiagnosed for 
over three decades as polymyositis. She was treated with enzyme replacement 
therapy (ERT) for over five years, after being diagnosed with late onset Pompe 
Disease (LOPD). She returned to independent living with the use of non invasive 
ventilation at nights. ERT should be considered in the management of patients 
with advanced LOPD and the effects of ERT closely monitored.
