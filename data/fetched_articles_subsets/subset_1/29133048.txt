The RET tyrosine kinase is an important therapeutic target for medullary thyroid 
cancer (MTC), and drug resistance mutations of RET, particularly V804M and 
V804L, are a main challenge for the current targeted therapy of MTC based on RET 
inhibitors. In this investigation, we report the structural optimization and 
structure-activity relationship studies of 
N-phenyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrimido[5,4-b][1,4]oxazin-4-amine derivatives as a new 
class of RET inhibitors. Among all the obtained kinase inhibitors, 
1-(5-(tert-butyl)isoxazol-3-yl)-3-(4-((6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyrimido[5,4-b][1,4]oxazepin-4-yl)amino)phenyl)urea 
(17d) is a multi-kinase inhibitor and potently inhibits RET and its drug 
resistance mutants. It showed IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) 
values of 0.010 μM, 0.015 μM, and 0.009 μM against RET-wild-type, RET-V804M, and 
RET-V804L, respectively. 17d displayed significant anti-viability potencies 
against various RET-driving tumor cell lines. In a xenograft mouse model of 
NIH3T3-RET-C634Y, 17d exhibited potent in vivo anti-tumor activity, and no 
obvious toxicity was observed. Mechanisms of action were also investigated by 
Western blot and immunohistochemical assays. Collectively, 17d could be a 
promising agent for the treatment of MTC, hence deserving a further 
investigation.
