Homozygous loss-of-function variants of TASP1, a gene encoding an activator of 
the histone methyltransferases KMT2A and KMT2D, cause a syndrome of 
developmental delay, happy demeanor, distinctive facial features, and congenital 
anomalies.

We report four unrelated children with homozygous loss-of-function variants in 
TASP1 and an overlapping phenotype comprising developmental delay with hypotonia 
and microcephaly, feeding difficulties with failure-to-thrive, recurrent 
respiratory infections, cardiovascular malformations, cryptorchidism, happy 
demeanor, and distinctive facial features. Two children had a homozygous founder 
deletion encompassing exons 5-11 of TASP1, the third had a homozygous missense 
variant, c.701 C>T (p.Thr234Met), affecting the active site of the encoded 
enzyme, and the fourth had a homozygous nonsense variant, c.199 C>T (p.Arg67*). 
TASP1 encodes taspase 1 (TASP1), which is responsible for cleaving, thus 
activating, the lysine methyltransferases KMT2A and KMT2D, which are essential 
for histone methylation and transcription regulation. The consistency of the 
phenotype, the critical biological function of TASP1, the deleterious nature of 
the TASP1 variants, and the overlapping features with Wiedemann-Steiner and 
Kabuki syndromes respectively caused by pathogenic variants in KMT2A and KMT2D 
all support that TASP1 is a disease-related gene.
