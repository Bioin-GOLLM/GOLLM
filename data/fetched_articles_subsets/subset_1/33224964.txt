Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) is 
associated with significant progress in biological research and has attracted 
increasing attention. However, the impact of ATAC-seq on cancer biology has not 
been objectively analyzed. We categorized 440 ATAC-seq publications according to 
the publication date, type, field, and country. R 3.6.2 was used to analyze the 
distribution of research fields. VOSviewer was used for country co-authorship 
and author co-authorship analyses, and GraphPad Prism 8 was used for correlation 
analyses of the factors that may affect the number of articles published in 
different countries. We found that ATAC-seq plays roles in carcinogenesis, 
anticancer immunity, targeted therapy, and metastasis risk predictions and is 
most frequently used in studies of leukemia among all types of cancer. We found 
a significantly strong correlation between the top 10 countries in terms of the 
number of publications and the gross expenditure on research and development 
(R&D), the number of universities, and the number of researchers. At present, 
ATAC-seq technology is undergoing a period of rapid development, making it 
inseparable from the emphasis and investment in scientific research by many 
countries. Collectively, ATAC-seq has advantages in the study of the cancer 
mechanisms because it can detect nucleic acids and thus has good application 
prospects in the field of cancer, especially in leukemia studies. As a country's 
economic strength increases and the emphasis on scientific research deepens, 
ATAC-seq will definitely play a more significant role in the field of cancer 
biology.
