Radiation therapy to the brain is a powerful tool in the management of many 
cancers, but it is associated with significant and irreversible long-term side 
effects, including cognitive decline and impairment of motor coordination. 
Depletion of oligodendrocyte progenitors and demyelination are major 
pathological features that are particularly pronounced in younger individuals 
and severely limit therapeutic options. Here we tested whether human ESC-derived 
oligodendrocytes can functionally remyelinate the irradiated brain using a rat 
model. We demonstrate the efficient derivation and prospective isolation of 
human oligodendrocyte progenitors, which, upon transplantation, migrate 
throughout the major white matter tracts resulting in both structural and 
functional repair. Behavioral testing showed complete recovery of cognitive 
function while additional recovery from motor deficits required concomitant 
transplantation into the cerebellum. The ability to repair radiation-induced 
damage to the brain could dramatically improve the outlook for cancer survivors 
and enable more effective use of radiation therapies, especially in children.
