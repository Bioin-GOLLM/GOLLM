The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) recognizes human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) class I molecules and modulates the function of natural killer 
cells. Despite its role in immunity, the complex genomic structure has limited a 
deep understanding of the KIR genomic landscape. Here we conduct deep sequencing 
of 16 KIR genes in 1,173 individuals. We devise a bioinformatics pipeline 
incorporating copy number estimation and insertion or deletion (indel) calling 
for high-resolution KIR genotyping. We define 118 alleles in 13 genes and 
demonstrate a linkage disequilibrium structure within and across KIR centromeric 
and telomeric regions. We construct a KIR imputation reference panel 
(nreference = 689, imputation accuracy = 99.7%), apply it to biobank genotype 
(ntotal = 169,907), and perform phenome-wide association studies of 85 traits. 
We observe a dearth of genome-wide significant associations, even in immune 
traits implicated previously to be associated with KIR (the smallest p = 1.5 × 
10-4). Our pipeline presents a broadly applicable framework to evaluate innate 
immunity in large-scale datasets.
