OBJECTIVES: Adult stem cells (ASCs) remain in a slowly cycling/quiescent state 
under normal physiological conditions, but they can be awakened from this by 
certain factors, such as injury signals. Previously, our group has shown that 
dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs) appear to proliferate more rapidly than their 
non-stem cell counterparts at elevated temperatures. The study described here 
has aimed to (i) elucidate optimal temperature in which to culture DFSCs, (ii) 
determine whether elevated temperatures could enhance differentiation capability 
of DFSCs and (iii) characterize stem cell and osteogenic marker expression of 
DFSCs at elevated temperatures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DFSCs obtained from rat first molars were cultured at 37 
(control), 38, 39, 40 and 41 ºC. Cell proliferation was evaluated by Alamar blue 
reduction assay and mean numbers of viable dissociated cells. Osteogenic 
differentiation was evaluated after 7 or 14 days osteogenic induction. 
Expression of selected marker genes was also assessed during proliferation and 
differentiation of the cells.
RESULTS: Increased cell proliferation was seen at heat-stress temperatures of 
38º, 39º and 40 ºC. DFSCs revealed maximal osteogenesis when cultured at 39 and 
40 ºC. Moreover, some stem cell and osteogensis-associated markers had elevated 
expression in heat-stress conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Under determined heat-stress conditions, DFSCs increased their 
proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and expression of some marker genes. 
Thus, it is likely that elevated temperature could serve as a factor to activate 
adult stem cells.
