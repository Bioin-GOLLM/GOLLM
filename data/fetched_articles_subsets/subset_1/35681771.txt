BACKGROUND: Biomarker profiles should represent a coherent description of the 
colorectal cancer (CRC) stage and its predicted evolution.
METHODS: Using droplet digital PCR, we detected the allelic frequencies (AF) of 
KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and EGFR mutations from 60 tumors. We employed a pair-wise 
association approach to estimate the risk involving AF mutations as outcome 
variables for clinical data and as predicting variables for tumor-staging. We 
evaluated correlations between mutations of AFs and also between the mutations 
and histopathology features (tumor staging, inflammation, differentiation, and 
invasiveness).
RESULTS: KRAS G12/G13 mutations were present in all patients. KRAS Q61 was 
significantly associated with poor differentiation, high desmoplastic reaction, 
invasiveness (ypT4), and metastasis (ypM1). NRAS and BRAF were associated with 
the right-side localization of tumors. Diabetic patients had a higher risk to 
exhibit NRAS G12/G13 mutations. BRAF and NRAS G12/G13 mutations co-existed in 
tumors with invasiveness limited to the submucosa.
CONCLUSIONS: The associations we found and the mutational AF we reported may 
help to understand disease processes and may be considered as potential CCR 
biomarker candidates. In addition, we propose representative mutation panels 
associated with specific clinical and histopathological features of CRC, as a 
unique opportunity to refine the degree of personalization of CRC treatment.
