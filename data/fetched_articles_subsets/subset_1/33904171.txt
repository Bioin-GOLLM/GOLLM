Artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems applied to histopathology whole-slide 
images have the potential to improve patient care through mitigation of 
challenges posed by diagnostic variability, histopathology caseload, and 
shortage of pathologists. We sought to define the performance of an AI-based 
automated prostate cancer detection system, Paige Prostate, when applied to 
independent real-world data. The algorithm was employed to classify slides into 
two categories: benign (no further review needed) or suspicious (additional 
histologic and/or immunohistochemical analysis required). We assessed the 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative 
predictive values (NPVs) of a local pathologist, two central pathologists, and 
Paige Prostate in the diagnosis of 600 transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate 
needle core biopsy regions ('part-specimens') from 100 consecutive patients, and 
to ascertain the impact of Paige Prostate on diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. 
Paige Prostate displayed high sensitivity (0.99; CI 0.96-1.0), NPV (1.0; CI 
0.98-1.0), and specificity (0.93; CI 0.90-0.96) at the part-specimen level. At 
the patient level, Paige Prostate displayed optimal sensitivity (1.0; CI 
0.93-1.0) and NPV (1.0; CI 0.91-1.0) at a specificity of 0.78 (CI 0.64-0.89). 
The 27 part-specimens considered by Paige Prostate as suspicious, whose final 
diagnosis was benign, were found to comprise atrophy (n = 14), atrophy and 
apical prostate tissue (n = 1), apical/benign prostate tissue (n = 9), adenosis 
(n = 2), and post-atrophic hyperplasia (n = 1). Paige Prostate resulted in the 
identification of four additional patients whose diagnoses were upgraded from 
benign/suspicious to malignant. Additionally, this AI-based test provided an 
estimated 65.5% reduction of the diagnostic time for the material analyzed. 
Given its optimal sensitivity and NPV, Paige Prostate has the potential to be 
employed for the automated identification of patients whose histologic slides 
could forgo full histopathologic review. In addition to providing incremental 
improvements in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, this AI-based system 
identified patients whose prostate cancers were not initially diagnosed by three 
experienced histopathologists. © 2021 The Authors. The Journal of Pathology
