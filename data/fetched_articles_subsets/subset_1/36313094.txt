BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed conflicting evidence on the association 
between the intake of dietary branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and the risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, this relationship has not been studied in 
patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of total and 
individual dietary BCAA (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) intake on CVD risk 
among individuals with type 2 diabetes in China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 419 patients with type 2 diabetes who have 
been diagnosed with CVD (within 2 weeks) were recruited between March 2013 and 
September 2015 in China. Cases with CVD were 1:1 matched to controls with type 2 
diabetes but without CVD by age (±5 years) and sex. A validated 79-item 
semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was administered to assess 
the participants' dietary data. Total dietary BCAA per individual was the 
summation of the daily intake of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. OR and 
corresponding CIs were computed by conditional logistic regression models 
adjusted for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Median values of the daily intake of total BCAA were 11.87 g, with an 
interquartile range of 10.46-13.15 g for cases, and 12.47 g, with an 
interquartile range of 11.08-13.79 g for controls (P = 0.001). Dietary BCAA was 
inversely related to CVD risk after multivariable adjustment (OR Q4-Q1 = 0.23, 
95%CI = 0.10, 0.51, P trend <0.001 for total BCAA; OR Q4-Q1 = 0.20, 95%CI = 
0.07, 0.53, P trend = 0.001 for leucine). For each 1-S.D. increase in total 
dietary BCAA, leucine or valine intake was associated with 54% (95%CI = 29%, 
70%, P = 0.001), 64% (95%CI = 29%, 82%, P = 0.003), or 54% (95%CI = 1%, 79%, P = 
0.049) decrease in the risk of CVD, respectively. Whole grains, starchy 
vegetables, mushrooms, fruit, eggs, and dairy and dairy product-derived BCAA 
were found to attenuate CVD risk (P ranged: = 0.002-0.027).
CONCLUSION: Higher BCAA intake, in particular leucine and valine, might be 
associated with a lower risk of CVD.
