Boundary Element-Associated Factor 32 (BEAF 32) is a sequence specific DNA 
binding protein involved in functioning of chromatin domain boundaries in 
Drosophila. Several studies also show it to be involved in transcriptional 
regulation of a large number of genes, many of which are annotated to have cell 
cycle, development and differentiation related function. Since 
post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins add to their functional 
capacity, we investigated the PTMs on BEAF 32. The protein is known to be 
phosphorylated and O-GlcNAcylated. We mapped O-GlcNAc site at T91 of BEAF 32 and 
showed that it is linked to the deposition of active histone (H3K4me3) marks at 
transcription start site (TSS) of associated genes. Its role as a boundary 
associated factor, however, does not depend on this modification. Our study 
shows that by virtue of O-GlcNAcylation, BEAF 32 is linked to epigenetic 
mechanisms that activate a subset of associated genes.
