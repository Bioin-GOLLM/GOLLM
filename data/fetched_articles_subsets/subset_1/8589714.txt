Autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronism type I is a rare life-threatening 
disease characterized by severe neonatal salt wasting, hyperkalaemia, metabolic 
acidosis, and unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoid hormones. Investigation of 
affected offspring of consanguineous union reveals mutations in either the alpha 
or beta subunits of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel in five 
kindreds. These mutations are homozygous in affected subjects, co-segregate with 
the disease, and introduce frameshift, premature termination or missense 
mutations that result in loss of channel activity. These findings demonstrate 
the molecular basis and explain the pathophysiology of this disease.
