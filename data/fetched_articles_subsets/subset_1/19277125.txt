BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common fatal autosomal 
recessive disorders in the Caucasian population caused by mutations of gene for 
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). New experimental 
therapeutic strategies for CF propose a diet supplementation to affect the 
plasma membrane fluidity and to modulate amplified inflammatory response. The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate 
(5-MTHF) and vitamin B12 supplementation for ameliorating cell plasma membrane 
features in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A single arm trial was conducted from April 
2004 to March 2006 in an Italian CF care centre. 31 children with CF aged from 3 
to 8 years old were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were diabetes, chronic 
infections of the airways and regular antibiotics intake. Children with CF were 
supplemented for 24 weeks with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF, 7.5 mg /day) 
and vitamin B12 (0.5 mg/day). Red blood cells (RBCs) were used to investigate 
plasma membrane, since RBCs share lipid, protein composition and organization 
with other cell types. We evaluated RBCs membrane lipid composition, membrane 
protein oxidative damage, cation content, cation transport pathways, plasma and 
RBCs folate levels and plasma homocysteine levels at baseline and after 24 weeks 
of 5-MTHF and vitamin B12 supplementation. In CF children, 5-MTHF and vitamin 
B12 supplementation (i) increased plasma and RBC folate levels; (ii) decreased 
plasma homocysteine levels; (iii) modified RBC membrane phospholipid fatty acid 
composition; (iv) increased RBC K(+) content; (v) reduced RBC membrane oxidative 
damage and HSP70 membrane association.
CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: 5-MTHF and vitamin B12 supplementation might 
ameliorate RBC membrane features of children with CF.
