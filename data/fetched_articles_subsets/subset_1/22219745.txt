In the title complex, [CrCl(2)(C(15)H(14)N(4)O)(2)]Cl, the Cr(III) atom is 
located on a twofold rotation axis and is coordinated by two N,N'-bidentate 
triazole derivatives and two chloride ions in a distorted octa-hedral 
CrN(2)N'(2)Cl(2) geometry. One of the two independent Cl(-) counter-anions sits 
on a special position (site symmetry [Formula: see text].) and is fully 
occupied, whereas the other is disordered around a twofold rotation axis over 
two positions in a 2:3 ratio.
