Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in pancreatic 
Î²-cells play a crucial role in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. These 
channels are composed of two subunits: a pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2) and a 
regulatory subunit (sulphonylurea receptor-1). Recent studies identified large 
number of gain of function mutations in the regulatory subunit of the channel 
which cause neonatal diabetes. Majority of mutations cause neonatal diabetes 
alone, however some lead to a severe form of neonatal diabetes with associated 
neurological complications. This review focuses on the functional effects of 
these mutations as well as the implications for treatment.
