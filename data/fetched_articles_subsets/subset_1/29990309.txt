Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATCs) have a high prevalence of BRAF and TP53 
mutations. A trial of vemurafenib in nonmelanoma BRAFV600E-mutant cancers showed 
significant, although short-lived, responses in ATCs, indicating that these 
virulent tumors remain addicted to BRAF despite their high mutation burden. To 
explore the mechanisms mediating acquired resistance to BRAF blockade, we 
generated mice with thyroid-specific deletion of p53 and dox-dependent 
expression of BRAFV600E, 50% of which developed ATCs after dox treatment. Upon 
dox withdrawal there was complete regression in all mice, although recurrences 
were later detected in 85% of animals. The relapsed tumors had elevated MAPK 
transcriptional output, and retained responses to the MEK/RAF inhibitor 
CH5126766 in vivo and in vitro. Whole-exome sequencing identified recurrent 
focal amplifications of chromosome 6, with a minimal region of overlap that 
included Met. Met-amplified recurrences overexpressed the receptor as well as 
its ligand Hgf. Growth, signaling, and viability of Met-amplified tumor cells 
were suppressed in vitro and in vivo by the Met kinase inhibitors PF-04217903 
and crizotinib, whereas primary ATCs and Met-diploid relapses were resistant. 
Hence, recurrences are the rule after BRAF suppression in murine ATCs, most 
commonly due to activation of HGF/MET signaling, which generates exquisite 
dependency to MET kinase inhibitors.
