Pregnancy requires partial suppression of the immune system to ensure 
maternal-foetal tolerance. Protein glycosylation, and especially terminal sialic 
acid linkages, are of prime importance in regulating the pro- and 
anti-inflammatory immune responses. However, little is known about 
pregnancy-associated changes of the serum N-glycome and sialic acid linkages. 
Using a combination of recently developed methods, i.e. derivatisation that 
allows the distinction between α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acids by 
high-throughput MALDI-TOF-MS and software-assisted data processing, we analysed 
the serum N-glycome of a cohort of 29 healthy women at 6 time points during and 
after pregnancy. A total of 77 N-glycans were followed over time, confirming in 
part previous findings while also revealing novel associations (e.g. an increase 
of FA2BG1S1(6), FA2G1S1(6) and A2BG2S2(6) with delivery). From the individual 
glycans we calculated 42 derived traits. With these, an increase during 
pregnancy and decrease after delivery was observed for both α2,3- and 
α2,6-linked sialylation. Additionally, a difference in the recovery speed after 
delivery was observed for α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialylation of triantennary 
glycans. In conclusion, our new high-throughput workflow allowed the 
identification of novel plasma glycosylation changes with pregnancy.
