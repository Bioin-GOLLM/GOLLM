necessarily caused by the gene mutation.

KIT is detected in a variety of cells, also in acute leukemia. Inhibition of 
wild-type KIT is not always satisfactory. The aim of this work was to evaluate 
the frequency of the most common KIT mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
and determine the correlation between mutation and expression level. Samples 
were obtained from 75 patients with AL. CD117 presence was shown in 45 of 51 
patients with AML and in 1 of 16 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). 
Asp816Val mutation was found in 3.5% of cases of AML and Val560Gly mutation in 1 
sample with acute biclonal leukemia. Other genetic changes were found in 15 of 
57 samples with AML: polymorphisms Met541Leu in 14% of cases, Lys546Lys in 7% 
and 1 case of acute biclonal leukemia, Ile798Ile in 5.3% of cases, Met541Leu in 
1 acute biphenotypic leukemia and in 6.3% of ALL. Polymorphism Lys546Lys was 
also shown in 1 case of acute biclonal leukemia. Nonsilent genetic changes were 
detected in a total of 23% cases with core binding factor leukemia. There was no 
statistical significance between KIT expression and genetic changes. There was 
no correlation between the incidence and types of KIT mutations and its 
expression on cells in AML.
