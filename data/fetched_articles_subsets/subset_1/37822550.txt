Tobacco etch virus Protease (TEVp), a cysteine protease, is renowned for its 
remarkable specific proteolysis, making it an invaluable tool for removing 
fusion tags from recombinant proteins. However, TEV protease's inherent 
insolubility limits its broad application. Fusion constructs like an N-terminal 
MBP fusion, known for its improved solubility, have been employed for TEVp 
production to address this issue. In this study, we fused the TEVp with the 
N-terminal domain of the spider silk protein, specifically utilizing a 
charge-reversed mutant (D40K/K65D) of the N-terminal domain of major ampullate 
spidroin-1 protein from Euprosthenops australis, referred to as NT*. This fusion 
construct contains a TEVp cleavage site, enabling intracellular self-processing 
and the release of a His7-tagged protease. The significant increase in soluble 
protein expression allowed us to purify approximately 90-100 mg of TEVp from a 
1-L E. coli culture, surpassing previous findings by a considerable margin. The 
enzyme remained stable and catalytically active even after several months of 
storage in a deep freezer (-80 °C).
