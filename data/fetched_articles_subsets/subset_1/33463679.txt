BACKGROUND: During evolutionary history, molecular mechanisms have emerged to 
cope with deleterious mutations. Frameshift insertions in protein-coding 
sequences are extremely rare because they disrupt the reading frame. There are a 
few known examples of their correction through translational frameshifting, a 
process that enables ribosomes to skip nucleotides during translation to regain 
proper reading frame. Corrective frameshifting has been proposed to act on the 
single base pair insertion at position 174 of the mitochondrial NADH 
dehydrogenase subunit 3 gene (ND3) that has been observed in several turtles and 
birds. However, the relatively sparse taxonomic representation has hampered our 
understanding of the evolution of this insertion in vertebrates.
RESULTS: Here, we analyzed 87,707 ND3 sequences from 10,309 vertebrate taxa to 
reveal the evolutionary history of this insertion and its common genomic 
characteristics. We confirmed that the insertion only appears in turtles and 
birds and reconstructed that it evolved independently in both groups with 
complex patterns of gains and losses. The insertion was observed in almost all 
bird orders but was absent in all members of the diverse Passeriformes. We found 
strong conservation in the nucleotides surrounding the insertion in both turtles 
and birds, which implies that the insertion enforces structural constraints that 
could be involved in its correction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that frameshifts can be widespread and can 
be retained for millions of years if they are embedded in a conserved sequence 
theme.
