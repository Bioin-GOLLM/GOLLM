Instability to storage and shipping conditions and injection administration 
remain major challenges in treating chronic conditions with biopharmaceuticals. 
Herein, formulations of poly(trehalose methacrylate) (pTrMA) were successfully 
optimized to stabilize insulin without appreciably increasing viscosity. 
Polymers were synthesized (2,400 - 29,200 Da), and added to insulin at different 
concentrations. pTrMA maintained >95% intact insulin against 250 rpm at 37 °C 
for 3 hours with at least 10 mol. eq. of 5.0 kDa, 7.5 mol. eq. of 9.4 kDa, 5 
mol. eq. of 12.8 kDa, 1 mol. eq. of 19.8 kDa, and 0.5 mol. eq. of 29.2 kDa 
polymers, compared to 13.1% of insulin alone. The lowest pTrMA concentration 
formulations were more viscous than insulin alone, but the highest viscosity, 
U-600 with 10 mol. eq. of 5 kDa pTrMA, was only 1.43 cP at 25 °C. This data 
demonstrates that pTrMA is a promising low viscosity additive to stabilize the 
diabetes therapeutic insulin.
