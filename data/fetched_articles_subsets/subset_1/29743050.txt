BACKGROUND: While data from several studies over the last decade has 
demonstrated that introduction of immunologic checkpoint blockage therapy with 
anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 drugs leads to improved survival in metastatic melanoma 
patients, relatively little is known about brain-specific therapeutic response 
and adverse events in the context of immunotherapeutic treatment of intracranial 
disease. Here we report two independent cases of new intracranial metastases 
presenting after initiation of combined checkpoint blockade Ipilimumab and 
Nivolumab for recurrent metastatic melanoma in the context of positive systemic 
disease response.
CASE PRESENTATION: Case #1: A 43-year-old Caucasian male with Stage III melanoma 
of the left knee had subsequent nodal, hepatic and osseous metastases and was 
started on ipilimumab/nivolumab. He developed an intractable headache one week 
later. MRI revealed new enhancing and hemorrhagic brain metastases. After 
6 weeks of immunotherapy, there was interval hemorrhage of a dominant 
intracranial lesion but substantial improvement in systemic metastatic disease. 
Durable, near complete intracranial and systemic response was achieved after 
completion of both induction and maintenance immunotherapy. Case #2: A 58-year 
old Caucasian woman with stage II melanoma of the right index finger developed 
cutaneous, pulmonary and hepatic metastases within 4 months of adjuvant 
radiation. Although combined checkpoint blockade resulted in improvement in both 
cutaneous and systemic disease, brain MR performed for eye discomfort 
demonstrated new enhancing and hemorrhagic brain metastases. Serial MR imaging 
five months later revealed only a solitary focus of brain enhancement with 
continued improved systemic disease.
CONCLUSIONS: These cases raise the question of whether the initial immune 
activation and modulation of the blood brain barrier by Ipilimumab/Nivolumab 
somehow "unmasks" previously clinically silent metastatic disease, rather than 
representing new or progressive metastatic disease. An overview of currently 
available literature discussing the role of immune checkpoint blockade in the 
treatment of intracranial metastatic melanoma will be provided, as well as 
discussion highlighting the need for future work elucidating the response of 
brain metastases to anti-CTLA/PD-1 drugs and documentation of brain-specific 
adverse events.
