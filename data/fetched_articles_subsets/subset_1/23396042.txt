Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a multi-domain protein made up of the 
approximately 100 kDa heavy chain (HC) and the approximately 50 kDa light chain 
(LC). The HC can be further subdivided into two halves: the N-terminal 
translocation domain (TD) and the C-terminal Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). We 
have investigated the minimal requirements for channel activity and LC 
translocation. We utilize a cellular protection assay and a single 
channel/single molecule LC translocation assay to characterize in real time the 
channel and chaperone activities of BoNT/A truncation constructs in Neuro 2A 
cells. The unstructured, elongated belt region of the TD is demonstrated to be 
dispensable for channel activity, although may be required for productive LC 
translocation. We show that the RBD is not necessary for channel activity or LC 
translocation, however it dictates the pH threshold of channel insertion into 
the membrane. These findings indicate that each domain functions as a chaperone 
for the others in addition to their individual functions, working in concert to 
achieve productive intoxication.
