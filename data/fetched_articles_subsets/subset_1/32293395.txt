BACKGROUND: To explore the mechanism of action of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook 
(TWH) in the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) by network pharmacology.
METHODS: Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database and analysis 
platform (TCMSP) was used to obtain the active constituents and targets of TWH. 
"Crohn's disease" was used as a search term to search for related targets of CD 
from GeneCards database and OMIM database, thereby obtaining the targets of TWH 
against CD. The Cytoscape 3.7.1 software was used to construct a Chinese 
medicine compound-target network and STRING database to construct a 
protein-protein interaction network (PPI). The DAVID 6.8 online tool was used to 
perform gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome (KEGG) 
pathway enrichment analysis of overlapping targets.
RESULTS: The database results showed that there were 30 active ingredients (14 
key active ingredients) in TWH and 36 targets were screened out for CD 
treatment. Network analysis indicated that main targets of main active 
components of TWH were target genes such as VEGFA, MAPK8 and CASP3, which are 
involved in the regulation of cancer pathway, TNF signal pathway, hepatitis B 
pathway, apoptosis pathway, NF-kappa B signal pathway and so forth.
CONCLUSIONS: TWH can play a multi-target and multi-channel synergistic treatment 
of CD by anti-angiogenesis, anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation and immune 
regulation.
