PURPOSE: Few studies have estimated population prevalence and morbidity of 
primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD). We used administrative healthcare 
databases to estimate the prevalence of PIDD diagnoses in the United States from 
2001 to 2007.
METHODS: MarketScan databases compile claims from commercial health insurance 
plans and Medicaid, recording individual diagnoses for outpatient encounters and 
hospital stays. We used a cross sectional survey to estimate prevalence of PIDD 
using related ICD-9 codes (279.0, 279.1, 279.2, 279.8, 279.9, 288.1 and 288.2). 
Persons with secondary immunodeficiency diagnoses were excluded from analysis.
RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2007, prevalence of any PIDD diagnosis increased from 
38.9 to 50.5 per 100,000 among privately insured and from 29.1 to 41.1 per 
100,000 among publicly insured persons. B cell defects predominated. Prevalence 
was more than twice as high among Whites as among Blacks or Hispanics.
CONCLUSION: In this large database, we found a higher prevalence of diagnosed 
PIDD than has been reported previously from registries. Increased awareness may 
have contributed to the increasing prevalence.
