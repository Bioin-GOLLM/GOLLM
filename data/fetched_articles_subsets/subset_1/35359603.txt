In addition to its role as an iron storage protein, ferritin can function as a 
major detoxification component in the innate immune defense, and Cu2+ ions can 
also play crucial antibacterial roles in the blood clam, Tegillarca granosa. 
However, the mechanism of interaction between iron and copper in recombinant 
Tegillarca granosa ferritin (TgFer) remains to be investigated. In this study, 
we investigated the crystal structure of TgFer and examined the effects of Fe2+ 
and Cu2+ ions on the TgFer structure and catalytic activity. The crystal 
structure revealed that TgFer presented a typically 4-3-2 symmetry in a 
cage-like, spherical shell composed of 24 identical subunits, featuring highly 
conserved organization in both the ferroxidase center and the 3-fold channel. 
Structural and biochemical analyses indicated that the 4-fold channel of TgFer 
could be serviced as potential binding sites of metal ions. Cu2+ ions appear to 
bind preferentially with the 3-fold channel as well as ferroxidase site over 
Fe2+ ions, possibly inhibiting the ferroxidase activity of TgFer. Our results 
present a structural and functional characterization of TgFer, providing 
mechanistic insight into the interactions between TgFer and both Fe2+ and Cu2+ 
ions.
