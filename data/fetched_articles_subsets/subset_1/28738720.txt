BACKGROUND: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a severe pulmonary disease 
predominantly affects preterm newborns. Polymorphisms of surfactant-protein 
genes have been mostly evaluated as the candidate contributors in genetics of 
RDS. However the results are divers in different studies. We aimed at 
investigating the association of surfactant protein B (SPB) gene 9306 A/G 
polymorphism (rs7316) with RDS development.
METHOD: Three hundred and eighty newborns with gestational age of less than 34 
weeks were included in a multicenter case-control study. Respiratory distress 
(RD) was scored according to Downes' scoring system. Polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used for 
genotyping.
RESULT: One hundred and eighty-four neonates showed RDS and 196 did not. 
Gestational age (GA) was significantly lower in the RDS group compared with the 
controls. AA genotype and A allele were found more frequently in the RDS group 
than the controls (96.2% versus 63.8% and 98.1% versus 80.6%, respectively) (p 
=.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of association of SFTPB rs7316 
polymorphism with RDS development in Iranian newborns. The current study 
suggests that GA <28-weeks is the most important factor in predisposition to 
RDS. Genetic background in terms of SP-B gene might be involved in 
predisposition to RDS in premature neonates.
