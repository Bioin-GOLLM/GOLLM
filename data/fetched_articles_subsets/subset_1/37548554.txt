BACKGROUND: This is a case of aggressive Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) 
with an atypical intracranial location.
OBSERVATIONS: In this report, the authors present the diagnosis and treatment of 
a 12-year-old male patient diagnosed with LCH. The patient was admitted to the 
emergency department with left-sided facial palsy, and a solid lesion with mass 
effect in the pons was found. A biopsy was performed via suboccipital 
craniotomy, and the diagnosis was LCH. A chemotherapy regimen was started since 
the LCH sample was the resistant type. The patient showed improvement in his 
neurological deficit following treatment.
LESSONS: This rare localized and aggressive case's diagnosis process and 
treatment choices may apply to future cases.
