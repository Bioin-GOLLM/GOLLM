Hirschsprung disease (HD) has been described in association with microcephaly, 
mental retardation and characteristic facial features, delineating a syndrome 
possibly caused by mutations localized at chromosome 2q22--q23. We have analyzed 
a de novo translocation breakpoint at 2q22 in one patient presenting with this 
syndrome, and identified a gene, SIP1, which is disrupted by this chromosomal 
rearrangement. SIP1 encodes Smad interacting protein 1, a new member of the 
delta EF1/Zfh-1 family of two-handed zinc finger/homeodomain transcription 
factors. We determined the genomic structure and expression of the human SIP1 
gene. Further analysis of four independent patients showed that SIP1 is altered 
by heterozygous frameshift mutations causing early truncation of the protein. 
SIP1, among other functions, seems to play crucial roles in normal embryonic 
development of neural structures and neural crest. Its deficiency, in altering 
function of the TGF beta/BMP/Smad-mediated signalling cascade, is consistent 
with some of the dysmorphic features observed in this syndrome, in particular 
the enteric nervous system defect that underlies HD.
