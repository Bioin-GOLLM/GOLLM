Esophageal adenocarcinoma develops in response to severe gastroesophageal reflux 
disease through the precursor lesion Barrett esophagus, in which the normal 
squamous epithelium is replaced by a columnar lining. The incidence of 
esophageal adenocarcinoma in the United States has increased by over 600% in the 
past 40 years and the overall survival rate remains less than 20% in the 
community. This review highlights some of the signaling pathways for which there 
is some evidence of a role in the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. An 
increasingly detailed understanding of the biology of this cancer has emerged 
recently, revealing that in addition to the well-recognized alterations in 
single genes such as p53, p16, APC, and telomerase, there are interactions 
between the components of the reflux fluid, the homeobox gene Cdx2, and the Wnt, 
Notch, and Hedgehog signaling pathways.
