One of the most fundamental questions in the control of gene expression in 
mammals is how epigenetic methylation patterns of DNA and histones are 
established, erased, and recognized. This central process in controlling 
metazoan gene expression includes coordinated covalent modifications of DNA and 
its associated histones. This review focuses on recent developments in 
characterizing the functional links between the methylation status of the DNA 
and of two particularly important histone marks. Mammalian DNA methylation is 
intricately connected to the presence of unmodified lysine 4 and methylated 
lysine 9 residues in histone H3. An interconnected network of 
methyltransferases, demethylases, and accessory proteins is responsible for 
changing or maintaining the modification status of specific regions of 
chromatin. The structural and functional interactions among members of this 
network are critical to processes that include imprinting and differentiation, 
dysregulation of which is associated with disorders ranging from inflammation to 
cancer.
