Cord-blood transplantation (CBT) can cure life-threatening blood disorders. The 
HLA-B leader affects the success of unrelated donor transplantation but its role 
in CBT is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the HLA-B leader influences CBT 
outcomes in unrelated single-unit cord-blood transplants performed by 
Eurocord/European Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) centers between 1990 and 
2018 with data reported to Eurocord. Among 4822 transplants, 2178 had one HLA-B 
mismatch of which 1013 were HLA-A and HLA-DRB1-matched. The leader (M or T) was 
determined for each HLA-B allele in patients and units to define the genotype. 
Among single HLA-B-mismatched transplants, the patient/unit mismatched alleles 
were defined as leader-matched if they encoded the same leader, or 
leader-mismatched if they encoded different leaders; the leader encoded by the 
matched (shared) allele was determined. The risks of GVHD, relapse, non-relapse 
mortality and overall mortality were estimated for various leaderdefined groups 
using multivariable regression models. Among the 1013 HLA-A, -DRB1- matched 
transplants with one HLA-B mismatch, increasing numbers of cord-blood unit 
M-leader alleles was associated with increased risk of relapse (hazard ratio 
[HR] for each increase in one M-leader allele 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.05 to 1.60, P 0.02). Furthermore, leader mismatching together with an M-leader 
of the shared HLA-B allele lowered non-relapse mortality (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 
to 0.81; P 0.009) relative to leader-matching and a shared T-leader allele. The 
HLA-B leader may inform relapse and non-relapse mortality risk after CBT. Future 
patients might benefit from the appropriate selection of units that consider the 
leader.
