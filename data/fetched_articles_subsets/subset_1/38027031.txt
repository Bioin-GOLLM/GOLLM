Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic 
inflammation and joint damage. The signaling lymphocytic activation molecule 
(SLAMF) family of receptors are expressed on various hematopoietic and 
non-hematopoietic cells and can regulate both immune cell activation and 
cytokine production. Altered expression of certain SLAMF receptors contributes 
to aberrant immune responses in RA. In RA, SLAMF1 is upregulated on T cells and 
may promote inflammation by participating in immune cell-mediated responses. 
SLAMF2 and SLAMF4 are involved in regulating monocyte tumor necrosis factor 
production and promoting inflammation. SLAMF7 activates multiple inflammatory 
pathways in macrophages to drive inflammatory gene expression. SLAMF8 inhibition 
can reduce inflammation in RA by blocking ERK/MMPs signaling. Of note, there are 
differences in SLAMF receptor (SFR) expression between normal and arthritic 
joint tissues, suggesting a role as potential diagnostic biomarkers. This review 
summarizes recent advances on the roles of SLAMF receptors 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8 in 
RA pathogenesis. However, further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms 
of SLAMF regulation of immune cells in RA. Understanding interactions between 
SLAMF receptors and immune cells will help identify selective strategies for 
targeting SLAMF signaling without compromising normal immunity. Overall, the 
SLAMF gene family holds promise as a target for precision medicine in RA, but 
additional investigation of the underlying immunological mechanisms is needed. 
Targeting SLAMF receptors presents opportunities for new diagnostic and 
therapeutic approaches to dampen damaging immune-mediated inflammation in RA.
