OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE gene in 
susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: The distribution of C282Y and H63D mutations in patients with RA and in 
healthy subjects was examined by restriction endonuclease digestion of 
polymerase chain reaction amplified genomic DNA.
RESULTS: The prevalence of C282Y mutation in patients with RA was the same as in 
healthy controls. In contrast, the distribution of H63D mutation was 
significantly higher in the total RA patient population and in DRB1 QKRAA/QRRAA 
epitope positive patients compared to respective groups of controls. Analysis of 
data showed that (1) both H63D mutation and QKRAA/QRRAA DRB1 epitope are 
individually associated with RA susceptibility; (2) there is interaction between 
these 2 factors in development of RA; and (3) both these factors combined have 
stronger association with RA susceptibility than with these factors 
individually.
CONCLUSION: H63D mutation appears to play a role in pathogenesis of RA. This 
study is small and must be regarded as preliminary. These data therefore need 
confirmation from independent studies.
