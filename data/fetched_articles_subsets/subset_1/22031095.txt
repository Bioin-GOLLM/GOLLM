PURPOSE: More accurate assessment of prognosis is important to further improve 
the choice of risk-related therapy in neuroblastoma (NB) patients. In this 
study, we aimed to establish and validate a prognostic miRNA signature for 
children with NB and tested it in both fresh frozen and archived formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Four hundred-thirty human mature miRNAs were profiled in 
two patient subgroups with maximally divergent clinical courses. Univariate 
logistic regression analysis was used to select miRNAs correlating with NB 
patient survival. A 25-miRNA gene signature was built using 51 training samples, 
tested on 179 test samples, and validated on an independent set of 304 fresh 
frozen tumor samples and 75 archived FFPE samples.
RESULTS: The 25-miRNA signature significantly discriminates the test patients 
with respect to progression-free and overall survival (P < 0.0001), both in the 
overall population and in the cohort of high-risk patients. Multivariate 
analysis indicates that the miRNA signature is an independent predictor of 
patient survival after controlling for current risk factors. The results were 
confirmed in an external validation set. In contrast to a previously published 
mRNA classifier, the 25-miRNA signature was found to be predictive for patient 
survival in a set of 75 FFPE neuroblastoma samples.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we present the largest NB miRNA expression study so 
far, including more than 500 NB patients. We established and validated a robust 
miRNA classifier, able to identify a cohort of high-risk NB patients at greater 
risk for adverse outcome using both fresh frozen and archived material.
