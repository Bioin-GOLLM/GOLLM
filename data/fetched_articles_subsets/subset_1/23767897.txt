OBJECTIVE: To examine factors that impede or facilitate physicians' detection of 
depression in later life, including cognitive impairment and patients' 
endorsement of dysphoria.
METHODS: A population-based sample of 344 adults from the Swedish Adoption/Twin 
Study of Aging (SATSA) was utilized. Physician detection of depression was 
determined by (1) outpatient medical records, (2) antidepressant prescription, 
and/or (3) inpatient hospitalization. Depressive symptoms were measured by 
highest score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale 
(CES-D), administered on six occasions between 1986 and 1994. Endorsement of 
dysphoria was examined using two items on the CES-D. The Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) was used to indicate cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: One-hundred thirty-six individuals were above the cut-off on the CES-D 
on at least one occasion; however, only 14 of these individuals (10%) were 
detected as depressed by a physician. Higher CES-D total score was significantly 
related to physician detection. Furthermore, physicians were most likely to 
detect depression if the individual endorsed the single CES-D item regarding 
feeling depressed. A significant interaction was found, such that overall CES-D 
score was only associated with physician detection among those with higher 
endorsement of the depressed item. The association between total CES-D and 
physician detection was not affected by presence of cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Depression in later life often goes undetected by physicians. 
Factors associated with detection include the frequency/severity of symptoms and 
patients' endorsement specifically of feeling depressed. Results suggest that 
physicians should routinely assess for other symptoms associated with late-life 
depression besides dysphoria (e.g., appetite loss, crying spells).
