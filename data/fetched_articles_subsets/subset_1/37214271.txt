A new species of the carabid beetle genus Bembidion Latreille is described from 
the Central Valley, Los Angeles Basin, and surrounding areas of California. 
Bembidionbrownorumsp. nov. is a distinctive species, a relatively large member 
of the subgenus Notaphus Dejean, and within Notaphus a member of the 
B.obtusangulum LeConte species group. It has faint spots on the elytra and a 
large, convex, rounded prothorax. Of the 22 specimens from 11 localities, all 
but one were collected more than 55 years ago. Although the collection of the 
holotype in 2021 at UV light suggest the species is still extant, the lack of 
other recent specimens suggests the species may have a more restricted 
distribution than in the past, and its populations may be in decline.
