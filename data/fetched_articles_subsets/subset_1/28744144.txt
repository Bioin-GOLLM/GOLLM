PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the frequencies of ALK and 
ROS1 fusion genes in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients and examine the 
therapeutic efficacies of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 421 EGFR-mutated patients taking EGFR-TKIs 
were examined for ALK and ROS1 fusion genes based on reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Progression-free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and 
compared by the log-rank test.
RESULTS: The mutations of ALK rearrangement (n=10) and ROS1 rearrangement (n=3) 
were detected. All the patients received EGFR-TKIs, and eight took subsequent 
ALK/ROS1 inhibitor. PFS was longer in single EGFR mutants (n=408) than in 
EGFR/ALK or EGFR/ROS1 counterparts (n=13; 10.7 vs 6.6 months, P=0.004). No 
difference in OS existed between single EGFR and EGFR/ALK or EGFR/ROS1 mutants 
(21.0 vs 23.0 months, P=0.196). The median PFS of eight patients treated with 
ALK/ROS1 inhibitor was 6.0 months.
CONCLUSION: Concomitant ALK/ROS1 fusion genes occurred in 3.1% EGFR-mutated lung 
adenocarcinoma patients. Concomitant ALK/ROS1-EGFR mutations may influence the 
therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-TKIs.
