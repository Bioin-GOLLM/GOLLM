mRNA for neuronal Bak (N-Bak), a splice variant of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family 
member Bak is expressed in the neurons. Surprisingly the endogeneous N-Bak 
protein cannot be demonstrated in the neurons, although the antibodies recognize 
N-Bak protein from in vitro translation or transiently transfected cells. As 
N-Bak mRNA contains premature termination codon (PTC) at 89 nucleotides upstream 
from the last exon-exon junction, it could be degraded by nonsense-mediated 
decay (NMD) during the pioneer round of translation thus explaining the absence 
of the protein. We show here that the endogeneous neuronal N-Bak mRNA is not the 
NMD substrate, as it is not accumulating by cycloheximide treatment, it has a 
long lifetime, and even prevention of PTC by interfering with the alternative 
splicing did not lead to translation of the Bak mRNA. N-Bak protein is also not 
revealed by proteasome inhibitors. Our data suggest strong translational arrest 
of N-Bak mRNA in the neurons. We show that this arrest is partially mediated by 
5'-untranslated region of Bak mRNA and it is not released during mitochondrial 
apoptosis.
