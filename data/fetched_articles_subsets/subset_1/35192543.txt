Duration of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection in people living with HIV (PWH) 
following vaccination is unclear. In a substudy of the phase II/III the COV002 
trial (NCT04400838), 54 HIV+ male participants on antiretroviral therapy 
(undetectable viral loads, CD4+ T cells > 350 cells/μL) received 2 doses of 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) 4-6 weeks apart and were followed for 6 months. 
Responses to vaccination were determined by serology (IgG ELISA and Meso Scale 
Discovery [MSD]), neutralization, ACE-2 inhibition, IFN-γ ELISpot, 
activation-induced marker (AIM) assay and T cell proliferation. We show that, 6 
months after vaccination, the majority of measurable immune responses were 
greater than prevaccination baseline but with evidence of a decline in both 
humoral and cell-mediated immunity. There was, however, no significant 
difference compared with a cohort of HIV-uninfected individuals vaccinated with 
the same regimen. Responses to the variants of concern were detectable, although 
they were lower than WT. Preexisting cross-reactive T cell responses to 
SARS-CoV-2 spike were associated with greater postvaccine immunity and 
correlated with prior exposure to beta coronaviruses. These data support the 
ongoing policy to vaccinate PWH against SARS-CoV-2, and they underpin the need 
for long-term monitoring of responses after vaccination.
