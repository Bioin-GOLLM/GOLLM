Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive disease in 
western countries with an incidence of 1:2500 in United States and 1:1000 in 
some European countries. Similar incidences were noted for the Middle East with 
variations from 1 in 2560 to 1 in 15,876 according to the degree of 
consanguinity. This is a preliminary systematic study that aims to assess the 
incidence and carrier rate of cystic fibrosis in the Middle Eastern Lebanese 
population; known for a high frequency of consanguinity. One hundred thirteen 
DNA samples were collected from neonatal blood cards obtained from newborns to 
healthy unrelated families with no previous history of Cystic fibrosis. 
Screening for Cystic Fibrosis-causing pathogenic variants was performed using 
next generation sequencing, and 17 different single nucleotide variants were 
detected, including six pathogenic and likely pathogenic. 5.5%-7% newborns were 
found to be carriers of a variant strongly suggestive of pathogenicity and 
comparable to published literature worldwide. This pilot analysis highlights the 
challenging interpretation of CFTR variants in a country underrepresented by 
large ethnic population analyses, and stresses the importance of premarital 
screening programs for Cystic fibrosis.
