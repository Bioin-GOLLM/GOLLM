RATIONALE: Standardized dosing of anti-tubercular (TB) drugs leads to variable 
plasma drug levels, which are associated with adverse drug reactions, delayed 
treatment response, and relapse. Mutations in genes affecting drug metabolism 
explain considerable interindividual pharmacokinetic variability; however, 
pharmacogenomic (PGx) assays that predict metabolism of anti-TB drugs have been 
lacking.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a Nanopore sequencing panel and validate its performance 
in active TB patients to personalize treatment dosing.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We developed a Nanopore sequencing panel 
targeting 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 5 genes affecting the 
metabolism of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), linezolid and bedaquiline. For 
validation, we sequenced DNA samples (n=48) from the 1000 genomes project and 
compared variant calling accuracy with Illumina genome sequencing. We then 
sequenced DNA samples from patients with active TB (n=100) from South Africa on 
a MinION Mk1C and evaluated the relationship between genotypes and 
pharmacokinetic parameters for INH and RIF.
RESULTS: The PGx panel achieved 100% concordance with Illumina sequencing in 
variant identification for the samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. In the 
clinical cohort, coverage was >100x for 1498/1500 (99.8%) amplicons across the 
100 samples. One third (33%) of participants were identified as slow, 47% were 
intermediate and 20% were rapid isoniazid acetylators. Isoniazid clearance was 
significantly impacted by acetylator status (p<0.0001) with median (IQR) 
clearances of 11.2 L/h (9.3-13.4), 27.2 L/h (22.0-31.7), and 45.1 L/h 
(34.1-51.1) in slow, intermediate, and rapid acetylators. Rifampin clearance was 
17.3% (2.50-29.9) lower in individuals with homozygous AADAC rs1803155 G>A 
substitutions (p=0.0015).
CONCLUSION: Targeted sequencing can enable detection of polymorphisms 
influencing TB drug metabolism on a low-cost, portable instrument to personalize 
dosing for TB treatment or prevention.
