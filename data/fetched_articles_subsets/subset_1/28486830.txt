CONTEXT: The genus Premna (Lamiaceae), distributed throughout tropical and 
subtropical Asia, Africa, Australia and the Pacific Islands, is used in folk 
medicine primarily to treat inflammation, immune-related diseases, stomach 
disorders, wound healing, and skin diseases.
OBJECTIVES: This review exhaustively gathers available information on 
ethnopharmacological uses, phytochemistry, and bioactivity studies on more than 
20 species of Premna and critically analyzes the reports to provide the 
perspectives and directions for future research for the plants as potential 
source of drug leads and pharmaceutical agents.
METHODS: A literature search was performed on Premna species based on books of 
herbal medicine, major scientific databases including Chemical Abstract, Pubmed, 
SciFinder, Springerlink, Science Direct, Scopus, the Web of Science, Google 
Scholar, and ethnobotanical databases.
RESULTS: More than 250 compounds have been isolated and identified from Premna 
species, comprising of diterpenoids, iridoid glycosides, and flavonoids as the 
most common secondary metabolites, followed by sesquiterpenes, lignans, 
phenylethanoids, megastigmanes, glyceroglycolipids, and ceramides. Many in vitro 
and in vivo studies have been conducted to evaluate the biological and 
pharmacological properties of the extracts, and isolated compounds of Premna 
species with antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, 
antihyperglycaemia, and cytotoxic activities.
CONCLUSION: The bioactive compounds responsible for the bioactivities of most 
plants have not been well identified as the reported in vivo pharmacological 
studies were mostly carried out on the crude extracts. The isolated bioactive 
components should also be further subjected to more preclinical studies and 
elaborate toxicity study before clinical trials can be pursued.
