OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate whether there was a correlation 
between the expression of GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) and the proliferation 
of endometrium cells from women with endometriosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Endometrial tissue was collected from 20 women with 
endometriosis (experimental group) and 10 women without endometriosis (control 
group). The primary endometrial cells were then cultured and identified. Each 
group of cells were further divided into four groups. The control group was 
divided into control-no treatment (C-N), control-negative control (C-NC, 
transfected with a scrambled siRNA negative control), control-lentiviral 
transfection control (C-LC) and control-GATA-3 lentiviral transfection (C-G3); 
the experimental group was divided into experiment-no treatment (E-N), 
experiment-negative control (E-NC), experiment-lentiviral transfection control 
(E-LC) and experiment-siGATA-3 lentiviral transfection (E-siG3). RT-PCR and 
western blot were used respectively to detect the endometrium cells' GATA-3 mRNA 
and protein expression. Further, Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to measure the 
endometrium cells' proliferation.
RESULTS: The relative expression of GATA-3 mRNA and protein in the E-N group was 
significantly higher than in the D-N group and E-siG3 group (P < 0.05). The 
relative cell proliferation rate in the C-G3 group at 48 h, 72 h and 96 h was 
significantly higher than in the C-N, C-NC and C-LC groups (P < 0.05), while in 
the experimental group, the proliferation rate of the E-siG3 group was 
significantly lower than in the E-N, E-NC and E-LC groups (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the role of GATA-3 in promoting proliferation 
of endometrial cells; therefore, GATA-3 may play an essential role in the 
development of endometriosis.
