The mammalian transcription factor AP-2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding 
protein expressed in neural crest lineages and regulated by retinoic acid. Here 
we report a structure/function analysis of the DNA-binding and transcription 
activation properties of the AP-2 protein. DNA contact studies indicate that 
AP-2 binds as a dimer to a palindromic recognition sequence. Furthermore, 
cross-linking and immunoprecipitation data illustrate that AP-2 exists as a 
dimer even in the absence of DNA. Examination of cDNA mutants reveals that the 
sequences responsible for DNA binding are located in the carboxy-terminal half 
of the protein. In addition, a domain mediating dimerization forms an integral 
component of this DNA-binding structure. Expression of AP-2 in mammalian cells 
demonstrates that transcriptional activation requires an additional 
amino-terminal domain that contains an unusually high concentration of proline 
residues. This proline-rich activation domain also functions when attached to 
the heterologous DNA-binding region of the GAL4 protein. This study reveals that 
although AP-2 shares an underlying modular organization with other transcription 
factors, the regions of AP-2 involved in transcriptional activation and DNA 
binding/dimerization have novel sequence characteristics.
