In proliferating cells, where most Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) studies 
have been performed, gene repression is associated with PRC2 trimethylation of 
H3K27 (H3K27me3). However, it is uncertain whether PRC2 writing of H3K27me3 is 
mechanistically required for gene silencing. Here, we studied PRC2 function in 
postnatal mouse cardiomyocytes, where the paucity of cell division obviates bulk 
H3K27me3 rewriting after each cell cycle. EED (embryonic ectoderm development) 
inactivation in the postnatal heart (EedCKO) caused lethal dilated 
cardiomyopathy. Surprisingly, gene upregulation in EedCKO was not coupled with 
loss of H3K27me3. Rather, the activating histone mark H3K27ac increased. EED 
interacted with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and enhanced their catalytic 
activity. HDAC overexpression normalized EedCKO heart function and expression of 
derepressed genes. Our results uncovered a non-canonical, H3K27me3-independent 
EED repressive mechanism that is essential for normal heart function. Our 
results further illustrate that organ dysfunction due to epigenetic 
dysregulation can be corrected by epigenetic rewiring.
