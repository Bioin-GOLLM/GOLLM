Transitional B cells must actively undergo selection for self-tolerance before 
maturing into their resting follicular B cell successors. We found that 
metabolic quiescence was acquired at the follicular B cell stage in both humans 
and mice. In follicular B cells, the expression of genes involved in ribosome 
biogenesis, aerobic respiration, and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 
(mTORC1) signaling was reduced when compared to that in transitional B cells. 
Functional metabolism studies, profiling of whole-cell metabolites, and analysis 
of cell surface proteins in human B cells suggested that this transition was 
also associated with increased extracellular adenosine salvage. Follicular B 
cells increased the abundance of the cell surface ectonucleotidase CD73, which 
coincided with adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
activation. Differentiation to the follicular B cell stage in vitro correlated 
with surface acquisition of CD73 on human transitional B cells and was augmented 
with the AMPK agonist, AICAR. Last, individuals with gain-of-function PIK3CD 
(PI3Kδ) mutations and increased pS6 activation exhibited a near absence of 
circulating follicular B cells. Together, our data suggest that mTORC1 
attenuation may be necessary for human follicular B cell development. These data 
identify a distinct metabolic switch during human B cell development at the 
transitional to follicular stages, which is characterized by an induction of 
extracellular adenosine salvage, AMPK activation, and the acquisition of 
metabolic quiescence.
