The mol-ecule of the title compound, C26H24N4O7S, adopts a trans conformation 
about the central N-N bond, presumably to minimize steric between the 
substituents on these two atoms. An intra-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen bond occurs. 
The phenyl ring is disordered over two sets of sites, with an occupancy ratio of 
0.624 (8):0.376 (8). The azolidine ring is essentially planar [maximum deviation 
= 0.008 (5) Å] and makes a dihedral angle of 4.3 (2)° with the benzene ring and 
dihedral angles of 74.1 (3) and 69.1 (5)°, respectively, with the mean planes of 
the major and minor components of the disordered phenyl ring. The packing in the 
crystal is aided by the formation of several weak C-H⋯O and C-H⋯N inter-actions.
