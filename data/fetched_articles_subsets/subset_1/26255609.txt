MspA has been identified as a promising candidate protein as a component of a 
nanopore-based DNA-sequencing device. However the wildtype protein must be 
engineered to incorporate all of the features desirable for an accurate and 
efficient device. In the present study we have utilized atomistic molecular 
dynamics to perform umbrella-sampling calculations to calculate the potential of 
mean force (PMF) profiles for translocation of the four DNA nucleotides through 
MspA. We show there is an energetic barrier to translocation of individual 
nucleotides through a mutant that closely resembles the wildtype protein, but 
not through a mutant engineered for the purpose of sequencing. Crucially we are 
able to quantify the change in free energy for mutating key residues. Thus 
providing a quantitative characterisation of the energetic impact of individual 
amino acid sidechains on nucleotide translocation through the pore of MspA.
