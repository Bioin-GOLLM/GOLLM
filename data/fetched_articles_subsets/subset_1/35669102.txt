MicroRNA-328-3p (miR-328-3p) plays a critical role in mediating the progression 
of multiple types of cancers. To date, no study has concentrated on the 
molecular mechanism of miR-328-3p in mediating stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). In 
this study, it was found that miR-328-3p was downregulated in STAD, and 
inhibition of miR-328-3p significantly promoted the growth, migration, invasion, 
and stemness of STAD cells, while miR-328-3p overexpression exerted reverse 
effects. Through bioinformatics analysis, it was uncovered that a cluster of 
differentiation 44 (CD44) was upregulated in STAD and closely associated with 
the prognosis of STAD patients. Mechanistically, we identified CD44 as the 
target gene of miR-328-3p. Notably, knockdown of CD44 abolished the promoting 
function of miR-328-3p inhibitor in the development of STAD. Moreover, myeloid 
zinc finger protein 1 (MZF1) was confirmed as an upstream transcription factor 
for miR-328-3p, which is involved in enhancing miR-328-3p expression. In 
addition, the role of MZF1 downregulation in the malignant traits of STAD cells 
was blocked by miR-328-3p overexpression. More importantly, upregulation of 
miR-328-3p efficiently suppressed STAD tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, our 
findings illustrated that MZF1-mediated miR-328-3p acted as a cancer suppressor 
in STAD progression via regulation of CD44, which suggested the possibility of 
the MZF1/miR-328-3p/CD44 axis as a novel promising therapeutic candidate for 
STAD.
