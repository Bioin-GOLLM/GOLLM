Thyroid hormones (TH, including the prohormone thyroxine (T4) and its active 
deiodinated derivative 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)) are important regulators 
of vertebrates neurodevelopment. Specific transporters and deiodinases are 
required to ensure T3 access to the developing brain. T3 activates a number of 
differentiation processes in neuronal and glial cell types by binding to nuclear 
receptors, acting directly on transcription. Only few T3 target genes are 
currently known. Deeper investigations are urgently needed, considering that 
some chemicals present in food are believed to interfere with T3 signaling with 
putative neurotoxic consequences.
