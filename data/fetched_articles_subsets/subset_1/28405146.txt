AIM: To assess the occurrence of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) in pancreatic 
resections performed for focal pancreatic enlargement.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of all 
patients who underwent pancreatic resection for a focal pancreatic enlargement 
at our tertiary center from January 2000 to July 2013. The indication for 
surgery was suspicion of a tumor based on clinical presentation, imaging 
findings and laboratory evaluations. The diagnosis of AIP was based on histology 
findings. An experienced pathologist specialized in pancreatic disease reviewed 
all the cases and confirmed the diagnosis in pancreatic resection specimens 
suggestive of AIP. The histological diagnosis of AIP was set according to the 
international consensus diagnostic criteria.
RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-five pancreatic resections were performed in 201 men 
and 94 women. AIP was diagnosed in 15 patients (5.1%, 12 men and 3 women) based 
on histology of the resected specimen. Six of them had AIP type 1, nine were 
diagnosed with AIP type 2. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) was also present in 
six patients with AIP (40%), all six were men. Patients with AIP + PC were 
significantly older (60.5 vs 49 years of age, P = 0.045), more likely to have 
been recently diagnosed with diabetes (67% vs 11%, P = 0.09), and had 
experienced greater weight loss (15.5 kg vs 8.5 kg, P = 0.03) than AIP patients 
without PC. AIP was not diagnosed in any patients prior to surgery; however, the 
diagnostic algorithm was not fully completed in every case.
CONCLUSION: The possible co-occurrence of PC and AIP suggests that preoperative 
diagnosis of AIP does not rule out simultaneous presence of PC.
