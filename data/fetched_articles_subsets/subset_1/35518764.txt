Catalytic methods for the synthesis of previously unknown 2,9-disubstituted 
3bR*,7aR*,10bR*,14aR*-cis-14c,14d-perhydro-2,3a,7b,9,10a,14b-hexaazadibenzotetracenes 
have been developed. The structures were established by 1D (1H, 13C) and 2D 
(COSY, HSQC, HMBC) NMR spectroscopy, MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, and X-ray 
diffraction analysis. Primary screening of the synthesized perhydro 
hexaazadibenzotetracenes for antitumor activity was carried out.
