BACKGROUND: Forty years ago the actin cytoskeleton was determined to be 
disrupted in fibroblasts from persons with DNA repair-defective, hereditary 
colon cancer, with no clear connection between the cytoskeleton and DNA repair 
defects at that time. Recently, the large number of sequenced genomes has 
indicated that mammalian mutagenesis has a large stochastic component. As a 
result, large coding regions are large mutagen targets. Cytoskeletal 
protein-related coding regions (CPCRs), including extra-cellular matrix 
proteins, are among the largest coding regions in the genome and are indeed very 
commonly mutated in cancer.
METHODS: To determine whether mutagen sensitivity of the actin cytoskeleton 
could be assessed experimentally, we treated tissue culture cells with 
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and quantified overall 
cytoskeleton integrity with rhodamine-phalloidin stains for F-actin.
RESULTS: The above approach indicated cytoskeletal degradation with increasing 
mutagen exposure, consistent with increased mutagenesis of CPCRs in TCGA, smoker 
samples, where overall mutation rates correlate with CPCR mutation rates 
(R2 = 0.8694; p < 0.00001). In addition, mutagen exposure correlated with a 
decreasing cell perimeter to area ratio, raising questions about potential 
decreasing, intracellular diffusion and concentrations of chemotherapy drugs, 
with increasing mutagenesis and decreasing cytoskeleton integrity.
CONCLUSION: Determination of cytoskeletal integrity may provide the opportunity 
to assess mutation burdens in nonclonal cell populations, such as in intact 
tissues, where DNA sequencing for heterogeneous mutation burdens can be 
challenging.
