Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a recessive disorder that results in deficiencies in 
transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), a subpathway of 
nucleotide excision repair, and cells from CS patients exhibit hypersensitivity 
to UV light. CS group B protein (CSB), which is the gene product of one of the 
genes responsible for CS, belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 DNA-dependent ATPase family 
and has an ATPase domain and an ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) in the central 
region and the C-terminal region, respectively. The C-terminal region containing 
the UBD is essential for the functions of CSB. In this study, we generated 
several CSB deletion mutants and analyzed the functions of the C-terminal region 
of CSB in TC-NER. Not only the UBD but also the C-terminal 30-amino acid 
residues were required for UV light resistance and TC-NER. This region was 
needed for the interaction of CSB with RNA polymerase II, the translocation of 
CS group A protein to the nuclear matrix, and the association of CSB with 
chromatin after UV irradiation. CSB was modified by small ubiquitin-like 
modifier 2/3 in a UV light-dependent manner. This modification was abolished in 
a CSB mutant lacking the C-terminal 30 amino acid residues. However, the 
substitution of lysine residues in this region with arginine did not affect 
SUMOylation or TC-NER. By contrast, substitution of a lysine residue in the 
N-terminal region with arginine decreased SUMOylation and resulted in cells with 
defects in TC-NER. These results indicate that both the most C-terminal region 
and SUMOylation are important for the functions of CSB in TC-NER.
