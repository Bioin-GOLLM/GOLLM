BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial function and energy metabolism are impaired in 
neurodegenerative diseases. There is evidence for these functional declines both 
within the brain and systemically in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Due to these observations, therapeutics 
targeted to alter mitochondrial function and energy pathways are increasingly 
studied in pre-clinical and clinical settings.
METHODS: The goal of this article was to review therapies with specific 
implications on mitochondrial energy metabolism published through May 2016 that 
have been tested for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
RESULTS: We discuss implications for mitochondrial dysfunction in 
neurodegenerative diseases and how this drives new therapeutic initiatives.
CONCLUSION: Thus far, treatments have achieved varying degrees of success. 
Further investigation into the mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction and 
bioenergetic failure in neurodegenerative diseases is warranted.
