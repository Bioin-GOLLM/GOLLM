Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a leading cause of 
blindness. The pathophysiology involves activation of choroidal endothelial 
cells (CECs) to transmigrate the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) monolayer and 
form choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the neural retina. The multidomain 
GTPase binding protein, IQGAP1, binds active Rac1 and sustains activation of 
CECs, thereby enabling migration associated with vision-threatening CNV. IQGAP1 
also binds the GTPase, Rap1, which when activated reduces Rac1 activation in 
CECs and CNV. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that active Rap1 binding 
to IQGAP1 is necessary and sufficient to reduce Rac1 activation in CECs, and 
CNV. We found that pharmacologic activation of Rap1 or adenoviral transduction 
of constitutively active Rap1a reduced VEGF-mediated Rac1 activation, migration, 
and tube formation in CECs. Following pharmacologic activation of Rap1, 
VEGF-mediated Rac1 activation was reduced in CECs transfected with an IQGAP1 
construct that increased active Rap1-IQGAP1 binding but not in CECs transfected 
with an IQGAP1 construct lacking the Rap1 binding domain. Specific knockout of 
IQGAP1 in endothelial cells reduced laser-induced CNV and Rac1 activation in CNV 
lesions, but pharmacologic activation of Rap1 did not further reduce CNV 
compared to littermate controls. Taken together, our findings provide evidence 
that active Rap1 binding to the IQ domain of IQGAP1 is sufficient to interfere 
with active Rac1-mediated CEC activation and CNV formation.
