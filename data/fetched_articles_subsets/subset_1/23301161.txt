Voltage-gated ion channels are a class of membrane proteins that temporally 
orchestrate the ion flux critical for chemical and electrical signaling in 
excitable cells. Current methods to investigate the function of these channels 
rely on heterologous expression in living systems or reconstitution into 
artificial membranes; however these approaches have inherent drawbacks which 
limit potential biophysical applications. Here, we describe a new integrated 
approach combining cell-free translation of membrane proteins and in vivo 
expression using Xenopus laevis oocytes. In this method, proteoliposomes 
containing Shaker potassium channels are synthesized in vitro and injected into 
the oocytes, yielding functional preparations as shown by electrophysiological 
and fluorescence measurements within few hours. This strategy for studying 
eukaryotic ion channels is contrasted with existing, laborious procedures that 
require membrane protein extraction and reconstitution into synthetic lipid 
systems.
