OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the genetic polymorphisms of the uncoupling 
protein (UCP) and beta 3 adrenergic receptor (beta 3 AR) were associated with 
differences of weight loss in obese patients submitted to a low calorie diet.
DESIGN: Longitudinal, clinical intervention study of a 25% restriction in energy 
intake with respect to genotypes.
SUBJECTS: 163 patients with a body mass index above 27.
MEASUREMENTS: Body weight and body mass index at baseline and after 2.5 months, 
genotypes by polymerase chain reaction followed by enzymatic digestion.
RESULTS: For the UCP polymorphism, two alleles, 1 and 2 were identified with 
respective frequencies of 0.27 and 0.73. The allele 1 was associated with lower 
body weight loss after diet: 4,6,5.7 and 7.1 kg for the 1-1, 1-2 and 2-2 
genotypes respectively (P < 0.05). No difference in weight loss was found 
according to the beta 3 AR Trp64Arg mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant of the UCP gene is associated with a resistance 
to low calorie diet. This result, together with previous data on body weight 
gain, supports the hypothesis of a role of UCP and brown adipose tissue in the 
body weight regulation in humans. The importance of the Trp64Arg mutation of the 
beta 3 AR in the resistance to low calorie diet is still to demonstrate.
