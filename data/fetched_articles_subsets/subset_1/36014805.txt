Inonotus hispidus (Bull.: Fr.) P. Karst. spore powder (IHS) contains polyphenols 
and triterpenoids with pharmacological effects. Here, we analyzed its 
composition, and we investigated the effects of IHS on colorectal cancer (CRC) 
in B6/JGpt-Apcem1Cin(min)/Gpt (ApcMin/+) mice and its potential mechanisms by 
analyzing gut microbiota and serum metabolomics. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays and Western blotting were used to confirm the changes in the cytokine and 
protein levels associated with IHS administration. The IHS affected the 
abundance of gut microbiota and the level of L-arginine (L-Arg). Furthermore, 
the IHS influenced T cells in ApcMin/+ mice by increasing the interleukin (IL)-2 
and decreasing the IL-5, -6, and -10 levels, thus suppressing tumor development. 
Overall, IHS showed anti-CRC properties in ApcMin/+ mice by affecting the gut 
microbiota and serum metabolites, which in turn affected the Janus kinase 
(JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling, and 
regulated the abundance of CD8+ T cells. These results provide experimental 
support for the potential future treatment of CRC with IHS.
