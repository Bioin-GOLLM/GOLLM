The purpose of this clinical series was to evaluate the clinical and 
radiographic outcomes of 20 zirconia dental implants, with a minimum follow-up 
of two years. Patients with at least one zirconia dental implant were included, 
with a mean follow-up of 34.05 months. The patient complaints such as pain and 
foreign body sensation, as well as clinical parameters including peri-implant 
infections with suppuration, implant mobility, gingival index (GI), modified 
plaque index (mPI), modified sulcus bleeding index (mBI), probing depth (PD) and 
radiological distance between the implant shoulder to the closest mesial and 
distal bone-to-implant contact (BIC), were assessed. All zirconia implants were 
successfully integrated without any pain or foreign body sensation. No mobility 
was detected in any of the 20 implants. Clinical examination revealed a mean PD 
of 2.56 mm and a radiological mean distance between the implant shoulder and the 
initial site of visible bone-to-implant contact (BIC) of 1.44 mm. In addition, 
GI, mPI and mBI indicated minimal to no inflammation. Results obtained from this 
series suggest that one-piece zirconia dental implants achieve good clinical and 
radiographic outcomes over a mean follow-up of 34 months and may be deemed a 
good option in patients with favorable bone conditions.
