BACKGROUND: Mutations in LMNA gene cause cardiomyopathy, for which mechanistic 
insights are lacking.
RESULTS: Dusp4 expression is enhanced in hearts with LMNA cardiomyopathy, and 
its overexpression in mice causes it by activating AKT-mTOR signaling that 
impairs autophagy.
CONCLUSIONS: Dusp4 causes cardiac dysfunction and may contribute to the 
development of LMNA cardiomyopathy.
SIGNIFICANCE: Revealing pathogenic mechanisms of LMNA cardiomyopathy is 
essential for the development of mechanism-based therapies. Mutations in the 
lamin A/C gene (LMNA) cause a diverse spectrum of diseases, the most common of 
which is dilated cardiomyopathy often with skeletal muscular dystrophy. Lamin A 
and C are fundamental components of the nuclear lamina, a dynamic meshwork of 
intermediate filaments lining the nuclear envelope inner membrane. Prevailing 
evidence suggests that the nuclear envelope functions as a signaling node and 
that abnormality in the nuclear lamina leads to dysregulated signaling pathways 
that underlie disease pathogenesis. We previously showed that activated ERK1/2 
in hearts of a mouse model of LMNA cardiomyopathy (Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice) 
contributes to disease, but the complete molecular pathogenesis remains poorly 
understood. Here we uncover a pathogenic role of dual specificity phosphatase 4 
(Dusp4), which is transcriptionally induced by ERK1/2. Dusp4 is highly expressed 
in the hearts of Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice, and transgenic mice with 
cardiac-selective overexpression of Dusp4 display heart dysfunction similar to 
LMNA cardiomyopathy. In both primary tissue and cell culture models, 
overexpression of Dusp4 positively regulates AKT-mTOR signaling, resulting in 
impaired autophagy. These findings identify a pathogenic role of Dusp4 in LMNA 
cardiomyopathy.
