BACKGROUND: There are about 10-15% of uncommon EGFR mutations found in NSCLC 
patients, and their sensitivity to EGFR TKIs still lack sufficient clinical 
evidence, especially for rare compound mutations. Almonertinib is the third 
generation of EGFR-TKI that has demonstrated excellent efficacy in classical 
mutations, however, effects in rare mutations have also been rarely reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report, we present a patient with advanced lung 
adenocarcinoma with a rare EGFR p.V774M/p.L833V compound mutations, who achieved 
long-lasting and stable disease control after first-line Almonertinib targeted 
therapy. This case report could provide more information for therapeutic 
strategy selecting of NSCLC patients harboring rare EGFR mutations.
CONCLUSION: We report for the first time the long-lasting and stable disease 
control with Almonertinib for EGFR p.V774M/p.L833V compound mutations treatment, 
hoping to provide more clinical case references for the treatment of rare 
compound mutations.
