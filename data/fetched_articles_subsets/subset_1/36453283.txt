BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) is among the leading causes of death 
worldwide. Following MI, necrotic cardiomyocytes are replaced by a stiff 
collagen-rich scar. Compared to collagen, the extracellular matrix protein 
elastin has high elasticity and may have more favorable properties within the 
cardiac scar. We sought to improve post-MI healing by introducing tropoelastin, 
the soluble subunit of elastin, to alter scar mechanics early after MI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed an ultrasound-guided direct intramyocardial 
injection method to administer tropoelastin directly into the left ventricular 
anterior wall of rats subjected to induced MI. Experimental groups included 
shams and infarcted rats injected with either PBS vehicle control or 
tropoelastin. Compared to vehicle treated controls, echocardiography assessments 
showed tropoelastin significantly improved left ventricular ejection fraction 
(64.7±4.4% versus 46.0±3.1% control) and reduced left ventricular dyssynchrony 
(11.4±3.5 ms versus 31.1±5.8 ms control) 28 days post-MI. Additionally, 
tropoelastin reduced post-MI scar size (8.9±1.5% versus 20.9±2.7% control) and 
increased scar elastin (22±5.8% versus 6.2±1.5% control) as determined by 
histological assessments. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analyses of rat infarcts 
showed that tropoelastin injection increased genes associated with elastic fiber 
formation 7 days post-MI and reduced genes associated with immune response 11 
days post-MI. To show translational relevance, we performed immunohistochemical 
analyses on human ischemic heart disease cardiac samples and showed an increase 
in tropoelastin within fibrotic areas. Using RNA-seq we also demonstrated the 
tropoelastin gene ELN is upregulated in human ischemic heart disease and during 
human cardiac fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation. Furthermore, we showed 
by immunocytochemistry that human cardiac fibroblast synthesize increased 
elastin in direct response to tropoelastin treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time that purified human tropoelastin 
can significantly repair the infarcted heart in a rodent model of MI and that 
human cardiac fibroblast synthesize elastin. Since human cardiac fibroblasts are 
primarily responsible for post-MI scar synthesis, our findings suggest exciting 
future clinical translation options designed to therapeutically manipulate this 
synthesis.
