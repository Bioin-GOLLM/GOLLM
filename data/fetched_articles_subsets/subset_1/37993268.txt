INTRODUCTION: The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is a significant 
locus in obesity. However, the association between FTO genetic variants and body 
composition has not been fully elucidated.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This observational study examined the associations 
of FTO rs9939609 T>A with obesity and body composition markers in Koreans. A 
total of 6474 participants from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were 
analyzed for their general characteristics, body composition and FTO genotype 
with a sex-stratified approach.
RESULTS: Females with the obesity risk A allele showed significantly greater 
body weight, hip circumference, and body mass index and were at a 1.28-fold 
higher risk of obesity (95% CI=1.088 to 1.507) than those with the TT genotype. 
Analyses of body composition also showed that females with the A allele had a 
greater body fat mass and percentage, abdominal fat percentage, and degree of 
obesity, and this association and FTO genetic variation and adiposity was 
observed in females, especially aged under 50 years. However, the effect of the 
variant allele on non-fat tissue markers was not evident in females and was not 
associated with any parameters examined in males.
CONCLUSIONS: The FTO rs9939609 variant is associated with body composition in 
Koreans, especially body fat markers in females. These results support that the 
FTO rs9939609 variant is a genetic risk factor in the etiology of obesity.
