Lactate sits at the crossroad of metabolism, immunity, and inflammation. The 
expression of cellular lactate transporter MCT1 (known as Slc16a1) increases 
during immune cell activation to cope with the metabolic reprogramming. We 
investigated the impact of MCT1 deficiency on CD8+ T cell function during 
obesity-related inflammatory conditions. The absence of MCT1 impaired CD8+ 
T cell proliferation with a shift of ATP production to mitochondrial oxidative 
phosphorylation. In Slc16a1 f/f Tcell cre mice fed a high-fat diet, a reduction 
in the number of CD8+ T cells, which infiltrated epididymal visceral adipose 
tissue (epiWAT) or subcutaneous adipose tissue, was observed. Adipose tissue 
weight and adipocyte area were significantly reduced together with 
downregulation of adipogenic genes only in the epiWAT. Our findings highlight a 
distinct effect of MCT1 deficiency in CD8+ T cells in the crosstalk with 
adipocytes and reinforce the concept that targeting immunometabolic 
reprogramming in lymphocyte could impact the immune-adipose tissue axis in 
obesity.
