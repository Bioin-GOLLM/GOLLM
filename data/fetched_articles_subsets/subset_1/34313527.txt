The global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in widespread social and economic 
disruption. Effective interventions are urgently needed for the prevention and 
treatment of COVID-19. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have 
demonstrated their prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, and 
several have been granted authorization for emergency use. Here, we discover and 
characterize a fully human cross-reactive mAb, MW06, which binds to both 
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and disrupts their 
interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Potential 
neutralization activity of MW06 was observed against both SARS-CoV-2 and 
SARS-CoV in different assays. The complex structure determination and epitope 
alignment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD/MW06 revealed that the epitope recognized by MW06 is 
highly conserved among SARS-related coronavirus strains, indicating the 
potential broad neutralization activity of MW06. In in vitro assays, no 
antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed for 
MW06. In addition, MW06 recognizes a different epitope from MW05, which shows 
high neutralization activity and has been in a Phase 2 clinical trial, 
supporting the development of the cocktail of MW05 and MW06 to prevent against 
future escaping variants. MW06 alone and the cocktail show good effects in 
preventing escape mutations, including a series of variants of concern, B.1.1.7, 
P.1, B.1.351, and B.1.617.1. These findings suggest that MW06 recognizes a 
conserved epitope on SARS-CoV-2, which provides insights for the development of 
a universal antibody-based therapy against SARS-related coronavirus and emerging 
variant strains, and may be an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent.
