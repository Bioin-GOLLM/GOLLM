Brassinosteroids control root epidermal cell fate via direct regulation of a 
MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex by GSK3-like kinases.

In Arabidopsis, root hair and non-hair cell fates are determined by a 
MYB-bHLH-WD40 transcription factor complex and are regulated by many internal 
and environmental cues. Brassinosteroids play important roles in regulating root 
hair specification by unknown mechanisms. Here, we systematically examined root 
hair phenotypes in brassinosteroid-related mutants, and found that 
brassinosteroid signaling inhibits root hair formation through GSK3-like kinases 
or upstream components. We found that with enhanced brassinosteroid signaling, 
GL2, a cell fate marker for non-hair cells, is ectopically expressed in hair 
cells, while its expression in non-hair cells is suppressed when BR signaling is 
reduced. Genetic analysis demonstrated that brassinosteroid-regulated root 
epidermal cell patterning is dependent on the WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 transcription 
factor complex. One of the GSK3-like kinases, BIN2, interacted with and 
phosphorylated EGL3, and EGL3s mutated at phosphorylation siteswere retained in 
hair cell nuclei. BIN2 phosphorylated TTG1 to inhibit the activity of the 
WER-GL3/EGL3-TTG1 complex. Thus, our study provides insights into the mechanism 
of brassinosteroid regulation of root hair patterning.
