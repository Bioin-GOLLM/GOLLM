BACKGROUND: Deletion of chromosome 5q (del(5q)) is the most common karyotypic 
abnormality in myeloid neoplasms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To define the pathogenic molecular features associated 
with del(5q), next-generation sequencing was applied to 133 patients with 
myeloid neoplasms (MDS; N = 69, MDS/MPN; N = 5, sAML; N = 29, pAML; N = 30) with 
del(5q) as a sole abnormally or a part of complex karyotype and results were 
compared to molecular features of patients diploid for chr5.
FINDINGS: A number of 5q genes with haploinsufficient expression and/or 
recurrent somatic mutations were identified; for these genes, CSNK1A1 and G3BP1 
within the commonly deleted 5q region and DDX41 within a commonly retained 
region were most commonly affected by somatic mutations. These genes showed 
consistent haploinsufficiency in deleted cases; low expression/mutations of 
G3BP1 or DDX41 were associated with poor survival, likely due to decreased 
cellular function. The most common mutations on other chromosomes in patients 
with del(5q) included TP53, and mutations of FLT3 (ITD or TKD), NPM1 or TET2 and 
were mutually exclusive. Serial sequencing allowed for definition of clonal 
architecture and dynamics, in patients with exome sequencing allelic imbalance 
for informative SNPs facilitated simultaneous approximation of clonal size of 
del(5q) and clonal burden for somatic mutations.
INTERPRETATION: Our results illuminate the spectrum of molecular defects 
characteristic of del(5q), their clinical impact and succession of stepwise 
evolution.
