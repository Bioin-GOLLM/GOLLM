Four PCR-typable polymorphic markers were mapped to rat chromosome 12 by linkage 
analysis of F2 intercross progeny of Fischer (F344/N) and Lewis (LEW/N) rat 
strains. The markers formed a single linkage group, covering 27.7 cM, with the 
following order and distance between markers: plasminogen activator inhibitor 
(Planh)--0.0 cM--phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-related sequence 2 
(Pepckr2)--15.4 cM--anonymous marker (D12N155)--12.3 cM--serine dehydratase 
(Sdh). All markers were identified and genotyped by PCR analysis of simple 
sequence repeats. The gene encoding Planh was previously assigned to rat 
chromosome 12, which allowed us to assign the entire linkage group to this 
chromosome. These markers were highly polymorphic in 13 additional inbred rat 
strains (BUF/N, BN/SsN, WKY/N, MNR/N, LER/N, WBB1/N, WBB2/N, MR/N, LOU/MN, 
SHR/N, ACI/N, SR/Jr, and SS/Jr). These markers should be useful tools for 
further genetic studies in rats.
