OBJECTIVE: Native and latent conformers of AT (antithrombin) induce 
anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic signaling activities, respectively, in 
vascular endothelial cells by unknown mechanisms. Synd-4 (syndecan-4) has been 
identified as a receptor that is involved in transmitting signaling activities 
of AT in endothelial cells. Approach and Results: In this study, we used flow 
cytometry, signaling assays, immunoblotting and confocal immunofluorescence 
microscopy to investigate the mechanism of the paradoxical signaling activities 
of high-affinity heparin (native) and low-affinity heparin (latent) conformers 
of AT in endothelial cells. We discovered that native AT binds to 
glycosaminoglycans on vascular endothelial cells via its heparin-binding D-helix 
to induce anti-inflammatory signaling responses by recruiting PKC (protein 
kinase C)-δ to the plasma membrane and promoting phosphorylation of the Synd-4 
cytoplasmic domain at Ser179. By contrast, the binding of latent AT to 
endothelial cells to a site(s), which is not competed by the native AT, induces 
a proapoptotic effect by localizing PKC-δ to the perinuclear/nuclear compartment 
in endothelial cells. Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of PKC-δ 
resulted in inhibition of anti-inflammatory and proapoptotic signaling 
activities of both native and latent AT.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the native and latent conformers of AT 
may exert their distinct intracellular signaling effects through differentially 
modulating the subcellular localization of PKC-δ in endothelial cells.
