Brain oedema is a life-threatening complication of various neurological 
conditions. Understanding molecular mechanisms of brain volume regulation is 
critical for therapy development. Unique insight comes from monogenic diseases 
characterized by chronic brain oedema, of which megalencephalic 
leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is the prototype. Variants in 
MLC1 or GLIALCAM, encoding proteins involved in astrocyte volume regulation, are 
the main causes of MLC. In some patients, the genetic cause remains unknown. We 
performed genetic studies to identify novel gene variants in MLC patients, 
diagnosed by clinical and MRI features, without MLC1 or GLIALCAM variants. We 
determined subcellular localization of the related novel proteins in cells and 
in human brain tissue. We investigated functional consequences of the newly 
identified variants on volume regulation pathways using cell volume 
measurements, biochemical analysis and electrophysiology. We identified a novel 
homozygous variant in AQP4, encoding the water channel aquaporin-4, in two 
siblings, and two de novo heterozygous variants in GPRC5B, encoding the orphan G 
protein-coupled receptor GPRC5B, in three unrelated patients. The AQP4 variant 
disrupts membrane localization and thereby channel function. GPRC5B, like MLC1, 
GlialCAM and aquaporin-4, is expressed in astrocyte endfeet in human brain. Cell 
volume regulation is disrupted in GPRC5B patient-derived lymphoblasts. GPRC5B 
functionally interacts with ion channels involved in astrocyte volume 
regulation. In conclusion, we identify aquaporin-4 and GPRC5B as old and new 
players in genetic brain oedema. Our findings shed light on the protein complex 
involved in astrocyte volume regulation and identify GPRC5B as novel potentially 
druggable target for treating brain oedema.
