Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency (OMIM 191290) is one cause of early-onset 
dopa-responsive dystonia. We describe seven cases from five unrelated families 
with dopa-responsive dystonia and low homovanillic acid in cerebrospinal fluid 
who were suspected to suffer from TH deficiency. Analysis of part of the TH 
promotor showed five homozygous and two heterozygous mutations in the highly 
conserved cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element. Our data suggest 
that, if no mutations are found in the coding regions of the gene in patients 
strongly suspected of TH deficiency, the search for pathogenic mutations should 
be extended to regulatory promotor elements.
