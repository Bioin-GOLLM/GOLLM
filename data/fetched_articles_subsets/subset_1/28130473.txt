OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of [18F]AV1451 PET in visualizing tau 
pathology in vivo in a patient with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) associated 
with the V337M microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) mutation.
METHODS: MAPT mutations are associated with the deposition of 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons and glia. The PET tracer [18F]AV1451 
binds with high affinity to paired helical filaments tau that comprises 
neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease (AD), while postmortem studies 
suggest lower or absent binding to the tau filaments of the majority of non-AD 
tauopathies. We describe clinical, structural MRI, and [18F]AV1451 PET findings 
in a V337M MAPT mutation carrier affected by FTD and pathologic findings in his 
affected mother and in an unrelated V337M MAPT carrier also affected with FTD. 
The biochemical similarity between paired helical filament tau in AD and MAPT 
V337M predicts that the tau pathology associated with this mutation constitutes 
a compelling target for [18F]AV1451 imaging.
RESULTS: We found a strong association between topography and degree of 
[18F]AV1451 tracer retention in the proband and distribution of tau pathology in 
the brain of the proband's mother and the unrelated V337M mutation carrier. We 
also found a significant correlation between the degree of regional MRI brain 
atrophy and the extent of [18F]AV1451 binding in the proband and a strong 
association between the proband's clinical presentation and the extent of 
regional brain atrophy and tau accumulation as assessed by structural brain MRI 
and [18F]AV1451PET.
CONCLUSION: Our study supports the usefulness of [18F]AV1451 to characterize tau 
pathology in at least a subset of pathogenic MAPT mutations.
