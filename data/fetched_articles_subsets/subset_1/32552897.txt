BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been investigated to be correlated 
with the occurrence and progression of lung cancer. This investigation was to 
assess the efficacy and safety of recombinant mutant human tumor necrosis factor 
(rmhTNF) for controlling malignant pleural effusion (MPE) through thoracic 
perfusion.
METHODS: Through searching from MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrance 
Library, OVID and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), a total of 12 
studies with 694 patients were included in this study. A series of meta-analysis 
methods were used to analyze the extracted data.
RESULTS: Thoracic perfusion of rmhTNF combined with cisplatin promoted the 
objective response rate (ORR) (P < 0.001; odds ratio = 4.49) and the quality of 
life (QOL) of patients with MPE (P < 0.001; odds ratio = 10.33), as compared 
with cisplatin alone. Although the participation of rmhTNF increased the 
incidence of fever (P < 0.001), it seemed to relieve the adverse reactions in 
the digestive tract (P = 0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic perfusion of rmhTNF contributes to the treatment of MPE 
and improves the QOL of MPE patients.
