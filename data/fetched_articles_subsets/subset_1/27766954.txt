BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive joint disease characterized by 
gradual degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the cartilage 
and bone. The ECM of cartilage is a highly specified structure that is mainly 
composed of type II collagen and provides tensile strength to the tissue via 
aggrecan and proteoglycans. However, changes in the ECM composition and 
structure can lead to loss of collagen type II and network integrity. Several 
risk factors have been correlated with OA including age, genetic predisposition, 
hereditary factors, obesity, mechanical injuries, and joint trauma. Certain 
genetic association studies have identified several genes associated with OA 
using genome-wide association studies (GWASs).
RESULTS: We identified several novel genetic variants affecting genes that 
function in several candidate causative pathways including immune responses, 
inflammatory and cartilage degradation such as SELP, SPN, and COL6A6.
CONCLUSIONS: The approach of whole-exome sequencing can be a promising method to 
identify genetic mutations that can influence the OA disease.
