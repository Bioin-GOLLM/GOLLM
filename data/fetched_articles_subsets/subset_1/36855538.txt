BACKGROUND: Imiquimod (IMQ) is an immunomodulating drug that is approved for the 
treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, external 
genital warts and perianal warts. However, IMQ cream (Aldara®) has several 
drawbacks including poor skin permeation, local toxicity, and compromised 
patient compliance as a topical pharmacological option.
METHODS: Our research aimed to develop and optimize nanostructured lipid 
carriers (NLCs) containing IMQ for the first time using a hybrid design of 
experiments approach. The optimized formulation was then incorporated into a 
matrix-type topical patch as an alternative dosage form for topical application 
and evaluated for IMQ deposition across different skin layers in comparison to 
the performance of the commercial product. Additionally, our work also attempted 
to highlight the possibility of implementing environment-friendly practices in 
our IMQ-NLCs formulation development by reviewing our analytical methods and 
experimental designs and reducing energy and solvent consumption where possible.
RESULTS: In this study, stearyl alcohol, oleic acid, Tween® 80 (polysorbate 80), 
and Gelucire® 50/13 (Stearoyl polyoxyl-32 glycerides) were selected for 
formulation development. The formulation was optimized using a 2k factorial 
design and a central composite design. The optimized formulation achieved the 
average particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of 75.6 nm, 
0.235, and - 30.9 mV, respectively. Subsequently, a matrix-type patch containing 
IMQ-NLCs was developed and achieved a statistically significant improvement in 
IMQ deposition in the deeper skin layers. The IMQ deposition from the patch into 
the dermis layer and receptor chamber was 3.3 ± 0.9 µg/cm2 and 12.3 ± 2.2 
µg/cm2, while the commercial cream only deposited 1.0 ± 0.8 µg/cm2 and 1.5 ± 0.5 
µg/cm2 of IMQ, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In summary, IMQ-NLC-loaded patches represent great potential as a 
topical treatment option for skin cancer with improved patient compliance.
