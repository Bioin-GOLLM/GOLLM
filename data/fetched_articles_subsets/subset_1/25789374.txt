Use of next-generation DNA sequencing to analyze genetic variants in rheumatic 
disease.

Wiley GB, Kelly JA, Gaffney PM.

Next-generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized the field of genetics and 
genomics, providing researchers with the tools to efficiently identify novel 
rare and low frequency risk variants, which was not practical with previously 
available methodologies. These methods allow for the sequence capture of a 
specific locus or small genetic region all the way up to the entire six billion 
base pairs of the diploid human genome. Rheumatic diseases are a huge burden on 
the US population, affecting more than 46 million Americans. Those afflicted 
suffer from one or more of the more than 100 diseases characterized by 
inflammation and loss of function, mainly of the joints, tendons, ligaments, 
bones, and muscles. While genetics studies of many of these diseases (for 
example, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory 
bowel disease) have had major successes in defining their genetic architecture, 
causal alleles and rare variants have still been elusive. This review describes 
the current high-throughput DNA sequencing methodologies commercially available 
and their application to rheumatic diseases in both caseâ€“control as well as 
family-based studies.
