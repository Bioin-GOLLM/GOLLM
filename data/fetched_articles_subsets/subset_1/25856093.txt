The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an emerging human 
coronavirus, causes severe acute respiratory illness with a 35% mortality rate. 
In light of the recent surge in reported infections we have developed asymmetric 
five-primer reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification 
(RT-LAMP) assays for detection of MERS-CoV. Isothermal amplification assays will 
facilitate the development of portable point-of-care diagnostics that are 
crucial for management of emerging infections. The RT-LAMP assays are designed 
to amplify MERS-CoV genomic loci located within the open reading frame (ORF)1a 
and ORF1b genes and upstream of the E gene. Additionally we applied one-step 
strand displacement probes (OSD) for real-time sequence-specific verification of 
LAMP amplicons. Asymmetric amplification effected by incorporating a single loop 
primer in each assay accelerated the time-to-result of the OSD-RT-LAMP assays. 
The resulting assays could detect 0.02 to 0.2 plaque forming units (PFU) (5 to 
50 PFU/ml) of MERS-CoV in infected cell culture supernatants within 30 to 50 min 
and did not cross-react with common human respiratory pathogens.
