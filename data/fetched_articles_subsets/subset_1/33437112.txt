We analysed the patterns of genetic variability of eastern Mediterranean 
populations of the scleractinian coral Cladocora caespitosa, from the Aegean and 
Levantine seas, using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, 11 of which were newly 
characterized. The observed genetic pattern reflects a scenario of isolation by 
environment: F ST comparisons showed a higher degree of genetic differentiation 
between the two Cypriot populations that are separated by only 11 km than 
between these two Levantine populations and the Aegean population in Greece, 
which are separated by 1300 km. We hypothesize that local-scale oceanographic 
factors influenced the dispersal of planulae between the geographically close 
populations, playing a crucial role in the genetic structure of this coastal 
coral. Yet, despite being characterized as a species with limited dispersal and 
high self-recruitment, large-scale migration does eventually occur as 
first-generation migrants were identified between the most distant populations. 
In line with previous findings of reproductive plasticity in C. caespitosa, we 
also found localized differences in reproduction mode (sexual vs. asexual) 
within a geographically limited context. Several individuals were identified as 
clones, indicating the predominance of asexual reproduction in one of the 
Cypriot populations. We interpret this predominance either as a direct response 
to or as an indirect consequence of perturbations suffered by this C. caespitosa 
population. These perturbations are caused by unfavourable environmental 
conditions that threatened local survival, in particular water temperature 
changes and windstorm swells. Asexual reproduction may be a mechanism used by C. 
caespitosa to counteract mortality events and recolonize devastated areas, and 
likely accounts for the occasional high levels of clonality and low levels of 
genetic diversity. Local adaptations such as these should therefore be 
considered in conservation and management strategies to maintain and preserve 
the gene pool of this endangered species.
