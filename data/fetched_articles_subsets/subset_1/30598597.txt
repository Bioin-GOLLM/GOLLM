BACKGROUND: Intergenotypic recombinant hepatitis C virus (HCV) strains emerge 
rarely during coinfection of the same individual with two HCV genotypes. Few 
recombinant HCV strains have been identified to date and only one, CRF01 2k/1b, 
has become a worldwide concern. This study reevaluated the genotyping of three 
HCV genotype 2 strains from a group of patients with an unusually low rate of 
sustained virological response after pegylated interferon/ribavirin treatment. 
In addition, genetic determinants of host interferon resistance were evaluated.
METHODS: The HCV type 2 strains from the patients' serum were subjected to 
partial sequencing of the core-E1, NS2, NS5A and NS5B regions by reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the IFNL3 rs12979860 and 
the IFNL4 rs368234815 single nucleotide polymorphisms were defined in two of the 
three patients.
RESULTS: All three strains were phylogenetically related to the Russia-derived 
CRF01 2k/1b while they encompassed the exact same 2k/1b junction site within 
NS2.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of HCV 2k/1b recombinants in Greece and the 
greater area of the Balkans.
