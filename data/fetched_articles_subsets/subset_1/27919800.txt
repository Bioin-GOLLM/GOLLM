BACKGROUND: Cell-free protein synthesis provides a robust platform for 
co-translational incorporation of noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) into proteins 
to facilitate biological studies and biotechnological applications. Recently, 
eliminating the activity of release factor 1 has been shown to increase ncAA 
incorporation in response to amber codons. However, this approach could promote 
mis-incorporation of canonical amino acids by near cognate suppression.
METHODS: We performed a facile protocol to remove near cognate tRNA isoacceptors 
of the amber codon from total tRNAs, and used the phosphoserine (Sep) 
incorporation system as validation. By manipulating codon usage of target genes 
and tRNA species introduced into the cell-free protein synthesis system, we 
increased the fidelity of Sep incorporation at a specific position.
RESULTS: By removing three near cognate tRNA isoacceptors of the amber stop 
codon [tRNALys, tRNATyr, and tRNAGln(CUG)] from the total tRNA, the near cognate 
suppression decreased by 5-fold without impairing normal protein synthesis in 
the cell-free protein synthesis system. Mass spectrometry analyses indicated 
that the fidelity of ncAA incorporation was improved.
CONCLUSIONS: Removal of near cognate tRNA isoacceptors of the amber codon could 
increase ncAA incorporation fidelity towards the amber stop codon in release 
factor deficiency systems.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: We provide a general strategy to improve fidelity of ncAA 
incorporation towards stop, quadruplet and sense codons in cell-free protein 
synthesis systems. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled
