Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Recently, polymorphisms in NOD2 (CARD15), a gene mapping 
to the chromosome 16 IBD1 susceptibility locus, have been associated with 
susceptibility to CD. One group identified the gene by using classic positional 
cloning methods. Here, we report linkage and fine mapping analyses using 27 
microsatellite markers encompassing the IBD1 susceptibility locus in 131 CD 
affected sibling pairs, and a simplex family cohort. No evidence for linkage was 
observed, and microsatellite markers close to NOD2 did not show association. 
However, significant association was confirmed in 294 CD trios for the NOD2 
variants Arg702Trp and Leu1007fsinsC. Our fine mapping study of the IBD1 locus 
did not enable us to identify NOD2 as a CD gene, despite the presence of 
association with disease-causing alleles. This study illustrates the 
difficulties facing microsatellite linkage and linkage disequilibrium mapping 
methods for identifying disease genes in complex traits.
