Metagenomics has enabled accessing the genetic repertoire of natural microbial 
communities. Metagenome shotgun sequencing has become the method of choice for 
studying and classifying microorganisms from various environments. To this end, 
several methods have been developed to process and analyze the sequence data 
from raw reads to end-products such as predicted protein sequences or families. 
In this article, we provide a thorough review to simplify such processes and 
discuss the alternative methodologies that can be followed in order to explore 
biodiversity at the protein family level. We provide details for analysis tools 
and we comment on their scalability as well as their advantages and 
disadvantages. Finally, we report the available data repositories and recommend 
various approaches for protein family annotation related to phylogenetic 
distribution, structure prediction and metadata enrichment.
