BACKGROUND: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase deficiency (HMGCLD) is 
an autosomal recessive disorder of ketogenesis and leucine degradation due to 
mutations in HMGCL.
METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search to identify all published 
cases. Two hundred eleven patients of whom relevant clinical data were available 
were included in this analysis. Clinical course, biochemical findings and 
mutation data are highlighted and discussed. An overview on all published HMGCL 
variants is provided.
RESULTS: More than 95% of patients presented with acute metabolic 
decompensation. Most patients manifested within the first year of life, 42.4% 
already neonatally. Very few individuals remained asymptomatic. The neurologic 
long-term outcome was favorable with 62.6% of patients showing normal 
development.
CONCLUSION: This comprehensive data analysis provides a systematic overview on 
all published cases with HMGCLD including a list of all known HMGCL mutations.
