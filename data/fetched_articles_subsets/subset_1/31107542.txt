We examined whether 66 germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 
candidate genes would predict clinical outcome in 316 patients with resectable 
locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) enrolled in the ACCORD-12 phase III trial 
who were randomly treated with preoperative radiotherapy plus capecitabine 
(CAP45; n = 155) or dose-intensified radiotherapy plus capecitabine and 
oxaliplatin (CAPOX50; n = 161). The primary endpoint was tumor response 
according to the Dworak score. Multivariate logistic regression models adjusted 
on treatment arm and T stage determined the SNPs prognostic and predictive 
values for tumor response. In univariate analysis, five SNPs in ERCC2, XPA, 
MTHFR and ERCC1 were associated with the Dworak score in the CAPOX50 arm. In the 
overall population, interaction with treatment arm was significant for ERCC2 
rs1799787 (pinteraction = 0.05) and XPA rs3176683 (pinteraction = 0.008), 
suggesting a predictive effect for response to oxaliplatin-based 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT). All but XPA rs3176683 had a prognostic effect on tumor 
response. In a multivariate model, interaction remained significant for XPA 
rs3176683 ([OR 7.33, 95% CI 1.40-38.23], pinteraction = 0.018) and the 
prognostic effect significant for ERCC2 rs1799787 ([OR 0.55, 95%CI 0.32-0.93], p 
= 0.027) and ERCC1 rs10412761 ([OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.34-0.98], p = 0.042). Patients 
with the T/G haplotype of rs1799787 and rs10412761 had a 60% decrease in odds of 
response (p < 0.001). None of the five SNPs were associated with toxicity, 
overall and disease-free survival. These data suggest that genetic variation in 
DNA repair genes influences response to preoperative CRT in LARC and identify 
patients who benefit from the addition of oxaliplatin to CRT.
