The contraceptive effectiveness of intrauterine devices (IUDs) has been 
attributed in part to a foreign body reaction in the endometrium. We performed 
this study to better understand mechanisms of action of contraceptives of by 
studying their effects on endometrial and cervical transcriptomes. We collected 
endometrial and cervical biopsies from women using the levonorgestrel-releasing 
intrauterine system (LNG-IUS, n = 11), copper intrauterine device (cu-IUD, 
n = 13) or levonorgestrel-containing combined oral contraceptives (COC, n = 12), 
and from women not using contraceptives (control group, n = 11). Transcriptional 
profiling was performed with Affymetrix arrays, Principal Component Analysis and 
the bioconductor package limma. In endometrial samples from cu-IUD users, there 
were no genes with statistically significant differential expression compared to 
controls. In LNG-IUS users, 2509 genes were differentially expressed and mapped 
predominantly onto immune and inflammatory pathways. The cervical samples showed 
no statistically significant differential gene expression compared to controls. 
Hormonal and copper IUDs have significantly different effects on the endometrial 
transcriptome, with the LNG-IUS transcriptome showing pronounced inflammation 
and immune activation compared to controls whereas the cu-IUD transcriptome was 
indistinguishable from luteal phase endometrium. These findings argue against a 
foreign body reaction as a common mechanism of action of IUDs.
