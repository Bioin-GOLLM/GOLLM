BACKGROUND: Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) plays an essential 
role in the fibrinolysis system and thrombosis. Population studies have reported 
that blood PAI-1 levels are associated with increased risk of coronary heart 
disease (CHD). However, it is unclear whether the association reflects a causal 
influence of PAI-1 on CHD risk.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To evaluate the association between PAI-1 and CHD, we 
applied a 3-step strategy. First, we investigated the observational association 
between PAI-1 and CHD incidence using a systematic review based on a literature 
search for PAI-1 and CHD studies. Second, we explored the causal association 
between PAI-1 and CHD using a Mendelian randomization approach using summary 
statistics from large genome-wide association studies. Finally, we explored the 
causal effect of PAI-1 on cardiovascular risk factors including metabolic and 
subclinical atherosclerosis measures. In the systematic meta-analysis, the 
highest quantile of blood PAI-1 level was associated with higher CHD risk 
comparing with the lowest quantile (odds ratio=2.17; 95% CI: 1.53, 3.07) in an 
age- and sex-adjusted model. The effect size was reduced in studies using a 
multivariable-adjusted model (odds ratio=1.46; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.88). The 
Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a causal effect of increased PAI-1 
level on CHD risk (odds ratio=1.22 per unit increase of log-transformed PAI-1; 
95% CI: 1.01, 1.47). In addition, we also detected a causal effect of PAI-1 on 
elevating blood glucose and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates a causal effect of elevated PAI-1 level on CHD 
risk, which may be mediated by glucose dysfunction.
