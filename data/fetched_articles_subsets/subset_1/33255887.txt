A super-carbon-chain compound, named gibbosol C, featuring a polyoxygenated 
C70-linear-carbon-chain backbone encompassing two acyclic polyol chains, was 
obtained from the South China Sea dinoflagellate Amphidinium gibbosum. Its 
planar structure was elucidated by extensive NMR investigations, whereas its 
absolute configurations, featuring the presence of 36 carbon stereocenters and 
30 hydroxy groups, were successfully established by comparison of NMR data of 
the ozonolyzed products with those of gibbosol A, combined with J-based 
configuration analysis, Kishi's universal NMR database, and the modified 
Mosher's MTPA ester method. Multi-segment modification was revealed as the smart 
biosynthetic strategy for the dinoflagellate to create remarkable 
super-carbon-chain compounds with structural diversity.
