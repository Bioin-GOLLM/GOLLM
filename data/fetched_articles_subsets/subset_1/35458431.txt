The currently available antiviral treatments (Peg-Interferon-α and Nucleos(t)ide 
Analogues, NA) for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) achieve a functional cure (serum 
HBsAg and HDV-DNA clearance) of HBV infection in a limited number of patients. 
Nevertheless, the continuous pharmacological suppression of viral replication by 
NA halts liver disease progression lowering the risk of HCC development and 
improving the survival. In the near future, to fully exploit the potential of 
old and new drugs for HBV treatment a personalized approach to the patients will 
be required according to an accurate definition of their virologic, immunologic 
and clinical profile.
