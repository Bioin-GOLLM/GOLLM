Mutations in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase ( BTK) gene are responsible for 
X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). We identified BTK mutations in six patients 
with presumed XLA from unrelated Korean families. Four out of six mutations were 
novel: two missense mutations (P565T, C154Y), a point mutation in a splicing 
donor site (IVS11+1G>A), and a large deletion (a 6.1-kb deletion including BTK 
exons 11-18). The large deletion, identified by long-distance PCR, revealed 
Alu-Alu mediated recombination extended from an Alu sequence in intron 10 to 
another Alu sequence in intron 18, spanning a distance of 6.1 kb. The two known 
mutations consisted of one missense (G462D) mutation, and a point mutation in a 
splicing acceptor site (IVS7-9A>G). This study suggests that large genomic 
rearrangements involving Alu repeats are few but an important component of the 
spectrum of BTK mutations.
