There is an unmet need to overcome nongenetic therapy-resistance to improve 
outcomes in AML, especially post-myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) secondary (s) 
AML. Studies presented describe effects of genetic knockout, degradation or 
small molecule targeted-inhibition of GFI1/LSD1 on active enhancers, altering 
gene-expressions and inducing differentiation and lethality in AML and (MPN) 
sAML cells. A protein domain-focused CRISPR screen in LSD1 (KDM1A) inhibitor (i) 
treated AML cells, identified BRD4, MOZ, HDAC3 and DOT1L among the 
codependencies. Our findings demonstrate that co-targeting LSD1 and one of these 
co-dependencies exerted synergistic in vitro lethality in AML and post-MPN sAML 
cells. Co-treatment with LSD1i and the JAKi ruxolitinib was also synergistically 
lethal against post-MPN sAML cells. LSD1i pre-treatment induced GFI1, PU.1 and 
CEBPÎ± but depleted c-Myc, overcoming nongenetic resistance to ruxolitinib, or to 
BETi in post-MPN sAML cells. Co-treatment with LSD1i and BETi or ruxolitinib 
exerted superior in vivo efficacy against post-MPN sAML cells. These findings 
highlight LSD1i-based combinations that merit testing for clinical efficacy, 
especially to overcome nongenetic therapy-resistance in AML and post-MPN sAML.
