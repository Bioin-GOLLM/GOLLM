The interplay of enzyme active site electrostatics and chemical positioning is 
important for understanding the origin(s) of enzyme catalysis and the design of 
novel catalysts. We reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of TEM-1 β-lactamase 
to TEM-52 toward extended-spectrum activity to better understand the emergence 
of antibiotic resistance and to provide insights into the structure-function 
paradigm and noncovalent interactions involved in catalysis. Utilizing a 
detailed kinetic analysis and the vibrational Stark effect, we quantify the 
changes in rates and electric fields in the Michaelis and acyl-enzyme complexes 
for penicillin G and cefotaxime to ascertain the evolutionary role of electric 
fields to modulate function. These data are combined with MD simulations to 
interpret and quantify the substrate-dependent structural changes during 
evolution. We observe that this evolutionary trajectory utilizes a large 
preorganized electric field and substrate-dependent chemical positioning to 
facilitate catalysis. This governs the evolvability, substrate promiscuity, and 
protein fitness landscape in TEM β-lactamase antibiotic resistance.
