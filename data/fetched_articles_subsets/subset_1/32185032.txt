Cough and respiratory infections are common in pediatrics. Our case report 
illustrates the need for pediatricians to consider rare diagnoses such as 
genetic syndromes and primary gastrointestinal motility disorders in patients 
with unremitting respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Early identification 
provides early intervention and reduces long-term morbidity for pediatric 
patients.
