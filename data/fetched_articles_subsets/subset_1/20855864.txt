Advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare myeloid neoplasm characterized by 
uncontrolled accumulation of neoplastic mast cells (MCs) in various organs with 
consecutive impairment of organ function, drug resistance, and a poor prognosis. 
Advanced SM may present as smoldering or slowly progressing neoplasm but may 
also present as rapidly progressing aggressive SM or even as MC leukemia. 
Approximately half of the patients have an associated hematologic non-MC-lineage 
disease (SM-AHNMD) or develop an AHNMD over time. Drug resistance may not only 
result from the KIT mutant D816V that is found in most patients, but also from 
KIT-independent pro-oncogenic signaling pathways that play a role in disease 
evolution. In patients with slow progression, advanced SM can often be kept 
under control for months with interferon-Î± or 2CdA. By contrast, in rapidly 
progressing aggressive SM and MC leukemia, even polychemotherapy and 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may fail, which points to the need to 
develop new drugs and treatment concepts for these patients. In SM-AHNMD, 
separate treatment plans should be established for the SM component and the 
AHNMD component of the disease, with recognition that the AHNMD often has to be 
managed and treated as a secondary and thus a high-risk neoplasm.
