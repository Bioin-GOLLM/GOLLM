BACKGROUND: Abnormal proliferation, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transformation (EMT) of lens epithelial cells (LECs) are direct factors of 
posterior capsular opacification (PCO). Nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 
(NEAT1) has been shown to promote cell proliferation, metastasis and EMT, but 
whether it affects the progression of PCO is unclear.
METHODS: The expression of NEAT1, microRNA-486-5p (miR-486-5p) and Drosophila 
mothers against decapentaplegic 4 (SMAD4) was determined using quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The proliferation of cells was 
measured via 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2 thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide 
(MTT) assay. Transwell assay was employed to detect the migration and invasion 
of cells. The levels of EMT marker proteins, SMAD4 protein and transforming 
growth factor-β (TGF-β)/SMAD signaling pathway-related proteins were assessed by 
western blot (WB) analysis. Further, the relationship between miR-486-5p and 
NEAT1 or SMAD4 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA 
immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and biotin-labeled RNA pull-down assay.
RESULTS: NEAT1 is upregulated and miR-486-5p is downregulated in the posterior 
capsular tissues of PCO patients and TGF-β2-induced LECs. Interference of NEAT1 
reverses the promoting effect of TGF-β2 on the proliferation, migration, 
invasion and EMT of LECs. MiR-486-5p can be sponged by NEAT1, and its inhibitor 
reverses the suppression effect of NEAT1 silencing on the progression of 
TGF-β2-induced LECs. SMAD4 functions as a target of miR-486-5p, and its 
overexpression recovers the inhibition effect of miR-486-5p overexpression on 
the progression of TGF-β2-induced LECs. The activity of the TGF-β/SMAD signaling 
pathway is regulated by the NEAT1/miR-486-5p/SMAD4 axis.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that NEAT1 has a positive effect on the progression 
of PCO and is expected to become a new target for PCO treatment.
