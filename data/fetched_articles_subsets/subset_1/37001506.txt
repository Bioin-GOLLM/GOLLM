Understanding how genetic variants impact molecular phenotypes is a key goal of 
functional genomics, currently hindered by reliance on a single haploid 
reference genome. Here, we present the EN-TEx resource of 1,635 open-access 
datasets from four donors (∼30 tissues × ∼15 assays). The datasets are mapped to 
matched, diploid genomes with long-read phasing and structural variants, 
instantiating a catalog of >1 million allele-specific loci. These loci exhibit 
coordinated activity along haplotypes and are less conserved than corresponding, 
non-allele-specific ones. Surprisingly, a deep-learning transformer model can 
predict the allele-specific activity based only on local nucleotide-sequence 
context, highlighting the importance of transcription-factor-binding motifs 
particularly sensitive to variants. Furthermore, combining EN-TEx with existing 
genome annotations reveals strong associations between allele-specific and GWAS 
loci. It also enables models for transferring known eQTLs to 
difficult-to-profile tissues (e.g., from skin to heart). Overall, EN-TEx 
provides rich data and generalizable models for more accurate personal 
functional genomics.
