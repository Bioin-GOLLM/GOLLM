Human cDNAs for methionine synthase (5-methyltetrahydrofolate:L-homocysteine 
S-transmethylase; EC 2.1.1. 13) have been isolated from fetal and adult liver 
and HepG2 libraries. The cDNAs span 7.2 kilobases (kb) and consist of a 394-base 
pair upstream untranslated region, a 3795-base pair open reading frame encoding 
a 1265-residue 140.3-kDa protein, and about 3 kb of 3' region. The deduced 
protein sequence shares 53 and 63% identity with the Escherichia coli and the 
presumptive Caenorhabditis elegans proteins, respectively, and contains all 
residues implicated in B12 binding to the E. coli protein. Several potential 
polymorphisms and a cryptic splice deletion were detected in the coding region 
of the cDNAs. A polymorphism that results in a D919G modification in the protein 
is fairly common in human DNA samples. Northern analyses of poly(A) mRNA 
indicated two major species of about 8 and 10 kb in human tissues and some 
minor, partially spliced species. mRNA levels were highest in the pancreas, 
skeletal muscle, and heart of the adult and in the kidney in the fetus and were 
low in adult liver. Genomic clones were isolated and the 5' region was analyzed. 
Exon 1 is preceded by a number of potential promoter sites, including an E box, 
CAAT boxes, and a GC box, but this region lacks a TATA element. The human 
methionine synthase gene was localized to chromosome region 1q42.3-43 by in situ 
hybridization.
