Moyamoya disease is a rare cause of stroke, radiologically characterised by 
progressive stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid arteries 
and compensatory capillary collaterals. The discovery that RNF213, which encodes 
an unconventional E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the major susceptibility gene for 
moyamoya disease in people from east Asia has opened new avenues for 
investigation into the mechanisms of disease and potential treatment targets. 
The Arg4810Lys variant of the gene is most strongly associated with moyamoya 
disease, but the penetrance is lower than 1%, suggesting a synergistic 
relationship with additional environmental and genetic risk factors. White 
people carry less common non-Arg4810Lys variants of RNF213, which partly 
explains the lower prevalence of moyamoya disease in European countries and in 
the USA than in east Asian countries. Several monogenic moyamoya syndromes 
possess the radiological characteristics of moyamoya disease and have been 
associated with multiple genes and pathways involved in moyamoya angiopathy 
pathogenesis. Further clarification of the genetic and environmental factors 
that contribute to the emergence of moyamoya angiopathy could enable development 
of new treatment strategies for moyamoya disease.
