Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies 
worldwide. Here we perform a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 
Han Chinese women to identify risk genetic variants for epithelial ovarian 
cancer (EOC). We scan 900,015 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,057 
EOC cases and 1,191 controls in stage I, and replicate 41 SNPs (P(meta)<10(-4)) 
in 960 EOC cases and 1,799 controls (stage II), and an additional 492 EOC cases 
and 1,004 controls (stage III). Finally, we identify two EOC susceptibility loci 
at 9q22.33 (rs1413299 in COL15A1, P(meta) = 1.88 × 10(-8)) and 10p11.21 
(rs1192691 near ANKRD30A, P(meta) = 2.62 × 10(-8)), and two consistently 
replicated loci at 12q14.2 (rs11175194 in SRGAP1, P(meta) = 1.14 × 10(-7)) and 
9q34.2 (rs633862 near ABO and SURF6, P(meta) = 8.57 × 10(-7)) (P<0.05 in all 
three stages). These results may advance our understanding of genetic 
susceptibility to EOC.
