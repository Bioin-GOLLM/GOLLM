The effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) 
analogs were investigated using breast cancer cells. 125I-PACAP-27 bound with 
high affinity (Kd = 5 nM) to T47D cells (Bmax = 29,000 per cell). Specific 
125I-PACAP-27 binding was inhibited half maximally by PACAP-27, PACAP-38, 
PACAP(6-38) and PACAP(28-38) with IC50) values of 8, 17, 750 and >3000 nM, 
respectively. By RT-PCR, PACAP receptor mRNA was present in MCF-7 and T47D cell 
lines. Polyclonal antibodies to a PACAP receptor fragment (A-8-C) were elicited. 
The antibodies were affinity purified, recognized a 60-kDa protein by western 
blot, and stained malignant cells in breast cancer biopsy specimens by 
immunohistochemistry. PACAP-27 elevated the cAMP in T47D cells and the increase 
in cAMP caused by PACAP was inhibited by PACAP(6-38). PACAP-27 stimulated c-fos 
mRNA in T47D cells and the increase in c-fos gene expression caused by PACAP was 
reversed by PACAP(6-38). PACAP(6-38) inhibited colony formation using a soft 
agar assay and inhibited breast cancer xenograft growth in nude mice. These data 
suggest that PACAP(6-38) functions as a breast cancer PACAP receptor antagonist.
