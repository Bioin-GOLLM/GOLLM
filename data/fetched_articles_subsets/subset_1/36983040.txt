Persistent inflammation can trigger altered epigenetic, inflammatory, and 
bioenergetic states. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease 
characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, with 
evidence of subsequent metabolic syndrome disorder. Studies have demonstrated 
that as many as 42% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who are found to 
have high-grade dysplasia, either already had colorectal cancer (CRC) or develop 
it within a short time. The presence of low-grade dysplasia is also predictive 
of CRC. Many signaling pathways are shared among IBD and CRC, including cell 
survival, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammatory signaling pathways. 
Current IBD therapeutics target a small subset of molecular drivers of IBD, with 
many focused on the inflammatory aspect of the pathways. Thus, there is a great 
need to identify biomarkers of both IBD and CRC, that can be predictive of 
therapeutic efficacy, disease severity, and predisposition to CRC. In this 
study, we explored the changes in biomarkers specific for inflammatory, 
metabolic, and proliferative pathways, to help determine the relevance to both 
IBD and CRC. Our analysis demonstrated, for the first time in IBD, the loss of 
the tumor suppressor protein Ras associated family protein 1A (RASSF1A), via 
epigenetic changes, the hyperactivation of the obligate kinase of the NOD2 
pathogen recognition receptor (receptor interacting protein kinase 2 [RIPK2]), 
the loss of activation of the metabolic kinase, AMP activated protein kinase 
(AMPKÎ±1), and, lastly, the activation of the transcription factor and kinase Yes 
associated protein (YAP) kinase, that is involved in proliferation of cells. The 
expression and activation status of these four elements are mirrored in IBD, 
CRC, and IBD-CRC patients and, importantly, in matched blood and biopsy samples. 
The latter would suggest that biomarker analysis can be performed 
non-invasively, to understand IBD and CRC, without the need for invasive and 
costly endoscopic analysis. This study, for the first time, illustrates the need 
to understand IBD or CRC beyond an inflammatory perspective and the value of 
therapeutics directed to reset altered proliferative and metabolic states within 
the colon. The use of such therapeutics may truly drive patients into remission.
