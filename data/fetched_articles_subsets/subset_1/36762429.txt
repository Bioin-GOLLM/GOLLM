Targeted covalent inhibitors hold promise for drug discovery, particularly for 
kinases. Targeting the catalytic lysine of epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) has attracted attention as a new strategy to overcome resistance due to 
the emergence of C797S mutation. Sulfonyl fluoride derivatives able to inhibit 
EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S by sulfonylation of Lys745 have been reported. However, 
atomistic details of this process are still poorly understood. Here, we describe 
the mechanism of inhibition of an innovative class of compounds that covalently 
engage the catalytic lysine of EGFR, through a sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange 
(SuFEx) process, with the help of hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics 
(QM/MM) and path collective variables (PCVs) approaches. Our simulations 
identify the chemical determinants accounting for the irreversible activity of 
agents targeting Lys745 and provide hints for the further optimization of 
sulfonyl fluoride agents.
