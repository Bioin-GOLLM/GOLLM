BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increase risk of 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Among genetic factors that contributed 
to incidence of metabolic syndrome, Polymorphisms of Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) 
are major candidates especially because of their effect on obesity and 
dyslipidemia. S447X (rs328) and Hind III (rs320) Polymorphisms of LPL gene have 
been reported to change LPL activity, resulting in altered triglyceride (TG) and 
high density lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. This study investigates the 
effects of these gene polymorphisms on factors affecting metabolic syndrome in 
northern population of Iran.
METHODS: Studied population included 223 adults consisting 90 women and 133 men 
with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 as obese subjects, and 156 healthy 
participants as a control group with BMI <25 that included 68 women and 88 men. 
All factors causing metabolic syndrome were evaluated. Also DNA was extracted 
from blood samples and HindIII and S447X LPL gene polymorphisms were screened by 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method 
(PCR-RFLP).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study proves that some genotypes of S447X were 
associated with a reduced risk of developing low HDL-C only in men, while the 
protective effects of HindIII on hypertriglyceridemia were only seen in women 
[corrected]. The point is that this relation is affected by the weight profile 
of the participants. It can be concluded that there is a gender-related relation 
between the polymorphisms of LPL gene and the risk factors for incidence of 
metabolic syndrome in the northern population of Iran.
