Representatives of the closely related genera, Interfilum and Klebsormidium, are 
characterized by unicells, dyads or packets in Interfilum and contrasting 
uniseriate filaments in Klebsormidium. According to the literature, these 
distinct thallus forms originate by different types of cell division, 
sporulation (cytogony) versus vegetative cell division (cytotomy), but 
investigations of their morphology and ultrastructure show a high degree of 
similarity. Cell walls of both genera are characterized by triangular spaces 
between cell walls of neighbouring cells and the parental wall or central space 
among the walls of a cell packet, exfoliations and projections of the parental 
wall and cap-like and H-like fragments of the cell wall. In both genera, each 
cell has its individual cell wall and it also has part of the common parental 
wall or its remnants. Therefore, vegetative cells of Interfilum and 
Klebsormidium probably divide by the same type of cell division 
(sporulation-like). Various strains representing different species of the two 
genera are characterized by differences in cell wall ultrastructure, 
particularly the level of preservation, rupture or gelatinization of the 
parental wall surrounding the daughter cells. The differing morphologies of 
representatives of various lineages result from features of the parental wall 
during cell separation and detachment. Cell division in three planes (usual in 
Interfilum and a rare event in Klebsormidium) takes place in spherical or short 
cylindrical cells, with the chloroplast positioned perpendicularly or obliquely 
to the filament (dyad) axis. The morphological differences are mainly a 
consequence of differing fates of the parental wall after cell division and 
detachment. The development of different morphologies within the two genera 
mostly depends on characters such as the shape of cells, texture of cell walls, 
mechanical interactions between cells and the influence of environmental 
conditions.
