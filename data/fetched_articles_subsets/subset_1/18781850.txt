INTRODUCTION: Marked lowering of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
levels (< or =50%) with intensive statin therapy is associated with major 
reduction in cardiovascular risk, but is limited by a potential increase in 
adverse effects, thereby justifying optimization of LDL-C reduction with minimal 
risk. The organic anion transporting polypeptide-1B1 encoded by the SLCO1B1 gene 
is implicated as a major transporter in cellular uptake of statins, and notably 
fluvastatin. We postulated that genetic variation in SLCO1B1 might affect statin 
bioavailability, and might therefore influence drug response and potential 
adverse effects.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Elderly hypercholesterolemic subjects (n = 724), whose 
plasma lipid profile was determined before and 2 months after fluvastatin 
extended-release treatment (80 mg/day, n = 420), or placebo (n = 304), were 
genotyped for the most frequent nonsynonymous polymorphisms (SNP) in the SLCO1B1 
gene (c.388A>G, c.463C>A and c.521T>C).
RESULTS: Due to linkage disequilibrium, only four alleles (*1b, *5, *14 and *15) 
of SLCO1B1 were detected in addition to the wild-type allele (*1a). The c.463A 
genotype, which was systematically associated with the c.388G SNP corresponding 
to the *14 allele was significantly associated with percentage LDL-C reduction 
from baseline (p = 0.005) and with mean post-treatment LDL-C values (p = 
0.0005). Subjects homozygous for the c.463C genotype (n = 294) exhibited 
significantly less LDL-C reduction and higher post-treatment LDL-C levels 
(-31.5%, 138 mg/dl) relative to heterozygous C/A patients (-36.2%, 126 mg/dl; n 
= 111), and to homozygous A/A subjects (-41%, 115 mg/dl; n = 15).
CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal that OATP1B1 is implicated in the 
pharmacological action and efficacy of fluvastatin. Indeed, the common *14 
allele, which is distinguished by the presence of the c.463C>A polymorphism, was 
associated with enhanced lipid-lowering efficacy in this study.
