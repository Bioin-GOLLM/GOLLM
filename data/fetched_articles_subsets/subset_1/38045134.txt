BACKGROUND: CFTR nonsense alleles generate negligible CFTR protein due to the 
nonsense mutation: 1) triggering CFTR mRNA degradation by nonsense-mediated mRNA 
decay (NMD), and 2) terminating CFTR mRNA translation prematurely. Thus, people 
with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) who carry nonsense alleles cannot benefit from 
current modulator drugs, which target CFTR protein. In this study, we examined 
whether PTBP1 and HNRNPL, two RNA binding proteins that protect a subset of 
mRNAs with a long 3' untranslated region (UTR) from NMD, similarly affect CFTR 
mRNA.Silencing RNAs were used to deplete PTBP1 or HNRNPL in 16HBE14o- human 
bronchial epithelial cells expressing WT, G542X, or W1282X CFTR. CFTR mRNA 
abundance was measured relative to controls by quantitative PCR. PTBP1 and 
HNRNPL were also exogenously expressed in each cell line and CFTR mRNA levels 
were similarly quantified.
RESULTS: PTBP1 depletion reduced CFTR mRNA abundance in all three 16HBE14o- cell 
lines; HRNPL depletion reduced CFTR mRNA abundance in only the G542X and W1282X 
cell lines. Notably, decreased CFTR mRNA abundance correlated with increased 
mRNA decay. Exogenous expression of PTBP1 or HNRNPL increased CFTR mRNA 
abundance in all three cell lines; HNRNPL overexpression generally increased 
CFTR to a greater extent in G542X and W1282X 16HBE14o- cells.Our data indicate 
that PTBP1 and HNRNPL regulate CFTR mRNA abundance by protecting CFTR 
transcripts from NMD. This suggests that PTBP1 and/or HNRNPL may represent 
potential therapeutic targets to increase CFTR mRNA abundance and enhance 
responses to CFTR modulators and other therapeutic approaches in PwCF.
