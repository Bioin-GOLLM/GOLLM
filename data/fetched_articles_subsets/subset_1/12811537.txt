Glaucoma represents one of the most common eye diseases and is characterized by 
progressive loss of visual fields. In the more advanced stages bilateral 
blindness may result, due to optic nerve atrophy and an excavated optic nerve 
head. Open-angle glaucoma is one of the main disease subsets, which may be 
further divided into high tension primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and normal 
tension glaucoma (NTG). Recently, the optineurin ( OPTN) gene was identified as 
a causative factor for NTG. Alterations in this gene were found in Caucasian 
families with NTG. In particular, c.458G>A, c.691-692insAG and c.1944G>A were 
shown to be risk factors. Since NTG is reported to be the most common form of 
glaucoma in Japan, and to identify if the OPTN gene plays a role in POAG, the 
DNAs from 148 unrelated Japanese patients with NTG, 165 patients with POAG and 
196 unrelated controls who were not suffering glaucoma were investigated by 
appropriate genotyping techniques. No glaucoma-specific mutations were found in 
the OPTN gene in Japanese glaucoma patients. However, some novel 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the exons and introns are reported in 
this paper for the first time.
