A Chilean 35-year-old male patient with a history of primary infertility made an 
appointment at the Unit of Reproductive Medicine at Clínica Las Condes, 
Santiago, Chile. Multiple semen analyses revealed abnormal sperm morphology as 
the most prevalent finding. Multiflagellated and macrocephalic spermatozoa were 
observed and indicated a possible macrozoospermic phenotype. The constant 
presence of abnormal sperm morphology led the scope of the study to include 
Aurora Kinase C (AURKC) gene sequencing. The patient was diagnosed with a 
homozygous mutation of this gene. The mutation was detected in exon 6, type 
c.744C>G+/+ (P.Y248*) variant. As previously described in the Human Gene 
Mutation Database (HGMD), this pathogenic variant is associated with 
macrozoospermia. Although this mutation is not the most frequently observed, it 
is the first of its kind reported in Latin America.
