OBJECTIVES: Dental caries is a widespread multifactorial disease, caused by the 
demineralization of hard dental tissues. Susceptibility to dental caries is 
partially genetically conditioned; this study was aimed at finding an 
association of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding 
proteins involved in amelogenesis with this disease in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, 15 SNPs in ALOX15, AMBN, 
AMELX, KLK4, TFIP11, and TUFT1 genes were analyzed in 150 children with primary 
dentition and 611 children with permanent teeth with/without dental caries from 
the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC) cohort.
RESULTS: Dental caries in primary dentition was associated with SNPs in AMELX 
(rs17878486) and KLK4 (rs198968, rs2242670), and dental caries in permanent 
dentition with SNPs in AMELX (rs17878486) and KLK4 (rs2235091, rs2242670, 
rs2978642), (p ≤ 0.05). No significant differences between cases and controls 
were observed in the allele or genotype frequencies of any of the selected SNPs 
in ALOX15, AMBN, TFIP11, and TUFT1 genes (p > 0.05). Some KLK4 haplotypes were 
associated with dental caries in permanent dentition (p ≤ 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, we found that although the SNPs in AMELX and 
KLK4 are localized in intronic regions and their functional significance has not 
yet been determined, they are associated with susceptibility to dental caries in 
children.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: AMELX and KLK4 variants could be considered in the risk 
assessment of dental caries, especially in permanent dentition, in the European 
Caucasian population.
