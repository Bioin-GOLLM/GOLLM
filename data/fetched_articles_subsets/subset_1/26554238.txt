Hyperparathyroidism.

BACKGROUND: The CLDN14 gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation of 
paracellular permeability or ion transport at epithelial tight junctions as in 
the nephron. The C allele of the rs219780 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) 
of CLDN14 has been associated with renal lithiasis, high levels of parathormone 
(PTH), and with low bone mineral density (BMD) in healthy women. Our aim is to 
study the relationship between rs219780 SNP of CLDN14 and renal lithiasis, 
fractures, and BMD in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).
METHODS: We enrolled 298 Caucasian patients with PHPT and 328 healthy volunteers 
in a cross-sectional study. We analysed anthropometric data, history of 
fractures or kidney stones, biochemical parameters including markers for bone 
remodelling, abdominal ultrasound, and BMD and genotyping for the rs219780 SNP 
of CLDN14.
RESULTS: We did not find any difference in the frequency of fractures or renal 
lithiasis between the genotype groups in PHPT patients. Moreover, we did not 
find any relationship between the T or C alleles and BMD or biochemical 
parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: rs219780 SNP of CLDN14 does not appear to be a risk factor for the 
development of PHPT nor does it seem to influence the clinical expression of 
PHPT.
