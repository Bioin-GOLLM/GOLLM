Mutations in the KRAS gene occur frequently in various human tumors and are 
known to lead to malignant transformation. We isolated RNA aptamers targeting 
activated mutant KRAS proteins using an improved SELEX method by isothermal RNA 
amplification. RNA aptamers were selected against mutant KRAS (G12V) proteins, 
as well as a biotinylated 15-amino-acid peptide from the carboxyl terminal of 
KRAS that contains a farnesylation site. All the selected RNA aptamers bound to 
the basic carboxy-terminal region of KRAS protein and the highest K(D) value was 
2.3 microM. By an in vitro scintillation proximity assay, we demonstrated that 
KRAS aptamers inhibited farnesylation moderately. From these aptamers, we 
determined a consensus sequence (U)CCAAGCAC(AC) that, when concatamerized, 
exhibited higher binding affinity to the carboxy-terminal region of KRAS 
protein. Further improvement of binding affinity between aptamers and KRAS 
protein might provide a new therapeutic approach for activated mutant KRAS 
proteins.
