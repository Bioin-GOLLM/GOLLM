The carcinogens in cigarette smoke are distinct from asbestos. However, an 
understanding of their differential effects on lung adenocarcinoma development 
remains elusive. We investigated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and the p53 
mutation in 132 lung adenocarcinomas, for which asbestos body burden (AB; in 
numbers per gram of dry lung) was measured using adjacent normal lung. All cases 
were classified into 9 groups based on a matrix of cumulative smoking (CS in 
pack‑years; CS=0, 0<CS<25, ≥25 CS) and AB (AB=0, 0<AB<1,000, ≥1,000 AB). AB=0 
indicates a lower level than the detection limit of ~100. LOH frequency 
increased only slightly with the elevation of CS in the AB=0 groups. In the AB>0 
groups, LOH frequency increased as AB and/or CS was elevated and was 
significantly higher in the ≥1,000 AB, ≥25 CS group (p=0.032). p53 mutation 
frequency was the lowest in the AB=0, CS=0 group, increased as AB and/or CS 
rose, and was significantly higher in the ≥1,000 AB, ≥25 CS group (p=0.039). p53 
mutations characteristic of smoking were frequently observed in the CS>0 groups 
contrary to non-specific mutations in the CS=0, AB>0 groups. Combined effects of 
asbestos and smoking were suggested by LOH and p53 analyses. Sole exposure to 
asbestos did not increase LOH frequency but increased non‑specific p53 
mutations. These findings indicate that the major carcinogenic mechanism of 
asbestos may be tumor promotion, acting in an additive or synergistic manner, 
contributing to the genotoxic effect of smoking. Since this study was based on a 
general cancer center's experience, the limited sample size did not permit the 
consideration that the result was conclusive. Further investigation with a large 
sample size is needed to establish the mechanism of asbestos-induced lung 
carcinogenesis.
