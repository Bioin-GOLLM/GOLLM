Cohesin is a conserved, ring-shaped protein complex that topologically embraces 
DNA. Its central role in genome organization includes functions in sister 
chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. Cohesin loading 
onto chromosomes requires the Scc2-Scc4 cohesin loader, whose presence on 
chromatin in budding yeast depends on the RSC chromatin remodeling complex. Here 
we reveal a dual role of RSC in cohesin loading. RSC acts as a chromatin 
receptor that recruits Scc2-Scc4 by a direct protein interaction independent of 
chromatin remodeling. In addition, chromatin remodeling is required to generate 
a nucleosome-free region that is the substrate for cohesin loading. An 
engineered cohesin loading module can be created by fusing the Scc2 C terminus 
to RSC or to other chromatin remodelers, but not to unrelated DNA binding 
proteins. These observations demonstrate the importance of nucleosome-free DNA 
for cohesin loading and provide insight into how cohesin accesses DNA during its 
varied chromosomal activities.
