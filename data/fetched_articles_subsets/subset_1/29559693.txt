Osteoarthritis is a common complex disease imposing a large public-health 
burden. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study for osteoarthritis, 
using data across 16.5 million variants from the UK Biobank resource. After 
performing replication and meta-analysis in up to 30,727 cases and 297,191 
controls, we identified nine new osteoarthritis loci, in all of which the most 
likely causal variant was noncoding. For three loci, we detected association 
with biologically relevant radiographic endophenotypes, and in five signals we 
identified genes that were differentially expressed in degraded compared with 
intact articular cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis. We established 
causal effects on osteoarthritis for higher body mass index but not for 
triglyceride levels or genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.
