In the last three decades cutaneous melanoma has been widely investigated as a 
steroid hormone-sensitive cancer. Following this hypothesis, many 
epidemiological studies have investigated the relationship between estrogens and 
melanoma. No evidence to date has supported this association due to the great 
complexity of genetic, external and environmental factors underlying the 
development of this cancer. Molecular mechanisms through which estrogen and 
their receptor exert a role in melanoma genesis are still under investigation 
with new studies increasingly focusing on the discovery of new molecular targets 
for therapeutic treatments.
