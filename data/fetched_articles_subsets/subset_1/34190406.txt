The mechanism of intervertebral disc degeneration is still unclear, and there 
are no effective therapeutic strategies for treating this condition. miRNAs are 
naturally occurring macromolecules in the human body and have many biological 
functions. Therefore, we hope to elucidate whether miRNAs are associated with 
intervertebral disc degeneration and the underlying mechanisms involved. In our 
study, differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted by the GEO database and 
then confirmed by qPCR and in situ hybridization. Apoptosis of nucleus pulposus 
cells was detected by flow cytometry and Bcl2, Bax and caspase 3. Deposition of 
extracellular matrix was assessed by Alcian blue staining, and the expression of 
COX2 and MMP13 was detected by immunofluorescence, Western blot and qPCR. 
Moreover, qPCR was used to detect the expression of miR27a and its precursors. 
The results showed that miR27a was rarely expressed in healthy intervertebral 
discs but showed increased expression in degenerated intervertebral discs. 
Ectopic miR27a expression inhibited apoptosis, suppressed the inflammatory 
response and attenuated the catabolism of the extracellular matrix by targeting 
FSTL1. Furthermore, it seems that the expression of miR27a was up-regulated by 
TNF-α via the P38 signalling pathway. So we conclude that TNF-α and FSTL1 engage 
in a positive feedback loop to promote intervertebral disc degeneration. At the 
same time, miR27a is up-regulated by TNF-α via the P38 signalling pathway, which 
ameliorates inflammation, apoptosis and matrix degradation by targeting FSTL1. 
Thus, this negative feedback mechanism might contribute to the maintenance of a 
low degeneration load and would be beneficial to maintain a persistent chronic 
disc degeneration.
