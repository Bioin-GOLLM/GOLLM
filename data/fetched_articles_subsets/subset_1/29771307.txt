Rosacea is a common, chronic skin disease of variable severity with limited 
treatment options. The cause of rosacea is unknown, but it is believed to be due 
to a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. Little is known about 
the genetics of the disease. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
of rosacea symptom severity with data from 73 265 research participants of 
European ancestry from the 23andMe customer base. Seven loci had variants 
associated with rosacea at the genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10-8). 
Further analyses highlighted likely gene regions or effector genes including 
IRF4 (P = 1.5 × 10-17), a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region flanked by PSMB9 
and HLA-DMB (P = 2.2 × 10-15), HERC2-OCA2 (P = 4.2 × 10-12), SLC45A2 
(P = 1.7 × 10-10), IL13 (P = 2.8 × 10-9), a region flanked by NRXN3 and DIO2 
(P = 4.1 × 10-9), and a region flanked by OVOL1and SNX32 (P = 1.2 × 10-8). All 
associations with rosacea were novel except for the HLA locus. Two of these loci 
(HERC-OCA2 and SLC45A2) and another precedented variant (rs1805007 in 
melanocortin 1 receptor) with an association P value just below the significance 
threshold (P = 1.3 × 10-7) have been previously associated with skin phenotypes 
and pigmentation, two of these loci are linked to immuno-inflammation phenotypes 
(IL13 and PSMB9-HLA-DMA) and one has been associated with both categories 
(IRF4). Genes within three loci (PSMB9-HLA-DMA, HERC-OCA2 and NRX3-DIO2) were 
differentially expressed in a previously published clinical rosacea 
transcriptomics study that compared lesional to non-lesional samples. The 
identified loci provide specificity of inflammatory mechanisms in rosacea, and 
identify potential pathways for therapeutic intervention.
