OBJECTIVES: Small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) which has a small LDL 
particle size with greater susceptibility to oxidation is regarded as a risk 
marker for cardiovascular disease. The diacron reactive oxygen metabolites 
(d-ROMs) test has recently been introduced as an oxidative stress-related marker 
in the clinic. The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation 
between the mean LDL particle size and the oxidative stress status as evaluated 
by the d-ROMs in dyslipidemic patients.
METHODS: The study included 278 dyslipidemic patients (121 male and 157 female, 
mean age, 60 years). Clinical data including the conventional atherosclerotic 
risk factors in addition to the mean LDL particle size measured with the gel 
electrophoresis and the d-ROMs were collected.
RESULTS: Male patients had a significantly smaller mean LDL particle size than 
females (262.2 ± 7.5 [SD] vs. 264.3 ± 6.7 Å, P<0.05), while female patients had 
a significantly higher d-ROMs level than males (318 ± 68 vs. 350 ± 72 U. Carr., 
P<0.01). A multiple regression analysis revealed that there was an independent, 
significant, and inverse correlation between the mean LDL particle size and the 
d-ROMs (β=-0.19, P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings of the co-existence of both markers suggest that 
sdLDL and oxidative stress can be cooperative in atherogenesis, possibly leading 
to the incidence of CVD, in dyslipidemic patients.
