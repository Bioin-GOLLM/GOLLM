Warmblood Fragile Foal syndrome (WFFS) is an autosomal recessive condition that 
affects the maturation of collagen in affected foals. Foals affected with the 
disease typically die or are euthanised shortly after birth. WFFS is caused by a 
single nucleotide change at position 2032 of the equine PLOD1 gene, causing an 
impairment of the wild-type enzyme. A commercial test for the causative genetic 
mutation is currently available from companies operating under licence from 
Cornell University but it has limitations. This test requires amplification of a 
region of the PLOD1 gene encompassing the site of interest, followed by Sanger 
sequencing of that region and computational analysis. We describe here the 
development of an alternative, real-time PCR based assay that rapidly and 
reliably differentiates between the wild-type and WFFS associated nucleotides 
without the need for sequencing, thus increasing the potential for high 
throughput analysis of large numbers of samples in a cost-effective manner.
