The presence of asbestos bodies (ABs) in lung parenchyma is considered a 
histopathologic hallmark of past exposure to asbestos fibers, of which there was 
a population of longer fibers. The mechanisms underlying AB formation are 
complex, involving inflammatory responses and iron (Fe) metabolism. Thus, the 
responsiveness to AB formation is variable, with some individuals appearing to 
be poor AB formers. The aim of this study was to disclose the possible role of 
genetic variants of genes encoding inflammasome and iron metabolism proteins in 
the ability to form ABs in a population of 81 individuals from North East Italy, 
who died after having developed malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). This study 
included 86 genetic variants distributed in 10 genes involved in Fe metabolism 
and 7 genetic variants in two genes encoding for inflammasome molecules. 
Genotypes/haplotypes were compared according to the number of lung ABs. Data 
showed that the NLRP1 rs12150220 missense variant (H155L) was significantly 
correlated with numbers of ABs in MPM patients. Specifically, a low number of 
ABs was detected in individuals carrying the NLRP1 rs12150220 A/T genotype. Our 
findings suggest that the NLRP1 inflammasome might contribute in the development 
of lung ABs. It is postulated that the NLRP1 missense variant may be considered 
as one of the possible host genetic factors contributing to individual 
variability in coating efficiency, which needs to be taken when assessing 
occupational exposure to asbestos.
