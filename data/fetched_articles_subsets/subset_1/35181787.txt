Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) are a widely expressed class of 
enzymes responsible for catalyzing arginine methylation on numerous protein 
substrates. Among them, type I PRMTs are responsible for generating asymmetric 
dimethylarginine. By controlling multiple basic cellular processes, such as DNA 
damage responses, transcriptional regulation, and mRNA splicing, type I PRMTs 
contribute to cancer initiation and progression. A type I PRMT inhibitor, 
GSK3368715, has been developed and has entered clinical trials for solid and 
hematologic malignancies. Although type I PRMTs have been reported to play roles 
in modulating immune cell function, the immunologic role of tumor-intrinsic 
pathways controlled by type I PRMTs remains uncharacterized. Here, our The 
Cancer Genome Atlas dataset analysis revealed that expression of type I PRMTs 
associated with poor clinical response and decreased immune infiltration in 
patients with melanoma. In cancer cell lines, inhibition of type I PRMTs induced 
an IFN gene signature, amplified responses to IFN and innate immune signaling, 
and decreased expression of the immunosuppressive cytokine VEGF. In 
immunocompetent mouse tumor models, including a model of T-cell exclusion that 
represents a common mechanism of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) 
resistance in humans, type I PRMT inhibition increased T-cell infiltration, 
produced durable responses dependent on CD8+ T cells, and enhanced efficacy of 
anti-PD-1 therapy. These data indicate that type I PRMT inhibition exhibits 
immunomodulatory properties and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) 
to induce durable antitumor responses in a T cell-dependent manner, suggesting 
that type I PRMT inhibition can potentiate an antitumor immunity in refractory 
settings.
