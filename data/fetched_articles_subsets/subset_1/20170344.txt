BACKGROUND: 17alpha-Hydroxylase deficiency (17OHD) is a rare disease of 
congenital adrenal hyperplasia. It is characterised by hypertension, 
hypokalaemia, primary amenorrhoea. Deficiency of P450c17 enzyme is caused by 
mutation of the CYP17 gene.
CASE: A 16-year-old female with genotypic 46, XY suffered from 17OHD. She 
presented with primary amenorrhoea, lack of secondary sexual characteristics, 
and hypertension. Laboratory tests showed hypokalaemia, low levels of androgens 
(testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone), corticosteroid, and high levels of 
adrenocorticotropic hormone and progesterone. A P409R mutation was found in 
exon7 of CYP17 gene, revealing homozygosis and confirming diagnosis of 17OHD.
CONCLUSION: 17OHD is a rare disease associated with primary amenorrhoea and 
hypertension. Identification of mutation in CYP17 gene can help to a better 
understanding of this enzyme deficiency.
