BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are associated 
with leptomeningeal metastases (LM) of nonsmall cell lung cancer and sensitivity 
to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. Owing to the difficulty of 
obtaining carcinomatous meningeal tissue for analysis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
might be an alternative.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the EGFR mutation detection in the CSF of lung 
adenocarcinoma patients with LM.
METHODS: Twenty-five lung adenocarcinoma patients with LM diagnosed by CSF 
cytology were retrospectively evaluated. The results of EGFR mutation detection 
in CSF, the treatment plan, and clinical outcome information were recorded.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients had a known EGFR status in their primary tumors. 
Twenty patients received EGFR mutation analysis in CSF after LM diagnosis and 14 
of them with a known EGFR mutation status of both primary tumors and CSF. Ten 
(71.4%) had the same EGFR gene status. In primary tumors, no T790M mutations 
were detected, whereas in CSF, 2 L858R cases and 1 19del case had T790M 
mutations at the same time. The detection rate of T790M mutations in CSF was 
18.1% (2 of 11) in all cases with EGFR-sensitive mutations in the primary 
lesion.
CONCLUSIONS: EGFR mutation detection in CSF of lung adenocarcinoma patients with 
LM might be an alternative when leptomeningeal biopsy cannot be applied and may 
help to guide TKI treatments.
