PURPOSE: To investigate the association between the vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) gene and response to either intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) or 
photodynamic therapy with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide and IVB (triple 
therapy) for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
METHODS: The study consisted of 94 patients with neovascular AMD who underwent 
IVB and 79 patients with neovascular AMD who underwent triple therapy. Genotypes 
were determined for four selected tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s 
of the VEGF gene.
RESULTS: Of the four SNPs studied, one SNP (rs699946) was associated 
significantly with visual acuity (VA) changes 12 months after 
treatment-irrespective of whether they received IVB alone (P = 0.044) or triple 
therapy 0.010). Baseline VA was not significantly different among the three 
genotypes of rs699946 in either treatment group. There were no significant 
differences in the number of treatments, incidence of recurrence, or the period 
until the recurrence according to VEGF rs699946 genetic variant.
CONCLUSIONS: The VEGF gene SNP rs699946 was associated with response to IVB 
alone and to triple therapy in this study. The G allele in SNP rs699946 can thus 
be applied as a marker for better visual prognosis in patients with neovascular 
AMD who receive either IVB or triple therapy.
