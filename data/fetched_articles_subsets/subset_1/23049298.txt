BACKGROUND: Real time PCR has become the most common technique to monitor 
BCR-ABL transcript levels of patients treated with kinase inhibitors. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate BCR-ABL levels of chronic myeloid leukemia patients 
treated with imatinib in the chronic phase and correlate the response to therapy 
and event-free survival.
METHODS: BCR-ABL levels were measured in peripheral blood cell samples using 
Real time PCR at diagnosis and then every 3 months after starting therapy with 
imatinib. Major molecular response was defined as a three-log reduction from the 
standardized baseline value. Major molecular response values were adjusted to 
international scale using a conversion factor of 1.19. The results are reported 
as a BCR-ABL/ABL ratio (%).
RESULTS: Hematological, major cytogenetic and complete cytogenetic responses 
were achieved by 57 (95%), 45 (75%) and 38 (63%) patients, respectively. 
Twenty-four out of sixty patients achieved a major molecular response (40%) in a 
median time of 8.5 months. Overall survival and event free survival were higher 
for patients with (100%) versus patients without (77%) a complete cytogenetic 
response (p-value = 0.01) at 48 months. Patients with complete cytogenetic 
response and major molecular response had a higher event free survival compared 
to patients with complete cytogenetic response but without major molecular 
response (p-value = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the prognostic impact of achieving complete 
cytogenetic response and a major molecular response and also the importance of 
molecular monitoring in the follow-up of chronic myeloid leukemia patients were 
demonstrated.s.
