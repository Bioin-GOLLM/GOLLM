The significance of many BRCA unclassified variants (UVs) has not been 
evaluated. Classification of these variations as neutral or pathogenic presents 
a significant challenge and has important implications for breast and ovarian 
cancer genetic counseling. Here we report a combined molecular and computational 
approach to classify BRCA UVs missense variations. By using the LOH (Loss of 
heterozygosity) analysis at the BRCA1/BRCA2 loci, five bioinformatics approaches 
namely fathmm, PhD-SNP, SNAP, MutationTaster and Human Splicing Finder and the 
association with the clinico-pathological characteristics related to BRCA 
tumors, we were able to classify the R2787H (in BRCA2 gene) variant as 
pathogenic. Then, to investigate the functional role of the R2787H variation in 
altering BRCA2 structure, the homology model of this variant was constructed 
using the Rattus norvegicus BRCA2 (PDB ID: 1IYJ) as a template. The predicted 
model was then assessed for stereochemical quality and side chain environment. 
Furthermore, docking and binding free energy simulations were performed to 
investigate the ssDNA-BRCA2 complex interaction. Binding energy value 
calculation proves that this substitution affects the complex stability. 
Moreover, this alteration was not found in one hundred healthy controls. These 
findings suggest that R2787H variant could have potential functional impact. Our 
approach might be useful for evaluation of BRCA unclassified variants. However 
additional functional analyzes may provide appropriate assessment to classify 
such variants.
