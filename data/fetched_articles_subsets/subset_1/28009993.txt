RNA editing results in post-transcriptional modification and could potentially 
contribute to carcinogenesis. However, RNA editing in advanced lung 
adenocarcinomas has not yet been studied. Based on whole genome and 
transcriptome sequencing data, we identified 1,071,296 RNA editing events from 
matched normal, primary and metastatic samples contributed by 24 lung 
adenocarcinoma patients, with 91.3% A-to-G editing on average, and found 
significantly more RNA editing sites in tumors than in normal samples. To 
investigate cancer relevant editing events, we detected 67,851 hyper-editing 
sites in primary and 50,480 hyper-editing sites in metastatic samples. 46 genes 
with hyper-editing in coding regions were found to result in amino acid 
alterations, while hundreds of hyper-editing events in non-coding regions could 
modulate splicing or gene expression, including genes related to tumor stage or 
clinic prognosis. Comparing RNA editome of primary and metastatic samples, we 
also discovered hyper-edited genes that may promote metastasis development. 
These findings showed a landscape of RNA editing in matched normal, primary and 
metastatic tissues of lung adenocarcinomas for the first time and provided new 
insights to understand the molecular characterization of this disease.
