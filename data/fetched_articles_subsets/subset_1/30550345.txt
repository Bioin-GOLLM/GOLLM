OBJECTIVE: The LixiLan clinical trials of insulin glargine (iGlar)/lixisenatide 
fixed-ratio combination (iGlarLixi) investigated the safety and efficacy of 
iGlarLixi versus iGlar: LixiLan-O (NCT02058147) in patients with type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) and LixiLan-L 
(NCT02058160) in patients with T2D inadequately controlled on basal 
insulin ± OADs. In these two trials, both iGlar and iGlarLixi were titrated to a 
maximum (capped) dose of 60 units. We evaluated whether this may have affected 
the reported glycemic efficacy of iGlar, and the glycemic differences observed 
between treatment with iGlarLixi and iGlar.
METHODS: The efficacy of iGlar under uncapped conditions was simulated in a 
two-step approach. First, a model characterizing the relationship between iGlar 
dose and fasting self-measured plasma glucose (f-SMPG) was developed. Then, the 
relationship between glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and f-SMPG was established to 
translate simulated f-SMPG responses to A1C responses.
RESULTS: Most patients achieved stable f-SMPG at ∼60 units/day, with no further 
reduction with increasing insulin dose. In comparisons of observed/capped and 
simulated/uncapped changes in mean A1C from baseline to Week 30, iGlarLixi 
consistently demonstrated treatment benefit compared with iGlar. Uncapping 
resulted in a slightly higher mean iGlar dose in both LixiLan-O (+0.72 units) 
and LixiLan-L (+2.1 units), without marked impact on f-SMPG or A1C change from 
baseline.
CONCLUSION: Uncapping the iGlar dose in LixiLan-O and LixiLan-L would not have 
led to significant improvements in mean A1C reduction in the iGlar arm, 
supporting the conclusion that iGlarLixi provides additional, clinically 
relevant glycemic control versus iGlar alone.
