Patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection who have persistently 
normal alanine aminotransferase levels (PNALT) have mild inflammation and 
fibrosis in comparison to those with elevated ALT levels. The cellular immune 
responses to HCV are mainly responsible for viral clearance and the disease 
pathogenesis during infection. However, since the innate and adaptive immune 
systems are suppressed by various kinds of mechanisms in CHC patients, the 
immunopathogenesis of CHC patients with PNALT is still unclear. In this review, 
we summarize the representative reports about the immune suppression in CHC to 
better understand the immunopathogenesis of PNALT. Then, we summarize and 
speculate on the immunological aspects of PNALT including innate and adaptive 
immune systems and genetic polymorphisms of HLA and cytokines.
