Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) are associated with 
familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 is a complex protein that 
consists of multiple domains, including 13 putative armadillo-type repeats at 
the N-terminus. In this study, we analyzed the functional and molecular 
consequences of a novel variant, E193K, identified in an Italian family. E193K 
substitution does not influence LRRK2 kinase activity. Instead it affects LRRK2 
biochemical properties, such as phosphorylation at Ser935 and affinity for 
14-3-3ε. Primary fibroblasts obtained from an E193K carrier demonstrated 
increased cellular toxicity and abnormal mitochondrial fission upon 
1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium treatment. We found that E193K alters LRRK2 binding 
to DRP1, a crucial mediator of mitochondrial fission. Our data support a role 
for LRRK2 as a scaffolding protein influencing mitochondrial fission.
