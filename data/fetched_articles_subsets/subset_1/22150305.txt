Although adults with Down syndrome (DS) show a decreased incidence of cancer 
compared to individuals without DS, children with DS are at an increased risk of 
leukemia. Nearly half of these childhood leukemias are classified as acute 
megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), a relatively rare subtype of acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML). Here, we summarize the clinical features of myeloid leukemia in 
DS, review recent research on the mechanisms of leukemogenesis, including the 
roles of GATA1 mutations and trisomy 21, and discuss treatment strategies. Given 
that trisomy 21 is a relatively common event in hematologic malignancies, 
greater knowledge of how the genes on chromosome 21 contribute to DS-AMKL will 
increase our understanding of a broader class of patients with leukemia.
