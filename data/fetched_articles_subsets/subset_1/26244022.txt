BACKGROUND: Accumulated studies have evaluated the association of pre-miR-218 
rs11134527 polymorphism with cancer risk in Chinese population. However, the 
results remain controversial.
METHODS: To derive a more precise and more comprehensive estimation of the 
relationship, six studies focused on Chinese population were included for the 
pooled analysis for pre-miR-218 rs11134527 polymorphism using odds ratios (ORs) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Pre-miR-218 rs11134527 polymorphism was associated with cancer risk (G 
versus A, OR =0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.98; GG versus AG + AA, OR =0.88, 95% CI: 
0.79-0.97; GG versus AA, OR =0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.96). In the stratified 
analysis by cancer type, the pre-miR-218 rs11134527 polymorphism was only 
associated with the risk of cervical cancer (G versus A, OR =0.90, 95% CI: 
0.83-0.98; GG versus AG + AA, OR =0.80, 95% CI: 0.68-0.94; GG versus AA, OR 
=0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.94).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the pre-miR-218 rs11134527 genetic 
polymorphism may decrease the susceptibility to cervical cancer, which needs to 
be verified or linked with functional studies.
