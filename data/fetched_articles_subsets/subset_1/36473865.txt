Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein (CHD) family plays critical roles in 
regulating gene transcription. The family is linked to cancer disease, but the 
family member's role in tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we report 
that CHD6 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC). CHD6 knockdown 
inhibited cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis. 
Consistently, Villin-specific Chd6 knockout in mice attenuates cancer formation 
in AOM/DSS model. We found that aberrant EGF signals promoted the stability of 
CHD6 by diminishing ubiquitin-mediated degradation. EGF signal inhibits GSK3β 
activity, which in turn prevents phosphodegron formation of CHD6, thereby 
hindering E3 ligase FBXW7-mediated CHD6 ubiquitination and degradation. CHD6's 
chromatin remodeler activity engages in binding Wnt signaling transcription 
factor TCF4 to facilitate the transcriptional expression of TMEM65, a 
mitochondrial inner membrane protein involved in ATP production and 
mitochondrial dynamics. In addition, Wnt signaling is also an upstream regulator 
of CHD6. CHD6 promoter contains TCF4 and β-catenin binding site, and CHD6 can be 
transcriptionally activated by Wnt ligand to facilitate TMEM65 transcription. 
Thus CHD6-TMEM65 axis can be regulated by both EGF and Wnt signaling pathways 
through two different mechanisms. We further illustrate that CHD6-TMEM65 axis is 
deregulated in cancer and that co-administration of Wnt inhibitor LGK974 and the 
anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab largely restricted the growth of 
patient-derived xenografts of CRC. Targeting CHD6-TMEM65 axis may be effective 
for cancer intervention.
