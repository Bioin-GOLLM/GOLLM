Sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2) belongs to solute 
carrier 38 (SLC38) family of transporters, which is ubiquitously expressed in 
mammalian tissues and mediates transport of small, neutral amino acids, 
exemplified by alanine(Ala, A). Yet structural data on SNAT2, including the 
relevance of intrinsic cysteine residues on structure and function, is scarce, 
in spite of its essential roles in many tissues. To better define the potential 
of intrinsic cysteines to form disulfide bonds in SNAT2, mutagenesis experiments 
and thiol-specific chemical modifications by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and 
methoxy-polyethylene glycol maleimide (mPEG-Mal, MW 5000) were performed, with 
or without the reducing regent dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment. Seven single 
mutant transporters with various cysteine (Cys, C) to alanine (Ala, A) 
substitutions, and a C245,279A double mutant were introduced to SNAT2 with a 
hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the C-terminus. The results showed that the cells 
expressing C245A or C279A were labeled by one equivalent of mPEG-Mal in the 
presence of DTT, while wild-type or all the other single Cys to Ala mutants were 
modified by two equivalents of mPEG-Mal. Furthermore, the molecular weight of 
C245,279A was not changed in the presence or absence of DTT treatment. The 
results suggest a disulfide bond between Cys245 and Cys279 in SNAT2 which has no 
effect on cell surface trafficking, as well as transporter function. The 
proposed disulfide bond may be important to delineate proximity in the 
extracellular domain of SNAT2 and related proteins.
