Cervical cancer is a common gynecologic cancer and a frequent cause of death. In 
this study, we investigated the role of MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper 
kinase) in cervical cancer. We found that HPV 18 E6/E7 promoted MELK expression 
by activating E2F1. MELK knockdown blocked cancer cells growth. Furthermore, we 
used MELK-8A to inhibit the kinase activity of MELK and caused the G2/M phase 
arrest of cancer cells. Under the treatment of inhibitors, Hela cells formed 
multipolar spindles and eventually underwent apoptosis. We also found that MELK 
is involved in protein translation and folding during cell division through the 
MELK interactome and the temporal proteomic analysis under inhibition with 
MELK-8A. Altogether, these results suggest that MELK may play a vital role in 
cancer cell proliferation and indicate a potential therapeutic target for 
cervical cancer.
