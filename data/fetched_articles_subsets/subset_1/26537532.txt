The catalysis of reactions involving fluoropyruvate as donor by N-acetyl 
neuraminic acid lyase (NAL) variants was investigated. Under kinetic control, 
the wild-type enzyme catalysed the reaction between fluoropyruvate and N-acetyl 
mannosamine to give a 90 : 10 ratio of the (3R,4R)- and (3S,4R)-configured 
products; after extended reaction times, equilibration occurred to give a 
30 : 70 mixture of these products. The efficiency and stereoselectivity of 
reactions of a range of substrates catalysed by the E192N, E192N/T167V/S208V and 
E192N/T167G NAL variants were also studied. Using fluoropyruvate and (2R,3S)- or 
(2S,3R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxo-N,N-dipropylbutanamide as substrates, it was 
possible to obtain three of the four possible diastereomeric products; for each 
product, the ratio of anomeric and pyranose/furanose forms was determined. The 
crystal structure of S. aureus NAL in complex with fluoropyruvate was 
determined, assisting rationalisation of the stereochemical outcome of C-C bond 
formation.
