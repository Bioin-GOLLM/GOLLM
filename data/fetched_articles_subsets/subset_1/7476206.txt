Each cysteine residue in the MerT and MerP polypeptides of bacterial transposon 
Tn501 was replaced by serine, and the mercury-resistance phenotypes of the 
mutants were determined in Escherichia coli. Cys-24 and Cys-25 in the first 
transmembrane region of MerT were essential for transport of mercuric ions 
through the cytoplasmic membrane, and mutations Cys-76-Ser, Cys-82-Ser or 
Gly-38-Asp in MerT or Cys-36-Ser in MerP all reduced transport and resistance. 
Deletion of the merP gene slightly reduced mercuric ion resistance and 
transport, whereas a Cys-33-Ser mutation in MerP appears to block transport of 
mercuric ions by MerT. The effects of deleting merP on mutations in merT were 
tested. The 116-amino-acid MerT protein is sufficient for mercuric ion transport 
across the cytoplasmic membrane.
