Background: Polycythemia Vera (PV) is a type of typical Myeloproliferative 
Neoplasms (MPNs) characterized with excessive erythropoiesis and thrombosis. 
Anoikis is a special programmed cell death mode induced by the adhesion disorder 
between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) or adjacent cells facilitating 
cancer metastasis. However, few studies have focused on the role of anoikis in 
PV, especially on the development of PV. Methods: The microarray and RNA-seq 
results were screened from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the 
anoikis-related genes (ARGs) were downloaded from Genecards. The functional 
enrichment analysis of intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were performed to discover 
hub genes. The hub genes expression was tested in the training (GSE136335) and 
validation cohort (GSE145802), and RT-qPCR was performed to verify the gene 
expression in PV mice. Results: In the training GSE136335, a total of 1,195 DEGs 
was obtained from Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) patients compared with 
controls, among which 58 were anoikis-related DEGs. The significant enrichment 
of the apoptosis and cell adhesion pathways (i.e., cadherin binding) were shown 
in functional enrichment analysis. The PPI network was conducted to identify top 
five hub genes (CASP3, CYCS, HIF1A, IL1B, MCL1). The expression of CASP3 and 
IL1B were significantly upregulated both in validation cohort and PV mice and 
downregulated after treatment, suggesting that CASP3 and IL1B could be important 
indicators for disease surveillance. Conclusion: Our research revealed a 
relationship between anoikis and PV for the first time by combined analysis of 
gene level, protein interaction and functional enrichment, allowing novel 
insights into mechanisms of PV. Moreover, CASP3 and IL1B may become promising 
indicators of PV development and treatment.
