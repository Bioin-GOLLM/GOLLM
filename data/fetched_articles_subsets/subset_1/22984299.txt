This paper examines a fundamental, though relatively understudied, aspect of the 
physical theory of the physician Asclepiades of Bithynia, namely his doctrine of 
pores. My principal thesis is that this doctrine is dependent on a conception of 
void taken directly from Epicurean physics. The paper falls into two parts: the 
first half addresses the evidence for the presence of void in Asclepiades' 
theory, and concludes that his conception of void was basically that of 
Epicurus; the second half focuses on the precise nature of Asclepiadean pores, 
and seeks to show that they represent void interstices between the primary 
particles of matter which are the constituents of the human body, and are thus 
exactly analogous to the void interstices between atoms within solid objects in 
Epicurus' theory.
