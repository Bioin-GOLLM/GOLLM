PURPOSE: The tyrosine kinase c-Abl localizes to the mitochondria under cell 
stress conditions and promotes apoptosis. However, c-Abl has not been directly 
targeted to the mitochondria. Fusing c-Abl to a mitochondrial translocation 
signal (MTS) that is activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) will selectively 
target the mitochondria of cancer cells exhibiting an elevated ROS phenotype. 
Mitochondrially targeted c-Abl will thereby induce malignant cell death.
METHODS: Confocal microscopy was used to determine mitochondrial colocalization 
of ectopically expressed c-Abl-EGFP/cMTS fusion across three cell lines (K562, 
Cos-7, and 1471.1) with varying levels of basal (and pharmacologically 
modulated) ROS. ROS were quantified by indicator dye assay. The functional 
consequences of mitochondrial c-Abl were assessed by DNA accessibility to 7-AAD 
using flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The cMTS and cMTS/c-Abl fusions colocalized to the mitochondria in 
leukemic (K562) and breast (1471.1) cancer phenotypes (but not Cos-7 
fibroblasts) in a ROS and PKC dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirm and extend oxidative stress activated translocation of 
the cMTS by demonstrating that the cMTS and Abl/cMTS fusion selectively target 
the mitochondria of K562 leukemia and mammary adenocarcinoma 1471.1 cells. c-Abl 
induced K562 leukemia cell death when targeted to the matrix but not the outer 
membrane of the mitochondria.
