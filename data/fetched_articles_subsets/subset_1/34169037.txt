Background: To quantitatively estimate the relationship between IL-1β -511C>T, 
-31T>C, and +3954C>T polymorphisms and risk of gestational disorders. Methods: 
In this meta-analysis, eligible publications were searched in Web of Knowledge, 
MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases (updated April 2020), 
using appropriate or relevant keywords. Case-control population-based reports 
were included if provided with genotypic frequencies of both studied groups. 
Statistical analyses were performed using the MetaGenyo web tool software, where 
a P value less than 0.05 indicated a significant association. For the assessment 
of between-study variations, heterogeneity analysis was applied with the I2 
statistics. Results: A total of thirteen studies were included. We observed a 
significant association between IL-1β-31T>C polymorphism and reduced risk of 
gestational disorders under codominant CT vs. CC [OR= 0.74, CI (0.59-0.92)], and 
dominant CT+TT vs. CC [OR= 0.74, CI (0.60-0.91)] contrasted genetic models. The 
stratified analysis considering the disease type showed that the 511C>T variant, 
under the recessive CC vs. CT+TT model, enhanced the risk of preterm birth by 
1.29 fold. Conclusion: Our results failed to support an association between two 
IL-1β polymorphisms, 511C>T and +3954C>T, with the overall risk of gestational 
disorders. In contrast, the 31T>C variant reduced the incidence of such 
diseases. Further studies are encouraged to get more precise estimates of effect 
sizes.
