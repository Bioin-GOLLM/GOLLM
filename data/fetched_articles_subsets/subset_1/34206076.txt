Novel symmetrical bis-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines and bis-purines and their 
monomers were synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity in 
human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), cervical carcinoma (HeLa), ductal pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma (CFPAC-1) and metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma (SW620) cells. 
The use of ultrasound irradiation as alternative energy input in Cu(I)-catalyzed 
azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) shortened the reaction time, increased the 
reaction efficiency and led to the formation of exclusively symmetric 
bis-heterocycles. DFT calculations showed that triazole formation is exceedingly 
exergonic and confirmed that the presence of Cu(I) ions is required to overcome 
high kinetic requirements and allow the reaction to proceed. The influence of 
various linkers and 6-substituted purine and regioisomeric 7-deazapurine on 
their cytostatic activity was revealed. Among all the evaluated compounds, the 
4-chloropyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine monomer 5f with 4,4'-bis(oxymethylene)biphenyl 
had the most pronounced, although not selective, growth-inhibitory effect on 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (CFPAC-1) cells (IC50 = 0.79 µM). Annexin V assay 
results revealed that its strong growth inhibitory activity against CFPAC-1 
cells could be associated with induction of apoptosis and primary necrosis. 
Further structural optimization of bis-chloropyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine with 
aromatic linker is required to develop novel efficient and non-toxic agent 
against pancreatic cancer.
