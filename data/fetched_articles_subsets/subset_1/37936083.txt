BACKGROUND: In recent years, observational studies have been conducted to 
investigate the potential impact of vitamins on sepsis. However, many of these 
studies have produced inconsistent results. Our Mendelian randomization (MR) 
study aims to evaluate the causality between vitamins and sepsis from a genetic 
perspective.
METHODS: Our MR study was designed following the STROBE-MR guidelines. Genetic 
instrumental variables for vitamins including folate, vitamin B12, B6, A 
(Retinol), C, D, and K were obtained from previous genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) and MR studies. Five different sepsis severity levels were 
included in the analysis. The genetic instrumental variables were screened for 
potential confounders using PhenoScanner V2. MR analysis was performed using 
MR-egger, inverse-variance weighted multiplicative random effects (IVW-RE), 
inverse-variance weighted multiplicative fixed-effects (IVW-FE), and wald ratio 
methods to assess the relationship between vitamins and sepsis. Sensitivity 
analysis was performed using the MR-egger_intercept method, and the MR-PRESSO 
package and Cochran's Q test were used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the 
instrumental variables.
RESULTS: Our MR study found no statistically significant association between 
vitamins and sepsis risk, regardless of the type of vitamin (P-value > 0.05). 
The odds ratios (ORs) for folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin A, vitamin D, 
vitamin K, and vitamin C were 1.164 (95% CI: 0.895-1.514), 0.987 (95% CI: 
0.969-1.005), 0.975 (95% CI: 0.914-1.041), 0.993 (95% CI: 0.797-1.238), 0.861 
(95% CI: 0.522-1.42), 0.955 (95% CI: 0.86-1.059), and 1.049 (95% CI: 
0.911-1.208), respectively. Similar results were observed in subgroups of 
different sepsis severity levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our MR study found no evidence of a causal association between 
vitamins and sepsis risk from a genetic perspective. Further randomized 
controlled trials are necessary to confirm these results.
