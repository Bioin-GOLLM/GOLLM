INTRODUCTION: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of clinical and metabolic 
alterations related to the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Metabolic 
changes occurring during puberty, especially in children with overweight and 
obesity, can influence the risk of developing chronic diseases, especially CVD.
METHODS: Longitudinal study based on the follow-up until puberty of a cohort of 
191 prepubertal Spanish boys and girls without congenital, chronic, or 
inflammatory diseases: undernutrition: or intake of any drug that could alter 
blood glucose, blood pressure, or lipid metabolism. The following parameters 
were used to determine the presence of MetS: obesity, hypertension, 
hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL-c.
RESULTS: A total of 75·5% of participants stayed in the same BMI category from 
prepuberty to puberty, whereas 6·3% increased by at least one category. The 
prevalence of MetS was 9·1% (prepubertal stage) and 11·9% (pubertal stage). The 
risk of presenting alterations in puberty for systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
plasma triacylglycerols, HDL cholesterol (HDL-c), and HOMA-IR was significantly 
higher in those participants who had the same alterations in prepuberty. MetS 
prevalence in puberty was predicted by sex and levels of HOMA-IR, BMI-z, and 
waist circumference in the prepubertal stage, in the whole sample: in puberty, 
the predictors were levels of HOMA-IR, BMI-z, and diastolic blood pressure in 
participants with obesity. Two fast-and-frugal decision trees were built to 
predict the risk of MetS in puberty based on prepuberty HOMA-IR (cutoff 2·5), 
SBP (cutoff 106 mm of Hg), and TAG (cutoff 53 mg/dl).
DISCUSSION: Controlling obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors, especially 
HOMA-IR and blood pressure, in children during the prepubertal stage appears 
critical to preventing pubertal MetS effectively.
