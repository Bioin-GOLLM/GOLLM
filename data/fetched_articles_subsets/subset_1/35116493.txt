BACKGROUND: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a serious threat to 
human health and life. The National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene 
Expression Omnibus (NCBI-GEO) database provides valuable information on genes 
related to the pathogenesis and prognosis of ESCC, which helps us to make 
in-depth understanding about the disease and improve its prognosis.
METHODS: Four microarray profiles [GSE77861 (African Americans), GSE26886 
(Germans), GSE17351 (Americans), and GSE45670 (Chinese)] from the NCBI-GEO 
including 49 ESCC tissues and 41 corresponding normal tissues were collected. 
Integrated bioinformatics methods, including protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses, and Kaplan-Meier plotter were applied to 
determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ESCC together with their 
core functions and relationship with survival.
RESULTS: A total of 220 upregulated and 112 downregulated genes were identified 
as DEGs in ESCC, of which, 40 upregulated genes were core function genes. The 
DEGs were mostly involved in DNA replication and cell cycle pathways. Survival 
analysis and Bonferroni adjustment showed kinesin family member 18A (KIF18A) and 
TTK protein kinase (TTK) to be related to prognosis in ESCC.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study verified the previously proposed 
association between TTK and patient survival in ESCC, and identified KIF18A as 
ESCC prognosis-related gene markers for the first time. The underlying mechanism 
needs to be further investigated using larger sample size studies and biological 
experiments in future.
