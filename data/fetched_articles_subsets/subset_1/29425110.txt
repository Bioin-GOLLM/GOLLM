BACKGROUND: IGSF1 abnormality causes diverse symptoms, including congenital 
central hypothyroidism (CCH), prolactin hyposecretion, testicular enlargement 
and delayed puberty.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case of a male patient who visited our 
hospital with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and short stature, in whom we 
identified a novel IGSF1 mutation. He was closely examined because of chronic 
constipation since infancy, persistent abdominal pain at 14 years of age and 
marked short stature (-4.7 standard deviation [SD] for normal Japanese boys). He 
was diagnosed with CCH. Decreased prolactin (PRL) secretion was also observed. 
IGSF1 analysis revealed a novel mutation at the splicing donor site 
(c.2065+1G>A) in intron 11. In silico analysis predicted this mutation to be a 
non-functional splice donor site. After thyroid hormone replacement, his thyroid 
function, constipation and growth rate improved.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a patient in whom constipation and 
short stature led to a diagnosis of CCH with a novel IGSF1 mutation.
