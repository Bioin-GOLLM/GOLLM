High-grade gliomas defined by histone 3 K27M driver mutations exhibit global 
loss of H3K27 trimethylation and reciprocal gain of H3K27 acetylation, 
respectively shaping repressive and active chromatin landscapes. We generated 
tumor-derived isogenic models bearing this mutation and show that it leads to 
pervasive H3K27ac deposition across the genome. In turn, active enhancers and 
promoters are not created de novo and instead reflect the epigenomic landscape 
of the cell of origin. H3K27ac is enriched at repeat elements, resulting in 
their increased expression, which in turn can be further amplified by DNA 
demethylation and histone deacetylase inhibitors providing an exquisite 
therapeutic vulnerability. These agents may therefore modulate anti-tumor immune 
responses as a therapeutic modality for this untreatable disease.
