BACKGROUND: Orf is a contagious disease of sheep, goats and wild ungulates 
caused by orf virus (ORFV) a member of the genus Parapoxvirus, Poxviridae 
family. Although orf is endemic in Ethiopia, little attention has been given so 
far as it is not a notifiable disease by the World Organization for Animal 
Health. In this work, we have investigated orf outbreaks representing five 
different geographical locations of Ethiopia, in Amba Giorgis, Gondar zuria, 
Adet, Debre zeit and Adami Tulu, between 2008 and 2013.
RESULTS: The viral isolation and the sequence analysis of the A32L and the B2L 
genes of eighteen representative isolates confirmed that sampled animals were 
infected by ORFVs. The phylogenetic study and the comparative analysis of the 
deduced amino acid profile suggests that there were two main clusters of ORFV 
isolates which were responsible for the investigated outbreaks. Additionally the 
analysis of these two genes showed limited variability to ORFVs encountered 
elsewhere. This is the first report on the genetic characterization of the ORFV 
isolates from sheep and goats in Ethiopia.
CONCLUSION: The molecular characterization of Ethiopian ORFV isolates 
highlighted the circulation of two main clusters causing orf disease in sheep 
and goats. The use of laboratory based methods and a constant monitoring of 
Ethiopian ORFV isolates is needed to better understand the dynamic of ORFV 
circulating in the country and facilitate the implementation of control 
measures.
