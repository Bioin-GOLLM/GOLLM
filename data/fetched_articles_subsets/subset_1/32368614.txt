Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a particularly difficult cancer to treat due 
to a lack of effective screening or treatment. Pancreatic cancer cells exhibit 
high proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, which is associated 
with poor prognosis. PCNA, an important nuclear DNA replication and repair 
protein, regulates a myriad of proteins via the interdomain connector loop. 
Within this region, amino acids 126-133 are critical for PCNA interactions in 
cancer cells. Here, we investigate the ability of a decoy cell-penetrating 
peptide, R9-caPeptide, that mimics the interdomain connector loop region of PCNA 
to disrupt PCNA-protein interactions in pancreatic cancer cells. Our data 
suggest that R9-caPeptide causes dose-dependent toxicity in a panel of 
pancreatic cancer cell lines by inhibiting DNA replication fork progression and 
PCNA-regulated DNA repair, ultimately causing lethal DNA damage. Overall, these 
studies lay the foundation for novel therapeutic strategies that target PCNA in 
pancreatic cancer.
