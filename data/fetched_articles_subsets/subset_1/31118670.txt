The development of deep-sequencing methods is now unveiling a new landscape of 
previously undetected gene fusion across different tumor types. Chromosomal 
translocation involving the NTRK gene family occur across a wide range of 
cancers in both children and adults. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that 
chimeric proteins encoded by NTRK rearrangements have oncogenic properties and 
drive constitutive expression and ligand-independent activation. Larotrectinib 
(ARRY470, LOXO101, Vitrakvi) is a highly and potent inhibitor of TRKA, TRKB, and 
TRKC, and has demonstrated rema rkable antitumor activity against 
TRK-fusion-positive cancers with a favorable side-effect profile in phase I/II 
clinical trials. In November 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration granted 
accelerated approval to larotrectinib for adult and pediatric patients with 
solid tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions without known acquired resistance 
mutation. In this review, we discuss the clinical activity and safety profile of 
larotrectinib, focusing on the clinical trials that led to its first global 
approval.
