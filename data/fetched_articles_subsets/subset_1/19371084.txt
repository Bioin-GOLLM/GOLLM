The lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP), encoded by the PTPN22 gene, recently 
emerged as an important risk factor and drug target for human autoimmunity. Here 
we solved the structure of the catalytic domain of LYP, which revealed 
noticeable differences with previously published structures. The active center 
with a semi-closed conformation binds a phosphate ion, which may represent an 
intermediate conformation after dephosphorylation of the substrate but before 
release of the phosphate product. The structure also revealed an unusual 
disulfide bond formed between the catalytic Cys and one of the two Cys residues 
nearby, which is not observed in previously determined structures. Our 
structural and mutagenesis data suggest that the disulfide bond may play a role 
in protecting the enzyme from irreversible oxidation. Surprisingly, we found 
that the two noncatalytic Cys around the active center exert an opposite 
yin-yang regulation on the catalytic Cys activity. These detailed structural and 
functional characterizations have provided new insights into autoregulatory 
mechanisms of LYP function.
