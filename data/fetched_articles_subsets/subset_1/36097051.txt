Functional oncogenic links between ErbB2 and ERRα in HER2+ breast cancer 
patients support a therapeutic benefit of co-targeted therapies. However, ErbB2 
and ERRα also play key roles in heart physiology, and this approach could pose a 
potential liability to cardiovascular health. Herein, using integrated 
phosphoproteomic, transcriptomic and metabolic profiling, we uncovered molecular 
mechanisms associated with the adverse remodeling of cardiac functions in mice 
with combined attenuation of ErbB2 and ERRα activity. Genetic disruption of both 
effectors results in profound effects on cardiomyocyte architecture, 
inflammatory response and metabolism, the latter leading to a decrease in fatty 
acyl-carnitine species further increasing the reliance on glucose as a metabolic 
fuel, a hallmark of failing hearts. Furthermore, integrated omics signatures of 
ERRα loss-of-function and doxorubicin treatment exhibit common features of 
chemotherapeutic cardiotoxicity. These findings thus reveal potential 
cardiovascular risks in discrete combination therapies in the treatment of 
breast and other cancers.
