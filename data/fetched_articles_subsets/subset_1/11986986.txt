Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric illness characterised by disturbance of 
thought, hallucination and delusions.(1) Several studies have suggested that 
dysfunctions in the glutamatergic transmission are linked to the pathogenesis of 
schizophrenia, and in particular an excessive activation of glutamate receptors 
seems to be related to the disruption of neuronal ionic gradients leading to 
excitotoxicity.(2-7) Numerous findings suggested that the kainate ionotropic 
glutamate receptors are primarily involved in this mechanism. Recently it has 
been demonstrated that the GRIK3 gene encoding for the ionotropic glutamate 
receptor kainate 3 contains a functional polymorphism (T928G) leading to the 
substitution of a serine with an alanine in position 310 of the protein 
sequence.(8-11) We performed an association study between the ser310ala 
GRIK3polymorphism and schizophrenia in a sample of 99 schizophrenic patients and 
116 controls. We found a significant difference in the genotype distribution and 
in particular considering the ala allele as dominant (P = 0.0105, odds ratio 
(OR) 2.031, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.177-3.504). This finding suggests a 
potential role for GRIK3 for susceptibility to schizophrenia.
