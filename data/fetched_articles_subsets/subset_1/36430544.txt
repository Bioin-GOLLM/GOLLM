The Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1) is one of the six functional 
receptors belonging to the family of monoamine-related G protein-coupled 
receptors (TAAR1-TAAR9) found in humans. However, the exact biological 
mechanisms of TAAR1 central and peripheral action remain to be fully understood. 
TAAR1 is widely expressed in the prefrontal cortex and several limbic regions, 
interplaying with the dopamine system to modulate the reward circuitry. Recent 
clinical trials suggest the efficacy of TAAR1 agonists as potential novel 
antipsychotic agents. Here, we characterize behavioral and neurochemical 
phenotypes of TAAR1 knockout mice, focusing on aggression and self-grooming 
behavior that both strongly depend on the monoaminergic signaling and 
cortico-striatal and cortico-limbic circuits. Overall, we report increased 
aggression in these knockout mice in the resident-intruder test, accompanied by 
reduced self-grooming behavior in the novelty-induced grooming test, and by 
higher cortical serotonin (5-HT) tissue levels. Further studies are necessary to 
explore whether TAAR1-based therapies can become potential novel treatments for 
a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with aggression.
