We have synthesized novel pyrazolo-quinoline analogues (P1-10) in an effort to 
create newer antitubercular drugs against the rising bacterial resistance. NMR, 
IR and ESI-MS spectra were utilized to characterize the synthesised compounds. 
The antitubercular activity of the target compounds was evaluated against 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Six derivatives (P1-6) displayed very significant 
activity at 1.6 µg/mL concentration and were found to be more active than 
pyrazinamide standard. Thus, as per the drug susceptibility results the MIC 
value could be considered between 1.6 and 0.8 µg/mL. In addition, all the 
synthesised compounds were subjected to molecular docking studies against 
specific protein, Enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) in complex with 
N-(4-methylbenzoyl)-4-benzylpiperidine, PDB ID: 2NSD. Among all the compounds 
the most effective compounds were found an Autodock score of 11.6 and 11.2 
against 2NSD, respectively. Further, Zebrafish larvae have been used to test the 
teratogenicity of the synthesised compounds. There were no indications of 
abnormalities with (P2), (P4), (P5), (P6), and (P10) at 0.5 µM.
