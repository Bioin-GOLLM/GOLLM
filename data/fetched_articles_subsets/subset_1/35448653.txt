Semen quality plays a crucial role in the successful implementation of breeding 
programs, especially where artificial insemination (AI) is practiced. Bulls with 
good semen traits have good fertility and can produce a volume of high semen per 
ejaculation. The aim of this review is to use an information approach to 
highlight candidate genes and their relation to bull semen production traits. 
The use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been demonstrated to be 
successful in identifying genomic regions and individual variations associated 
with production traits. Studies have reported over 40 genes associated with 
semen traits using Illumina BeadChip single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs).
