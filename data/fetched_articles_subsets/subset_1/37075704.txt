Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common chronic liver disease 
globally and a leading cause for liver transplantation in the US. Its 
pathogenesis remains imprecisely defined. We combined two high-resolution 
modalities to tissue samples from NASH clinical trials, machine learning 
(ML)-based quantification of histological features and transcriptomics, to 
identify genes that are associated with disease progression and clinical events. 
A histopathology-driven 5-gene expression signature predicted disease 
progression and clinical events in patients with NASH with F3 (pre-cirrhotic) 
and F4 (cirrhotic) fibrosis. Notably, the Notch signaling pathway and genes 
implicated in liver-related diseases were enriched in this expression signature. 
In a validation cohort where pharmacologic intervention improved disease 
histology, multiple Notch signaling components were suppressed.
