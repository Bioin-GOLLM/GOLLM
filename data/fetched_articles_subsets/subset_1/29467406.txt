In crops, nitrogen directly determines productivity and biomass. However, the 
improvement of nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) is still a major challenge 
in modern agriculture. Here, we report the characterization of are1, a genetic 
suppressor of a rice fd-gogat mutant defective in nitrogen assimilation. ARE1 is 
a highly conserved gene, encoding a chloroplast-localized protein. 
Loss-of-function mutations in ARE1 cause delayed senescence and result in 10-20% 
grain yield increases, hence enhance NUE under nitrogen-limiting conditions. 
Analysis of a panel of 2155 rice varieties reveals that 18% indica and 48% aus 
accessions carry small insertions in the ARE1 promoter, which result in a 
reduction in ARE1 expression and an increase in grain yield under 
nitrogen-limiting conditions. We propose that ARE1 is a key mediator of NUE and 
represents a promising target for breeding high-yield cultivars under 
nitrogen-limiting condition.
