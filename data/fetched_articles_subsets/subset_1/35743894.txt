Intramedullary spinal cord metastases (ISCM) are uncommon metastases of the 
spinal cord. Magnetic resonance (MR) plays an important role in surgical 
planning when ISCM is suspected in the differential diagnosis. The incidence of 
ISCM is expected to increase due to the longer survival of cancer patients as 
well as the widespread use of MR in the diagnosis of neurological syndromes. The 
management of these patients is controversial because of the multiple clinical 
presentations and lack of controlled studies on the efficacy of different 
therapeutic approaches. Increased awareness of this rare entity may lead to an 
earlier diagnosis with novel imaging approaches at a stage when neurological 
deficits are reversible. A case of ISCM in a 49-year-old patient with 
differentiated thyroid cancer is reported.
