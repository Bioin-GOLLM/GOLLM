Yin Yang 2 encodes a mammalian-specific transcription factor (YY2) that shares 
high homology in the zinc finger region with both YY1 and REX1/ZFP42, encoded by 
the Yin Yang 1 and Reduced Expression Protein 1/Zinc Finger Protein 42 gene, 
respectively. In contrast to the well-established roles of the latter two in 
gene regulation, X chromosome inactivation and binding to specific transposable 
elements (TEs), much less is known about YY2, and its presence during mouse 
preimplantation development has not been described. As it has been reported that 
mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) cannot be propagated in the absence of Yy2, 
the mechanistic understanding of how Yy2 contributes to mESC maintenance remains 
only very partially characterized. We describe Yy2 expression studies using 
RT-PCR and staining with a high-affinity polyclonal serum in mouse embryos and 
mESC. Although YY2 is expressed during preimplantation development, its presence 
appears dispensable for developmental progress in vitro until formation of the 
blastocyst. Attenuation of Yy2 levels failed to alter either Zscan4 levels in 
two-cell embryos or IAP and MERVL levels at later preimplantation stages. In 
contrast to previous claims that constitutively expressed shRNA against Yy2 in 
mESC prohibited the propagation of mESC in culture, we obtained colonies 
generated from mESC with attenuated Yy2 levels. Concomitant with a decreased 
number of undifferentiated colonies, Yy2-depleted mESC expressed higher levels 
of Zscan4 but no differences in the expression of TEs or other pluripotency 
markers including Sox2, Oct4, Nanog and Esrrb were observed. These results 
confirm the contribution of Yy2 to the maintenance of mouse embryonic stem cells 
and show the preimplantation expression of YY2. These functions are discussed in 
relation to mammalian-specific functions of YY1 and REX1.
