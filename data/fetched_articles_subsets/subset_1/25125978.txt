Hydroxyapatite (HA) is considered to be a bioactive material that favorably 
influences the adhesion, growth, and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts. 
To optimize the cell response on the hydroxyapatite composite, it is desirable 
to assess the optimum concentration and also the optimum particle size. The aim 
of our study was to prepare composite materials made of polydimethylsiloxane, 
polyamide, and nano-sized (N) or micro-sized (M) HA, with an HA content of 0%, 
2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% (v/v) (referred to as N0-N25 or M0-M25), and to 
evaluate them in vitro in cultures with human osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. For 
clinical applications, fast osseointegration of the implant into the bone is 
essential. We observed the greatest initial cell adhesion on composites M10 and 
N5. Nano-sized HA supported cell growth, especially during the first 3 days of 
culture. On composites with micro-size HA (2%-15%), MG-63 cells reached the 
highest densities on day 7. Samples M20 and M25, however, were toxic for MG-63 
cells, although these composites supported the production of osteocalcin in 
these cells. On N2, a higher concentration of osteopontin was found in MG-63 
cells. For biomedical applications, the concentration range of 5%-15% (v/v) 
nano-size or micro-size HA seems to be optimum.
