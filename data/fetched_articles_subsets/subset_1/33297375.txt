Neurodegenerative disorders are a family of incurable conditions. Among them, 
Alzheimer's disease and tauopathies are the most common. Pathological features 
of these two disorders are synaptic loss, neuronal cell death and increased DNA 
damage. A key pathological protein for the onset and progression of the 
conditions is the protein tau, a microtubule-binding protein highly expressed in 
neurons and encoded by the MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) gene. Tau 
is predominantly a cytosolic protein that interacts with numerous other proteins 
and molecules. Recent findings, however, have highlighted new and unexpected 
roles for tau in the nucleus of neuronal cells. This review summarizes the 
functions of tau in the metabolism of DNA, describing them in the context of the 
disorders.
