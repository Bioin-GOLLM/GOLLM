Mitochondria generate ATP and play regulatory roles in various cellular 
activities. Cancer cells often exhibit fragmented mitochondria. However, the 
underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we report that a mitochondrial 
protein FUN14 domain containing 2 (FUNDC2) is transcriptionally upregulated in 
primary mouse liver tumors, and in approximately 40% of human hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). Importantly, elevated FUNDC2 expression inversely correlates 
with patient survival, and its knockdown inhibits liver tumorigenesis in mice. 
Mechanistically, the amino-terminal region of FUNDC2 interacts with the GTPase 
domain of mitofusin 1 (MFN1), thus inhibits its activity in promoting fusion of 
outer mitochondrial membrane. As a result, loss of FUNDC2 leads to mitochondrial 
elongation, decreased mitochondrial respiration, and reprogrammed cellular 
metabolism. These results identified a mechanism of mitochondrial fragmentation 
in cancer through MFN1 inhibition by FUNDC2, and suggested FUNDC2 as a potential 
therapeutic target of HCC.
