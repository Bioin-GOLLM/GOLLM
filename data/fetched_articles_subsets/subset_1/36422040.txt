Aspergillus fumigatus is a widespread airborne fungal pathogen in humans. 
However, the functional genes in A. fumigatus that may contribute to its 
pathogenesis have not yet been fully identified. Vacuolar H+-ATPase is universal 
in eukaryotic organisms but exhibits specific roles in various species. Here, we 
identified VmaC as a putative subunit of vacuolar H+-ATPase in A. fumigatus that 
is widely conserved through evolution. The C-terminal hydrophobic domain of VmaC 
plays a critical role in its vacuolar localization and growth and conidiation. 
Deletion or turn-off of VmaC encoding gene-AfvmaC expression is not lethal but 
leads to a very sick and tiny colony phenotype, which is different from that of 
yeast with conditional ScvmaC defects. Furthermore, we found that AfvmaC not 
only participates in maintaining calcium homeostasis and vacuolar acidity but is 
also involved in cell wall integration pathway regulation, highlighting the 
importance of the vacuole as a storage organelle associated with many aspects of 
cellular homeostasis. This study indicates that fungal VmaC is relatively 
conserved. When compared to that in model yeasts, VmaC in A. fumigatus is 
required for hyphal growth and conidiation, suggesting that specific motifs in 
VmaC might be functioned in Aspergilli.
