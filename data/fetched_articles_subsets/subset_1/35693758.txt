Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease with a background of polygenic 
inheritance. Both environmental and genetic factors are involved in the etiology 
of the disease. In the last two decades, numerous studies have been conducted 
through linkage analysis, genome-wide association study (GWAS), and direct 
sequencing to explore the role of genetic variation in disease pathogenesis and 
progression. To date, >80 psoriasis susceptibility genes have been identified, 
including HLA-Cw6, IL12B, IL23R, and LCE3B/3C. Some genetic markers have been 
applied in disease prediction, clinical diagnosis, treatment, and new drug 
development, which could further explain the pathogenesis of psoriasis and 
promote the development of precision medicine. This review summarizes related 
research on genetic variation in psoriasis and explores implications of the 
findings in clinical application and the promotion of a personalized medicine 
project.
