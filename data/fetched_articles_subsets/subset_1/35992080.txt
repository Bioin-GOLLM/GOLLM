Woolly mammoths had a set of adaptations that enabled them to thrive in the 
Arctic environment. Many mammoth-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
responsible for unique mammoth traits have been previously identified from 
ancient genomes. However, a multitude of other genetic variants likely 
contributed to woolly mammoth evolution. In this study, we sequenced two woolly 
mammoth genomes and combined these with previously sequenced mammoth and 
elephant genomes to conduct a survey of mammoth-specific deletions and indels. 
We find that deletions are highly enriched in non-coding regions, suggesting 
selection against structural variants that affect protein sequences. 
Nonetheless, at least 87 woolly mammoth genes contain deletions or indels that 
modify the coding sequence, including genes involved in skeletal morphology and 
hair growth. These results suggest that deletions and indels contributed to the 
unique phenotypic adaptations of the woolly mammoth, and were potentially 
critical to surviving in its natural environment.
