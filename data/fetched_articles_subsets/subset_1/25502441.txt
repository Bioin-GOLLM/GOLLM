A small multigene family encodes 4-coumarate:CoA ligases (4CLs) catalyzing the 
CoA ligation of hydroxycinnamic acids, a branch point step directing metabolites 
to a flavonoid or monolignol pathway. In the present study, we examined the 
effect of antisense Populus tremuloides 4CL (Pt4CL1) to the lignin and soluble 
phenolic compound composition of silver birch (Betula pendula) Pt4CL1a lines in 
comparison with non-transgenic silver birch clones. The endogenous expression of 
silver birch 4CL genes was recorded in the stems and leaves and also in leaves 
that were mechanically injured. In one of the transgenic Pt4CL1a lines, the 
ratio of syringyl (S) and guaiacyl (G) lignin units was increased. Moreover, the 
transcript levels of putative silver birch 4CL gene (Bp4CL1) were reduced and 
contents of cinnamic acid derivatives altered. In the other two Pt4CL1a lines 
changes were detected in the level of individual phenolic compounds. However, 
considerable variation was found in the transcript levels of silver birch 4CLs 
as well as in the concentration of phenolic compounds among the transgenic lines 
and non-transgenic clones. Wounding induced the expression of Bp4CL1 and Bp4CL2 
in leaves in all clones and transgenic lines, whereas the transcript levels of 
Bp4CL3 and Bp4CL4 remained unchanged. Moreover, minor changes were detected in 
the concentrations of phenolic compounds caused by wounding. As an overall trend 
the wounding decreased the flavonoid content in silver birches and increased the 
content of soluble condensed tannins. The results indicate that by reducing the 
Bp4CL1 transcript levels lignin composition could be modified. However, the 
alterations found among the Pt4CL1a lines and the non-transgenic clones were 
within the natural variation of silver birches, as shown in the present study by 
the clonal differences in the transcripts levels of 4CL genes, soluble phenolic 
compounds and condensed tannins.
