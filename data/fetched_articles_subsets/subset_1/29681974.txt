The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of baicalin on 
controlling the pulmonary infection and improving the prognosis in influenza A 
virus (IAV) infection. PCR and western blot were used to measure the changes of 
some key factors in RLRs signaling pathway. MSD electrochemiluminescence was 
used to measure the expression of pulmonary inflammatory cytokines including 
IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, and KC/GRO. Flow 
cytometry was used to detect the proportion of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg. The 
results showed that IAV infection led to low body weight and high viral load and 
high expression of RIG-I, IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB mRNA, as well as RIG-I and NF-κB 
p65 protein. However, baicalin reduced the rate of body weight loss, inhibited 
virus replication, and downregulated the key factors of the RLRs signaling 
pathway. Besides, baicalin reduced the high expression inflammatory cytokines in 
lung and decreased the ratios of Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg to arouse a brief but not 
overviolent inflammatory response. Therefore, baicalin activated a balanced host 
inflammatory response to limit immunopathologic injury, which was helpful to the 
improvement of clinical and survival outcomes.
