Mounting evidence indicates that vitamin C has the potential to be a potent 
anti-cancer agent when administered intravenously and in high doses (high-dose 
IVC). Early phase clinical trials have confirmed safety and indicated efficacy 
of IVC in eradicating tumour cells of various cancer types. In recent years, the 
multi-targeting effects of vitamin C were unravelled, demonstrating a role as 
cancer-specific, pro-oxidative cytotoxic agent, anti-cancer epigenetic regulator 
and immune modulator, reversing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inhibiting 
hypoxia and oncogenic kinase signalling and boosting immune response. Moreover, 
high-dose IVC is powerful as an adjuvant treatment for cancer, acting 
synergistically with many standard (chemo-) therapies, as well as a method for 
mitigating the toxic side-effects of chemotherapy. Despite the rationale and 
ample evidence, strong clinical data and phase III studies are lacking. 
Therefore, there is a need for more extensive awareness of the use of this 
highly promising, non-toxic cancer treatment in the clinical setting. In this 
review, we provide an elaborate overview of pre-clinical and clinical studies 
using high-dose IVC as anti-cancer agent, as well as a detailed evaluation of 
the main known molecular mechanisms involved. A special focus is put on global 
molecular profiling studies in this respect. In addition, an outlook on future 
implications of high-dose vitamin C in cancer treatment is presented and 
recommendations for further research are discussed.
