The overexpression of the A3 adenosine receptor (AR) in a number of cancer cell 
types makes it an attractive target for tumor diagnosis and therapy. Hence, in 
the search for new A3AR ligands, a series of novel 2,N6-disubstituted adenosines 
(Ados) was synthesized and tested in radioligand binding and functional assays 
at ARs. Derivatives bearing a 2-phenethylamino group in the N6-position were 
found to exert higher A3AR affinity and selectivity than the corresponding 
N6-(2,2-diphenylethyl) analogues. 2-Chloro-N6-phenylethylAdo (15) was found to 
be a potent full A3AR agonist with a Ki of 0.024 nM and an EC50 of 14 nM, in a 
cAMP accumulation assay. Unlike 15, the other ligands behaved as A3AR 
antagonists, which concentration-dependently reduced cell growth and exerted 
cytostatic activity on the prostate cancer cell line PC3, showing comparable and 
even more pronounced effects with respect to the ones elicited by the reference 
full agonist Cl-IB-MECA. In particular, the 
N6-(2,2-diphenylethyl)-2-phenylethynylAdo (12: GI50 = 14 µM, TGI = 29 µM, and 
LC50 = 59 µM) showed the highest activity proving to be a potential antitumor 
agent. The cytostatic effect of both A3AR agonist (Cl-IB-MECA) and antagonists 
(12 and other newly synthesized compounds) confirm previous observations 
according to which, in addition to the involvement of A3ARs, other cellular 
mechanisms are responsible for the anticancer effects of these ligands.
