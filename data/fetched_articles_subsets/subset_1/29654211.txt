The transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is an attractive target for Ab-mediated cancer 
therapy. We previously developed a mouse/human chimeric IgG3 Ab (ch128.1) 
targeting human TfR1, which exhibits direct in vitro cytotoxicity against 
certain human malignant B cells through TfR1 degradation and iron deprivation. 
ch128.1 also demonstrates exceptional antitumor activity against the B cell 
malignancy multiple myeloma (MM) in xenograft models of SCID-Beige mice bearing 
either disseminated ARH-77 or KMS-11 cells in an early disease setting. 
Interestingly, this activity is observed even against KMS-11 cells, which show 
no sensitivity to the direct cytotoxic activity of ch128.1 in vitro. To 
understand the contributions of the Fc fragment, we generated a ch128.1 mutant 
with impaired binding to FcγRs and to the complement component C1q, which 
retains binding to the neonatal Fc receptor. We now report that this mutant Ab 
does not show antitumor activity in these two MM models, indicating a crucial 
role of the Fc fragment in the antitumor activity of ch128.1, which can be 
attributed to effector functions (Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, 
Ab-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis, and/or complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity). Interestingly, in the KMS-11 model, complement depletion does not 
affect protection, whereas macrophage depletion does. Consistent with this 
observation, we found that ch128.1 induces Ab-dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity and Ab-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis against KMS-11 cells in 
the presence of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Finally, we found that 
ch128.1 therapy effectively increases survival in a late MM disease setting. Our 
results suggest that macrophages play a major role in ch128.1-mediated antitumor 
protection in our models and that ch128.1 can be effective against human B cell 
malignancies such as MM.
