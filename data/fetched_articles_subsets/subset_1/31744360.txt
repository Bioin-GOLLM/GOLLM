BACKGROUND: Prematurity is the main cause of perinatal and neonatal morbidity 
and mortality worldwide. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been 
associated with the pathogenesis of morbidities in preterm neonates. We aimed to 
investigate the association between SNPs in regulatory genes of innate immune 
response IL1B, IL6, IL6R, IL10, TNFA, TNFRII, TLR2 and TLR4 and neonatal/infant 
morbidities in preterm newborns.
METHODS: Oral swabs were collected from 272 newborns (91 preterm and 181 at 
term) seen at Botucatu Medical School, Unesp, between 2013 and 2014 and SNPs 
were identified using Taqman速 Genotyping Assays. Medical records were examined 
to obtain data regarding neonatal/infant morbidity. Stepwise binomial logistic 
regression models were used to explain the morbidities.
RESULTS: Minor neonatal morbidity was influenced by the clinical parameters of 
maternal age and newborn weight at birth and by the presence of the allele IL6R2 
C (rs2228145) while major neonatal morbidity was only influenced by gestational 
age. Minor infant morbidity was associated with the allele TLR2 T (rs4696480) 
and major infant morbidity was associated with gestational age and presence of 
IL6R2 C.
CONCLUSION: The presence of SNPs that exacerbate the inflammatory response 
increases the susceptibility to neonatal and infant morbidity.
