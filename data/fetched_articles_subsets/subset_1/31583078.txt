Complex mechanisms control the signaling of neurotrophins through p75 NTR and 
Trk receptors, allowing cellular responses that are highly context dependent, 
particularly in the nervous system and particularly with regard to the 
neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Recent reports describe a 
variety of sophisticated regulatory mechanisms that contribute to such 
functional flexibility. Mechanisms described include regulation of trafficking 
of alternative BDNF transcripts, regulation of post-translational processing and 
secretion of BDNF, engagement of co-receptors that influence localization and 
signaling of p75 NTR and Trk receptors, and control of trafficking of receptors 
in the endocytic pathway and during anterograde and retrograde axonal transport.
