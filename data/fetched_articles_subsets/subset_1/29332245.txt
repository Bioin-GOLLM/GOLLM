Metabolomics studies in the context of ophthalmology have largely focused on 
identifying metabolite concentrations that characterize specific retinal 
diseases. Studies involving mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have shown that individuals suffering from retinal 
diseases exhibit metabolic profiles that markedly differ from those of control 
individuals, supporting the notion that metabolites may serve as easily 
identifiable biomarkers for specific conditions. An emerging branch of 
metabolomics resulting from biomarker studies, however, involves the study of 
retinal metabolic dysfunction as causes of degeneration. Recent publications 
have identified a number of metabolic processes-including but not limited to 
glucose and oxygen metabolism-that, when perturbed, play a role in the 
degeneration of photoreceptor cells. As a result, such studies have led to 
further research elucidating methods for prolonging photoreceptor survival in an 
effort to halt degeneration in its early stages. This review will explore the 
ways in which metabolomics has deepened our understanding of the causes of 
retinal degeneration and discuss how metabolomics can be used to prevent retinal 
degeneration from progressing to its later disease stages.
