Autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) constitutes a primary 
immunodeficiency syndrome associated with increased apoptosis in myeloid cells, 
yet the underlying genetic defect remains unknown. Using a positional cloning 
approach and candidate gene evaluation, we identified a recurrent homozygous 
germline mutation in HAX1 in three pedigrees. After further molecular screening 
of individuals with SCN, we identified 19 additional affected individuals with 
homozygous HAX1 mutations, including three belonging to the original pedigree 
described by Kostmann. HAX1 encodes the mitochondrial protein HAX1, which has 
been assigned functions in signal transduction and cytoskeletal control. Here, 
we show that HAX1 is critical for maintaining the inner mitochondrial membrane 
potential and protecting against apoptosis in myeloid cells. Our findings 
suggest that HAX1 is a major regulator of myeloid homeostasis and underline the 
significance of genetic control of apoptosis in neutrophil development.
