The RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 trigger innate immune 
responses against viral infections that serve to limit virus replication and to 
stimulate adaptive immunity. RLRs are cytosolic sensors for virus-derived RNA 
and thus responsible for intracellular immune surveillance against infection. 
RLR signaling requires the adapter protein MAVS to induce type I interferon, 
interferon-stimulated genes, and proinflammatory cytokines. This review focuses 
on the molecular and cell biological requirements for RLR signal transduction.
