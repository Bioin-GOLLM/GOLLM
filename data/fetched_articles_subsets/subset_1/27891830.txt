OBJECTIVE: Genetic testing for obesity is available directly to consumers, yet 
little is understood about its behavioral impact and its added value to 
nongenetic risk communication efforts based on lifestyle factors.
METHODS: A randomized trial examined the short-term impact of providing 
personalized obesity risk information, using a 2 × 2 factorial design. 
Participants were recruited from the Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative 
(CPMC) and randomized to receive (1) no risk information (control), (2) genetic 
risk, (3) lifestyle risk, or (4) combined genetic/lifestyle risks. Baseline and 
3-month follow-up survey data were collected. Analyses examined the impact of 
risk feedback on intentions to lose weight and self-reported weight.
RESULTS: A total of 696 participants completed the study. A significant 
interaction effect was observed for genetic and lifestyle information on intent 
to lose weight (P = 0.0150). Those who received genetic risk alone had greater 
intentions at follow-up, compared with controls (P = 0.0034). The impact of 
receiving elevated risk information on intentions varied by source and 
combination of risks presented. Non-elevated genetic risk did not lower 
intentions. No group differences were observed for self-reported weight.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic risk information for obesity may add value to lifestyle 
risk information depending on the context in which it is presented.
