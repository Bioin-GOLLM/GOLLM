Hereditary artifacts in BRCA1 gene have a significant contributory role in 
familial cases of breast cancer. However, its germline mutational penetrance in 
sporadic breast cancer cases with respect to Pakistani population has not yet 
been very well defined. This study was designed to assess the contributory role 
of germline mutations of this gene in sporadic cases of breast cancer. 150 cases 
of unilateral breast cancer patients, with no prior family history of breast 
cancer and no other disorders or diseases in general with age range 35-75 yrs, 
were included in this study.Mutational analysis for hot spots on Exon 2, 3 and 
13 of BRCA1 was done by using Single Strand Conformational Polymorphism (SSCP). 
Sequence analysis revealed five variants (missense) and one novel splice site 
mutation at exon 13. No germline mutation was observed on the remaining exons 
with respect sporadic breast cancer cases in Pakistani population. A vast 
majority of breast cancer cases are sporadic; the present study may be helpful 
for designing a better genetic screening tool for germline BRCA mutations in 
sporadic breast cancer patients of Pakistani population. Further studies 
involving a screening of entire coding region of BRCA1 is required to explore 
the merits of genetic diagnosis and counseling in breast cancer patients.
