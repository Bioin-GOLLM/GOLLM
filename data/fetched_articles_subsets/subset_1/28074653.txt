Curcumin is a constituent (up to âˆ¼5%) of the traditional medicine known as 
turmeric. Interest in the therapeutic use of turmeric and the relative ease of 
isolation of curcuminoids has led to their extensive investigation. Curcumin has 
recently been classified as both a PAINS (pan-assay interference compounds) and 
an IMPS (invalid metabolic panaceas) candidate. The likely false activity of 
curcumin in vitro and in vivo has resulted in >120 clinical trials of 
curcuminoids against several diseases. No double-blinded, placebo controlled 
clinical trial of curcumin has been successful. This manuscript reviews the 
essential medicinal chemistry of curcumin and provides evidence that curcumin is 
an unstable, reactive, nonbioavailable compound and, therefore, a highly 
improbable lead. On the basis of this in-depth evaluation, potential new 
directions for research on curcuminoids are discussed.
