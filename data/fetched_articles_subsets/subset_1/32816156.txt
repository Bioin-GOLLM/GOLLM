We previously reported a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 1G8, against the 
neuraminidase (NA) of H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) with significant NA 
inhibitory activity. To generate a recombinant chickenized mAb (RCmAb) against 
the NA of H9N2 AIV for passive immunization in poultry, the gene of the fragment 
of antigen binding (Fab) of mAb 1G8 was cloned and fused with the fragment 
crystallizable (Fc) gene of chicken IgY. The RCmAb 1G8 was expressed in COS-1 
cells and could be detected in cell culture supernatant. The results of NA 
inhibitory activity tests of the RCmAb 1G8 in an enzyme-linked lectin assay 
(ELLA) and a microneutralization (MN) assay showed that the RCmAb 1G8 maintained 
significant NA inhibitory activity and neutralizing ability. This is the first 
chickenized antibody against AIV, which would be a good candidate for passive 
immunization in poultry.
