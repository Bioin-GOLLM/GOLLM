Actin networks drive many essential cellular processes, including cell 
migration, cytokinesis and tissue morphogenesis. However, how cells organize and 
regulate dynamic actin networks that consist of long, unbranched actin filaments 
is only poorly understood. This study in mouse oocytes reveals that cells can 
use vesicles as adaptable, motorized network nodes to regulate the dynamics and 
density of intracellular actin networks. In particular, Rab11a-positive vesicles 
drive the network dynamics in a myosin-Vb-dependent manner, and modulate the 
network density by sequestering and clustering the network's actin nucleators. 
We also report a simple way by which networks of different densities can be 
generated, namely by adjusting the number and volume of vesicles in the cell. 
This vesicle-based mechanism of actin network modulation is essential for 
asymmetric positioning of the meiotic spindle in mouse oocytes, a vital step in 
the development of a fertilizable egg in mammals.
