The evolution to blast phase is a frequently unpredictable and almost invariably 
fatal event in the course of myeloproliferative neoplasms. The molecular 
mechanisms underlying blast transformation have not been elucidated and the 
specific genetic and epigenetic events governing leukemogenesis remain unclear. 
The result of the long-lasting dynamics, passing through progressive genetic 
steps, is the emergence of one or more clones often characterized by complex 
genetics, either at conventional karyotyping or at modern high-throughput 
sequencing analyses, with all clinical and prognostic correlates. The current 
therapeutic approaches are largely inadequate and incapable of modifying the 
inherent unfavorable outcome. In this perspective, the application of targeted 
strategies should aim to prevent the occurrence of leukemic evolution. At 
transformation, the crucial target of treatment should be the allocation to 
allogeneic transplant for eligible patients. With this in mind, novel 
combination treatments may provide useful bridging strategies, beyond 
potentially improving outcomes for patients who are not candidates for intensive 
approaches.
