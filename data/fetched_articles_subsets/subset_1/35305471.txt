Thoracic aortic dissection is a devastating cardiovascular disease with an 
increasing annual incidence. The homozygous mutation in rs1801133 site has been 
accepted for decreased enzyme activity of mutant MTHFR protein, contributing to 
an accumulated homocysteine in blood. Recently, elevated homocysteine level is 
causally associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Conversely, the relationship between rs1801133 and thoracic aortic dissection is 
poorly understood. Here, the generated human induced pluripotent stem cell 
(iPSC) line provided a novel strategy for investigating the underlying mechanism 
of MTHFR mutation (rs1801133, TT) and its implication in the pathogenesis of 
thoracic aortic dissection.
