Mucins represent major components of the mucous layer in the stomach, protecting 
the underlying epithelium from acid, mechanical trauma, proteases and pathogenic 
bacteria. Previous studies have shown an association of neoplastic 
transformation in the stomach with aberrant mucin levels, suggesting a potential 
role of genetic variation in mucin genes in the development of gastric cancer 
(GC). We assessed the association of genetic variation in candidate single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mucin genes with the risk of chronic atrophic 
gastritis (CAG), a well-established precursor of GC in the German 
population-based ESTHER study. We genotyped MUC1 T31T, MUC2 L58P, MUC2 V116M, 
MUC5B E34G, MUC5B R51W, MUC5B rs2014486 (intronic) and MUC6 V619M for 533 
serologically defined CAG cases and 1054 age- and sex-matched controls. None of 
the analysed SNPs was associated with CAG. However, large studies are needed to 
disclose or exclude potential weak associations of these SNPs with CAG risk.
