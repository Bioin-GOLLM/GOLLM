Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) has been shown to be crucial 
for tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, and thus MT1-MMP is a high 
priority target for potential cancer therapies. To properly evaluate MT1-MMP 
inhibitors, a screening protocol is desired by which enzyme activity can be 
quantified in a tumor microenvironment-like model system. In the present study, 
we applied a fluorogenic, collagen model triple-helical substrate to quantify 
MT1-MMP activity for tumor spheroids embedded in a collagen hydrogel. The 
substrate was designed to be MT1-MMP selective and to possess fluorescent 
properties compatible with cell-based assays. The proteolysis of the substrate 
correlated to glioma spheroid invasion. In turn, the application of either small 
molecule or protein-based MMP inhibitors reduced proteolytic activity and glioma 
spheroid invasion. The presence of MT1-MMP in glioma spheroids was confirmed by 
western blotting. Thus, spheroid invasion was dependent on MT1-MMP activity, and 
inhibitors of MT1-MMP and invasion could be conveniently screened in a 
high-throughput format. The combination of the fluorogenic, triple-helical 
substrate, the three-dimensional tumor spheroids embedded in collagen, and 
Hit-Pick software resulted in an easily adaptable in vivo-like tumor 
microenvironment for rapidly processing inhibitor potential for anti-cancer use.
