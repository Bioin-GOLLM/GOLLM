BACKGROUND: Protein kinases are a large family of druggable proteins that are 
genomically and proteomically altered in many human cancers. Kinase-targeted 
drugs are emerging as promising avenues for personalized medicine because of the 
differential response shown by altered kinases to drug treatment in patients and 
cell-based assays. However, an incomplete understanding of the relationships 
connecting genome, proteome and drug sensitivity profiles present a major 
bottleneck in targeting kinases for personalized medicine.
RESULTS: In this study, we propose a multi-component Quantitative 
Structure-Mutation-Activity Relationship Tests (QSMART) model and neural 
networks framework for providing explainable models of protein kinase inhibition 
and drug response ([Formula: see text]) profiles in cell lines. Using non-small 
cell lung cancer as a case study, we show that interaction terms that capture 
associations between drugs, pathways, and mutant kinases quantitatively 
contribute to the response of two EGFR inhibitors (afatinib and lapatinib). In 
particular, protein-protein interactions associated with the JNK apoptotic 
pathway, associations between lung development and axon extension, and 
interaction terms connecting drug substructures and the volume/charge of mutant 
residues at specific structural locations contribute significantly to the 
observed [Formula: see text] values in cell-based assays.
CONCLUSIONS: By integrating multi-omics data in the QSMART model, we not only 
predict drug responses in cancer cell lines with high accuracy but also identify 
features and explainable interaction terms contributing to the accuracy. 
Although we have tested our multi-component explainable framework on protein 
kinase inhibitors, it can be extended across the proteome to investigate the 
complex relationships connecting genotypes and drug sensitivity profiles.
