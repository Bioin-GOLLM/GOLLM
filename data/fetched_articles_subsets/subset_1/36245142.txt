Variable Regions of p53 Isoforms Allosterically Hard Code DNA Interaction.

Allosteric regulation of protein activity pervades biology as the "second secret 
of life." We have been examining the allosteric regulation and mutant 
reactivation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. We have found that 
generalizing the definition of allosteric effector to include entire proteins 
and expanding the meaning of binding site to include the interface of a 
transcription factor with its DNA to be useful in understanding the modulation 
of protein activity. Here, we cast the variable regions of p53 isoforms as 
allosteric regulators of p53 interactions with its consensus DNA. We implemented 
molecular dynamics simulations and our lab's new techniques of molecular 
dynamics (MD) sectors and MD-Markov state models to investigate the effects of 
nine naturally occurring splice variant isoforms of p53. We find that all of the 
isoforms differ from wild type in their dynamic properties and how they interact 
with the DNA. We consider the implications of these findings on allostery and 
cancer treatment.
