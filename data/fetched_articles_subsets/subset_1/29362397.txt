Glutathione transferase classical GSH conjugation activity plays a critical role 
in cellular detoxification against xenobiotics and noxious compounds as well as 
against oxidative stress. However, this feature is also exploited by cancer 
cells to acquire drug resistance and improve their survival. As a result, 
various members of the family were found overexpressed in a number of different 
cancers. Moreover several GST polymorphisms, ranging from null phenotypes to 
point mutations, were detected in members of the family and found to correlate 
with the onset of neuro-degenerative diseases. In the last decades, a great deal 
of research aimed at clarifying the role played by GSTs in drug resistance, at 
developing inhibitors to counteract this activity but also at exploiting GSTs 
for prodrugs specific activation in cancer cells. Here we summarize some of the 
most important achievements reached in this lively area of research.
