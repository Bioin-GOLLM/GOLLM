Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a pandemic for more than a year. 
With the expanding second wave of the pandemic in winter, the continuous 
evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has brought new issues, including the significance of 
virus mutations in infection and the detection of asymptomatic infection. In 
this review, we first introduced several major SARS-CoV-2 mutations since the 
COVID-19 outbreak and then mentioned the widely used molecular detection 
techniques to diagnose COVID-19, primarily focusing on their strengths and 
limitations. We further discussed the effects of viral genetic variation and 
asymptomatic infection on the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The 
review finally summarized useful insights into the molecular diagnosis of 
COVID-19 under the special situation being challenged by virus mutation and 
asymptomatic infection.
