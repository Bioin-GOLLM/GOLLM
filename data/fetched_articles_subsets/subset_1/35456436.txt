BACKGROUND: The detection of CEBPA and FLT3 mutations by next generation 
sequencing (NGS) is challenging due to high GC content and Internal Tandem 
Duplications (ITDs). Recent advances have been made to surmount these 
challenges. In this study, we compare three commercial kits and evaluate the 
performance of these more advanced hybrid-capture and AMP-chemistry based 
methods.
METHODS: Amplicon-based TSM 54-Gene Panel (Illumina) was evaluated against 
hybridization-capture SOPHiA Genetics MSP, OGT SureSeq, and AMP chemistry-based 
VariantPlex (Archer) for wet-lab workflow and data-analysis pipelines. Standard 
kit directions and commercial analysis pipelines were followed. Seven CEBPA and 
10 FLT3-positive cases were identified that previously were missed on an 
amplicon NGS assay. The average reads, coverage uniformity, and the detection of 
CEBPA or FLT3 mutations were compared.
RESULTS: All three panels detected all 10 CEBPA mutations and all 10 FLT3 ITDs 
with 100% sensitivity. In addition, there was high concordance (100%) between 
all three panels detecting 47/47 confirmed variants in a set of core myeloid 
genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the NGS assays are now able to reliably 
detect CEBPA mutations and FLT3 ITDs. These assays may allow foregoing 
additional orthogonal testing for CEBPA and FLT3.
