BACKGROUND: Many biologic functions depend on sufficient iron levels, and iron 
deficiency is especially common among blood donors. Genetic variants associated 
with iron levels have been identified, but the impact of genetic variation on 
iron levels among blood donors remains unclear.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of six single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) on ferritin levels in 14,126 blood donors were investigated in four 
genes: in Human Hemochromatosis Protein gene (HFE; rs1800562 and rs179945); in 
Transmembrane Protease gene, Serine 6 (TMPRSS6-regulating hepcidin; rs855791); 
in BTB domain containing protein gene (BTBD9-associated with restless legs 
syndrome; rs9357271); and in the Transferrin gene (TF; rs2280673 and rs1830084). 
Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the 
effect of each SNP on ferritin levels and the risk of iron deficiency (ferritin 
< 15 ng/mL).
RESULTS: In HFE, the G-allele of rs1800562 was associated with lower iron stores 
in both sexes. This was also true for the C-allele of rs179945, but in men only. 
Also, the T-allele of TMPRSS6 rs855791 was negatively associated with iron 
stores in men. Homozygocity for C in rs1799945 was associated with iron 
deficiency in women. Results for all other genetic variants were insignificant.
CONCLUSION: Genetic variants associated with hemochromatosis may protect donors 
against depleted iron stores. In addition, we showed that presence of the 
T-allele at rs855791 in TMPRSS6 was associated with lower iron stores in men.
