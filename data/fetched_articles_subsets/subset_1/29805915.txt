PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(MTB), remains a major public health threat globally. Several lines of evidence 
support a role for host genetic factors in resistance/susceptibility to TB 
disease and MTB infection. However, results across candidate gene and 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are largely inconsistent, so a cohesive 
genetic model underlying TB risk has not emerged.
RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the difficulties in identifying consistent genetic 
associations, genetic studies of TB and MTB infection have revealed a few 
well-documented loci. These well validated genes are presented in this review, 
but there remains a large gap in how these genes translate into better 
understanding of TB. To address this, we present a pathway based extension of 
standard association analyses, seeding the results with the best validated genes 
from candidate gene and GWAS studies.
SUMMARY: Several pathways were significantly enriched using pathway analyses 
that may help to explain population patterns of TB risk. In conclusion, we 
advocate for novel approaches to the study of host genetic analysis of TB that 
extend traditional association approaches.
