Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive and non-ionizing 
technique, enabling in vivo investigation of cardiac metabolism in normal and 
diseased hearts. In vivo measurement tools are critical for studying mechanisms 
that regulate cardiac energy metabolism in disease developments and to assist in 
early response assessments to novel therapies. For cardiac MRS, proton (1H), 
phosphorus (31P), and hyperpolarized 13-carbon (13C) provide valuable metabolic 
information for diagnosis and treatment assessment purposes. Currently, low 
sensitivity and some technical limitations limit the utility of MRS. An 
essential step in translating MRS for clinical use involves further 
technological improvements, particularly in coil design, improving the 
signal-to-noise ratios, field homogeneity, and optimizing radiofrequency 
sequences. This review addresses the recent advances in metabolic imaging by MRS 
from primarily the literature published since 2015.
