Single-nucleus ATAC sequencing (snATAC-seq) employs a hyperactive Tn5 
transposase to gain precise information about the cis-regulatory elements in 
specific cell types. However, the standard protocol of snATAC-seq is not 
optimized for all tissues, including the brain. Here, we present a modified 
protocol for single-nuclei isolation from postmortem frozen human brain tissue, 
followed by snATAC-seq library preparation and sequencing. We also describe an 
integrated bioinformatics analysis pipeline using an R package (ArchRtoSignac) 
to robustly analyze snATAC-seq data. For complete details on the use and 
execution of this protocol, please refer to Morabito et al. (2021).
