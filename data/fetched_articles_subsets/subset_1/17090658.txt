The pivotal event for sterol-induced degradation of the cholesterol biosynthetic 
enzyme HMG-CoA reductase is binding of its membrane domain to Insig proteins in 
the endoplasmic reticulum. Insigs are carriers for gp78, an E3 ubiquitin ligase 
that marks reductase for proteasomal degradation. We report here the isolation 
of mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines, designated SRD-16, -17, and -18, in 
which sterol-induced ubiquitination and degradation of reductase are severely 
impaired. These cells were produced by chemical mutagenesis and selection with 
SR-12813, a compound that mimics sterols in stimulating ubiquitination and 
degradation of reductase. Each SRD cell line was found to contain a point 
mutation in one reductase allele, resulting in substitutions of aspartate for 
serine-60 (SRD-16), arginine for glycine-87 (SRD-17), and proline for 
alanine-333 (SRD-18). Sterols failed to promote ubiquitination and degradation 
of these reductase mutants, owing to their decreased affinity for Insigs. Thus, 
three different point mutations in reductase, all of which localize to the 
membrane domain, disrupt Insig binding and abolish sterol-accelerated 
degradation of the enzyme.
