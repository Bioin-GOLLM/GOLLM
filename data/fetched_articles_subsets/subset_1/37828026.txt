Tumors acquire alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in an 
adaptive walk through the fitness landscape of tumorigenesis. However, the 
interactions between oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that shape this 
landscape remain poorly resolved and cannot be revealed by human cancer genomics 
alone. Here, we use a multiplexed, autochthonous mouse platform to model and 
quantify the initiation and growth of more than one hundred genotypes of lung 
tumors across four oncogenic contexts: KRAS G12D, KRAS G12C, BRAF V600E, and 
EGFR L858R. We show that the fitness landscape is rugged-the effect of tumor 
suppressor inactivation often switches between beneficial and deleterious 
depending on the oncogenic context-and shows no evidence of diminishing-returns 
epistasis within variants of the same oncogene. These findings argue against a 
simple linear signaling relationship amongst these three oncogenes and imply a 
critical role for off-axis signaling in determining the fitness effects of 
inactivating tumor suppressors.
