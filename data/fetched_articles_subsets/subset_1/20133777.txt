Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type T (PTPRT) is the most frequently 
mutated tyrosine phosphatase in human cancers. However, the cell signaling 
pathways regulated by PTPRT largely remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that 
paxillin is a direct substrate of PTPRT and that PTPRT specifically regulates 
paxillin phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 88 (Y88) in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
cells. We engineered CRC cells homozygous for a paxillin Y88F knock-in mutant 
and found that these cells exhibit significantly reduced cell migration and 
impaired anchorage-independent growth, fail to form xenograft tumors in nude 
mice, and have decreased phosphorylation of p130CAS, SHP2, and AKT. PTPRT 
knockout mice that we generated exhibit increased levels of colonic paxillin 
phosphorylation at residue Y88 and are highly susceptible to carcinogen 
azoxymethane-induced colon tumor, providing critical in vivo evidence that PTPRT 
normally functions as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, similarly increased paxillin 
pY88 is also found as a common feature of human colon cancers. These studies 
reveal an important signaling pathway that plays a critical role in colorectal 
tumorigenesis.
