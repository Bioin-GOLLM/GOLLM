Aging is a process of cellular and tissue dysfunction characterized by different 
hallmarks, including cellular senescence. However, there is proof that certain 
features of aging and senescence can be ameliorated. Here, we provide evidence 
that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) isolated from primary fibroblasts of 
young human donors ameliorate certain biomarkers of senescence in cells derived 
from old and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome donors. Importantly, sEVs from 
young cells ameliorate senescence in a variety of tissues in old mice. 
Mechanistically, we identified sEVs to have intrinsic glutathione-S-transferase 
activity partially due to the high levels of expression of the 
glutathione-related protein (GSTM2). Transfection of recombinant GSTM2 into sEVs 
derived from old fibroblasts restores their antioxidant capacity. sEVs increase 
the levels of reduced glutathione and decrease oxidative stress and lipid 
peroxidation both in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, our data provide an 
indication of the potential of sEVs as regenerative therapy in aging.
