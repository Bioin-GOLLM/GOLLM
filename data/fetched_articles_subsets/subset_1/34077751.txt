Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a World Health Organization 
priority pathogen. CCHFV infections cause a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever for 
which specific treatments and vaccines are urgently needed. Here, we 
characterize the human immune response to natural CCHFV infection to identify 
potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) targeting the viral 
glycoprotein. Competition experiments showed that these nAbs bind six distinct 
antigenic sites in the Gc subunit. These sites were further delineated through 
mutagenesis and mapped onto a prefusion model of Gc. Pairwise screening 
identified combinations of non-competing nAbs that afford synergistic 
neutralization. Further enhancements in neutralization breadth and potency were 
attained by physically linking variable domains of synergistic nAb pairs through 
bispecific antibody (bsAb) engineering. Although multiple nAbs protected mice 
from lethal CCHFV challenge in pre- or post-exposure prophylactic settings, only 
a single bsAb, DVD-121-801, afforded therapeutic protection. DVD-121-801 is a 
promising candidate suitable for clinical development as a CCHFV therapeutic.
