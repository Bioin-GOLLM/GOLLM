Enzyme replacement therapy is currently the only approved treatment for Pompe 
disease, due to acid α-glucosidase deficiency. Clinical efficacy of this 
approach is variable, and more effective therapies are needed. We showed in 
preclinical studies that chaperones stabilize the recombinant enzyme used for 
enzyme replacement therapy. Here, we evaluated the effects of a combination of 
enzyme therapy and a chaperone on α-glucosidase activity in Pompe disease 
patients. α-Glucosidase activity was analyzed by tandem-mass spectrometry in 
dried blood spots from patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy, either 
alone or in combination with the chaperone N-butyldeoxynojirimycin given at the 
time of the enzyme infusion. Thirteen patients with different presentations (3 
infantile-onset, 10 late-onset) were enrolled. In 11 patients, the combination 
treatment resulted in α-glucosidase activities greater than 1.85-fold the 
activities with enzyme replacement therapy alone. In the whole patient 
population, α-glucosidase activity was significantly increased at 12 hours 
(2.19-fold, P = 0.002), 24 hours (6.07-fold, P = 0.001), and 36 hours 
(3.95-fold, P = 0.003). The areas under the curve were also significantly 
increased (6.78-fold, P = 0.002). These results suggest improved stability of 
recombinant α-glucosidase in blood in the presence of the chaperone.
