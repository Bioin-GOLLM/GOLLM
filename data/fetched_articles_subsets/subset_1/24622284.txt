In August 2012, the Houston Department of Health contacted CDC regarding the 
rare transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) likely by sexual contact 
between two women. The case was investigated, and laboratory testing confirmed 
that the woman with newly diagnosed HIV infection had a virus virtually 
identical to that of her female partner, who was diagnosed previously with HIV 
and who had stopped receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2010. This report 
describes this case of HIV infection, likely acquired by female-to-female sexual 
transmission during the 6-month monogamous relationship of the HIV-discordant 
couple (one negative, one positive). The woman with newly acquired infection did 
not report any other recognized risk factors for HIV infection, and the viruses 
infecting the two women had â‰¥ 98% sequence identity in three genes. The couple 
had not received any preventive counseling before acquisition of the virus by 
the woman who had tested negative for HIV. HIV-discordant couples should receive 
counseling regarding safer sex practices, and HIV-infected partners should be 
linked to and retained in medical care.
