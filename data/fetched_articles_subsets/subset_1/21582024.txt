Nithya P, Hathwar VR, Maiyalagan T, Kazak C, Nawaz Khan F.

In the title moleclue, C(19)H(21)NO, the 4-piperidone ring adopts a chair 
conformation in which the two benzene rings and the methyl group attached to C 
atoms all have equatorial orientations. In the crystal structure, 
centrosymmetric dimers are formed through weak inter-molecular C-H⋯O hydrogen 
bonds [the dihedral angle between the aromatic rings is 58.51 (5)°].
