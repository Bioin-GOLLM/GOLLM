DNA repeat expansion disorders are a group of neuromuscular and 
neurodegenerative diseases that arise from the inheritance of long tracts of 
nucleotide repetitions, located in the regulatory region, introns, or inside the 
coding sequence of a gene. Although loss of protein expression and/or the gain 
of function of its transcribed mRNA or translated product represent the major 
pathogenic effect of these pathologies, mitochondrial dysfunction and imbalance 
in redox homeostasis are reported as common features in these disorders, deeply 
affecting their severity and progression. In this review, we examine the role 
that the redox imbalance plays in the pathological mechanisms of DNA expansion 
disorders and the recent advances on antioxidant treatments, particularly 
focusing on the expression and the activity of the transcription factor NRF2, 
the main cellular regulator of the antioxidant response.
