Arsenic is a well-known human bladder and liver carcinogen, but its exact 
mechanism of carcinogenicity is not fully understood. Dimethylarsinic acid 
(DMAV) is a major urinary metabolite of sodium arsenite (iAsIII) and induces 
urinary bladder cancers in rats. DMAV and iAsIII are negative in in vitro 
mutagenicity tests. However, their in vivo mutagenicities have not been 
determined. The purpose of present study is to evaluate the in vivo 
mutagenicities of DMAV and iAsIII in rat urinary bladder epithelium and liver 
using gpt delta F344 rats. Ten-week old male gpt delta F344 rats were randomized 
into 3 groups and administered 0, 92mg/L DMAV, or 87mg/L iAsIII (each 50mg/L As) 
for 13weeks in the drinking water. In the mutation assay, point mutations are 
detected in the gpt gene by 6-thioguanine selection (gpt assay) and deletion 
mutations are identified in the red/gam genes by Spi- selection (Spi- assay). 
Results of the gpt and Spi- assays showed that DMAV and iAsIII had no effects on 
the mutant frequencies or mutation spectrum in urinary bladder epithelium or 
liver. These findings indicate that DMAV and iAsIII are not mutagenic in urinary 
bladder epithelium or liver in rats.
