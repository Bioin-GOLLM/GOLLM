The effect of the venom of the Chactoid family of scorpions on blood pressure 
was scantly investigated and was addressed in the present study using the venom 
of the Israeli scorpion, Scorpio maurus palmatus. Blood pressure in rats was 
monitored via cannulated femoral artery, while venom and toxins were introduced 
into femoral vein. Venom injection elicited a biphasic effect, expressed first 
by a fast and transient hypotensive response, which lasted up to 10 min, 
followed by a hypertensive response, which lasted up to one hour. It was found 
that these effects resulted from different venom components. Phospholipase A₂ 
produced the hypotensive effect, while a non-enzymatic neurotoxic polypeptide 
fraction produced the hypertensive effect. Surprisingly, the main neurotoxic 
polypeptide to mice had no effect on blood pressure. In vitro experiments 
indicated that the hypertensive factors caused histamine release from the 
peritoneal mast cells, but this effect is assumed to be not relevant to their in 
vivo effect. In spite of the cytotoxic activity of phospholipase A₂, it did not 
release histamine. These findings suggest that the effects of venom and isolated 
fractions on blood pressure parameters are mediated by different mechanisms, 
which deserve further pharmacological investigation.
