INTRODUCTION: Up to one third of total joint replacement patients (TJR) 
experience poor surgical outcome.
OBJECTIVES: To identify metabolomic signatures for non-responders to TJR in 
primary osteoarthritis (OA) patients.
METHODS: A newly developed differential correlation network analysis method was 
applied to our previously published metabolomic dataset to identify metabolomic 
network signatures for non-responders to TJR.
RESULTS: Differential correlation networks involving 12 metabolites and 23 
metabolites were identified for pain non-responders and function non-responders, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The differential networks suggest that inflammation, muscle 
breakdown, wound healing, and metabolic syndrome may all play roles in TJR 
response, warranting further investigation.
