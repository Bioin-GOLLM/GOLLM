Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose can cause hepatotoxicity by inducing mitochondrial 
damage and subsequent necrosis in hepatocytes. Sirtuin2 (Sirt2) is an 
NAD+-dependent deacetylase that regulates several biological processes, 
including hepatic gluconeogenesis, as well as inflammatory pathways. We show 
that APAP decreases the expression of Sirt2. Moreover, the ablation of Sirt2 
attenuates APAP-induced liver injuries, such as oxidative stress and 
mitochondrial damage in hepatocytes. We found that Sirt2 deficiency alleviates 
the APAP-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and phosphorylation of the 
p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). Moreover, Sirt2 interacts with and 
deacetylates S6K1, followed by S6K1 phosphorylation induction. This study 
elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective role of Sirt2 
inactivation in APAP-induced liver injuries. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(3): 190-195].
