Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a major global health burden, causing 
chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Toll-like receptors 
(TLRs) are evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors that detect 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns and activate downstream signaling to 
induce proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. An increasing number 
of studies have suggested the importance of TLR responses in the outcome of HCV 
infection. However, the exact role of innate immune responses, including TLR 
response, in controlling chronic HCV infection remains to be established. A 
proper understanding of the TLR response in HCV infection is essential for 
devising new therapeutic approaches against HCV infection. In this review, we 
discuss the progress made in our understanding of the host innate immune 
response to HCV infection, with a particular focus on the TLR response. In 
addition, we discuss the mechanisms adopted by HCV to avoid immune surveillance 
mediated by TLRs.
