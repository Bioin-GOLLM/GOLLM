BACKGROUND & AIMS: We undertook a cross-sectional study of children/adolescents 
with and without non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to compare the 
prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes, and to examine the role of abnormal 
glucose tolerance as a predictor of liver disease severity.
METHODS: We recruited a cohort of 599 Caucasian children/adolescents with 
biopsy-proven NAFLD, and 118 children/adolescents without NAFLD, who were 
selected to be similar for age, sex, body mass index and waist circumference to 
those with NAFLD. The diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes was based on either 
hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose or 2 h post-load glucose concentrations.
RESULTS: Children/adolescents with NAFLD had a significantly higher prevalence 
of abnormal glucose tolerance (prediabetes or diabetes) than those without NAFLD 
(20.6% vs. 11%, p = 0.02). In particular, 124 (20.6%) children/adolescents with 
NAFLD had abnormal glucose tolerance, with 19.8% (n = 119) satisfying the 
diagnostic criteria for prediabetes and 0.8% (n = 5) satisfying the criteria for 
diabetes. The combined presence of prediabetes and diabetes was associated with 
a nearly 2.2-fold increased risk of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; 
unadjustedodds ratio 2.19; 95% CI 1.47-3.29; p <0.001). However, this 
association was attenuated (but remained significant) after adjustment for age, 
sex, waist circumference (adjustedodds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.06-2.69, p = 0.032), 
and the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism. Both this PNPLA3 polymorphism and waist 
circumference were strongly associated with NASH.
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal glucose tolerance (especially prediabetes) is highly 
prevalent among children/adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD. These children 
also have a higher risk of NASH, though central adiposity is the factor that is 
most strongly associated with NASH.
LAY SUMMARY: Children with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) have a higher prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (prediabetes or 
type 2 diabetes) than children without NAFLD. Children with biopsy-proven NAFLD 
and abnormal glucose tolerance also have a higher prevalence of the progressive 
form of disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, than those with normal glucose 
tolerance, though central adiposity is the factor that is most strongly 
associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
