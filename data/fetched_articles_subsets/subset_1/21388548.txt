BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Systemic chronic inflammation is linked to metabolic 
syndrome, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Gram 
negative microbial product, triggers inflammation through toll-like-receptor-4 
(TLR-4) signaling. It has been reported that dietary fatty acids also modulate 
inflammation through TLR-4. We investigated whether fish oil (FO) rich diet in 
comparison to saturated fat (SF) rich diet would confer protection from 
pathologies induced by LPS.
METHODS: Twenty C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups. One group received 
FO-diet and other received SF-diet ad libitum for 60 days. Diets were isocaloric 
containing 45% energy from fat. After 60-days of feeding, blood was collected 
after overnight fast. Mice were allowed to recover for 4-days, fasted for 
5-hours, challenged with 100 ng/mL of LPS intraperitonially, and bled after 
2-hours. After 7-days of recuperation, mice were challenged with 500 ng/mL of 
LPS intraperitonially and observed for physical health.
RESULTS: Food intake was similar in FO- and SF-fed mice. FO-fed mice compared to 
SF-fed mice had significantly less body weight gain (P = 0.005), epididymal fat 
weight (P = 0.005), fasting blood glucose (70.8 vs 83.3 ng/dL; P < 0.05), 
HOMA-IR (5.0 vs 13.6; P < 0.019), and serum cholesterol (167 vs 94 mg/dL; P < 
0.05). When challenged with LPS, FO-fed mice had significantly lower serum IL-1Î² 
compared to SF-fed mice (2.0 vs 30.0 pg/mL; P < 0.001). After LPS-challenge, 
SF-fed mice had higher mortality, lost more body weight, and had greater 
decrease in blood glucose compared to FO-fed mice.
CONCLUSION: Overall, FO-diet compared to SF-diet offered protection against 
deleterious effects of LPS in mice.
