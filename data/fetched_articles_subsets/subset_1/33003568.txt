Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a member of the class III receptor tyrosine 
kinases (RTK) and is involved in cell survival, proliferation, and 
differentiation of haematopoietic progenitors of lymphoid and myeloid lineages. 
Oncogenic mutations in the FLT3 gene resulting in constitutively active FLT3 
variants are frequently found in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and 
correlate with patient's poor survival. Targeting FLT3 mutant leukaemic stem 
cells (LSC) is a key to efficient treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory 
AML. It is therefore essential to understand how LSC escape current therapies in 
order to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we summarize the current 
knowledge on mechanisms of FLT3 activity regulation and its cellular 
consequences. Furthermore, we discuss how aberrant FLT3 signalling cooperates 
with other oncogenic lesions and the microenvironment to drive haematopoietic 
malignancies and how this can be harnessed for therapeutical purposes.
