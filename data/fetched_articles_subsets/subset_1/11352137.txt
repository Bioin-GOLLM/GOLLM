We tested the hypothesis that blood pressure (BP) responses to physical and 
mental stress are associated with polymorphisms in the beta-2 adrenergic 
receptor (AR) gene. We studied normotensive, young, monozygotic (MZ) and 
dizygotic (DZ) twins. The subjects underwent automated BP measurements at the 
brachial and digital arteries and were subjected to mental arithmetic and cold 
pressor stress. We used allele-specific PCR to genotype four single nucleotide 
polymorphisms in the beta-2 AR gene. The most functionally relevant polymorphism 
in the beta-2 AR gene, Arg16/Gly, was associated with systolic and diastolic BP 
under resting conditions, during mental arithmetic, and during the cold pressor 
test, as well as with the increase in diastolic BP during both forms of stress. 
These findings support a role for the beta-2 AR gene in BP regulation. They also 
indicate that the beta-2 AR gene influences the level of not only resting but 
also stress-related BP.
