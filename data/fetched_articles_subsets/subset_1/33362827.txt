Lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRLKs), a plant-specific receptor-like kinase 
(RLK) sub-family, have been recently found to play crucial roles in plant 
development and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. In this review, we 
first describe the classification and structures of Lectin RLKs. Then we focus 
on the analysis of functions of LecRLKs in various biological processes and 
discuss the status of LecRLKs from the ligands they recognize, substrate they 
target, signaling pathways they are involved in, to the overall regulation of 
growth-defense tradeoffs. LecRLKs and the signaling components they interact 
with constitute recognition and protection systems at the plant cell surface 
contributing to the detection of environmental changes monitoring plant fitness.
