BACKGROUND: Pirfenidone is the first antifibrotic drug approved for the 
treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and it is used in the treatment 
of other interstitial pneumonias, such as unclassifiable interstitial lung 
disease (ILD) and connective tissue-related ILD. This study examined the 
efficacy of pirfenidone in patients with IPF and fibrotic idiopathic 
non-specific interstitial pneumonia (f-iNSIP).
METHODS: In a retrospective real-life study, 67 IPF and 24 f-iNSIP patients were 
enrolled and classified into a pirfenidone group and a non-antifibrotic group. 
The level of forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of lung for 
carbon monoxide (DLco) at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months were recorded. The level 
of KL-6 in serum was detected by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (﻿CLEIA). 
The prognosis and safety outcomes were collected from patients.
RESULTS: In IPF patients, pirfenidone decreased the mean change of FVC and DLco, 
and decreased the proportion of patients with a ⩾10% decline in FVC or a ⩾15% 
decline in DLco compared with the non-antifibrotic group. There was no 
difference in the mean change of FVC and DLco between smokers and non-smokers 
who received pirfenidone treatment. There was an improvement in progression-free 
survival, defined as the time to the first occurrence of acute exacerbation or 
death related to pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, the ratio of patients who 
experienced acute exacerbation and death related to pulmonary fibrosis was lower 
in the pirfenidone group. There was no change in lung function and prognosis 
between the pirfenidone and non-antifibrotic groups in f-iNSIP patients. The 
KL-6 level slightly decreased after 1 year of pirfenidone treatment but not 
significantly. Gastrointestinal and skin-related adverse events were most 
common, and four patients ceased treatment due to the side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone safely reduced disease progression by improving the 
lung function and progression-free survival in IPF patients, with acceptable 
side effects. The efficacy of pirfenidone on f-iNSIP was not significant, 
suggesting the need for further studies.The reviews of this paper are available
