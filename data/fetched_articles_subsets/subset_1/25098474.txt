Schizophrenia is a severe psychotic disorder with recurrent relapse and 
functional impairment. It results from a poorly understood gene-environment 
interaction. The Taq1A polymorphism (located in the gene cluster NTAD) is a 
likely candidate for schizophrenia. Its rs1800497 polymorphism was shown to be 
associated with DRD2 gene expression. Therefore the present work aims to 
investigate a possible association between schizophrenia and such polymorphism. 
The compared distribution of the alleles and genotypes of the studied 
polymorphism was investigated in a Brazilian sample of 235 patients and 834 
controls. Genotypic frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was a 
trend of allelic association between the Taq1A polymorphism (rs1800497) with 
schizophrenia in the studied sample. However no statistically differences were 
found between cases and controls when analyzed by gender or schizophrenia 
subtypes.
