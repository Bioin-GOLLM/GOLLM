BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several genotypes associate with a worse histopathological 
profile in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Whether 
genotypes impact long-term outcomes is unclear. We investigated the importance 
of PNPLA3, TM6SF2, MBOAT7 and GCKR genotype for the development of severe 
outcomes in NAFLD.
METHOD: DNA samples were collected from 546 patients with NAFLD. Advanced 
fibrosis was diagnosed by liver biopsy or elastography. Non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) was histologically defined. Additionally, 5396 controls 
matched for age, sex and municipality were identified from population-based 
registers. Events of severe liver disease and all-cause mortality were collected 
from national registries. Hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age, sex, body mass 
index and type 2 diabetes were estimated with Cox regression.
RESULTS: In NAFLD, the G/G genotype of PNPLA3 was associated with a higher 
prevalence of NASH at baseline (odds ratio [OR] 3.67, 95% CI = 1.66-8.08), but 
not with advanced fibrosis (OR 1.81, 95% CI = 0.79-4.14). After up to 40 years 
of follow-up, the PNPLA3 G/G genotype was associated with a higher rate of 
severe liver disease (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.27, 95% CI = 1.15-4.47) 
compared with the C/C variant. NAFLD patients developed cirrhosis at a higher 
rate than controls (aHR 9.00, 95% CI = 6.85-11.83). The PNPLA3 G/G genotype 
accentuated this rate (aHR 23.32, 95% = CI 9.14-59.47). Overall mortality was 
not affected by any genetic variant.
CONCLUSION: The PNPLA3 G/G genotype is associated with an increased rate of 
cirrhosis in NAFLD. Our results suggest that assessment of the PNPLA3 genotype 
is of clinical relevance in patients with NAFLD to individualize monitoring and 
therapeutic strategies.
