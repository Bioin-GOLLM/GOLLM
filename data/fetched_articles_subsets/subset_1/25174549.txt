BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a 
zoonotic infection causing severe viral pneumonia, with index cases having 
resided in or recently travelled to the Arabian peninsula, and is a global 
concern for public health. Limited human-to-human transmission, leading to some 
case clusters, has been reported. MERS-CoV has been reported in dromedary camels 
but phenotypic characterisation of such viruses is limited. We aimed to compare 
MERS-CoV isolates from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia and Egypt with a prototype 
human MERS-CoV to assess virus replication competence and cell tropism in 
ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung.
METHODS: We characterised MERS-CoV viruses from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia and 
Egypt and compared them with a human MERS-CoV reference strain. We assessed 
viral replication kinetics and competence in Vero-E6 cells (rhesus monkey), 
tissue tropism in cultures of ex-vivo human bronchial and lung tissues, and 
cytokine and chemokine induction, gene expression, and quantification of viral 
RNA in Calu-3 cells (human respiratory tract). We used mock-infected tissue as 
negative controls for ex-vivo experiments and influenza A H5N1 as a positive 
control for cytokine and chemokine induction experiments in Calu-3 cells.
FINDINGS: We isolated three dromedary strains, two from Saudi Arabia 
(Dromedary/Al-Hasa-KFU-HKU13/2013 [AH13] and Dromedary/Al-Hasa-KFU-HKU19D/2013 
[AH19D]), and one from Egypt (Dromedary/Egypt-NRCE-HKU270/2013 [NRCE-HKU270]). 
The human and dromedary MERS-CoV strains had similar viral replication 
competence in Vero-E6 cells and respiratory tropism in ex-vivo cultures of the 
human respiratory tract, and had similar ability to evade interferon responses 
in the human-respiratory-tract-derived cell line Calu-3.
INTERPRETATION: The similarity of virus tropism and replication competence of 
human and dromedary MERS-CoV from the Arabian peninsula, and genetically diverse 
dromedary viruses from Egypt, in ex-vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract 
suggests that dromedary viruses from Saudi Arabia and Egypt are probably 
infectious to human beings. Exposure to zoonotic MERS-CoV is probably occurring 
in a wider geographical region beyond the Arabian peninsula.
