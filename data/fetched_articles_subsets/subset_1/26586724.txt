This study aims to evaluate the effect on killing efficacy of the intracellular 
trafficking patterns of α-particle emitters by using different radionuclide 
carriers in the setting of targeted antivascular α-radiotherapy. Nanocarriers 
(lipid vesicles) targeted to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), 
which is unique to human neovasculature for a variety of solid tumors, were 
loaded with the α-particle generator actinium-225 and were compared with a 
PSMA-targeted radiolabeled antibody. Actinium-225 emits a total of four 
α-particles per decay, providing highly lethal and localized irradiation of 
targeted cells with minimal exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. Lipid 
vesicles were derivatized with two types of PSMA-targeting ligands: a fully 
human PSMA antibody (mAb) and a urea-based, low-molecular-weight agent. Target 
selectivity and extent of internalization were evaluated on monolayers of human 
endothelial cells (HUVEC) induced to express PSMA in static incubation 
conditions and in a flow field. Both types of radiolabeled PSMA-targeted 
vesicles exhibit similar killing efficacy, which is greater than the efficacy of 
the radiolabeled control mAb when compared on the basis of delivered 
radioactivity per cell. Fluorescence confocal microscopy demonstrates that 
targeted vesicles localize closer to the nucleus, unlike antibodies which 
localize near the plasma membrane. In addition, targeted vesicles cause larger 
numbers of dsDNAs per nucleus of treated cells compared with the radiolabeled 
mAb. These findings demonstrate that radionuclide carriers, such as 
PSMA-targeted lipid-nanocarriers, which localize close to the nucleus, increase 
the probability of α-particle trajectories crossing the nuclei, and, therefore, 
enhance the killing efficacy of α-particle emitters.
