The poor prognosis of most cases of advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) 
constitutes a severe problem in modern oncology, which is aggravated by the fact 
that the incidence of this liver cancer is increasing worldwide and is often 
diagnosed late, when surgical removal is not feasible. The difficulty of dealing 
with this deadly tumor is augmented by the heterogeneity of CCA subtypes and the 
complexity of mechanisms involved in enhanced proliferation, apoptosis 
avoidance, chemoresistance, invasiveness, and metastasis that characterize CCA. 
Among the regulatory processes implicated in developing these malignant traits, 
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a pivotal role. Alteration of β-catenin 
expression and subcellular localization has been associated with worse outcomes 
in some CCA subtypes. This heterogeneity, which also affects cellular and in 
vivo models commonly used to study CCA biology and anticancer drug development, 
must be taken into account for CCA investigation to more accurately extrapolate 
basic laboratory research to the clinical situation. A better understanding of 
the altered Wnt/β-catenin pathway in relationship with the heterogeneous forms 
of CCA is mandatory for developing novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic 
strategies for patients suffering from this lethal disease.
