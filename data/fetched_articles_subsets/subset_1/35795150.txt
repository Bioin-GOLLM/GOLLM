AIMS: This study aimed to determine the association of plasma neurofilament 
light (NfL), a marker of neurodegeneration, with diabetes status and glycaemic 
parameters in people with normal glycaemia (NG), pre-diabetes (PD) and type 2 
diabetes (T2D).
METHODS: Clinical and descriptive data for the diagnostic groups, NG (n=30), PD 
(n=48) and T2D (n=29), aged between 40 and 75 years were included in this 
cross-sectional analysis. Plasma NfL levels were analyzed using the 
ultra-sensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) platform.
RESULTS: A positive correlation was evident between plasma NfL and fasting 
glucose (r = 0.2824; p = 0.0032). Plasma NfL levels were not correlated with 
fasting insulin and insulin resistance. Plasma Nfl levels were significantly 
different across the diabetes groups (T2D >PD >NG, p=0.0046). Post-hoc analysis 
indicated significantly higher plasma NfL levels in the T2D [12.4 (5.21) pg/mL] 
group than in the PD [10.2 (4.13) pg/mL] and NG [8.37 (5.65) pg/mL] groups. The 
relationship between diabetes status and NfL remained significant after 
adjusting for age, sex, BMI, HOMA-IR and physical activity (adjusted r2 = 0.271, 
p = 0.035).
CONCLUSIONS: These results show biomarker evidence of neurodegeneration in 
adults at risk or with T2D. Larger sample size and longitudinal analysis are 
required to better understand the application of NfL in people with risk and 
overt T2D.
