By acquiring, processing, and presenting both foreign and self-antigens, 
dendritic cells (DCs) initiate T cell activation that is shaped through the 
immunomodulatory functions of a variety of cell-membrane-bound molecules 
including BTLA-HVEM, CD40-CD40L, CTLA-4-CD80/CD86, CD70-CD27, ICOS-ICOS-L, 
OX40-OX40L, and PD-L1-PD-1, as well as several key cytokines and enzymes such as 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12, IL-23, IL-27, transforming growth factor-beta 1 
(TGF-Î²1), retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (Raldh), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 
(IDO). Some of these distinct immunomodulatory signals are mediated by specific 
subsets of DCs, therefore contributing to the functional specialization of DCs 
in the priming and regulation of immune responses. In addition to responding to 
the DC-mediated signals, T cells can reciprocally modulate the immunomodulatory 
capacities of DCs, further refining immune responses. Here, we review recent 
studies, particularly in experimental mouse systems, that have delineated the 
integrated mechanisms of crucial immunomodulatory pathways that enable specific 
populations of DCs and T cells to work intimately together as single functional 
units that are indispensable for the maintenance of immune homeostasis.
