The great majority of sporadic vestibular schwannomas (VSs) are due to the 
inactivation of the NF2 gene. In this study, we found age-dependent differences 
in the clinical parameters of sporadic VSs. Young patients were characterized by 
progressive tumour behaviours, including earlier onset of initial symptoms, 
shorter symptom duration and larger tumour size. An increased rate of "two-hits" 
of both NF2 alleles, usually by mutation and allelic loss, was observed in young 
cases compared to older, and this correlated with the loss of protein and mRNA 
expression. In contrast, the tumours with a single mutation (referred to as 
'one-hit') exhibited obvious expression levels. Moreover, a mixture of 
merlin-expressing tumour cells and non-expressing tumour cells was observed in 
'one-hit' schwannomas, suggesting that a subset of 'one-hit' tumour cells was 
present in these tumours. To mimic the growth promoting effects by the second 
hit, we performed lentivirus-mediated NF2 knockdown in the 'one-hit' schwannoma 
cultures. Following the loss of NF2 expression, schwannoma cultures demonstrated 
increased proliferation rates. Above all, we have identified a correlation 
between the NF2 status and the growth patterns of sporadic VSs. The treatment 
decision-making, microsurgery or "wait and scan" strategy, should be carried out 
according to the tumour's genetic background.
