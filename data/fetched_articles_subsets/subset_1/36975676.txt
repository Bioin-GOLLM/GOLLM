A key element in ensuring successful immunization is the efficient delivery of 
vaccines. However, poor immunogenicity and adverse inflammatory immunogenic 
reactions make the establishment of an efficient vaccine delivery method a 
challenging task. The delivery of vaccines has been performed via a variety of 
delivery methods, including natural-polymer-based carriers that are relatively 
biocompatible and have low toxicity. The incorporation of adjuvants or antigens 
into biomaterial-based immunizations has demonstrated better immune response 
than formulations that just contain the antigen. This system may enable 
antigen-mediated immunogenicity and shelter and transport the cargo vaccine or 
antigen to the appropriate target organ. In this regard, this work reviews the 
recent applications of natural polymer composites from different sources, such 
as animals, plants, and microbes, in vaccine delivery systems.
