Aβ-related cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a major cause of primary 
non-traumatic brain hemorrhage. In families with an early onset of the disease, 
CAA can be due to amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathogenic variants or 
duplications. APP duplications lead to a ~1.5-fold increased APP expression, 
resulting in Aβ overproduction and deposition in the walls of leptomeningeal 
vessels. We hypothesized that rare variants in the 3'untranslated region (UTR) 
of APP might lead to APP overexpression in patients with CAA and no APP 
pathogenic variant or duplication. We performed direct sequencing of the whole 
APP 3'UTR in 90 patients with CAA and explored the functional consequences of 
one previously unreported variant. We identified three sequence variants in four 
patients, of which a two-base pair deletion (c.*331_*332del) was previously 
unannotated and absent from 175 controls of same ethnicity. This latter variant 
was associated with increased APP expression in vivo and in vitro. 
Bioinformatics and functional assays showed that the APP c.*331_*332del variant 
affected APP messenger RNA (mRNA) structure and binding of two microRNAs 
(miR-582-3p and miR-892b), providing a mechanism for the observed effects on APP 
expression. These results identify APP 3'UTR sequence variants as genetic 
determinants of Aβ-CAA.
