Organ fibrosis represents a dysregulated, maladaptive wound repair response that 
results in progressive disruption of normal tissue architecture leading to 
detrimental deterioration in physiological function, and significant 
morbidity/mortality. Fibrosis is thought to contribute to nearly 50% of all 
deaths in the Western world with current treatment modalities effective in 
slowing disease progression but not effective in restoring organ function or 
reversing fibrotic changes. When physiological wound repair is complete, 
myofibroblasts are programmed to undergo cell death and self-clearance, however, 
in fibrosis there is a characteristic absence of myofibroblast apoptosis. It has 
been shown that in fibrosis, myofibroblasts adopt an apoptotic-resistant, highly 
proliferative phenotype leading to persistent myofibroblast activation and 
perpetuation of the fibrotic disease process. Recently, this pathological 
adaptation has been linked to dysregulated expression of tumour suppressor gene 
p53. In this review, we discuss p53 dysregulation and apoptotic failure in 
myofibroblasts and demonstrate its consistent link to fibrotic disease 
development in all types of organ fibrosis. An enhanced understanding of the 
role of p53 dysregulation and myofibroblast apoptosis may aid in future novel 
therapeutic and/or diagnostic strategies in organ fibrosis.
