Purpose.18F-FC119S is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging 
β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study is to 
evaluate the efficacy of 18F-FC119S in quantitating Aβ deposition in a mouse 
model of early amyloid deposition (5xFAD) by PET. Method. Dynamic 18F-FC119S PET 
images were obtained in 5xFAD (n = 5) and wild-type (WT) mice (n = 7). The brain 
PET images were spatially normalized to the M. Mirrione T2-weighted mouse brain 
MR template, and the volumes of interest were then automatically drawn on the 
cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. The specific binding of 
18F-FC119S to Aβ was quantified as the distribution volume ratio using Logan 
graphical analysis with the cerebellum as a reference tissue. The Aβ levels in 
the brain were also confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Result. For the 
5xFAD group, radioactivity levels in the cortex, the hippocampus, and the 
thalamus were higher than those for the WT group. In these regions, specific 
binding was approximately 1.2-fold higher in 5xFAD mice than in WT. 
Immunohistochemistry supported these findings; the 5xFAD showed severe Aβ 
deposition in the cortex and hippocampus in contrast to the WT group. 
Conclusion. These results demonstrated that 18F-FC119S PET can successfully 
distinguish Aβ depositions in 5xFAD mice from WT.
