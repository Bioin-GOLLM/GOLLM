Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are highly aggressive and recurrent. 
Standard cytotoxic chemotherapies are currently the main treatment options, but 
their clinical efficacies are limited and patients usually suffer from severe 
side effects. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate targeted 
liposomes-delivered combined chemotherapies to treat TNBCs. Specifically, the 
IC50 values of the microtubule polymerization inhibitor mertansine (DM1), 
mitotic spindle assembly defecting taxane (paclitaxel, PTX), DNA synthesis 
inhibitor gemcitabine (GC), and DNA damage inducer doxorubicin (AC) were tested 
in both TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Then we constructed the 
anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody (mAb) tagged 
liposomes and confirmed its TNBC cell surface binding using flow cytometry, 
internalization with confocal laser scanning microscopy, and TNBC xenograft 
targeting in NSG female mice using In Vivo Imaging System. The safe dosage of 
anti-EGFR liposomal chemotherapies, i.e., <20% body weight change, was 
identified. Finally, the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy studies in TNBC cell 
line-derived xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models revealed that the 
targeted delivery of chemotherapies (mertansine and gemcitabine) can effectively 
inhibit tumor growth. This study demonstrated that the targeted liposomes enable 
the new formulations of combined therapies that improve anti-TNBC efficacy.
