Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane vesicles released into the 
extracellular milieu by cells of various origins. They contain different 
biological cargoes, protecting them from degradation by environmental factors. 
There is an opinion that EVs have a number of advantages over synthetic 
carriers, creating new opportunities for drug delivery. In this review, we 
discuss the ability of EVs to function as carriers for therapeutic nucleic acids 
(tNAs), challenges associated with the use of such carriers in vivo, and various 
strategies for tNA loading into EVs.
