The region of Antioquia in northeastern Colombia has the highest number of 
reported leptospirosis cases in the country. It also shows high seroprevalence 
indexes in the general population and socio-environmental conditions favourable 
for the transmission of the disease between humans and animals. In this study, 
25 Leptospira isolates from Colombia's Antioquia department were identified to 
the species level as L. santarosai (12), L. interrogans (9) and L. meyeri (4) 
using phylogenetic analysis of the Amidohydrolase gene. Typing at the serovar 
level was performed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and monoclonal 
antibodies. The serovars Canalzonae, Babudieri, Alice, Beye, and Copenhageni 
have been identified as causing human or animal infections in Antioquia, 
Colombia. The four environmental isolates were not identified to the serovar 
level. L. santarosai serovar Canalzonae and Alice were identified as new 
etiologic agents of human leptospirosis in Antioquia, Colombia. This paper 
reports species and serovars that were previously unknown in the region.
