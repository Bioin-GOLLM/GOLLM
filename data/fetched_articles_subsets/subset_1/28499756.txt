Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most lethal skin cancer. The Wnt pathway has an 
impact on development, invasion, and metastasis of CM, thus likely affecting CM 
prognosis. Using data from a published genome-wide association study from The 
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, we assessed the associations of 
19,830 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 151 Wnt pathway 
autosomal genes with CM-specific survival and then validated significant SNPs in 
another genome-wide association study from Harvard University. In the 
single-locus analysis, 1,855 SNPs were significantly associated with CM-specific 
survival at P < 0.05, of which 547 SNPs were still considered noteworthy after 
the correction by the false-positive report probability. In the replication, two 
SNPs remained significantly associated with CM-specific survival after multiple 
comparison correction. By performing functional prediction and stepwise 
selection, we identified two independent SNPs (i.e., WNT2B rs1175649 G>T and 
BTRC rs61873997 G>A) that showed a predictive role in CM-specific survival, with 
an effect-allele-attributed hazards ratio (adjusted hazards ratio) of 1.99 (95% 
confidence interval = 1.41-2.81, P = 8.10 × 10-5) and 0.61 (0.46-0.80, 
3.12×10-4), respectively. Collectively, these variants in the Wnt pathway genes 
may be biomarkers for outcomes of patients with CM, if validated by larger 
studies.
