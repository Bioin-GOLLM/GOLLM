BACKGROUND: The hypoxic conditions at high altitudes are great threats to 
survival, causing pressure for adaptation. More and more high-altitude denizens 
are not adapted with the condition known as high-altitude polycythemia (HAPC) 
that featured excessive erythrocytosis. As a high-altitude sickness, the 
etiology of HAPC is still unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we reported the whole-genome sequencing-based study of 
10 native Tibetans with HAPC and 10 control subjects followed by genotyping of 
selected 21 variants from discovered single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in an 
independent cohort (232 cases and 266 controls).
RESULTS: We discovered the egl nine homologue 3 (egln3/phd3) (14q13.1, 
rs1346902, P = 1.91 × 10-5) and PPP1R2P1 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory 
Inhibitor Subunit 2) gene (6p21.32, rs521539, P = 0.012). Our results indicated 
an unbiased framework to identify etiological mechanisms of HAPC and showed that 
egln3/phd3 and PPP1R2P1 may be associated with the susceptibility to HAPC. 
Egln3/phd3b is associated with hypoxia-inducible factor subunit α (HIFα). 
Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Inhibitor is associated with reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) and oxidative stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Our genome sequencing conducted in Tibetan HAPC patients identified 
egln3/phd3 and PPP1R2P1 associated with HAPC.
