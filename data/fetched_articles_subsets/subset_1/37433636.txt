In addition to the main, protein-coding, open reading frame (mORF), many 
eukaryotic mRNAs contain upstream ORFs (uORFs) initiated at AUG or near-cognate 
codons residing 5' of the mORF start site. Whereas translation of uORFs 
generally represses translation of the mORFs, a subset of uORFs serves as a 
nexus for regulating translation of the mORF. In this review, we summarize the 
mechanisms by which uORFs can repress or stimulate mRNA translation, highlight 
uORF-mediated translational repression involving ribosome queuing, and 
critically evaluate recently described alternatives to the delayed reinitiation 
model for uORF-mediated regulation of the GCN4/ATF4 mRNAs.
