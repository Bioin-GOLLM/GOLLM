BACKGROUND: For many years fluconazole has been commonly used to treat Candida 
infections. However, the indiscriminate use of this antimycotic therapy has 
favored the emergence of resistant isolates. Mutations in the ERG11 gene have 
been described as one of the primary mechanisms of resistance in Candida 
species.
AIMS: In this study we investigated missense mutations in ERG11 genes of Candida 
albicans, Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis isolates previously evaluated 
by susceptibility testing to fluconazole.
METHODS: Screening for these mutations was performed on 19 Candida clinical 
isolates (eight C. albicans, five C. glabrata and six C. tropicalis) resistant 
and susceptible to fluconazole. The ERG11 gene was amplified by PCR with 
specific primers for each Candida species and analyzed by automated sequencing.
RESULTS: We identified 14 different missense mutations, five of which had not 
been described previously. Among them, a new mutation L321F was identified in a 
fluconazole resistant C. albicans isolate and it was analyzed by a theoretical 
three-dimensional structure of the ERG11p.
CONCLUSION: The L321F mutation in C. albicans ERG11 gene may be associated with 
fluconazole resistance.
