p63, more specifically its ΔNp63α isoform, plays essential roles in squamous 
cell carcinomas (SCCs), yet the mechanisms controlling its nuclear transport 
remain unknown. Nucleoporins (NUPs) are a family of proteins building nuclear 
pore complexes (NPC) and mediating nuclear transport across the nuclear 
envelope. Recent evidence suggests a cell type-specific function for certain 
NUPs; however, the significance of NUPs in SCC biology remains unknown. In this 
study, we show that nucleoporin 62 (NUP62) is highly expressed in stratified 
squamous epithelia and is further elevated in SCCs. Depletion of NUP62 inhibits 
proliferation and augments differentiation of SCC cells. The impaired ability to 
maintain the undifferentiated status is associated with defects in ΔNp63α 
nuclear transport. We further find that differentiation-inducible Rho kinase 
reduces the interaction between NUP62 and ΔNp63α by phosphorylation of 
phenylalanine-glycine regions of NUP62, attenuating ΔNp63α nuclear import. Our 
results characterize NUP62 as a gatekeeper for ΔNp63α and uncover its role in 
the control of cell fate through regulation of ΔNp63α nuclear transport in SCC.
