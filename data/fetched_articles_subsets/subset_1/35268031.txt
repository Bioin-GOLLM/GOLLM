The polymorphisms of fatty acid desaturase genes FADS1 and FADS2 have been 
associated with an increase in weight gain. We investigated FADS1 and FADS2 gene 
polymorphisms and the relation between ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acid plasma 
concentrations and gestational weight gain. A prospective cohort study of 199 
pregnant women was followed in Santo Antônio de Jesus, Brazil. Plasma levels of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were measured at baseline and gestational 
weight gain during the first, second, and third trimesters. Fatty acid 
recognition was carried out with the aid of gas chromatography. Single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using real-time PCR. Statistical 
analyses included Structural Equation Modelling. A direct effect of FADS1 and 
FADS2 gene polymorphisms on gestational weight was observed; however, only the 
SNP rs174575 (FADS2) showed a significant positive direct effect on weight over 
the course of the pregnancy (0.106; p = 0.016). In terms of the influence of 
SNPs on plasma levels of PUFAs, it was found that SNP rs174561 (FADS1) and SNP 
rs174575 (FADS2) showed direct adverse effects on plasma concentrations of ω-3 
(eicosapentaenoic acid and alpha-linoleic acid), and only SNP rs174575 had 
positive direct effects on plasma levels of ARA and the ARA/LA (arachidonic 
acid/linoleic acid) ratio, ω-6 products, while the SNP rs3834458 (FADS2) had an 
adverse effect on plasma concentrations of EPA, leading to its increase. 
Pregnant women who were heterozygous and homozygous for the minor allele of the 
SNP rs3834458 (FADS2), on the other hand, showed larger concentrations of series 
ω-3 substrates, which indicates a protective factor for women's health.
