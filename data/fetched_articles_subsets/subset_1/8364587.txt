Utilizing a heteroduplex method, we screened the dystrophin exon 43-45 region 
for point mutations, including small deletions and insertions. The method 
depends upon the formation of a heteroduplex between wild-type and mutant DNA 
PCR products. DNA specimens from one hundred and four DMD patients without 
detected deletions or duplications were multiplexed amplified for exons 43, 44, 
and 45. The PCR products were mixed with the PCR products from nonaffected 
controls, electrophoresed, and examined for the presence of altered mobility 
heteroduplex bands. An exon 44 nonsense mutation in two DMD brothers and a 
common intron 44 polymorphism were identified using this approach. Although the 
exon 44-45 region is a hotspot for deletion breakpoints, it does not appear to 
be prone to point mutations. The technique is extremely useful for screening 
several exons simultaneously and it allowed us to screen a large number of 
patients.
