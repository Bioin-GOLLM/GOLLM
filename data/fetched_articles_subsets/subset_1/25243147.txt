Focused ultrasound involving inertial cavitation has been shown to be an 
efficient method to induce thrombolysis without any pharmacological agent. 
However, further investigation of the mechanisms involved and further 
optimization of the process are still required. The present work aims at 
studying the relevance of a bifrequency excitation compared to a classical 
monofrequency excitation to achieve thrombolysis without any pharmacological 
agent. In vitro human blood clots were placed at the focus of a piezoelectric 
transducer. Efficiency of the thrombolysis was assessed by weighing each clot 
before and after sonication. The efficiencies of mono- (550 kHz) and bifrequency 
(535 and 565 kHz) excitations were compared for peak power ranging from 70 W to 
220 W. The thrombolysis efficiency appears to be correlated to the inertial 
cavitation activity quantified by passive acoustic listening. In the conditions 
of the experiment, the power needed to achieve 80% of thrombolysis with a 
monofrequency excitation is reduced by the half with a bifrequency excitation. 
The thermal effects of bifrequency and monofrequency excitations, studied using 
MR thermometry measurements in turkey muscle samples where no cavitation 
occurred, did not show any difference between both types of excitations when 
using the same power level.
