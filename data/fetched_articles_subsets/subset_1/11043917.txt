In the process of population screening for apo E gene polymorphism with the PCR 
and subsequent restriction analysis, we identified a female who demonstrated 
heterozygosity for an unusual restriction fragment caused by the loss of a CfoI 
restriction site. Sequence analysis of the apo E gene was performed and a 
carrier of the mutant allele with C --> T substitution at cDNA position 3817 was 
identified, which caused an Arg136 --> Cys change. The first-line relatives have 
been screened for this rare mutation with PCR and restriction analysis of PCR 
products. The complete lipoprotein parameters have been determined in the 
probands family. In the family, only one child had the same mutant allele as his 
mother had. The proband (7.49 mmol/l) with her siblings had hypercholesterolemia 
and a high body mass index (BMI 31.6 kg/m2). By contrast, her son had a normal 
lipid spectrum with normal BMI. We described the mutation apo E2* (Arg136 --> 
Cys) in a family with elevated lipid levels, but there was no confirmation of 
the connection between this mutation and type III hyperlipoproteinemia or 
hyperlipoproteinemia at all. In the case of this mutation, other factors (mainly 
genetic) are important for the development of lipid metabolism disorders.
