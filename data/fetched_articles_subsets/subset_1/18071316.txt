The tumor suppressor RASSF1A is inactivated in many human cancers and is 
implicated in regulation of microtubule stability, cell cycle progression and 
apoptosis. However, the precise mechanisms of RASSF1A action and their 
regulation remain unclear. Here we show that Skp2, an oncogenic subunit of the 
Skp1-Cul1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex, interacts with, ubiquitinates, and 
promotes the degradation of RASSF1A at the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. 
This Skp2-dependent destruction of RASSF1A requires phosphorylation of the 
latter on serine-203 by cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase 4. Interestingly, 
mutation of RASSF1A-phosphorylation site Ser(203) to alanine results in a delay 
in cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. Moreover, enforced expression of 
Skp2 abolishes the inhibitory effect of RASSF1A on cell proliferation. Finally, 
the delay in G1-S progression after Skp2 removal is normalized by depletion of 
RASSF1A. These findings suggest that the Skp2-mediated degradation of RASSF1A 
plays an important role in cell proliferation and survival.
