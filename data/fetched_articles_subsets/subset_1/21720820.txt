Although a large number of AroA enzymes (5-enopyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate 
synthase [EPSPS]) have been identified, cloned and tested for glyphosate 
resistance, only AroA variants derived from Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain CP4 
have been successfully used commercially. We have now used a polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)-based two-step DNA synthesis (PTDS) method to synthesize an aroA 
gene (aroA(H. orenii)) from Halothermothrix orenii H168 encoding a new EPSPS 
similar to AroA(A. tumefaciens CP4.) AroA(H. orenii) was then expressed in 
Escherichia coli and key kinetic values of the purified enzyme were determined. 
Kinetic analysis of AroA(H. orenii) indicated that the full-length enzyme 
exhibited increased tolerance to glyphosate compared with E. coli AroA(E. coli) 
while retaining a high affinity for the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate. 
Transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing aroA(H. orenii) were resistant to 15 mM 
glyphosate. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that residues Thr355Ser affected 
the affinity of AroA(H. orenii) for glyphosate, providing further evidence that 
specific amino acid residues are responsible for differences in enzymatic 
behavior among different AroA enzymes.
