DNA-encoded chemical library (DECL) synthesis must occur in aqueous media under 
conditions that preserve the integrity of the DNA encoding tag. While the 
identification of "DNA-compatible" reaction conditions is critical for the 
development of DECL designs that explore previously inaccessible chemical space, 
reports measuring such compatibility have been largely restricted to methods 
that do not faithfully capture the impact of reaction conditions on DNA fidelity 
in solution phase. Here we report a comprehensive methodology that uses soluble 
DNA substrates that exactly recapitulate DNA's exposure to the chemically 
reactive species of DECL synthesis. This approach includes the assessment of 
chemical fidelity (reaction yield and purity), encoding fidelity (ligation 
efficiency), and readability (DNA compatibility), revealing the fate of the DNA 
tag during DECL chemistry from a single platform.
