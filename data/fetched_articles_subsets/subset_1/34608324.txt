How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major 
unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend 
on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression 
prediction accuracy from DNA sequences through the use of a deep learning 
architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from 
long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement 
yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both 
natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively 
parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict 
enhancer-promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with 
methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these 
advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations 
and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution.
