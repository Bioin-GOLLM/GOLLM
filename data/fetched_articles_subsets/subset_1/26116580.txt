BACKGROUND: The therapeutic use of α-amidated peptides (e.g. calcitonin, 
glucagon-like peptide) has increased dramatically, but there are major 
impediments to wider use of such peptides. Larger peptides are expensive to 
synthesize, and short plasma half-lives frequently limit the clinical 
circumstances in which the peptides would be useful. Both problems are 
potentially solved by producing peptides as fusions with the Fc region of human 
immunoglobulin.
METHODS: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), peptide YY (PYY) and neuromedin U (NMU) 
were expressed and purified from stable CHO lines; since the α-amide group is 
essential for full biological potency of many peptides, Fc-fusion peptides were 
expressed in CHO lines stably expressing the α-amidating enzyme, peptidylglycine 
α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM: EC 1.14.17.3). Purified fusion proteins were 
analyzed intact and after HRV3C rhinovirus protease cleavage, at a site in the 
linker separating the Fc region from the peptide, by mass spectrometry and 
amide-specific immunoassays.
RESULTS: The Fc fusions were expressed at 1-2.5 μg/mg cell protein and secreted 
at 5-20% of cell content per hour, in a peptide-specific manner. CHO cells 
express measurable endogenous PAM activity, amidating 25% of Fc-PYY and almost 
90% of Fc-GLP1. Expression of exogenous PAM increased the level of peptide 
amidation to 50% of Fc-PYY and 95 % of Fc-NMU. The Fc-GLP1 fusions were 
10,000-fold less active than synthetic GLP1 in a cell-receptor cyclic AMP-based 
assay, as expected since the amino terminal of GLP1 is essential for full 
biological activity. The Fc-PYY fusions were 100-fold less active than PYY-NH2 
but 10-fold more active than non-amidated PYY-Gly.
CONCLUSIONS: This type of approach can be used for the production of stabilized 
α-amidated peptides aimed at clinical trials.
