Ena/VASP proteins and the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) regulate cell motility 
by virtue of their ability to independently promote actin polymerization. We 
demonstrate that Ena/VASP and the WRC control actin polymerization in a 
cooperative manner through the interaction of the Ena/VASP EVH1 domain with an 
extended proline rich motif in Abi. This interaction increases cell migration 
and enables VASP to cooperatively enhance WRC stimulation of Arp2/3 
complex-mediated actin assembly in vitro in the presence of Rac. Loss of this 
interaction in Drosophila macrophages results in defects in lamellipodia 
formation, cell spreading, and redistribution of Ena to the tips of 
filopodia-like extensions. Rescue experiments of abi mutants also reveals a 
physiological requirement for the Abi:Ena interaction in photoreceptor axon 
targeting and oogenesis. Our data demonstrate that the activities of Ena/VASP 
and the WRC are intimately linked to ensure optimal control of actin 
polymerization during cell migration and development.
