Objectives: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical application 
value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in central nervous system 
(CNS) infections. Methods: Both mNGS and routine examination of cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) samples from patients with CNS infections retrospectively analyzed 
the efficacy of mNGS in this cohort and were ultimately compared with a clinical 
diagnosis. Results: A total of 94 cases consistent with CNS infections were 
included in the analysis. The positive rate for mNGS is 60.6% (57/94), which is 
significantly higher than 20.2% (19/94; p < 0.01) detected using conventional 
methods. mNGS detected 21 pathogenic strains that could not be detected by 
routine testing. Routine tests were positive for two pathogens but negative for 
mNGS. The sensitivity and specificity of mNGS in the diagnosis of central 
nervous system infections were 89.5% and 44%, respectively, when compared with 
traditional tests. At discharge, 20 (21.3%) patients were cured, 55 (58.5%) 
patients showed improvements, five (5.3%) patients did not recover, and two 
(2.1%) patients died. Conclusion: mNGS has unique advantages in the diagnosis of 
central nervous system infections. mNGS tests can be performed when patients are 
clinically suspected of having a central nervous system infection but no 
pathogenic evidence.
