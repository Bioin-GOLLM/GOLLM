Despite recent interest in deep generative models for scaffold elaboration, 
their applicability to fragment-to-lead campaigns has so far been limited. This 
is primarily due to their inability to account for local protein structure or a 
user's design hypothesis. We propose a novel method for fragment elaboration, 
STRIFE, that overcomes these issues. STRIFE takes as input fragment hotspot maps 
(FHMs) extracted from a protein target and processes them to provide meaningful 
and interpretable structural information to its generative model, which in turn 
is able to rapidly generate elaborations with complementary pharmacophores to 
the protein. In a large-scale evaluation, STRIFE outperforms existing, 
structure-unaware, fragment elaboration methods in proposing highly 
ligand-efficient elaborations. In addition to automatically extracting 
pharmacophoric information from a protein target's FHM, STRIFE optionally allows 
the user to specify their own design hypotheses.
