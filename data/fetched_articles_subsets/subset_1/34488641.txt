BACKGROUND: Evidence on specific interventions to improve diabetes control in 
primary care is available, but this evidence is not always well-implemented. The 
concept of "mindlines" has been proposed to explain how clinicians integrate 
evidence using specifics of their practices and patients to produce 
knowledge-in-practice-in-context. The goal of this pilot study was to 
operationalize this concept by creating a venue for clinician-staff interaction 
concerning evidence. The research team attempted to hold "mindlines"-producing 
conversations in primary care practices about evidence to improve diabetes 
control.
METHODS: Each of four primary care practices in a single health system held 
practice-wide conversations about a simple diabetes intervention model over a 
provided lunch. The conversations were relatively informal and encouraged 
participation from all. The research team recorded the conversations and took 
field notes. The team analyzed the data using a framework adapted from the 
"mindlines" research and noted additional emergent themes.
RESULTS: While most of the conversation concerned barriers to implementation of 
the simple diabetes intervention model, there were examples of practices 
adopting and adapting the evidence to suit their own needs and context. 
Performance metrics regarding diabetes control for the four practices improved 
after the intervention.
CONCLUSION: It appears that the type of conversations that "mindlines" research 
describes can be generated with facilitation around evidence, but further 
research is required to better understand the limitations and impact of this 
intervention.
