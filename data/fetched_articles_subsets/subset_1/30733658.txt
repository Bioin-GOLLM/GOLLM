A boy and his father with severe short stature, progressively evolving body 
asymmetry, and skeletal abnormalities are presented. A next-generation 
sequencing exome study was performed, and the patient was found heterozygous for 
the c.1609G>A (p.Gly537Ser) mutation in the COL2A1 gene. This mutation is 
considered a pathogenic variant and has been previously registered in the Human 
Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) in association with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia 
(accession: CM052184). It has been described in a patient as a sporadic case and 
resulted in a severe phenotype. Segregation studies, in order to determine the 
inheritance pattern, identified the same mutation in our patient's father. The 
variant was transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. In conclusion, we 
describe a patient with hereditary spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, 
caused by a c.1609G_A (p.Gly537Ser) mutation in the COL2A1 gene, which resulted 
in a milder phenotype.
