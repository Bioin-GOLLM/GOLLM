We report a 13-year-old Indian boy with nephrotic syndrome caused by renal AA 
amyloidosis. Workup of the AA amyloidosis revealed chronic hepatitis B. Laser 
microdissection of the Congo-red-positive glomeruli and vessels followed by 
liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of 
serum amyloid A (SAA) protein and ruled out hereditary and familial amyloidosis. 
Furthermore, mass spectrometry also detected a variant of SAA protein (SAA 
W71R).
