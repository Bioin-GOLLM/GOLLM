Adverse environmental conditions faced by an individual early during its life, 
such as gestational hypoxia, can have a profound influence on the risk of 
diseases, such as neurological disorders, in later life. Clinical and 
preclinical studies suggest that epigenetic programming of gene expression 
patterns in response to maternal stress have a crucial role in the fetal origins 
of neurological diseases. Herein, we summarize recent studies regarding the role 
of epigenetic mechanisms in the developmental programming of neurological 
diseases in offspring, primarily focusing on DNA methylation/demethylation and 
miRNAs. Such information could increase our understanding of the fetal origins 
of adult diseases and help develop effective prevention and intervention against 
neurological diseases.
