Downy mildew (DM), caused by P. cubensis, is harmful to cucurbits including 
luffa, with increased shortcomings associated with its control through cultural 
practices, chemical fungicides, and resistant cultivars; there is a prompt need 
for an effective, eco-friendly, economical, and safe biocontrol approach. 
Current research is therefore dealt with the biocontrol of luffa DM1 through the 
endophytic fungi (EF) consortium. Results revealed that T. harzianum (ThM9) and 
T. virens (TvA1) showed pathogen-dependent inducible metabolic production of 
squalene and gliotoxins by higher gene expression induction of SQS1/ERG9 
(squalene synthase) and GliP (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase). Gene expression 
of lytic enzymes of EF was also induced with subsequently higher enzyme 
activities upon confrontation with P. cubensis. EF-inoculated luffa seeds showed 
efficient germination with enhanced growth potential and vigor of seedlings. 
EF-inoculated plants showed an increased level of growth-promoting hormone GA 
with higher gene expression of GA2OX8. EF-pre-inoculated seedlings were 
resistant to DM and showed an increased GSH content and antioxidant enzyme 
activities (SOD, CAT, POD). The level of MDA, H2O2, REL, and disease severity 
was reduced by EF. ACC, JA, ABA, and SA were overproduced along with higher gene 
expression of LOX, ERF, NCED2, and PAL. Expression of defense-marker genes (PPO, 
CAT2, SOD, APX, PER5, LOX, NBS-LRR, PSY, CAS, Ubi, MLP43) was also modulated in 
EF-inoculated infected plants. Current research supported the use of EF 
inoculation to effectively escalate the systemic immunity against DM 
corresponding to the significant promotion of induced systemic resistance (ISR) 
and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) responses through initiating the defense 
mechanism by SA, ABA, ET, and JA biosynthesis and signaling pathways in luffa.
