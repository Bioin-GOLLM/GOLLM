BACKGROUND: Corpus callosum agenesis (ACC) is one of the most frequent Central 
Nervous System (CNS) malformations. However, genetics underlying isolated forms 
is still poorly recognized. Here, we report on two female familial cases with 
partial ACC. The proband shows isolated partial ACC and a mild 
neurodevelopmental phenotype. A fetus from a previous interrupted pregnancy 
exhibited a complex phenotype including partial ACC and the occurrence of a de 
novo 17q12 microduplication, which was interpreted as probably disease-causing.
METHODS: A trio-based clinical exome sequencing (CES) was performed.
RESULTS: Clinical exome sequencing data analysis led to identifying a 
heterozygous nonsense variant (NM_139058.3:c.922G>T; NP_620689.1:p.Glu308Ter) in 
the aristaless related homeobox gene (ARX) in the proband, with a putative de 
novo occurrence, producing a hypothetical protein lacking two essential domains. 
Sanger analysis confirmed the wild-type status of both parents in different 
tissues, and disclosed the occurrence of the nonsense variant in the fetus of 
the interrupted pregnancy, suggesting a formerly unrecognized contribution of 
the ARX mutation to the fetus' phenotype and gonadal or gonadosomatic mosaicism 
in one of the parents.
CONCLUSION: This study describes the phenotype associated with a heterozygous 
loss of function variant in ARX. Moreover, it highlights the importance of 
investigating both chromosomal and genetic contributions in cases of complex 
syndromic phenotypes involving CNS.
