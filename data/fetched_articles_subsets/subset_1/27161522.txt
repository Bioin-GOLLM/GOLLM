Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), but the mechanism by which it causes cognitive decline is unclear. In 
knockin (KI) mice, human apoE4 causes age-dependent learning and memory 
impairments and degeneration of GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampal 
dentate gyrus. Here we report two functional apoE4-KI phenotypes involving 
sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), hippocampal network events critical for memory 
processes. Aged apoE4-KI mice had fewer SWRs than apoE3-KI mice and 
significantly reduced slow gamma activity during SWRs. Elimination of apoE4 in 
GABAergic interneurons, which prevents learning and memory impairments, rescued 
SWR-associated slow gamma activity but not SWR abundance in aged mice. SWR 
abundance was reduced similarly in young and aged apoE4-KI mice; however, the 
full SWR-associated slow gamma deficit emerged only in aged apoE4-KI mice. These 
results suggest that progressive decline of interneuron-enabled slow gamma 
activity during SWRs critically contributes to apoE4-mediated learning and 
memory impairments. VIDEO ABSTRACT.
