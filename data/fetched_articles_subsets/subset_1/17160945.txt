OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of the A to G variant at nucleotide 12026 
(mt12026) of the mitochondrial NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) gene in 
familial diabetes mellitus in Chinese population.
METHODS: The authors screened 770 randomly selected, unrelated probands of 
diabetic pedigrees, and 309 controls with normal glucose tolerance for the 
variant by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(PCR-RFLP) technique and PCR-direct-sequencing.
RESULTS: The mt12026 A --> G variant was detected in 28 diabetic patients 
(3.63%) and 9 controls (2.91%). The frequency of the variant mt12026 A --> G was 
not statistically different between diabetic patients and controls. Moreover, 
clinical characteristics such as age, body mass index (BMI), and insulin 
resistant index were not different between diabetic patients with and without 
the mt12026 mutation.
CONCLUSION: The mt12026 A --> G variant is a mitochondrial gene polymorphism in 
Chinese population, and it is unlikely that the mutation is in itself the cause 
of diabetes.
