BACKGROUND: Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) has been almost exclusively 
recognized as a critical enzyme in gluconeogenesis, especially in the liver and 
kidney. Accumulating evidence has shown that the enhanced activity of PCK leads 
to increased glucose output and exacerbation of diabetes, whereas the defects of 
PCK result in lethal hypoglycemia. Genetic mutations or polymorphisms are 
reported to be related to the onset and progression of diabetes in humans.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: Recent studies revealed that the PCK pathway is more complex 
than just gluconeogenesis, depending on the health or disease condition. 
Dysregulation of PCK may contribute to the development of obesity, cardiac 
hypertrophy, stroke, and cancer. Moreover, a regulatory network with multiple 
layers, from epigenetic regulation, transcription regulation, to 
posttranscription regulation, precisely tunes the expression of PCK. Deciphering 
the molecular basis that regulates PCK may pave the way for developing practical 
strategies to treat metabolic dysfunction.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we summarize the metabolic and non-metabolic 
roles of the PCK enzyme in cells, especially beyond gluconeogenesis. We 
highlight the distinct functions of PCK isoforms (PCK1 and PCK2), depict a 
detailed network regulating PCK's expression, and discuss its clinical 
relevance. We also discuss the therapeutic potential targeting PCK and the 
future direction that is highly in need to better understand PCK-mediated 
signaling under diverse conditions.
