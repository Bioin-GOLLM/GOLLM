The title compound, C(23)H(30)ClN(5)O(3) (2+)·2Cl(-)·0.5H(2)O, was synthesized 
by N-alkyl-ation of 
1-({[5-(4-chloro-phen-yl)-2-furan-yl]methyl-ene}amino)-2,4-imidazolidinedione 
with 1-bromo-4-chloro-butane, and N-methyl-piperazine. In the crystal, the 
cations, anions and water mol-ecules are linked by O-H⋯Cl and N-H⋯Cl hydrogen 
bonds.
