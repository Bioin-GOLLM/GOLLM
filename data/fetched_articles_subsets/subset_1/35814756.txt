Radiomics involves high-throughput extraction and analysis of quantitative 
information from medical images. Since it was proposed in 2012, there are some 
publications on the application of radiomics for (1) predicting recurrent acute 
pancreatitis (RAP), clinical severity of acute pancreatitis (AP), and 
extrapancreatic necrosis in AP; (2) differentiating mass-forming chronic 
pancreatitis (MFCP) from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), focal 
autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) from PDAC, and functional abdominal pain 
(functional gastrointestinal diseases) from RAP and chronic pancreatitis (CP); 
and (3) identifying CP and normal pancreas, and CP risk factors and 
complications. In this review, we aim to systematically summarize the 
applications and progress of radiomics in pancreatitis and it associated 
situations, so as to provide reference for related research.
