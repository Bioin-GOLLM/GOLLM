Tissue-like cultured meats of some livestock have successfully been established 
by different approaches. However, the production of a structure similar to fish 
fillets is still challenging. Here, we develop tissue-like cultured fish fillets 
by assembly of large yellow croaker muscle fibers and adipocytes with 3D-printed 
gel. Inhibition of Tgf-β and Notch signals significantly promoted myogenic 
differentiation of piscine satellite cells (PSCs). The mixture of fish gelatin 
and sodium alginate combined with a p53 inhibitor and a Yap activator supported 
PSC viability and proliferation. Based on the texture of fish muscle tissue, a 
3D scaffold was constructed by gelatin-based gel mixed with PSCs. After 
proliferation and differentiation, the muscle scaffold was filled with cultured 
piscine adipocytes. Finally, tissue-like fish fillets with 20 × 12 × 4 mm were 
formed, consisting of 5.67 × 107 muscles and 4.02 × 107 adipocytes. The 
biomanufacture of tissue-like cultured fish fillet here could be a promising 
technology to customize meat production with high fidelity.
