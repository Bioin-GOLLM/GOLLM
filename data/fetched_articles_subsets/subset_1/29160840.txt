We report the heterologous expression and molecular characterization of the 
first extremely halophilic alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) from the archaeon 
Haloquadratum walsbyi. A 2349 bp region (Hqrw_2071) from the Hqr. walsbyi C23 
annotated genome was PCR-amplified and the resulting amplicon ligated into 
plasmid pET28b(+), expressed in E. coli Rosetta cells, and the resulting protein 
purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein showed an 
estimated molecular mass of 87 kDa, consistent with the expected value of the 
annotated protein, and an optimal activity for the hydrolysis of α-PNPG was 
detected at 40 °C, and at pH 6.0. Enzyme activity values were the highest in the 
presence of 3 M NaCl or 3-4 M KCl. However, specific activity values were 
two-fold higher in the presence of 3-4 M KCl when compared to NaCl suggesting a 
cytoplasmic localization. Phylogenetic analyses, with respect to other 
alpha-glucosidases from members of the class Halobacteria, showed that the Hqr. 
walsbyi MalH was most similar (up to 41%) to alpha-glucosidases and 
alpha-xylosidases of Halorubrum. Moreover, computational analyses for the 
detection of functional domains, active and catalytic sites, as well as 3D 
structural predictions revealed a close relationship with an E. coli YicI-like 
alpha-xylosidase of the GH31 family. However, the purified enzyme did not show 
alpha-xylosidase activity. This narrower substrate range indicates a discrepancy 
with annotations from different databases and the possibility of specific 
substrate adaptations of halophilic glucosidases due to high salinity. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report on the characterization of an 
alpha-glucosidase from the halophilic Archaea, which could serve as a new model 
to gain insights into carbon metabolism in this understudied microbial group.
