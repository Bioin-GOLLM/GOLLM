Citrullination, the deimination of peptidylarginine residues into 
peptidylcitrulline, has been implicated in the etiology of several diseases. In 
multiple sclerosis, citrullination is thought to be a major driver of pathology 
through hypercitrullination and destabilization of myelin. As such, inhibition 
of citrullination has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy for MS. Here, in 
contrast, we show that citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) 
contributes to normal oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination, and motor 
function. We identify several targets for PAD2, including myelin and 
chromatin-related proteins, implicating PAD2 in epigenomic regulation. 
Accordingly, we observe that PAD2 inhibition and its knockdown affect chromatin 
accessibility and prevent the upregulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation 
genes. Moreover, mice lacking PAD2 display motor dysfunction and a decreased 
number of myelinated axons in the corpus callosum. We conclude that 
citrullination contributes to proper oligodendrocyte lineage progression and 
myelination.
