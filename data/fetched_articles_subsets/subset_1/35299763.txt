BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy generally causes serious diarrhea and oral mucositis in 
cancer patients, and subsequently affects treatment. Oral administration of 
probiotics provides a therapeutic choice to address these limitations. This 
study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of 
oral probiotic use in the management of the chemotherapy-induced adverse 
reactions, and to summarize the mechanisms underlying the action.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science from 
the start of the study to its completion on Dec. 31, 2021. Risk of bias was 
assessed using Cochrane Collaboration's Tool. Statistical analysis of the 
acquired data was performed via the RevMan and the Stata Statistical Software. 
The protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of 
Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020220650).
RESULTS: Twelve randomized controlled trials including 1,013 patients were 
recruited and analyzed via the standard procedure of meta-analysis. In contrast 
to the control group, orally taking probiotics significantly decreased the risk 
of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (≥ 1 grade) (RR = 0.70; 95% Cl: 0.56, 0.88; P = 
0.002) and oral mucositis (≥ 1 grade) (RR: 0.84; 95% Cl: 0.78, 0.91; P < 
0.00001) at all grades. Further analysis found that severe diarrhea (≥ 2 grades) 
(RR: 0.50; 95% Cl: 0.32, 0.78; P = 0.002) and severe oral mucositis also 
significantly declined (≥ 3 grades) (RR: 0.66; 95% Cl: 0.55, 0.79; P < 0.00001) 
after oral probiotic use. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of probiotics 
displayed statistically significant only in Asian patients. Importantly, the 
more species of bacteria they took, the lower the incidences of the adverse 
reactions occurred. We used Egger's test P value to confirm that there is no 
publication bias.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrated that orally administrated 
probiotics has a potential to decrease chemotherapy-induced diarrhea and oral 
mucositis incidences. However, the efficacy of oral probiotic use against the 
adverse reactions needs to be further verified through more clinical trials, and 
the species and number of probiotics have to be optimized and standardized prior 
to clinical applications.
