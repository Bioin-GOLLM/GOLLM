Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease in need of 
prognostic markers to address therapeutic choices. We have previously shown that 
alternative splicing of the actin regulator, hMENA, generates hMENA11a, and 
hMENAΔv6 isoforms with opposite roles in cell invasion. We examined the 
expression pattern of hMENA isoforms by immunohistochemistry, using anti-pan 
hMENA and specific anti-hMENA11a antibodies, in 285 PDACs, 15 PanINs, 10 
pancreatitis, and normal pancreas. Pan hMENA immunostaining, absent in normal 
pancreas and low-grade PanINs, was weak in PanIN-3 and had higher levels in 
virtually all PDACs with 64% of cases showing strong staining. Conversely, the 
anti-invasive hMENA11a isoform only showed strong staining in 26% of PDAC. The 
absence of hMENA11a in a subset (34%) of pan-hMENA-positive tumors significantly 
correlated with poor outcome. The functional effects of hMENA isoforms were 
analyzed by loss and gain of function experiments in TGF-β1-treated PDAC cell 
lines. hMENA11a knock-down in PDAC cell lines affected cell-cell adhesion but 
not invasion. TGF-β1 cooperated with β-catenin signaling to upregulate hMENA and 
hMENAΔv6 expression but not hMENA11a In the absence of hMENA11a, the 
hMENA/hMENAΔv6 up-regulation is crucial for SMAD2-mediated TGF-β1 signaling and 
TGF-β1-induced EMT. Since the hMENA isoform expression pattern correlates with 
patient outcome, the data suggest that hMENA splicing and related pathways are 
novel key players in pancreatic tumor microenvironment and may represent 
promising targets for the development of new prognostic and therapeutic tools in 
PDAC.
