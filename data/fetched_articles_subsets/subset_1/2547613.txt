Secretory granules and endosomes show saltatory movement biased to the 
anterograde and retrograde directions, respectively, along microtubules in AtT20 
cells.

AtT20 (clone D16V) cells develop long neurite-like processes in the growth cones 
of which secretory granules containing ACTH accumulate. These secretory granules 
have an acidic pH. Using acridine orange as a vital stain for acidic organelles, 
in combination with video-enhanced fluorescence microscopy, and subsequent 
immunolabeling with rabbit antibodies against ACTH, we have shown that these 
secretory granules move by saltations along the processes. During saltations 
velocities of 3 to 5 microns/s are achieved. The majority of the secretory 
granules move in the anterograde direction but some move retrogradely. The 
growth cones and processes are the site of extensive endocytosis. Using Lucifer 
Yellow as a vital stain we have shown that most endosomes move by saltations 
retrogradely. Movement of both secretory granules and endosomes is dependent 
upon microtubules. Individual secretory granules or endosomes never reverse the 
direction of their movement as they traverse the processes. Neutralization of 
the lumen of these acidic organelles with NH4Cl does not inhibit their movement 
or change its direction.
