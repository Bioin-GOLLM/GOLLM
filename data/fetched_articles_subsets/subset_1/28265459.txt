BACKGROUND: Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors can improve 
hyperkinetic movements, and are effective treatment options for chorea of 
Huntington disease (HD). Tetrabenazine was assessed for treating chorea in the 
TETRA-HD trial, and while efficacious, there are tolerability concerns possibly 
due to its pharmacokinetic properties. Deutetrabenazine is a novel VMAT2 
inhibitor that contains deuterium, which extends active metabolite half-lives 
and minimizes drug concentration fluctuations. In the First-HD trial, 
deutetrabenazine was efficacious in treating chorea and was generally well 
tolerated. In the absence of a head-to-head trial, we performed an indirect 
treatment comparison (ITC) of the tolerability of deutetrabenazine and 
tetrabenazine for the treatment of HD-associated chorea, as observed in the 
First-HD and TETRA-HD trials, using well-established comparison methods.
METHODS: Data from the Phase III, 12-week, parallel-group, clinical trials 
First-HD (N = 90) and TETRA-HD (N = 84) were used to conduct an ITC of the 
tolerability of deutetrabenazine versus tetrabenazine using two anchor-based 
methods: Bucher comparison for unadjusted ITCs, and matching indirect comparison 
for adjusted ITCs. Overall adverse events (AEs; mild, moderate, and severe), 
serious AEs, specific AEs occurring in ≥10% of patients, and discontinuations 
(all-cause and AE-related) were included in the analysis. The risk differences 
of these outcomes for deutetrabenazine and tetrabenazine were estimated by 
subtracting the applicable placebo-adjusted risk in First-HD from that of 
TETRA-HD. Sensitivity analyses were performed to address differences between 
trials, and p-values were obtained from z-tests.
RESULTS: Compared with tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine was associated with a 
significantly lower risk of moderate to severe AEs and neuropsychiatric AEs 
including agitation, akathisia, depression, depression/agitated depression, 
drowsiness/somnolence, insomnia, and parkinsonism in both adjusted and 
unadjusted analyses (p < 0.05 for each). Deutetrabenazine had a significantly 
lower rate of dose reduction or dose reduction/suspension in the unadjusted and 
adjusted analyses (p < 0.001 for each). Deutetrabenazine resulted in numerically 
more mild AEs, such as diarrhea and coughing; however, these results were not 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: This indirect treatment comparison demonstrates that for the 
treatment of HD chorea, deutetrabenazine has a favorable tolerability profile 
compared to tetrabenazine.
