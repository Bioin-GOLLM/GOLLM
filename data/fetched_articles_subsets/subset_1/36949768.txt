BACKGROUND: Antithrombin deficiency is a rare but severe disorder leading to 
high risk of thrombosis. The current clinical care pathway relies on activity 
tests, which only provide overall functional information on the in vitro 
activity of antithrombin. However, antithrombin exists in many different forms, 
also known as proteoforms, with varying clinical phenotypes. Precision 
diagnostics, facilitated by mass spectrometry, provides a strategy to improve 
patient diagnostics by molecular characterization.
OBJECTIVES: To develop and analytically validate a mass spectrometry-based test 
for molecular characterization of antithrombin.
METHODS: The test was analytically validated based on predefined analytical 
performance specifications. The validation covered imprecision, carryover, 
linearity, stability, analytical specificity, a provisional reference interval, 
and an explorative method comparison.
RESULTS: The test passed the predefined analytical performance specifications 
with a mean within-laboratory imprecision of 5.9%, linearity between 0.08 and 
2.58 μmol/L, and a provisional reference interval of 1.07 to 1.49 μmol/L. When 
measuring samples with a suspected quantitative deficiency, the test showed a 
good correlation with a commercial activity test (Pearson r = 0.88).
CONCLUSION: The test passed the validation, and we now envision the use of the 
test for exploration of the clinical relevance of specific antithrombin 
proteoforms. Puzzling cases of antithrombin deficiency, for instance, due to 
ambiguous activity results or an atypical clinical presentation, can be 
investigated by the LC-MRM mass spectrometry test serving as an add-on to the 
activity test and providing a molecular diagnosis. Clinical studies are planned 
to investigate the potential of the test to improve antithrombin diagnostics. 
Furthermore, the molecular information gained using the test may aid in 
establishing better risk stratification and a basis for personalized medicine.
