Cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death and morbidity, is regulated, 
among various factors, by inflammation. The level of the metabolite adenosine is 
augmented under stress, including inflammatory, hypoxic, or injurious events. 
Adenosine has been shown to affect various physiological and pathological 
processes, largely through 1 or more of its 4 types of receptors: the A1 and A3 
adenylyl cyclase inhibitory receptors and the A2A and A2B adenylyl cyclase 
stimulatory receptors. This article focuses on reviewing common and distinct 
effects of the 2 A2-type adenosine receptors on vascular disease and the 
mechanisms involved. Understanding the pathogenesis of vascular disease mediated 
by these receptors is important to the development of therapeutics and to the 
prevention and management of disease.
