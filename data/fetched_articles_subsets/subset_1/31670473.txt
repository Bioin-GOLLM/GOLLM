Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are RNA binding proteins, 
which aid in maturation, stabilization, and transport of mRNA. They have a 
significant role in cellular nucleic acid metabolism. The hnRNPs alter gene 
expression and are linked to various neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. 
Previously, six unrelated girls with developmental delay, intellectual 
disability, and hypotonia were found to have de novo heterozygous pathogenic 
missense variants in HNRNPH2, located on the X chromosome. A gain-of-function 
effect was proposed for the variant and it was thought to be lethal in males as 
no surviving males were identified. We describe a family with two affected 
siblings, one male and one female, with a known pathogenic variant in HNRNPH2, 
possibly due to maternal germline mosaicism.
