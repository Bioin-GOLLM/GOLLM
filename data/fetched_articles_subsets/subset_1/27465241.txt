A carbapenem-resistant Citrobacter freundii strain WCHCF65 was recovered from 
hospital sewage and was characterized by genome sequencing and conjugation 
experiments. The strain carried nine genes encoding Î²-lactamases including two 
carbapenemase genes, blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2. blaNDM-1 was carried on an IncX3 
plasmid, which was identical to a plasmid found in a local Escherichia coli, 
suggesting interspecies horizontal transfer. blaKPC-2 was bracketed by two 
copies of insertion sequence ISKpn19, which could form a composite transposon 
with the potential to mobilize blaKPC-2, on a new type of plasmid. The 
coexistence of blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2 conferred higher levels of resistance to 
carbapenems compared with blaNDM-1 or blaKPC-2 alone. The coexistence of these 
carbapenemase genes, on two different plasmids, in one strain may allow new 
genetic platforms to be generated to mediate their spread.
