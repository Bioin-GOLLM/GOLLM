INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is 
often accompanied by lung cancer. Among the genes that may play a role in the 
occurrence of COPD and lung cancer are those encoding the proteolytic enzymes, 
such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors. The 
objective of this study was to find MMPs-associated markers useful in the 
identification of COPD subjects with increased susceptibility to developing lung 
cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the frequency of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms in genes coding for matrix proteinases (MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, 
MMP12) as well as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP1) in two groups 
of subjects: COPD patients (54 subjects) and COPD patients diagnosed for lung 
cancer occurrence (53 subjects).The levels of the respective proteins in blood 
serum were also analyzed.
RESULTS: The frequencies of 2 genotypes, MMP3 rs3025058 and MMP3 rs678815, were 
significantly different between the studied groups. In both cases, more 
heterozygotes and less homozygotes (both types) were observed in the COPD group 
than in the COPD + cancer group. A significantly higher TIMP1 level in blood 
serum was observed in the COPD + cancer group than in the COPD group. There were 
no statistically significant differences in MMPs blood levels between the 
studied groups. In addition, no genotype-associated differences in TIMP1 or MMPs 
blood levels were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Homozygocity for MMP3 rs3025058 and rs678815 polymorphisms is a 
potential marker of enhanced susceptibility to lung cancer development among 
COPD subjects.
