BACKGROUND: The forkhead box transcription factor FOXQ1 has been shown to be 
upregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and metastatic breast cancer and involved 
in tumor development, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and chemoresistance. 
Yet, its transcriptional regulation is still unknown.
METHODS: FOXQ1 mRNA and protein expression were analysed in a panel of CRC cell 
lines, and laser micro-dissected human biopsy samples by qRT-PCR, microarray 
GeneChipÂ® U133 Plus 2.0 and western blots. FOXQ1 regulation was assayed by 
chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays.
RESULTS: FOXQ1 was robustly induced in CRC compared to other tumors, but had no 
predictive value with regards to grade, metastasis and survival in CRC. 
Prototype-based gene coexpression and gene set enrichment analysis showed a 
significant association between FOXQ1 and the Wnt pathway in tumors and cancer 
cell lines from different tissues. In vitro experiments confirmed, on a 
molecular level, FOXQ1 as a direct Wnt target. Analysis of known Wnt targets 
identified FOXQ1 as the most suitable marker for canonical Wnt activation across 
a wide panel of cell lines derived from different tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that FOXQ1 is one of the most over-expressed genes in 
CRC and a direct target of the canonical Wnt pathway. It is a potential new 
marker for detection of early CRC and Wnt activation in tumors of different 
origins.
