The naked mole-rat (NMR) is the longest-lived rodent and possesses several 
exceptional traits: marked cancer resistance, negligible senescence, prolonged 
genomic integrity, pronounced proteostasis, and a sustained health span. The 
underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these extraordinary 
attributes are currently under investigation to gain insights that may 
conceivably promote and extend human health span and lifespan. The 
ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal systems play a vital role in 
eliminating cellular detritus to maintain proteostasis and have been previously 
shown to be more robust in NMRs when compared with shorter-lived rodents. Using 
a 2-D PAGE proteomics approach, differential expression and phosphorylation 
levels of proteins involved in proteostasis networks were evaluated in the 
brains of NMRs in an age-dependent manner. We identified 9 proteins with 
significantly altered levels and/or phosphorylation states that have key roles 
involved in proteostasis networks. To further investigate the possible role that 
autophagy may play in maintaining cellular proteostasis, we examined aspects of 
the PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis as well as levels of 
Beclin-1, LC3-I, and LC3-II in the brain of the NMR as a function of age. 
Together, these results show that NMRs maintain high levels of autophagy 
throughout the majority of their lifespan and may contribute to the 
extraordinary health span of these rodents. The potential of augmenting human 
health span via activating the proteostasis network will require further 
studies.
