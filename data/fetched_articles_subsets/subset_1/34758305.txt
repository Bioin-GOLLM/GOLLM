The anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) protein belongs to the 
pro-survival BCL2 family and is frequently amplified or elevated in human 
cancers. MCL1 is highly unstable, with its stability being regulated by 
phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Here, we identify acetylation as another 
critical post-translational modification regulating MCL1 protein stability. We 
demonstrate that the lysine acetyltransferase p300 targets MCL1 at K40 for 
acetylation, which is counteracted by the deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). 
Mechanistically, acetylation enhances MCL1 interaction with USP9X, resulting in 
deubiquitination and subsequent MCL1 stabilization. Therefore, ectopic 
expression of acetylation-mimetic MCL1 promotes apoptosis evasion of cancer 
cells, enhances colony formation potential, and facilitates xenografted tumor 
progression. We further demonstrate that elevated MCL1 acetylation sensitizes 
multiple cancer cells to pharmacological inhibition of USP9X. These findings 
reveal that acetylation of MCL1 is a critical post-translational modification 
enhancing its oncogenic function and provide a rationale for developing 
innovative therapeutic strategies for MCL1-dependent tumors.
