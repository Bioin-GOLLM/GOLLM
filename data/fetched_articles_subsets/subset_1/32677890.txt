BACKGROUND: Marek's disease (MD) is a highly neoplastic disease primarily 
affecting chickens, and remains as a chronic infectious disease that threatens 
the poultry industry. Copy number variation (CNV) has been examined in many 
species and is recognized as a major source of genetic variation that directly 
contributes to phenotypic variation such as resistance to infectious diseases. 
Two highly inbred chicken lines, 63 (MD-resistant) and 72 (MD-susceptible), as 
well as their F1 generation and six recombinant congenic strains (RCSs) with 
varied susceptibility to MD, are considered as ideal models to identify the 
complex mechanisms of genetic and molecular resistance to MD.
RESULTS: In the present study, to unravel the potential genetic mechanisms 
underlying resistance to MD, we performed a genome-wide CNV detection using next 
generation sequencing on the inbred chicken lines with the assistance of 
CNVnator. As a result, a total of 1649 CNV regions (CNVRs) were successfully 
identified after merging all the nine datasets, of which 90 CNVRs were 
overlapped across all the chicken lines. Within these shared regions, 1360 
harbored genes were identified. In addition, 55 and 44 CNVRs with 62 and 57 
harbored genes were specifically identified in line 63 and 72, respectively. 
Bioinformatics analysis showed that the nearby genes were significantly enriched 
in 36 GO terms and 6 KEGG pathways including JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Ten 
CNVRs (nine deletions and one duplication) involved in 10 disease-related genes 
were selected for validation by using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), all of 
which were successfully confirmed. Finally, qPCR was also used to validate two 
deletion events in line 72 that were definitely normal in line 63. One 
high-confidence gene, IRF2 was identified as the most promising candidate gene 
underlying resistance and susceptibility to MD in view of its function and 
overlaps with data from previous study.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide valuable insights for understanding the 
genetic mechanism of resistance to MD and the identified gene and pathway could 
be considered as the subject of further functional characterization.
