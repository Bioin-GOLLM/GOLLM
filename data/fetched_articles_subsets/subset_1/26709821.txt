BACKGROUND: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a frequent and lethal autosomal recessive 
disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the Cystic Fibrosis 
Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR). Patients with CF suffer from chronic 
infections and severe inflammation, which lead to progressive pulmonary and gut 
diseases. Recently, an expanding body of evidence has suggested that iron 
homeostasis was abnormal in CF with, in particular, systemic iron deficiency and 
iron sequestration in the epithelium airway. The molecular mechanisms 
responsible for iron dysregulation and the relationship with inflammation in CF 
are unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the impact of CFTR deficiency on systemic and 
tissue iron homeostasis as well as inflammation in wildtype and CFTR knockout 
(KO) mice. First, in contrast to the systemic and intestinal inflammation we 
observed in the CFTR KO mice, we reported the absence of lung phenotype with 
regards to both inflammation and iron status. Second, we showed a significant 
decrease of plasma ferritin levels in the KO mice, as in CF patients, likely 
caused by a decrease in spleen ferritin levels. However, we measured unchanged 
plasma iron levels in the KO mice that may be explained by increased intestinal 
iron absorption.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that in CF, the lung do not predominantly 
contributes to the systemic ferritin deficiency and we propose the spleen as the 
major organ responsible for hypoferritinemia in the KO mouse. These results 
should provide a better understanding of iron dysregulation in CF patients where 
treating or not iron deficiency remains a challenging question.
