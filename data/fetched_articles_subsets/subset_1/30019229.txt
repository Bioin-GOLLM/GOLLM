PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are closely linked 
metabolic diseases. Most individuals with T2D are overweight or obese, which 
raises their cardiovascular risk. The etiology of both diseases is multifaceted, 
thus requiring a multidisciplinary approach to control them. This review 
describes the most effective multidisciplinary approach to weight management in 
patients with T2D in real-world clinical practice.
RECENT FINDINGS: Weight management programs in real-world clinical settings lead 
to long-term weight loss for up to 5Â years. Multidisciplinary approach to manage 
obesity and T2D through weight reduction is feasible in real-world clinical 
practice and is recommended as part of the treatment plan for patients with T2D 
who are overweight or obese. Recent data demonstrates that multidisciplinary 
approach to weight management in patients with T2D results in long-term weight 
loss and is associated with improved cardiovascular risk factors.
