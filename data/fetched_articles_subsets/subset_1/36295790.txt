O-GlcNAcylation is an atypical, dynamic and reversible O-glycosylation that is 
critical and abundant in metazoan. O-GlcNAcylation coordinates and receives 
various signaling inputs such as nutrients and stresses, thus spatiotemporally 
regulating the activity, stability, localization and interaction of target 
proteins to participate in cellular physiological functions. Our review 
discusses in depth the involvement of O-GlcNAcylation in the precise regulation 
of skeletal muscle metabolism, such as glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, 
tricarboxylic acid cycle and mitochondrial biogenesis. The complex interaction 
and precise modulation of O-GlcNAcylation in these nutritional pathways of 
skeletal muscle also provide emerging mechanical information on how nutrients 
affect health, exercise and disease. Meanwhile, we explored the potential role 
of O-GlcNAcylation in skeletal muscle pathology and focused on its benefits in 
maintaining proteostasis under atrophy. In general, these understandings of 
O-GlcNAcylation are conducive to providing new insights into skeletal muscle 
(patho) physiology.
