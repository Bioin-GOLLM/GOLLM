PURPOSE: A high rate of response to treatment with epidermal growth factor 
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) has been observed in certain 
patients (women, of East Asian ethnicity, with non-smoking history and 
adenocarcinoma histology) with mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine 
kinase domain of EGFR. Some cases of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the 
lung harboring mutations have been sporadically reported.
METHODS: We describe the case of a 78-year-old woman with large-cell 
neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung, with mutation in exon 21 L858R and 
co-expression of adenocarcinoma markers.
RESULTS: A mass (3.0 cm in diameter) was identified in the inferior lobe of the 
left lung, accompanied by metastases into ipsilateral mediastinal lymph nodes 
and elevations of serum pro-gastrin-releasing peptide and carcinoembryonic 
antigen. Initial transbronchial brushing cytology suggested high-grade 
neuroendocrine carcinoma favoring small-cell carcinoma in poorly smeared and 
degenerated preparations, and revealed exon 21 L858R mutation. Re-enlargement of 
the cancer and bone metastases was observed after chemotherapy, and further 
testing suggested large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with immunoreactivity to 
markers of primary lung adenocarcinoma and L858R mutation. High-grade 
neuroendocrine carcinoma with mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR 
may be associated with adenocarcinoma, as reviewed from the literature and may 
also apply to our case.
CONCLUSIONS: EGFR-TKI could provide better quality of life and survival in 
patients with advanced or relapsed high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with EGFR 
gene mutations. Further studies in this respect are warranted.
