The chicken has been a particularly useful model for the study of craniofacial 
development and disease for over a century due to their relatively large size, 
accessibility, and amenability for classical bead implantation and transplant 
experiments. Several naturally occurring mutant lines with craniofacial 
anomalies also exist and have been heavily utilized by developmental biologist 
for several decades. Two of the most well known lines, talpid(2) (ta(2)) and 
talpid(3) (ta(3)), represent the first spontaneous mutants to have the causative 
genes identified. Despite having distinct genetic causes, both mutants have 
recently been identified as ciliopathic. Excitingly, both of these mutants have 
been classified as models for human craniofacial ciliopathies: 
Oral-facial-digital syndrome (ta(2)) and Joubert syndrome (ta(3)). Herein, we 
review and compare these two models of craniofacial disease and highlight what 
they have revealed about the molecular and cellular etiology of ciliopathies. 
Furthermore, we outline how applying classical avian experiments and new 
technological advances (transgenics and genome editing) with naturally occurring 
avian mutants can add a tremendous amount to what we currently know about 
craniofacial ciliopathies.
