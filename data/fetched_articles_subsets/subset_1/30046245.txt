BACKGROUND: Asian populations are more likely to develop acral melanoma (AM) 
than Caucasians. The high-dose interferon (HD-IFN) α-2b regimen is the main 
adjuvant treatment for AM. TERT encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase 
reverse transcriptase, which plays an important role in melanoma. Frequent TERT 
mutation and increased TERT gene expression have been described in AM. Our study 
aimed to investigate the status and the clinical significance of TERT copy 
number in a large cohort of patients with AM and to analyze the relationship 
between TERT copy number gain and the efficiency of HD-IFN.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 573 melanoma samples were retrospectively 
collected and analyzed for TERT copy number via Sanger sequencing. Clinical data 
of patients were also collected.
RESULTS: TERT copy gain (copy number >2) was detected in 257 of the 573 patients 
with AM (44.9%). Of the 573 patients, 81 (14.1%) had a high copy gain (copy 
number >4). Patients with ulceration showed a significantly higher copy gain 
rate of TERT compared to the patients without ulceration (P=0.028). Patients 
with a tumor thicker than 4 mm also had a higher copy number rate of TERT than 
those with <4 mm (P=0.048). Our results showed that the overall survival (OS) 
was not significantly different between patients with and without TERT copy gain 
(P=0.890). However, among the 278 patients who received an HD-IFN regimen, 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between 
TERT copy gain and relapse-free survival (RFS) (P=0.008). In addition, 
multivariate Cox regression assays validated TERT copy gain to be an independent 
prognostic factor of RFS for patients with AM undergoing HD-IFN therapy (hazard 
ratio =1.50; P=0.019).
CONCLUSION: The copy number status of TERT might be a predictor for HD-IFN 
efficacy, but it is not a prognostic factor of OS in patients with AM.
