Exposure to the toxins methylene cyclopropyl acetic acid (MCPA) and methylene 
cyclopropyl glycine (MCPG) of unripe ackee and litchi fruit can lead to 
hypoglycemia and death; however, the molecular mechanisms by which MCPA and MCPG 
cause hypoglycemia have not been established in vivo To determine the in vivo 
mechanisms of action of these toxins, we infused them into conscious rodents and 
assessed rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis, hepatic acyl-CoA and 
hepatic acetyl-CoA content, and hepatocellular energy charge. MCPG suppressed 
rates of hepatic β-oxidation as reflected by reductions in hepatic ketogenesis, 
reducing both short- and medium-chain hepatic acyl-CoA concentrations. Hepatic 
acetyl-CoA content decreased, and hepatic glucose production was inhibited. MCPA 
also suppressed β-oxidation of short-chain acyl-CoAs, rapidly inhibiting hepatic 
ketogenesis and hepatic glucose production, depleting hepatic acetyl-CoA content 
and ATP content, while increasing other short-chain acyl-CoAs. Utilizing a 
recently developed positional isotopomer NMR tracer analysis method, we 
demonstrated that MCPA-induced reductions in hepatic acetyl-CoA content were 
associated with a marked reduction of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase (PC) flux. 
Taken together, these data reveal the in vivo mechanisms of action of MCPA and 
MCPG: the hypoglycemia associated with ingestion of these toxins can be ascribed 
mostly to MCPA- or MCPG-induced reductions in hepatic PC flux due to inhibition 
of β-oxidation of short-chain acyl-CoAs by MCPA or inhibition of both short- and 
medium-chain acyl-CoAs by MCPG with resultant reductions in hepatic acetyl-CoA 
content, with an additional contribution to hypoglycemia through reduced hepatic 
ATP stores by MCPA.
