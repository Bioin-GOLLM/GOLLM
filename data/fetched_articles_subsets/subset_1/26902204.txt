Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) is an apolipoprotein E receptor involved in 
long-term potentiation, learning, and memory. Given its role in cognition and 
its association with the Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene, apoE, ApoER2 has 
been proposed to be involved in AD, though a role for the receptor in the 
disease is not clear. ApoER2 signaling requires amino acids encoded by 
alternatively spliced exon 19. Here, we report that the balance of ApoER2 exon 
19 splicing is deregulated in postmortem brain tissue from AD patients and in a 
transgenic mouse model of AD To test the role of deregulated ApoER2 splicing in 
AD, we designed an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that increases exon 19 
splicing. Treatment of AD mice with a single dose of ASO corrected ApoER2 
splicing for up to 6 months and improved synaptic function and learning and 
memory. These results reveal an association between ApoER2 isoform expression 
and AD, and provide preclinical evidence for the utility of ASOs as a 
therapeutic approach to mitigate Alzheimer's disease symptoms by improving 
ApoER2 exon 19 splicing.
