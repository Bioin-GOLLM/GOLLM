OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pattern of vision loss and genotype-phenotype 
correlations in WFS1-associated optic neuropathy (WON).
DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study.
METHODS: The study involved 37 patients with WON carrying pathogenic or 
candidate pathogenic WFS1 variants. Genetic and clinical data were retrieved 
from the medical records. Thirteen patients underwent additional comprehensive 
ophthalmologic assessment. Deep phenotyping involved visual electrophysiology 
and advanced psychophysical testing with a complementary metabolomic study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: WFS1 variants, functional and structural optic nerve and 
retinal parameters, and metabolomic profile.
RESULTS: Twenty-two recessive and 5 dominant WFS1 variants were identified. Four 
variants were novel. All WFS1 variants caused loss of macular retinal ganglion 
cells (RGCs) as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual 
electrophysiology. Advanced psychophysical testing indicated involvement of the 
major RGC subpopulations. Modeling of vision loss showed an accelerated rate of 
deterioration with increasing age. Dominant WFS1 variants were associated with 
abnormal reflectivity of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) on OCT imaging. The 
dominant variants tended to cause less severe vision loss compared with 
recessive WFS1 variants, which resulted in more variable phenotypes ranging from 
isolated WON to severe multisystem disease depending on the WFS1 alleles. The 
metabolomic profile included markers seen in other neurodegenerative diseases 
and type 1 diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSIONS: WFS1 variants result in heterogenous phenotypes influenced by the 
mode of inheritance and the disease-causing alleles. Biallelic WFS1 variants 
cause more variable, but generally more severe, vision and RGC loss compared 
with heterozygous variants. Abnormal cleftlike lamination of the OPL is a 
distinctive OCT feature that strongly points toward dominant WON.
