Streptococcus pneumoniae is a clinically important pathogen responsible for 
significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Disruption of the host gut 
microbiota by antibiotics reduces the pulmonary resistance to S. pneumoniae. The 
aim of our study was to determine the potential role of TLR4 in the reduced 
pulmonary resistance to S. pneumoniae following gut microbiota disruption. 
Wild-type and TLR4-deficient mice were given broad-spectrum antibiotics for 3 
weeks by oral gavage to disrupt the gut microbiota, and subsequently inoculated 
intra-nasally with S. pneumoniae. The extent of the decline in pulmonary 
resistance in both animal groups was evaluated in terms of the overall survival 
and pulmonary bacterial clearance. Both survival and pulmonary clearance of S. 
pneumoniae were lower in the TLR4-deficient mice with disrupted gut microbiota, 
compared to their intestinally healthy counterparts after pneumococcal 
infection. However, the degree of decline was much lower in the TLR4-deficient 
mice compared to the wild-type mice. Our findings indicate that impaired TLR4 
function might be the basis of the reduced pulmonary resistance to S. pneumoniae 
caused by gut microbiota disruption.
