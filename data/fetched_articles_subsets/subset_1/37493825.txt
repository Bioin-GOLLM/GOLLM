Onion skins, actually recycled as organic fertilizers, could be used as a 
substrate in environmental-friendly bioprocesses to recover high-value bioactive 
compounds and food ingredients.In this work, a bioprospecting method was carried 
out including 94 bacterial and 45 yeast strains from several agri-food and 
environmental niches to verify their ability to grow on onion skins as unique 
nutrients source.Red and yellow onion skins were assessed by newly selected 
starter-driven liquid submerged fermentation assays mainly aimed at the release 
and modification of polyphenols through microbial activities. Fermented onion 
skins were also investigated as a inexpensive favourable source of microbial 
enzymes (amylases, proteases, lipases, esterases, cellulases, xylanases).In red 
onion skins, the treatment with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum TB 11-32 produced 
a slight increase of bioactive compounds in terms of total phenolics, whereas 
with the yeast strain Zygosaccharomyces mrakii CL 30 - 29 the quercetin aglycone 
content increased of about 25% of the initial raw material.In yellow onion skins 
inoculated, the highest content of phenolic compounds was detected with the 
yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae En SC, while quercetin aglycone increased 
of about 60% of the initial raw material in presence of the bacterial strain L. 
plantarum C 180 - 34.In conclusion, the proposed microbial pre-treatment method 
can be a potential strategy to re-use onion skins as a fermentation substrate, 
and as a first step in the development of a biorefinery process to produce 
value-added products from onion by-products.
