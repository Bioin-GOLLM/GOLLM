Cancer is a leading public health problem worldwide. Its treatment remains a 
daunting challenge, although significant progress has been made in existing 
treatments in recent years. A large concern is the poor therapeutic effect due 
to lack of specificity and low bioavailability. Gene therapy has recently 
emerged as a powerful tool for cancer therapy. However, delivery methods limit 
its therapeutic effects. Exosomes, a subset of extracellular vesicles secreted 
by most cells, have the characteristics of good biocompatibility, low toxicity 
and immunogenicity, and great designability. In the past decades, as therapeutic 
carriers and diagnostic markers, they have caught extensive attention. This 
review introduced the characteristics of exosomes, and focused on 
their applications as delivery carriers in DNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA 
(miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), circular RNA (circRNA) and other nucleic 
acids. Meanwhile, their application in cancer therapy and exosome-based clinical 
trials were presented and discussed. Through systematic summarization and 
analysis, the recent advances and current challenges of exosome-mediated nucleic 
acid delivery for cancer therapy are introduced, which will provide a 
theoretical basis for the development of nucleic acid drugs.
