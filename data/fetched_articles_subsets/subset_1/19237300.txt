The unfolded protein response as a consequence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress has recently been implicated as a novel mechanism that may lead to 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Impairment of proper ER stress resolution in 
highly secretory Paneth and, to a lesser extent, goblet cells within the 
epithelium can primarily lead to intestinal inflammation. An inability to manage 
ER stress may not only be a primary originator of intestinal inflammation as 
exemplified by genetic polymorphisms in XBP1 that are associated with IBD but 
also a perpetuator of inflammation when ER stress is induced secondarily to 
inflammatory mediators or microbial factors. Furthermore, ER stress pathways may 
interact with other processes that lead to IBD, notably autophagy.
