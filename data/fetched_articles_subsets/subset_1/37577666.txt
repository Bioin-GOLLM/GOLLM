Steady-state expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) explain only a fraction 
of disease-associated loci identified through genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS), while eQTLs involved in gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions have 
rarely been characterized in humans due to experimental challenges. Using a 
baboon model, we found hundreds of eQTLs that emerge in adipose, liver, and 
muscle after prolonged exposure to high dietary fat and cholesterol. 
Diet-responsive eQTLs exhibit genomic localization and genic features that are 
distinct from steady-state eQTLs. Furthermore, the human orthologs associated 
with diet-responsive eQTLs are enriched for GWAS genes associated with human 
metabolic traits, suggesting that context-responsive eQTLs with more complex 
regulatory effects are likely to explain GWAS hits that do not seem to overlap 
with standard eQTLs. Our results highlight the complexity of genetic regulatory 
effects and the potential of eQTLs with disease-relevant GxE interactions in 
enhancing the understanding of GWAS signals for human complex disease using 
nonhuman primate models.
