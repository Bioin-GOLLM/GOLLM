Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasing cause of chronic 
liver illness associated with obesity and metabolic disorders, such as 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, or type 2 diabetes mellitus. A more severe type of 
NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is considered an ongoing global 
health threat and dramatically increases the risks of cirrhosis, liver failure, 
and hepatocellular carcinoma. Several reports have demonstrated that liver 
steatosis is associated with the elevation of certain clinical and biochemical 
markers but with low predictive potential. In addition, current imaging methods 
are inaccurate and inadequate for quantification of liver steatosis and do not 
distinguish clearly between the microvesicular and the macrovesicular types. On 
the other hand, an unhealthy status usually presents an altered gut microbiota, 
associated with the loss of its functions. Indeed, NAFLD pathophysiology has 
been linked to lower microbial diversity and a weakened intestinal barrier, 
exposing the host to bacterial components and stimulating pathways of immune 
defense and inflammation via toll-like receptor signaling. Moreover, this 
activation of inflammation in hepatocytes induces progression from simple 
steatosis to NASH. In the present review, we aim to: (a) summarize studies on 
both human and animals addressed to determine the impact of alterations in gut 
microbiota in NASH; (b) evaluate the potential role of such alterations as 
biomarkers for prognosis and diagnosis of this disorder; and (c) discuss the 
involvement of microbiota in the current treatment for NAFLD/NASH (i.e., 
bariatric surgery, physical exercise and lifestyle, diet, probiotics and 
prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation).
