The AIRE gene plays a key role in the development of central immune tolerance by 
promoting thymic presentation of tissue-specific molecules. Patients with 
AIRE-deficiency develop multiple autoimmune manifestations and display 
autoantibodies against the affected tissues. In 2016 it was reported that: i) 
the spectrum of autoantibodies in patients with AIRE-deficiency is much broader 
than previously appreciated; ii) neutralizing autoantibodies to type I 
interferons (IFNs) could provide protection against type 1 diabetes in these 
patients (Meyer et al., 2016). We attempted to replicate these new findings 
using a similar experimental approach in an independent patient cohort, and 
found no evidence for either conclusion.
