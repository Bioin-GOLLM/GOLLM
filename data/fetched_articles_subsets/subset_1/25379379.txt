We isolated a chronologically long-lived mutant of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and 
found a new mutation in pma1 (+) that encoded for an essential P-type proton 
ATPase. An Asp-138 to Asn mutation resulted in reduced Pma1 activity, 
concomitant with an increase in the chronological lifespan of this fission 
yeast. This study corroborates our previous report indicating Pma1 activity is 
crucial for the determination of life span of fission yeast, and offers 
information for better understanding of the enzyme, Pma1.
