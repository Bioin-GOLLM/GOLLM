BACKGROUND: The main features of severe congenital neutropenia are the onset of 
severe bacterial infections early in life, a paucity of mature neutrophils, and 
an increased risk of leukemia. In many patients, the genetic causes of severe 
congenital neutropenia are unknown.
METHODS: We performed genomewide genotyping and linkage analysis on two 
consanguineous pedigrees with a total of five children affected with severe 
congenital neutropenia. Candidate genes from the linkage interval were 
sequenced. Functional assays and reconstitution experiments were carried out.
RESULTS: All index patients were susceptible to bacterial infections and had 
very few mature neutrophils in the bone marrow; structural heart defects, 
urogenital abnormalities, and venous angiectasia on the trunk and extremities 
were additional features. Linkage analysis of the two index families yielded a 
combined multipoint lod score of 5.74 on a linkage interval on chromosome 17q21. 
Sequencing of G6PC3, the candidate gene encoding glucose-6-phosphatase, 
catalytic subunit 3, revealed a homozygous missense mutation in exon 6 that 
abolished the enzymatic activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in all affected 
children in the two families. The patients' neutrophils and fibroblasts had 
increased susceptibility to apoptosis. The myeloid cells showed evidence of 
increased endoplasmic reticulum stress and increased activity of glycogen 
synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta). We identified seven additional, unrelated 
patients who had severe congenital neutropenia with syndromic features and 
distinct biallelic mutations in G6PC3.
CONCLUSIONS: Defective function of glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit 3, 
underlies a severe congenital neutropenia syndrome associated with cardiac and 
urogenital malformations.
