EFhd2 is a conserved calcium-binding protein that is highly expressed in the 
central nervous system. We have shown that EFhd2 interacts with tau protein, a 
key pathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. However, 
EFhd2's physiological and pathological functions in the brain are still poorly 
understood. To gain insights into its physiological function, we identified 
proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with EFhd2 from mouse forebrain and 
hindbrain, using tandem mass spectrometry (MS). In addition, quantitative mass 
spectrometry was used to detect protein abundance changes due to the deletion of 
the Efhd2 gene in mouse forebrain and hindbrain regions. Our data show that 
mouse EFhd2 is associated with cytoskeleton components, vesicle trafficking 
modulators, cellular stress response-regulating proteins, and metabolic 
proteins. Moreover, proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, vesicular 
transport, calcium signaling, stress response, and metabolic pathways showed 
differential abundance in Efhd2(-/-) mice. This study presents, for the first 
time, an EFhd2 brain interactome that it is associated with different cellular 
and molecular processes. These findings will help prioritize further studies to 
investigate the mechanisms by which EFhd2 modulates these processes in 
physiological and pathological conditions of the nervous system.
