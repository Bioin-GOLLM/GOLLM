We studied a Malian family with parental consanguinity and two of eight siblings 
affected with late-childhood-onset progressive myoclonus epilepsy and cognitive 
decline, consistent with the diagnosis of Lafora disease. Genetic analysis 
showed a novel homozygous single-nucleotide variant in the NHLRC1 gene, 
c.560A>C, producing the missense change H187P. The changed amino acid is highly 
conserved, and the mutation impairs malin's ability to degrade laforin in vitro. 
Pathological evaluation showed manifestations of Lafora disease in the entire 
brain, with particularly severe involvement of the pallidum, thalamus, and 
cerebellum. Our findings document Lafora disease with severe manifestations in 
the West African population.
