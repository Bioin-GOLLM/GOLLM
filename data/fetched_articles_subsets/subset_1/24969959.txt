The disruption of membranes by antimicrobial peptides is a multi-state process 
involving significant structural changes in the phospholipid bilayer. However, 
direct measurement of these membrane structural changes is lacking. We used a 
combination of dual polarisation interferometry (DPI), surface plasmon resonance 
spectroscopy (SPR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure the real-time 
changes in membrane structure through the measurement of birefringence during 
the binding of magainin 2 (Mag2) and a highly potent analogue in which Ser(8), 
Gly(13) and Gly(18) has been replaced with alanine (Mag-A). We show that the 
membrane bilayer undergoes a series of structural changes upon peptide binding 
before a critical threshold concentration is reached which triggers a 
significant membrane disturbance. We also propose a detailed model for 
antimicrobial peptide action as a function of the degree of bilayer disruption 
to provide an unprecedented in-depth understanding of the membrane lysis in 
terms of the interconversion of different membrane conformational states in 
which there is a balance between recovery and lysis.
