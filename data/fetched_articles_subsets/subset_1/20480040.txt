In this review we discuss the development of paramagnetic liposomes 
incorporating MRI contrast agents and show how these are utilized in cellular 
imaging in vitro. Bi-functional, bi-modal imaging paramagnetic liposome systems 
are also described. Next we discuss the upgrading of paramagnetic liposomes into 
bi-modal imaging neutral nanoparticles for in vivo imaging applications. We 
discuss the development of such systems and show how paramagnetic liposomes and 
imaging nanoparticles could be developed as platforms for future 
multi-functional, multi-modal imaging theranostic nanodevices tailor-made for 
the combined imaging of early stage disease pathology and functional drug 
delivery.
