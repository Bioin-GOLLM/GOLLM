Oxidative stress stemming from tissue exposure to constant hyperglycemia is one 
of the major pathogenetic pathways of diabetic macro- and microvascular 
complications. Diabetic polyneuropathy, commonly manifesting as distal, 
symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy, is characterized by progressive 
severity of symptoms, with rates analogous to the quality of glycemic control 
achieved by the patients and physicians. Palliative care with analgesics and 
aggressive glycemic control often improve quality of life in the absence of 
causative treatment. Currently, there is a growing body of evidence indicating 
the role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, with 
emphasis on diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy. Therefore, in this review, we 
aim to explore the role of microRNAs and their polymorphisms in the 
pathophysiology of diabetic polyneuropathy, as well as, the possibility of novel 
diagnostic and therapeutic applications by epigenetic profiling and 
manipulation.
