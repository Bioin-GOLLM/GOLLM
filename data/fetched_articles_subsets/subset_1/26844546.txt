BACKGROUND: Depending on the epidemiological setting, a variable proportion of 
leprosy patients will suffer from excessive pro-inflammatory responses, termed 
type-1 reactions (T1R). The LRRK2 gene encodes a multi-functional protein that 
has been shown to modulate pro-inflammatory responses. Variants near the LRRK2 
gene have been associated with leprosy in some but not in other studies. We 
hypothesized that LRRK2 was a T1R susceptibility gene and that inconsistent 
association results might reflect different proportions of patients with T1R in 
the different sample settings. Hence, we evaluated the association of LRRK2 
variants with T1R susceptibility.
METHODOLOGY: An association scan of the LRRK2 locus was performed using 156 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Evidence of association was evaluated in 
two family-based samples: A set of T1R-affected and a second set of T1R-free 
families. Only SNPs significant for T1R-affected families with significant 
evidence of heterogeneity relative to T1R-free families were considered 
T1R-specific. An expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis was applied 
to evaluate the impact of T1R-specific SNPs on LRRK2 gene transcriptional 
levels.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 18 T1R-specific variants organized in four bins 
were detected. The core SNP capturing the T1R association was the LRRK2 missense 
variant M2397T (rs3761863) that affects LRRK2 protein turnover. Additionally, a 
bin of nine SNPs associated with T1R were eQTLs for LRRK2 in unstimulated whole 
blood cells but not after exposure to Mycobacterium leprae antigen.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results support a preferential association of LRRK2 variants 
with T1R. LRRK2 involvement in T1R is likely due to a pathological 
pro-inflammatory loop modulated by LRRK2 availability. Interestingly, the M2397T 
variant was reported in association with Crohn's disease with the same risk 
allele as in T1R suggesting common inflammatory mechanism in these two distinct 
diseases.
