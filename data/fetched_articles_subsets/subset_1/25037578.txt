BACKGROUND: Thymosin beta 10 (Tbeta10) overexpression has been reported in a 
variety of human cancers. However, the role of Tbeta10 in hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyze 
Tbeta10 expression in tumor and matched non-tumorous tissues, and to assess its 
prognostic significance for HCC after hepatectomy.
METHODS: The level of Tbeta10 mRNA and protein in tumor and matched non-tumorous 
tissues was evaluated in 26 fresh HCC cases by reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot. Additionally, Tbeta10 protein 
expression in 196 HCC was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlated 
with clinicopathological characteristics and survival.
RESULTS: Results from RT-PCR and western blot analysis show that the levels of 
Tbeta10 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in tumor tissues of HCC, 
compared to that in matched non-tumorous tissues (P = 0.01 and P < 0.001, 
respectively). IHC staining showed that high expression of Tbeta10 was detected 
in 58.2% (114/196) of HCC cases. High expression of Tbeta10 was significantly 
associated with advanced TNM stage (P < 0.001). Survival analysis demonstrated 
that high Tbeta10 was related to shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.000) and 
disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis showed that high 
expression of Tbeta10 was an independent prognostic factor for both OS 
(P = 0.001, HR = 4.135, 95% CI: 2.603 to 6.569) and DFS (P = 0.001, HR = 2.021, 
95% CI: 1.442 to 2.832). Subgroup analysis revealed that high expression of 
Tbeta10 predicts poorer survival for early and advanced stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Tbeta10 protein abnormal expression might contribute to the 
malignant progression of HCC. High expression of Tbeta10 predicts poor prognosis 
in patients with HCC after hepatectomy.
