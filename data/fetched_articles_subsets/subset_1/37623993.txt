An emerging multidrug-resistant pathogenic yeast called Candida auris has a high 
potential to spread quickly among hospitalized patients and immunodeficient 
patients causing nosocomial outbreaks. It has the potential to cause pandemic 
outbreaks in about 45 nations with high mortality rates. Additionally, the 
fungus has become resistant to decontamination techniques and can survive for 
weeks in a hospital environment. Nanoparticles might be a good substitute to 
treat illnesses brought on by this newly discovered pathogen. Nanoparticles have 
become a trend and hot topic in recent years to combat this fatal fungus. This 
review gives a general insight into the epidemiology of C. auris and infection. 
It discusses the current conventional therapy and mechanism of resistance 
development. Furthermore, it focuses on nanoparticles, their different types, 
and up-to-date trials to evaluate the promising efficacy of nanoparticles with 
respect to C. auris.
