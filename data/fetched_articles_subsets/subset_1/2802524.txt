The polymorphisms of the complement components C2, C3, C4 and BF have been 
studied in a sample of 166 unrelated individuals from Northern Greece. The C3*F 
and BF*F allele frequencies of Greeks are within the range of frequencies 
reported from Europe. A single individual with a rare heterozygote variant 
C2C/C2A was found in Greeks. This C2*A allele was found for the first time in 
European Caucasoids. For the C4 system six different alleles were found at both 
C4A and C4B loci. There were a low frequency of the null alleles at the C4A 
locus and a relatively high incidence of gene duplications in this system.
