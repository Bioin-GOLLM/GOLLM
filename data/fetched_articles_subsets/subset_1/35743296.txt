Carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation performance heavily depends on the surface-active 
species and the oxygen vacancies of nanocomposites. Herein, the 
CuOx/Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 were fabricated via solid-state strategy. It is manifested 
that the construction of CuOx/Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 nanocomposite can produce abundant 
surface CuOx species and a number of oxygen vacancies, resulting in 
substantially enhanced CO oxidation activity. The CO is completely converted to 
carbon dioxide (CO2) at 75 Â°C when CuOx/Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 nanocomposites were 
involved, which is higher than individual CuOx, MnOx, and Cu1.5Mn1.5O4. Density 
function theory (DFT) calculations suggest that CO and O2 are adsorbed on 
CuOx/Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 surface with relatively optimal adsorption energy, which is 
more beneficial for CO oxidation activity. This work presents an effective way 
to prepare heterogeneous metal oxides with promising application in catalysis.
