Arginase II activity regulates cytosolic Ca(2+) level in a p32-dependent manner

Although arginase II (ArgII) is abundant in mitochondria, Ca2+-accumulating 
organelles, the relationship between ArgII activity and Ca2+ translocation into 
mitochondria and the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ signaling are completely 
unknown. We investigated the effects of ArgII activity on mitochondrial Ca2+ 
uptake through mitochondrial p32 protein (p32m) and on CaMKII-dependent vascular 
smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contraction. Native low-density lipoprotein 
stimulation induced an increase in [Ca2+]m as measured by CoCl2-quenched 
calcein-AM fluorescence, which was prevented by Arg inhibition in hAoSMCs and 
reduced in mAoSMCs from ArgII-/- mice. Conversely, [Ca2+]c analyzed with Fluo-4 
AM was increased by Arg inhibition and ArgII gene knockout. The increased 
[Ca2+]c resulted in CaMKII and MLC 20 phosphorylation, which was associated with 
enhanced vasoconstriction activity to phenylephrine (PE) in the vascular tension 
assay. Cy5-tagged siRNA against mitochondrial p32 mRNA (sip32m) abolished 
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and induced activation of CaMKII. Spermine, a 
polyamine, induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and dephosphorylation of CaMKII and 
was completely inhibited by sip32m incubation. In mAoSMCs from ApoE-null mice 
fed a high-cholesterol diet (ApoE-/- +HCD), Arg activity was increased, and 
spermine concentration was higher than that of wild-type mice. Furthermore, 
[Ca2+]m and p32m levels were elevated, and CaMKII phosphorylation was reduced in 
mAoSMCs from ApoE-/- +HCD. In vascular tension experiments, an attenuated 
response to vasoconstrictors in de-endothelialized aorta from ApoE-/- +HCD was 
recovered by incubation of sip32m. ArgII activity-dependent production of 
spermine augments Ca2+ transition from the cytosol to the mitochondria in a 
p32m-dependent manner and regulates CaMKII-dependent constriction in VSMCs.
