BACKGROUND: Heidenhain variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) remains a 
diagnostic challenge in clinical practice. We aimed to describe the clinical and 
prognostic features of Heidenhain cases, through a case series study.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the definite or probable CJD cases admitted 
to two tertiary referral university hospitals over a decade to identify 
Heidenhain cases and investigated their survival status by telephone follow-up. 
Their clinical characteristics, neuroimaging features, electroencephalography 
(EEG) results, cerebrospinal fluid profiles, and PRNP gene mutations were also 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Of a total of 85 CJD cases, 20 (24%) Heidenhain cases (11 women [55%]; 
median age, 64 years [range, 44-72 years]) were identified. The median survival 
time was 22 weeks (range, 5-155 weeks). The median duration of isolated visual 
symptoms was 3 weeks (range, 1-12 weeks). The most common early visual symptom 
was blurred vision (16/20, 80%), followed by diplopia (6/20, 30%). The 
prevalence significantly increased for complex visual hallucination (p = 0.005) 
and cortical blindness (p = 0.046) as the disease progressed. The positive rate 
of serial magnetic resonance images (20/20, 100%) was higher than that of serial 
EEGs (16/20, 80%). Two patients (2/10, 20%) had pathogenic PRNP mutations, E196A 
and T188K, respectively. Heidenhain cases with PRNP mutations had significantly 
longer survival time than those without PRNP mutations (p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: Besides blurred vision (80%), diplopia (30%) was also a frequent 
early visual symptom among Heidenhain cases. Heidenhain phenotype can occur in 
genetic CJD cases. PRNP mutation status might be an important prognostic factor 
for Heidenhain cases.
