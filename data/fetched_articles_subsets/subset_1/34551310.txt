Cold-induced thermogenesis in endotherms demands adaptive thermogenesis fueled 
by mitochondrial respiration and Ucp1-mediated uncoupling in multilocular brown 
adipocytes (BAs). However, dietary regulation of thermogenesis in BAs isn't 
fully understood. Here, we describe that the deficiency of Leucine-rich 
pentatricopeptide repeat containing-protein (Lrpprc) in BAs reduces 
mtDNA-encoded ETC gene expression, causes ETC proteome imbalance, and abolishes 
the mitochondria-fueled thermogenesis. BA-specific Lrpprc knockout mice are cold 
resistant in a 4°C cold-tolerance test in the presence of food, which is 
accompanied by the activation of transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and proteome 
turnover in BAs. ATF4 activation genetically by BA-specific ATF4 overexpression 
or physiologically by a low-protein diet feeding can improve cold tolerance in 
wild-type and Ucp1 knockout mice. Furthermore, ATF4 activation in BAs improves 
systemic metabolism in obesogenic environment regardless of Ucp1's action. 
Therefore, our study reveals a diet-dependent but Ucp1-independent thermogenic 
mechanism in BAs that is relevant to systemic thermoregulation and energy 
homeostasis.
