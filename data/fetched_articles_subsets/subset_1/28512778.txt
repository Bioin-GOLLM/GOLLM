Understanding the basis of complex trait disease is a fundamental problem in 
human genetics. The CAGI Crohn's Exome challenges are providing insight into the 
adequacy of current disease models by requiring participants to identify which 
of a set of individuals has been diagnosed with the disease, given exome data. 
For the CAGI4 round, we developed a method that used the genotypes from exome 
sequencing data only to impute the status of genome wide association studies 
marker SNPs. We then used the imputed genotypes as input to several machine 
learning methods that had been trained to predict disease status from marker SNP 
information. We achieved the best performance using Naïve Bayes and with a 
consensus machine learning method, obtaining an area under the curve of 0.72, 
larger than other methods used in CAGI4. We also developed a model that 
incorporated the contribution from rare missense variants in the exome data, but 
this performed less well. Future progress is expected to come from the use of 
whole genome data rather than exomes.
