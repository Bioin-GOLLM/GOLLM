Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses (ARCI) are rare genodermatosis 
disorders characterized by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. At least 
fourteen genes so far have been related to ARCI; however, despite genetic 
heterogeneity, phenotypes associated with mutation of different ARCI genes may 
overlap, thereby making difficult their clinical and molecular classification. 
In addition, molecular tests for diagnosis of such an extremely rare 
heterogeneous inherited disease are not easily available in clinical settings. 
In the attempt of identifying the genetic cause of the disease in four Italian 
patients with ARCI, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis 
targeting 4811 genes that have been previously linked to human genetic diseases; 
we focused our analysis on the 13 known ARCI genes comprised in the panel. Nine 
different variants including three novel small nucleotide changes and two novel 
large deletions have been identified and validated in the ABCA12, ALOX12B, 
CYP4F22, and SULT2B1 genes. Notably, two patients had variants in more than one 
gene. The identification and validation of new pathogenic ABCA12, ALOX12B, 
CYP4F22, and SULT2B1 variants through multi-gene NGS in four cases of ARCI 
further highlight the importance of these genes in proper skin function and 
development.
