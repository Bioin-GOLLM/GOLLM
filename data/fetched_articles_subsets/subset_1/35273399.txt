The role of histone modifications in transcription remains incompletely 
understood. Here, we examine the relationship between histone modifications and 
transcription using experimental perturbations combined with sensitive 
machine-learning tools. Transcription predicted the variation in active histone 
marks and complex chromatin states, like bivalent promoters, down to 
single-nucleosome resolution and at an accuracy that rivaled the correspondence 
between independent ChIP-seq experiments. Blocking transcription rapidly removed 
two punctate marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, from chromatin indicating that 
transcription is required for active histone modifications. Transcription was 
also required for maintenance of H3K27me3, consistent with a role for RNA in 
recruiting PRC2. A subset of DNase-I-hypersensitive sites were refractory to 
prediction, precluding models where transcription initiates pervasively at any 
open chromatin. Our results, in combination with past literature, support a 
model in which active histone modifications serve a supportive, rather than an 
essential regulatory, role in transcription.
