OBJECTIVE: To test the oncolytic activity of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) 
promoter-based conditional replication-selective adenovirus vector for squamous 
cell carcinoma cells of the head and neck.
DESIGN: In vitro study.
SUBJECTS: None.
INTERVENTIONS: A conditional replication-selective adenovirus vector in which 
the expression of E1a, required for viral replication, is controlled by the 
COX-2 promoter, Ad-COX2-E1a, was generated. Its oncolytic activity according to 
the levels of COX-2 and of Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor expression was 
tested in a series of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.
RESULTS: The respective COX-2 messenger RNA expression ratios of KB, H891, T891, 
T892, and L871 were 1.5, 60.0, 1.0, 14.6, and 1.3. The corresponding Coxsackie 
and adenovirus receptor messenger RNA expression ratios were 1, 1, 5, 3, and 1. 
In vitro assays showed significant growth suppression of cancer cell lines with 
strong expressions of COX-2.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the possibility of oncolytic therapy using 
the COX-2 promoter-based conditional replication-selective adenovirus for head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma expressing COX-2.
