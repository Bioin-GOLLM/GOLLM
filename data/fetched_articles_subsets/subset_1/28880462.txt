Indeterminate dendritic cell neoplasm (IDCN) is an exceedingly rare and mostly 
cutaneous histiocytosis, frequently associated with other hematopoietic 
malignancies. We report 2 cases of multilesional cutaneous IDCN. A 55-year-old 
male with no associated malignancy and complete response to ultraviolet 
phototherapy; and a 72-year-old male with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia 
(CMML). Both cases showed histiocytoid cytology, positivity for CD1a and no 
expression of langerin or BRAFV600E . With our patients, the literature 
describes 79 cases of IDCNs, including 65 (82%) with only skin involvement, 7 
cases (9%) with involvement of skin and a second site, 5 cases (6%) involving 
lymph nodes only, 1 splenic lesion and 1 systemic disease. Seventeen cases (22%) 
were associated with other hematopoietic malignancies, most commonly CMML (6 
cases), follicular lymphoma (4 cases) and acute myeloid leukemia (3 cases). All 
IDCNs associated with myeloid malignancies were limited to the skin, while most 
cases associated with lymphoma were limited to lymph nodes. Reported responses 
of cutaneous lesions to ultraviolet phototherapy are encouraging, while systemic 
chemotherapy is appropriate for clinically aggressive cases and treatment of 
associated malignancies. Recognition of the clinico-morphologic spectrum of 
IDCNs should prevent misdiagnoses and prompt investigation of possible 
associated neoplasms.
