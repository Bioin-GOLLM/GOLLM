Cerebral malaria is the most serious complication of malaria infection, with 26% 
of surviving children having neurological sequelae, which may be caused by 
neuron damage, but the mechanism is not clear. Ferroptosis has been reported to 
play an important role in neuron damage in several nervous system diseases. 
However, the occurrence of ferroptosis in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) 
pathogenesis is still unknown. In this study, we firstly detected increased 
levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and iron, which are indicators of ferroptosis, 
in the cerebrum of ECM mice. Some important regulators of ferroptosis, including 
upregulated expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and acyl-CoA synthetase 
long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), and downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 
4 (GPX4) levels, were also confirmed in ECM mice. Consistently, neuron damage, 
which was detected in the cerebrum of ECM mice, was positively correlated with 
reduced GPX4 expression and furtherly rescued by administration of the 
ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). In addition, primary neurons were 
damaged by activated CD8+ T cells, an effect that was also partially rescued by 
Fer-1 on amyloid precursor protein expression and mitochondrial membrane 
potential levels in vitro. Activated CD8+ T cells were also shown to infiltrate 
the cerebrum of ECM mice and upregulate TfR1 expression in primary neurons, 
which may be an important event for inducing ferroptosis in ECM. Altogether, we 
show that ferroptosis contributes to neuron damage in ECM pathogenesis, and 
activated CD8+ T cells may be important inducers of neuronal ferroptosis. Hence, 
targeting ferroptosis may be a promising adjuvant therapeutic strategy for 
neurological sequelae in patients with cerebral malaria.
