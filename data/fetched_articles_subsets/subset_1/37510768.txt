BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is closely associated 
with alcohol consumption and individual genetic susceptibility, such as single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). This study aimed 
to investigate the association of ADH7 SNPs with the risk of HNSCC.
METHODS: We analyzed ADH7 rs1573496C>G, rs3737482T>C, rs1154460G>A, and 
rs284787T>C SNPs in 250 patients with HNSCC and 322 controls in the Korean 
populations. Genotyping was conducted using the TaqMan assay. Linkage 
disequilibrium and haplotypes were analyzed.
RESULTS: The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the CT and CC 
genotypes of ADH7 rs3737482T>C were 0.48 (0.29-0.78) and 0.69 (0.49-0.96), 
indicating a significantly decreased risk. In SNP of rs1154460G>A, the OR and 
95% CI of the AA genotype was 1.63 (1.11-2.40), showing a significant increase 
in the risk. Furthermore, SNPs of ADH7 rs3737482T>C and ADH7 rs1154460G>A 
exhibit synergistic interactions with alcohol composition on the risk of HNSCC. 
None of the haplotypes were associated with the risk of HNSCC.
CONCLUSIONS: ADH7 rs3737482T>C and rs1154460G>A SNPs are associated with the 
risk of development of HNSCC in Koreans. They could serve as molecular 
biological markers to screen high-risk groups for HNSCC.
