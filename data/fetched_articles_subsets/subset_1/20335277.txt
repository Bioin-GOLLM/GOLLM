TopoGSA (Topology-based Gene Set Analysis) is a web-application dedicated to the 
computation and visualization of network topological properties for gene and 
protein sets in molecular interaction networks. Different topological 
characteristics, such as the centrality of nodes in the network or their 
tendency to form clusters, can be computed and compared with those of known 
cellular pathways and processes.
