Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by selective, early degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and 
spinal cord. Motor neurons have long axonal projections, which rely on the 
integrity of neuronal cytoskeleton and mitochondria to regulate energy 
requirements for maintaining axonal stability, anterograde and retrograde 
transport, and signaling between neurons. The formation of protein aggregates 
which contain cytoskeletal proteins, and mitochondrial dysfunction both have 
devastating effects on the function of neurons and are shared pathological 
features across several neurodegenerative conditions, including ALS, Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
disease. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that cytoskeletal 
integrity and mitochondrial function are intricately linked. Therefore, 
dysregulations of the cytoskeletal network and mitochondrial homeostasis and 
localization, may be common pathways in the initial steps of neurodegeneration. 
Here we review and discuss known contributors, including variants in genetic 
loci and aberrant protein activities, which modify cytoskeletal integrity, 
axonal transport and mitochondrial localization in ALS and have overlapping 
features with other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we explore some 
emerging pathways that may contribute to this disruption in ALS.
