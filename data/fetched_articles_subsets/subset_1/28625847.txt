Enteroviruses use a type I Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) structure to 
facilitate protein synthesis and promote genome replication. Type I IRES 
elements require auxiliary host proteins to organize RNA structure for 40S 
ribosomal subunit assembly. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 
stimulates enterovirus 71 (EV71) translation in part through specific 
interactions with its stem loop II (SLII) IRES domain. Here, we determined a 
conjoined NMR-small angle x-ray scattering structure of the EV71 SLII domain and 
a mutant that significantly attenuates viral replication by abrogating hnRNP A1 
interactions. Native SLII adopts a locally compact structure wherein stacking 
interactions in a conserved 5'-AUAGC-3' bulge preorganize the adjacent helices 
at nearly orthogonal orientations. Mutating the bulge sequence to 5'-ACCCC-3' 
ablates base stacking in the loop and globally reorients the SLII structure. 
Biophysical titrations reveal that the 5'-AUAGC-3' bulge undergoes a 
conformational change to assemble a functional hnRNP A1-RNA complex. 
Importantly, IRES mutations that delete the bulge impair viral translation and 
completely inhibit replication. Thus, this work provides key details into how an 
EV71 IRES structure adapts to hijack a cellular protein, and it suggests that 
the SLII domain is a potential target for antiviral therapy.
