More than any other methodology, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has 
contributed to our understanding of the architecture and organization of cells. 
With current detection limits approaching atomic resolution, it will ultimately 
become possible to ultrastructurally image intracellular macromolecular 
assemblies in situ. Presently, however, methods to unambiguously identify 
proteins within the crowded environment of the cell's interior are lagging 
behind. We describe an approach, metal-tagging TEM (METTEM), that allows 
detection of intracellular proteins in mammalian cells with high specificity, 
exceptional sensitivity, and at molecular scale resolution. In live cells 
treated with gold salts, proteins bearing a small metal-binding tag will form 
1-nm gold nanoclusters, readily detectable in electron micrographs. The 
applicability and strength of METTEM is demonstrated by a study of Rubella virus 
replicase and capsid proteins, which revealed virus-induced cell structures not 
seen before.
