Chondrosarcoma (CHS) is a malignant cartilage-forming tumor and usually occurs 
within the medullary canal of long bones and pelvic bones. Based on the 
morphologic feature alone, a correct diangosis of CHS may be difficult, 
Therefore, correlation of radiological and clinicopathological features is 
mandatory in the diagnosis of CHS. The prognosis of CHS is closely related to 
histologic grading, however, histologic grading may be subjective with high 
inter-observer variability. In this paper, we present histologic grading system 
and clinicopathological and radiological findings of conventional CHS. Subtypes 
of CHSs, such as dedifferentiated, mesenchymal, and clear cell CHSs are also 
presented. In addition, we introduce updated cytogenetic and molecular genetic 
findings to expand our understanding of CHS biology. New markers of cell 
differentiation, proliferation, and cell signaling might offer important 
therapeutic and prognostic information in near future.
