CONTEXT: Mutations in the MCT8 (SLC16A2) gene, encoding a specific thyroid 
hormone transporter, cause an X-linked disease with profound psychomotor 
retardation, neurological impairment, and abnormal serum thyroid hormone levels. 
The nature of the central nervous system damage is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to define the neuropathology of the 
syndrome by analyzing brain tissue sections from MCT8-deficient subjects.
DESIGN: We analyzed brain sections from a 30th gestational week male fetus and 
an 11-year-old boy and as controls, brain tissue from a 30th and 28th 
gestational week male and female fetuses, respectively, and a 10-year-old girl 
and a 12-year-old boy.
METHODS: Staining with hematoxylin-eosin and immunostaining for myelin basic 
protein, 70-kDa neurofilament, parvalbumin, calbindin-D28k, and synaptophysin 
were performed. Thyroid hormone determinations and quantitative PCR for 
deiodinases were also performed.
RESULTS: The MCT8-deficient fetus showed a delay in cortical and cerebellar 
development and myelination, loss of parvalbumin expression, abnormal 
calbindin-D28k content, impaired axonal maturation, and diminished biochemical 
differentiation of Purkinje cells. The 11-year-old boy showed altered cerebellar 
structure, deficient myelination, deficient synaptophysin and parvalbumin 
expression, and abnormal calbindin-D28k expression. The MCT8-deficient fetal 
cerebral cortex showed 50% reduction of thyroid hormones and increased type 2 
deiodinase and decreased type 3 deiodinase mRNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: The following conclusions were reached: 1) brain damage in MCT8 
deficiency is diffuse, without evidence of focal lesions, and present from fetal 
stages despite apparent normality at birth; 2) deficient hypomyelination 
persists up to 11 years of age; and 3) the findings are compatible with the 
deficient action of thyroid hormones in the developing brain caused by impaired 
transport to the target neural cells.
