Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is defined by several symptom criteria, which can be 
dissected further at the genetic level. Over the past several years, our 
understanding of the genetic factors influencing alcohol use and abuse has 
progressed tremendously; numerous loci have been implicated in different aspects 
of alcohol use. Previously known associations with alcohol-metabolizing enzymes 
(ADH1B, ALDH2) have been replicated definitively. In addition, novel 
associations with loci containing the genes KLB, GCKR, CRHR1, and CADM2 have 
been reported. Downstream analyses have leveraged these genetic findings to 
reveal important relationships between alcohol use behaviors and both physical 
and mental health. AUD and aspects of alcohol misuse have been shown to overlap 
strongly with psychiatric disorders, whereas aspects of alcohol consumption have 
shown stronger links to metabolism. These results demonstrate that the genetic 
architecture of alcohol consumption only partially overlaps with the genetics of 
clinically defined AUD. We discuss the limitations of using quantitative 
measures of alcohol use as proxy measures for AUD, and we outline how future 
studies will require careful phenotype harmonization to properly capture the 
genetic liability to AUD.
