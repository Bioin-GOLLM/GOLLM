The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway plays an important role in several 
brain tumor entities. However, the lack of inhibitors crossing the blood-brain 
barrier remains a significant obstacle for clinical translation. Here, we 
targeted the IGF pathway using ceritinib, an off-target inhibitor of the IGF1 
receptor (IGF1R) and insulin receptor (INSR), in a pediatric patient with an 
unclassified brain tumor and a notch receptor 1 (NOTCH1) germline mutation. 
Pathway analysis of the tumor revealed activation of the sonic hedgehog (SHH), 
the wingless and integrated-1 (WNT), the IGF, and the Notch pathway. The 
proliferation of the patient tumor cells (225ZL) was inhibited by arsenic 
trioxide (ATO), which is an inhibitor of the SHH pathway, by linsitinib, which 
is an inhibitor of IGF1R and INSR, and by ceritinib. 225ZL expressed INSR but 
not IGF1R at the protein level, and ceritinib blocked the phosphorylation of 
INSR. Our first personalized treatment included ATO, but because of side 
effects, we switched to ceritinib. After 46 days, we achieved a concentration of 
1.70 µM of ceritinib in the plasma, and after 58 days, MRI confirmed that there 
was a response to the treatment. Ceritinib accumulated in the tumor at a 
concentration of 2.72 µM. Our data suggest ceritinib as a promising drug for the 
treatment of IGF-driven brain tumors.
