Methylation of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) exon 1/intron 1 
boundary positioned fragile X related epigenetic element 2 (FREE2), reveals 
skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in fragile X syndrome full mutation (FM: 
CGG > 200) females. XCI skewing has been also linked to abnormal X-linked gene 
expression with the broader clinical impact for sex chromosome aneuploidies 
(SCAs). In this study, 10 FREE2 CpG sites were targeted using methylation 
specific quantitative melt analysis (MS-QMA), including 3 sites that could not 
be analysed with previously used EpiTYPER system. The method was applied for 
detection of skewed XCI in FM females and in different types of SCA. We tested 
venous blood and saliva DNA collected from 107 controls (CGG < 40), and 148 FM 
and 90 SCA individuals. MS-QMA identified: (i) most SCAs if combined with a Y 
chromosome test; (ii) locus-specific XCI skewing towards the hypomethylated 
state in FM females; and (iii) skewed XCI towards the hypermethylated state in 
SCA with 3 or more X chromosomes, and in 5% of the 47,XXY individuals. MS-QMA 
output also showed significant correlation with the EpiTYPER reference method in 
FM males and females (P < 0.0001) and SCAs (P < 0.05). In conclusion, we 
demonstrate use of MS-QMA to quantify skewed XCI in two applications with 
diagnostic utility.
