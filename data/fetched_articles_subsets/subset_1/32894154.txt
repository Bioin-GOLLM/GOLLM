BACKGROUND: The prediction of potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) not only 
provides a better comprehension of biological processes but also is critical for 
identifying new drugs. However, due to the disadvantages of expensive and high 
time-consuming traditional experiments, only a small section of interactions 
between drugs and targets in the database were verified experimentally. 
Therefore, it is meaningful and important to develop new computational methods 
with good performance for DTIs prediction. At present, many existing 
computational methods only utilize the single type of interactions between drugs 
and proteins without paying attention to the associations and influences with 
other types of molecules.
METHODS: In this work, we developed a novel network embedding-based 
heterogeneous information integration model to predict potential drug-target 
interactions. Firstly, a heterogeneous multi-molecuar information network is 
built by combining the known associations among protein, drug, lncRNA, disease, 
and miRNA. Secondly, the Large-scale Information Network Embedding (LINE) model 
is used to learn behavior information (associations with other nodes) of drugs 
and proteins in the network. Hence, the known drug-protein interaction pairs can 
be represented as a combination of attribute information (e.g. protein sequences 
information and drug molecular fingerprints) and behavior information of 
themselves. Thirdly, the Random Forest classifier is used for training and 
prediction.
RESULTS: In the results, under the five-fold cross validation, our method 
obtained 85.83% prediction accuracy with 80.47% sensitivity at the AUC of 
92.33%. Moreover, in the case studies of three common drugs, the top 10 
candidate targets have 8 (Caffeine), 7 (Clozapine) and 6 (Pioglitazone) are 
respectively verified to be associated with corresponding drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: In short, these results indicate that our method can be a powerful 
tool for predicting potential drug-target interactions and finding unknown 
targets for certain drugs or unknown drugs for certain targets.
