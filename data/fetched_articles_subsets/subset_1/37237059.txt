The Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) is the largest 
biorepository of human pancreata and associated immune organs from donors with 
type 1 diabetes (T1D), maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), cystic 
fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), gestational diabetes, 
islet autoantibody positivity (AAb+), and without diabetes. nPOD recovers, 
processes, analyzes, and distributes high-quality biospecimens, collected using 
optimized standard operating procedures, and associated de-identified 
data/metadata to researchers around the world. Herein describes the release of 
high-parameter genotyping data from this collection. 372 donors were genotyped 
using a custom precision medicine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
microarray. Data were technically validated using published algorithms to 
evaluate donor relatedness, ancestry, imputed HLA, and T1D genetic risk score. 
Additionally, 207 donors were assessed for rare known and novel coding region 
variants via whole exome sequencing (WES). These data are publicly-available to 
enable genotype-specific sample requests and the study of novel 
genotype:phenotype associations, aiding in the mission of nPOD to enhance 
understanding of diabetes pathogenesis to promote the development of novel 
therapies.
