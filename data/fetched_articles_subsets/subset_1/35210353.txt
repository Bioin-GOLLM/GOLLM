More than 90% of genetic variants are rare in most modern sequencing studies, 
such as the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) whole-exome sequencing 
(WES) data. Furthermore, 54% of the rare variants in ADSP WES are singletons. 
However, both single variant and unit-based tests are limited in their 
statistical power to detect an association between rare variants and phenotypes. 
To best use missense rare variants and investigate their biological effect, we 
examine their association with phenotypes in the context of protein structures. 
We developed a protein structure-based approach, protein optimized kernel 
evaluation of missense nucleotides (POKEMON), which evaluates rare missense 
variants based on their spatial distribution within a protein rather than their 
allele frequency. The hypothesis behind this test is that the three-dimensional 
spatial distribution of variants within a protein structure provides functional 
context to power an association test. POKEMON identified three candidate genes 
(TREM2, SORL1, and EXOC3L4) and another suggestive gene from the ADSP WES data. 
For TREM2 and SORL1, two known Alzheimer's disease (AD) genes, the signal from 
the spatial cluster is stable even if we exclude known AD risk variants, 
indicating the presence of additional low-frequency risk variants within these 
genes. EXOC3L4 is a novel AD risk gene that has a cluster of variants primarily 
shared by case subjects around the Sec6 domain. This cluster is also validated 
in an independent replication data set and a validation data set with a larger 
sample size.
