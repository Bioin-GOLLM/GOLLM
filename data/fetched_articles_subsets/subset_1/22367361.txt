PURPOSE: Nine previously reported associations between single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) and breast cancer outcomes from the Shanghai Breast Cancer 
Study (Stage 1) were further evaluated in relation to disease-free survival 
(DFS) and overall survival (OS) among 5,192 additional breast cancer patients 
(Stage 2).
METHODS: Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by 
proportional hazards regression in models adjusted for age, disease stage, 
estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and treatment regimens.
RESULTS: Two SNPs had generally consistent results and significant associations 
with OS in combined analyses. Compared to women with MMP7 rs11225297 AA 
genotypes, OS was moderately better for women with AT genotypes (HR: 0.8, 95% 
CI: 0.7-1.0) and much better for women with TT genotypes (HR: 0.4, 95% CI: 
0.2-0.8). Compared to women with MMP8 rs11225395 CC genotypes, OS was slightly 
better for women with CT genotypes (HR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.7-1.1) and moderately 
better for women with TT genotypes (HR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.9). Joint analysis 
showed significant dose-response relationships with increasing numbers of rare 
alleles for both OS (p < 0.001) and DFS (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A functional variant in MMP8 and a SNP in high linkage 
disequilibrium with a functional variant in MMP7 were significantly associated 
with breast cancer survival in a large two-stage survival study among Chinese 
women. This supports the hypothesis that SNPs in matrix metalloproteinase genes 
may influence breast cancer prognosis; additional research on these and other 
SNPs in genes important in metastasis, angiogenesis, and the regulation of the 
tumor microenvironment is warranted.
