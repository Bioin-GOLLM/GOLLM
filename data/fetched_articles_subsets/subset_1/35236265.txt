In view of the significant role of H2S in brain functioning, it is proposed that 
H2S may also possess protective effects against adverse effects of 
neurotoxicants. Therefore, the objective of the present review is to discuss the 
neuroprotective effects of H2S against toxicity of a wide spectrum of endogenous 
and exogenous agents involved in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases as 
etiological factors or key players in disease pathogenesis. Generally, the 
existing data demonstrate that H2S possesses neuroprotective effects upon 
exposure to endogenous (amyloid β, glucose, and advanced-glycation end-products, 
homocysteine, lipopolysaccharide, and ammonia) and exogenous (alcohol, 
formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, metals, 6-hydroxydopamine, as well as 
1-methyl-4-phenyl- 1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its metabolite 
1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridine ion (MPP)) neurotoxicants. On the one hand, 
neuroprotective effects are mediated by S-sulfhydration of key regulators of 
antioxidant (Sirt1, Nrf2) and inflammatory response (NF-κB), resulting in the 
modulation of the downstream signaling, such as SIRT1/TORC1/CREB/BDNF-TrkB, 
Nrf2/ARE/HO-1, or other pathways. On the other hand, H2S appears to possess a 
direct detoxicative effect by binding endogenous (ROS, AGEs, Aβ) and exogenous 
(MeHg) neurotoxicants, thus reducing their toxicity. Moreover, the alteration of 
H2S metabolism through the inhibition of H2S-synthetizing enzymes in the brain 
(CBS, 3-MST) may be considered a significant mechanism of neurotoxicity. Taken 
together, the existing data indicate that the modulation of cerebral H2S 
metabolism may be used as a neuroprotective strategy to counteract neurotoxicity 
of a wide spectrum of endogenous and exogenous neurotoxicants associated with 
neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), fetal alcohol syndrome, 
hepatic encephalopathy, environmental neurotoxicant exposure, etc. In this 
particular case, modulation of H2S-synthetizing enzymes or the use of 
H2S-releasing drugs should be considered as the potential tools, although the 
particular efficiency and safety of such interventions are to be addressed in 
further studies.
