Preculture is indispensable for achieving highly efficient non-homologous end 
joining (NHEJ)-based genome editing. Here, we present a protocol for optimizing 
genome editing conditions for murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and 
evaluating their function following NHEJ-based genome editing. We describe steps 
for sgRNA preparation, cell sorting, preculture, and electroporation. We then 
detail post-editing culture and transplanting of bone marrow. This protocol can 
be used to study genes related to HSC quiescence. For complete details on the 
use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Shiroshita et al.1.
