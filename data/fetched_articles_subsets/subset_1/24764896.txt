In the title hydrate, C24H30N2O4·H2O, the organic mol-ecule adopts an E 
conformation with respect to the azomethine double bonds. The cyclo-hexane ring 
is in a chair conformation. The dihedral angle between benzene rings is 
79.6 (2)°. Two intra-molecular O-H⋯N hydrogen bonds are present. In the crystal, 
the components are linked by O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds and weak C-H⋯π inter-actions, 
generating a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture.
