The linkage of the intragenic polymorphic (GATT)n repeat to a number of cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene mutations (delta F-508, G542X, 
G551D, R553X, R1162X, W1282X, N1303K, R334W, and R347P) was studied. The linkage 
of delta F-508, G542X, and N1303K to a six-copy allele and of R334W to a 
seven-copy allele of the repeat was found.
