In addition to their canonical roles in translation the aminoacyl-tRNA 
synthetases (ARSs) have developed secondary functions over the course of 
evolution. Many of these activities are associated with cellular survival and 
nutritional stress responses essential for homeostatic processes in higher 
eukaryotes. In particular, six ARSs and one associated factor have documented 
functions in angiogenesis. However, despite their connection to this process, 
the ARSs are mechanistically distinct and exhibit a range of positive or 
negative effects on aspects of endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and 
survival. This variability is achieved through the appearance of appended 
domains and interplay with inflammatory pathways not found in prokaryotic 
systems. Complete knowledge of the non-canonical functions of ARSs is necessary 
to understand the mechanisms underlying the physiological regulation of 
angiogenesis.
