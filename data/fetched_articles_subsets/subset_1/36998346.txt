Herein we report the case of a patient with multiple glucagonomas that have been 
precisely described with endoscopic ultrasound. A 36-year-old woman was referred 
to our hospital for computed tomography investigation of multiple pancreatic 
masses. Physical examination was unremarkable; on contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography, mass lesions were evident in the head, body, and tail of the 
pancreas. The mass in the pancreatic head was poorly demarcated and exhibited a 
faint contrast effect, the one in the pancreatic body was a cystic lesion, and 
the one in the pancreatic tail was hypervascular. Blood investigations showed 
that serum glucagon was abnormally high at 7670 pg/ml; glucose tolerance was not 
impaired. There was no family history that suggested multiple endocrine 
neoplasia type 1 or von Hippel-Lindau disease. Endoscopic ultrasound revealed 
that there were additional masses, which were scattered isoechoic to hyperechoic 
lesions a few millimeters in size. Ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy of the 
lesion in the pancreatic tail resulted in a diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor. 
Based on these pathologic findings, we performed a total pancreatectomy. A large 
number of nodules with tumor cells were evident in all cut surfaces of the 
surgical specimen. Immunostaining was positive for chromogranin A and glucagon, 
and glucagonoma was therefore diagnosed. It is conceivable that attenuated 
glucagon action could have contributed to the development of the multiple 
glucagonomas.
