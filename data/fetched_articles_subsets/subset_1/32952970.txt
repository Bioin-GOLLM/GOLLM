Hepatic involvement in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) ranges from a 
nonspecific increase in liver enzymes to cryptogenic cirrhosis, and the liver is 
mostly involved in patients bearing the M694V MEFV mutation in homozygosis. A 
44-year-old Jewish woman with FMF developed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis during 
colchicine treatment (2,5 mg per day), confirmed by both elastography and liver 
biopsy. Therefore, combined therapy with the interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocking agent 
canakinumab (150 mg every four weeks) and colchicine (at a reduced dose of 1.5 
mg per day) was started. Three months later, transaminases became normal, and 
after further six months, there was a marked improvement of liver fibrosis. IL-1 
blockade has the power to halt or mitigate liver involvement in FMF patients. 
However, further experience is required to assess its therapeutic potential in 
the most severe patients with the hepatic disease who are partially responsive 
to long-term prophylaxis with colchicine.
