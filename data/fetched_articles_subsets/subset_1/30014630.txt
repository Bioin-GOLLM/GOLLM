OBJECTIVE: To research the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein 
gene (XIAP) on paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer.
METHODS: A2780 and A2780/T cells were treated with paclitaxel respectively at 
the concentrations of 5 ng/mL,10 ng/mL,20 ng/mL , 40 ng/mL,80 ng/mL,160 
ng/mL,320 ng/mL,then the inhibition rate of cells were detected by MTT assay. 
The expression of XIAP mRNA and protein among the A2780 and A2780/T cells 
treated respectively with paclitaxel at the concentration of 100 ng/mL was 
detected by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. The A2780/T cells were divided into blank 
group,empty group,small interfering RNA (siRNA) XIAP group and 
siRNA-non-specific group. The expression of XIAP mRNA and protein of four groups 
were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Apoptotic rate of these groups with 
addition of paclitaxel at the concentrations of 0 ng/mL,1 000 ng/mL,1 500 
ng/mL,2 000 ng/mL and 2 500 ng/mL were detected by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: After the treatments on A2780 and A2780/T cells with the different 
concentrations of paclitaxel,the inhibition rate of A2780 cells were gradually 
increased with the increased paclitaxel concentrations (P<0.05),while there were 
no obvious differences in A2780/T cells (P>0.05). After the treatment on these 
cells with paclitaxel at the concentration of 100 ng/mL,the expression of XIAP 
mRNA was lower than that non-treatment with paclitaxelin A2780 cells 
(P<0.05),and the expression of XIAP mRNA in the A2780/T cells were no 
statistical significance between the treatment group and non-treatment group 
with paclitaxel (P>0.05). However,the expression of A2780/T cells'XIAP mRNA and 
protein treated with paclitaxel were higher than A2780 cells' (P<0.05). The 
expression of XIAP mRNA and protein in siRNA-XIAP group was lower than those of 
other groups (P<0.05). The apoptotic rate of siRNA-XIAP group was higher than 
those of other groups treated with the paclitaxel at concentrations of 2 000 
ng/mL and 2 500 ng/mL (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: XIAP's high expression on mRNA and protein was correlated with 
ovarian cancer paclitaxel-resistance,specific siRNA can promote cell apoptosis 
by reducing the expression of XIAP,and increase the sensitivity of 
drug-resistant cancer cells to paclitaxel.
