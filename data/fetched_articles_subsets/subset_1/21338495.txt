BACKGROUND: The mammalian DNA-damage response (DDR) has evolved to protect 
genome stability and maximize cell survival following DNA-damage. One of the key 
regulators of the DDR is p53, itself tightly regulated by MDM2. Following 
double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), mediators including ATM are recruited to the 
site of DNA-damage. Subsequent phosphorylation of p53 by ATM and ATM-induced 
CHK2 results in p53 stabilization, ultimately intensifying transcription of 
p53-responsive genes involved in DNA repair, cell-cycle checkpoint control and 
apoptosis.
METHODS: In the current study, we investigated the stabilization and activation 
of p53 and associated DDR proteins in response to treatment of human colorectal 
cancer cells (HCT116p53+/+) with the MDM2 antagonist, Nutlin-3.
RESULTS: Using immunoblotting, Nutlin-3 was observed to stabilize p53, and 
activate p53 target proteins. Unexpectedly, Nutlin-3 also mediated 
phosphorylation of p53 at key DNA-damage-specific serine residues (Ser15, 20 and 
37). Furthermore, Nutlin-3 induced activation of CHK2 and ATM - proteins 
required for DNA-damage-dependent phosphorylation and activation of p53, and the 
phosphorylation of BRCA1 and H2AX - proteins known to be activated specifically 
in response to DNA damage. Indeed, using immunofluorescent labeling, Nutlin-3 
was seen to induce formation of γH2AX foci, an early hallmark of the DDR. 
Moreover, Nutlin-3 induced phosphorylation of key DDR proteins, initiated cell 
cycle arrest and led to formation of γH2AX foci in cells lacking p53, whilst 
γH2AX foci were also noted in MDM2-deficient cells.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first solid evidence showing a 
secondary role for Nutlin-3 as a DDR triggering agent, independent of p53 
status, and unrelated to its role as an MDM2 antagonist.
