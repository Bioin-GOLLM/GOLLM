Combined and complex dystonias are heterogeneous movement disorders combining 
dystonia with other motor and/or systemic signs. Although we are beginning to 
understand the diverse molecular causes of these disease entities, clinical 
pattern recognition and conventional genetic workup achieve an etiological 
diagnosis only in a minority of cases. Our goal was to provide a window into the 
variable genetic origins and distinct clinical patterns of combined/complex 
dystonia more broadly. Between August 2016 and January 2017, we applied 
whole-exome sequencing to a cohort of nine patients with varied combined and/or 
complex dystonic presentations, being on a diagnostic odyssey. Bioinformatics 
analyses, co-segregation studies, and sequence-interpretation algorithms were 
employed to detect causative mutations. Comprehensive clinical review was 
undertaken to define the phenotypic spectra and optimal management strategies. 
On average, we observed a delay in diagnosis of 23 years before whole-exome 
analysis enabled determination of each patient's genetic defect. Whereas 
mutations in ACTB, ATP1A3, ADCY5, and SGCE were associated with particular 
phenotypic clues, trait manifestations arising from mutations in PINK1, MRE11A, 
KMT2B, ATM, and SLC6A1 were different from those previously reported in 
association with these genes. Apart from improving counseling for our entire 
cohort, genetic findings had actionable consequences on preventative measures 
and therapeutic interventions for five patients. Our investigation confirms 
unique genetic diagnoses, highlights key clinical features and phenotypic 
expansions, and suggests whole-exome sequencing as a first-tier diagnostic for 
combined/complex dystonia. These results might stimulate independent teams to 
extend the scope of agnostic genetic screening to this particular phenotypic 
group that remains poorly characterized through existing studies.
