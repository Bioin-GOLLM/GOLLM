Our understanding of the genus Natrinema is presently limited due to the lack of 
available genetic tools. Auxotrophic markers have been widely used to construct 
genetic systems in bacteria and eukaryotes and in some archaeal species. Here, 
we isolated four auxotrophic mutants of Natrinema sp. J7-2, via 
1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitroso-guanidin mutagenesis, and designated them as J7-2-1, 
J7-2-22, J7-2-26, and J7-2-52, respectively. The mutant phenotypes were 
determined to be auxotrophic for leucine (J7-2-1), arginine (J7-2-22 and 
J7-2-52), and lysine (J7-2-26). The complete genome and the biosynthetic 
pathways of amino acids in J7-2 identified that the auxotrophic phenotype of 
three mutants was due to gene mutations in leuB (J7-2-1), dapD (J7-2-26), and 
argC (J7-2-52). These auxotrophic phenotypes were employed as selectable makers 
to establish a transformation method. The transformation efficiencies were 
determined to be approximately 10(3) transformants per Âµg DNA. And strains 
J7-2-1 and J7-2-26 were transformed into prototrophic strains with the wild type 
genomic DNA, amplified fragments of the corresponding genes, or the integrative 
plasmids carrying the corresponding genes. Additionally, exogenous genes, bgaH 
or amyH gene, were expressed successfully in J7-2-1. Thus, we have developed a 
genetic manipulation system for the Natrinema genus based on the isolated 
auxotrophic mutants of Natrinema sp. J7-2.
