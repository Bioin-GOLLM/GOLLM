In their foraging behavior octopuses rely on arm search movements outside the 
visual field of the eyes. In these movements the environment is explored 
primarily by the suckers that line the entire length of the octopus arm. In this 
study, for the first time, we report the complete characterization of a 
light-sensing molecule, Ov-GRK1, in the suckers, skin and retina of Octopus 
vulgaris. We sequenced the O. vulgaris GRK1 gene, defining a phylogenetic tree 
and performing a 3D structure model prediction. Furthermore, we found 
differences in relative mRNA expression in different sucker types at several arm 
levels, and localized it through in situ hybridization. Our findings suggest 
that the suckers in octopus arms are much more multimodal than was previously 
shown, adding the potential for light sensing to the already known mechanical 
and chemical sensing abilities.
