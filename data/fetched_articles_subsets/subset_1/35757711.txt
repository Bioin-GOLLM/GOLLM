Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-activated macrophages restrain the replication of 
intracellular parasites and disrupt the integrity of vacuolar pathogens. The 
growth of the less virulent type II strain of Toxoplasma gondii (such as ME49) 
was strongly inhibited by IFN-γ-activated murine macrophages. However, the 
mechanism of resistance is poorly understood. Immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) as 
well as guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) contributed to this antiparasitic 
effect. Previous studies showed the cassette of autophagy-related proteins 
including Atg7, Atg3, and Atg12-Atg5-Atg16L1 complex, plays crucial roles in the 
proper targeting of IFN-γ effectors onto the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) 
membrane of Toxoplasma gondii and subsequent control of parasites. TgCDPK3 is a 
calcium dependent protein kinase, located on the parasite periphery, plays a 
crucial role in parasite egress. Herein, we show that the less virulent strain 
CDPK3 (ME49, type II) can enhance autophagy activation and interacts with host 
autophagy proteins Atg3 and Atg5. Infection with CDPK3-deficient ME49 strain 
resulted in decreased localization of IRGs and GBPs around PV membrane. In vitro 
proliferation and plaque assays showed that CDPK3-deficient ME49 strain 
replicated significantly more quickly than wild-type parasites. These data 
suggested that TgCDPK3 interacts with the host Atg3 and Atg5 to promote the 
localization of IRGs and GBPs around PV membrane and inhibits the intracellular 
proliferation of parasites, which is beneficial to the less virulent strain of 
Toxoplasma gondii long-term latency in host cells.
