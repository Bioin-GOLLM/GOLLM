PURPOSE: Targeted next-generation sequencing of DNA has become more widely used 
in the management of patients with lung adenocarcinoma; however, no clear 
mitogenic driver alteration is found in some cases. We evaluated the incremental 
benefit of targeted RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in the identification of gene 
fusions and MET exon 14 (METex14) alterations in DNA sequencing (DNAseq) 
driver-negative lung cancers.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Lung cancers driver negative by MSK-IMPACT underwent 
further analysis using a custom RNAseq panel (MSK-Fusion). Tumor mutation burden 
(TMB) was assessed as a potential prioritization criterion for targeted RNAseq.
RESULTS: As part of prospective clinical genomic testing, we profiled 2,522 lung 
adenocarcinomas using MSK-IMPACT, which identified 195 (7.7%) fusions and 119 
(4.7%) METex14 alterations. Among 275 driver-negative cases with available 
tissue, 254 (92%) had sufficient material for RNAseq. A previously undetected 
alteration was identified in 14% (36/254) of cases, 33 of which were actionable 
(27 in-frame fusions, 6 METex14). Of these 33 patients, 10 then received matched 
targeted therapy, which achieved clinical benefit in 8 (80%). In the 32% 
(81/254) of DNAseq driver-negative cases with low TMB [0-5 mutations/Megabase 
(mut/Mb)], 25 (31%) were positive for previously undetected gene fusions on 
RNAseq, whereas, in 151 cases with TMB >5 mut/Mb, only 7% were positive for 
fusions (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted RNAseq assays should be used in all cases that appear 
driver negative by DNAseq assays to ensure comprehensive detection of actionable 
gene rearrangements. Furthermore, we observed a significant enrichment for 
fusions in DNAseq driver-negative samples with low TMB, supporting the 
prioritization of such cases for additional RNAseq.See related commentary by
