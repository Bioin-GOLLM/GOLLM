Activating mutations in KIT have been identified in melanomas of acral and 
mucosal types and in those arising in chronically sun-damaged skin. Until now, 
KIT has been considered an oncogenic driver and a potential therapeutic target. 
However, data presented by Dhal et al. show that in cutaneous melanomas the KIT 
promoter is a target for hypermethylation, leading to its downregulation. Their 
observations suggest that signaling pathways downstream of KIT may have distinct 
and opposing roles in the pathogenesis of melanoma subtypes. This will have 
important implications for the use of KIT inhibitors in treating melanomas.
