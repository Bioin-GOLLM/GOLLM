Alternative splicing (AS) has a critical role in tumor progression and 
prognosis. Our study aimed to investigate pancreatic cancer-specific AS events 
using RNA-seq data, gaining systematic insights into potential prognostic 
predictors. We downloaded 10,623 genes with 45,313 pancreatic cancer-specific AS 
events from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and SpliceSeq database. Cox 
univariate analyses of overall survival suggested there was a remarkable 
association between 6,711 AS events and overall survival in pancreatic cancer 
patients (P < 0.05). The area under the curves (AUC) of the receiver operator 
characteristic curves (ROC) of risk score was 0.89 for final prognostic 
predictor. Results indicated that AS events of DAZAP1, RBM4, ESRP1, QKI, and SF1 
were significantly associated with overall survival. The results of FunRich 
showed that transcription factors KLF7, GABPA, and SP1 were the most highly 
related to survival-associated AS genes. Furthermore, using DriverDBv2, we 
identified 13 driver genes associated with survival-associated AS events, 
including TP53 and CDC27. Thus, we concluded that the aberrant AS patterns in 
pancreatic cancer patients might serve as prognostic predictors.
