In the title compound, [Mn(2)(C(12)H(6)O(4))(2)(C(10)H(14)N(4))(H(2)O)](n) or 
[Mn(2)(1,4-ndc)(2)(L)(H(2)O)](n), where 1,4-ndc is 
naphthalene-1,4-dicarboxyl-ate and L is 1,1'-(butane-1,4-di-yl)diimidazole, the 
coordination polyhedron around each Mn(II) atom is distorted octa-hedral. The 
water mol-ecule and the L ligand are situated across a twofold rotation axis. 
The Mn(II) atoms are bridged by 1,4-ndc and L ligands, forming a 
three-dimensional network. O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds are observed within the network.
