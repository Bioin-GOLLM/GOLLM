Epileptic seizures constitute a significant comorbidity of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), which are recapitulated in transgenic mouse models of amyloidogenesis. 
Here, we sought to evaluate the potential role of tau pathology regarding 
seizure occurrence. To this end, we performed intra-hippocampal 
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and PTZ (pentylenetetrazol) seizure 
threshold tests in THY-Tau22 transgenic mice of AD-like tau pathology. We 
demonstrate that despite a lack of spontaneous epileptiform activity in Tau22 
mice, the animals display increased PTZ-induced seizure susceptibility and 
mortality. The increased propensity for induced seizures in THY-Tau22 mutants 
correlates with astrogliosis and increased expression of adenosine kinase, 
consistent with increased network excitability. These data support an impact of 
tau pathology toward AD-associated seizures and suggest that tau pathology may 
contribute to seizure generation in AD independent of Aβ pathology.
