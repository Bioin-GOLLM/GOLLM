BACKGROUND: Psoralea Fructus (PF), the dried and ripe fruit of Psoralea 
corylifolia exhibits an anti-cancer activity. However, the molecular mechanisms 
by which PF inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells have not been elucidated 
in detail. Cyclin D1 and CDK4 are important regulatory proteins in cell growth 
and are overexpressed in many cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the 
molecular mechanism of PF on the downregulation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 level.
METHODS: Cell growth was evaluated by MTT assay. The effect of PF on cyclin D1 
and CDK4 expression was evaluated by Western blot or RT-PCR.
RESULTS: PF suppressed the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cell lines 
such as HCT116 (IC50: 45.3 ± 1.2 μg/ml), SW480 (IC50: 37.9 ± 1.6 μg/ml), LoVo 
(IC50: 23.3 ± 1.9 μg/ml μg/ml) HT-29 (IC50 value: 40.7 ± 1.5 μg/ml). PF induced 
decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4. However, the mRNA 
expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 did not be changed by PF; rather it suppressed 
the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 via the proteasomal degradation. In cyclin 
D1 degradation, we found that T286 of cyclin D1 play a pivotal role in 
PF-mediated cyclin D1 degradation. Subsequent experiments with several kinase 
inhibitors suggest that PF-mediated degradation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 is 
dependent on ERK1/2 and/or GSK3β.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PF has potential to be a candidate for the 
development of chemoprevention or therapeutic agents for human colorectal 
cancer.
