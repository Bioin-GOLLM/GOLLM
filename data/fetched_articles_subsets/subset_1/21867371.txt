Mitochondrial disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting from 
primary dysfunction of the respiratory chain. Muscle tissue is highly 
metabolically active, and therefore myopathy is a common element of the clinical 
presentation of these disorders, although this may be overshadowed by central 
neurological features. This review is aimed at a general medical and neurologist 
readership and provides a clinical approach to the recognition, investigation, 
and treatment of mitochondrial myopathies. Emphasis is placed on practical 
management considerations while including some recent updates in the field.
