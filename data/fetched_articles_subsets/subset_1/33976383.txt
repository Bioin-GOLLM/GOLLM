The formation and persistence of negative pain-related expectations by classical 
conditioning remain incompletely understood. We elucidated behavioural and 
neural correlates involved in the acquisition and extinction of negative 
expectations towards different threats across sensory modalities. In two 
complementary functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in healthy humans, 
differential conditioning paradigms combined interoceptive visceral pain with 
somatic pain (study 1) and aversive tone (study 2) as exteroceptive threats. 
Conditioned responses to interoceptive threat predictors were enhanced in both 
studies, consistently involving the insula and cingulate cortex. Interoceptive 
threats had a greater impact on extinction efficacy, resulting in disruption of 
ongoing extinction (study 1), and selective resurgence of interoceptive CS-US 
associations after complete extinction (study 2). In the face of multiple 
threats, we preferentially learn, store, and remember interoceptive danger 
signals. As key mediators of nocebo effects, conditioned responses may be 
particularly relevant to clinical conditions involving disturbed interoception 
and chronic visceral pain.
