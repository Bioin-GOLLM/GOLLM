Recent advances in consortium-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have 
highlighted the involvement of common genetic variants in autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD), but our understanding of their etiologic roles, especially the 
interplay with rare variants, is incomplete. In this work, we introduce an 
analytical framework to quantify the transmission disequilibrium of genetically 
regulated gene expression from parents to offspring. We applied this framework 
to conduct a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) on 7,805 ASD 
proband-parent trios, and replicated our findings using 35,740 independent 
samples. We identified 31 associations at the transcriptome-wide significance 
level. In particular, we identified POU3F2 (p = 2.1E-7), a transcription factor 
mainly expressed in developmental brain. Gene targets regulated by POU3F2 showed 
a 2.7-fold enrichment for known ASD genes (p = 2.0E-5) and a 2.7-fold enrichment 
for loss-of-function de novo mutations in ASD probands (p = 7.1E-5). These 
results provide a novel connection between rare and common variants, whereby ASD 
genes affected by very rare mutations are regulated by an unlinked transcription 
factor affected by common genetic variations.
