AIM: To identify the effects and mechanism of action of Polygonatum kingianum 
(P. kingianum) on dyslipidemia in rats using an integrated untargeted 
metabolomic method.
METHODS: A rat model of dyslipidemia was induced with a high-fat diet (HFD) and 
rats were given P. kingianum [4 g/(kgâ€¢d)] intragastrically for 14 wk. Changes in 
serum and hepatic lipid parameters were evaluated. Metabolites in serum, urine 
and liver samples were profiled using ultra-high performance liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry followed by multivariate statistical analysis 
to identify potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways.
RESULTS: P. kingianum significantly inhibited the HFD-induced increase in total 
cholesterol and triglyceride in the liver and serum. P. kingianum also 
significantly regulated metabolites in the analyzed samples toward normal 
status. Nineteen, twenty-four and thirty-eight potential biomarkers were 
identified in serum, urine and liver samples, respectively. These biomarkers 
involved biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, valine, leucine 
and isoleucine, along with metabolism of tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, 
starch, sucrose, glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, 
nicotinate, nicotinamide and sphingolipid.
CONCLUSION: P. kingianum alleviates HFD-induced dyslipidemia by regulating many 
endogenous metabolites in serum, urine and liver samples. Collectively, our 
findings suggest that P. kingianum may be a promising lipid regulator to treat 
dyslipidemia and associated diseases.
