Small oligomers formed early along human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) 
aggregation is responsible for the cell death in Type II diabetes. The 
epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea extract, was found to inhibit hIAPP 
fibrillation. However, the inhibition mechanism and the conformational 
distribution of the smallest hIAPP oligomer - dimer are mostly unknown. Herein, 
we performed extensive replica exchange molecular dynamic simulations on hIAPP 
dimer with and without EGCG molecules. Extended hIAPP dimer conformations, with 
a collision cross section value similar to that observed by ion mobility-mass 
spectrometry, were observed in our simulations. Notably, these dimers adopt a 
three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and contain the previously reported 
β-hairpin amyloidogenic precursor. We find that EGCG binding strongly blocks 
both the inter-peptide hydrophobic and aromatic-stacking interactions 
responsible for inter-peptide β-sheet formation and intra-peptide interaction 
crucial for β-hairpin formation, thus abolishes the three-stranded β-sheet 
structures and leads to the formation of coil-rich conformations. Hydrophobic, 
aromatic-stacking, cation-π and hydrogen-bonding interactions jointly contribute 
to the EGCG-induced conformational shift. This study provides, on atomic level, 
the conformational ensemble of hIAPP dimer and the molecular mechanism by which 
EGCG inhibits hIAPP aggregation.
