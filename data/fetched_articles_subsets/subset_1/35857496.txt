RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) synthesizes essential and abundant noncoding RNAs 
such as transfer RNAs. Controlling RNAPIII span of activity by accurate and 
efficient termination is a challenging necessity to ensure robust gene 
expression and to prevent conflicts with other DNA-associated machineries. The 
mechanism of RNAPIII termination is believed to be simpler than that of other 
eukaryotic RNA polymerases, solely relying on the recognition of a T-tract in 
the nontemplate strand. Here, we combine high-resolution genome-wide analyses 
and in vitro transcription termination assays to revisit the mechanism of 
RNAPIII transcription termination in budding yeast. We show that T-tracts are 
necessary but not always sufficient for termination and that secondary 
structures of the nascent RNAs are important auxiliary cis-acting elements. 
Moreover, we show that the helicase Sen1 plays a key role in a fail-safe 
termination pathway. Our results provide a comprehensive model illustrating how 
multiple mechanisms cooperate to ensure efficient RNAPIII transcription 
termination.
