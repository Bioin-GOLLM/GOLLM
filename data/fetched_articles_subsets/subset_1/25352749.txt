PURPOSE: We conducted a meta-analysis aiming to evaluate the relationship 
between a common polymorphism (rs2511989 G>A) in the SERPING1 gene and the risk 
of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
METHODS: The PubMed, CISCOM, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, 
Cochrane Library, and CBM databases were searched for relevant articles 
published before November 1, 2013, without any language restrictions. A 
meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 12.0 software. We calculated a crude 
odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) to evaluate the 
relationships under five genetic models.
RESULTS: Seven case-control studies with a total of 7,159 patients with AMD and 
5,797 healthy subjects met the inclusion criteria. The results of our 
meta-analysis showed that the SERPING1 rs2511989 polymorphism might be 
correlated with an increased risk of AMD (G allele versus A allele: OR = 1.09, 
95% CI = 1.03-1.15, p = 0.020; GG + GA versus AA: OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03-1.26, 
p = 0.014; GG versus GA+AA: OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.02-1.19, p = 0.012; GG versus 
AA: OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.07-1.34, p = 0.002; respectively). Results of subgroup 
analysis by ethnicity revealed positive correlations between the SERPING1 
rs2511989 polymorphism and risk of AMD among Caucasians under five genetic 
models (all p<0.05), but not among Asians (all p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis shows that the SERPING1 rs2511989 
polymorphism may have a positive effect on the risk of AMD, especially among 
Caucasians.
