The title mononuclear Ni(II) complex, 
[Ni(C(11)H(11)N(2)O(5))(2)(C(2)H(8)N(2))(2)], is built up by inversion symmetry 
associated with the central Ni atom. The ethyl-enediamine ligands are 
non-planar. The r.m.s. deviation from the mean plane of the five-membered 
Ni-ethyl-amine chelate ring plane is 0.1945 Å. In the crystal structure, complex 
mol-ecules are linked to each other via N-H⋯O and O--H⋯O hydrogen bonding 
through translation symmetry along the b and c axes, resulting in an extended 
supra-molecular network.
