BACKGROUND: TNS2 is a focal adhesions protein and a binding partner for many 
proteins, including the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl. Although TNS2 can bind 
with Axl, the details of their interactions have not been elucidated. TNS2 is 
involved in IRS-1 signaling pathway. In this study, we confirmed the 
relationship between TNS2 expression and the expression of Axl, IRS-1, PDK1 and 
Glut4 in pancreatic cancer patients.
METHODS: The expression levels of TNS2, Axl, IRS-1, PDK1 and Glut4 in human 
cancer cells were measured by Western blot and/or IP-Western blot assays. Paired 
samples of pancreatic cancer and non-cancer tissues were obtained from 33 
patients and were used to construct tissue microarrays. The expression levels of 
these markers in the tissue microarrays were measured by enzyme-linked 
Immunohistochemistry assay, and the relationships were analyzed by Pearson's 
chi-square test and two-tailed t-test analysis.
RESULTS: We demonstrated for the first time that TNS2 is a phosphorylation 
substrate of Axl. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between TNS2 
expression and the expression of Axl, IRS-1, PDK1 and Glut4 in pancreatic cancer 
patients. Based on these results, we suggest that Axl modulates glucose 
metabolism potentially through TNS2 and IRS-1. We hypothesize that there exists 
a novel mechanism whereby Axl binds to and phosphorylates TNS2, releasing TNS2 
from interaction with IRS-1 and resulting in increased stability of IRS-1. The 
two key enzymes of aerobic glycolysis (Glut4 and PDK1) were found to be 
up-regulated by Axl/TNS2/IRS-1 cross-talk and may play a critical role in 
glucose metabolism of cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed for the first time that Axl binds to and 
phosphorylates TNS2 and that Axl/TNS2/IRS-1 cross-talk may potentially play a 
critical role in glucose metabolism of cancer cells.
