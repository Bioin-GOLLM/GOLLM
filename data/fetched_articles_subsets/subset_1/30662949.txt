Polycomb group proteins (PcGs) drive target gene repression and form large 
chromatin domains. In Drosophila, DNA elements known as Polycomb group response 
elements (PREs) recruit PcGs to the DNA. We have shown that, within the 
invected-engrailed (inv-en) Polycomb domain, strong, constitutive PREs are 
dispensable for Polycomb domain structure and function. We suggest that the 
endogenous chromosomal location imparts stability to this Polycomb domain. To 
test this possibility, a 79-kb en transgene was inserted into other chromosomal 
locations. This transgene is functional and forms a Polycomb domain. The 
spreading of the H3K27me3 repressive mark, characteristic of PcG domains, varies 
depending on the chromatin context of the transgene. Unlike at the endogenous 
locus, deletion of the strong, constitutive PREs from the transgene leads to 
both loss- and gain-of function phenotypes, demonstrating the important role of 
these regulatory elements. Our data show that chromatin context plays an 
important role in Polycomb domain structure and function.
