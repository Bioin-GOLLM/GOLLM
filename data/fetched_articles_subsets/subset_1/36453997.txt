G-quadruplexes (G4s) are four-stranded nucleic acid structures formed by the 
stacking of G-tetrads. Here we investigated their formation and function during 
HIV-1 infection. Using bioinformatics and biophysics analyses we first searched 
for evolutionary conserved G4-forming sequences in HIV-1 genome. We identified 
10 G4s with conservation rates higher than those of HIV-1 regulatory sequences 
such as RRE and TAR. We then used porphyrin-based G4-binders to probe the 
formation of the G4s during infection of human cells by native HIV-1. The 
G4-binders efficiently inhibited HIV-1 infectivity, which is attributed to the 
formation of G4 structures during HIV-1 replication. Using a qRT-PCR approach, 
we showed that the formation of viral G4s occurs during the first 2 h 
post-infection and their stabilization by the G4-binders prevents initiation of 
reverse transcription. We also used a G4-RNA pull-down approach, based on a 
G4-specific biotinylated probe, to allow the direct detection and identification 
of viral G4-RNA in infected cells. Most of the detected G4-RNAs contain crucial 
regulatory elements such as the PPT and cPPT sequences as well as the U3 region. 
Hence, these G4s would function in the early stages of infection when the viral 
RNA genome is being processed for the reverse transcription step.
