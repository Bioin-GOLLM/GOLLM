Recent advances in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NET), including the 
combination regimen of capecitabine and temozolomide (CAPTEM), have mostly 
focused on grade 1 and 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET). We undertook a 
retrospective review of 38 patients with advanced NET treated with CAPTEM, 
including patients with non-pancreatic tumors as well as grade 2 and 3 tumors. 
O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression was assessed as a 
predictive biomarker. We found that CAPTEM demonstrated activity in patients 
with all grades and in pNET and non-pNET. Median progression free survival 
(mPFS) was 13.0 months (95% CI: 5.6-17.0) and median overall survival (mOS) 29.3 
months (95% CI 17.7 - 45.3). Among evaluable patients, there were 11 (38%) 
partial responses, 15 (52%) stable disease, and 3 (10%) progressive disease for 
a disease control rate of 90%. A higher rate of partial responses occurred in 
patients whose tumors had low levels of MGMT expression (63%) compared to 
intermediate-high (17%) (p=0.19). Our results show that CAPTEM therapy is active 
in patients with NET including in previously treated patients and in those with 
poorly-differentiated histology. We observed a trend towards increased response 
rate, median PFS, and median OS in patients whose tumors had low MGMT protein 
expression.
