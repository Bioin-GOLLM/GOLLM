In this paper, we propose a coding electromagnetic metasurface (EMMS) with 
integrated broadband tunable radiation and low-scattering performance. 
Anisotropic elements demonstrating opposite phases under x- and y-polarized 
incidence are investigated and coded as "0" and "1" basic elements. These 
elements are then arranged in an optimized layout using a simulated annealing 
algorithm to perform the EMMS. By this means, diffusion scattering is realized 
in a broadband. Meanwhile, when "0" and "1" are fed properly, the coding EMMS 
displays wideband linearly or circularly polarized radiation with symmetric 
profiles. Simulated and experimental results verify that our method offers a 
simple and ingenious way to integrate broadband radiation and low scattering 
into one single-coding EMMS.
