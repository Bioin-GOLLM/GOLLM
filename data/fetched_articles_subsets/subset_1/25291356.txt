PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight recent findings that identify an essential role 
for the cellular degradative pathway of autophagy in governing a balanced 
response to intestinal pathogens and commensals.
RECENT FINDINGS: Following the genetic association of autophagy with 
inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility, increasing evidence indicates that 
this pathway functions in various epithelial lineages to support the intestinal 
barrier. New studies are also revealing that autophagy proteins dictate the 
quality and magnitude of immune responses. Mouse models, in particular, suggest 
that autophagy and inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility genes regulate 
inflammatory responses to viruses, a finding that coincides with an increasing 
appreciation that viruses have intricate interactions with the host and the 
microbiota beyond the obvious host-pathogen relationship.
SUMMARY: Autophagy and other immunological or stress response pathways intersect 
in mucosal immunity to dictate the response to pathogenic and commensal agents. 
The development of novel treatment strategies, as well as prognostic and 
diagnostic tools for gastrointestinal disorders, will be greatly facilitated by 
a deeper understanding of these interactions at the cell type and 
microbe-specific manner, which includes less appreciated components of the 
microbiota, such as eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses.
