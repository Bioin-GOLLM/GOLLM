Group II introns are mobile genetic elements that self-splice and retrotranspose 
into DNA and RNA. They are considered evolutionary ancestors of the spliceosome, 
the ribonucleoprotein complex essential for pre-mRNA processing in higher 
eukaryotes. Over a 20-year period, group II introns have been characterized 
first genetically, then biochemically, and finally by means of X-ray 
crystallography. To date, 17 crystal structures of a group II intron are 
available, representing five different stages of the splicing cycle. This review 
provides a framework for classifying and understanding these new structures in 
the context of the splicing cycle. Structural and functional implications for 
the spliceosome are also discussed.
