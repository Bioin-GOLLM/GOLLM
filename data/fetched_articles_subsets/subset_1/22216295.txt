BACKGROUND: Numerous studies in Chinese populations have evaluated the 
association between the A-6G and A-20C polymorphisms in the promoter region of 
angiotensinogen gene and hypertension. However, the results remain conflicting. 
We carried out a meta-analysis for these associations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Case-control studies in Chinese and English publications 
were identified by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI, Wanfang, CBM, and VIP 
databases. The random-effects model was applied for dichotomous outcomes to 
combine the results of the individual studies. We finally selected 24 studies 
containing 5932 hypertensive patients and 5231 normotensive controls. Overall, 
we found significant association between the A-6G polymorphism and the decreased 
risk of hypertension in the dominant genetic model (AA+AG vs. GG: P=0.001, 
OR=0.71, 95%CI 0.57-0.87, P(heterogeneity)=0.96). The A-20C polymorphism was 
significantly associated with the increased risk for hypertension in the allele 
comparison (C vs. A: P=0.03, OR=1.14, 95%CI 1.02-1.27, P(heterogeneity)=0.92) 
and recessive genetic model (CC vs. CA+AA: P=0.005, OR=1.71, 95%CI 1.18-2.48, 
P(heterogeneity)=0.99). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant 
association was also found among Han Chinese for both A-6G and A-20C 
polymorphisms. A borderline significantly decreased risk of hypertension between 
A-6G and Chinese Mongolian was seen in the allele comparison (A vs. G: P=0.05, 
OR=0.79, 95%CI 0.62-1.00, P(heterogeneity)=0.84).
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicated significant association between 
angiotensinogen promoter polymorphisms and hypertension in the Chinese 
populations, especially in Han Chinese.
