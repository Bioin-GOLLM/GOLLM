OBJECTIVE: Toll-like receptors (TLR) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
arthritis. We investigated the role of functional variants of TLR in the disease 
phenotype and severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: All patients from a longterm observational inception cohort (n = 319) 
were genotyped for 22 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in TLR2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 
8, and 9 using multiplex assays. Clinical characteristics including sex, age at 
disease onset, rheumatoid factor (RF), and shared epitope positivity and disease 
activity score and radiological progression were taken into account. Genotypes 
were analyzed for association with Disease Activity Scores (DAS28) and joint 
damage (Rau scores) at 3 and 6 years.
RESULTS: After Bonferroni correction, there was a moderate association between 
RF positivity and TLR8-rs5741883. No other TLR variant was significantly 
associated with any RA clinical characteristics.
CONCLUSION: Using a large inception cohort and strict statistical evaluation, we 
could not identify an association between functional TLR variants and RA 
phenotype and disease severity. This suggests the functional TLR variants do not 
play a major role in RA phenotype and disease severity.
