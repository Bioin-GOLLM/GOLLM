OBJECTIVE: Sepsis is a complex and serious medical condition resulting from the 
activation of an innate host response to infections. The etiology of sepsis is 
complex and can be influenced by genetic susceptibility. The purpose of the 
present study was to investigate a possible association of Rho-kinase 1 (ROCK1) 
gene polymorphism with sepsis in a Turkish population.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 100 unrelated patients with sepsis and 100 
healthy controls. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes from 
EDTA-containing blood using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. ROCK1 gene rs35996865 
and rs112130712 (Lys1054Arg) polymorphisms were analyzed in genomic DNA using 
the LightCycler 480 II real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in allele and genotype 
frequencies for ROCK1 gene rs35996865 polymorphism between the patients with 
sepsis and control group (p>0.05). Additionally, no association was detected 
between the rs35996865 polymorphism and mortality in the patient group. No 
polymorphism was detected with ROCK1 gene rs112130712 (Lys1054Arg) in our study 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that there is no marked association between the 
rs35996865 polymorphism and sepsis. Therefore, these results suggest that ROCK1 
gene rs35996865 polymorphism is not risk factor for the development of sepsis in 
the Turkish population.
