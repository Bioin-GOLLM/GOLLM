A genome-wide association study among Europeans related polymorphisms of the 
Toll-like receptor (TLR) locus at 4p14 and the FcÎ³ receptor 2a locus at 1q23.3 
to Helicobacter pylori serologic status. We replicated associations of 4p14 but 
not 1q23.3 with anti-Helicobacter pylori antibodies in 1402 Finnish males. 
Importantly, our analysis clarified that the phenotype affected by 4p14 is 
quantitative level of these antibodies rather than association with 
seropositivity per se. In addition, we annotated variants at 4p14 as expression 
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associated with TLR6/10 and FAM114A1. Our 
findings suggest that 4p14 polymorphisms are linked to host immune response to 
H. pylori infection but not to its acquisition.
