Previous studies have shown that the functional 511C/T polymorphism in the 
IL-1beta-gene may be implicated in the susceptibility for schizophrenia. 
Moreover, recent studies suggested that IL-1 participates in the progression of 
lung disease in smokers, which are overrepresented in schizophrenia. We aimed to 
investigate the possible relationship between the IL-1beta-511C/T polymorphism 
and smoking behavior in schizophrenia versus healthy controls in a Chinese 
population. The IL-1beta-511C/T polymorphism was genotyped in 638 male patients 
with chronic schizophrenia (smoker/never-smoker = 486/152) and 469 male controls 
(smoker/never-smoker = 243/226). The cigarettes smoked per day, the Heaviness of 
Smoking Index (HSI) and the Fagerstrom Test for nicotine dependence (FTND) were 
assessed. Patients were also rated on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
(PANSS). The results showed no significant differences in genotype and allele 
distribution between patients and controls, and between smokers and 
never-smokers in either the patient or control group. However, in patients, 
smokers with the C/C genotype had significantly higher HSI (p < 0.005) and FTND 
(p < 0.05) scores than smokers with the T/T genotype, without significant 
differences in controls. Furthermore, there was a linear positive correlation 
between the number of C alleles and the HSI (p < 0.005) in patients. Our 
findings suggest that the IL-1beta-511C/T polymorphism may not be related to 
schizophrenia or smoking status in Chinese individuals, but may affect the 
severity of nicotine dependence among male smokers with schizophrenia.
