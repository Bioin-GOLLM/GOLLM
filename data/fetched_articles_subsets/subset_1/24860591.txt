BACKGROUND: The activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is subject to 
genetic variation. Loss-of-function alleles are associated with various degrees 
of myelosuppression after treatment with thiopurine drugs, thus genotype-based 
dosing recommendations currently exist. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
the potential utility of leveraging genomic data from large biorepositories in 
the identification of individuals with TPMT defective alleles.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: TPMT variants were imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project 
reference panel in 87,979 samples from the biobank at The Children's Hospital of 
Philadelphia. Population ancestry was determined by principal component analysis 
using HapMap3 samples as reference. Frequencies of the TPMT imputed alleles, 
genotypes and the associated phenotype were determined across the different 
populations. A sample of 630 subjects with genotype data from Sanger sequencing 
(N = 59) and direct genotyping (N = 583) (12 samples overlapping in the two 
groups) was used to check the concordance between the imputed and observed 
genotypes, as well as the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative 
predictive values of the imputation.
RESULTS: Two SNPs (rs1800460 and rs1142345) that represent three TPMT alleles 
((*)3A, (*)3B, and (*)3C) were imputed with adequate quality. Frequency for the 
associated enzyme activity varied across populations and 89.36-94.58% were 
predicted to have normal TPMT activity, 5.3-10.31% intermediate and 0.12-0.34% 
poor activities. Overall, 98.88% of individuals (623/630) were correctly imputed 
into carrying no risk alleles (553/553), heterozygous (45/46) and homozygous 
(25/31). Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of imputation were over 
90% in all cases except for the sensitivity of imputing homozygous subjects that 
was 80.64%.
CONCLUSION: Imputation of TPMT alleles from existing genomic data can be used as 
a first step in the screening of individuals at risk of developing serious 
adverse events secondary to thiopurine drugs.
