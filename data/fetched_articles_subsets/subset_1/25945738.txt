The Golgi complex has a central role in the intracellular sorting of secretory 
proteins. Anterograde transport through the Golgi has been explained by the 
movement of Golgi cisternae, known as cisternal maturation. Because this 
explanation is now appreciated to be incomplete, interest has developed in 
understanding tubules that connect the Golgi cisternae. Here we show that the 
coat protein I (COPI) complex sorts anterograde cargoes into these tubules in 
human cells. Moreover, the small GTPase CDC42 regulates bidirectional Golgi 
transport by targeting the dual functions of COPI in cargo sorting and carrier 
formation. CDC42 also directly imparts membrane curvature to promote COPI tubule 
formation. Our findings further reveal that COPI tubular transport complements 
cisternal maturation in explaining how anterograde Golgi transport is achieved, 
and that bidirectional COPI transport is modulated by environmental cues through 
CDC42.
