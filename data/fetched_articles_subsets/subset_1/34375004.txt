Wounding triggers de novo organogenesis, vascular reconnection and defense 
response but how wound stress evoke such a diverse array of physiological 
responses remains unknown. We previously identified AP2/ERF transcription 
factors, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 (WIND1) and its homologs, WIND2, WIND3 
and WIND4, as key regulators of wound-induced cellular reprogramming in 
Arabidopsis. To understand how WIND transcription factors promote downstream 
events, we performed time-course transcriptome analyses after WIND1 induction. 
We observed a significant overlap between WIND1-induced genes and genes 
implicated in cellular reprogramming, vascular formation and pathogen response. 
We demonstrated that WIND transcription factors induce several reprogramming 
genes to promote callus formation at wound sites. We, in addition, showed that 
WIND transcription factors promote tracheary element formation, vascular 
reconnection and resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. These 
results indicate that WIND transcription factors function as key regulators of 
wound-induced responses by promoting dynamic transcriptional alterations. This 
study provides deeper mechanistic insights into how plants control multiple 
physiological responses after wounding.
