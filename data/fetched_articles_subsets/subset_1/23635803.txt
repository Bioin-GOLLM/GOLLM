OBJECTIVE: Disulfiram is a potential cocaine addiction pharmacotherapy. Since 
dopamine deficiency has been found with cocaine addiction, our objective was to 
examine whether functional variants in the ankyrin repeat and kinase 
domain-containing 1 (ANKK1) and/or the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) genes 
interact with response to treatment with disulfiram.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cocaine and opioid codependent (DSM-IV) patients were 
stabilized on methadone and subsequently randomized into treatment groups - 
disulfiram (250 mg/day, N=31) or placebo (N=37). They were genotyped for ANKK1 
(rs1800497) and DRD2 (rs2283265) polymorphisms, and the data were evaluated for 
an association between a cocaine-free state, as assessed by cocaine-free urine 
samples, and disulfiram treatment. Data were analyzed using repeated measures 
analysis of variance corrected for population structure.
RESULTS: Patients with CT or TT ANKK1 genotypes dropped from 80 to 52% 
cocaine-positive urines on disulfiram (N=13; P≤0.0001), whereas those on placebo 
(N=20) showed no treatment effect. Patients carrying the CC ANKK1 genotype 
showed no effect on treatment with disulfiram (N=18) or placebo (N=17). The 
GT/TT DRD2 genotype group showed a significant decrease in the number of 
cocaine-positive urine samples on disulfiram (N=9; 67-48%; P ≤ 0.0001), whereas 
the GG DRD2 genotype group showed only a marginal decrease (N=23; 84-63%; 
P=0.04). Genotype pattern analysis revealed that individuals carrying at least 
one minor allele in either gene responded better to disulfiram treatment (N=13; 
P ≤ 0.0001) compared with individuals carrying only the major alleles (N=17).
CONCLUSION: A patient's genotype for ANKK1, DRD2, or both, may be used to 
identify individuals for whom disulfiram may be an effective pharmacotherapy for 
cocaine dependence.
