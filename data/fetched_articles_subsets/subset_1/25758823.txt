The spatial organization of the genome within the eukaryotic nucleus is a 
dynamic process that plays a central role in cellular processes such as gene 
expression, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. Condensins are 
conserved multi-subunit protein complexes that contribute to chromosome 
organization by regulating chromosome compaction and homolog pairing. Previous 
work in our laboratory has shown that the Cap-H2 subunit of condensin II 
physically and genetically interacts with the Drosophila homolog of human 
MORF4-related gene on chromosome 15 (MRG15). Like Cap-H2, Mrg15 is required for 
interphase chromosome compaction and homolog pairing. However, the mechanism by 
which Mrg15 and Cap-H2 cooperate to maintain interphase chromatin organization 
remains unclear. Here, we show that Cap-H2 localizes to interband regions on 
polytene chromosomes and co-localizes with Mrg15 at regions of active 
transcription across the genome. We show that co-localization of Cap-H2 on 
polytene chromosomes is partially dependent on Mrg15. We have identified a 
binding motif within Cap-H2 that is essential for its interaction with Mrg15, 
and have found that mutation of this motif results in loss of localization of 
Cap-H2 on polytene chromosomes and results in partial suppression of 
Cap-H2-mediated compaction and homolog unpairing. Our data are consistent with a 
model in which Mrg15 acts as a loading factor to facilitate Cap-H2 binding to 
chromatin and mediate changes in chromatin organization.
