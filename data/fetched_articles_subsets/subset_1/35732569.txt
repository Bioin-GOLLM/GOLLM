Only a small percentage (<1%) of patients with late-stage lung squamous cell 
carcinoma (LUSC) are eligible for targeted therapy. Because PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
signaling, particularly Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase CA (PIK3CA), is 
dysregulated in two-thirds of LUSC, and DNA damage response pathways are 
enriched in LUSC, we tested whether CC-115, a dual mTORC1/2 and DNA-PK 
inhibitor, sensitizes LUSC to chemotherapy. We demonstrate that CC-115 
synergizes with carboplatin in six of 14 NSCLC cell lines, primarily 
PIK3CA-mutant LUSC. Synergy was more common in cell lines that had decreased 
basal levels of activated AKT and DNA-PK, evidenced by reduced P-S473-AKT, 
P-Th308-AKT, and P-S2056-DNA-PKcs. CC-115 sensitized LUSC to carboplatin by 
inhibiting chemotherapy-induced AKT activation and maintaining apoptosis, 
particularly in PIK3CA-mutant cells lacking wild-type (WT) TP53. In addition, 
pathway analysis revealed that enrichments in the IFNα and IFNγ pathways were 
significantly associated with synergy. In multiple LUSC patient-derived 
xenograft and cell line tumor models, CC-115 plus platinum-based doublet 
chemotherapy significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased overall survival 
as compared with either treatment alone at clinically relevant dosing schedules. 
IHC and immunoblot analysis of CC-115-treated tumors demonstrated decreased 
P-Th308-AKT, P-S473-AKT, P-S235/236-S6, and P-S2056-DNA-PKcs, showing direct 
pharmacodynamic evidence of inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascades. Because 
PI3K pathway and DNA-PK inhibitors have shown toxicity in clinical trials, we 
assessed toxicity by examining weight and numerous organs in PRKDC-WT mice, 
which demonstrated that the combination treatment does not exacerbate the 
clinically accepted side effects of standard-of-care chemotherapy. This 
preclinical study provides strong support for the further investigation of 
CC-115 plus chemotherapy in LUSC.
