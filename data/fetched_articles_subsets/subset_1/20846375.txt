BACKGROUND: Attention deficits belong to the main cognitive symptoms of 
schizophrenia and come along with altered neural activity in previously 
described cerebral networks. Given the high heritability of schizophrenia the 
question arises if impaired function of these networks is modulated by 
susceptibility genes and detectable in healthy risk allele carriers.
METHODS: The present event-related fMRI study investigated the effect of the 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1018381 of the DTNBP1 
(dystrobrevin-binding protein 1) gene on brain activity in 80 subjects while 
performing the attention network test (ANT). In this reaction time task three 
domains of attention are probed simultaneously: alerting, orienting and 
executive control of attention.
RESULTS: Risk allele carriers showed impaired performance in the executive 
control condition associated with reduced neural activity in the left superior 
frontal gyrus [Brodmann area (BA) 9]. Risk allele carriers did not show 
alterations in the alerting and orienting networks.
CONCLUSIONS: BA 9 is a key region of schizophrenia pathology and belongs to a 
network that has been shown previously to be involved in impaired executive 
control mechanisms in schizophrenia. Our results identified the impact of DTNBP1 
on the development of a specific attention deficit via modulation of a left 
prefrontal network.
