Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an inherited disorder of the melanin pigmentary 
system, characterized by a decrease or an absence of melanin in the skin, hair, 
and eyes. Type I (tyrosinase-deficient) OCA results from mutations of the 
tyrosinase (TYR) gene encoding tyrosinase, the enzyme that catalyzes at least 
the first two steps of melanin biosynthesis. We have analyzed the TYR gene in 
three Korean patients with severe type I OCA. Two patients were compound 
heterozygotes for the Arg (CGG) to Gln (CAG) mutation at position 77 and a C 
insertion mutation at position 310. The other was a compound heterozygote for a 
C insertion mutation at position 310 and the Asp (GAT) to Asn (AAT) mutation at 
position 383. These mutations were easily detected by restriction enzyme 
digestion or by SSCP analysis. Such methods of mutation analysis thus provide a 
basis for a screening system for the TYR gene mutations in Korean patients with 
type I OCA.
