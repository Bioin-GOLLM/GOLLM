In the last years, different research groups have made considerable efforts to 
improve the care and use of animals in research. Mice (Mus musculus) are the 
most widely used animal species in research in the European Union and are 
sociable and hierarchical creatures. During experiments, researchers tend to 
individualize males, but no consideration is given to whether this social 
isolation causes them stress. The aim of this study was, therefore, to explore 
whether 4 weeks of social isolation could induce changes in different 
physiological parameters in adult Crl:CD1(ICR) (CD1) males, which may interfere 
with experimental results. Body weight, blood cells, and fecal corticosterone 
metabolites levels were the analyzed parameters. Blood and fecal samples were 
collected at weeks 1 and 4 of the experimental procedure. Four weeks of single 
housing produced a significant time-dependent decrease in monocytes and 
granulocytes. Fecal corticosterone metabolite levels were higher in 
single-housed mice after 1 week and then normalized after 4 weeks of isolation. 
Body weight, red blood cells, and platelets remained unchanged in both groups 
during this period. We can, therefore, conclude that social isolation affects 
some immune and endocrine parameters, and that this should be taken into account 
in the interpretation of research data.
