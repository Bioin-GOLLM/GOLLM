Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive myopathy caused by 
dystrophin mutations. Although respiratory management has improved the prognosis 
of patients with DMD, inevitable progressive cardiomyopathy is a current leading 
cause of premature death. Recently, we showed that a medium-chain triglyceride 
containing ketogenic diet (MCTKD) improves skeletal muscle function and 
pathology in a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited rat model with DMD. In this study, we 
sought to clarify whether MCTKD also improves the cardiomyopathy in these rats. 
DMD rats were fed either the MCTKD or normal diet (ND) from ages of 3 weeks to 
9 months old. Compared with the ND-fed rats, MCTKD-fed rats showed significantly 
prolonged QRS duration, decreased left ventricular fractional shortening, an 
increased heart weight/body weight ratio, and progression of cardiac fibrosis. 
In contrast to our previous study which found that MCTKD improved skeletal 
myopathy, the current study showed unexpected exacerbation of the 
cardiomyopathy. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms 
for these differences and to explore modified dietary options that improve 
skeletal and cardiac muscles simultaneously.
