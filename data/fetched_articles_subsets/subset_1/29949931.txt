Deregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase mesenchymal epithelial transition 
factor (MET) has been implicated in several human cancers and is an attractive 
target for small molecule drug discovery. Herein, a series of 
6,7-disubstituted-4-phenoxyquinoline derivatives bearing pyridazinone 
derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their enzymatic 
inhibitory activity against c-Met kinase and cellular potency against A549, 
HepG2, and MCF-7 cell lines. Eight of them are equal to more active than 
positive control Foretinib against one or more cell lines and enzyme. The most 
promising compound 53 showed superior activity to Foretinib, which possessed 
excellent c-Met kinase inhibition on a singledigital nanomolar level (IC50 = 0.6 
nM), and cancer cells of A549 (IC50 = 0.003 µM), HepG2 (IC50 = 0.49 µM) and 
MCF-7 cells (IC50 = 0.006 µM). The result of AO single staining indicated that 
compound 53 could induce remarkable apoptosis of HepG2 cell.
