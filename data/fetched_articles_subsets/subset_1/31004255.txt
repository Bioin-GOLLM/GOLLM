The site of protein folding and maturation for the majority of proteins that are 
secreted, localized to the plasma membrane or targeted to endomembrane 
compartments is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is essential that proteins 
targeted to the ER are properly folded in order to carry out their function, as 
well as maintain protein homeostasis, as accumulation of misfolded proteins 
could lead to the formation of cytotoxic aggregates. Because protein folding is 
an error-prone process, the ER contains protein quality control networks that 
act to optimize proper folding and trafficking of client proteins. If a protein 
is unable to reach its native state, it is targeted for ER retention and 
subsequent degradation. The protein quality control networks of the ER that 
oversee this evaluation or interrogation process that decides the fate of 
maturing nascent chains is comprised of three general types of families: the 
classical chaperones, the carbohydrate-dependent system, and the thiol-dependent 
system. The cooperative action of these families promotes protein quality 
control and protein homeostasis in the ER. This review will describe the 
families of the ER protein quality control network and discuss the functions of 
individual members.
