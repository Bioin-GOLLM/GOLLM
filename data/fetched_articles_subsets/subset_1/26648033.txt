There are two regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (rSNPs) at the 
beginning of the second intron of the mouse K-ras gene that are strongly 
associated with lung cancer susceptibility. We performed functional analysis of 
three SNPs (rs12228277: T greater than A, rs12226937: G greater than A, and 
rs61761074: T greater than G) located in the same region of human KRAS. We found 
that rs12228277 and rs61761074 result in differential binding patterns of lung 
nuclear proteins to oligonucleotide probes corresponding two alternative 
alleles; in both cases, the transcription factor NF-Y is involved. G greater 
than A substitution (rs12226937) had no effect on the binding of lung nuclear 
proteins. However, all the nucleotide substitutions under study showed 
functional effects in a luciferase reporter assay. Among them, rs61761074 
demonstrated a significant correlation with allele frequency in non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). Taken together, the results of our study suggest that a T 
greater than G substitution at nucleotide position 615 in the second intron of 
the KRAS gene (rs61761074) may represent a promising genetic marker of NSCLC.
