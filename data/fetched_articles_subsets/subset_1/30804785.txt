Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most serious diseases and now 
becomes a major public health problem in the world. The pathogenesis of 
depression remains poorly understood. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) belong to 
a large family of growth factors that are involved in brain development during 
early periods as well as maintenance and repair throughout adulthood. In recent 
years, studies have found a correlation between the members of the FGF system 
and depression. These signaling molecules may be expected to be biomarkers for 
the diagnosis and prognosis of MDD, and may provide new drug targets for the 
treatment of depression. Here, we reviewed the correlation between some members 
of the FGF system and depression.
