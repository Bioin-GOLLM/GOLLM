BACKGROUND: ECG global electrical heterogeneity (GEH) is associated with sudden 
cardiac death. We hypothesized that a genome-wide association study would 
identify genetic loci related to GEH.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We tested genotyped and imputed variants in black (N=3057) 
and white (N=10 769) participants in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities) study and CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study). GEH (QRS-T angle, sum 
absolute QRST integral, spatial ventricular gradient magnitude, elevation, 
azimuth) was measured on 12-lead ECGs. Linear regression models were constructed 
with each GEH variable as an outcome, adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass 
index, study site, and principal components to account for ancestry. GWAS 
identified 10 loci that showed genome-wide significant association with GEH in 
whites or joint ancestry. The strongest signal (rs7301677, near TBX3) was 
associated with QRS-T angle (white standardized β+0.16 [95% CI 0.13-0.19]; 
P=1.5×10-26), spatial ventricular gradient elevation (+0.11 [0.08-0.14]; 
P=2.1×10-12), and spatial ventricular gradient magnitude (-0.12 [95% CI -0.15 to 
-0.09]; P=5.9×10-15). Altogether, GEH-SNPs explained 1.1% to 1.6% of GEH 
variance. Loci on chromosomes 4 (near HMCN2), 5 (IGF1R), 11 (11p11.2 region 
cluster), and 7 (near ACTB) are novel ECG phenotype-associated loci. Several 
loci significantly associated with gene expression in the left ventricle (HMCN2 
locus-with HMCN2; IGF1R locus-with IGF1R), and atria (RP11-481J2.2 locus-with 
expression of a long non-coding RNA and NDRG4).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified 10 genetic loci associated with ECG GEH. Replication 
of GEH GWAS findings in independent cohorts is warranted. Further studies of 
GEH-loci may uncover mechanisms of arrhythmogenic remodeling in response to 
cardiovascular risk factors.
