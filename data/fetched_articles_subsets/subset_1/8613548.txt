Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor is a key molecule in hemostasis as its 
abnormality leads to bleeding disorders. Two isoforms of the human TXA2 receptor 
have been cloned; one from placenta and the other from endothelium, here 
referred to as TXR alpha and TXR beta, respectively. These isoforms differ only 
in their carboxyl-terminal tails. We report that both isoforms are present in 
human platelets. The two isoforms expressed in cultured cells show similar 
ligand binding characteristics and phospholipase C (PLC) activation but 
oppositely regulate adenylyl cyclase activity; TXR alpha activates adenylyl 
cyclase, while TXR beta inhibits it. The Arg60 to Leu mutant of TXR alpha, which 
has been shown to impair PLC activation (Hirata, T., A. Kakizuka, F. Ushikubi, 
I. Fuse, M. Okuma, and S. Narumiya. 1994. J. Clin. Invest. 94: 1662-1667), also 
impairs adenylyl cyclase stimulation, whereas that of TXR beta retains its 
activity to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. These findings suggest that the pathway 
linked to adenylyl cyclase inhibition might be involved in some of the 
TXA2-induced platelet responses such as shape change and phospholipase A2 
activation which remain unaffected in the patients with this mutation.
