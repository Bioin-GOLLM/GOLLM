BACKGROUND: Several reports suggested association between the T allele of the 
endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism (eNOS) Glu298Asp (G --> T at 
nucleotide 894, exon 7) with essential hypertension (EHT). Findings, however are 
not uniform. In this case-control study, we determined the prevalence and 
distribution of the above polymorphism and their relationship with the disease 
to elucidate the association of this polymorphism with the risk and 
pathophysiology of EHT in the Asian Indians and significance of T allele in this 
context.
METHODS: Two hundred normal controls and 226 patients with EHT from Delhi and 
surrounding areas were recruited for the investigation. Venous blood samples 
were used for genotyping. Genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: The data suggested higher prevalence of GT+TT genotypes in patients as 
compared to the controls and association of T allele with EHT [p<0.001, odds 
ratio at 95% CI, 2.10 (1.34-3.28)].
CONCLUSIONS: Asian Indians of this region with T allele may be at higher risk of 
EHT.
