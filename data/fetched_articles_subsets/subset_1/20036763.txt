We tested the hypotheses that: (1) long-term facilitation (LTF) following acute 
intermittent hypoxia (AIH) varies among three inbred rat strains: Fischer 344 
(F344), Brown Norway (BN) and Lewis rats and (2) ventral cervical spinal levels 
of genes important for phrenic LTF (pLTF) vary in association with pLTF 
magnitude. Lewis and F344, but not BN rats exhibited significant increases in 
phrenic and hypoglossal burst amplitude 60min post-AIH that were significantly 
greater than control experiments without AIH, indicating strain differences in 
phrenic (98%, 56% and 20%, respectively) and hypoglossal LTF (66%, 77% and 5%, 
respectively). Ventral spinal 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA and protein levels were 
higher in F344 and Lewis versus BN, suggesting that higher 5-HT(2A) receptor 
levels are associated with greater pLTF. More complex relationships were found 
for 5-HT(7), BDNF and TrkB mRNA. BN had higher 5-HT(7) and TrkB mRNA versus 
F344; BN and Lewis had higher BDNF mRNA levels versus F344. Genetic variations 
in serotonergic function may underlie strain differences in AIH-induced pLTF.
