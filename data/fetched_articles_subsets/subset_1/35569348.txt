Long QT syndrome (LQT) is an inherited primary arrhythmic disorder characterized 
by prolonged QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram and life-threatening 
arrhythmia. In this study, a skin biopsy was obtained from an LQT type 2 (LQT2) 
patient, who carried a nonsense mutation (c.1956C > A; p.Y652X) in the potassium 
voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2) gene. The skin fibroblasts 
were reprogrammed by non-integrated Sendai viral method to generate a 
patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line. The generated iPSC 
line showed typical embryonic stem cell-like morphology, exhibited normal 
karyotype, expressed pluripotency markers, and was capable to differentiate into 
three germ layers.
