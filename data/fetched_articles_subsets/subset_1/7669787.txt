Porphobilinogen deaminase from Escherichia coli becomes progressively more 
susceptible to inactivation by the thiophilic reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) as 
the catalytic cycle proceeds through the enzyme-intermediate complexes ES, ES2, 
ES3, and ES4. Site-directed mutagenesis of potentially reactive cysteines has 
been used to identify cysteine-134 as the key residue that becomes modified by 
the reagent and leads to inactivation. Since cysteine-134 is buried at the 
interface between domains 2 and 3 of the E. coli deaminase molecule, the 
observations suggest that a stepwise conformational change occurs between these 
domains during each stage of tetrapyrrole assembly. Interestingly, mutation of 
the invariant active-site cysteine-242 to serine leads to an enzyme with up to a 
third of the catalytic activity found in the wild-type enzyme. Electrospray mass 
spectrometry indicates that serine can substitute for cysteine as the 
dipyrromethane cofactor attachment site.
