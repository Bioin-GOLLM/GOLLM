Continuous de novo fatty acid synthesis is a common feature of cancer that is 
required to meet the biosynthetic demands of a growing tumor. This process is 
controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), an 
attractive but traditionally intractable drug target. Here we provide genetic 
and pharmacological evidence that in preclinical models ACC is required to 
maintain the de novo fatty acid synthesis needed for growth and viability of 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We describe the ability of ND-646-an 
allosteric inhibitor of the ACC enzymes ACC1 and ACC2 that prevents ACC subunit 
dimerization-to suppress fatty acid synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Chronic 
ND-646 treatment of xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC 
inhibited tumor growth. When administered as a single agent or in combination 
with the standard-of-care drug carboplatin, ND-646 markedly suppressed lung 
tumor growth in the Kras;Trp53-/- (also known as KRAS p53) and Kras;Stk11-/- 
(also known as KRAS Lkb1) mouse models of NSCLC. These findings demonstrate that 
ACC mediates a metabolic liability of NSCLC and that ACC inhibition by ND-646 is 
detrimental to NSCLC growth, supporting further examination of the use of ACC 
inhibitors in oncology.
