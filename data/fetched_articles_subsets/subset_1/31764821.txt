BACKGROUND: There have been several case-control studies to assess the 
relationship between the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) T + 869C 
(rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) gene polymorphism and lung cancer in recent 
years; however, the results remain controversial. In this study, we investigated 
the potential correlation between the TGF-β1 T + 869C/C-509T polymorphism and 
increased risk of lung cancer through meta-analysis.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library database, Embase, PubMed, Web of 
Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Wanfang Data 
Information Service platform to identify relevant case-control studies in strict 
accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The odds ratio (OR) and 
its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to evaluate the correlation 
between TGF-β1 gene polymorphism and lung tumor risk. Sensitivity analysis and 
Egger test were used to evaluate the stability of the results and possible 
publication bias.
RESULTS: A total of 8 studies, with 3680 patients and 4018 controls, were 
included. The meta-analysis revealed that there was no conspicuous correlation 
between the TGF-β1 T + 869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) variant and lung 
cancer in the overall population. For TGF-β1 C-509T, a significant decreased 
risk was identified in patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the 
analysis stratified by disease (TT vs CT + CC: P = .02, OR = 0.49, 95% CI 
0.27-0.90). However, for TGF-β1 T + 869C, subgroup analysis showed no 
correlation between the T + 869C polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility in 
patients with NSCLC. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no distinct 
association was observed between T + 869C (rs1982073)/C-509T (rs1800469) 
polymorphism and lung cancer susceptibility in the Asian and Caucasian groups. 
Moreover, no significant association was found in the analysis of groups 
stratified by age, sex, and smoking history.
CONCLUSION: The TGF-β1 T + 869C (rs1982073) and C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphisms 
are not implicated in lung cancer susceptibility in the overall population. 
However, our analysis indicated that the C-509T (rs1800469) polymorphism 
decreases the risk of lung cancer in patients with NSCLC.
