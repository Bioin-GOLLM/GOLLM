BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is still a major 
health issue in Indonesia. In recent years, the appearance of drug 
resistance-associated mutations has reduced the effectiveness of Antiretroviral 
Therapy (ART). We conducted genotypic studies, including the detection of drug 
resistance-associated mutations (from first-line regimen drugs), on HIV-1 genes 
derived from infected individuals in Maumere, West Nusa Tenggara. Maumere, a 
transit city in West Nusa Tenggara, which has a high HIV-1 transmission rate.
METHOD: We collected 60 peripheral blood samples from 53 ART-experienced and 7 
ART-naive individuals at TC Hillers Hospital, Maumere between 2014 and 2015. The 
amplification and a sequencing analysis of pol genes encoding protease (the PR 
gene) and reverse transcriptase (the RT gene) as well as the viral env and gag 
genes were performed. HIV-1 subtyping and the detection of drug 
resistance-associated mutations were then conducted.
RESULTS: Among 60 samples, 46 PR, 31 RT, 30 env, and 20 gag genes were 
successfully sequenced. The dominant HIV-1 subtype circulating in Maumere was 
CRF01_AE. Subtype B and recombinant viruses containing gene fragments of 
CRF01_AE, subtypes A, B, C, and/or G were also identified as minor populations. 
The major drug resistance-associated mutations, M184V, K103N, Y188L, and M230I, 
were found in the RT genes. However, no major drug resistance-associated 
mutations were detected in the PR genes.
CONCLUSION: CRF01_AE was the major HIV-1 subtype prevalent in Maumere. The 
appearance of drug resistance-associated mutations found in the present study 
supports the necessity of monitoring the effectiveness of ART in Maumere.
