Cells in the human retina must rapidly adapt to constantly changing visual 
stimuli. This fast adaptation to varying levels and wavelengths of light helps 
to regulate circadian rhythms and allows for adaptation to high levels of 
illumination, thereby enabling the rest of the visual system to remain 
responsive. It has been shown that retinal microRNA (miRNA) molecules play a key 
role in regulating these processes. However, despite extensive research using 
various model organisms, light-regulated miRNAs in human retinal cells remain 
unknown. Here, we aim to characterize these miRNAs. We generated 
light-responsive human retinal organoids that express miRNA families and 
clusters typically found in the retina. Using an in-house developed 
photostimulation device, we identified a subset of light-regulated miRNAs. 
Importantly, we found that these miRNAs are differentially regulated by distinct 
wavelengths of light and have a rapid turnover, highlighting the dynamic and 
adaptive nature of the human retina.
