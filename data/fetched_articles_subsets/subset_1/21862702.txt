This review integrates historical biochemical and modern genetic findings that 
underpin our understanding of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) dyslipidemias 
that bear on human disease. These range from life-threatening conditions of 
infancy through severe coronary heart disease of young adulthood, to indolent 
disorders of middle- and old-age. We particularly focus on the biological 
aspects of those gene mutations and variants that impact on sterol absorption 
and hepatobiliary excretion via specific membrane transporter systems (NPC1L1, 
ABCG5/8); the incorporation of dietary sterols (MTP) and of de novo synthesized 
lipids (HMGCR, TRIB1) into apoB-containing lipoproteins (APOB) and their release 
into the circulation (ANGPTL3, SARA2, SORT1); and receptor-mediated uptake of 
LDL and of intestinal and hepatic-derived lipoprotein remnants (LDLR, APOB, 
APOE, LDLRAP1, PCSK9, IDOL). The insights gained from integrating the wealth of 
genetic data with biological processes have important implications for the 
classification of clinical and presymptomatic diagnoses of traditional LDL 
dyslipidemias, sitosterolemia, and newly emerging phenotypes, as well as their 
management through both nutritional and pharmaceutical means.
