Inactivating autosomal recessive mutations in fibroblast growth factor 23 
(FGF23), klotho (KL) and polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminotransferase 3 (GALNT3) 
genes lead to a rare disorder, hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis 
(HFTC). Patients with HFTC present with hyperphosphatemia and tumor like soft 
tissue calcifications. Although 78% of patients develop their first symptoms 
between the ages of 2-13 years, diagnosis is usually delayed until adulthood. 
Some individuals with the same genetic defect develop a condition named 
hyperphosphatemic hyperostosis syndrome. Herein we report two siblings suffering 
from periarticular, warm, hard and tender subcutaneous masses. Subcutaneous 
calcifications were present on X-ray and biopsy results were consistent with 
calcinosis in both patients. Laboratory results showed marked hyperphosphatemia 
and elevated renal tubular phosphate reabsorption rates, normal renal function 
tests and normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Thus, we suspected HFTC and 
performed next generation sequencing for the GALNT3 gene, reported as the most 
frequent cause. A novel homozygote P85Rfs*6 (c.254_255delCT) mutation in GALNT3 
was identified in both siblings. Our report adds two new patients to the 
literature about this rare genetic disease and suggests that small deletions in 
the GALNT3 gene may be related with HFTC phenotype.
