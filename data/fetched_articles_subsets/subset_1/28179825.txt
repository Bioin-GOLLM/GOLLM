I review the development of numerical evolution codes for general relativity 
based upon the characteristic initial value problem. Progress is traced from the 
early stage of 1D feasibility studies to 2D axisymmetric codes that accurately 
simulate the oscillations and gravitational collapse of relativistic stars and 
to current 3D codes that provide pieces of a binary black hole spacetime. Cauchy 
codes have now been successful at simulating all aspects of the binary black 
hole problem inside an artificially constructed outer boundary. A prime 
application of characteristic evolution is to eliminate the role of this 
artificial outer boundary via Cauchy-characteristic matching, by which the 
radiated waveform can be computed at null infinity. Progress in this direction 
is discussed.
