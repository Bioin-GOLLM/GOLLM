The breakdown of toll-like receptor (TLR) tolerance results in tissue damage, 
and hyperactivation of the TLRs and subsequent inflammatory consequences have 
been implicated as risk factors for more severe forms of disease and poor 
outcomes from various diseases including COVID-19 and metabolic (dysfunction) 
associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Here we provide evidence that membrane 
bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 7 (MBOAT7) is a negative regulator of 
TLR signalling. MBOAT7 deficiency in macrophages as observed in patients with 
MAFLD and in COVID-19, alters membrane phospholipid composition. We demonstrate 
that this is associated with a redistribution of arachidonic acid toward 
proinflammatory eicosanoids, induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and remodelling of the accessible 
inflammatory-related chromatin landscape culminating in macrophage inflammatory 
responses to TLRs. Activation of MBOAT7 reverses these effects. These outcomes 
are further modulated by the MBOAT7 rs8736 (T) MAFLD risk variant. Our findings 
suggest that MBOAT7 can potentially be explored as a therapeutic target for 
diseases associated with dysregulation of the TLR signalling cascade.
