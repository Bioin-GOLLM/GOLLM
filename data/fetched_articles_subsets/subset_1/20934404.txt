Carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a transcription 
factor whose expression and activity are increased in pancreatic β-cells 
maintained at elevated glucose concentrations. We show here that ChREBP 
inactivation in clonal pancreatic MIN6 β-cells results in an increase in Pdx-1 
expression at low glucose and to a small, but significant, increase in Ins2, GcK 
and MafA gene expression at high glucose concentrations. Conversely, 
adenovirus-mediated over-expression of ChREBP in mouse pancreatic islets results 
in decreases in Pdx-1, MafA, Ins1, Ins2 and GcK mRNA levels. These data suggest 
that strategies to reduce ChREBP activity might protect against β-cell 
dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.
