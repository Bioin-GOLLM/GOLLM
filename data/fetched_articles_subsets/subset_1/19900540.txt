Mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKRP) gene cause limb-girdle muscular 
dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I) as well as other severe muscle disorders, including 
Walker-Warburg syndrome, muscle-eye-brain disease, and congenital muscular 
dystrophy type 1C. The FKRP gene encodes a putative glycosyltransferase, but its 
precise localization and functions have yet to be determined. In the present 
study, we demonstrated that normal FKRP is secreted into culture medium and 
mutations alter the pattern of secretion in CHO cells. L276I mutation associated 
with mild disease phenotype was shown to reduce the level of secretion whereas 
P448L and C318Y mutations associated with severe disease phenotype almost 
abolished the secretion. However, a truncated FKRP mutant protein lacking the 
entire C-terminal 185 amino acids due to the E310X nonsense mutation was able to 
secrete as efficiently as the normal FKRP. The N-terminal signal peptide 
sequence is apparently cleaved from the secreted FKRP proteins. Alteration of 
the secretion pathway by different mutations and spontaneous read-through of 
nonsense mutation may contribute to wide variations in phenotypes associated 
with FKRP-related diseases.
