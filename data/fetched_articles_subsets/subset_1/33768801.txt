Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WDSTS) is an exceptionally rare autosomal dominant 
syndrome with considerable phenotypical variation. Clinical features include 
dysmorphic facial and skeletal features, growth deficiency, developmental delay, 
hypertrichosis cubiti and various dental features. We present a 7-year-old 
female with premature exfoliation of primary teeth and premature eruption of 
permanent teeth.
