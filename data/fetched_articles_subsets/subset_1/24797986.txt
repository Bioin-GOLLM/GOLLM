PURPOSE: In this report, we summarise data on BRCA1 gene analysis in Latvia to 
characterise criteria of genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer 
susceptibility.
MATERIAL/METHODS: Analysis by SSCP/HD, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry or DNA 
sequencing was used for mutation detection. Mutations identified were confirmed 
by direct DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Out of 1068 breast and 231 ovarian cancer patients from different 
families: 58 carried the c.5266dupC and 43 carried the c.4035delA mutations. 
Every 4th patient in our study did not report cancer in the family. The breast 
cancer was diagnosed earlier in carriers of the c.5266dupC than in carriers of 
the c.4035delA (p=0.003). The incidence of breast or ovarian cancer does not 
differ among the 2 mutation carriers in our patient group. The nature of the 
c.5266dupC mutation might be more deleterious.
CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the screening of 4 founder BRCA1 mutations in all 
breast and ovarian cancer patients in Latvia at diagnosis of disease regardless 
of family history or age. The BRCA1 screening can be carried out efficiently 
using the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry mutation detection method developed in the 
Biomedical Research and Study Centre (Riga, Latvia).
