BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and its 
progressive form steatohepatitis (NASH), represent a genetically and 
phenotypically diverse entity for which there is no approved therapy, making it 
imperative to define the spectrum of pathways contributing to its pathogenesis. 
Rare variants in genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins cause lipodystrophy 
with early-onset NAFLD/NASH; we hypothesized that common variants in nuclear 
envelope-related genes might also contribute to hepatic steatosis and NAFLD.
METHODS: Using hepatic steatosis as the outcome of interest, we performed an 
association meta-analysis of nuclear envelope-related coding variants in three 
large discovery cohorts (N >120,000 participants), followed by phenotype 
association studies in large validation cohorts (N >600,000) and functional 
testing of the top steatosis-associated variant in cell culture.
RESULTS: A common protein-coding variant, rs6461378 (SUN1 H118Y), was the top 
steatosis-associated variant in our association meta-analysis (p <0.001). In 
ancestrally distinct validation cohorts, rs6461378 associated with histologic 
NAFLD and with NAFLD-related metabolic traits including increased serum fatty 
acids, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and decreased HDL. 
SUN1 H118Y was subject to increased proteasomal degradation relative to 
wild-type SUN1 in cells, and SUN1 H118Y-expressing cells exhibited insulin 
resistance and increased lipid accumulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data support a potential causal role for the 
common SUN1 variant rs6461378 in NAFLD and metabolic disease.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with an 
estimated global prevalence of nearly 30%, is a growing cause of morbidity and 
mortality for which there is no approved pharmacologic therapy. Our data provide 
a rationale for broadening current concepts of NAFLD genetics and 
pathophysiology to include the nuclear envelope, and particularly Sad1 and UNC84 
domain containing 1 (SUN1), as novel contributors to this common liver disease. 
Furthermore, if future studies confirm causality of the common SUN1 H118Y 
variant, it has the potential to become a broadly relevant therapeutic target in 
NAFLD and metabolic disease.
