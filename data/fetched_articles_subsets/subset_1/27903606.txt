Although the growth factor progranulin was discovered more than two decades ago, 
the functional receptor remains elusive. Here, we discovered that EphA2, a 
member of the large family of Ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases, is a functional 
signaling receptor for progranulin. Recombinant progranulin bound with high 
affinity to EphA2 in both solid phase and solution. Interaction of progranulin 
with EphA2 caused prolonged activation of the receptor, downstream stimulation 
of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt, and promotion of capillary 
morphogenesis. Furthermore, we found an autoregulatory mechanism of progranulin 
whereby a feed-forward loop occurred in an EphA2-dependent manner that was 
independent of the endocytic receptor sortilin. The discovery of a functional 
signaling receptor for progranulin offers a new avenue for understanding the 
underlying mode of action of progranulin in cancer progression, tumor 
angiogenesis, and perhaps neurodegenerative diseases.
