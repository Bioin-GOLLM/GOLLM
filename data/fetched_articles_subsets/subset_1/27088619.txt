PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate polymorphisms in DNA repair 
genes as potential predictive factors among Chinese cervical cancer patients.
METHODS: A total of 72 patients with cervical carcinoma, who received 
cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy and whose responses were evaluated by Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, were included. The association between 
response to chemoradiotherapy and the genotypes for 29 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in 25 DNA repair genes were analyzed.
RESULTS: A minor allele of SNP rs9350 in the exonuclease 1 gene was associated 
with a better response rate, regardless of age and tumor stage (odds ratio, 
8.316; p=0.002).
CONCLUSION: SNP rs9350 in the exonuclease 1 gene is involved in inter-individual 
differences in the response to cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy, in patients 
with cervical carcinoma.
