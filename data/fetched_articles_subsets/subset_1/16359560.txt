BACKGROUND: In silico analyses based on sequence similarities with animal 
channels have identified a large number of plant genes likely to encode ion 
channels. The attempts made to characterise such putative plant channels at the 
functional level have most often relied on electrophysiological analyses in 
classical expression systems, such as Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells. In a 
number of cases, these expression systems have failed so far to provide 
functional data and one can speculate that using a plant expression system 
instead of an animal one might provide a more efficient way towards functional 
characterisation of plant channels, and a more realistic context to investigate 
regulation of plant channels.
RESULTS: With the aim of developing a plant expression system readily amenable 
to electrophysiological analyses, we optimised experimental conditions for 
preparation and transformation of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts and engineered 
expression plasmids, that were designed to allow subcellular localisation and 
functional characterisation of ion channels eventually in presence of their 
putative (possibly over-expressed) regulatory partners. Two inward K+ channels 
from the Shaker family were functionally expressed in this system: not only the 
compliant KAT1 but also the recalcitrant AKT1 channel, which remains 
electrically silent when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or in mammalian cells.
CONCLUSION: The level of endogenous currents in control protoplasts seems 
compatible with the use of the described experimental procedures for the 
characterisation of plant ion channels, by studying for instance their 
subcellular localisation, functional properties, structure-function 
relationships, interacting partners and regulation, very likely in a more 
realistic context than the classically used animal systems.
