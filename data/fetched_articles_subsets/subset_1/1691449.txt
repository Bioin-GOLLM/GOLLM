Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common recessive lethal genetic disorder, affecting 1 
in 1,600 Caucasians. The disease causes defective regulation of chloride-ion 
transport in exocrine cells. Although in all CF families the disease is linked 
to a locus on chromosome 7q31, there is clinical heterogeneity in the severity 
of the disease and the age at which it is diagnosed. CF is caused by mutations 
in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. A three-nucleotide 
deletion (delta F508) causing the loss of a phenylalanine residue in the tenth 
exon of the CFTR gene has been found on 70% of CF chromosomes. We have now 
characterized a CF family in which neither parent of the affected individual 
carries the common mutation, and identified a two-nucleotide insertion in the CF 
allele of the mother. The mutation introduces a termination codon in exon 13 of 
the CFTR gene at residue 821, and is predicted to result in the production of a 
severely truncated nonfunctional protein.
