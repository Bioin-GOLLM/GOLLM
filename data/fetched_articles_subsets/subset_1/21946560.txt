Eukaryotic cells respond to DNA damage by activating checkpoint signalling 
pathways. Checkpoint signals are transduced by a protein kinase cascade that 
also requires non-kinase mediator proteins. One such mediator is the 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dpb11 protein, which binds to and activates the apical 
checkpoint kinase, Mec1. Here, we show that a ternary complex of Dpb11, Mec1 and 
another key mediator protein Rad9 is required for efficient Rad9 phosphorylation 
by Mec1 in vitro, and for checkpoint activation in vivo. Phosphorylation of Rad9 
by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) on two key residues generates a binding site 
for tandem BRCT repeats of Dpb11, and is thereby required for Rad9 recruitment 
into the ternary complex. Checkpoint signalling via Dpb11, therefore, does not 
efficiently occur during G1 phase when CDK is inactive. Thus, Dpb11 coordinates 
checkpoint signal transduction both temporally and spatially, ensuring the 
initiator kinase is specifically activated in proximity of one of its critical 
substrates.
