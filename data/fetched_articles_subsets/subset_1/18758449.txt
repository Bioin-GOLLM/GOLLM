More effective therapies are urgently needed against hepatitis C virus (HCV), a 
major cause of viral hepatitis. We used in vitro protein expression and 
microfluidic affinity analysis to study RNA binding by the HCV transmembrane 
protein NS4B, which plays an essential role in HCV RNA replication. We show that 
HCV NS4B binds RNA and that this binding is specific for the 3' terminus of the 
negative strand of the viral genome with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 
approximately 3.4 nM. A high-throughput microfluidic screen of a compound 
library identified 18 compounds that substantially inhibited binding of RNA by 
NS4B. One of these compounds, clemizole hydrochloride, was found to inhibit HCV 
RNA replication in cell culture that was mediated by its suppression of NS4B's 
RNA binding, with little toxicity for the host cell. These results yield new 
insight into the HCV life cycle and provide a candidate compound for 
pharmaceutical development.
