Genomics involving tens of thousands of genes is a complex system determining 
phenotype. An interesting and vital issue is how to integrate highly sparse 
genetic genomics data with a mass of minor effects into a prediction model for 
improving prediction power. We find that the deep learning method can work well 
to extract features by transforming highly sparse dichotomous data to 
lower-dimensional continuous data in a non-linear way. This may provide benefits 
in risk prediction-associated genotype data. We developed a multi-stage strategy 
to extract information from highly sparse binary genotype data and applied it 
for cancer prognosis. Specifically, we first reduced the size of binary 
biomarkers via a univariable regression model to a moderate size. Then, a 
trainable auto-encoder was used to learn compact features from the reduced data. 
Next, we performed a LASSO problem process to select the optimal combination of 
extracted features. Lastly, we applied such feature combination to real cancer 
prognostic models and evaluated the raw predictive effect of the models. The 
results indicated that these compressed transformation features could better 
improve the model's original predictive performance and might avoid an 
overfitting problem. This idea may be enlightening for everyone involved in 
cancer research, risk reduction, treatment, and patient care via integrating 
genomics data.
