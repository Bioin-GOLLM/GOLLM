BACKGROUND: In recent years, reduction of nuclear power generation and the use 
of coal-fired power for filling the power supply gap might have increased the 
risk of lung cancer. This study aims to explore the most effective treatment for 
different stages of lung cancer patients.
METHODS: We searched databases to investigate the treatment efficacy of lung 
cancer. The network meta-analysis was used to explore the top three effective 
therapeutic strategies among all collected treatment methodologies.
RESULTS: A total of 124 studies were collected from 115 articles with 171,757 
participants in total. The results of network meta-analyses showed that the best 
top three treatments: (1) in response rate, for advanced lung cancer were 
Targeted + Targeted, Chemo + Immuno, and Targeted + Other Therapy with 
cumulative probabilities 82.9, 80.8, and 69.3%, respectively; for non-advanced 
lung cancer were Chemoradio + Targeted, Chemoradi + Immuno, and Chemoradio + 
Other Therapy with cumulative probabilities 69.0, 67.8, and 60.7%, respectively; 
(2) in disease-free control rate, for advanced lung cancer were Targeted + 
Others, Chemo + Immuno, and Targeted + Targeted Therapy with cumulative 
probabilities 93.4, 91.5, and 59.4%, respectively; for non-advanced lung cancer 
were Chemo + Surgery, Chemoradio + Targeted, and Surgery Therapy with cumulative 
probabilities 80.1, 71.5, and 43.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The therapeutic strategies with the best effectiveness will be 
different depending on the stage of lung cancer patients.
