Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF-1) is a sequence-specific and cell 
type-specific transcription factor in regulation of the human T cell receptor Î± 
enhancer. It has been shown the minor groove of DNA can bind the intrinsic 
disordered LEF. To get an insight into the mechanism of how the intrinsic 
disordered LEF specifically recognizes DNA, we have performed explicit-solvent 
multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the specific recognition 
between DNA and LEF. Room-temperature MD simulations suggest that the disordered 
C-tails of LEF have nonspecific and specific interactions with the minor groove 
of DNA. Kinetic analysis of high-temperature MD simulations shows that bound and 
apo-states unfold via a two-state process. The specific binding of the 
disordered C-tails of LEF can accelerate the formation of a complex. Gly38Ala 
and Met11Gly mutant simulations show that electrostatic interactions between DNA 
and LEF significantly decrease. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) P test analysis 
illustrates that the specific recognition between DNA and LEF might follow an 
induced-fit mechanism. Furthermore, these methods can be used for the research 
of specific recognition between DNA and other intrinsic disordered proteins.
