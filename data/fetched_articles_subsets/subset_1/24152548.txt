The central role of protein S12 in organizing the structure of the decoding site 
of the ribosome.

The ribosome decodes mRNA by monitoring the geometry of codon-anticodon 
base-pairing using a set of universally conserved 16S rRNA nucleotides within 
the conformationally dynamic decoding site. By applying single-molecule FRET and 
X-ray crystallography, we have determined that conditional-lethal, 
streptomycin-dependence mutations in ribosomal protein S12 interfere with tRNA 
selection by allowing conformational distortions of the decoding site that 
impair GTPase activation of EF-Tu during the tRNA selection process. Distortions 
in the decoding site are reversed by streptomycin or by a second-site suppressor 
mutation in 16S rRNA. These observations encourage a refinement of the current 
model for decoding, wherein ribosomal protein S12 and the decoding site 
collaborate to optimize codon recognition and substrate discrimination during 
the early stages of the tRNA selection process.
