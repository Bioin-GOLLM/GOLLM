BACKGROUND: the present study evaluates genetic polymorphisms of three 
glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1, GSTT1and GSTP1) in patients with synchronous 
malignant colorectal tumors and the association of synchronous colorectal 
cancers with other cancers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: from 420 patients with a colorectal cancer admitted to our 
hospital between 2005-2012, we selected for genetic analysis 20 patients with 
multiple synchronous malignant colorectal tumors and 9 patients with 
asynchronous association of colorectal cancer with another cancer. We searched 
for GST genotypes, comparing the results with controls.
RESULTS: the genetic analysis was possible only in 19 patients with colorectal 
synchronous cancers and 9 patients with asynchronous association of colorectal 
cancer with another cancer; we found a statistically significant difference for 
null GSTM1 genotype frequency between these patients and the control group; we 
found no differences regarding the frequency of null GSTT1 genotype and 
Ile105Val polymorphism of GSTP1 in patients with synchronous cancers compared 
with the control group.
CONCLUSION: in our study we found the null GSTM1 genotype as a risk factor for 
multiple colorectal synchronous cancers and for an association of synchronous 
colorectal with other cancers
