OBJECTIVES: Oxidative stress has been implicated in the outcome of 
atherosclerotic plaques. However, at present, no data are available neither on 
the degree of plaque protein sulfhydryl groups oxidation nor on its relationship 
with plaque vulnerability. We investigated the entity of protein-SH oxidative 
modifications, focusing on low molecular weight thiols adduction, in human 
carotid plaque extracts in relation to plaque stability/instability.
METHODS: Plaque stability/instability was histologically assessed. The extent of 
protein-SH oxidative modifications was established by a differential proteomic 
approach on fluorescein-5-maleimide-labeled plaque extracts and corresponding 
plasma samples from 48 endarterectomized patients. The analysis on protein 
thiolation was performed by capillary zone electrophoresis.
RESULTS: We observed a higher protein-SH oxidation of both plasma-derived and 
topically expressed proteins in unstable plaques, partly due to higher levels of 
S-thiolation. Conversely, in plasma, none of the investigated parameters 
discriminated among patients with stable and unstable plaques.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the presence of a more pronounced oxidative 
environment in unstable plaques. Identifying specific oxidative modifications 
and understanding their effects on protein function could provide further 
insight into the relevance of oxidative stress in atherosclerosis.
