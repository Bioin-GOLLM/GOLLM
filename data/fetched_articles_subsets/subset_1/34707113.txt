Cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), produced by 
cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulates the production of type I interferons 
(IFN). Here we show that cGAMP activates DNA damage response (DDR) signaling 
independently of its canonical IFN pathways. Loss of cGAS dampens DDR signaling 
induced by genotoxic insults. Mechanistically, cGAS activates DDR in a 
STING-TBK1-dependent manner, wherein TBK1 stimulates the autophosphorylation of 
the DDR kinase ATM, with the consequent activation of the CHK2-p53-p21 signal 
transduction pathway and the induction of G1 cell cycle arrest. Despite its 
stimulatory activity on ATM, cGAMP suppresses homology-directed repair (HDR) 
through the inhibition of polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation), in which cGAMP 
reduces cellular levels of NAD+; meanwhile, restoring NAD+ levels abrogates 
cGAMP-mediated suppression of PARylation and HDR. Finally, we show that cGAMP 
also activates DDR signaling in invertebrate species lacking IFN (Crassostrea 
virginica and Nematostella vectensis), suggesting that the genome surveillance 
mechanism of cGAS predates metazoan interferon-based immunity.
