Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common form of focal, 
pharmacoresistant epilepsy in adults and is often associated with hippocampal 
sclerosis. Here, we established the efficacy of optogenetic and electrical 
low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in interfering with seizure generation in a 
mouse model of MTLE. Specifically, we applied LFS in the sclerotic hippocampus 
to study the effects on spontaneous subclinical and evoked generalized seizures. 
We found that stimulation at 1 Hz for 1 hr resulted in an almost complete 
suppression of spontaneous seizures in both hippocampi. This seizure-suppressive 
action during daily stimulation remained stable over several weeks. Furthermore, 
LFS for 30 min before a pro-convulsive stimulus successfully prevented seizure 
generalization. Finally, acute slice experiments revealed a reduced efficacy of 
perforant path transmission onto granule cells upon LFS. Taken together, our 
results suggest that hippocampal LFS constitutes a promising approach for 
seizure control in MTLE.
