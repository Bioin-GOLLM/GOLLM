The STK11/LKB1 is a tumor suppressor involved in metabolism and cell motility. 
In BRAFV600E melanoma, STK11 is inactivated by extracellular signal‒regulated 
kinase and RSK, preventing it from binding and activating adenosine 
monophosphate-activated protein kinase and promoting melanoma cell 
proliferation. Although STK11 mutations occur in 5‒10% of cutaneous melanoma, 
few functional studies have been performed. By knocking out STK11 with 
CRISPR/Cas9 in two human BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines, we found that STK11 
loss reduced the sensitivity to a BRAF inhibitor. More strikingly, STK11 loss 
led to an increased invasive phenotype in both three-dimensional spheroids and 
in vivo zebrafish xenograft models. STK11 overexpression consistently reversed 
the invasive phenotype. Interestingly, STK11 knockout increased invasion also in 
an NRAS-mutant melanoma cell line. Furthermore, although STK11 was expressed in 
primary human melanoma tumors, its expression significantly decreased in 
melanoma metastases, especially in brain metastases. In the STK11-knockout 
cells, we observed increased activating phosphorylation of signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3/5 and FAK. Using inhibitors of signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3/5 and FAK, we reversed the invasive phenotype 
in both BRAF- and NRAS-mutated cells. Our findings confirm an increased invasive 
phenotype on STK11 inactivation in BRAF- and NRAS-mutant cutaneous melanoma that 
can be targeted by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5 and FAK 
inhibition.
