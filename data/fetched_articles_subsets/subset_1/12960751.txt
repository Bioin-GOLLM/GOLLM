OBJECTIVE: The present study was aimed at examining the association between the 
-G308A tumour necrosis factor-alpha gene polymorphism and major depressive 
disorder (MDD) in the Korean population.
METHODS: One hundred and eight in-patients with MDD and 125 healthy controls 
participated in this study. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.
RESULTS: Genotype and allele distributions in patients with MDD (P=0.024 and 
P=0.0125, respectively), were significantly different from those of the 
controls. In particular, subjects with MDD had an increased frequency of the 
TNF2 (A) allele.
CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that the -G308A tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha gene polymorphism may have a potential role for susceptibility to 
MDD in the Korean population.
