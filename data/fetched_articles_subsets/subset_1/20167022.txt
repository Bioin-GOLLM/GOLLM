Pax genes are a group of critical developmental transcriptional regulators in 
both invertebrates and vertebrates, characterized by the presence of a paired 
DNA-binding domain. Pax proteins also often contain an octapeptide motif and a 
C-terminal homeodomain. The genome of Nasonia vitripennis (Hymenoptera) has 
recently become available, and analysis of this genome alongside Apis mellifera 
allowed us to contribute to the phylogeny of this gene family in insects. 
Nasonia, a parasitic wasp, has independently evolved a similar mode of 
development to that of the well-studied Drosophila, making it an excellent model 
system for comparative studies of developmental gene networks. We report the 
characterization of the seven Nasonia Pax genes. We describe their genomic 
organization, and the embryonic expression of three of them, and uncover wider 
conservation of the octapeptide motif than previously described.
