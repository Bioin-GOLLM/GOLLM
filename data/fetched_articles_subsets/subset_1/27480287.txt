BACKGROUND: We report the re-biopsied diagnosis of a patient with anaplastic 
lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK)-positive lung adenocarcinoma 
successfully treated with ceritinib 450 mg/day taken with food following disease 
progression and gastrointestinal intolerance to crizotinib.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year old female patient initially diagnosed with 
ALK-negative lung adenocarcinoma responded to initial standard chemotherapy. The 
patient was subsequently re-tested by next generation sequencing (NGS) and found 
to have ALK EIF2AK3-ALK fusion, and responded to crizotinib, but ultimately 
progressed and showed intolerance to this ALK inhibitor. She was then 
successfully treated with ceritinib 450 mg/day taken with food, has not suffered 
from any further gastrointestinal side-effects, and remains on ceritinib 
treatment after 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Second-line ceritinib treatment, when administered at 450 mg/day 
with food, is both well tolerated and efficacious in a patient with previously 
treated lung adenocarcinoma who had discontinued crizotinib due to disease 
progression and gastrointestinal adverse effects (AEs).
