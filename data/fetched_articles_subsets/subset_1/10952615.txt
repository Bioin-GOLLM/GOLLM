A clinical strain of Escherichia coli (Ec GCE) displayed resistance to 
cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. Susceptibility was not 
restored by the addition of clavulanic acid. Two beta-lactamases with apparent 
pIs of 5.4 and 6.4 were identified; the beta-lactamase with a pI of 6.4 was 
transferred by conjugation and associated with a 40-kb plasmid. Analysis of the 
nucleotide sequence showed a new ampC beta-lactamase gene that is closely 
related to those encoding the FOX-3, FOX-2, and FOX-1 beta-lactamases but whose 
product has four novel amino acid mutations, at positions 11 (M-->T), 43 
(A-->E), 233 (V-->A), and 280 (Y-->H). This first cephamycinase from Spain was 
named FOX-4.
