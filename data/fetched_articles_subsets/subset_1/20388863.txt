BACKGROUND: Although medication nonadherence may contribute to inadequate 
diabetes control, adherence is not routinely measured. Persistence, the 
continuous refill of medications, is one metric that could be integrated into 
clinical care if associated with glycemic control.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the association of persistence levels (non-, good, 
overpersistence) with hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C) over 1 year in newly medicated 
diabetics in the Veterans Administration.
METHODS: Eligible veterans were > or =18 years and first filled a prescription 
for oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 
2002. The date the OHA was first dispensed was defined as the baseline date. 
Subjects must have filled at least 1 prescription for any drug, but no diabetes 
medications, during the 12 months preceding the baseline date. Persistence was 
measured in days supply of medication over 365 days and defined as non- (<0.80), 
good (> or =0.8-1.10), and over- (>1.10) persistence. The main outcome measure 
was achieving goal A1C (< or =7.0%) after 1 year.
RESULTS: A total of 56,181 veterans were included. Veterans were male (97%) and 
white (67%) with comorbid hypertension (58%) and hyperlipidemia (40%). Median 
age was 63 years, while median baseline A1C was 7.7%. Fifty-two percent of 
patients had good persistence; 25% were overpersistent. Good persistence was 
associated with achieving goal A1C (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.09). The 
association of overpersistence with the same outcome (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.94 to 
0.97) was lower than good persistence, but higher than nonpersistence (RR 0.93; 
95% CI 0.92 to 0.94).
CONCLUSIONS: Good persistence was associated with glycemic control. 
Overpersistent patients were common and more likely than nonpersistent patients, 
but less likely than good persisters to attain goal A1C. Estimating these 
different strata of persistence may be useful in identifying patients at risk of 
poor glycemic control.
