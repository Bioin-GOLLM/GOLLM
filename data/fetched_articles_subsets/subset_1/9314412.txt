Essential hypertension has been linked to a highly polymorphic marker at the 
angiotensinogen locus, and association with a polymorphism in this locus has 
been found in some populations. We tested the hypothesis that these same 
polymorphic markers are linked to essential hypertension in Mexican Americans. 
The data comprised all the affected relative pairs in 46 extended families 
chosen at random from a low-income barrio in San Antonio. Specifically, we 
searched for linkage by testing for excessive marker alleles shared identical by 
descent (IBD) among hypertensive relative pairs. When women taking oral 
contraceptives or hormones were excluded, the affected relative pairs shared a 
significant excess of alleles IBD for the highly heterozygous GT repeat 
polymorphism (P=.038) and were marginally significant for the M235T variant 
(P=.079), which has a much lower heterozygosity (0.43 versus 0.85 for the GT 
repeat). We also assayed plasma levels of angiotensinogen and, using likelihood 
methods, found no significant association (P=.43) between plasma levels of 
angiotensinogen and M235T genotypes. These results support the linkage of 
essential hypertension to the angiotensinogen locus but do not indicate a 
specific role for the M235T variant.
