Background Mental health conditions (MHCs) are associated with poor outcomes in 
patients with atrial fibrillation. However, persistence of oral anticoagulation 
therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and MHCs is unknown. We aimed to 
evaluate the effect of MHCs on the persistence of direct oral anticoagulant 
(DOAC) use in patients with atrial fibrillation based on a nationwide cohort. 
Methods and Results The nationwide registry-based FinACAF (Finnish 
Anticoagulation in Atrial Fibrillation) cohort included 67 503 patients with 
incident atrial fibrillation and indication for permanent oral anticoagulation 
(CHA2DS2-VASc score >1 in men and >2 in women) starting DOAC therapy between 
2011 and 2018. MHCs of interest were depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety 
disorder, schizophrenia, and composite of any MHC. The main outcome was 
nonpersistence of DOAC use, defined as the first 120-day period without DOAC 
purchases after drug initiation. The mean age of the patients was 
75.3±8.9 years, 53.6% were women, and the prevalence of any MHC was 17.8%. 
Persistence after 1 year from DOAC initiation was 79.3% in patients without MHCs 
and 77.2% in patients with any MHC, and after 2 years were 64.4% and 60.6%, 
respectively (P<0.001). Higher incidence of nonpersistence to DOACs was observed 
in all MHC categories: adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios, 1.16 (95% CI, 
1.11-1.21) for any MHC, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.22-1.42) for depression, 1.44 (95% CI, 
1.15-1.80) for bipolar disorder, 1.25 (95% CI, 1.11-1.41) for anxiety disorder, 
and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.02-1.64) for schizophrenia. However, patients with only 
anxiety disorder without other MHCs were not at higher risk of nonpersistence. 
Conclusions MHCs are associated with nonpersistence of DOAC use. Registration
