Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several hundred 
loci associated with autoimmune diseases, their mechanistic insights are still 
poorly understood. The human genome is more complex than single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) that are interrogated by GWAS arrays. Apart from SNPs, it 
also comprises genetic variations such as insertions-deletions, copy number 
variations, and somatic mosaicism. Although previous studies suggest that common 
copy number variations do not play a major role in autoimmune disease risk, it 
is possible that certain rare genetic variations with large effect sizes are 
relevant to autoimmunity. In addition, other layers of regulations such as 
gene-gene interactions, epigenetic-determinants, gene and environmental 
interactions also contribute to the heritability of autoimmune diseases. This 
review focuses on discussing why studying these elements may allow us to gain a 
more comprehensive understanding of the aetiology of complex autoimmune traits.
