Acephalic spermatozoa is a very rare disorder of male infertility. Here, in a 
patient from from a consanguineous family, we have identified, by whole-exome 
sequencing, a homozygous mutation (c.G2783A, p.G928D) in the BRDT gene. The gene 
product, BRDT, is a testis-specific protein that is considered an important drug 
target for male contraception. The G928D mutation is in the P-TEFb binding 
domain, which mediates the interaction with transcription elongation factor and 
might affect the transcriptional activities of downstream genes. By 
RNA-sequencing analysis of cells expressing the BRDT mutation, we found the 
p.G928D mutation protein causes mis-regulation of 899 genes compared with BRDT 
wild-type cells. Furthermore, by Gene Ontology analysis, the upregulated genes 
in p.G928D cells were enriched in the processes of intracellular transport, RNA 
splicing, cell cycle and DNA metabolic process, revealing the underlying 
mechanism of the pathology that leads to acephalic spermatozoa.
