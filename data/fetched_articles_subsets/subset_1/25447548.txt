CD38 catalyzes the synthesis of two structurally distinct messengers for 
Ca²⁺-mobilization, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), from cytosolic substrates, NAD and NADP, 
respectively. CD38 is generally thought of as a type II membrane protein with 
its catalytic site facing outside. We recently showed that CD38 exists, instead, 
in two opposite membrane orientations. The determinant for the membrane topology 
is unknown. Here, specific antibodies against type III CD38 were designed and 
produced. We show that mutating the positively charged residues in the 
N-terminal tail of CD38 converted its orientation to type III, with the 
catalytic domain facing the cytosol and it was fully active in producing 
intracellular cADPR. Changing the serine residues to aspartate, which is 
functionally equivalent to phosphorylation, had a similar effect. The mutated 
CD38 was expressed intracellularly and was un-glycosylated. The membrane 
topology could also be modulated by changing the highly conserved di-cysteine. 
The results indicate that the net charge of the N-terminal segment is important 
in determining the membrane topology of CD38 and that the type III orientation 
can be a functional form of CD38 for Ca²⁺-signaling. This article is part of a 
Special Issue entitled: 13th European Symposium on Calcium.
