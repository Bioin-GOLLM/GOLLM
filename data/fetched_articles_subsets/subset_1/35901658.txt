BACKGROUND: As a rare subtype of lung adenocarcinoma, the diagnosis of pulmonary 
enteric adenocarcinoma (PEAC) remains challenging due to overlapping morphologic 
spectrum with lung metastatic colorectal cancer (lmCRC). However, the molecular 
features of PEAC as a separate lung cancer entity are poorly understood.
METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing and targeted bisulfite sequencing 
of 32 PEAC and 30 lmCRC to improve differential molecular characterization of 
the two diseases. We used machine learning methods to select key markers and 
developed a diagnostic classifier. In addition, we validated the classifier in 
the internal test cohort and an independently recruited external validation 
cohort with 17 PEAC and 7 lmCRC.
FINDINGS: Our results showed that EGFR was the key driver mutation in PEAC but 
at a lower prevalence compared to typical lung adenocarcinomas, whereas ERBB2 
and KRAS were more frequently observed in PEAC. By contrast, we observed 
significant enrichment of KRAS and APC mutations in lmCRC compared with PEAC. At 
the chromosome arm level, copy number variations in 13q, 14q, and 18p were the 
major chromosomal differences observed between PEAC and lmCRC. Furthermore, by 
comparing differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we established a neat DNA 
methylation-based classifier consisting of eight DMRs. This classifier correctly 
classified all samples in the training cohort and 95% of the samples in the 
internal test cohort. An external validation cohort of 24 cases recruited from 
multiple centers in China also reliably agreed with pathological diagnosis.
INTERPRETATION: These results provide solid evidence of PEAC-specific genomic 
characteristics and demonstrate the potential utility of DNA methylation markers 
for auxiliary diagnosis of PEAC and lmCRC.
