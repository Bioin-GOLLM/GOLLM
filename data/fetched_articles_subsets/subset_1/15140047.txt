Two novel human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles for DRB3 and DQB1 genes 
detected in Caucasoid Spanish individuals are described: DRB3*0218 and 
DQB1*030202. Both alleles have been found during routine high-resolution typing 
by sequencing. DRB3*0218 shows a novel DRB3 gene polymorphic position, located 
at amino acid residue 58, alanine to glutamic acid. This residue is shared by 
several DRB1 alleles, including all described DRB1*11 subtypes. DQB1*030202 
differs from DQB1*030201 by a point mutation at position 319 (T to C). This 
nucleotide change generates a new codon at amino acid position 75 that is not 
shared by any other DQB1 allele.
