Mitochondrial RNA polymerases (MtRNAPs) are members of the single-subunit RNAP 
family, the most well-characterized member being the RNAP from T7 bacteriophage. 
MtRNAPs are, however, functionally distinct in that they depend on one or more 
transcription factors to recognize and open the promoter and initiate 
transcription, while the phage RNAPs are capable of performing these tasks 
alone. Since the transcriptional mechanisms that are conserved in phage and 
mitochondrial RNAPs have been so effectively characterized in the phage enzymes, 
outstanding structure-mechanism questions concern those aspects that are 
distinct in the MtRNAPs, particularly the role of the mitochondrial 
transcription factor(s). To address these questions we have used both negative 
staining and cryo-EM to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of yeast 
MtRNAP initiation complexes with and without the mitochondrial transcription 
factor (MTF1), and of the elongation complex. Together with biochemical 
experiments, these data indicate that MTF1 uses multiple mechanisms to drive 
promoter opening, and that its interactions with the MtRNAP regulate the 
conformational changes undergone by the latter enzyme as it traverses the 
template strand.
