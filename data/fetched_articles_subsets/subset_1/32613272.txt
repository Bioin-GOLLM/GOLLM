PURPOSE: Surgical series of pineal region gliomas are rarely available. Whereas 
it is a general assumption that the extent of surgical resection correlates with 
survival outcomes of intracranial gliomas; the impact of the microsurgical 
resection on the long-term outcomes of pineal gliomas has been questioned. We 
present a surgical series of pineal region gliomas with focus on the survival 
outcome analysis.
METHODS: 17 histologically confirmed pineal region glioma patients classified as 
diffuse and non-diffuse gliomas were retrospectively analyzed. A detailed 
description of the series was followed by regression models to identify 
predictors of clinical outcomes. Uni- a multivariate survival analysis was 
performed to determine independent predictors of mortality.
RESULTS: Although the number of treated patients was small, only WHO grade 
histopathology remained significant (p = 0.02) after multivariate survival 
analysis with extent of resection, age, tumor volume, and preoperative 
functional status. The extent of the surgical resection did not correlate with 
the disease survival rates of non-diffuse (p = 1), diffuse (p = 0.2), nor all 
gliomas (p = 0.6). 15 of 17 patients underwent gross total (nine patients) or 
subtotal resection. The preoperative functional status of the patients showed 
overall improvement on the immediate (p < 0.001) and long-term (p = 0.03) 
follow-up after 106 (3 - 324) months.
CONCLUSION: The extent of the surgical resection does not seem to significantly 
impact on the survival outcomes of pineal region gliomas. Thus, genotype and 
molecular features may essentially affect the outcome. Further research on the 
field is required.
