Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is the most frequently encountered defect of 
the oxidative phosphorylation system. To identify the genetic cause of the 
complex I deficiency, we screened the gene encoding the NDUFS1 subunit. We 
report 3 patients with low residual complex I activity expressed in cultured 
fibroblasts, which displayed novel mutations in the NDUFS1 gene. One mutation 
introduces a premature stop codon, 3 mutations cause a substitution of amino 
acids and another mutation a deletion of one amino acid. The fibroblasts of the 
patients display a decreased amount and activity of complex I. In addition, a 
disturbed assembly pattern was observed. These results suggest that NDUFS1 is a 
prime candidate to screen for disease-causing mutations in patients with a very 
low residual complex I activity in cultured fibroblasts.
