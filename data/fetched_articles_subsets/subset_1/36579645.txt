BACKGROUND: When aortic cells are under stress, such as increased hemodynamic 
pressure, they adapt to the environment by modifying their functions, allowing 
the aorta to maintain its strength. To understand the regulation of this 
adaptive response, we examined transcriptomic and epigenomic programs in aortic 
smooth muscle cells (SMCs) during the adaptive response to AngII (angiotensin 
II) infusion and determined its importance in protecting against aortic aneurysm 
and dissection (AAD).
METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell sequencing 
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) analyses in a mouse 
model of sporadic AAD induced by AngII infusion. We also examined the direct 
effects of YAP (yes-associated protein) on the SMC adaptive response in vitro. 
The role of YAP in AAD development was further evaluated in AngII-infused mice 
with SMC-specific Yap deletion.
RESULTS: In wild-type mice, AngII infusion increased medial thickness in the 
thoracic aorta. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed an adaptive 
response in thoracic SMCs characterized by upregulated genes with roles in wound 
healing, elastin and collagen production, proliferation, migration, cytoskeleton 
organization, cell-matrix focal adhesion, and PI3K-PKB/Akt 
(phosphoinositide-3-kinase-protein kinase B/Akt) and TGF-Î² (transforming growth 
factor beta) signaling. ScATAC-seq analysis showed increased chromatin 
accessibility at regulatory regions of adaptive genes and revealed the 
mechanical sensor YAP/transcriptional enhanced associate domains as a top 
candidate transcription complex driving the expression of these genes (eg, Lox, 
Col5a2, Tgfb2). In cultured human aortic SMCs, cyclic stretch activated YAP, 
which directly bound to adaptive gene regulatory regions (eg, Lox) and increased 
their transcript abundance. SMC-specific Yap deletion in mice compromised this 
adaptive response in SMCs, leading to an increased AAD incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic stress triggers the systemic epigenetic induction of an 
adaptive response (eg, wound healing, proliferation, matrix organization) in 
thoracic aortic SMCs that depends on functional biomechanical signal 
transduction (eg, YAP signaling). Our study highlights the importance of the 
adaptive response in maintaining aortic homeostasis and preventing AAD in mice.
