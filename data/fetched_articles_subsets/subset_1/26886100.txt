Despite the large amount of variation found in the night (scotopic) vision 
capabilities of healthy volunteers, little effort has been made to characterize 
this variation and factors, genetic and non-genetic, that influence it. In the 
largest population of healthy observers measured for scotopic visual acuity (VA) 
and contrast sensitivity (CS) to date, we quantified the effect of a range of 
variables on visual performance. We found that young volunteers with excellent 
photopic vision exhibit great variation in their scotopic VA and CS, and this 
variation is reliable from one testing session to the next. We additionally 
identified that factors such as Circadian preference, iris color, astigmatism, 
depression, sex and education have no significant impact on scotopic visual 
function. We confirmed previous work showing that the amount of time spent on 
the vision test influences performance and that laser eye surgery results in 
worse scotopic vision. We also showed a significant effect of intelligence and 
photopic visual performance on scotopic VA and CS, but all of these variables 
collectively explain <30% of the variation in scotopic vision. The wide 
variation seen in young healthy volunteers with excellent photopic vision, the 
high test-retest agreement, and the vast majority of the variation in scotopic 
vision remaining unexplained by obvious non-genetic factors suggests a strong 
genetic component. Our preliminary genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 106 
participants ruled out any common genetic variants of very large effect and 
paves the way for future, larger genetic studies of scotopic vision.
