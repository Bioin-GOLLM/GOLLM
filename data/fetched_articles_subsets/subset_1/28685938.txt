Acquired Gitelman's syndrome (GS) associated with Sjögren syndrome (SS) is rare. 
A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our department because of nausea, acratia 
and sicca complex. Laboratory tests after admission showed renal failure, 
hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria, all of 
which met the diagnostic criteria for GS. Diagnostic evaluation identified 
primary SS as the cause of the acquired GS. Light microscopy of the renal tissue 
from the patient showed severe membranoproliferative glomerunephritis and 
tubulointerstitial nephritis. Immunohistochemical staining of the renal tissue 
showed the absence of sodium-chloride co-transporter (NCCT) in distal convoluted 
tubules. Genetic analysis of chromosomal DNA extracted from the patient's 
peripheral blood showed SLC12A3 gene heterozygous mutation. The reported case 
was comprehensively analyzed on the basis of the clinical features, and 
laboratory, pathological and genetic test findings. The patient has achieved a 
complete remission after meticulous care and appropriate treatment.
