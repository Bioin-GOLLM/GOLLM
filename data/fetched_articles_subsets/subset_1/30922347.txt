BACKGROUND: Heparanase (HPSE) is an endo-beta-glucuronidase that degrades 
heparan sulfate (HS) chains on proteoglycans. The oligosaccharides generated by 
HPSE promote angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. Heparanase-2 (HPSE2), a 
close homolog of HPSE, does not exhibit catalytic activity. Previous studies 
have demonstrated that serum or plasma from breast cancer patients showed 
increased expression of both heparanases in circulating lymphocytes. The aim of 
this study was to better understand the mechanisms involved in the upregulation 
of heparanases in circulating lymphocytes.
METHODS: Lymphocytes collected from healthy women were incubated in the presence 
of MCF-7 breast cancer cells (co-culture) to stimulate HPSE and HPSE2 
overexpression. The protein level of heparanases was evaluated by 
immunocytochemistry, while mRNA expression was determined by quantitative 
RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The medium obtained from co-culture of MCF-7 cells and circulating 
lymphocytes stimulated the expression of HPSE and HPSE2. Previous treatment of 
the co-culture medium with an anti-heparan sulfate proteoglycan antibody or 
heparitinase II inhibited the upregulation of heparanases in circulating 
lymphocytes. The addition of exogenous heparan sulfate (HS) enhanced the 
expression of both heparanases. Moreover, the co-cultured cells, as well as 
MCF-7 cells, secreted a higher number of exosomes expressing an increased level 
of HS compared to that of the exosomes secreted by circulating lymphocytes from 
women who were not affected by cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that HS is likely responsible for mediating 
the expression of heparanases in circulating lymphocytes. HS secreted by tumor 
cells might be carried by exosome particles, confirming the key role of tumor 
cells, as well as secreted HS, in upregulating the expression of heparanases, 
suggesting a possible mechanism of crosstalk between tumor cells and circulating 
lymphocytes.
