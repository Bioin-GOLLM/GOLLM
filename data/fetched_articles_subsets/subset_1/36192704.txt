BACKGROUND: The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has 
complicated the situation due to the decline in potency of second-line 
anti-tubercular drugs. This limits the treatment option for extensively 
drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). The aim of this study was to determine and 
compare the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by agar dilution and 
resazurin microtiter assay (REMA) along with the detection of mutations against 
linezolid and clofazimine in confirmed XDR-TB clinical isolates.
RESULTS: A total of 169 isolates were found positive for Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis complex (MTBC). The MIC was determined by agar dilution and REMA 
methods. The isolates which showed non-susceptibility were further subjected to 
mutation detection by targeting rplC gene (linezolid) and Rv0678 gene 
(clofazimine). The MIC for linezolid ranged from 0.125 µg/ml to > 2 µg/ml and 
for clofazimine from 0.25 µg/ml to > 4 µg/ml. The MIC50 and MIC90 for linezolid 
were 0.5 µg/ml and 1 µg/ml respectively while for clofazimine both were 1 µg/ml. 
The essential and categorical agreement for linezolid was 97.63% and 95.26% and 
for clofazimine, both were 100%. The sequencing result of the rplC gene revealed 
a point mutation at position 460 bp, where thymine (T) was substituted for 
cytosine (C) while seven mutations were noted between 46 to 220 bp in 
Rv0678 gene.
CONCLUSION: REMA method has been found to be more suitable in comparison to the 
agar dilution method due to lesser turnaround time. Mutations 
in rplC and Rv0678 genes were reasons for drug resistance against linezolid and 
clofazimine respectively.
