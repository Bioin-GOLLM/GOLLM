Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1) results from 
biallelic pathogenic variants in ATP8B1. This study sought second pathogenic 
variants in ATP8B1 by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in four unrelated low 
γ-glutamyl transpeptidase cholestasis patients in whom clinical suspicion of 
PFIC1 was high and gene-panel or Sanger sequencing had identified only one 
pathogenic variant in ATP8B1. Sanger sequencing confirmed WGS findings and 
determined the origin of each variant. Novel nonrecurrent structural variants in 
three patients (patient 1 to patient 3) were identified in trans: 
g.55396652_55403080del (6427-bp deletion), g.55335906_55346620dup (10,715-bp 
duplication), and g.55362063_55364293dup (2231-bp duplication). One synonymous 
variant in patient 4 was recognized in trans (c.1029G>A, p. Thr343Thr) and 
demonstrated as deleterious. In conclusion, WGS improves genetic diagnostic 
yield in PFIC1. These findings expand the gene-variant spectrum associated with 
familiar intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (FIC1) disease and for the first time report 
tandem duplication in ATP8B1 associated with cholestasis.
