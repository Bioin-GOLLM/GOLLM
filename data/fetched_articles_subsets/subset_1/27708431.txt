Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Critical components of the two AD 
pathological pathways, AÎ²-amyloidosis and Tauopathy, have been considered as 
therapeutic targets. Among them, much effort is focused on aberrant Tau 
phosphorylation and targeting Tau-phosphorylating kinases. Methylene blue (MB), 
a phenothiazine dye that crosses the blood-brain barrier, has been shown to hit 
multiple molecular targets involved in AD and have beneficial effects in 
clinical studies. Here we present evidence that microtubule affinity-regulating 
kinase (MARK4) is a novel target of MB. MB partially rescued the synaptic 
toxicity in Drosophila larva overexpressing PAR1 (MARK analog). In 293T culture, 
MB decreased MARK4-mediated Tau phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner. 
Further studies revealed a two-fold mechanism by MB including down-regulation of 
MARK4 protein level through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and inhibition of MARK4 
kinase activity in vitro. This study highlights the importance of MARK4 as a 
viable target for Tauopathy and provides fresh insight into the complex 
mechanism used by MB to treat AD.
