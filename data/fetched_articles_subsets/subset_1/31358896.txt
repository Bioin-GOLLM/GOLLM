The concentration of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in humans is 
partially determined by genetic factors; however, the role of these factors is 
incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and 
characteristics of CETP, LIPC, and SCARB1 variants in Korean individuals with 
extremely high HDL-C levels. We also analysed associations between these 
variants and cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
generation, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression. Of 13,545 
participants in the cardiovascular genome cohort, 42 subjects with HDL-C levels 
>100â€‰mg/dL were analysed. The three target genes were sequenced by targeted 
next-generation sequencing, the functional effects of detected variants were 
predicted, and CEC was assessed using a radioisotope and apolipoprotein 
B-depleted sera. We observed two rare variants of CETP in 13 individuals (rare 
variant c.A1196G [p.D399G] of CETP was discovered in 12 subjects) and one rare 
variant of SCARB1 in one individual. Furthermore, all subjects had at least one 
of four common variants (one CETP and three LIPC variants). Two additional novel 
CETP variants of unknown frequency were found in two subjects. However, the 
identified variants did not show significant associations with CEC, ROS 
generation, or VCAM-1 expression. Our study provides additional insights into 
the role of genetics in individuals with extremely high HDL-C.
