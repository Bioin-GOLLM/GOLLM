OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the expression of Sal-like 4 (SALL4) in breast 
cancer tissues and to explore the role of this gene in the carcinogenesis of 
breast cancer cells.
METHODS: A total of 62 paired breast cancer and noncancerous tissue samples were 
obtained from patients with breast cancer. SALL4 expression patterns and their 
association with clinicopathological characteristics were investigated by 
qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunochemistry in breast cancer tissues. After 
the knockdown of SALL4 by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), the proliferative, 
invasive, and apoptotic abilities of MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells (breast 
cancer cell lines) were measured by colony formation and CCK-8 assays, wound 
healing and transwell assays, and flow cytometry, respectively.
RESULTS: SALL4 expression was higher in breast cancer tissues than that in the 
paired noncancerous tissues, and increased SALL4 expression in tumor tissues was 
closely related to tumor size and lymphatic metastasis. Furthermore, functional 
experiments revealed that SALL4 knockdown inhibited the cell proliferation, 
induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1phase and apoptosis, and decreased the ability 
of migration and invasion in breast cancer cells. Additionally, our study first 
demonstrated that SALL4 played a critical role in modulating the tumorigenicity 
of breast cancer cells via the WNT/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the expression of SALL4 is upregulated in 
breast cancer, and this upregulation is involved in the regulation of cell 
growth, invasion, and apoptosis. Hence, SALL4 may be a promising target for 
diagnosis and therapy in patients with breast cancer.
