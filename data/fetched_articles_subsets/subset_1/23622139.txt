A combination of genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors contribute to the 
development and recurrence of acute and chronic pancreatitis; information on all 
of these is required to manage patients effectively. For example, variants that 
affect regulation of the protease, serine (PRSS)1-PRSS2, and claudin (CLDN)2 
loci, rather than their coding sequences, interact with other genetic and 
environmental factors to affect disease development. New strategies are needed 
to use these data and determine their contribution to pathogenesis, because 
these variants differ from previously studied, rare variants in exons (coding 
regions) of genes such as PRSS1, SPINK1, cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR), chymotrypsin (CTR)C, and calcium-sensing receptor 
(CASR). Learning how various genetic factors affect pancreatic cells and systems 
could lead to etiology-based therapies rather than treatment of symptoms.
