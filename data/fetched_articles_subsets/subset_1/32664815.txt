Ganglioside GM3 synthase (Î±-2,3-sialyltransferase, ST3GAL5, GM3S) is a key 
enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides. ST3GAL5 deficiency causes 
an absence of GM3 and all downstream biosynthetic derivatives. The affected 
individuals manifest deafness, severe irritability, intractable seizures, and 
profound intellectual disability. To investigate whether deficiency of GM3 is 
involved in seizure susceptibility, we induced seizures with different 
chemoconvulsants in ST3GAL5 knockout mice. We report here that ST3GAL5 knockout 
mice are hyperactive and more susceptible to seizures induced by 
chemoconvulsants, including kainate and pilocarpine, compared with normal 
controls. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, loss of GM3 aggravates 
seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis. These data indicate that GM3 and 
gangliosides derived from GM3 may serve as important regulators of epilepsy and 
may play an important role in aberrant neurogenesis associated with seizures.
