The important roles of mitochondrial function and dysfunction in the process of 
neurodegeneration are widely acknowledged. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) appear 
to be a highly vulnerable neuronal cell type in the central nervous system with 
respect to mitochondrial dysfunction but the actual reasons for this are still 
incompletely understood. These cells have a unique circumstance where 
unmyelinated axons must bend nearly 90Â° to exit the eye and then cross a 
translaminar pressure gradient before becoming myelinated in the optic nerve. 
This region, the optic nerve head, contains some of the highest density of 
mitochondria present in these cells. Glaucoma represents a perfect storm of 
events occurring at this location, with a combination of changes in the 
translaminar pressure gradient and reassignment of the metabolic support 
functions of supporting glia, which appears to apply increased metabolic stress 
to the RGC axons leading to a failure of axonal transport mechanisms. However, 
RGCs themselves are also extremely sensitive to genetic mutations, particularly 
in genes affecting mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial clearance. These 
mutations, which systemically affect the mitochondria in every cell, often lead 
to an optic neuropathy as the sole pathologic defect in affected patients. This 
review summarizes knowledge of mitochondrial structure and function, the known 
energy demands of neurons in general, and places these in the context of normal 
and pathological characteristics of mitochondria attributed to RGCs.
