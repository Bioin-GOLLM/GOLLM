PURPOSE: We evaluated clinical and genetic features enriched in patients with 
multiple Mendelian conditions to determine which patients are more likely to 
have multiple potentially relevant genetic findings (MPRF).
METHODS: Results of the first 7698 patients who underwent exome sequencing at 
Ambry Genetics were reviewed. Clinical and genetic features were examined and 
degree of phenotypic overlap between the genetic diagnoses was evaluated.
RESULTS: Among patients referred for exome sequencing, 2% had MPRF. MPRF were 
more common in patients from consanguineous families and patients with greater 
clinical complexity. The difference in average number of organ systems affected 
is small: 4.3 (multiple findings) vs. 3.9 (single finding) and may not be 
distinguished in clinic.
CONCLUSION: Patients with multiple genetic diagnoses had a slightly higher 
number of organ systems affected than patients with single genetic diagnoses, 
largely because the comorbid conditions affected overlapping organ systems. 
Exome testing may be beneficial for all cases with multiple organ systems 
affected. The identification of multiple relevant genetic findings in 2% of 
exome patients highlights the utility of a comprehensive molecular workup and 
updated interpretation of existing genomic data; a single definitive molecular 
diagnosis from analysis of a limited number of genes may not be the end of a 
diagnostic odyssey.
