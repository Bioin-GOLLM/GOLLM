Occupational and environmental exposure to pesticides may induce harmful effects 
on human health by promoting the development of a wide range of disorders. Some 
of the most recently hypothesized mechanisms are oxidative stress and epigenetic 
modifications, however biological effects seem to be modulated mainly by the 
occurrence of genetic polymorphisms. The susceptibility to exposure can be 
evaluated by studying the most common polymorphisms of genes involved in the 
metabolism of organophosphorus compounds (cytochrome P450, glutathione 
transferase, acetyltransferases or paraoxonase 1). The aim of this article is to 
review recent literature data concerning the influence of genetic polymorphisms 
on pesticides-induced oxidative damage.
