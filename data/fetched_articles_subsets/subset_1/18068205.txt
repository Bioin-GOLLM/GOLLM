We generated a lymphoid cell line (Sup-T1-Rev/Env) that stably expresses a 19-bp 
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting a conserved region of HIV-1 encoding for the 
Envelope and Rev proteins, which potently inhibited viral replication. However, 
continuous passage of HIV-1 in Sup-T1-Rev/Env generated virus mutants able to 
overcome the RNAi restriction. Sequence analysis of the emerging viruses showed 
that mutations were located at positions 5 and 17 of the target sequence. Both 
mutations are silent in the Env frame, but the mutation 5 generated an amino 
acid change (V47M) in the Rev reading frame. We have analyzed the impact of 
these two mutations on the RNAi mechanism, showing a more crucial role of the 
mutation 17 in the resistance to RNAi. We show that even targeting a conserved 
region of the HIV-1 genome involved in the biosynthesis of two essential genes, 
env and rev, the virus could evolve to escape by single point mutations in the 
target sequence, without a significant fitness cost.
