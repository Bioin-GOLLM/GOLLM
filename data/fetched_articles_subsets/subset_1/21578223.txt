The title compound, C(17)H(19)N(3)O(3)S, crystallizes with two closely similar 
independent mol-ecules related by a pseudotranslation of c/2. Each mol-ecule 
consists of three approximately planar moieties centred on the N(2)CS group and 
the two ring systems. The packing involves classical H bonds of the form 
N(amide)-H⋯S and N(hydrazine)-H⋯OC, together with various weak hydrogen bonds 
and N(hydrazine)-H⋯π inter-actions. The overall packing is three-dimensional, 
but layer substructures parallel to the xz plane can be readily identified. Each 
mol-ecule forms a topologically equivalent set of hydrogen-bond inter-actions.
