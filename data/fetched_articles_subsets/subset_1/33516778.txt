BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been associated with increased breast 
cancer risk, but commonly prescribed antidiabetic medications such as metformin 
may reduce risk. Few studies have investigated T2D and medications together in 
relation to breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data came from 44 541 Sister Study participants aged 35 to 
74 years at enrollment (2003-2009) who satisfied eligibility criteria, followed 
through 15 September 2017. Information on time-varying, self-reported, 
physician-diagnosed, prevalent and incident T2D, use of antidiabetic 
medications, and covariates was obtained from baseline and follow-up 
questionnaires. Incident breast cancers were confirmed with medical records. 
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated.
RESULTS: During follow-up (median, 8.6 years), 2678 breast cancers were 
diagnosed at least 1 year after enrollment. There were 3227 women (7.2%) with 
prevalent and 2389 (5.3%) with incident T2D, among whom 61% (n = 3386) were ever 
treated with metformin. There was no overall association between T2D and breast 
cancer risk (HR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87-1.13). However, T2D was associated with 
increased risk of triple-negative breast cancer (HR 1.40; 95% CI, 0.90-2.16). 
Compared with not having T2D, T2D with metformin use was not associated with 
overall breast cancer risk (HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83-1.15), but it was associated 
with decreased risk of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (HR 0.86; 
95% CI 0.70-1.05) and increased risk of ER-negative (HR 1.25; 95% CI, 0.84-1.88) 
and triple-negative breast cancer (HR 1.74; 95% CI, 1.06-2.83). The inverse 
association with ER-positive cancer was stronger for longer duration (≥10 year) 
metformin use (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38-1.01; P for trend = 0.09). Results were 
supported by sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that associations between T2D and breast cancer 
may differ by hormone receptor status and that associations between T2D and 
ER-positive breast cancer may be reduced by long-term metformin use.
