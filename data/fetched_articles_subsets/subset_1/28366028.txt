β-Thalassemia (β-thal) is a hemolytic anemia that is caused by point mutations 
in most cases. The Brazilian population is highly heterogeneous and knowledge of 
the mutations that make up the genotypic profile of individuals can contribute 
information about the formation of the population and clinical condition of 
patients. In this study, we evaluated the mutations present in homozygous β-thal 
patients from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We analyzed 24 samples of peripheral blood 
of patients with homozygous β-thal. To identify the mutations, we carried out 
allele-specific-polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) and DNA sequencing. We found 
11 different mutations on the β-globin gene. Among the most frequent mutations 
observed were HBB: c.92 + 6T>C, followed by HBB: c.93-21G>A, HBB: c.118C>T and 
HBB: c.92 + 1G>A. We also identified the rare mutation HBB: c.75T>A that was 
reported in an individual carrying Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T)/β-thal (HBB: c.75T>A) but 
not in Brazilian thalassemic patients, thus, this is the first report of this 
mutation in Brazilian β-thal patients. For its multiethnic character, Brazil has 
different mutations that cause β-thal and that are distributed with different 
frequencies according to the regions of the country. Our findings contribute to 
the description of the mutational profile of Brazilian thalassemic patients, 
showing wide heterogeneity and genetic variability.
