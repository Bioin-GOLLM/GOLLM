Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), that drain the large and small intestine, are 
critical sites for the induction of oral tolerance. Although depletion of CD4 T 
cells in the intestinal lamina propria is a hallmark of HIV infection, CD4 T 
cell dynamics in MLNs is less known due to the lack of accessibility to these 
LNs. We demonstrate the early loss of memory CD4 T cells, including T follicular 
helper cells (Tfh) and a remodeling of MLN architecture in SIV-infected rhesus 
macaques (RMs). Along with the loss of Tfh cells, we observe the loss of memory 
B cells and of germinal center B cells. Tfh cells display a Th1 profile with 
increased levels of the transcription factors that negatively impact on Tfh 
differentiation and of Stat5 phosphorylation. MLNs of SIV-infected RMs display 
lower mRNA transcripts encoding for IL-12, IL-23, and IL-35, whereas those 
coding for IL-27 are not impaired in MLNs. In vitro, IL-27 negatively impacts on 
Tfh cells and recapitulates the profile observed in SIV-infected RMs. Therefore, 
early defects of memory CD4 T cells, as well of Tfh cells in MLNs, which play a 
central role in regulating the mucosal immune response, may have major 
implications for Aids.
