PURPOSE: Genetic factor is an important predisposing element influencing the 
susceptibility to osteoporosis and related complications. The purpose of the 
present study is to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms of farnesyl 
diphosphate synthase (FDPS) or geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPS) genes 
were associated with the response to bisphosphonate therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 144 Korean women with osteoporosis 
were included. Among 13 genetic polymorphisms found within the FDPS and GGPS1 
gene, 4 genetic polymorphisms with frequencies > 5% were selected for further 
study. Bone mineral density (BMD) response after 1 year treatment of 
bisphosphonate therapy was analyzed according to the genotypes.
RESULTS: Women with 2 deletion allele of GGPS1 -8188A ins/del (rs3840452) had 
significantly higher femoral neck BMD at baseline compared with those with one 
or no deletion allele (0.768 +/- 0.127 vs. 0.695 +/- 0.090 respectively; p = 
0.041). The response rate of women with 2 deletion allele of GGPS1 -8188A 
ins/del (28.6%) was significantly lower than the rate of women with one (81.4%) 
or no deletion allele (75.0%) (p = 0.011). Women with 2 deletion allele of GGPS1 
-8188A ins/del had 7-fold higher risk of non-response to bisphosphonate therapy 
compared with women with other genotypes in GGPS1 -8188 after adjusting for 
baseline BMD (OR = 7.48; 95% CI = 1.32-42.30; p = 0.023). Other polymorphisms in 
FDPS or GGPS1 were not associated with lumbar spine BMD or femoral neck BMD.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that GGPS1 -8188A ins/del polymorphism may 
confer susceptibility to femoral neck BMD response to bisphosphonate therapy in 
Korean women. However, further study should be done to confirm the results in a 
larger population.
