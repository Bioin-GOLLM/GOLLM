Adoptive T-cell therapy is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer patients. 
The use of allogeneic T-cell grafts will improve its applicability and 
versatility provided that inherent allogeneic responses are controlled. T-cell 
activation is finely regulated by multiple signaling molecules that are 
transcriptionally controlled by epigenetic mechanisms. Here we report that 
inhibiting DOT1L, a histone H3-lysine 79 methyltransferase, alleviates 
allogeneic T-cell responses. DOT1L inhibition reduces miR-181a expression, which 
in turn increases the ERK phosphatase DUSP6 expression and selectively 
ameliorates low-avidity T-cell responses through globally suppressing T-cell 
activation-induced gene expression alterations. The inhibition of DOT1L or DUSP6 
overexpression in T cells attenuates the development of graft-versus-host 
disease, while retaining potent antitumor activity in xenogeneic and allogeneic 
adoptive immunotherapy models. These results suggest that DOT1L inhibition may 
enable the safe and effective use of allogeneic antitumor T cells by suppressing 
unwanted immunological reactions in adoptive immunotherapy.
