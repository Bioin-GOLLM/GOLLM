BACKGROUND: Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is rarely diagnosed in pregnant women, 
and only 7 cases have been reported to date. Thyroid dysfunction, especially 
hyperthyroidism, during pregnancy has been associated with both maternal and 
neonatal complications. Thus, the early diagnosis and treatment of SAT during 
pregnancy may be beneficial. We present a case report and literature review to 
complement the diagnostic evaluation and management of SAT during pregnancy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old woman presented in gestational week 17 of her 
first pregnancy and had a negative prior medical history. She presented to the 
Endocrinology Department complaining of neck pain for one month that had 
intensified in the last five days. Physical examination revealed a diffusely 
enlarged thyroid gland that was firm and tender on palpation. The patient also 
had an elevated temperature and heart rate. The increasing and long-lasting pain 
coupled with a decreased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone indicated 
hyperthyroidism. Ultrasound findings were indicative of SAT. Importantly, the 
pain was so severe that 10 mg of oral prednisone per day was administered in 
gestational week 18, which was increased to 15 mg/d after 10 days that was 
discontinued in week 28. Levothyroxine was started in gestational week 24 and 
administered throughout the pregnancy. The patient responded well to the 
treatments, and her neck pain disappeared in gestational week 21. She gave birth 
to a healthy male in gestational week 41.
CONCLUSION: SAT can be diagnosed and effectively managed during pregnancy, thus 
benefiting mothers and infants.
