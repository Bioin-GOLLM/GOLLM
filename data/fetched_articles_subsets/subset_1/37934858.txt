Metastases to the brain remain a significant problem in lung cancer, as 
treatment by most small-molecule targeted therapies is severely limited by 
efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we report the 
discovery of a selective, orally bioavailable, epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) inhibitor, 9, that exhibits high brain penetration and potent activity in 
osimertinib-resistant cell lines bearing L858R/C797S and exon19del/C797S EGFR 
resistance mutations. In vivo, 9 induced tumor regression in an intracranial 
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) murine model suggesting it as a potential lead 
for the treatment of localized and metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
driven by activating mutant bearing EGFR. Overall, we demonstrate that an 
underrepresented functional group in medicinal chemistry, the trisubstituted 
hydroxylamine moiety, can be incorporated into a drug scaffold without the 
toxicity commonly surmised to accompany these units, all while maintaining 
potent biological activity and without the molecular weight creep common to drug 
optimization campaigns.
