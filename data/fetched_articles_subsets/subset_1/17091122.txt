Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is characterised by intestinal obstruction resulting 
from an absence of ganglion cells in the intestinal tract. The mutations in the 
major gene, RET, associated with isolated HSCR, are dominant loss-of-function 
mutations with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. We have 
ascertained a large inbred Israeli-Arab family segregating HSCR. Sequencing of 
the RET gene showed a splicing mutation, IVS6+5G- >A, in the homozygous state in 
all the females with severe forms of HSCR and in the heterozygous state in the 
male patient with short-segment HSCR. The recently described hypomorphic-RET 
predisposing allele, rs2435357, was transmitted in the heterozygous state to the 
male patient, but was not transmitted to the three affected females. Although 
the heterozygous IVS6+5G- >A is of low-penetrance for short-segment HSCR 
disease, the homozygous state is fully penetrant for total aganglionosis or 
long-segment HSCR. As in other inbred populations segregating a weakly penetrant 
RET allele (Mennonite), our findings support the hypothesis that the penetrance 
of RET gene mutations for the HSCR phenotype depends on: (i) the nature of the 
mutation, (ii) the allele dosage and (iii) modifier-loci.
