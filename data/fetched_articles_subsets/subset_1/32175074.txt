Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell proliferation, autophagy, 
and apoptosis by participating in multiple signaling pathways in the body. 
Studies have shown that the mTOR signaling pathway is also associated with 
cancer, arthritis, insulin resistance, osteoporosis, and other diseases. The 
mTOR signaling pathway, which is often activated in tumors, not only regulates 
gene transcription and protein synthesis to regulate cell proliferation and 
immune cell differentiation but also plays an important role in tumor 
metabolism. Therefore, the mTOR signaling pathway is a hot target in anti-tumor 
therapy research. In recent years, a variety of newly discovered mTOR inhibitors 
have entered clinical studies, and a variety of drugs have been proven to have 
high activity in combination with mTOR inhibitors. The purpose of this review is 
to introduce the role of mTOR signaling pathway on apoptosis, autophagy, growth, 
and metabolism of tumor cells, and to introduce the research progress of mTOR 
inhibitors in the tumor field.
