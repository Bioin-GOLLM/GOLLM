A population of the criconematid species, identified as Criconema demani 
(Micoletzky, 1925), is reported from a natural habitat in northwestern Russia. 
Measurements and morpho-anatomy obtained with light microscopy and molecular 
characterization of this population are included in this paper. A population of
