Photosystem II (PS II) captures solar energy and directs charge separation (CS) 
across the thylakoid membrane during photosynthesis. The highly oxidizing, 
charge-separated state generated within its reaction center (RC) drives water 
oxidation. Spectroscopic studies on PS II RCs are difficult to interpret due to 
large spectral congestion, necessitating modeling to elucidate key spectral 
features. Herein, we present results from time-dependent density functional 
theory (TDDFT) calculations on the largest PS II RC model reported to date. This 
model explicitly includes six RC chromophores and both the chlorin phytol chains 
and the amino acid residues <6 Å from the pigments' porphyrin ring centers. 
Comparing our wild-type model results with calculations on mutant D1-His-198-Ala 
and D2-His-197-Ala RCs, our simulated absorption-difference spectra reproduce 
experimentally observed shifts in known chlorophyll absorption bands, 
demonstrating the predictive capabilities of this model. We find that inclusion 
of both nearby residues and phytol chains is necessary to reproduce this 
behavior. Our calculations provide a unique opportunity to observe the molecular 
orbitals that contribute to the excited states that are precursors to CS. 
Strikingly, we observe two high oscillator strength, low-lying states, in which 
molecular orbitals are delocalized over ChlD1 and PheD1 as well as one weaker 
oscillator strength state with molecular orbitals delocalized over the P 
chlorophylls. Both these configurations are a match for previously identified 
exciton-charge transfer states (ChlD1+PheD1-)* and (PD2+PD1-)*. Our results 
demonstrate the power of TDDFT as a tool, for studies of natural photosynthesis, 
or indeed future studies of artificial photosynthetic complexes.
