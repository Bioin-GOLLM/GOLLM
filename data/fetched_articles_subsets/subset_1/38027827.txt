BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis is becoming indispensable 
for the treatment of advanced lung cancer. NGS analysis requires a large number 
of cancer cell-containing tissues; however, it is often difficult for small 
biopsies to obtain the required quantities. In microdissection, only the tumour 
parts of a tissue specimen are obtained, which thereby increases the tumour 
content and tumour cell count of the tissue specimen. In this study, we 
investigated the extent to which the detection rate of genetic mutations changes 
by increasing the tumour content using microdissection.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study. In the genetic panel test 
using the Oncomine Dx Target Test (ODxTT), participants were divided into two 
groups: before (group A; April 2021-March 2022) and after (group B; April 
2022-December 2022) the introduction of microdissection. The submission criteria 
for ODxTT were tumour content and tumour cell count >30 % and >2000 in group A, 
and >40 % and >5000 in group B, respectively. We compared the rate of genetic 
mutations detected using ODxTT between the two groups.
RESULTS: This study included 214 consecutive ODxTT cases between April 2021 and 
December 2022. In group A (n = 112), 65 cases were adenocarcinoma, 84 involved 
lung tissue, and 64 underwent bronchoscopic sampling, whereas in group B 
(n = 102), 55 cases were adenocarcinoma, 91 cases involved lung tissue, and 79 
cases underwent bronchoscopic sampling. Furthermore, genetic mutations were 
detected in 39 of 112 cases (35 %) in group A and 59 of 102 cases (58 %) in 
group B, which was statistically higher in group B (P = 0.0006). Genetic 
mutations were detected in 45 of 55 adenocarcinoma cases in group B. The genetic 
mutations detected in epidermal growth factor rescepor (EGFR), Kirsten rat 
sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and mesenchymal epithelial transition 
(MET) were higher in group B.
CONCLUSION: Increasing the number of tumour cells and tumour content can enhance 
the detection rate of genetic mutations using ODxTT.
