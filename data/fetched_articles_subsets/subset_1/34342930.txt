Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive form of primary breast cancer 
characterized by rapid onset and high risk of metastasis and poor clinical 
outcomes. The biological basis for the aggressiveness of IBC is still not well 
understood and no IBC-specific targeted therapies exist. In this study, we 
report that lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a small secreted glycoprotein belonging to the 
lipocalin superfamily, is expressed at significantly higher levels in IBC vs 
non-IBC tumors, independently of molecular subtype. LCN2 levels were also 
significantly higher in IBC cell lines and in their culture media than in 
non-IBC cell lines. High expression was associated with poor-prognosis features 
and shorter overall survival in IBC patients. Depletion of LCN2 in IBC cell 
lines reduced colony formation, migration, and cancer stem cell populations 
in vitro and inhibited tumor growth, skin invasion, and brain metastasis in 
mouse models of IBC. Analysis of our proteomics data showed reduced expression 
of proteins involved in cell cycle and DNA repair in LCN2-silenced IBC cells. 
Our findings support that LCN2 promotes IBC tumor aggressiveness and offer a new 
potential therapeutic target for IBC.
