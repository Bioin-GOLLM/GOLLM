To assess the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) among persons with 
diabetes and prediabetes participating in the 2018 Population Health Survey in 
Greenland (B2018), a follow-up survey of three previous health surveys. 
Participants were invited to a diabetes complication screening. We assessed the 
prevalence of DR using Optos Daytona Ultra-wide field fundus camera and assessed 
differences in prevalence according to demographic and clinical characteristics 
using chi square test and a t-test and assessed DR based on ethnicity. The 
overall prevalence of DR was 2% (10/483). Among participants with HbA1c 
≥48 mmol/mol (6.5%) DR prevalence was 9% (9/91), compared with <1% (1/382) among 
participants with HbA1c <48 mmol/mol (6.5%). All participants with DR lived in 
towns. The mean Inuit genetic admixture was lower among participants with DR. 
The prevalence of DR is low in Greenland and almost non-existent among persons 
with HbA1c below the diabetes threshold.
