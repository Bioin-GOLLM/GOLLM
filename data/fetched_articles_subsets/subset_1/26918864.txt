OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of 
geographic atrophy (GA) among elderly Japanese with advanced age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD) in a clinic-based study.
METHODS: Two-hundred and ninety consecutive patients with advanced AMD were 
classified into typical neovascular AMD, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy 
(PCV), retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) or geographic atrophy (GA). 
Genetic variants of ARMS2 A69S (rs10490924) and CFH I62V (rs800292) were 
genotyped using TaqMan Genotyping Assays. The clinical and genetic 
characteristics were compared between patients with and without GA.
RESULTS: The number of patients diagnosed as having typical neovascular AMD, 
PCV, RAP and GA were 98 (33.8%), 151 (52.1%), 22 (7.5%) and 19 (6.6%), 
respectively. Of 19 patients with GA, 13 patients (68.4%) had unilateral GA with 
exudative AMD in the contralateral eye. Patients with GA were significantly 
older, with a higher prevalence of reticular pseudodrusen, bilateral involvement 
of advanced AMD and T-allele frequency of ARMS2 A69S compared with those with 
typical AMD and PCV; although there were no differences in the genetic and 
clinical characteristics among patients with GA and RAP.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of GA was 6.6% among elderly Japanese with AMD. 
Patients with GA and RAP exhibited genetic and clinical similarities.
