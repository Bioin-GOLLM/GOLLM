OBJECTIVE: To identify the mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in 
Yunnan so as to enhance the gene diagnosis of classical phenylketonuria (PKU) in 
that south-western province of China.
METHODS: Exons 4,5,6,7,10,11 and 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase(PAH) were 
analyzed in 13/14 children affected with classical PKU from Yunnan by using 
PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP),PCR-ASO dot blot 
hybridization,allele specific polymerase chain reaction(ASPCR) and PCR-direct 
sequencing.
RESULTS: Five missense mutations, i.e. R243Q. (5/26), Y204C(3/28), 
G247V(1/26),R413P(2/28) and T418P(1/28);three nonsense mutations,i.e. 
Y166X(C-->G)(2/26),W326X(1/28) and Y356X(2/26);and one silent 
mutation(V399V)(2/26) were identified. The nonsense mutation Y166X(C-->G) should 
be a novel mutation as compared with the PAH Mutation Database.
CONCLUSION: Five kinds of popular PAH gene mutation (R243Q,Y204C,V399V,Y356X and 
R413P) identified in the people of Yunnan are similar to those in the northern 
people, but such characteristic is different from that in the southern people. 
This finding will enhance the efficacy in gene diagnosis of PKU and will be of 
reference value for studies of population and regional difference in the pattern 
of PAH mutation distribution.
