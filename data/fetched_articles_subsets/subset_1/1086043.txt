Vasopressin and its analogs are used inthe treatment of bleeding esophageal 
varices. Since gastrointestinal reflux may have a deleterious effect on variceal 
hemorrhage, the effect of 2,3-phenylalanine-8-lysine-vasopressin upon the lower 
esophageal sphincter (LES) was studies by rapid pull-through manometry in 24 
persons. PLV infusion up to a dosis of 2.7 mU/kg/h raised LES pressure from 15.1 
+/- 1.3 (SEM) to 17.9 +/- 2.0 mm Hg. Higher doses lowered LES pressure 
progressively to 12.1 +/- 0.7 mmHg at 54 mU/kg/h. The serum gastrin level did 
neither correlate with basal LES pressure not with LES pressure changes during 
PLV infusion. Therefore, PLV does not appear to act indirectly through serum 
gastrin. Because of the danger of systemic side effects and of the undesirable 
in LES pressure with the usual high doses of vasoactive substances, a continuous 
infusion of lower doses of vasopressin analogs appears to be advantageous.
