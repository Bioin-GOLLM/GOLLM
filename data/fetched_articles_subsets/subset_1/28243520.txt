Intravital imaging by multiphoton microscopy is a powerful tool to gain 
invaluable insight into tissue biology and function. Here, we provide a 
step-by-step tissue preparation protocol for imaging the mouse tibialis anterior 
skeletal muscle. Additionally, we include steps for jugular vein catheterization 
that allow for well-controlled intravenous reagent delivery. Preparation of the 
tibialis anterior muscle is minimally invasive, reducing the chances of inducing 
damage and inflammation prior to imaging. The tibialis anterior muscle is useful 
for imaging leukocyte interaction with vascular endothelium, and to understand 
muscle contraction biology. Importantly, this model can be easily adapted to 
study neuromuscular diseases and myopathies.
