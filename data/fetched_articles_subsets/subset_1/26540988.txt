[DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS OF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS SENESCENCE].

[Article in Chinese]

Zhu H, Wang F, Wang Y.

OBJECTIVE: TO summarize the researcn situation or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 
senescence, including the characteristics and mechanisms of senescence.
METHODS: The original articles in recent years about MSCs senescence were 
extensively reviewed, and comprehensively analyzed.
RESULTS: The senescence of MSCs which manifests as morphological senescence, 
reduced proliferation and differentiation potential, altered immunoregulation 
are found during the cultivation in experiment, which profoundly affects 
clinical application of MSCs. The research about the mechanisms of MSCs 
senescence includes telomere and telomerase, and stress-mediated injury etc, 
involving regulation of telomerase, and regulation of signal pathways of 
p53/p21, P13K/Akt, and Wnt/Î²-catenin etc.
CONCLUSION: The further study of senescence mechanisms will help to accelerate 
the clinical application of MSCs in the future.
