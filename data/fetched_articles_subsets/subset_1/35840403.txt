Milk is a primary protein source that has always played a role in mammalian 
health. Despite the intensification of research projects on dromedary and the 
knowledge of the genetic diversity at the casein loci, the genetic structure of 
the Tunisian camel population still needs exploration. This study sought to 
determine the genetic diversity of 3 casein gene variants in 5 Tunisian camel 
ecotypes: c.150G>T at CSN1S1 (αS1-casein), g.2126A>G at CSN2 (β-casein), and 
g.1029T>C at CSN3 (κ-casein). The obtained results were compared with data 
published on Sudanese and Nigerian camels to establish the level of 
differentiation within and between populations. A total of 159 blood samples 
were collected from 5 Tunisian camel ecotypes and the extracted DNA was 
genotyped by PCR-RFLP. A streamlined genotyping protocol was also developed for 
CSN3. Results indicated that allele T was quite rare (0.06) at CSN1S1 for all 
ecotypes. Minor allele frequency was found for G (0.462) in CSN2 except for 
Ardhaoui Medenine ecotype who deviated from the average CSN2 allele frequency of 
the total population. Allele C showed minor allele frequency of 0.384 in CSN3. 
Among the Tunisian population, GAT (0.343) was the most represented haplotype in 
all ecotypes except for Ardhaoui Medenine, where GGC (0.322) was the most 
frequent one. Significant differences in heterozygosity and local inbreeding 
were observed across the Tunisian, Sudanese, and Nigerian populations, although 
the global fixation index indicated that only 2.2% of the genetic variance is 
related to ecotype differences. Instead, phylogenetic analysis revealed a closer 
link between the Tunisian and Sudanese populations through a clade subdivision 
with 3 main branches among the ecotypes. This study represents the first attempt 
to understand casein gene variability in Tunisian camels; with further study, 
milk traits and genetic differentiation among populations can be associated with 
the history of camel domestication.
