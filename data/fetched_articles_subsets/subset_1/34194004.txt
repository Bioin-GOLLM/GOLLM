PURPOSE: Recessive cytosolic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) deficiencies are 
severe multiorgan diseases, with limited treatment options. By loading transfer 
RNAs (tRNAs) with their cognate amino acids, ARS are essential for protein 
translation. However, it remains unknown why ARS deficiencies lead to specific 
symptoms, especially early life and during infections. We set out to increase 
pathophysiological insight and improve therapeutic possibilities.
METHODS: In fibroblasts from patients with isoleucyl-RS (IARS), leucyl-RS 
(LARS), phenylalanyl-RS-beta-subunit (FARSB), and seryl-RS (SARS) deficiencies, 
we investigated aminoacylation activity, thermostability, and sensitivity to 
ARS-specific amino acid concentrations, and developed personalized treatments.
RESULTS: Aminoacylation activity was reduced in all patients, and further 
diminished at 38.5/40 °C (PLARS and PFARSB), consistent with infectious 
deteriorations. With lower cognate amino acid concentrations, patient fibroblast 
growth was severely affected. To prevent local and/or temporal deficiencies, we 
treated patients with corresponding amino acids (follow-up: 1/2-2 2/3rd years), 
and intensified treatment during infections. All patients showed beneficial 
treatment effects, most strikingly in growth (without tube feeding), head 
circumference, development, coping with infections, and oxygen dependency.
CONCLUSION: For these four ARS deficiencies, we observed a common disease 
mechanism of episodic insufficient aminoacylation to meet translational demands 
and illustrate the power of amino acid supplementation for the expanding ARS 
patient group. Moreover, we provide a strategy for personalized preclinical 
functional evaluation.
