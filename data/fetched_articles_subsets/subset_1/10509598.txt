OBJECTIVE: The association of resting and exercise blood pressure (BP) and fat 
mass with the angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T polymorphism was investigated in 522 
sedentary Caucasian subjects from 99 families.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Resting BP was measured on two separate days, 
three times each day, and the mean of six valid measurements was used. Exercise 
BP was measured during a cycle ergometer test at a constant power output (50 W). 
Body composition was derived from under-water weighing and the AGT M235T 
polymorphism was typed with a polymerase chain reaction-based method.
RESULTS: Neither resting nor exercise BP was associated with the AGT genotypes. 
In mothers, the homozygotes for the T allele showed 8.8 kg and 7.1 kg greater 
(p=0.017) age-adjusted body fat mass (FM) than the MM homozygotes and 
heterozygotes, respectively. Sixty-nine percent of all TT homozygotes were found 
in the highest FM tertile, whereas only 16% of the MM homozygotes fell in the 
same tertile (p = 0.008). Moreover, a significant interaction was seen between 
FM and T-allele carrier status in women with regard to resting diastolic BP (p = 
0.002). Among women with a FM> or =24 kg, carriers of the T allele showed a 6.3 
mmHg higher diastolic blood pressure (DBP) than non-carriers whereas no 
difference was found in women with a FM less than 24 kg. A similar trend toward 
an interaction term was evident with resting systolic blood pressure (p = 0.011) 
and exercise DBP (p = 0.012). Body fat was not associated with the AGT 
polymorphism in fathers or in offspring.
DISCUSSION: These data suggest that the AGT M235T polymorphism is associated 
with body fatness in women, and that the relationship between DBP and AGT M235T 
polymorphism is dependent on FM in middle-aged sedentary normotensive women.
