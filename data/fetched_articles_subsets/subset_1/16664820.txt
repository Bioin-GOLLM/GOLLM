Succulent stems of Cissus quadrangularis L. (Vitaceae) contain glutamine 
synthetase, glutamate synthase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. The CO(2) and water 
gas exchanges of detached internodes were typical for Crassulacean acid 
metabolism plants. During three physiological phases, e.g. in the dark, in the 
early illumination period after stomata closure, and during the late light phase 
with the stomata wide open, (15)NH(4)Cl was injected into the central pith of 
stem sections. The kinetics of (15)N labeling in glutamate and glutamine 
suggested that glutamine synthetase was involved in the initial ammonia 
fixation. In the presence of methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutamine 
synthetase, the incorporation of (15)N derived from (15)NH(4)Cl was almost 
completely inhibited. Injections of amido-(15)N glutamine demonstrated a 
potential for (15)N transfer from the amido group of glutamine into glutamate 
which was suppressed by the glutamate synthase inhibitor, azaserine. The 
evidence indicates that glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase could 
assimilate ammonia and cycle nitrogen during all phases of Crassulacean acid 
metabolism.
