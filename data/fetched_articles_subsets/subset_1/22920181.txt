Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting one in eight 
children in the USA and worldwide. It is a complex disease, influenced by both 
environmental exposures and genetic factors. Although epigenetic modifications 
(DNA methylation, histone modification and miRNA) can affect transcriptional 
activity in multiple genetic pathways relevant for asthma development, very 
limited work has been carried out so far to examine the role of epigenetic 
variations on asthma development and management. This review provides a brief 
overview of epigenetic modifications, summarizes recent findings, and discusses 
some of the major methodological concerns that are relevant for asthma 
epigenetics.
