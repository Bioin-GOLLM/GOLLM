Viral tracers that enable efficient retrograde labeling of projection neurons 
are powerful vehicles for structural and functional dissections of the neural 
circuit and for the treatment of brain diseases. Currently, some recombinant 
adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) based on capsid engineering are widely used for 
retrograde tracing, but display undesirable brain area selectivity due to 
inefficient retrograde transduction in certain neural connections. Here we 
developed an easily editable toolkit to produce high titer AAV11 and 
demonstrated that it exhibits potent and stringent retrograde labeling of 
projection neurons in adult male wild-type or Cre transgenic mice. AAV11 can 
function as a powerful retrograde viral tracer complementary to AAV2-retro in 
multiple neural connections. In combination with fiber photometry, AAV11 can be 
used to monitor neuronal activities in the functional network by retrograde 
delivering calcium-sensitive indicator under the control of a neuron-specific 
promoter or the Cre-lox system. Furthermore, we showed that GfaABC1D promoter 
embedding AAV11 is superior to AAV8 and AAV5 in astrocytic tropism in vivo, 
combined with bidirectional multi-vector axoastrocytic labeling, AAV11 can be 
used to study neuron-astrocyte connection. Finally, we showed that AAV11 allows 
for analyzing circuit connectivity difference in the brains of the Alzheimer's 
disease and control mice. These properties make AAV11 a promising tool for 
mapping and manipulating neural circuits and for gene therapy of some 
neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.
