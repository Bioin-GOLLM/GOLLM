By site-directed mutagenesis on human cytidine deaminase (CDA), five mutant 
proteins were obtained: C65A, C99A, C102A, E67D and E67Q. The three cysteine 
mutants were completely inactive, whereas E67D and E67Q showed a specific 
activity about 200- and 200000-fold lower, respectively, than the wild-type CDA. 
Zinc analysis revealed that only E67D, E67Q and C65A contained 1 mol Zn2+/mol 
subunit as in the wild-type CDA. Kinetic measurements with the specific 
carboxylic group reagent N-ethoxy-carbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline 
performed on wild-type CDA suggest that Glu67 is essential for the catalytic 
process. Furthermore, when both native and denatured CDA was titrated with 
5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) six sulfhydryl groups were detected, whereas 
in the denatured and reduced enzyme nine such groups were found, according to 
the sequence data. When p-hydroxymercuriphenyl sulfonate was used, nine 
sulfhydryl groups were detectable and the release of 1 mol of zinc per mole of 
CDA subunit was revealed by the metal indicator dye 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol. 
It seems plausible that the limiting step for the maintenance of zinc in the 
active site is the formation of coordination between Cys99 and Cys102, whereas 
Cys65 could lead the zinc to the correct position and orientation within the 
active site.
