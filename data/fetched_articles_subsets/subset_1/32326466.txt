Inflammation is a body's protective mechanism to eliminate invading pathogens 
and cellular damaging signals. The inflammatory response consists of two main 
consecutive steps-a priming step preparing the inflammatory responses and a 
triggering step boosting the inflammatory responses. The main feature of the 
triggering step is the activation of the inflammasome, an intracellular 
multiprotein complex facilitating the inflammatory responses. The regulatory 
roles of 'canonical' inflammasomes in the inflammatory responses and diseases 
have been largely investigated, so far. New types of inflammasomes have been 
recently discovered and named as 'non-canonical' inflammasomes since their roles 
to induce inflammatory responses are similar to those of canonical 
inflammasomes, however, the stimulating ligands and the underlying mechanisms 
are different. Therefore, a growing number of studies have actively investigated 
the novel roles of non-canonical inflammasomes in inflammatory responses and 
diseases. This review summarizes and discusses the recent studies exploring the 
regulatory roles of caspase-11 non-canonical inflammasome during the 
inflammatory responses and provides insight into the development of novel 
therapeutics for infectious and inflammatory diseases by targeting caspase-11 
non-canonical inflammasome.
