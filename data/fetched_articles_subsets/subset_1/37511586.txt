Glycosylation is a widespread glycosyl modification that regulates gene 
expression and metabolite bioactivity in all life processes of plants. 
Phosphoribosylation is a special glycosyl modification catalyzed by 
phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase), which functions as a key step in the 
biosynthesis pathway of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, histidine, 
tryptophan, and coenzyme NAD(P)+ to control the production of these essential 
metabolites. Studies in the past decades have reported that PRTases are 
indispensable for plant survival and thriving, whereas the complicated 
physiological role of PRTases in plant life and their crosstalk is not well 
understood. Here, we comprehensively overview and critically discuss the recent 
findings on PRTases, including their classification, as well as the function and 
crosstalk in regulating plant development, abiotic stress response, and the 
balance of growth and stress responses. This review aims to increase the 
understanding of the role of plant PRTase and also contribute to future research 
on the trade-off between plant growth and stress response.
