According to the "amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease," beta-amyloid is 
the primary driving force in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Despite the 
development of many transgenic mouse lines developing abundant 
beta-amyloid-containing plaques in the brain, the actual link between amyloid 
plaques and neuron loss has not been clearly established, as reports on neuron 
loss in these models have remained controversial. We investigated transgenic 
mice expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein APP751 (KM670/671NL and 
V717I) and human mutant presenilin-1 (PS-1 M146L). Stereologic and image 
analyses revealed substantial age-related neuron loss in the hippocampal 
pyramidal cell layer of APP/PS-1 double-transgenic mice. The loss of neurons was 
observed at sites of Abeta aggregation and surrounding astrocytes but, most 
importantly, was also clearly observed in areas of the parenchyma distant from 
plaques. These findings point to the potential involvement of more than one 
mechanism in hippocampal neuron loss in this APP/PS-1 double-transgenic mouse 
model of Alzheimer's disease.
