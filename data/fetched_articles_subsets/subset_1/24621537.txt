BACKGROUND: Caveolin-1 (CAV-1), a structural protein of the cell membrane, is 
involved in tissue homeostasis, inflammation, oxidative stress, microbial 
clearance, and fibrosis.
METHODS: We investigated a genetic predisposition of the CAV-1 gene on survival, 
acute and chronic rejection, lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB), and respiratory 
infection after lung transplantation (LTx).
RESULTS: In 503 of 568 patients, the CAV-1 (rs3807989) polymorphism was 
successfully determined; 92 had the AA, 234 the AG, and 177 the GG genotype. 
Patients with the GG genotype had a decreased mortality with a adjusted hazard 
ratio of 0.72 (CI=0.53-0.98; P=0.034), but no association was found with chronic 
rejection, LB, acute rejection, or respiratory infections, although 
significantly less patients with the GG genotype died of infections (P=0.029). 
Airway neutrophilia (P=0.047) and systemic C-reactive protein (CRP, P=0.034) 
were decreased over time in the GG carriers compared to carriers of the A 
allele.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the GG genotype of CAV-1 is protective, associated 
with a decreased overall mortality but not with acute or chronic rejection, LB, 
and respiratory infections after LTx. The decreased mortality was linked with 
less infections of any kind and also lower systemic CRP, and airway neutrophils 
were observed, suggesting an overall decreased susceptibility for infectious 
complications in carriers of the GG genotype.
