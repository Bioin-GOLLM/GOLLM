A second-born breastfed infant presented with zinc deficiency. His mother had a 
novel heterozygous mutation in SLC30A2. A previous baby did not have zinc 
deficiency but the mother had taken a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) during the 
second pregnancy. Antenatal PPI exposure may plausibly contribute to transient 
infantile zinc deficiency.
