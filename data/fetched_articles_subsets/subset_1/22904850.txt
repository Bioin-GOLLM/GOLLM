In the title compound, C(33)H(32)N(2)O(2), the tetra-hydro-pyridine ring adopts 
a boat conformation with the carbonyl group in an s-cis conformation with 
respect to the C=C bond of the six-membered tetra-hydro-pyridine ring. The 
mol-ecular conformation is stabilized by intra-molecular N-H⋯O, C-H⋯O and C-H⋯π 
inter-actions. Formation of centrosymmetric head-to-head dimers is observed 
through pairwise inter-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. Additional weak C-H⋯O and 
C-H⋯π inter-actions stabilize the three-dimensional mol-ecular assembly.
