SIGNIFICANCE: Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are a valuable tool 
for studying neural circuits in vivo, but the relative merits and limitations of 
one-photon (1P) vs. two-photon (2P) voltage imaging are not well characterized.
AIM: We consider the optical and biophysical constraints particular to 1P and 2P 
voltage imaging and compare the imaging properties of commonly used GEVIs under 
1P and 2P excitation.
APPROACH: We measure brightness and voltage sensitivity of voltage indicators 
from commonly used classes under 1P and 2P illumination. We also measure the 
decrease in fluorescence as a function of depth in mouse brain. We develop a 
simple model of the number of measurable cells as a function of reporter 
properties, imaging parameters, and desired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We then 
discuss how the performance of voltage imaging would be affected by sensor 
improvements and by recently introduced advanced imaging modalities.
RESULTS: Compared to 1P excitation, 2P excitation requires ~104-fold more 
illumination power per cell to produce similar photon count rates. For voltage 
imaging with JEDI-2P in mouse cortex with a target SNR of 10 (spike 
height:baseline shot noise), a measurement bandwidth of 1 kHz, a thermally 
limited laser power of 200 mW, and an imaging depth of > 300 μm, 2P voltage 
imaging using an 80 MHz source can record from no more 12 cells simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the stringent photon-count requirements of voltage imaging 
and the modest voltage sensitivity of existing reporters, 2P voltage imaging in 
vivo faces a stringent tradeoff between shot noise and tissue photodamage. 2P 
imaging of hundreds of neurons with high SNR at depth > 300 μm will require 
either major improvements in 2P GEVIs or qualitatively new approaches to 
imaging.
