In the title mol-ecular salt, C5H12N(+)·C6H4NO3 (-), the piperidine ring adopts 
a chair conformation and the cation is protonated at the N atom. In the anion, 
the nitro group is twisted at an angle of 10.30 (11)° with respect to the 
attached benzene ring. In the crystal, N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds link adjacent anions 
and cations into infinite chains propagating along [100]. The chains are linked 
by C-H⋯π inter-actions, forming sheets lying parallel to (001).
