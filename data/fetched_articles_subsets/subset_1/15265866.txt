Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) from the bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus catalyzes 
the hydroxylation of xanthine to uric acid with NAD+ as the electron acceptor. 
R. capsulatus XDH forms an (alphabeta)2 heterotetramer and is highly homologous 
to homodimeric eukaryotic xanthine oxidoreductases. Here we first describe 
reductive titration and steady state kinetics on recombinant wild-type R. 
capsulatus XDH purified from Escherichia coli, and we then proceed to evaluate 
the catalytic importance of the active site residues Glu-232 and Glu-730. The 
steady state and rapid reaction kinetics of an E232A variant exhibited a 
significant decrease in both kcat and kred as well as increased Km and Kd values 
as compared with the wild-type protein. No activity was determined for the 
E730A, E730Q, E730R, and E730D variants in either the steady state or rapid 
reaction experiments, indicating at least a 10(7) decrease in catalytic 
effectiveness for this variant. This result is fully consistent with the 
proposed role of this residue as an active site base that initiates catalysis.
