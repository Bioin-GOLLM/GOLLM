The Mre11-Rad50 complex is a DNA double-strand break sensor that cleaves blocked 
DNA ends and hairpins by an ATP-dependent endo/exonuclease activity for 
subsequent repair. For that, Mre11-Rad50 complexes, including the Escherichia 
coli homolog SbcCD, can endonucleolytically cleave one or both strands near a 
protein block and process free DNA ends via a 3'-5' exonuclease, but a unified 
basis for these distinct activities is lacking. Here we analyzed DNA binding, 
ATPase and nuclease reactions on different DNA substrates. SbcCD clips terminal 
bases of both strands of the DNA end in the presence of ATPγS. It introduces a 
DNA double-strand break around 20-25 bp from a blocked end after multiple rounds 
of ATP hydrolysis in a reaction that correlates with local DNA meltability. 
Interestingly, we find that nuclease reactions on opposing strands are 
chemically distinct, leaving a 5' phosphate on one strand, but a 3' phosphate on 
the other strand. Collectively, our results identify an unexpected chemical 
variability of the nuclease, indicating that the complex is oriented at a free 
DNA end and facing a block with opposite polarity. This suggests a unified model 
for ATP-dependent endo- and exonuclease reactions at internal DNA near a block 
and at free DNA ends.
