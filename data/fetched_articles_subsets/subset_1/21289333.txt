BACKGROUND: Oncogenic activation of EGF-signalling pathway is central to the 
progression of colorectal cancer. The use of mutations of the KRAS codons 12 and 
13 as a selection biomarker for anti-endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
monoclonal antibody treatment is at present the first major step towards 
individualised treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The 
impact of BRAF V600E mutation is not well documented.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 803 metastatic cancer samples from colorectal 
cancer patients were explored for KRAS exon 2 and BRAF exon 15 mutations. BRAF 
mutated samples were characterized for mismatch repair function.
RESULTS: Overall, 344 tumours were mutated, with 34 of them involving BRAF 
mutations (8 of microsatellite instability type). No specificity was found 
according to gender, age at diagnosis and tumour localisation.
CONCLUSION: A complete analysis of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA status may identify 
approximately 10-15% additional patients who are unlikely to respond an 
EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody and who may benefit from prospective and 
specific new biomarker-driven studies.
