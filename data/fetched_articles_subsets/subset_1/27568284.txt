The mechanisms underlying Zika virus (ZIKV)-related microcephaly and other 
neurodevelopment defects remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the 
derivation and characterization, including single-cell RNA-seq, of neocortical 
and spinal cord neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells to model early human 
neurodevelopment and ZIKV-related neuropathogenesis. By analyzing human NES 
cells, organotypic fetal brain slices, and a ZIKV-infected micrencephalic brain, 
we show that ZIKV infects both neocortical and spinal NES cells as well as their 
fetal homolog, radial glial cells (RGCs), causing disrupted mitoses, 
supernumerary centrosomes, structural disorganization, and cell death. ZIKV 
infection of NES cells and RGCs causes centrosomal depletion and mitochondrial 
sequestration of phospho-TBK1 during mitosis. We also found that nucleoside 
analogs inhibit ZIKV replication in NES cells, protecting them from ZIKV-induced 
pTBK1 relocalization and cell death. We established a model system of human 
neural stem cells to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying 
neurodevelopmental defects associated with ZIKV infection and its potential 
treatment.
