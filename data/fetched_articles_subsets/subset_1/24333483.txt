Fusion of the viral and host cell membranes is a necessary first step for 
infection by enveloped viruses and is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein. The 
transmembrane subunits from the structurally defined "class I" glycoproteins 
adopt an α-helical "trimer-of-hairpins" conformation during the fusion pathway. 
Here, we present our studies on the envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit, 
GP2, of the CAS virus (CASV). CASV was recently identified from annulated tree 
boas (Corallus annulatus) with inclusion body disease and is implicated in the 
disease etiology. We have generated and characterized two protein constructs 
consisting of the predicted CASV GP2 core domain. The crystal structure of the 
CASV GP2 post-fusion conformation indicates a trimeric α-helical bundle that is 
highly similar to those of Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP2 despite CASV genome 
homology to arenaviruses. Denaturation studies demonstrate that the stability of 
CASV GP2 is pH dependent with higher stability at lower pH; we propose that this 
behavior is due to a network of interactions among acidic residues that would 
destabilize the α-helical bundle under conditions where the side chains are 
deprotonated. The pH-dependent stability of the post-fusion structure has been 
observed in Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP2, as well as other viruses that 
enter via the endosome. Infection experiments with CASV and the related Golden 
Gate virus support a mechanism of entry that requires endosomal acidification. 
Our results suggest that, despite being primarily arenavirus like, the 
transmembrane subunit of CASV is extremely similar to the filoviruses.
