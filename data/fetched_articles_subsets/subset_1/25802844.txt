Twin and family studies indicate that smoking addiction is highly influenced by 
genetic factors. Variants in the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 
(CRHR1) gene have been associated with alcoholism and depression. In this study, 
we tested five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CRHR1 for their 
association with ND, which was assessed by smoking quantity (SQ), the Heaviness 
of Smoking Index (HSI), and the Fagerstr√∂m test for ND (FTND) in 2,037 subjects 
from 602 families of either European American (EA) or African American (AA) 
ancestry. Association analysis of the five SNPs revealed a significant 
association of rs171440 with SQ in the AA sample and with SQ and FTND in the 
pooled AA and EA samples. Haplotype-based association analysis indicated 
significant association of haplotypes C-C (56.9%) and T-C (38.9%), formed by 
SNPs rs171440 and rs1396862, with SQ in the AA sample, C-C-G (47.6%) with SQ, 
and T-C-G (42.3%), formed by SNPs rs171440, rs1396862, and rs878886, with SQ and 
FTND in the pooled AA and EA samples. However, none of these associations 
remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Together, our 
results provide suggestive evidence for the involvement of CRHR1 in ND, which 
warrants further investigation using larger independent samples.
