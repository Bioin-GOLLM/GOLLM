Crop yield improvement is necessary to keep pace with increasing demand for 
food. Due to climatic variability, the incidence of drought stress at crop 
growth stages is becoming a major hindering factor to yield improvement. New 
techniques are required to increase drought tolerance along with improved yield. 
Genetic modification for increasing drought tolerance is highly desirable, and 
genetic engineering for drought tolerance requires the expression of certain 
stress-related genes. Genes have been identified which confer drought tolerance 
and improve plant growth and survival in transgenic wheat. However, less 
research has been conducted for the development of transgenic wheat as compared 
to rice, maize, and other staple food. Furthermore, enhanced tolerance to 
drought without any yield penalty is a major task of genetic engineering. In 
this review, we have focused on the progress in the development of transgenic 
wheat cultivars for improving drought tolerance and discussed the physiological 
mechanisms and testing of their tolerance in response to inserted genes under 
control or field conditions.
