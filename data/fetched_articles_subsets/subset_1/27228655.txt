Impaired metabolism of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and its aggregation are now 
implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies 
have found association between PD and gene locus, containing the SNCA gene. 
Meta-analysis have shown high significant association of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) rs356165 (A/G) and rs356219 (A/G) in the SNCA gene with PD. 
We genotyped these SNPs in 260 PD patients and 262 controls from north-western 
region of Russia. Alleles "G" of rs356165 and rs356219 were associated with 
increased risk of PD development. Linkage disequilibrium was shown between 
associated marker alleles. We studied the relationship between rs356165 and 
rs356219 and levels of mRNA SNCA and alpha-synuclein in CD45+ peripheral blood 
cells in drug-naive PD patients (n = 43) and controls (n = 39). Alleles "G" of 
rs356165 and rs356219 were associated with increased levels of SNCA expression 
(p = 0.046) and high alpha-synuclein levels (p = 0.039) in controls. Our data 
suggest that rs356165 and rs356219 variants might influence on PD development by 
upregulating SNCA expression.
