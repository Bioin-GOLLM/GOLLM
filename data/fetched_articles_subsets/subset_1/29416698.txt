Cancer stem cells reside in a distinct microenvironment called niche. The 
reciprocal interactions between cancer stem cells and niche contribute to the 
maintenance and enrichment of cancer stem cells. In order to simulate the 
interactions between cancer stem cells and niche, three-dimensional models have 
been developed. These in vitro culture systems recapitulate the spatial 
dimension, cellular heterogeneity, and the molecular networks of the tumor 
microenvironment and show great promise in elucidating the pathophysiology of 
cancer stem cells and designing more clinically relavant treatment modalites.
