BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The voltage-gated sodium channel Nav 1.7 is essential 
for adequate perception of painful stimuli. Mutations in the encoding gene, 
SCN9A, cause various pain syndromes in humans. The hNav 1.7/A1632E channel 
mutant causes symptoms of erythromelalgia and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder 
(PEPD), and its main gating change is a strongly enhanced persistent current. On 
the basis of recently published 3D structures of voltage-gated sodium channels, 
we investigated how the inactivation particle binds to the channel, how this 
mechanism is altered by the hNav 1.7/A1632E mutation, and how dimerization 
modifies function of the pain-linked mutation.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We applied atomistic molecular simulations to demonstrate 
the effect of the mutation on channel fast inactivation. Native PAGE was used to 
demonstrate channel dimerization, and electrophysiological measurements in HEK 
cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes were used to analyze the links between 
functional channel dimerization and impairment of fast inactivation by the hNav 
1.7/A1632E mutation.
KEY RESULTS: Enhanced persistent current through hNav 1.7/A1632E channels was 
caused by impaired binding of the inactivation particle, which inhibits proper 
functioning of the recently proposed allosteric fast inactivation mechanism. 
hNav 1.7 channels form dimers and the disease-associated persistent current 
through hNav 1.7/A1632E channels depends on their functional dimerization 
status: Expression of the synthetic peptide difopein, a 14-3-3 inhibitor known 
to functionally uncouple dimers, decreased hNav 1.7/A1632E channel-induced 
persistent currents.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Functional uncoupling of mutant hNav 1.7/A1632E 
channel dimers restored their defective allosteric fast inactivation mechanism. 
Our findings support the concept of sodium channel dimerization and reveal its 
potential relevance for human pain syndromes.
