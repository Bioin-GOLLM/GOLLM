O-Methylated stilbenes are prominent nutraceuticals but rarely produced by 
crops. Here, the inherent ability of two Saccharinae grasses to produce 
regioselectively O-methylated stilbenes is reported. A stilbene 
O-methyltransferase, SbSOMT, is first shown to be indispensable for 
pathogen-inducible pterostilbene (3,5-bis-O-methylated) biosynthesis in sorghum 
(Sorghum bicolor). Phylogenetic analysis indicates the recruitment of 
genus-specific SOMTs from canonical caffeic acid O-methyltransferases (COMTs) 
after the divergence of Sorghum spp. from Saccharum spp. In recombinant enzyme 
assays, SbSOMT and COMTs regioselectively catalyze O-methylation of stilbene 
A-ring and B-ring respectively. Subsequently, SOMT-stilbene crystal structures 
are presented. Whilst SbSOMT shows global structural resemblance to SbCOMT, 
molecular characterizations illustrate two hydrophobic residues (Ile144/Phe337) 
crucial for substrate binding orientation leading to 3,5-bis-O-methylations in 
the A-ring. In contrast, the equivalent residues (Asn128/Asn323) in SbCOMT 
facilitate an opposite orientation that favors 3'-O-methylation in the B-ring. 
Consistently, a highly-conserved COMT is likely involved in isorhapontigenin 
(3'-O-methylated) formation in wounded wild sugarcane (Saccharum spontaneum). 
Altogether, our work reveals the potential of Saccharinae grasses as a source of 
O-methylated stilbenes, and rationalize the regioselectivity of SOMT activities 
for bioengineering of O-methylated stilbenes.
