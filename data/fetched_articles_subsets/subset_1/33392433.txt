As percentages of elderly people rise in many societies, age-related diseases 
have become more prevalent than ever. Research interests have been shifting to 
delaying age-related diseases by delaying or reversing aging itself. We use 
metformin as an entry point to talk about the important molecular and genetic 
longevity-regulating mechanisms that have been extensively studied with it. Then 
we review a number of observational studies, animal studies, and clinical trials 
to reflect the clinical potentials of the mechanisms in lifespan extension, 
cardiovascular diseases, tumors, and neurodegeneration. Finally, we highlight 
remaining concerns that are related to metformin and future anti-aging research.
