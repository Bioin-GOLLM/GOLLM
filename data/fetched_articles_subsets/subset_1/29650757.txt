As newly synthesized polypeptides emerge from the ribosome, it is crucial that 
they fold correctly. To prevent premature aggregation, nascent chains interact 
with chaperones that facilitate folding or prevent misfolding until protein 
synthesis is complete. Nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is a 
ribosome-associated chaperone that is important for protein homeostasis. 
However, how NAC binds its substrates remains unclear. Using native electrospray 
ionization MS (ESI-MS), limited proteolysis, NMR, and cross-linking, we analyzed 
the conformational properties of NAC from Caenorhabditis elegans and studied its 
ability to bind proteins in different conformational states. Our results 
revealed that NAC adopts an array of compact and expanded conformations and 
binds weakly to client proteins that are unfolded, folded, or intrinsically 
disordered, suggestive of broad substrate compatibility. Of note, we found that 
this weak binding retards aggregation of the intrinsically disordered protein 
α-synuclein both in vitro and in vivo These findings provide critical insights 
into the structure and function of NAC. Specifically, they reveal the ability of 
NAC to exploit its conformational plasticity to bind a repertoire of substrates 
with unrelated sequences and structures, independently of actively translating 
ribosomes.
