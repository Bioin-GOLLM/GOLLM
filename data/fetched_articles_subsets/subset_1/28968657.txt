Intellectual disability affects 2-3% of the world's population and typically 
begins during childhood, causing impairments in social skills and cognitive 
abilities. Mutations in the TM4SF2 gene, which encodes the TSPAN7 protein, cause 
a severe form of intellectual disability, and currently, no therapy is able to 
ameliorate this cognitive impairment. We previously reported that, in cultured 
neurons, shRNA-mediated down-regulation of TSPAN7 affects AMPAR trafficking by 
enhancing PICK1-GluA2 interaction, thereby increasing the intracellular 
retention of AMPAR. Here, we found that loss of TSPAN7 function in mice causes 
alterations in hippocampal excitatory synapse structure and functionality as 
well as cognitive impairment. These changes occurred along with alterations in 
AMPAR expression levels. We also found that interfering with PICK1-GluA2 binding 
restored synaptic function in Tm4sf2-/y mice. Moreover, potentiation of AMPAR 
activity via the administration of the ampakine CX516 reverted the neurological 
phenotype observed in Tm4sf2-/y mice, suggesting that pharmacological modulation 
of AMPAR may represent a new approach for treating patients affected by TM4SF2 
mutations and intellectual disability.
