The purpose of the current study was to identify novel mutations in the FRMD7 
(FERM domain containing 7) gene and to characterize clinical features in Chinese 
patients with congenital motor nystagmus. For this purpose, 18 patients with 
congenital motor nystagmus were selected from the ocular genetic diseases bank 
of the Pediatric and Genetic Clinic of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (Guangdong, 
China). Direct sequencing was used to analyze the exons and adjacent introns of 
the FRMD7 gene. The heteroduplex‑single strand conformation polypeptide method 
was used to analyze 96 unrelated normal controls and gene‑screening positive 
patients. Slit lamp photography of the anterior segment, fundus photography, 
optical coherence tomography and electroretinogram were carried out to identify 
the clinical features of congenital motor nystagmus. The authors noted that in, 
18 patients with congenital motor nystagmus, there were 7FRMD7 gene mutations 
(six new mutations). The screening rate was 38.89%, including c.41_43delAGA 
(p.13‑15delK); c.473T>A (p.I158N); c.605T>A (p.I202N); c.580G>T (p.A194S); 
c.811T>A (p.C271S); c.1493insA (p.Y498X); c.57+1G>A (slice mutation). There were 
no such mutations in the 96 normal controls. These results enriched the gene 
mutation spectrum of FRMD7. The authors systematically investigated the clinical 
phenotype of congenital motor nystagmus in a Chinese population. The study 
provides further evidence for clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis and 
genetic counseling.
