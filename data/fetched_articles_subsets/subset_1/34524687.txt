BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is a scarcity of information regarding the role of 
prothrombin kringle-2 (pKr-2), which can be generated by active thrombin, in 
hippocampal neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: To assess the role of pKr-2 in association with the 
neurotoxic symptoms of AD, we determined pKr-2 protein levels in post-mortem 
hippocampal tissues of patients with AD and the hippocampi of five familial AD 
(5XFAD) mice compared with those of age-matched controls and wild-type (WT) 
mice, respectively. In addition, we investigated whether the hippocampal 
neurodegeneration and object memory impairments shown in 5XFAD mice were 
mediated by changes to pKr-2 up-regulation.
KEY RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that pKr-2 was up-regulated in the 
hippocampi of patients with AD and 5XFAD mice, but was not associated with 
amyloid-β aggregation in 5XFAD mice. The up-regulation of pKr-2 expression was 
inhibited by preservation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via addition of 
caffeine to their water supply or by treatment with rivaroxaban, an inhibitor of 
factor Xa that is associated with thrombin production. Moreover, the prevention 
of up-regulation of pKr-2 expression reduced neurotoxic symptoms, such as 
hippocampal neurodegeneration and object recognition decline due to neurotoxic 
inflammatory responses in 5XFAD mice.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: We identified a novel pathological mechanism of AD 
mediated by abnormal accumulation of pKr-2, which functions as an important 
pathogenic factor in the adult brain via blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. 
Thus, pKr-2 represents a novel target for AD therapeutic strategies and those 
for related conditions.
