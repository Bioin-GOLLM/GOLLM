The organization of eukaryotic genome in the nucleus, a double-membraned 
organelle separated from the cytoplasm, is highly complex and dynamic. The 
functional architecture of the nucleus is confined by the layers of internal and 
cytoplasmic elements, including chromatin organization, nuclear envelope 
associated proteome and transport, nuclear-cytoskeletal contacts, and the 
mechano-regulatory signaling cascades. The size and morphology of the nucleus 
could impose a significant impact on nuclear mechanics, chromatin organization, 
gene expression, cell functionality and disease development. The maintenance of 
nuclear organization during genetic or physical perturbation is crucial for the 
viability and lifespan of the cell. Abnormal nuclear envelope morphologies, such 
as invagination and blebbing, have functional implications in several human 
disorders, including cancer, accelerated aging, thyroid disorders, and different 
types of neuro-muscular diseases. Despite the evident interplay between nuclear 
structure and nuclear function, our knowledge about the underlying molecular 
mechanisms for regulation of nuclear morphology and cell functionality during 
health and illness is rather poor. This review highlights the essential nuclear, 
cellular, and extracellular components that govern the organization of nuclei 
and functional consequences associated with nuclear morphometric aberrations. 
Finally, we discuss the recent developments with diagnostic and therapeutic 
implications targeting nuclear morphology in health and disease.
