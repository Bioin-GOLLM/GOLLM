BACKGROUND: Mutations in kinetochore gene KNSTRN accelerate the development of 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and may correlate with different 
histological classifications of actinic keratosis (AKs).
OBJECTIVE: To determine KNSTRN gene mutation frequency in healthy skin (HS), 
actinically damaged skin (ADS), in AKs with different histomorphological 
gradings and invasive SCCs.
METHODS: All samples were histologically evaluated. AK lesions were additionally 
classified according to their upwards (AK I-III) and downwards (PRO I-III) 
directed growth pattern. Mutation analyses of all samples were performed using 
the Sanger method.
RESULTS: With one exception, all detected mutations in KNSTRN gene showed an 
alanine-to-glutamate substitution at codon 40 (p.Ala40Glu). p.Ala40Glu mutation 
was found in 6.9% (2/29) of HS, in 16.1% (5/31) of ADS, in 18.3% (20/109) of AKs 
and in 30.0% (9/30) of invasive SCCs. Further stratification of AKs using the 
common AK classification of Röwert-Huber revealed the p.Ala40Glu mutation in 
14.7% (5/43), 13.3% (4/30) and 24.4% (11/45) (AK I, II and III). In contrast, 
the new PRO classification showed a distribution of 3.6% (1/28) in PRO I, 21.7% 
(13/60) in PRO II and 28.6% (6/21) in PRO III. Mutation frequency in HS showed 
significant differences compared to AKs classified as PRO III and invasive SCCs 
(P < 0.05). In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences 
between HS and AKs when classified according to Röwert-Huber.
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent somatic mutation p.Ala40Glu in KNSTRN gene is associated 
with basal proliferating AKs in accordance with invasive SCCs. This supports the 
impact of basal proliferative pattern in terms of progression.
