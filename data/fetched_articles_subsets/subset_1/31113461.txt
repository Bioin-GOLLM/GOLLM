BACKGROUND: The aberrant expression of myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2) 
has been found in some cancers, but little is known about the roles and clinical 
relevance. The present study aimed to investigate the roles and clinical 
relevance of MTMR2 as well as the underlying mechanisms in gastric cancer (GC).
METHODS: MTMR2 expression was examined in 295 GC samples by using 
immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlation between MTMR2 expression and 
clinicopathological features and outcomes of the patients was analyzed. The 
roles of MTMR2 in regulating the invasive and metastatic capabilities of GC 
cells were observed using gain-and loss-of-function assays both in vitro and in 
vivo. The pathways involved in MTMR2-regulating invasion and metastasis were 
selected and identified by using mRNA expression profiling. Functions and 
underlying mechanisms of MTMR2-mediated invasion and metastasis were further 
investigated in a series of in vitro studies.
RESULTS: MTMR2 was highly expressed in human GC tissues compared to adjacent 
normal tissues and its expression levels were significantly correlated with 
depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. Patients with MTMR2high 
had significantly shorter lifespan than those with MTMR2low. Cox regression 
analysis showed that MTMR2 was an independent prognostic indicator for GC 
patients. Knockdown of MTMR2 significantly reduced migratory and invasive 
capabilities in vitro and metastases in vivo in GC cells, while overexpressing 
MTMR2 achieved the opposite results. MTMR2 knockdown and overexpression markedly 
inhibited and promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 
respectively. MTMR2 mediated EMT through the IFNγ/STAT1/IRF1 pathway to promote 
GC invasion and metastasis. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and IRF1 was increased by 
MTMR2 knockdown and decreased by MTMR2 overexpression accompanying with ZEB1 
down-regulation and up-regulation, respectively. Silencing IRF1 upregulated 
ZEB1, which induced EMT and consequently enhanced invasion and metastasis in GC 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that MTMR2 is an important promoter in GC 
invasion and metastasis by inactivating IFNγ/STAT1 signaling and may act as a 
new prognostic indicator and a potential therapeutic target for GC.
