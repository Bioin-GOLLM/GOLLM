Despite a century of intensive investigation the effective treatment of protein 
aggregation diseases remains elusive. Ordinarily, molecular chaperones ensure 
that proteins maintain their functional conformation. The appearance of 
misfolded proteins that aggregate implies the collapse of the cellular chaperone 
quality control network. That said, the cellular chaperone network is extensive 
and functional information regarding the detailed action of specific chaperones 
is not yet available. J proteins (DnaJ/Hsp40) are a family of chaperone 
cofactors that harness Hsc70 (heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa) for diverse 
conformational cellular tasks and, as such, represent novel clinically relevant 
targets for diseases resulting from the disruption of proteostasis. Here we 
review incisive reports identifying mutations in individual J protein chaperones 
and the proteostasis collapse that ensues.
