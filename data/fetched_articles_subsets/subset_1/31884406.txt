BACKGROUND: Nobiletin (N), a polymethoxylated flavone from citrus fruits, 
enhanced anti-cancer effects of paclitaxel (PTX) in multi-drug resistance (MDR) 
cancer cells via inhibiting P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in our previous report. But 
the in vivo chemo-sensitizing effect of nobiletin is unknown. Moreover, 
considering the nonlinear pharmacokinetics and narrow therapeutic window of PTX, 
drug-drug interaction should be explored for using nobiletin with PTX together.
PURPOSE: In this study, we wanted to explore whether nobiletin could affect the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior of PTX and reverse drug resistance in vivo as well 
as the corresponding mechanisms.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Accurate and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method was developed 
for the detection of PTX, and was applied to the pharmacokinetic study in rats. 
In vivo anti-MDR tumor study was carried out with A549/T xenograft nude mice 
model. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were used for evaluating 
the levels of P-gp, Nrf2, and AKT/ERK pathways in MDR tumors.
RESULTS: Nobiletin significantly enhanced the therapeutic effects of PTX, and 
inhibited the MDR tumor sizes in the A549/T xenograft model, while PTX or 
nobiletin alone did not. We found that nobiletin increased the PTX 
concentrations in tumor tissues but did not affect the PK behavior of PTX. 
Notably, Nrf2 and phosphorylation of AKT/ERK expression in MDR tumor tissues 
were significantly inhibited by giving nobiletin and PTX together. However, 
nobiletin did not affect the expression of P-gp.
CONCLUSION: Nobiletin reversed PTX resistance in MDR tumor via increasing the 
PTX content in the MDR tumor and inhibiting AKT/ERK/Nrf2 pathways, but without 
affecting the systematic exposure of PTX, indicating that nobiletin may be an 
effective and safe MDR tumor reversal agent.
