INTRODUCTION: Ceritinib is a second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 
inhibitor. It inhibits two of the most common ALK-mutants that confer resistance 
to crizotinib. Ceritinib was approved by Food and Drug Administration in April 
2014. However, the efficacy of ceritinib in Asian patients have not been widely 
studied. Decrease of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) has been rarely reported 
after treatment with ceritinib.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year old man diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma 
presented with MPE and an ALK fusion gene mutation. The patient showed partial 
response to ceritinib after 2-month treatment. Ultrasound showed MPE 
significantly decreased.
DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: Ceritinib is a good choice, as a targeted therapy, 
which is more prospect in the advanced cancer patients than the traditional 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: Ceritinib seems to have a good efficacy in reducing MPE in advanced 
Asian lung adenocarcinoma patients, when other chemotherapy failed.
