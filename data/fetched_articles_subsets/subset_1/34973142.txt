PURPOSE: Our understanding of inborn errors of immunity is increasing; however, 
their contribution to pediatric sepsis is unknown.
METHODS: We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to characterize variants in genes 
related to monogenic immunologic disorders in 330 children admitted to intensive 
care for severe sepsis. We defined candidate variants as rare variants 
classified as pathogenic or potentially pathogenic in QIAGEN's Human Gene 
Mutation Database or novel null variants in a disease-consistent inheritance 
pattern. We investigated variant correlation with infection and inflammatory 
phenotype.
RESULTS: More than one in two children overall and three of four African 
American children had immunodeficiency-associated variants. Children with 
variants had increased odds of isolating a blood or urinary pathogen (blood: OR 
2.82, 95% CI: 1.12-7.10, p = 0.023, urine: OR: 8.23, 95% CI: 1.06-64.11, 
p = 0.016) and demonstrating increased inflammation with hyperferritinemia 
(ferritin [Formula: see text] ng/mL, OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.28-3.66, p = 0.004), 
lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1000/µL, OR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.06 - 2.60, 
p = 0.027), thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150,000/µL, OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 
1.12-2.76, p = 0.013), and CRP greater than 10 mg/dl (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 
1.10-2.68, p = 0.017). They also had increased odds of requiring extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO, OR: 4.19, 95% CI: 1.21-14.5, p = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: Herein, we describe the genetic findings in this severe pediatric 
sepsis cohort and their microbiologic and immunologic significance, providing 
evidence for the phenotypic effect of these variants and rationale for screening 
children with life-threatening infections for potential inborn errors of 
immunity.
