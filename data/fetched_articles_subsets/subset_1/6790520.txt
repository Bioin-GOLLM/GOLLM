Position of the lacZX90 mutation and hybridization between complete and 
incomplete beta-galactosidase.

Mandecki W, Fowler AV, Zabin I.

The position of the termination codon in lacZX90 was determined by isolation of 
a lac+ revertant. Lysine was found to replace tyrosine at position 1,012 of 
beta-galactosidase, indicating that X90 protein lacked the carboxyl-terminal 10 
residues. A heat- and urea-sensitive hybrid enzyme was formed in vivo when supC, 
which supplies tyrosine to the position in the polypeptide corresponding to the 
nonsense codon, was used to suppress lacZX90. This result shows that suppression 
that adds back the original amino acid may not lead to the production of the 
wild-type enzyme if the latter is multimeric, because incomplete chains can be 
incorporated into the oligomer.
