Comparative analysis of the AIB1 interactome in breast cancer reveals MTA2 as a 
repressive partner which silences E-Cadherin to promote EMT and associates with 
a pro-metastatic phenotype.

Steroid regulated cancer cells use nuclear receptors and associated regulatory 
proteins to orchestrate transcriptional networks to drive disease progression. 
In primary breast cancer, the coactivator AIB1 promotes estrogen receptor (ER) 
transcriptional activity to enhance cell proliferation. The function of the 
coactivator in ER+ metastasis however is not established. Here we describe AIB1 
as a survival factor, regulator of pro-metastatic transcriptional pathways and a 
promising actionable target. Genomic alterations and functional expression of 
AIB1 associated with reduced disease-free survival in patients and enhanced 
metastatic capacity in novel CDX and PDX ex-vivo models of ER+ metastatic 
disease. Comparative analysis of the AIB1 interactome with complementary RNAseq 
characterized AIB1 as a transcriptional repressor. Specifically, we report that 
AIB1 interacts with MTA2 to form a repressive complex, inhibiting CDH1 (encoding 
E-cadherin) to promote EMT and drive progression. We further report that 
pharmacological and genetic inhibition of AIB1 demonstrates significant 
anti-proliferative activity in patient-derived models establishing AIB1 as a 
viable strategy to target endocrine resistant metastasis. This work defines a 
novel role for AIB1 in the regulation of EMT through transcriptional repression 
in advanced cancer cells with a considerable implication for prognosis and 
therapeutic interventions.
