Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), located on chromosome 22q11.2, encodes an 
enzyme critical for dopamine flux in the prefrontal cortex. Genetic variants of 
COMT have been suggested to functionally manipulate prefrontal morphology and 
function in healthy adults. This study aims to investigate modulative roles of 
individuals COMT SNPs (rs737865, val158met, rs165599) and its haplotypes in 
age-related brain morphology using an Asian sample with 174 adults aged from 21 
to 80 years. We showed an age-related decline in cortical thickness of the 
dorsal visual pathway, including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 
bilateral angular gyrus, right superior frontal cortex, and age-related shape 
compression in the basal ganglia as a function of the genotypes of the 
individual COMT SNPs, especially COMT val158met. Using haplotype trend 
regression analysis, COMT haplotype probabilities were estimated and further 
revealed an age-related decline in cortical thickness in the default mode 
network (DMN), including the posterior cingulate, precuneus, supramarginal and 
paracentral cortex, and the ventral visual system, including the occipital 
cortex and left inferior temporal cortex, as a function of the COMT haplotype. 
Our results provided new evidence on an antagonistic pleiotropic effect in COMT, 
suggesting that genetically programmed neural benefits in early life may have a 
potential bearing towards neural susceptibility in later life. Hum Brain Mapp
