PURPOSE: To determine whether the polymorphisms of calcitonin receptor-like 
receptor gene (CALCRL) are associated with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) 
in a southern Chinese population.
METHODS: A total of 207 individuals with acute and chronic PACG and 205 
ethnically matched controls were recruited in the current study. A tag-single 
nucleotide polymorphism approach was used to investigate this gene. Alleles were 
determined by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism.
RESULTS: The results show a nominal association between rs1157699 and acute PACG 
(uncorrected p=0.024 and 0.028 for alleles and genotypes, respectively). 
Haplotype T(rs840617)C(rs6759535)T(rs1157699) frequency is significantly higher 
in acute PACG patients than in controls (corrected p=0.012), whereas haplotype 
T(rs840617)C(rs6759535)C(rs1157699) frequency is significantly lower in acute 
PACG patients compared with controls (corrected p=0.02). However, no significant 
difference was detected between chronic PACG and CALCRL tag single nucleotide 
polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests a possible role of CALCRL in the pathogenesis of 
acute PACG but not chronic PACG. A replication of this study with a larger 
sample size as well as on different populations will be helpful in confirming 
this finding.
