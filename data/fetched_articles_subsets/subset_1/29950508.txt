Early breaches in B cell tolerance are central to type 1 diabetes progression in 
mouse and man. Conventional BCR transgenic mouse models (VH125.Tg NOD) reveal 
the power of B cell specificity to drive disease as APCs. However, in 
conventional fixed IgM models, comprehensive assessment of B cell development is 
limited. To provide more accurate insight into the developmental and functional 
fates of anti-insulin B cells, we generated a new NOD model (VH125SDNOD) in 
which anti-insulin VDJH125 is targeted to the IgH chain locus to generate a 
small (1-2%) population of class switch-competent insulin-binding B cells. 
Tracking of this rare population in a polyclonal repertoire reveals that 
anti-insulin B cells are preferentially skewed into marginal zone and late 
transitional subsets known to have increased sensitivity to proinflammatory 
signals. Additionally, IL-10 production, characteristic of regulatory B cell 
subsets, is increased. In contrast to conventional models, class 
switch-competent anti-insulin B cells proliferate normally in response to 
mitogenic stimuli but remain functionally silent for insulin autoantibody 
production. Diabetes development is accelerated, which demonstrates the power of 
anti-insulin B cells to exacerbate disease without differentiation into 
Ab-forming or plasma cells. Autoreactive T cell responses in VH125SDNOD mice are 
not restricted to insulin autoantigens, as evidenced by increased IFN-γ 
production to a broad array of diabetes-associated epitopes. Together, these 
results independently validate the pathogenic role of anti-insulin B cells in 
type 1 diabetes, underscore their diverse developmental fates, and demonstrate 
the pathologic potential of coupling a critical β cell specificity to 
predominantly proinflammatory Ag-presenting B cell subsets.
