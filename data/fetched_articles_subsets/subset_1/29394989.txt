Many variants of uncertain significance (VUS) have been identified in BRCA2 
through clinical genetic testing. VUS pose a significant clinical challenge 
because the contribution of these variants to cancer risk has not been 
determined. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of VUS in the BRCA2 
C-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) by using a validated functional assay of 
BRCA2 homologous recombination (HR) DNA-repair activity and defined a classifier 
of variant pathogenicity. Among 139 variants evaluated, 54 had ?99% probability 
of pathogenicity, and 73 had ?95% probability of neutrality. Functional assay 
results were compared with predictions of variant pathogenicity from the 
Align-GVGD protein-sequence-based prediction algorithm, which has been used for 
variant classification. Relative to the HR assay, Align-GVGD significantly (p < 
0.05) over-predicted pathogenic variants. We subsequently combined functional 
and Align-GVGD prediction results in a Bayesian hierarchical model (VarCall) to 
estimate the overall probability of pathogenicity for each VUS. In addition, to 
predict the effects of all other BRCA2 DBD variants and to prioritize variants 
for functional studies, we used the endoPhenotype-Optimized Sequence Ensemble 
(ePOSE) algorithm to train classifiers for BRCA2 variants by using data from the 
HR functional assay. Together, the results show that systematic functional 
assays in combination with in silico predictors of pathogenicity provide robust 
tools for clinical annotation of BRCA2 VUS.
