BACKGROUND: Pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) in the respiratory tract plays 
an important role in host. In the present, we assessed the association between 
SP-A gene polymorphism and allergic rhinitis.
METHODS: Using a case-control design, we compared the genotype frequencies of 
SP-A rs1965708 between allergic rhinitis patients and healthy control group. 
Genotyping was performed using real-time quantitative PCR-based molecular 
identification methods. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were 
performed to quantitatively assess the association between rs1965708 
polymorphism and allergic rhinitis, and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence 
interval (CI) were also calculated.
RESULTS: 500 patients with allergic rhinitis and 500 healthy controls were 
included in the study. Compared with the CC genotype, we found that AA genotype 
of rs1965708 could increase the allergic rhinitis risk in the univariate 
analysis (OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.56-4.54, p = 0.000). For dominant model, we found 
no significant difference in the dominant model (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.86-1.52, 
p = 0.367). In the recessive model, the CC genotype could elevate the risk of 
allergic rhinitis compared with CC + AA genotype (OR = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.61-4.54, 
p = 0.000). Similar results were also found in the allele model (OR = 1.28, 95% 
CI: 1.07-1.54, p = 0.008). Interactions between rs1965708 AA or AC and smoking 
increased the allergic rhinitis risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The rs1965708 variants of SP-A gene polymorphism are associated 
with allergic rhinitis, and the A allele could increase the allergic rhinitis 
risk. The AA SNP variants that interact with smoking may alter the 
susceptibility to allergic rhinitis.
