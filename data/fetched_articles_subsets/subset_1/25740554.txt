We have used probe-based molecular dynamics (pMD) simulations to search for 
interaction hotspots on the surface of the therapeutically highly relevant 
oncogenic K-Ras G12D. Combining the probe-based query with an ensemble-based 
pocket identification scheme and an analysis of existing Ras-ligand complexes, 
we show that (i) pMD is a robust and cost-effective strategy for binding site 
identification, (ii) all four of the previously reported ligand binding sites 
are suitable for structure-based ligand design, and (iii) in some cases probe 
binding and expanded sampling of configurational space enable pocket expansion 
and increase the likelihood of site identification. Furthermore, by comparing 
the distribution of hotspots in nonpocket-like regions with known protein- and 
membrane-interacting interfaces, we propose that pMD has the potential to 
predict surface patches responsible for protein-biomolecule interactions. These 
observations have important implications for future drug design efforts and will 
facilitate the search for potential interfaces responsible for the proposed 
transient oligomerization or interaction of Ras with other biomolecules in the 
cellular milieu.
