BACKGROUND: Peak left atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) can help identify left 
atrial appendage thrombus (LAAT) in patients with atrial fibrillation. 
Nevertheless, few studies have been performed in patients in sinus rhythm 
without established indications for anticoagulation but with increased risk of 
LAAT, such as heart failure (HF) with severe left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction patients. The primary aim of this study was to identify clinical and 
transthoracic echocardiography predictors of LAAT in HF patients with very low 
left ventricular ejection fraction and sinus rhythm. The secondary objective was 
to analyze frequencies and predictors of a composite clinical endpoint of death 
or hospitalization for ischemic stroke.
METHODS: We included 63 patients with HF, left ventricular ejection fraction 
< 25%, sinus rhythm at presentation, no history of atrial fibrillation, and 
without any established indications for anticoagulation. We determined whether 
clinical and transthoracic echocardiography parameters, including left atrial 
strain analysis, predicted LAAT. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed 
in all patients. When LAAT was detected, anticoagulation was recommended. The 
participants were followed for a median of 28.6 months (range 4-40) to determine 
the composite endpoint.
RESULTS: LAAT was found in 20 (31.7%) patients. Global PALS was the best 
independent predictor of LAAT in univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses (Gini coefficient 0.65, area under the receiver-operating 
characteristic curve 0.83). A global PALS value below 8% was a good 
discriminator of LAAT presence (odds ratio 30.4, 95% CI 7.2-128, p <  0.001). 
During follow-up, 18 subjects (28.6%) reached the composite clinical endpoint. 
CHA2DS2-VASc score, use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or 
angiotensin receptor blockers, and body surface area were significant predictors 
for the composite endpoint of death or hospitalization for ischemic stroke in 
the multivariate regression model.
CONCLUSIONS: LAAT was relatively common in our group of HF patients and PALS has 
shown prognostic potential in LAAT identification. Further research is needed to 
determine whether initiation of anticoagulation or additional screening 
supported by PALS measurements will improve clinical outcomes in these patients.
