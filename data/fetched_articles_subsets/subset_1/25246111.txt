The gene PGRMC1 is highly expressed in the granulose and luteal cells of rodent 
and primate ovaries. Its role in anti-apoptosis and regulating cell-cycle 
progression suggests a role in regulating follicle growth. The hypothesis is 
supported by the study in mice and studies in Sweden. In this study, the coding 
exons of PGRMC1 were sequenced among 196 Chinese women with premature ovarian 
failure (POF) and 200 controls, and one novel missense mutation was identified 
(C.556C>T, p. Pro186Ser) in the POF group and one novel SNP (C.533C>T, p. 
Trh177Ile) was identified in both groups. The mutation is not considered 
causative because protein prediction did not indicate a deleterious effect. It 
is concluded that coding mutations of PGRMC1 do not seem to be a common cause of 
the disease in Han Chinese women. Future studies in larger cohorts from other 
ethnic groups are necessary to establish the role of PGRMC1 in POF.
