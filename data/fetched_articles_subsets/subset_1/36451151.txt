BACKGROUND: Fibronectin glomerulopathy is a rare, familial glomerular disease 
characterized by mesangial fibronectin deposition in the glomeruli. It is caused 
by the genetic defect in fibronectin and does not involve the activation of the 
immune system. Therefore, glomerular immunoglobulin and complement staining is 
generally absent or weak. Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) is an increasing cause of 
renal lesion, featured by light chain (κ or λ) and/or heavy chain restriction in 
glomeruli. Herein, we report a case of fibronectin glomerulopathy presenting as 
strong IgA and C3 immunostaining in renal biopsy, concomitant with monoclonal 
gammopathy (monoclonal IgA κ).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old female was admitted to our hospital for 
one-month pedal edema. The serum albumin of 19.6 g/l, and the 24-h urine protein 
was 15.092 g. Immunofixation electrophoresis displayed monoclonal IgA. The renal 
biopsy showed the mesangial deposits positive for IgA (3+) and C3 (3+) and also 
for IgG (2+), IgM (2+), and C1q (2+) IF microscopy. In addition, the staining 
intensity of light chain κ was slight greater than that of light chain λ. The 
glomerular deposits were strongly positive by FN by immuohistochemistry. The 
patient was treated with bortezomib, dexamethasone in combination with 
cyclophosphamide and gained partial remission.
CONCLUSION: We present the first FNG patient with strong IgA and C3 
immunostaining in the context of monoclonal IgA κ in the circulation. Perhaps 
FNG, monoclonal IgA κ and immune activation are potentially interplayed and 
eventually induce renal injuries.
