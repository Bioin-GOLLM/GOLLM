Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized 
by wide clinical and biological heterogeneity, with a large proportion of ALS 
patients also exhibiting frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum symptoms. This 
project aimed to characterize risk subtypes of the H1 haplotype within the MAPT 
(microtubule-associated protein tau) gene, according to their possible effect as 
a risk factor and as a modifying factor in relation to the age of disease onset. 
One hundred patients from Bulgaria with sporadic ALS were genotyped for the 
variants rs1467967, rs242557, rs1800547, rs3785883, rs2471738, and rs7521. 
Haploview 4.2 and SHEsisPlus were used to reconstruct haplotype frequencies 
using genotyping data from the 1000 Genomes project as controls. 
Genotype-phenotype correlation was investigated in the context of age of disease 
onset and risk of disease development. While the individual variants of the 
subtypes do not influence the age of onset of the disease, a correlation was 
found between the specific haplotype GGAGCA (H1b) and the risk of developing 
sALS, with results showing that individuals harboring this haplotype have a 
nearly two-fold increased risk of developing sALS compared to other H1 subtypes. 
The results from this study suggest that fine transcriptional regulation at the 
MAPT locus can influence the risk of ALS.
