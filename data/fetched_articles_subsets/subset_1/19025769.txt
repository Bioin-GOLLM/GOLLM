G-protein-coupled receptor 61 (GPR61) is an orphan receptor that is abundantly 
expressed in the brain, which suggests its involvement in various physiological 
functions in the central nervous system. It couples with Gs and shows 
constitutive activity. To investigate the role of the N-terminal segment in the 
constitutive activity of GPR61, we measured [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding using a 
GPR61-Gs fusion protein and derivatives that had a deletion or alanine mutation 
in the N-terminal segment. We found that deletion of the N-terminal 25 amino 
acids and the V19A mutation in GPR61 impaired its constitutive activity. 
Moreover, the loss of the constitutive activity of the mutants could be restored 
by adding a fusion protein containing a C-terminal CD8 single transmembrane 
domain and the N-terminal 48-amino-acid segment of GPR61, i.e., CD8-48. We 
conclude that the N-terminal domain of GPR61 is required for maintaining its 
constitutive activity and functions as a tethered intramolecular ligand.
