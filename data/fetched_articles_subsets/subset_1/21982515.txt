BACKGROUND: SB623 cells are expanded from marrow stromal cells (MSCs) 
transfected with a Notch intracellular domain (NICD)-expressing plasmid. In 
stroke-induced animals, these cells reduce infarct size and promote functional 
recovery. SB623 cells resemble the parental MSCs with respect to morphology and 
cell surface markers despite having been in extended culture. MSCs are known to 
have immunosuppressive properties; whether long-term culture of MSCs impact 
their immunomodulatory activity has not been addressed.
METHODS: To assess the possible senescent properties of SB623 cells, we 
performed cell cycle related assays and beta-galactosidase staining. To assess 
the immunomodulatory activity of these expanded NICD-transfected MSCs, we 
performed co-cultures of SB623 cells or MSCs with either enriched human T cells 
or monocytes and assessed cytokine production by flow cytometry. In addition, we 
monitored the immunosuppressive activity of SB623 cells in both allogenic and 
xenogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR).
RESULTS: Compared to MSCs, we showed that a small number of senescent-like cells 
appear in each lot of SB623 cells. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that these 
cells suppress human T cell proliferation in both the allogeneic and xenogeneic 
mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) in a manner comparable to MSCs. IL-10 producing 
T cells were generated and monocyte-dendritic cell differentiation was dampened 
by co-culture with SB623 cells. Compared to the parental MSCs, SB623 cells 
appear to exert a greater inhibitory impact on the maturation of dendritic cells 
as demonstrated by a greater reduction in the surface expression of the 
co-stimulatory molecule, CD86.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the immunosuppressive activity of the 
expanded NICD-transfected MSCs is comparable to the parental MSCs, in spite of 
the appearance of a small number of senescent-like cells.
