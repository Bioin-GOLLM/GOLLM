BACKGROUND: Myoclonus-Dystonia syndrome (M-D) is an autosomal-dominant movement 
disorder related to SGCE gene pathogenic variants. Although there can be 
observed variability in clinical findings, here we describe intrafamilial 
variability in a Turkish family with a novel nonsense SGCE pathogenic variant.
METHODS: A family with variable clinical symptoms resembling M-D were referred 
to our clinic. After preliminary diagnosis, patients were tested for mutations 
in the SGCE gene by Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: Novel pathogenic heterozygous nonsense mutation in exon 3, c.272T>G; 
p.Leu91* (NM_003919.2) were observed in affected family members.
CONCLUSION: Intrafamilial clinical variability, despite the same pathogenic 
variant described in this work, suggests that there are regulatory factors, 
epigenetic or environmental modifiers, which are the subject of a matter for 
future studies.
