AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the antidepressant potential 
of (4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl) (quinoxalin-3-yl) methanone (4a), a novel 5-HT(3) 
receptor antagonist, with an optimal log P (2.84) and pA(2) value (7.3) greater 
than ondansetron (6.9) using rodent behavioural models of depression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Swiss albino mice were used in actophotometer test, 
forced swim test (FST) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) induced head twitch 
response. Reserpine induced hypothermia (RIH) and olfactory bulbectomy were 
performed in male Wistar rats. Statistical analysis was carried out by using 
one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test.
RESULTS: Acute treatment of 4a (1-4 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice produced 
antidepressant-like effects in FST without affecting the baseline locomotion in 
actophotometer test. Further, 4a (2-4 mg/kg, i.p.) potentiated the 5-HTP induced 
head twitches response in mice and also antagonized RIH in rats. Furthermore, 
sub-chronic (14 days) treatment with 4a (2-4 mg/ kg, p.o.) significantly 
attenuated the behavioural anomalies induced by bilateral olfactory bulbectomy 
in rats in modified open field exploration.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary investigations confirm that 4a exhibits 
antidepressant-like activity in behaviour based rodent models of depression.
