BACKGROUND: The outbreak, and pandemic of COVID-19 causing widespread concerns 
in all health systems of countries. Virus-carrying aerosols can penetrate the 
healthy human body and lungs, resulting in rapid transmission. For the first 
time, in this evidence-based article, the effects of different types of 
mouthwashes to reduce the viral load were investigated. Also, another aim of 
this essay is a reduction in viral load in patients with COVID-19 and prevention 
developing ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients.
METHODS: Related databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies. 
The present study was performed according to the preferred cases for standard 
systematic reviews (PRISMA).
RESULTS: Five original studies in which the subject matter was directly 
evaluated were included. Different types of mouthwashes and viruses were 
investigated in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: The antiviral mouthwashes play a certainly important role in 
reducing the viral load of the salivary virus. In the present study, this 
importance could be proved in two different aspects, that is, the use of 
mouthwash before dental procedures to reduce the risk of transmission of the 
virus to the dental team and the use of this mouthwash in COVID-19 patients to 
help improve systemic problems associated with oral microbial flora.
