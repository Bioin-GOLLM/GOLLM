p40(phox) activated phagocyte NADPH oxidase without p47(phox) in a cell-free 
system consisting of p67(phox), Rac and cytochrome b(558) relipidated with 
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. The activation reached to 70% of that by 
p47(phox). Addition of p47(phox) slightly increased the activation, but not 
additively. p40(phox) improved the efficiency of p67(phox) in the activation. 
The C-terminus-truncated p67(phox), p40(phox)(D289A), p40(phox)(R58A), or 
p40(phox)(W207R) showed an impaired activation. A peptide corresponding to the 
p22(phox) Pro-rich region suppressed the activation, and far-western blotting 
revealed its interaction with p40(phox) SH3 domain. Thus, p40(phox) can 
substitute for p47(phox) in the activation, interacting with p22(phox) and 
p67(phox) through their specific regions.
