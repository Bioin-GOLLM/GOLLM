The term 'undruggable' was coined to describe proteins that could not be 
targeted pharmacologically. However, progress is being made to 'drug' many of 
these targets, and therefore more appropriate terms might be 'difficult to drug' 
or 'yet to be drugged'. Many desirable targets in cancer fall into this 
category, including the RAS and MYC oncogenes, and pharmacologically targeting 
these intractable proteins is now a key challenge in cancer research that 
requires innovation and the development of new technologies. In this Viewpoint 
article, we asked four scientists working in this field for their opinions on 
the most crucial advances, as well as the challenges and what the future holds 
for this important area of research.
