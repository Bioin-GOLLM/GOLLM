Ebola virus (EBOV) causes highly pathogenic disease in primates. Through 
screening a library of human interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), we identified 
TRIM25 as a potent inhibitor of EBOV transcription-and-replication-competent 
virus-like particle (trVLP) propagation. TRIM25 overexpression inhibited the 
accumulation of viral genomic and messenger RNAs independently of the RNA sensor 
RIG-I or secondary proinflammatory gene expression. Deletion of TRIM25 strongly 
attenuated the sensitivity of trVLPs to inhibition by type-I interferon. The 
antiviral activity of TRIM25 required ZAP and the effect of type-I interferon 
was modulated by the CpG dinucleotide content of the viral genome. We find that 
TRIM25 interacts with the EBOV vRNP, resulting in its autoubiquitination and 
ubiquitination of the viral nucleoprotein (NP). TRIM25 is recruited to incoming 
vRNPs shortly after cell entry and leads to dissociation of NP from the vRNA. We 
propose that TRIM25 targets the EBOV vRNP, exposing CpG-rich viral RNA species 
to restriction by ZAP.
