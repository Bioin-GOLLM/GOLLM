OBJECTIVE: To address the hypothesis that type II ovarian carcinoma, mutation of 
p53 and plasma levels of particular cytokines are associated with the generation 
of p53-specific serum autoantibody (AAb) responses in patients.
METHODS: Levels of CA125, 17 cytokines and AAbs to tumor-associated antigens 
including p53 were measured in plasma of 130 gynecologic tumor patients and 84 
healthy controls. TP53 exons 4-9 were sequenced in tumor specimens.
RESULTS: p53 AAbs are associated with high grade, but not low grade ovarian 
carcinoma. Seropositivity for p53 AAb occurred only in those ovarian carcinoma 
patients whose tumors contained mutated TP53, regardless of the exon targeted. 
Higher p53 AAb levels were detected in ovarian carcinoma patients who had higher 
stage disease, but p53 AAb levels were not correlated with CA125 levels. Among 
high-grade carcinoma patients, there was no relationship between p53 AAb 
seropositivity and seropositivity to other tumor-associated antigens tested, 
CA125 level or survival outcome. Both high and low grade ovarian carcinoma 
patients exhibited elevated levels of IL6, IL8 and IL10 as compared to healthy 
volunteers, although increased levels of IL5, MCP1, MIP1 and TNFalpha were 
associated only with high grade and advanced disease. Higher levels of p53AAb 
responses were correlated with elevated circulating IL4 and IL12, but reduced 
IL8 levels.
CONCLUSION: Type II, but not type I, ovarian carcinoma patients had elevated 
serum levels of p53 AAb. P53 AAb is associated with mutation of TP53, higher 
plasma IL4 and IL12 but lower plasma IL8 levels and no survival advantage.
