To exploit fully the potential of current sequencing technologies for 
population-based studies, one must enrich for loci from the human genome. Here 
we evaluate the hybridization-based approach by using oligonucleotide capture 
probes in solution to enrich for approximately 3.9 Mb of sequence target. We 
demonstrate that the tiling probe frequency is important for generating sequence 
data with high uniform coverage of targets. We obtained 93% sensitivity to 
detect SNPs, with a calling accuracy greater than 99%.
