Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. 
Recently a juvenile ALS patient was reported carrying the c.757delG mutation of 
the sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) gene, which was also a related mutation of 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN). 
ALS shares pathogenesis and overlapping genes with CMT and dHMN. We used 
whole-exome sequencing technology to screen the full-length SORD gene in 601 
Chinese sporadic ALS patients and 174 controls without a history of neurological 
diseases. No SORD pathogenic variants were identified in the ALS patients. Our 
current results did not find an association between SORD and ALS in Chinese 
patients, and further studies will be required.
