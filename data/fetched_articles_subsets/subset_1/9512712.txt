In Escherichia coli, RecA-mediated cleavage of LexA repressor is a key 
regulatory event required for expression of SOS genes involved in the repair of 
DNA damage. RecA also mediates the cleavage of UmuD protein to UmuD, a form 
active in SOS mutagenesis. To determine whether LexA and UmuD have common 
binding determinants on RecA, we have compared the ability of several recA 
mutants to function in the cleavage of LexA versus UmuD in vivo. The data reveal 
that while some recA mutations at Pro67 have a similar effect on LexA and UmuD 
cleavage, others have striking differential effects. For example, a Pro67-->Trp 
mutation results in a high level of constitutive cleavage of both proteins. 
However, Pro67-->Asp and Glu mutations promote constitutive cleavage of LexA and 
reduce induction of UmuD cleavage to just 5 to 10% of wild-type activity. In 
contrast, Pro67-->Arg prevents LexA cleavage while allowing nearly 50% of 
wild-type induction of UmuD cleavage. These results are consistent with the idea 
that Pro67 is located at a site in the nucleoprotein filament where both LexA 
and UmuD contact RecA.
