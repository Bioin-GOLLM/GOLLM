The title compound, C20H18O3, crystallizes in the space group P21/c with one 
mol-ecule in the asymmetric unit of the cell. The fluorene skeleton is nearly 
planar and the crystal structure is composed of mol-ecular layers extending 
parallel to the (302) plane. Within a layer, one formyl oxygen atom participates 
in the formation of a Carene-H⋯O bond, which is responsible for the formation of 
an inversion symmetric supra-molecular motif of graph set R 2 2(10). A second 
oxygen atom is involved in an intra-molecular Carene-H⋯O hydrogen bond and is 
further connected with a formyl hydrogen atom of an adjacent mol-ecule. A 
Hirshfeld surface analysis indicated that the most important contributions to 
the overall surface are from H⋯H (46.9%), O⋯H (27.9%) and C⋯H (17.8%) 
inter-actions.
