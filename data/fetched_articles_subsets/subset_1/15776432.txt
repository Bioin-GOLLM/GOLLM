Cystic fibrosis (CF) is mainly caused by mutations that interfere with the 
biosynthetic folding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) chloride channel. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of 
dysfunction of a disease-causing mutation associated with variable phenotypes. 
In order to attain these objectives, we studied the effect of the p.L206W 
mutation on CFTR protein production and function, and we examined the 
genotype-phenotype correlation of [p.L206W]+[p.F508del] patients. We showed that 
p.L206W is a processing (class II) mutation since the CFTR biosynthetic pathway 
was severely impaired, whereas single-channel measurements indicated ion 
conductance similar to the wild-type protein. These data raise the larger 
question of the phenotypic variability of class II mutants, including p.F508del. 
Since multiple potential partners could modify the processing of the CFTR 
protein during its course to the cell surface, environmental and other genetic 
factors might contribute to this variability.
