BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD and AFLD, 
respectively) are major health problems, as patients with either condition can 
progress to hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Although histologically similar, 
key differences likely exist in these two models. For example, altered content 
of several vesicle trafficking proteins have been identified in AFLD, but their 
content in NAFLD is unknown. In this study, we compared select parameters in 
NAFLD and AFLD in a rat model.
METHODS: We fed either Lieber- DeCarli liquid control or alcohol-containing (35 
% as calories) diet (AFLD model) or lean or high-fat (12 or 60 % derived from 
fat, respectively) pellets (NAFLD model) for 8-10 weeks, n = 8 in each model. 
Serum, hepatocytes and liver tissue were analyzed. Liver injury markers were 
measured in serum, triglyceride content and endocytosis (binding and 
internalization of (125)I- asialoorosomucoid) was measured in isolated 
hepatocytes, and content of selected trafficking proteins (Rab3D, Rab7 and 
Rab18) were determined in whole liver tissue.
RESULTS: Although liver injury markers and triglyceride content were similar in 
both models, binding and internalization of (125)I- asialoorosomucoid was 
significantly impaired in the hepatocytes from AFLD, but not NAFLD, animals. In 
addition, protein content of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) and three 
trafficking proteins, Rab3D, Rab7and Rab18, were significantly decreased after 
alcohol, but not high-fat feeding. Levels of protein carbonylation, amount of 
glutathione stores, and lipid peroxidation were similar irrespective of the 
insult to the livers that resulted in fatty liver.
CONCLUSION: Impairments in protein trafficking in AFLD are likely a direct 
result of alcohol administration, and not a function of fatty liver.
