Antimicrobial peptides are one of the lines of defense produced by several hosts 
in response to bacterial infections. Inspired by them and recent discoveries of 
xanthones as bacterial efflux pump inhibitors, chiral amides with a xanthone 
scaffold were planned to be potential antimicrobial adjuvants. The chiral 
derivatives of xanthones were obtained by peptide coupling reactions between 
suitable xanthones with enantiomerically pure building blocks, yielding 
derivatives with high enantiomeric purity. Among 18 compounds investigated for 
their antimicrobial activity against reference strains of bacteria and fungi, 
antibacterial activity for the tested strains was not found. Selected compounds 
were also evaluated for their potential to inhibit bacterial efflux pumps. 
Compound (R,R)-8 inhibited efflux pumps in the Gram-positive model tested and 
three compounds, (S,S)-8, (R)-17 and (R,S)-18, displayed the same activity in 
the Gram-negative strain used. Studies were performed on the inhibition of 
biofilm formation and quorum-sensing, to which the enantiomeric pair 8 displayed 
activity for the latter. To gain a better understanding of how the active 
compounds bind to the efflux pumps, docking studies were performed. Hit 
compounds were proposed for each activity, and it was shown that 
enantioselectivity was noticeable and must be considered, as enantiomers 
displayed differences in activity.
