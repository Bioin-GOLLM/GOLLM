BACKGROUND: STAT1 gain-of-function (GOF) is a primary immune dysregulatory 
disorder marked by wide infectious predisposition (most notably chronic 
mucocutaneous Candidiasis), autoimmunity, vascular disease and malignant 
predisposition. While atopic features have been described in some STAT1 GOF 
patients, they are not considered a predominant feature of the disease. 
Additionally, while eosinophilic gastrointestinal infiltration has been reported 
in some cases, this has always been described in the context of pre-existing 
oropharyngeal and/or esophageal Candidiasis.
CLINICAL CASES: Herein, we report 3 members of a multi-generational family 
diagnosed with STAT1 GOF caused by a novel mutation in the N-terminal domain, 
c.194A>C (p.D65A). The proband presented initially with a long-standing history 
of treatment-refractory eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) without preceding 
gastrointestinal tract fungal infections, and her mother was diagnosed with 
esophagitis as well.
CONCLUSION: EoE has been previously associated with alterations to STAT6 and 
STAT3 signaling pathways. The current report expands the possible association 
between JAK/STAT-related disorders and EoE, suggesting that EoE could be a 
primary disease manifestation of STAT1 GOF, even in the absence of oropharyngeal 
and/or esophageal Candidiasis.
