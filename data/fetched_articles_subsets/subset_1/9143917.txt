X-linked Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (XLFEVR) is a hereditary eye 
disorder that affects both the retina and the vitreous body. It is characterized 
by an abnormal vascularization of the peripheral retina. It has been previously 
shown by linkage and candidate gene analysis that XLFEVR and Norrie disease are 
allelic. In this report we describe four novel mutations (R41K, H42R, K58N, and 
Y120C) in the Norrie disease gene associated with one X-linked and four sporadic 
cases of FEVR. One mutation (H42R) was found to be segregating with the disease 
in three generations (X-linked family), and the others are sporadic. These 
sequence alterations changed the encoded amino acids in the Norrie disease 
protein and were not found in 17 unaffected family members or in 36 randomly 
selected normal individuals. This study provides additional evidence that 
mutations in the same gene can result in FEVR and Norrie disease. It also 
demonstrates that it may be beneficial for clinical diagnosis to screen for 
mutations in the Norrie disease gene in sporadic FEVR cases.
