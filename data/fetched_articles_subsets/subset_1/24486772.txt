Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) and familial 
hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) are allelic disorders of the gene CACNA1A 
encoding the P/Q subunit of a voltage gated calcium channel. While SCA6 is 
related to repeat expansions affecting the C-terminal part of the protein, EA2 
and FHM phenotypes are usually associated with nonsense and missense mutations 
leading to impaired channel properties. In three unrelated families with 
dominant cerebellar ataxia, symptoms cosegregated with CACNA1A missense 
mutations of evolutionary highly conserved amino acids (exchanges p.E668K, 
p.R583Q and p.D302N). To evaluate pathogenic effects, in silico, protein 
modeling analyses were performed which indicate structural alterations of the 
novel mutation p.E668K within the homologous domain 2 affecting CACNA1A protein 
function. The phenotype is characterised by a very slowly progressive ataxia, 
while ataxic episodes or migraine are uncommon. These findings enlarge the 
phenotypic spectrum of CACNA1A mutations.
