The distribution and morphology of neurons containing neuronal nitric oxide 
synthase (NOS), and calcium-binding proteins calbindin D28K and calretinin in 
the hamster visual cortex were compared by immunocytochemistry. Staining for 
NOS, calbindin D28K and calretinin was seen both in the specific layers and in 
the selective cell types. The densest concentration of anti-NOS-immunoreactive 
(IR) neurons was found in layer VI. Most of the calbindin D28K-IR neurons were 
located in layers II/III and V while the calretinin-IR neurons were 
predominantly located in layers II/III. The labeled neurons varied in 
morphology. The large majority of NOS-IR neurons were round or oval cells with 
many dendrites coursing in all directions. The majority of the calbindin D28K-IR 
neurons were stellate and round or oval cells with multipolar dendrites. The 
majority of the calretinin-IR neurons were vertical fusiform cells with long 
processes traveling perpendicular to the pial surface. Our study showed that 
14.7% and 27.5% of the NOS-IR cells in the hamster visual cortex contained 
calbindin D28K or calretinin, respectively. These results indicate that NOS, 
calbindin and calretinin are located in specific layers and specific cell types 
and the vast majority of NOS-containing neurons are limited to neurons that do 
not express calbindin D28K or calretinin.
