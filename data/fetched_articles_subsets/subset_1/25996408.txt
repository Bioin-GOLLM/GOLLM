Microscopy and micro-irradiation imaging techniques have significantly advanced 
our knowledge of DNA damage tolerance and the assembly of DNA repair proteins at 
the sites of damage. While these tools have been extensively applied to the 
study of nucleotide excision repair and double-strand break repair, their 
application to the repair of oxidatively-induced base lesions and single-strand 
breaks is just beginning to yield new insights. This review will focus on 
examining micro-irradiation techniques reported to create base lesions and 
single-strand breaks; these lesions are considered to be primarily addressed by 
proteins involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. By examining 
conditions for generating these DNA lesions and reviewing information on the 
assembly and dissociation of repair complexes at the induced lesion sites, we 
hope to promote further investigations into BER and to stimulate further 
development and enhancement of these techniques for the study of BER.
