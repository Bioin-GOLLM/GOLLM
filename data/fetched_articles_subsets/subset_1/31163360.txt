INTRODUCTION: Approximately 60% of congenital pediatric hearing loss is of 
genetic etiology. To evaluate non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSSNHL), 
guidelines emphasize the use of comprehensive genetic testing (CGT) with next 
generation sequencing (NGS), yet these tests have limited accessibility, and 
potential CGT results may not be well understood. Thus, our objective was to 
analyze genetic testing practices and results for pediatric patients with 
NSSNHL.
METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients (<18 years) 
diagnosed with NSSNHL from 2014 to 2017 at a tertiary pediatric hospital. 
Demographics, clinical data, CGT results, genetic testing practices and referral 
patterns were recorded and descriptively analyzed. Logistic regression models 
identified patient characteristics associated with pathogenic variants (PV) and 
variants of unknown significance (VOUS).
RESULTS: 430 patients with congenital NSSNHL were included in the study. Genetic 
testing was ordered for 28% (n = 122) and resulted for 16% (n = 68). Most of the 
ordered tests (89%, n = 109) were the CGT panel. A majority (62%, n = 97) of the 
time in which genetic testing was not ordered, a referral for genetics 
consultation was placed. Amongst those with CGT results, a definitive genetic 
etiology was identified in 25% (n = 13), with less than half due to variants of 
GJB2/6. At least one PV was identified for 33% (n = 18), while at least one VOUS 
for 93% (n = 51). There were no significant differences in PV presence or number 
of VOUS across any characteristic except race. When compared to Caucasians, 
African Americans had significantly higher rates of VOUS with a rate ratio and 
95% CI of 1.61 [1.11-2.34], p = 0.01, and Asians trended towards higher rates 
(1.96 [0.95-4.05], p = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: CGT is of high utility in the identification of relevant genetic 
variants and definitive genetic etiologies for pediatric patients with NSSNHL. 
Though guidelines recommend the early use of CGT, there are many barriers to 
appropriate testing and counseling, leading to low rates of CGT use at this 
single institution.
