The molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) uses a variety of immune evasion 
strategies to antagonize host immune responses. Two MCV proteins, MC159 and 
MC160, contain tandem death effector domains (DEDs). They are reported to 
inhibit innate immune signaling events such as NF-κB and IRF3 activation, and 
apoptosis. The RxDL motif of MC159 is required for inhibition of both apoptosis 
and NF-κB activation. However, the role of the conserved RxDL motif in the MC160 
DEDs remained unknown. To answer this question, we performed alanine mutations 
to neutralize the arginine and aspartate residues present in the MC160 RxDL in 
both DED1 and DED2. These mutations were further modeled against the structure 
of the MC159 protein. Surprisingly, the RxDL motif was not required for MC160's 
ability to inhibit MAVS-induced IFNβ activation. Further, unlike previous 
results with the MC159 protein, mutations within the RxDL motif of MC160 had no 
effect on the ability of MC160 to dampen TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. 
Molecular modeling predictions revealed no overall changes to the structure in 
the MC160 protein when the amino acids of both RxDL motifs were mutated to 
alanine (DED1 = R67A D69A; DED2 = R160A D162A). Taken together, our results 
demonstrate that the RxDL motifs present in the MC160 DEDs are not required for 
known functions of the viral protein.
