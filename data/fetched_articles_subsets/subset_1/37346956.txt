C-N cross-coupling bond formation reactions have become valuable approaches to 
synthesizing anilines and their derivatives, known as important chemical 
compounds. Recent developments in this field have focused on versatile 
catalysts, simple operation methods, and green reaction conditions. This review 
article presents an overview of C-N cross-coupling reactions in pharmaceutical 
compound synthesis reports. Selected examples of N-arylation reactions of 
various nitrogen-based compounds and aryl halides are defined for preparing 
pharmaceutical molecules.
