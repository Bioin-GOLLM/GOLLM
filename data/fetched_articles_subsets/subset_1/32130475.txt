Apathy is prevalent in first-episode psychosis (FEP) and associated with reduced 
global functioning. Investigations of the trajectory of apathy and its early 
predictors are needed to develop new treatment interventions. We here measured 
the levels of apathy over the first 10 years of treatment in FEP and in healthy 
controls (HC). We recruited 198 HC and 198 FEP participants. We measured apathy 
with the Apathy Evaluation Scale, self-report version, psychotic symptoms with 
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, depression with the Calgary Depression 
Scale for Schizophrenia, functioning with the Global Assessment of Functioning 
Scale, and also estimated the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP). The 
longitudinal development of apathy and its predictors were explored using linear 
mixed models analyses. Associations to functioning at 10 years were investigated 
using multiple hierarchical linear regression analyses. In HC, mean apathy 
levels were low and stable. In FEP, apathy levels decreased significantly during 
the first year of treatment, followed by long-term stability. High individual 
levels of apathy at baseline were associated with higher apathy levels during 
the follow-up. Long DUP and high baseline levels of depression predicted higher 
apathy levels at follow-ups. The effect of DUP was persistent, while the effect 
of baseline depression decreased over time. At 10 years, apathy was 
statistically significantly associated with reduced functioning. The early phase 
of the disorder may be critical to the development of apathy in FEP.
