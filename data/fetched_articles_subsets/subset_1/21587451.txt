In the title complex, [Cu(C(17)H(13)N(2)O)(2)], the Cu(II) atom is 
tetra-coordinated by two N atoms and two O atoms from two bidentate 
1-[(E)-o-tolyl-diazen-yl]-2-naphtho-late ligands, forming a slightly distorted 
square-planar environment. The two N atoms and two O atoms around the Cu(II) 
atom are trans to each other, with an O-Cu-O bond angle of 177.00 (9)° and an 
N-Cu-N bond angle of 165.63 (10)°. The average distances between the Cu(II) atom 
and the coordinated O and N atoms are 1.905 (2) and 1.995 (2)Å, respectively.
