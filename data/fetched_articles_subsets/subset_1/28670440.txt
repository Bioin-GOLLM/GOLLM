Transcriptomic phenotypes defined for melanoma have been reported to correlate 
with sensitivity to various drugs. In this study, we aimed to define a minimal 
signature that could be used to distinguish melanoma sub-types in vitro, and to 
determine suitable drugs by which these sub-types can be targeted. By using 
primary melanoma cell lines, as well as commercially available melanoma cell 
lines, we find that the evaluation of MLANA and INHBA expression is as capable 
as one based on a combined analysis performed with genes for stemness, EMT and 
invasion/proliferation, in identifying melanoma subtypes that differ in their 
sensitivity to molecularly targeted drugs. Using this approach, we find that 75% 
of melanoma cell lines can be treated with either the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 or 
the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG.
