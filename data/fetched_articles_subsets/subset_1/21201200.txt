The title compound, C(11)H(10)O(2), crystallizes with two independent mol-ecules 
in the asymmetric unit. In one mol-ecule, the dihedral angle between the mean 
planes of the C-C=C-C group of the diene unit and essentially planar 
cyclo-hexene ring is 51.07 (9)°, while in the other mol-ecule it is 54.49 (12)°. 
In the crystal structure, weak inter-molecular C-H⋯O inter-actions link the 
mol-ecules into columns along the b axis.
