BACKGROUND: Reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) have been associated with 
improved cardiovascular outcomes and savings in medical expenditures. One public 
health approach has involved pharmacists within primary care settings. The 
objective was to assess change in HbA1C from baseline after 3-5 months of follow 
up in pharmacist-managed cardiovascular risk reduction (CVRR) clinics.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort chart review occurred in eight 
pharmacist-managed CVRR federally qualified health clinics (FQHC) in Indiana, 
United States. Data were collected from patients seen by a CVRR pharmacist 
within the timeframe of January 1, 2015 through February 28, 2020. Data 
collected include: demographic characteristics and clinical markers between 
baseline and follow-up. HbA1C from baseline after 3 to 5 months was assessed 
with pared t-tests analysis. Other clinical variables were assessed and 
additional analysis were performed at 6-8 months. Additional results are 
reported between 9 months and 36 months of follow up.
RESULTS: The primary outcome evaluation included 445 patients. Over 36 months of 
evaluation, 3,803 encounters were described. Compared to baseline, HbA1C was 
reduced by 1.6% (95%CI -1.8, -1.4, p<0.01) after 3-5 months of CVRR care. 
Reductions in HbA1C persisted at 6-8 months with a reduction of 1.8% ([95%CI 
-2.0, -1.5] p<0.01). The follow-up losses were 29.5% at 3-5 months and 93.2% at 
33-36 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study augments the existing literature by demonstrating the 
health improvement of pharmacist-managed CVRR clinics. The great proportion of 
loss to follow-up is a limitation of this study to be considered. Additional 
studies exploring the expansion of similar models may amplify the public health 
impact of pharmacist-managed CVRR services in primary care sites.
