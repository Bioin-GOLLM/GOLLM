Friction continues to account for the bulk of energy losses in mechanical 
systems, with an estimated 23% of the world's total energy consumption used to 
overcome friction. Concentrated polymer brushes (CPBs) have recently attracted 
significant scientific and industrial attention, given their ability to achieve 
superlubricity (i.e., coefficients of friction below 0.01); however, 
understanding the mechanistic interactions underlying their wear performance has 
been largely overlooked. Herein, we employ a custom-built optical test apparatus 
to investigate the inter-dependencies between CPBs and laser-produced surface 
texture (LST), assessing for the first time the friction, film thickness, and 
wear behavior in situ and simultaneously. Recent developments in picosecond 
laser etching allowed us to graft CPBs atop the finest laser-etched matrix of 
micron-sized dimples reported in literature to date. At low sliding speeds, 
combined CPB-LST reduces the coefficient of friction to 0.0006, while increasing 
the CPB durability by up to 34% through a lateral support mechanism offered by 
the textured micro-features. Furthermore, the imaging results shed light on CPB 
failure mechanisms. Both these mechanisms of lateral support and failure 
propagation impact the wear resistance of CPBs and are important in the 
development of CPBs for future applications (e.g., in low-speed bearings 
functioning under controlled abrasive wear conditions).
