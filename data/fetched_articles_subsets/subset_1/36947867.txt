The ancient protein TSPO (translocator protein 18kD) is found in all kingdoms 
and was originally identified as a binding site of benzodiazepine drugs. Its 
physiological function remains unclear, although porphyrins are conserved 
ligands. Several crystal structures of bacterial TSPO and nuclear magnetic 
resonance structures of a mouse form have revealed monomer and dimer 
configurations, but there have been no reports of structures with a 
physiological ligand. Here, we present the first X-ray structures of Rhodobacter 
sphaeroides TSPO with a physiological ligand bound. Two different variants 
(substituting threonine for alanine at position 139 (A139T) and phenylalanine 
for alanine at position 138 (A138F)) yielded well-diffracting crystals giving 
structures of both apo- and heme-containing forms. Both variants have wild-type 
micromolar affinity for heme and protoporphyrin IX, but A139T has very low 
ability to accelerate the breakdown of porphyrin in the presence of light and 
oxygen. The binding of heme to one protomer of the dimer of either mutant 
induces a more rigid structure, both in the heme-binding protomer and the 
protomer without heme bound, demonstrating an allosteric response. Ensemble 
refinement of the X-ray data reveals distinct regions of altered flexibility in 
response to single heme binding to the dimer. The A139T variant shows a more 
rigid structure overall, which may relate to extra hydrogen bonding of waters 
captured in the heme crevice. As TSPO has been suggested to have a role in heme 
delivery from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, the new structures provide 
potential clues regarding the structural basis of such activity.
