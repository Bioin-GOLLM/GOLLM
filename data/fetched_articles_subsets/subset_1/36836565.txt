Unlike arterial disease, chronic venous disease (CVD) is rarely life-threatening 
or limb-threatening. However, it can impose substantial morbidity on patients by 
influencing their lifestyle and quality of life (QoL). The aim of this 
nonsystematic narrative review is to provide an overview of the most recent 
information on the management of CVD and specifically, iliofemoral venous 
stenting in the context of personalized considerations for specific patient 
populations. The philosophy of treating CVD and phases of endovenous iliac 
stenting are also described in this review. Additionally, the use of 
intravascular ultrasound is described as the preferred operative diagnostic 
procedural tool for iliofemoral venous stent placement.
