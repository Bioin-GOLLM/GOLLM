Gestational diabetes mellitus is a progressive and complex pregnancy 
complication, which threatens both maternal and fetal health. It is urgent to 
screen for specific biomarkers for early diagnosis and precise treatment, as 
well as to identify key moleculars to better understand the pathogenic 
mechanisms. In the present review, we comprehensively summarized recent studies 
of gestational diabetes using mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies. 
Focused on the entire experimental design and proteomic results, we showed that 
these studies have covered a broad range of research contents in terms of 
sampling time, sample types, and outcome associations. Although most of the 
studies only stayed in the stage of initial discovery, several proteins were 
further verified to be efficient for disease diagnosis. Functional analysis of 
all the combined significant proteins also showed that a small number of 
proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of insulin or indirect 
signaling pathways. However, many factors such as diagnostic criteria, sample 
processing, proteomic method, and statistical method can greatly affect the 
identification of reproducible and reliable protein candidates. Thus, we further 
provided constructive suggestions and recommendations for carrying out proteomic 
or follow-up studies of gestational diabetes or other pregnancy complications in 
the future.
