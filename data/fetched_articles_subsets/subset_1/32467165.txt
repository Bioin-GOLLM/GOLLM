The existence of multiple serotypes renders vaccine development challenging for 
most viruses in the Enterovirus genus. An alternative and potentially more 
viable strategy for control of these viruses is to develop broad-spectrum 
antivirals by targeting highly conserved proteins that are indispensable for the 
virus life cycle, such as the 3C protease. Previously, two single-chain antibody 
fragments, YDF and GGVV, were reported to effectively inhibit human rhinovirus 
14 proliferation. Here, we found that both single-chain antibody fragments 
target sites on the 3C protease that are distinct from its known drug site 
(peptidase active site) and possess different mechanisms of inhibition. YDF does 
not block the active site but instead noncompetitively inhibits 3C peptidase 
activity through an allosteric effect that is rarely seen for antibody protease 
inhibitors. Meanwhile, GGVV antagonizes the less-explored regulatory function of 
3C in genome replication. The interaction between 3C and the viral genome 5' 
noncoding region has been reported to be important for enterovirus genome 
replication. Here, the interface between human rhinovirus 14 3C and its 5' 
noncoding region was probed by hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled mass 
spectrometry and found to partially overlap with the interface between GGVV and 
3C. Consistently, prebinding of GGVV completely abolishes interaction between 
human rhinovirus 14 3C and its 5' noncoding region. The epitopes of YDF and 
GGVV, therefore, represent two additional sites of therapeutic vulnerability in 
rhinovirus. Importantly, the GGVV epitope appears to be conserved across many 
enteroviruses, suggesting that it is a promising target for pan-enterovirus 
inhibitor screening and design.
