The arginine methylation status of histones dynamically changes during many 
cellular processes, including hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) 
development. The arginine methyltransferases and the readers that transduce 
the histone codes have been defined. However, whether arginine demethylation 
actively occurs in cells and what enzyme demethylates the methylarginine 
residues during various cellular processes are unknown. We report that JMJD1B, 
previously identified as a lysine demethylase for H3K9me2, mediates arginine 
demethylation of H4R3me2s and its intermediate, H4R3me1. We show that 
demethylation of H4R3me2s and H3K9me2s in promoter regions is correlated with 
active gene expression. Furthermore, knockout of JMJD1B blocks demethylation of 
H4R3me2s and/or H3K9me2 at distinct clusters of genes and impairs the activation 
of genes important for HSPC differentiation and development. Consequently, 
JMJD1B-/- mice show defects in hematopoiesis. Altogether, our study demonstrates 
that demethylase-mediated active arginine demethylation process exists in 
eukaryotes and that JMJD1B demethylates both H4R3me2s and H3K9me2 for epigenetic 
programming during hematopoiesis.
