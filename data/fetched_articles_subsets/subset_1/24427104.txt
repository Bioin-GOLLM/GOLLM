In the crystal structure of the title salt, C10H16N3O(+)·C7H5O2 (-), the cations 
and anions are linked to each other via N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming infinite 
chains running along [010]. The crystal structure also features C-H⋯O and π-π 
stacking inter-actions, which assemble the chains into supra-molecular layers 
parallel to (100). The π-π stacking inter-actions are observed between the 
pyridine rings of inversion-related cations with a centroid-centroid distance of 
3.867 (2) Å.
