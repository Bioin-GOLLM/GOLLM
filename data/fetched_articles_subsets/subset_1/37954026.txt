PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the effect of S-ketamine on slow wave sleep 
(SWS) and the related changes in serum protein in gynecological patients after 
open abdomen surgery.
METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial. One hundred gynecological 
patients undergoing open abdomen surgery were randomized into an S-ketamine 
group (group S) or placebo group (0.9% saline; group C). During operation, 
patients in group S received adjuvant S-ketamine infusion (0.2 mg·kg-1·h-1) 
while those in group C received 0.9% saline. All patients were connected to 
patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) pump in the end of the surgery 
and the patients in group S with an additional S-ketamine in PCIA pump. 
Polysomnogram (PSG) was monitored during the next night after surgery with PCIA 
pump. Blood samples were collected for proteomic analysis at 6:00 AM after PSG 
monitoring. The primary outcome was the percentage of SWS (also known as stage 3 
non-rapid eye movement sleep, stage N3) on the next night after surgery, and the 
secondary outcome was subjective sleep quality, pain scores, and the changes in 
serum proteomics.
RESULTS: Complete polysomnogram recordings were obtained from 64 study 
participants (31 in group C and 33 in group S). The administration of S-ketamine 
infusion resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of SWS/N3 compared 
to the control group (group C, median (IQR [range]), 8.9 (6.3, 12.5); group S, 
median (IQR [range]), 15.6 (12.4, 18.8), P<0.001). However, subjective 
evaluations of sleep quality revealed no significant variances between the two 
groups. The protein affected by S-ketamine was primarily associated with 
posttranslational modification, protein turnover, carbohydrate transport, and 
metabolism.
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing open gynecological surgery, S-ketamine 
enhanced the percentage of objective sleep of SWS during the next night after 
surgery. Additionally, there were differences observed in serum protein levels 
between the two groups.
