The evolutionary forces shaping life history divergence within species are 
largely unknown. Turquoise killifish display differences in lifespan among wild 
populations, representing an ideal natural experiment in evolution and 
diversification of life history. By combining genome sequencing and population 
genetics, we investigate the evolutionary forces shaping lifespan among wild 
turquoise killifish populations. We generate an improved reference genome 
assembly and identify genes under positive and purifying selection, as well as 
those evolving neutrally. Short-lived populations from the outer margin of the 
species range have small population size and accumulate deleterious mutations in 
genes significantly enriched in the WNT signaling pathway, neurodegeneration, 
cancer and the mTOR pathway. We propose that limited population size due to 
habitat fragmentation and repeated population bottlenecks, by increasing the 
genome-wide mutation load, exacerbates the effects of mutation accumulation and 
cumulatively contribute to the short adult lifespan.
