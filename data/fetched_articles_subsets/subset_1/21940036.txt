Epithelial to mesenchymal transition is thought to be implicated in tumor 
invasion and metastasis. To investigate its role in myometrial invasion, samples 
from 42 stage I (confined to the corpus) endometrioid endometrial carcinomas 
were analyzed. All E-cadherin repressors (SNAI1, SNAI2 (SLUG), ZEB1, HMGA2, and 
TWIST1) had a higher expression in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas than in 
normal endometrium (P < .0001), whereas CDH1 (E-cadherin gene) tended to be 
lower. In comparison with nonmyoinvasive (stage IA) tumors, those with deep 
myometrial invasion (stage IC) had increased messenger RNA expression of SLUG, 
ZEB1, and HMGA2 (P < .001). Furthermore, samples from the myoinvasive front of 
deeply invasive tumors had higher levels of SLUG, ZEB1, and HMGA2 than the 
corresponding superficial samples. Immunohistochemical analysis of these cases 
revealed that the decrease in E-cadherin was concordant with an increase in 
Snail and Twist protein expression. Trying to induce epithelial to mesenchymal 
transition in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas, we initially produced 
persistent activation of this pathway in Ishikawa cells. The cell line was 
infected with lentiviruses carrying the V600E mutation of BRAF, inducing loss of 
β-catenin, E-cadherin, and cytokeratin and increase in vimentin and Snail. These 
changes were mediated by ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was also increased at the 
myoinvasive front. Furthermore, MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 reversed the mesenchymal 
phenotype. Our findings suggest that epithelial to mesenchymal transition 
regulators are implicated in myometrial invasion of endometrioid endometrial 
carcinoma and may be potential therapeutic targets through the MAPK/ERK pathway.
