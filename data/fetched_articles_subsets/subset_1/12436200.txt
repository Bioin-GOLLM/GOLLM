Intracellular concentrations of the nucleotide inosine triphosphate (ITP) are 
regulated by ITP-ase (EC 3.6.1.19), which is encoded by ITPA on chromosome 20p. 
Subjects with complete deficiency of ITP-ase activity (MIM 147520) have elevated 
ITP concentrations in erythrocytes, but no obvious clinical abnormalities. Based 
on biochemical screening, complete ITP-ase deficiency has been postulated to 
result from homozygosity for a dysfunctional allele, with an estimated frequency 
of 0.05 in Caucasians. ITP-ase deficiency has not yet been characterized at the 
molecular genetic level. Sequencing of the genomic DNA from a Caucasian subject 
with complete ITP-ase deficiency revealed homozygosity for missense mutation 
198C>A, which predicted a threonine for proline substitution at codon 32 (P32T), 
whereas among 125 normal Caucasians, there were no homozygotes for P32T (P = 
0.0079). The P32T allele frequency of 0.07 in Caucasians was similar to the 
estimates derived from earlier biochemical studies. P32T was found to be present 
at varying frequency in other ethnic groups. Two common synonymous 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms were also identified. These ITPAmarkers, 
including P32T, provide tools for further study of association with clinical and 
biochemical phenotypes.
