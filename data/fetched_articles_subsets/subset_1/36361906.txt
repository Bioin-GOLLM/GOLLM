Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and widespread condition, still not fully 
understood and with no cure yet. Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide is suspected to be a 
major cause of AD, and therefore, simultaneously blocking its formation and 
aggregation by inhibition of the enzymes BACE-1 (β-secretase) and AChE 
(acetylcholinesterase) by a single inhibitor may be an effective therapeutic 
approach, as compared to blocking one of these targets or by combining two 
drugs, one for each of these targets. We used our ISE algorithm to model each of 
the AChE peripheral site inhibitors and BACE-1 inhibitors, on the basis of 
published data, and constructed classification models for each. Subsequently, we 
screened large molecular databases with both models. Top scored molecules were 
docked into AChE and BACE-1 crystal structures, and 36 Molecules with the best 
weighted scores (based on ISE indexes and docking results) were sent for 
inhibition studies on the two enzymes. Two of them inhibited both AChE (IC50 
between 4-7 μM) and BACE-1 (IC50 between 50-65 μM). Two additional molecules 
inhibited only AChE, and another two molecules inhibited only BACE-1. 
Preliminary testing of inhibition by F681-0222 (molecule 2) on APPswe/PS1dE9 
transgenic mice shows a reduction in brain tissue of soluble Aβ42.
