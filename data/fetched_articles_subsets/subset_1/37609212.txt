In many species, early embryonic mitoses proceed at a very rapid pace, but how 
this pace is achieved is not understood. Here we show that in the early C. 
elegans embryo, cyclin B3 is the dominant driver of rapid embryonic mitoses. 
Metazoans typically have three cyclin B isoforms that associate with and 
activate Cdk1 kinase to orchestrate mitotic events: the related cyclins B1 and 
B2 and the more divergent cyclin B3. We show that whereas embryos expressing 
cyclins B1 and B2 support slow mitosis (NEBD to Anaphase ~ 600s), the presence 
of cyclin B3 dominantly drives the ~3-fold faster mitosis observed in wildtype 
embryos. CYB-1/2-driven mitosis is longer than CYB-3-driven mitosis primarily 
because the progression of mitotic events itself is slower, rather than delayed 
anaphase onset due to activation of the spindle checkpoint or inhibitory 
phosphorylation of the anaphase activator CDC-20. Addition of cyclin B1 to 
cyclin B3-only mitosis introduces an ~60s delay between the completion of 
chromosome alignment and anaphase onset, which likely ensures segregation 
fidelity; this delay is mediated by inhibitory phosphorylation on CDC-20. Thus, 
the dominance of cyclin B3 in driving mitotic events, coupled to introduction of 
a short cyclin B1-dependent delay in anaphase onset, sets the rapid pace and 
ensures fidelity of mitoses in the early C. elegans embryo.
