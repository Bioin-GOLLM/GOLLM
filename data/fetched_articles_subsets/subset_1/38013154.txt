OBJECTIVE: Although individual steps have been characterized, there is little 
understanding of the overall process whereby glucose co-ordinates the 
biosynthesis of insulin with its export out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
and incorporation into insulin secretory granules (ISGs). Here we investigate a 
role for the transcription factor CREB3L2 in this context.
METHODS: MIN6 cells and mouse islets were analysed by immunoblotting after 
treatment with glucose, fatty acids, thapsigargin and various inhibitors. 
Knockdown of CREB3L2 was achieved using si or sh constructs by transfection, or 
viral delivery. In vivo metabolic phenotyping was conducted after deletion of 
CREB3L2 in β-cells of adult mice using Ins1-CreER+. Islets were isolated for 
RNAseq and assays of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Trafficking 
was monitored in islet monolayers using a GFP-tagged proinsulin construct that 
allows for synchronised release from the ER.
RESULTS: With a Km ≈3.5 mM, glucose rapidly (T1/2 0.9 h) increased full length 
(FL) CREB3L2 followed by a slower rise (T1/2 2.5 h) in its 
transcriptionally-active cleavage product, P60 CREB3L2. Glucose stimulation 
repressed the ER stress marker, CHOP, and this was partially reverted by 
knockdown of CREB3L2. Activation of CREB3L2 by glucose was not due to ER stress, 
however, but a combination of O-GlcNAcylation, which impaired proteasomal 
degradation of FL-CREB3L2, and mTORC1 stimulation, which enhanced its conversion 
to P60. cAMP generation also activated CREB3L2, but independently of glucose. 
Deletion of CREB3L2 inhibited GSIS ex vivo and, following a high-fat diet (HFD), 
impaired glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in vivo. RNAseq revealed that 
CREB3L2 regulated genes controlling trafficking to-and-from the Golgi, as well 
as a broader cohort associated with β-cell compensation during a HFD. Although 
post-Golgi trafficking appeared intact, knockdown of CREB3L2 impaired the 
generation of both nascent ISGs and proinsulin condensates in the Golgi, 
implying a defect in ER export of proinsulin and/or its processing in the Golgi.
CONCLUSION: The stimulation of CREB3L2 by glucose defines a novel, rapid and 
direct mechanism for co-ordinating the synthesis, packaging and storage of 
insulin, thereby minimizing ER overload and optimizing β-cell function under 
conditions of high secretory demand. Upregulation of CREB3L2 also potentially 
contributes to the benefits of GLP1 agonism and might in itself constitute a 
novel means of treating β-cell failure.
