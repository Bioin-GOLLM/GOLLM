The "Warburg effect" describes the reprogramming of glucose metabolism away from 
oxidative phosphorylation toward aerobic glycolysis, and it is one of the 
hallmarks of cancer cells. Several factors can be involved in this process, but 
in this review, the roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are highlighted in several 
types of human cancer. ncRNAs, including microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and 
circular RNAs, can all affect metabolic enzymes and transcription factors to 
promote glycolysis and modulate glucose metabolism to enhance the progression of 
tumors. In particular, the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
pathways are associated with alterations in ncRNAs. A better understanding of 
the roles of ncRNAs in the Warburg effect could ultimately lead to new 
therapeutic approaches for suppressing cancer.
