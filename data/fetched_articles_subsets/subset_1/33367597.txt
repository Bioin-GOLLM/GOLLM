Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, harboring 
the largest viral RNA genomes known to date. Apart from the primary sequence 
encoding for all the viral proteins needed for the generation of new viral 
particles, certain regions of CoV genomes are known to fold into stable 
structures, controlling several aspects of CoV life cycle, from the regulation 
of the discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs, to the packaging of the 
genome into new virions. Here we review the current knowledge on CoV RNA 
structures, discussing it in light of the most recent discoveries made possible 
by analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
