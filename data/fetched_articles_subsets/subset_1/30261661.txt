Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by ectopic lipid 
accumulation in the liver, usually combined with hepatic insulin resistance. 
Fc-gamma receptor-IIb (FcγRIIb) and its ligand are reported to be associated 
with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). As knowledge about FcγRIIb in 
the literature is mostly generated from studies on skeletal muscle tissue, the 
expression and function of FcγRIIb in the liver and hepatocytes are largely 
unknown. In this study, we identified the expression of FcγRIIb in primary 
cultured mouse hepatocytes: FcγRIIb was upregulated in response to oleic acid 
(OA) in a dose dependent manner. FcγRIIb knockdown using shRNA suppressed the 
lipid and triglyceride accumulation, and mRNA expression of ACC1, FASn, CD36, 
MTTP, and ApoB in OA-treated HepG2 cells. FcγRIIb deficiency mice fed with high 
fat diet (HFD) had significantly lower liver weight and liver to body weight 
ratio, as well as less triglyceride accumulation in the livers. In 
glycometabolism, FcγRIIb hindered insulin-induced phosphorylation of AKT and 
FOXO1, and in turn upregulated G6Pase and PEPCK mRNA expression, suggesting that 
FcγRIIb promotes gluconeogenesis by suppressing the AKT/FOXO1/G6Pase/PEPCK 
pathway in hepatocytes. This study reveals a novel role for FcγRIIb in 
regulating lipid metabolism and glycometabolism, and provides a new therapeutic 
target to improve NAFLD.
