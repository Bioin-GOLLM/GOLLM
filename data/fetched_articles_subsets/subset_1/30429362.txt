Mono-ADP-ribosylation of an (arginine) protein catalyzed by 
ADP-ribosyltransferase 1 (ART1) - i.e., transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to 
arginine - is reversed by ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolase 1 (ARH1) cleavage of the 
ADP-ribose-arginine bond. ARH1-deficient mice developed cardiomyopathy with 
myocardial fibrosis, decreased myocardial function under dobutamine stress, and 
increased susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion injury. The membrane repair 
protein TRIM72 was identified as a substrate for ART1 and ARH1; ADP-ribosylated 
TRIM72 levels were greater in ARH1-deficient mice following ischemia/reperfusion 
injury. To understand better the role of TRIM72 and ADP-ribosylation, we used 
C2C12 myocytes. ARH1 knockdown in C2C12 myocytes increased ADP-ribosylation of 
TRIM72 and delayed wound healing in a scratch assay. Mutant TRIM72 (R207K, 
R260K) that is not ADP-ribosylated interfered with assembly of TRIM72 repair 
complexes at a site of laser-induced injury. The regulatory enzymes ART1 and 
ARH1 and their substrate TRIM72 were found in multiple complexes, which were 
coimmunoprecipitated from mouse heart lysates. In addition, the 
mono-ADP-ribosylation inhibitors vitamin K1 and novobiocin inhibited 
oligomerization of TRIM72, the mechanism by which TRIM72 is recruited to the 
site of injury. We propose that a mono-ADP-ribosylation cycle involving 
recruitment of TRIM72 and other regulatory factors to sites of membrane damage 
is critical for membrane repair and wound healing following myocardial injury.
