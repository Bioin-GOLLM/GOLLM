Until now, in Greece, the resistance of enterococci to linezolid was associated 
with mutations of domain V of 23S ribosomal RNA (G2576T). Here we report the 
first linezolid-resistant optrA-positive Enterococcus faecalis sequence type 
(ST) 16 isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection (UTI). No travels 
overseas, contact with food-producing animals or previous treatment with 
linezolid were reported. Plasmid analysis suggested the chromosomal location of 
optrA gene. Additionally, whole genome sequencing data revealed the association 
of optrA with transposon Tn554 and the coexistence with fexA, spc and ermA-like 
resistance genes. A similar genetic structure has been previously identified in 
an ST767 E.Â faecalis from Taiwan.
