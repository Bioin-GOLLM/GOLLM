We reported that tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) secreted from vascular 
endothelial cells (VECs) is retained on the cell surface and effectively evokes 
both plasminogen activation and fibrin clot dissolution (fibrinolysis) on VECs. 
Here, to evaluate possibly different behaviors of variants of tPA, we 
quantitatively assessed these two events separately using green fluorescent 
protein (GFP)-conjugated tPA in cultured human VECs. The amount of secreted 
wild-type tPA-GFP correlated well with both the activities of plasminogen 
activation (r = 0.66) and fibrinolysis (r = -0.93). A variant of tPA-GFP, with a 
lower affinity to the surface of VECs but higher affinity to fibrin, showed 
higher fibrinolysis and lower plasminogen activation activity compared to the 
wild-type.
