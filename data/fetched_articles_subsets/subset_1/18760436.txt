The orthopoxvirus SPI-3 (K2) and A56 (hemagglutinin, HA) proteins interact and 
together prevent cell-cell fusion. SPI-3/A56 has been proposed to prevent the 
superinfection of previously infected cells by reducing virus-cell fusion. 
Binding of mature virions of vaccinia virus (VV) to VV-infected cells was 
unaffected by SPI-3 or A56 on the surface of infected cells. Entry of VV into 
infected cells was assessed using VV-P(T7)-luc carrying the luciferase reporter 
under T7 control. Cells infected with VV or cowpox virus (CPV) expressing T7 RNA 
polymerase and lacking SPI-3 and/or A56 were superinfected with VV-P(T7)-luc, 
and luciferase activity was measured. Inactivation of SPI-3 or A56 from the 
pre-infecting virus resulted in greater luciferase expression from the 
superinfecting VV-P(T7)-luc. Antibody against SPI-3 present during infection 
with wild-type CPV-T7 increased luciferase expression from superinfecting 
VV-P(T7)-luc. The SPI-3/A56 complex on the infected cell surface therefore 
appears to reduce the entry of virions into infected cells.
