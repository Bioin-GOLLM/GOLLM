INTRODUCTION: Comprehensive genetic testing for dystrophinopathy can detect ∼95% 
of pathogenic variants in the dystrophin gene (DMD) and is often the preferred 
diagnostic approach.
METHODS: We reviewed pathology reports for muscle biopsies evaluated at the 
University of Iowa with a pathological diagnosis of dystrophinopathy based on 
dystrophic histopathology and abnormal immunofluorescence staining: reduced to 
absent dystrophin, expression of utrophin, and loss of neuronal nitric oxide 
synthase.
RESULTS: The percentage of muscle biopsies with dystrophinopathy has been stable 
since 1997. Among 2,298 biopsies evaluated between 2011 and 2016, 72 (3.1%) had 
pathologic features of dystrophinopathy. Median age at biopsy was 8 years 
(range, 0.66-84). Half had undergone DMD genetic testing prior to biopsy. 
Clinical phenotypes recorded on requisitions were typical of muscular dystrophy 
for 57 (79%) biopsies.
DISCUSSION: Muscle biopsy continues to play an important role in the diagnosis 
of dystrophinopathy, particularly in patients with later symptom onset, 
comorbidities, or normal DMD genetic testing results. Muscle Nerve, 2018.
