Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the central 
nervous system, traditionally considered to be an autoimmune, demyelinating 
disease. Based on this understanding, the initial therapeutic strategies were 
directed at immune modulation and inflammation control. At present, there are 
five licensed first-line disease-modifying drugs and two second-line treatments 
in MS. Currently available MS therapies have shown significant efficacy 
throughout many trials, but they produce different side-effect profiles in 
patients. Since they are well known and safe, they require regular and frequent 
parenteral administration and are associated with limited long-term treatment 
adherence. Thus, there is an important need for the development of new 
therapeutic strategies. Several oral compounds are in late-stage development for 
treating MS. Fingolimod (FTY720; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is an oral 
sphingosine-1-phosphase receptor modulator which has demonstrated superior 
efficacy compared with placebo and interferon Î²-1a in Phase III studies and has 
been approved in the treatment of MS. We summarily review the oral compounds in 
study, focusing on the recent development, approval and the clinical experience 
with FTY720.
