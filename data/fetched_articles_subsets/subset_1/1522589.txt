The crystal structure of a chimeric Fab' fragment of a monoclonal antibody is 
presented. The Fab' comprises the murine light chain and heavy chain variable 
domains of the carcinoma-binding antibody B72.3 fused to the constant domain of 
human kappa, and the first constant domain and hinge domain of human gamma 4, 
respectively. A model for the Fab' has been determined by molecular replacement 
and refined to a resolution of 3.1 A with an R-factor of 17.6%. The additional 
residues that distinguish a Fab' from a Fab fragment are seen to be disordered 
in the crystals. The H3 hypervariable loop is short and adopts a sharp hairpin 
turn in a conformation that results from an interaction between the lysine 
side-chain of H93 and the main-chain carbonyl group of H96. The remaining 
hypervariable loops display conformations similar to those predicted from the 
canonical structures approach, although loop H2 is apparently displaced by a 
salt-bridge formed between H55 Asp and the neighbouring H73 Lys. These and other 
features of the structure likely to be important in grafting the hypervariable 
loops to an otherwise human framework are discussed.
