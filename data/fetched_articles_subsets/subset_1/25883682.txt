BACKGROUND: Lignocellulolytic fungal cells suffer endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress during lignocellulase synthesis; however, an understanding of this 
integrated process on a genome-wide scale remains poor. Here, we undertook a 
systematic investigation of this process in Neurospora crassa (N. crassa) using 
transcriptomic analysis coupled with genetic screens.
RESULTS: A set of 766 genes was identified as the ER stress response targets 
(ESRTs) in N. crassa under cellulose utilization conditions. Among these, the 
expression of 223 and 186 genes showed dependence on IRE-1 and HAC-1, 
respectively. A total of 527 available mutants for ESRT genes were screened, 249 
of which exhibited ER stress susceptibility, including 100 genes with unknown 
function. Disruption of ire-1 or hac-1 in N. crassa did not affect 
transcriptional induction of lignocellulase genes by cellulose but severely 
affected secretion of the corresponding enzymes. A global investigation of 
transcription factors (TFs) discovered three novel regulators (RES-1, RES-2, 
RRG-2) involved in lignocellulase secretion. Production of lignocellulases in 
Δres-1 increased by more than 30% in comparison to wild type (WT), while 
secretion decreased by nearly 30% in strains Δres-2 and Δrrg-2. Transcriptional 
profiling of the three TF mutants suggests they are deeply involved in 
lignocellulase secretion and ER stress response.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we determined the transcriptional scope of the ER stress 
response during lignocellulase synthesis in the model cellulolytic fungus N. 
crassa. Through genome-wide mutant screening and analysis, dozens of novel genes 
were discovered to be involved in the process. The findings of this work will be 
useful for strain improvement to facilitate lignocellulase and biomass-based 
chemical production.
