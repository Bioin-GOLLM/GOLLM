BACKGROUND: Hereditary colon cancer is characterized by the inheritance of an 
abnormal gene mutation which predisposes to malignancy. Recent advances in 
genomic medicine have identified mutations in "novel" genes as conferring an 
increased risk of colorectal cancer. Mutations in the BRIP1 gene (BRCA1 
Interacting Protein C- terminal helicase 1) are known to increase the risk of 
ovarian and breast cancers, but this genes association with colon cancer has not 
been previously reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe two patients with colon cancer whose tumor tissue 
were found to harbor BRIP1 mutations on analysis by next-generation sequencing. 
These patients were confirmed by analysis of lymphocytes to carry the mutation 
in the germline as well.
CONCLUSIONS: These case reports highlight a previously unreported association of 
BRIP1 germline mutations with colon cancer predisposition.
