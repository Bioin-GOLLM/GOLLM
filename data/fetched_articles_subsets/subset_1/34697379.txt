Recessive variants of the SLC26A4 gene are an important cause of hereditary 
hearing impairment. Several transgenic mice with different Slc26a4 variants have 
been generated. However, none have recapitulated the auditory phenotypes in 
humans. Of the SLC26A4 variants identified thus far, the p.T721M variant is of 
interest, as it appears to confer a more severe pathogenicity than most of the 
other missense variants, but milder pathogenicity than non-sense and frameshift 
variants. Using a genotype-driven approach, we established a knock-in mouse 
model homozygous for p.T721M. To verify the pathogenicity of p.T721M, we 
generated mice with compound heterozygous variants by intercrossing 
Slc26a4+/T721M mice with Slc26a4919-2A>G/919-2A>G mice, which segregated the 
c.919-2A > G variant with abolished Slc26a4 function. We then performed serial 
audiological assessments, vestibular evaluations, and inner ear morphological 
studies. Surprisingly, both Slc26a4T721M/T721M and Slc26a4919-2A>G/T721M showed 
normal audiovestibular functions and inner ear morphology, indicating that 
p.T721M is non-pathogenic in mice and a single p.T721M allele is sufficient to 
maintain normal inner ear physiology. The evidence together with previous 
reports on mouse models with Slc26a4 p.C565Y and p.H723R variants, support our 
speculation that the absence of audiovestibular phenotypes in these mouse models 
could be attributed to different protein structures at the C-terminus of human 
and mouse pendrin.
