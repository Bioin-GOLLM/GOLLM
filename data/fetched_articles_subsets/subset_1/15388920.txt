Disufide-bond isomerase (DsbC) plays a crucial role in folding periplasmically 
excreted bacterial proteins. The crystal structure of the reduced form of DsbC 
is presented. The pair of thiol groups from Cys98 and Cys101 that form the 
reversible disulfide bond in the enzymatic active site are 3.1 A apart and the 
electron density clearly shows that the S atoms do not form a covalent bond. The 
other pair of Cys residues (141 and 163) in DsbC form a disulfide bond. This is 
different from the previously reported crystal form of DsbC (McCarthy et al., 
2000), in which both Cys pairs are oxidized. Specific hydrogen-bond interactions 
are identified that stabilize the active site in the reactive reduced state with 
the special participation of hydrogen bonds between the active-site cysteine 
residues (98 and 101) and threonine residues 94 and 182. The present structure 
also differs in the orientation of the catalytic domains within the protein 
dimer. This is evidence of flexibility within the protein that probably plays a 
role in accommodating the substrates in the cleft between the catalytic domains.
