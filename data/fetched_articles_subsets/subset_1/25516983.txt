Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are at significant, cumulative 
risk of leukemic transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is 
associated with adverse clinical outcome and resistance to standard AML 
therapies. We performed genomic profiling of post-MPN AML samples; these studies 
demonstrate somatic tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutations are common in 
JAK2V617F-mutant, post-MPN AML but not in chronic-phase MPN and lead to clonal 
dominance of JAK2V617F/TP53-mutant leukemic cells. Consistent with these data, 
expression of JAK2V617F combined with Tp53 loss led to fully penetrant AML in 
vivo. JAK2V617F-mutant, Tp53-deficient AML was characterized by an expanded 
megakaryocyte erythroid progenitor population that was able to propagate the 
disease in secondary recipients. In vitro studies revealed that post-MPN AML 
cells were sensitive to decitabine, the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, or the 
heat shock protein 90 inhibitor 
8-(6-iodobenzo[d][1.3]dioxol-5-ylthio)-9-(3-(isopropylamino)propyl)-9H-purine-6-amine 
(PU-H71). Treatment with ruxolitinib or PU-H71 improved survival of mice 
engrafted with JAK2V617F-mutant, Tp53-deficient AML, demonstrating therapeutic 
efficacy for these targeted therapies and providing a rationale for testing 
these therapies in post-MPN AML.
