Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV mimicking non-accidental injury in a child.

Roberts DL, Pope FM, Nicholls AC, Narcisi P.

This case report describes a child in whom non-accidental injury was initially 
suspected, but who was later shown to have autosomal dominant Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome (EDS) type IV. Her mother and brother were also type III collagen 
deficient. This syndrome may be commoner than the small number of reported cases 
suggested and may sometimes explain previously undiagnosed easy bruising. The 
importance of recognizing this syndrome is stressed as it may save a great deal 
of embarrassment, frustration and anger for the family wrongly suspected of 
causing injury to their child.
