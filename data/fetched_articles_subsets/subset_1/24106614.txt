Objective. Recent studies on the association between uridine 
diphosphosglucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 2B17 polymorphism and risk of prostate 
cancer (PCa) showed inconclusive results. To clarify this possible association, 
we conducted a meta-analysis of published studies. Methods. We searched the 
published literature from PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and China National 
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). According to our inclusion criteria, studies 
that observed the association between UGT2B17 polymorphism and PCa risk were 
included. The principal outcome measure was the adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 
95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of PCa associated with UGT2B17 
polymorphism. Results. A total of 6 studies with 7,029 subjects (3,839 cases and 
3,190 controls) were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Overall, there 
was a significant association between UGT2B17 polymorphism and increased risk of 
prostate cancer (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.14-2.64, P < 0.001). Similar results were 
found in the subgroup analyses by ethnicity and types of controls. Conclusion. 
This meta-analysis demonstrates that UGT2B17 polymorphism is associated with 
prostate cancer susceptibility, and it contributes to the increased risk of 
prostate cancer.
