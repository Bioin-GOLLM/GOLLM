Sirolimus (SRL) and everolimus (EVR) are mammalian targets of rapamycin 
inhibitors (mTOR-I) largely employed in renal transplantation and oncology as 
immunosuppressive/antiproliferative agents. SRL was the first mTOR-I produced by 
the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus and approved for several medical 
purposes. EVR, derived from SRL, contains a 2-hydroxy-ethyl chain in the 40th 
position that makes the drug more hydrophilic than SRL and increases oral 
bioavailability. Their main mechanism of action is the inhibition of the mTOR 
complex 1 and the regulation of factors involved in a several crucial cellular 
functions including: protein synthesis, regulation of angiogenesis, lipid 
biosynthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis and function, cell cycle, and autophagy. 
Most of the proteins/enzymes belonging to the aforementioned biological 
processes are encoded by numerous and tightly regulated genes. However, at the 
moment, the polygenic influence on SRL/EVR cellular effects is still not 
completely defined, and its comprehension represents a key challenge for 
researchers. Therefore, to obtain a complete picture of the cellular network 
connected to SRL/EVR, we decided to review major evidences available in the 
literature regarding the genetic influence on mTOR-I biology/pharmacology and to 
build, for the first time, a useful and specific "SRL/EVR genes-focused 
pathway", possibly employable as a starting point for future in-depth research 
projects.
