A single base mutation in the gene for type III collagen (COL3A1) converts 
glycine 847 to glutamic acid in a family with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. An 
unaffected family member is mosaic for the mutation.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, an inherited connective tissue disease, is 
usually caused by mutations in the gene for type III collagen. Here, we describe 
a glycine to glutamic acid substitution in a patient with this syndrome. 
Previous studies had shown that fibroblasts from the patient, his mother and 
brother secreted a reduced amount of type III collagen and also produced an 
overmodified form of the protein that was preferentially retained 
intracellularly. Peptide mapping experiments indicated that the mutation was 
located within cyanogen bromide peptide 9. This was supported by chemical 
cleavage analysis and sequencing of cDNA encoding this region. Allele-specific 
oligonucleotide hybridisation of genomic DNA confirmed that a G to A mutation 
converted Gly 847 to Glu. The mutation was present in two other affected family 
members and also in a third, who was clinically unaffected. Further analysis of 
this unaffected individual revealed reduced mutant:normal ratios in DNA obtained 
from both blood and hair samples, showing that she was mosaic for the mutation.
