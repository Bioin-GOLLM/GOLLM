Sustained activation of the Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel is 
pivotal for effector T cell responses. The mechanisms underlying this 
sustainability remain poorly understood. We find that plasma membrane 
localization of ORAI1, the pore subunit of CRAC channels, is limited in effector 
T cells, with a significant fraction trapped in intracellular vesicles. From a 
targeted screen, we identify an essential component of ORAI1+ vesicles, naked 
cuticle homolog 2 (NKD2). Mechanistically, NKD2, an adaptor molecule activated 
by signaling pathways downstream of T cell receptors, orchestrates trafficking 
and insertion of ORAI1+ vesicles to the plasma membrane. Together, our findings 
suggest that T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulation-dependent insertion of ORAI1 into 
the plasma membrane is essential for sustained Ca2+ signaling and cytokine 
production in T cells.
