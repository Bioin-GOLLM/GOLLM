Aims: To investigate the interactions among narcolepsy-associated genes and 
reveal the pathways these genes involved through bioinformatics analyses. 
Methods: The study was performed with the following steps: 1) Selected the 
previously discovered narcolepsy risk genes through literature review, 2) 
pathway enrichment analysis, and construction of gene-gene and protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) networks for narcolepsy. Results: 1) GO analysis revealed the 
positive regulation of interferon-gamma production as the most enriched terms in 
biological process, and C-C chemokine receptor activity as the most enriched 
term in molecular function, 2) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed 
selective enrichment of genes in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction 
signaling pathways, and 3) five hub genes were identified (IFNAR1, IL10RB, 
DNMT1, TNFSF4 and NFATC2). Conclusion: The bioinformatics results provide new 
insights into the molecular pathogenesis of narcolepsy and the identification of 
potential therapeutic targets for narcolepsy treatment.
