These analyses of the COMBINE Study were designed to examine the effects of 
naltrexone among African Americans during the course of the 16-week treatment. 
Participants (total n=100; 70% male) who received naltrexone during the 16-week 
treatment trial (n=51) were compared to those who received placebo (n=49), 
controlling for acamprosate and behavioral intervention. Results did not support 
the efficacy of naltrexone on percent days abstinent, time to first heavy 
drinking day, and global clinical outcome in this subsample of African 
Americans. These results suggest that further work is needed to test naltrexone, 
as well as other medications, in this population and to identify treatment 
responders via genetics or other psychosocial predictor variables. Implications 
for pharmacogenetic studies of naltrexone are discussed.
