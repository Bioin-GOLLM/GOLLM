Chronic alterations in calcium (Ca2+) signalling in podocytes have been shown to 
cause proteinuria and progressive glomerular diseases. However, it is unclear 
whether short Ca2+ peaks influence glomerular biology and cause podocyte injury. 
Here we generated a DREADD (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by a 
Designer Drug) knock-in mouse line to manipulate intracellular Ca2+ levels. By 
mating to a podocyte-specific Cre driver we are able to investigate the impact 
of Ca2+ peaks on podocyte biology in living animals. Activation of the 
engineered G-protein coupled receptor with the synthetic compound 
clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) evoked a short and transient Ca2+ peak in podocytes 
immediately after CNO administration in vivo. Interestingly, this Ca2+ peak did 
neither affect glomerular perfusion nor filtration in the animals. Moreover, no 
obvious alterations in the glomerular morphology could be observed. Taken 
together, these in vivo findings suggest that chronic alterations and calcium 
overload rather than an induction of transient Ca2+ peaks contribute to podocyte 
disease.
