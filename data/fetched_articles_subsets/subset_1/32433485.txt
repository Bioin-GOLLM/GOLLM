Viral infections trigger host innate immune responses, characterized by the 
production of type-I interferons (IFN) including IFNβ. IFNβ induces cellular 
antiviral defense mechanisms and thereby contributes to pathogen clearance. 
Accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondria constitute a crucial platform 
for the induction of antiviral immunity. Here we demonstrate that the 
mitochondrial protein phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5 (PGAM5) is 
important for the antiviral cellular response. Following challenge of HeLa cells 
with the dsRNA-analog poly(I:C), PGAM5 oligomers and high levels of PGAM5 were 
found in mitochondrial aggregates. Using immunoprecipitation, a direct 
interaction of PGAM5 with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) 
was demonstrated. In addition, PGAM5 deficient cells showed diminished 
expression of IFNβ and IFNβ target genes as compared to WT cells. Moreover, 
PGAM5 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited decreased 
phosphorylation levels of IRF3 and TBK1 when challenged with poly(I:C) 
intracellularly. Finally, PGAM5 deficient MEFs, upon infection with vesicular 
stomatitis virus (VSV), revealed diminished IFNβ expression and increased VSV 
replication. Collectively, our study highlights PGAM5 as an important regulator 
for IFNβ production mediated via the TBK1/IRF3 signaling pathway in response to 
viral infection.
