BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common type of 
cancer and has a high mortality rate worldwide. Sorafenib is the only systemic 
treatment demonstrating a statistically significant but modest overall survival 
benefit. We previously have identified the aurora kinases (AURKs) and FMS-like 
tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) multikinase inhibitor DBPR114 exhibiting broad spectrum 
anti-tumor effects in both leukemia and solid tumors. The purpose of this study 
was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of DBPR114 in the treatment of 
advanced HCC.
METHODS: Human HCC cell lines with histopathology/genetic background similar to 
human HCC tumors were used for in vitro and in vivo studies. Human umbilical 
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used to evaluate the drug effect on 
endothelial tube formation. Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and 
mRNA sequencing were employed to investigate the mechanisms of drug action. 
Xenograft models of sorafenib-refractory and sorafenib-acquired resistant HCC 
were used to evaluate the tumor response to DBPR114.
RESULTS: DBPR114 was active against HCC tumor cell proliferation independent of 
p53 alteration status and tumor grade in vitro. DBPR114-mediated growth 
inhibition in HCC cells was associated with apoptosis induction, cell cycle 
arrest, and polyploidy formation. Further analysis indicated that DBPR114 
reduced the phosphorylation levels of AURKs and its substrate histone H3. 
Moreover, the levels of several active-state receptor tyrosine kinases were 
downregulated by DBPR114, verifying the mechanisms of DBPR114 action as a 
multikinase inhibitor in HCC cells. DBPR114 also exhibited anti-angiogenic 
effect, as demonstrated by inhibiting tumor formation in HUVEC cells. In vivo, 
DBPR114 induced statistically significant tumor growth inhibition compared with 
the vehicle control in multiple HCC tumor xenograft models. Histologic analysis 
revealed that the DBPR114 treatment reduced cell proliferation, and induced 
apoptotic cell death and multinucleated cell formation. Consistent with the 
histological findings, gene expression analysis revealed that DBPR114-modulated 
genes were mostly related to the G2/M checkpoint and mitotic spindle assembly. 
DBPR114 was efficacious against sorafenib-intrinsic and -acquired resistant HCC 
tumors. Notably, DBPR114 significantly delayed posttreatment tumor regrowth and 
prolonged survival compared with the regorafenib group.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that targeting AURK signaling could be a new 
effective molecular-targeted agent in the treatment of patients with HCC.
