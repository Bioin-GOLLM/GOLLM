Aberrant mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics have been reported in cancer 
cells. While post translational modifications are known regulators of the 
mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery, we show that alternative splice variants 
of the fission protein Drp1 (DNM1L) have specific and unique roles in cancer, 
adding to the complexity of mitochondrial fission/fusion regulation in tumor 
cells. Ovarian cancer specimens express an alternative splice transcript variant 
of Drp1 lacking exon 16 of the variable domain, and high expression of this 
splice variant relative to other transcripts is associated with poor patient 
outcome. Unlike the full-length variant, expression of Drp1 lacking exon 16 
leads to decreased association of Drp1 to mitochondrial fission sites, more 
fused mitochondrial networks, enhanced respiration, and TCA cycle metabolites, 
and is associated with a more metastatic phenotype in vitro and in vivo. These 
pro-tumorigenic effects can also be inhibited by specific siRNA-mediated 
inhibition of the endogenously expressed transcript lacking exon 16. Moreover, 
lack of exon 16 abrogates mitochondrial fission in response to pro-apoptotic 
stimuli and leads to decreased sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. These data 
emphasize the significance of the pathophysiological consequences of Drp1 
alternative splicing and divergent functions of Drp1 splice variants, and 
strongly warrant consideration of Drp1 splicing in future studies.
