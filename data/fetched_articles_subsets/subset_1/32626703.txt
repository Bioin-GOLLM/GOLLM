Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCSs) are dynamic contact 
regions with a distance of 10-30 nm between the endoplasmic reticulum and 
mitochondria. Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites regulate various 
biological processes, including lipid transfer, calcium homeostasis, autophagy, 
and mitochondrial dynamics. The dysfunction of ERMCS is closely associated with 
various neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's 
disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this review, we will summarize 
the current knowledge of the components and organization of ERMCSs, the methods 
for monitoring ERMCSs, and the physiological functions of ERMCSs in different 
model systems. Additionally, we will emphasize the current understanding of the 
malfunction of ERMCSs and their potential roles in neurodegenerative diseases.
