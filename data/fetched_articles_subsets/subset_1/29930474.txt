PURPOSE: To report on a clinical and genetic investigation of a large, 
multigenerational South African family of mixed ancestry with autosomal dominant 
congenital cataracts, coloboma, and nystagmus.
METHODS: Ophthalmic examination was performed in 27 individuals from the same 
admixed South African family. DNA was sampled from either peripheral blood or 
buccal swabs in all 27 individuals, and whole genome sequencing was performed in 
six individuals. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the probable mutation in 
the remaining family members.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven family members with 19 affected individuals were included 
in the study. The predominant phenotype, with highly variable expression, was 
congenital cataract (14 individuals), posterior segment coloboma (17 
individuals), and nystagmus (18 individuals). Other features present included 
high myopia, microcornea, and strabismus. An R208W mutation in PAX6 (dbSNP 
rs757259413; HGMDÂ CM930572; NM_000280.3:c.622G>A; NP_000271.1:p.Arg208Trp) was 
identified as being the most probable pathogenic mutation. Cosegregation of the 
mutation with the phenotype was confirmed in all 27 family members.
CONCLUSIONS: PAX6 is a highly conserved gene crucial for normal oculogenesis, 
and although mutations within the gene may cause an array of ocular 
developmental abnormalities, most are associated with aniridia and 
aniridia-related ocular defects. The observation that PAX6 aniridia phenotypes 
are largely associated with nonsense mutations and milder non-aniridia 
phenotypes with missense mutations suggested that there may be specific 
genotype-phenotype correlations for the gene. The R208W mutation in PAX6 
identified in this family challenges this theory as it has previously been 
reported in three unrelated families and is associated with aniridia and 
non-aniridia phenotypes across the four families. PAX6 with its wide phenotypic 
associations and highly variable expression should be considered a candidate 
gene in the diagnostic screen for any ocular developmental abnormality.
