Our previous study showed that the downstream of kinase 3 (DOK3) is degraded 
during macrophage stimulation with CpG. However, the underlying mechanism and 
role in Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling remains elusive. In this study, we 
demonstrate that CpG treatment leads to ubiquitin-mediated degradation of DOK3 
via interaction with an E3 ligase TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). We also 
identified the 27th amino acid (lysine) of DOK3 is responsible for Ly48 
polyubiquitination of DOK3. Furthermore, reintroduction of DOK3 (K27R) into 
DOK3-deficient macrophages abolishes DOK3 degradation induced by CpG and 
suppresses the production of IL-6 and TNFα. More importantly, our study uncovers 
a novel role of an E3 ligase TRAF6, namely, TRAF6 is also able to catalyse Lys 
48 polyubiquitylation of target protein except for Lys 63 polyubiquitylation.
