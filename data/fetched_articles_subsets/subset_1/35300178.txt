Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, recessive X-linked, multisystemic lysosomal 
storage disorder (LSD) that results from a deficiency in the hydrolase 
alpha-galactosidase A (α-GalA) caused by a GLA gene variant. The progressive 
accumulation of the glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in organs such 
as skin, kidney, brain, joints, vascular walls and eyes are responsible for the 
wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, often unspecific. In result, 
clinically relevant and life-threatening complications, such as malignant 
ventricular arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, end stage kidney failure and 
stroke may occur. In this review, we will describe the clinical features and the 
current perspectives in the multidisciplinary management Of FD patients.
