Plants mount coordinated immune responses to defend themselves against 
pathogens. However, the cellular components required for plant immunity are not 
fully understood. The jasmonate-mimicking coronatine (COR) toxin produced by 
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 functions to overcome plant 
immunity. We previously isolated eight Arabidopsis (scord) mutants that exhibit 
increased susceptibility to a COR-deficient mutant of PstDC3000. Among them, the 
scord6 mutant exhibits defects both in stomatal closure response and in 
restricting bacterial multiplication inside the apoplast. However, the identity 
of SCORD6 remained elusive. In this study, we aim to identify the SCORD6 gene. 
We identified SCORD6 via next-generation sequencing and found it to be MURUS1 
(MUR1), which is involved in the biosynthesis of GDP-l-fucose. Discovery of 
SCORD6 as MUR1 led to a series of experiments that revealed a multi-faceted role 
of l-fucose biosynthesis in stomatal and apoplastic defenses as well as in 
pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity, including 
glycosylation of pattern-recognition receptors. Furthermore, compromised 
stomatal and/or apoplastic defenses were observed in mutants of several 
fucosyltransferases with specific substrates (e.g. O-glycan, N-glycan or the 
DELLA transcriptional repressors). Collectively, these results uncover a novel 
and broad role of l-fucose and protein fucosylation in plant immunity.
