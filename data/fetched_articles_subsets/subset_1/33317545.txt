BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal brain tumor characterized by 
high morbidity and limited treatment options. Tumor malignancy is usually 
associated with the epigenetic marks, which coordinate gene expression to 
ascertain relevant phenotypes. One of such marks is m6A modification of RNA, 
whose functional effects are dependent on the YTH family m6A reader proteins.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the expression of five YTH 
family proteins in different GBM microarray datasets from the Oncomine database, 
and identified YTHDF1 as the most highly overexpressed member of this family in 
GBM. By performing the knockdown of YTHDF1 in a GBM cell line, we found that it 
positively regulates proliferation, chemoresistance and cancer stem cell-like 
properties. Musashi-1 (MSI1) is a postranscriptional gene expression regulator 
associated with high oncogenicity in GBM. By knocking down and overexpressing 
MSI1, we found that it positively regulates YTHDF1 expression. The inhibitory 
effects imposed on the processes of proliferation and migration by YTHDF1 
knockdown were shown to be partially rescued by concomitant overexpression of 
MSI1. MSI1 and YTHDF1 were shown to be positively correlated in clinical glioma 
samples, and their concomitant upregulation was associated with decreased 
survival of glioma patients. We identified the direct regulation of YTHDF1 by 
MSI1.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the fact that both proteins are master regulators of gene 
expression, and both of them are unfavorable factors in GBM, we suggest that in 
any future studies aimed to uncover the prognostic value and therapy potential, 
these two proteins should be considered together.
