Cotranslational protein targeting in bacteria is mediated by the signal 
recognition particle (SRP) and FtsY, the bacterial SRP receptor (SR). FtsY is 
homologous to the SRalpha subunit of eukaryotes, which is tethered to the 
membrane via its interaction with the membrane-integral SRbeta subunit. Despite 
the lack of a membrane-anchoring subunit, 30% of FtsY in Escherichia coli are 
found stably associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. However, the mechanisms 
that are involved in this membrane association are only poorly understood. Our 
data indicate that membrane association of FtsY involves two distinct binding 
sites and that binding to both sites is stabilized by blocking its GTPase 
activity. Binding to the first site requires only the NG-domain of FtsY and 
confers protease protection to FtsY. Importantly, the SecY translocon provides 
the second binding site, to which FtsY binds to form a carbonate-resistant 
400-kD FtsY-SecY translocon complex. This interaction is stabilized by the 
N-terminal A-domain of FtsY, which probably serves as a transient lipid anchor.
