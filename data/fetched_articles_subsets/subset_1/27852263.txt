BACKGROUND: In recent decades middle-income countries have experienced a rapid 
increase in the number of cars and motorcycles. Increased deaths and 
hospitalizations due to road traffic injuries (RTI) has been observed in several 
countries as a result. In this study we assessed the determinants of RTIs in 
Brazil by mode of transportation and compared differences in RTI rates among 
macro-regions.
METHODS: We used data from the National Health Survey (NHS) conducted in 2013 by 
the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Ministry of Health. 
NHS is a comprehensive household survey which includes a representative sample 
(N = 60,198) of individuals aged 18 years or older. The prevalence and 
determinants of RTI were estimated according to different modes of transport 
(car/van, motorcycle, and other) and regions of the country. Bivariate and 
multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess crude and 
adjusted odds ratios, respectively, and their 95 % CI for RTI determinants.
RESULTS: The prevalence of RTI for the Southeast, South, Central-West, Northeast 
and North regions of Brazil was 2.4 %, 2.9 %, 4.4 %, 3.4 % and 4.8 %, 
respectively, pointing to important differences among regions. High percentages 
of motorcyclists were observed in the Northeast and North regions. For 
motorcyclists, factors associated with RTIs were being male (OR = 2.6;95 % 
CI:2.3;3.0), aged 18-29 (OR = 3.2; 95 % CI:2.7;3.8) and 30-39 years (OR = 2.0;95 
% CI:1.7;2.5), black (OR = 1.4;95 % CI:1.1;1.7), having elementary educational 
(OR = 1.5;95 % CI:1.1;1.9), reporting binge drinking behavior (OR = 1.3;95 % 
CI:1.1;1.5), and living in the Central-West (OR = 2.0;95 % CI:1.6;2.5), 
Northeast (OR = 1.8;95 % CI:1.5;2.1) and North (OR = 2.0;95 % CI:1.6; 2.5) 
regions of the country. The independent variables associated with RTI for 
car/van occupants were being male (OR = 1.7;95 % CI:1.4;2.1), aged 18-29 
(OR = 1.5;95 % CI:1.1;2.0) and 30-39 years (OR = 2.5;95 % CI:1.9;3.2), reporting 
binge drinking behavior (OR = 2.0;95 % CI:1.6;2.5) and living in the South 
region (OR = 1.6;95 % CI:1.3;2.1).
CONCLUSIONS: There were considerable regional disparities in RTI rates across 
Brazil's regions. Motorcyclists contributed to the high RTI rates in these 
regions as did demographic factors and behaviors such as alcohol use. These 
findings can help guide interventions to reduce the burden of RTIs in Brazil.
