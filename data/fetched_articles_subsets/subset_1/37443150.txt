The biological basis of the neurodegenerative movement disorder, Parkinson's 
disease (PD), is still unclear despite it being 'discovered' over 200 years ago 
in Western Medicine. Based on current PD knowledge, there are widely varying 
theories as to its pathobiology. The aim of this article was to explore some of 
these different theories by summarizing the viewpoints of laboratory and 
clinician scientists in the PD field, on the biological basis of the disease. To 
achieve this aim, we posed this question to thirteen "PD experts" from six 
continents (for global representation) and collated their personal opinions into 
this article. The views were varied, ranging from toxin exposure as a PD 
trigger, to LRRK2 as a potential root cause, to toxic alpha-synuclein being the 
most important etiological contributor. Notably, there was also growing 
recognition that the definition of PD as a single disease should be 
reconsidered, perhaps each with its own unique pathobiology and treatment 
regimen.
