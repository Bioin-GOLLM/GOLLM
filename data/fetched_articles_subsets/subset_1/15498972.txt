Hypertension and dyslipidemia are risk factors for atherosclerosis and occur 
together more often than expected by chance. Although this clustering suggests 
shared causation, unifying factors remain unknown. We describe a large kindred 
with a syndrome including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and 
hypomagnesemia. Each phenotype is transmitted on the maternal lineage with a 
pattern indicating mitochondrial inheritance. Analysis of the mitochondrial 
genome of the maternal lineage identified a homoplasmic mutation substituting 
cytidine for uridine immediately 5' to the mitochondrial transfer RNA(Ile) 
anticodon. Uridine at this position is nearly invariate among transfer RNAs 
because of its role in stabilizing the anticodon loop. Given the known loss of 
mitochondrial function with aging, these findings may have implications for the 
common clustering of these metabolic disorders.
