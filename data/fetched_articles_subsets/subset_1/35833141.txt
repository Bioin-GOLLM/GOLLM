Colorectal cancer is a highly malignant cancer with poor prognosis and mortality 
rates. As the first biological agent approved for metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC), bevacizumab was confirmed to exhibit good performance when combined with 
chemotherapy and immunotherapy. However, the efficacy of both bevacizumab and 
immunotherapy is highly heterogeneous across CRC patients with different stages. 
Thus, exploring a novel biomarker to comprehensively assess the prognosis and 
bevacizumab and immunotherapy response of CRC is of great significance. In our 
study, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to identify 
bevacizumab-related genes. After verification in four public cohorts and our 
internal cohort, ALOX12 was identified as a key gene related to bevacizumab 
response. Prognostic analysis and in vitro experiments further demonstrated that 
ALOX12 was closely associated with the prognosis, tumor proliferation, invasion, 
and metastasis. Multi-omics data analysis based on mutation and copy number 
variation (CNV) revealed that RYR3 drove the expression of ALOX12 and the 
deletion of 17p12 inhibited ALOX12 expression, respectively. Moreover, we 
interrogated the relationship between ALOX12 and immune cells and checkpoints. 
The results exhibited that high ALOX12 expression predicted a higher immune 
infiltration and better immunotherapy response, which was further validated in 
Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) and Subclass Mapping (SubMap) 
methods. Above all, our study provides a stable biomarker for clinical protocol 
optimization, prognostic assessment, precise treatment, and individualized 
treatment of CRC.
