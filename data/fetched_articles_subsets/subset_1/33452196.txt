OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether uveitis is a predictor of acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) among patients with Behcet's disease (BD).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Patients with BD were retrieved from the whole population of the Taiwan 
National Health Insurance Research Database from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 
2013.
PARTICIPANTS: Among the 6508 patients with BD, 2517 (38.7%) were in the uveitis 
group and 3991 were in the non-uveitis group.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to 
compare the cumulative hazard of AMI in the uveitis and non-uveitis groups. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the adjusted HRs and 
95% CI of AMI, and was adjusted for age, gender, systemic comorbidities (eg, 
hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, smoking) and clinical manifestation of 
BD (eg, oral ulcers, genital ulcers, skin lesions, arthritis and 
gastrointestinal involvement).
RESULTS: The mean age of the BD cohort was 38.1±15.1 years. Compared with 
non-uveitis patients, uveitis patients were significantly younger and male 
predominant. There was no significant difference between the two groups for most 
proportions of systemic comorbidities and clinical manifestations. The 
Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test showed that the uveitis group had a 
significantly higher cumulative hazard for patients with AMI compared with the 
non-uveitis group (p<0.0001). In the multivariable Cox regression after 
adjustment for confounding factors, patients with uveitis had a significantly 
higher risk of AMI (adjusted HR 1.87; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.29). Other significant 
risk factors for AMI were age, hypertension, smoking, and skin lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Statistical analyses from the nationwide database demonstrated that 
uveitis is a potential predictor of AMI in patients with BD.
