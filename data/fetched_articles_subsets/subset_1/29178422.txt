Loss-of-function DCAF17 variants cause hypogonadism, partial alopecia, diabetes 
mellitus, mental retardation, and deafness with variable clinical presentation. 
DCAF17 pathogenic variants have been largely reported in the Middle Eastern 
populations, but the incidence in American families is rare and animal models 
are lacking. Exome sequencing in 5 women with syndromic hypergonadotropic 
hypogonadism from 2 unrelated families revealed novel pathogenic variants in the 
DCAF17 gene. DCAF17 exon 2 (c.127-1G > C) novel homozygous variants were 
discovered in 4 Turkish siblings, while 1 American was compound heterozygous for 
1-stop gain variant in exon 5 (c.C535T; p.Gln179*) and previously described stop 
gain variant in exon 9 (c.G906A; p.Trp302*). A mouse model mimicking loss of 
function in exon 2 of Dcaf17 was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and showed female 
subfertility and male infertility. Our results identify 2 novel variants, and 
show that Dcaf17 plays a significant role in mammalian gonadal development and 
infertility.
