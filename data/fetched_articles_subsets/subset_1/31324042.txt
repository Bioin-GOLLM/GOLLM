We recently reported that SF2312 ((1,5-dihydroxy-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)phosphonic 
acid), a phosphonate antibiotic with a previously unknown mode of action, is a 
potent inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme, Enolase. SF2312 can only be 
synthesized as a racemic-diastereomeric mixture. However, co-crystal structures 
with Enolase 2 (ENO2) have consistently shown that only the (3S,5S)-enantiomer 
binds to the active site. The acidity of the alpha proton at C-3, which 
deprotonates under mildly alkaline conditions, results in racemization; thus 
while the separation of four enantiomeric intermediates was achieved via chiral 
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) of the fully protected 
intermediate, deprotection inevitably nullified enantiopurity. To prevent 
epimerization of the C-3, we designed and synthesized MethylSF2312, 
((1,5-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)phosphonic acid), which contains a 
fully-substituted C-3 alpha carbon. As a racemic-diastereomeric mixture, 
MethylSF2312 is equipotent to SF2312 in enzymatic and cellular systems against 
Enolase. Chiral HPLC separation of a protected MethylSF2312 precursor resulted 
in the efficient separation of the four enantiomers. After deprotection and 
inevitable re-equilibration of the anomeric C-5, (3S)-MethylSF2312 was up to 
2000-fold more potent than (3R)-MethylSF2312 in an isolated enzymatic assay. 
This observation strongly correlates with biological activity in both human 
cancer cells and bacteria for the 3S enantiomer of SF2312. Novel X-ray 
structures of human ENO2 with chiral and racemic MethylSF2312 show that only 
(3S,5S)-enantiomer occupies the active site. Enolase inhibition is thus a direct 
result of binding by the (3S,5S)-enantiomer of MethylSF2312. Concurrent with 
these results for MethylSF2312, we contend that the (3S,5S)-SF2312 is the single 
active enantiomer of inhibitor SF2312.
