Tryptophan 2,3‑dioxygenase (TDO2) is a key rate‑limiting enzyme in the 
kynurenine pathway and promotes tumor growth and escape from immune surveillance 
in different types of cancer. The present study aimed to investigate whether 
TDO2 serves a role in the development of ovarian cancer. Reverse 
transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to detect the 
expression of TDO2 in different cell lines. The effects of TDO2 overexpression, 
TDO2 knockdown and TDO2 inhibitor on ovarian cancer cell proliferation, 
migration and invasion were determined by MTS, colony formation and Transwell 
assays. The expression of TDO2 in ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues 
and fallopian tube tissues were analyzed using the gene expression data from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype‑Tissue Expression project. Immune cell 
infiltration in cancer tissues was evaluated using the single sample gene set 
enrichment analysis algorithm. The present study found that RasV12‑mediated 
oncogenic transformation was accompanied by the upregulation of TDO2. In 
addition, it was demonstrated that TDO2 was upregulated in ovarian cancer 
tissues compared with normal ovarian tissues. TDO2 overexpression promoted 
proliferation, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, whereas TDO2 
knockdown repressed these phenotypes. Treatment with LM10, a TDO2 inhibitor, 
also repressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer 
cells. The present study indicated that TDO2 can be used as a new target for the 
treatment of ovarian cancer.
