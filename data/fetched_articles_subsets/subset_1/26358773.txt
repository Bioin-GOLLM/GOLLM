Congenital sodium diarrhea (CSD) refers to an intractable diarrhea of 
intrauterine onset with high fecal sodium loss. CSD is clinically and 
genetically heterogeneous. Syndromic CSD is caused by SPINT2 mutations. While we 
recently described four cases of the non-syndromic form of CSD that were caused 
by dominant activating mutations in intestinal receptor guanylate cyclase C 
(GC-C), the genetic cause for the majority of CSD is still unknown. Therefore, 
we aimed to determine the genetic cause for non-GC-C non-syndromic CSD in 18 
patients from 16 unrelated families applying whole-exome sequencing and/or 
chromosomal microarray analyses and/or direct Sanger sequencing. SLC9A3 
missense, splicing and truncation mutations, including an instance of 
uniparental disomy, and whole-gene deletion were identified in nine patients 
from eight families with CSD. Two of these nine patients developed inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) at 4 and 16 years of age. SLC9A3 encodes Na(+)/H(+) 
antiporter 3 (NHE3), which is the major intestinal brush-border Na(+)/H(+) 
exchanger. All mutations were in the NHE3 N-terminal transport domain, and all 
missense mutations were in the putative membrane-spanning domains. Identified 
SLC9A3 missense mutations were functionally characterized in plasma membrane NHE 
null fibroblasts. SLC9A3 missense mutations compromised NHE3 activity by 
reducing basal surface expression and/or loss of basal transport function of 
NHE3 molecules, whereas acute regulation was normal. This study identifies 
recessive mutations in NHE3, a downstream target of GC-C, as a cause of CSD and 
implies primary basal NHE3 malfunction as a predisposition for IBD in a subset 
of patients.
