INTRODUCTION: In pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT), a bifunctional antibody 
is administered and allowed to pre-localize to tumor cells. Subsequently, a 
chelated radionuclide is administered and captured by cell-bound antibody while 
unbound hapten clears rapidly from the body. We aim to engineer high-affinity 
binders to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) 
chelates for use in PRIT applications.
METHODS: We mathematically modeled antibody and hapten pharmacokinetics to 
analyze hapten tumor retention as a function of hapten binding affinity. 
Motivated by model predictions, we used directed evolution and yeast surface 
display to affinity mature the 2D12.5 antibody to DOTA, reformatted as a single 
chain variable fragment (scFv).
RESULTS: Modeling predicts that for high antigen density and saturating bsAb 
dose, a hapten-binding affinity of 100 pM is needed for near-maximal hapten 
retention. We affinity matured 2D12.5 with an initial binding constant of about 
10 nM to DOTA-yttrium chelates. Affinity maturation resulted in a 1000-fold 
affinity improvement to biotinylated DOTA-yttrium, yielding an 8.2±1.9 picomolar 
binder. The high-affinity scFv binds DOTA complexes of lutetium and gadolinium 
with similar picomolar affinity and indium chelates with low nanomolar affinity. 
When engineered into a bispecific antibody construct targeting carcinoembryonic 
antigen, pretargeted high-affinity scFv results in significantly higher tumor 
retention of a (111)In-DOTA hapten compared to pretargeted wild-type scFv in a 
xenograft mouse model.
CONCLUSIONS: We have engineered a versatile, high-affinity, DOTA-chelate-binding 
scFv. We anticipate it will prove useful in developing pretargeted imaging and 
therapy protocols to exploit the potential of a variety of radiometals.
