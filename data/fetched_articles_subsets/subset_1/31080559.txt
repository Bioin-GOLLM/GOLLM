The growth of primary tumors as well as metastatic neoplastic lesions is 
strongly dependent on the cancer cells' ability to initiate their own vascular 
network. This process, angiogenesis, which involves the proliferation, 
migration, and invasion of endothelial cells, is critically dependent on a 
variety of signaling molecules that target specific receptors, most notably 
tyrosine kinases. One receptor tyrosine kinase associated with poor prognosis, 
metastasis, and outcome in a variety of tumor types, is Axl. Although the role 
of Axl in tumor cell migration and invasion are well recognized, little is known 
about the involvement of Axl signaling in the initiation of angiogenesis. Here, 
we show that Axl inhibition in tumor cells decreases the secretion of 
pro-angiogenic factors and impairs functional properties of endothelial cells in 
vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that Axl signaling is an important 
contributor to tumor angiogenesis.
