The molybdate importer (ModBC-A of Archaeoglobus fulgidus) and the vitamin B12 
importer (BtuCD-F of Escherichia coli) are members of the type I and type II ABC 
importer families. Here we study the influence of substrate and nucleotide 
binding on complex formation and stability. Using native mass spectrometry we 
show that the interaction between the periplasmic substrate-binding protein 
(SBP) ModA and the transporter ModBC is dependent upon binding of molybdate. By 
contrast, vitamin B12 disrupts interactions between the transporter BtuCD and 
the SBP BtuF. Moreover, while ATP binds cooperatively to BtuCD-F, and acts 
synergistically with vitamin B12 to destabilize the BtuCD-F complex, no effect 
is observed for ATP binding on the stability of ModBC-A. These observations not 
only highlight the ability of mass spectrometry to capture these importer-SBP 
complexes but allow us to add molecular detail to proposed transport mechanisms.
