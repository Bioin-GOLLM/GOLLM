Viral infection depends on a complex interplay between host and viral factors. 
Here, we link host susceptibility to viral infection to a network encompassing 
sulfur metabolism, tRNA modification, competitive binding, and programmed 
ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). We first demonstrate that the iron-sulfur cluster 
biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli exerts a protective effect during 
lambda phage infection, while a tRNA thiolation pathway enhances viral 
infection. We show that tRNA(Lys) uridine 34 modification inhibits PRF to 
influence the ratio of lambda phage proteins gpG and gpGT. Computational 
modeling and experiments suggest that the role of the iron-sulfur cluster 
biosynthesis pathway in infection is indirect, via competitive binding of the 
shared sulfur donor IscS. Based on the universality of many key components of 
this network, in both the host and the virus, we anticipate that these findings 
may have broad relevance to understanding other infections, including viral 
infection of humans.
