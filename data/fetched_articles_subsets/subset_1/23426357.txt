We have created a completely helper cell-dependent morbillivirus by modifying 
the genome to remove the coding sequence of the phosphoprotein (P) and 
recovering the recombinant virus in a cell line constitutively expressing the P 
protein. The P protein-deleted virus (P(-)) grew very inefficiently unless both 
of the viral accessory proteins (V and C) were also expressed. Growth of the 
virus was restricted to the P-expressing cell line. The P(-) virus grew more 
slowly than the parental virus and expressed much less viral protein in infected 
cells. The technique could be used to create virus-like particles for use as a 
vaccine or as antigen in immunological or serological assays.
