Protein citrullination catalysed by peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) may play an 
important pathogenic role in several chronic inflammatory diseases and 
malignancies. PAD2, PAD4, and citrullinated proteins are found in the synovium 
of rheumatoid arthritis patients. PAD activity is dependent on calcium and 
reducing conditions. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to 
induce citrullination of histones in granulocytes. Here we examine the ability 
of H2O2 and leukocyte-derived ROS to regulate PAD activity using citrullination 
of fibrinogen as read-out. H2O2 at concentrations above 40 µM inhibited the 
catalytic activity of PAD2 and PAD4 in a dose-dependent manner. PMA-stimulated 
leukocytes citrullinated fibrinogen and this citrullination was markedly 
enhanced when ROS formation was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor 
diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). In contrast, PAD released from stimulated leukocytes 
was unaffected by exogenously added H2O2 at concentrations up to 1000 µM. The 
role of ROS in regulating PAD activity may play an important part in preventing 
hypercitrullination of proteins.
