Activation of insulin receptor (IR) initiates a cascade of conformational 
changes and autophosphorylation events. Herein, we determined three structures 
of IR trapped by aptamers using cryo-electron microscopy. The A62 agonist 
aptamer selectively activates metabolic signaling. In the absence of insulin, 
the two A62 aptamer agonists of IR adopt an insulin-accessible arrowhead 
conformation by mimicking site-1/site-2' insulin coordination. Insulin binding 
at one site triggers conformational changes in one protomer, but this movement 
is blocked in the other protomer by A62 at the opposite site. A62 binding 
captures two unique conformations of IR with a similar stalk arrangement, which 
underlie Tyr1150 mono-phosphorylation (m-pY1150) and selective activation for 
metabolic signaling. The A43 aptamer, a positive allosteric modulator, binds at 
the opposite side of the insulin-binding module, and stabilizes the single 
insulin-bound IR structure that brings two FnIII-3 regions into closer proximity 
for full activation. Our results suggest that spatial proximity of the two 
FnIII-3 ends is important for m-pY1150, but multi-phosphorylation of IR requires 
additional conformational rearrangement of intracellular domains mediated by 
coordination between extracellular and transmembrane domains.
