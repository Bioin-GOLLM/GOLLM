Steroid hormones are ancient signaling molecules found in vertebrates and 
insects alike. Both taxa show intriguing parallels with respect to how steroids 
function and how their synthesis is regulated. As such, insects are excellent 
models for studying universal aspects of steroid physiology. Here, we present a 
comprehensive genomic and genetic analysis of the principal steroid 
hormone-producing organs in two popular insect models, Drosophila and Bombyx. We 
identified 173 genes with previously unknown specific expression in 
steroid-producing cells, 15 of which had critical roles in development. The 
insect neuropeptide PTTH and its vertebrate counterpart ACTH both regulate 
steroid production, but molecular targets of these pathways remain poorly 
characterized. Identification of PTTH-dependent gene sets identified the nuclear 
receptor HR4 as a highly conserved target in both Drosophila and Bombyx. We 
consider this study to be a critical step toward understanding how steroid 
hormone production and release are regulated in all animal models.
