Degradation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by selective autophagy (ER-phagy) is 
crucial for ER homeostasis. However, it remains unclear how ER scission is 
regulated for subsequent autophagosomal sequestration and lysosomal degradation. 
Here, we show that oligomerization of ER-phagy receptor FAM134B (also referred 
to as reticulophagy regulator 1 or RETREG1) through its reticulon-homology 
domain is required for membrane fragmentation in vitro and ER-phagy in vivo. 
Under ER-stress conditions, activated CAMK2B phosphorylates the 
reticulon-homology domain of FAM134B, which enhances FAM134B oligomerization and 
activity in membrane fragmentation to accommodate high demand for ER-phagy. 
Unexpectedly, FAM134B G216R, a variant derived from a type II hereditary sensory 
and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) patient, exhibits gain-of-function defects, such 
as hyperactive self-association and membrane scission, which results in 
excessive ER-phagy and sensory neuron death. Therefore, this study reveals a 
mechanism of ER membrane fragmentation in ER-phagy, along with a signaling 
pathway in regulating ER turnover, and suggests a potential implication of 
excessive selective autophagy in human diseases.
