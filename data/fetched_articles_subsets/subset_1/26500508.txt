The amygdala plays a critical role in emotion processing and psychiatric 
disorders associated with emotion dysfunction. Accumulating evidence suggests 
that amygdala structure is modulated by serotonin-related genes. However, there 
is a gap between the small contributions of single loci (less than 1%) and the 
reported 63-65% heritability of amygdala structure. To understand the "missing 
heritability," we systematically explored the contribution of serotonin genes on 
amygdala structure at the gene set level. The present study of 417 healthy 
Chinese volunteers examined 129 representative polymorphisms in genes from 
multiple biological mechanisms in the regulation of serotonin neurotransmission. 
A system-level approach using multiple regression analyses identified that nine 
SNPs collectively accounted for approximately 8% of the variance in amygdala 
volume. Permutation analyses showed that the probability of obtaining these 
findings by chance was low (p = 0.043, permuted for 1000 times). Findings showed 
that serotonin genes contribute moderately to individual differences in amygdala 
volume in a healthy Chinese sample. These results indicate that the system-level 
approach can help us to understand the genetic basis of a complex trait such as 
amygdala structure.
