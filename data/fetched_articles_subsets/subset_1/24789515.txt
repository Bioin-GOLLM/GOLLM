Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder of 
lysine catabolism caused by mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene. We report 2 patients 
with normal neurocognitive outcome (full-scale IQ of 108 and 74) and their more 
than 10 years' treatment outcome on pyridoxine monotherapy. Both patients had 
specific borderline impairments in visual processing speed. More long-term 
treatment outcome reports will increase our knowledge about the natural history 
of the disease.
