Detailed understanding of the signaling intermediates that confer the sensing of 
intracellular viral nucleic acids for induction of type I interferons is 
critical for strategies to curtail viral mechanisms that impede innate immune 
defenses. Here we show that the activation of the microtubule-associated guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1, encoded by Arhgef2, is essential for sensing 
of foreign RNA by RIG-I-like receptors. Activation of GEF-H1 controls 
RIG-I-dependent and Mda5-dependent phosphorylation of IRF3 and induction of 
IFN-Î² expression in macrophages. Generation of Arhgef2(-/-) mice revealed a 
pronounced signaling defect that prevented antiviral host responses to 
encephalomyocarditis virus and influenza A virus. Microtubule networks sequester 
GEF-H1 that upon activation is released to enable antiviral signaling by 
intracellular nucleic acid detection pathways.
