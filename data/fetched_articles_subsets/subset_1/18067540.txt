The ArsAB extrusion pump encoded by the ars operon of Escherichia coli plasmid 
R773 confers resistance to the toxic trivalent metalloids arsenite [As(III)] and 
antimonite [Sb(III)]. The ArsA ATPase, the catalytic subunit of the pump, has 
two homologous halves, A1 and A2. At the interface of these two halves are two 
nucleotide-binding domains and a metalloid-binding domain. Cys-113 and Cys-422 
have been shown to form a high-affinity metalloid binding site. The crystal 
structure of ArsA shows two other bound metalloid atoms, one liganded to Cys-172 
and His-453, and the other liganded to His-148 and Ser-420. The contribution of 
those putative metalloid sites was examined. There was little effect of 
mutagenesis of residues His-148 and Ser-420 on metalloid binding. However, a 
C172A ArsA mutant and C172A/H453A double mutant exhibited significantly 
decreased affinity for Sb(III). These results suggest first that there is only a 
single high-affinity metalloid binding site in ArsA, and second that Cys-172 
controls the affinity of this site for metalloid and hence the efficiency of 
metalloactivation of the ArsAB efflux pump.
