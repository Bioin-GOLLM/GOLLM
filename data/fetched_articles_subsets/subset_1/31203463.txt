PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a subset of joint disorders resulting 
in degeneration of synovial joints. This leads to pain, disability and loss of 
independence. Knee and hip OA are extremely prevalent, and their occurrence 
increases with ageing. Similarly, loss of muscle mass and function, sarcopenia, 
occurs during ageing.
RECENT FINDINGS: Little is known about the impact of muscle wasting on OA 
progression; nevertheless, it has been suggested that muscle wasting directly 
affects the stability of the joints and loss of mobility leads to gradual 
degeneration of articular cartilage. The molecular mechanisms underlying muscle 
wasting in OA are not well understood; however, these are probably related to 
changes in gene expression, as well as epigenetic modifications. It is becoming 
clear that skeletal muscle wasting plays an important role in OA development 
and/or progression. Here, we discuss mechanisms, current interventions, such as 
exercise, and potentially novel approaches, such as modulation of microRNAs, 
aiming at ameliorating OA symptoms through maintaining muscle mass and function.
