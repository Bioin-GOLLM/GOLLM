OBJECTIVE: Mutation screening was performed to a Chinese family with 
hypokalaemic periodic paraiysis(HOKPP) for locating the corresponding mutations 
of gene and for specifying the clinical features associated with mutations.
METHODS: The cilnical features of patients from HOKPP family were summurized. 
Techniques of target exon PCR and direct sequencing were used to screen the 
mutation in CACNA1S and SCN4A genes in all numbers of the family.
RESULTS: Two patients of the family showed the typical features of HOKPP: the 
age of disease onset is during the childhood, acetazolamide is effective to 
patients treated. A heterozygous point mutation 3716 (G>A) causing R1239H was 
found in exon 30 of CACNA1S gene of the patients, but not found in normal 
members of the family.
CONCLUSION: The mutant R1239H in CACNA1S gene exists in Chinese patients with 
familial hypokalaemic periodic paralysis.
