BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the most common autosomal recessive 
disease in children, and the diagnosis is complicated and difficult, especially 
at early stage. Early diagnosis of SMA is able to improve the outcome of SMA 
patients. In our study, Real-time PCR was developed to measure the gene mutation 
or deletion of key genes for SMA and to further analyse genotype-phenotype 
correlation.
METHODS: The multiple real-time PCR for detecting the mutations of survival of 
motor neuron (SMN), apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) and general 
transcription factor IIH, polypeptide 2 gene (GTF2H2) was established and 
confirmed by DNA sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification 
(MLPA). The diagnosis and prognosis of 141 hospitalized children, 100 normal 
children and further 2000 cases of dry blood spot (DBS) samples were analysed by 
this multiple real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The multiple real-time PCR was established and the accuracy of it to 
detect the mutations of SMN, NAIP and GTF2H2 was at least 98.8 % comparing with 
DNA sequencing and MLPA. Among 141 limb movement disorders children, 75 cases 
were SMA. 71 cases of SMA (94.67 %) were with SMN c.840 mutation, 9 cases (12 %) 
with NAIP deletion and 3 cases (4 %) with GTF2H2 deletion. The multiple 
real-time PCR was able to diagnose and predict the prognosis of SMA patients. 
Simultaneously, the real-time PCR was applied to detect trace DNA from DBS and 
able to make an early diagnosis of SMA.
CONCLUSION: The clinical and molecular characteristics of SMA in Southwest of 
China were presented. Our work provides a novel way for detecting SMA in 
children by using real-time PCR and the potential usage in newborn screening for 
early diagnosis of SMA.
