BACKGROUND: Germline mutations of BRCA1/2 are associated with hereditary breast 
and ovarian cancer. Recent data suggests excess mortality in mutation carriers 
beyond that conferred by neoplasia, and recent in vivo and in vitro studies 
suggest a modulatory role for BRCA proteins in endothelial and cardiomyocyte 
function. We therefore tested the association of BRCA2 variants with clinical 
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: Using data from 1,170 individuals included in two multi-ethnic 
population-based studies (SHARE and SHARE-AP), the association between BRCA2 
variants and CVD was evaluated. 15 SNPs in BRCA2 with minor allele frequencies 
(MAF)â€‰> 0.01 had been previously genotyped using the cardiovascular gene-centric 
50 k SNP array. 115 individuals (9.8%) reported a CVD event, defined as 
myocardial infarction (MI), angina, silent MI, stroke, and angioplasty or 
coronary artery bypass surgery. Analyses were adjusted for age and sex. The SNPs 
rs11571836 and rs1799943 were subsequently genotyped using the MassARRAY 
platform in 1,045 cases of incident MI and 1,135 controls from the South Asian 
subset of an international case-control study of acute MI (INTERHEART), and 
rs11571836 was imputed in 4,686 cases and 4500 controls from the Pakistan Risk 
of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS).
RESULTS: Two BRCA2 SNPs, rs11571836 and rs1799943, both located in untranslated 
regions, were associated with lower risk of CVD (OR 0.47 p = 0.01 and OR 0.56 p 
= 0.03 respectively) in the SHARE studies. Analysis by specific ethnicities 
demonstrated an association with CVD for both SNPs in Aboriginal People, and for 
rs11571836 only in South Asians. No association was observed in the European and 
Chinese subgroups. A non-significant trend towards an association between 
rs11571836 and lower risk of MI was observed in South Asians from INTERHEART [OR 
= 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75-1.01) p = 0.068], but was not evident in PROMIS [OR = 0.96 
(95% CI: 0.90-1.03) p = 0.230]. Meta-analysis of both case-control studies 
resulted in a combined OR of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89-1.004, p = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: Although there was an association between two SNPs in BRCA2 and CVD 
in a multi-ethnic population, these results were not replicated in two South 
Asian case-control studies of incident MI. Future studies exploring the 
association between BRCA variants and cardiovascular disorders are needed to 
clarify the role, if any, for BRCA variants in CVD pathogenesis.
