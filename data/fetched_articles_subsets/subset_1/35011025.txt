In recent years, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide has 
become a research hotspot because of its essential role in maintaining human 
blood pressure balance. In this study, two novel ACE inhibitory peptides of 
Val-Glu-Arg-Gly-Arg-Arg-lle-Thr-Ser-Val 
(Valine-Glutamate-Arginine-Glycine-Arginine-Arginine-Isoleucine-Threonine-Serine-Valine, 
VERGRRITSV) and Phe-Val-Ile-Glu-Pro-Asn-Ile-Thr-Pro-Ala 
(Phenylalanine-Valine-Isoleucine-Glutamate-Proline-Asparagine-Isoleucine-Threonine-Proline-Alanine, 
FVIEPNITPA) were isolated and purified from defatted walnut meal hydrolysates 
through a series of preparation processes including ultrafiltration, Sephadex 
G-15 gel chromatography, and reverse high performance liquid chromatography 
(RP-HPLC). Both peptides showed high ACE inhibitory activities. The molecular 
docking study revealed that VERGRRITSV and FVIEPNITPA were primarily attributed 
to the formation of strong hydrogen bonds with the active pockets of ACE. The 
binding free energies of VERGRRITSV and FVIEPNITPA with ACE were -14.99 and 
-14.69 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, these ACE inhibitory peptides showed 
good stability against gastrointestinal enzymes digestion and common food 
processing conditions (e.g., temperature and pH, sugar, and salt treatments). 
Furthermore, animal experiment results indicated that the administration of 
VERGRRITSV or FVIEPNITPA exhibited antihypertensive effects in spontaneously 
hypertensive rats. Our results demonstrated that walnut could be a potential 
source of bioactive peptides with ACE inhibitory activity.
