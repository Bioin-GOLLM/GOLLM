The AKT kinases have emerged as promising therapeutic targets in oncology and 
both allosteric and ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors have entered clinical 
investigation. However, long-term efficacy of such inhibitors will likely be 
challenged by the development of resistance. We have established prostate cancer 
models of acquired resistance to the allosteric inhibitor MK-2206 or the 
ATP-competitive inhibitor ipatasertib following prolonged exposure. While 
alterations in AKT are associated with acquired resistance to MK-2206, 
ipatasertib resistance is driven by rewired compensatory activity of parallel 
signaling pathways. Importantly, MK-2206 resistance can be overcome by treatment 
with ipatasertib, while ipatasertib resistance can be reversed by co-treatment 
with inhibitors of pathways including PIM signaling. These findings demonstrate 
that distinct resistance mechanisms arise to the two classes of AKT inhibitors 
and that combination approaches may reverse resistance to ATP-competitive 
inhibition.
