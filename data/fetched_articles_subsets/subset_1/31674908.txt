We previously reported a CRISPR-mediated knock-in strategy into introns of 
Drosophila genes, generating an attP-FRT-SA-T2A-GAL4-polyA-3XP3-EGFP-FRT-attP 
transgenic library for multiple uses (Lee et al., 2018a). The method relied on 
double stranded DNA (dsDNA) homology donors with ~1 kb homology arms. Here, we 
describe three new simpler ways to edit genes in flies. We create single 
stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors using PCR and add 100 nt of homology on each side of 
an integration cassette, followed by enzymatic removal of one strand. Using this 
method, we generated GFP-tagged proteins that mark organelles in S2 cells. We 
then describe two dsDNA methods using cheap synthesized donors flanked by 100 nt 
homology arms and gRNA target sites cloned into a plasmid. Upon injection, donor 
DNA (1 to 5 kb) is released from the plasmid by Cas9. The cassette integrates 
efficiently and precisely in vivo. The approach is fast, cheap, and scalable.
