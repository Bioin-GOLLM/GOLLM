Zoonotic West Nile virus (WNV) circulates in natural transmission cycles 
involving certain mosquitoes and birds, horses, humans, and a range of other 
vertebrates are incidental hosts. Clinical infections in humans can range in 
severity from uncomplicated WNV fever to fatal meningoencephalitis. Since its 
introduction to the Western Hemisphere in 1999, WNV had spread across North 
America, Central and South America and the Caribbean, although the vast majority 
of severe human cases have occurred in the United States of America (USA) and 
Canada. By 2002-2003, the WNV outbreaks have involved thousands of patients 
causing severe neurologic disease (meningoencephalitis and poliomyelitis-like 
syndrome) and hundreds of associated fatalities in USA. The purpose of this 
review is to present recent information on the epidemiology and pathogenicity of 
WNV since its emergence in North America.
