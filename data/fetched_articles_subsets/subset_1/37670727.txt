Coding sequence variants comprise a small fraction of the germline genetic 
variability of the human genome. However, they often cause deleterious change in 
protein function and are therefore associated with pathogenic phenotypes. To 
identify novel pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk loci, we carried out 
a complete scan of all common missense and synonymous SNPs and analysed them in 
a case-control study comprising four different populations, for a total of 14 
538 PDAC cases and 190 657 controls. We observed a statistically significant 
association between 13q12.2-rs9581957-T and PDAC risk (P = 2.46 × 10-9), that is 
in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a deleterious missense variant (rs9579139) 
of the URAD gene. Recent findings suggest that this gene is active in 
peroxisomes. Considering that peroxisomes have a key role as molecular 
scavengers, especially in eliminating reactive oxygen species, a malfunctioning 
URAD protein might expose the cell to a higher load of potentially DNA damaging 
molecules and therefore increase PDAC risk. The association was observed in 
individuals of European and Asian ethnicity. We also observed the association of 
the missense variant 15q24.1-rs2277598-T, that belongs to BBS4 gene, with 
increased PDAC risk (P = 1.53 × 10-6). rs2277598 is associated with body mass 
index and is in LD with diabetes susceptibility loci. In conclusion, we 
identified two missense variants associated with the risk of developing PDAC 
independently from the ethnicity highlighting the importance of conducting 
reanalysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in light of functional 
data.
