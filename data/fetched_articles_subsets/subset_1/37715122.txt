BACKGROUND: Spinal neuraxis leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) relapse in 
glioblastoma is an uncommon event that is challenging to manage. This study aims 
to determine the incidence, associated factors, and outcome of LM relapse in 
patients with glioblastoma managed with radical intent.
METHODS: Patients managed for glioblastoma using the EORTC-NCIC (Stupp) Protocol 
from 2007 to 2019 were entered into a prospective ethics-approved database. 
Follow-up included routine cranial MRI surveillance with further imaging as 
clinically indicated. LM relapse was determined by MRI findings and/or 
cerebrospinal fluid analysis. The chi-square test of independence was used to 
evaluate clinico-pathologic factors associated with increased risk of subsequent 
LM relapse. Median survival post-LM relapse was calculated using Kaplan-Meier 
technique.
RESULTS: Four-hundred-and-seven patients were eligible, with median follow-up of 
60 months for surviving patients. Eleven (2.7%) had LM at first relapse and in 
total 21 (5.1%) experienced LM in the entire follow-up period. Sites of LM 
relapse were 8 (38%) focal spinal, 2 (10%) focal brainstem medulla and 11 (52%) 
diffuse spinal. Median overall survival from initial diagnosis for the entire 
cohort was 17.6 months (95% CI 16.7-19.0). Median survival from LM relapse to 
death was 39 days (95% CI: 19-107). Factors associated with LM relapse were age 
less than 50 years (p < 0.01), initial disease located in the temporal lobe 
(p < 0.01) and tumours lacking MGMT promoter methylation (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: LM relapse is an uncommon but not rare event in patients managed 
radically for glioblastoma. It is associated with poor outcome with the majority 
of patients deceased within two months of recognition.
