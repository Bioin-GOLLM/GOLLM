BACKGROUND: Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN3 disease) is a 
hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disease well documented among 
Caucasians, but such clinical data and genetic characterization is lacking among 
Asian populations.
PATIENT AND METHODS: A 13-year-old Chinese girl presented for diagnostic 
evaluation with retinitis pigmentosa, generalised tonic-clonic seizure and 
cerebellar ataxia. Electron microscopy of whole blood and skin biopsy, and 
mutation analysis of CLN3 gene with genomic DNA and cDNA, were performed.
RESULTS: Electron microscopy showed vacuolated lymphocytes, and characteristic 
patterns in eccrine glands suggestive of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. 
Sequencing of genomic DNA showed homozygous splice site variant 
NM_000086.2(CLN3):c.906+6T>G, and the pathogenicity of which was confirmed by 
cDNA sequencing to demonstrate the deletion of a transmembrane domain of the 
CLN3 protein. The mutant protein was predicted to adversely affect ligand 
binding of CLN3 as a lysosomal membrane protein.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the first genetically confirmed CLN3 disease in 
Chinese, with a novel splice site variant with proposed pathogenetic mechanism 
relating gene and protein, and highlights the potential ethnic differences in 
the mutation spectrum. We wish to establish the importance of clinical awareness 
and laboratory diagnosis of CLN3 disease, especially in the promising age of 
gene therapy.
