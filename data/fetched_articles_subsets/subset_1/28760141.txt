BACKGROUND: Due to the limited safety data available at the time that a new 
medication is first marketed, it is essential to continue the collection and 
monitoring of safety data about adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during the 
medication's life cycle. This activity, known as pharmacovigilance (PV), is 
performed worldwide by the pharmaceutical industry as well as by regulatory 
agencies. In 2012, the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) established a 
Pharmacovigilance and Drug Information Department. The Department is tasked with 
identifying, monitoring, and initiating activities aimed at minimizing risks 
associated with medication utilization. To enable this, the MOH has devised 
procedures for PV and promoted extensive legislation in this area that require 
marketing authorization holders (MAHs) and medical institutions in Israel to 
report ADRs and new safety information to the MOH. A computerized database was 
created to support the reporting process. The objective of this article is to 
characterize the PV tools and activities implemented in Israel.
METHODS: Since September 2014, The Israeli Pharmacovigilance and Drug 
Information Department receives ICSRs at a central computerized database 
developed for this purpose. The data were analyzed by Department personnel and 
ICSRs were characterized according to their seriousness, source, categories of 
drugs involved, and the reporting format. Additionally, the Department reviewed 
signals detected from ADR reports and from other sources and assessed the 
resulting regulatory actions.
RESULTS: An analysis of the Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) submitted to 
the MOH's ADRs central database reveals that during the review period, a total 
of 16,409 ICSRs were received by the Department and 850 signals were identified, 
resulting in the following PV activities: inquiry and enhanced follow-up (430, 
50.6%), prescriber's and patient's leaflets updates (204, 24%), recall of 
products/batches (6, 0.7%), alerts for health care professionals (63, 7.4%). 
Eighty five (10%) of the signals required a comprehensive investigation 
involving external specialist and 1 (0.1%) resulted in initiation of 
epidemiologic study. Additionally, in 2015 the Department incorporated 
comprehensive framework for risk minimization of marketed medicinal products, 
also known as risk management plans (RMPs).
CONCLUSIONS: As practiced by other health authorities, the Israeli MOH 
effectively implemented various PV tools to ensure the safety of the Israeli 
health consumer.
