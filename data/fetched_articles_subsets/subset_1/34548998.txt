The field of vascular anomalies (VA) has been subject to changes during the last 
few decades. The current classification of the International Society for the 
Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) offers a simple diagnostic structure. Hand 
surgeons commonly appear to have limited exposure to VA. Already recognized for 
more than 120 years, pyogenic granuloma (PG) is by far the most commonly 
described VA by different disciplines with accordingly diverse treatment 
strategies and theories behind it. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF), venous aneurysms 
(VAN), and venous malformations (VM) are, however, rare in hand surgery. With a 
compilation of four illustrative cases of posttraumatic entities such as AVF, 
VAN, VM, and PG, we would like to highlight possible daily exposure to VA in the 
general hand surgery practice. We discuss diagnostic and therapeutic options as 
well as the current literature with focus on posttraumatic VA.
