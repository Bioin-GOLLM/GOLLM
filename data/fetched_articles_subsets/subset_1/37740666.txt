The extracellular environment defines a physical boundary condition with which 
cells interact. However, to date, cell response to geometrical environmental 
cues is largely studied in static settings, which fails to capture the 
spatiotemporally varying cues cells receive in native tissues. Here, a 
photoresponsive spiropyran-based hydrogel is presented as a dynamic, 
cell-compatible, and reconfigurable substrate. Local stimulation with blue light 
(455 nm) alters hydrogel swelling, resulting in on-demand reversible 
micrometer-scale changes in surface topography within 15 min, allowing 
investigation into cell response to controlled geometry actuations. At short 
term (1 h after actuation), fibroblasts respond to multiple rounds of recurring 
topographical changes by reorganizing their nucleus and focal adhesions (FA). 
FAs form primarily at the dynamic regions of the hydrogel; however, this 
propensity is abolished when the topography is reconfigured from grooves to 
pits, demonstrating that topographical changes dynamically condition 
fibroblasts. Further, this dynamic conditioning is found to be associated with 
long-term (72 h) maintenance of focal adhesions and epigenetic modifications. 
Overall, this study offers a new approach to dissect the dynamic interplay 
between cells and their microenvironment and shines a new light on the cell's 
ability to adapt to topographical changes through FA-based mechanotransduction.
