Both JNK and LRRK2 are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we report 
a reasonably selective and potent kinase inhibitor (compound 6) that bound to 
both JNK and LRRK2 (a dual inhibitor). A bidentate-binding strategy that 
simultaneously utilized the ATP hinge binding and a unique protein surface site 
outside of the ATP pocket was applied to the design and identification of this 
kind of inhibitor. Compound 6 was a potent JNK3 and modest LRRK2 dual inhibitor 
with an enzyme IC50 value of 12 nM and 99 nM (LRRK2-G2019S), respectively. 
Compound 6 also exhibited good cell potency, inhibited LRRK2:G2019S-induced 
mitochondrial dysfunction in SHSY5Y cells, and was demonstrated to be reasonably 
selective against a panel of 116 kinases from representative kinase families. 
Design of such a probe molecule may help enable testing if dual JNK and LRRK2 
inhibitions have added or synergistic efficacy in protecting against 
neurodegeneration in PD.
