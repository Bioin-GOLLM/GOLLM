Hereditary spherocytosis is a congenital red blood cell disorder. Typical 
clinical manifestations include anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly, which overlap 
with the thalassemia phenotype. Therefore, in high prevalence thalassemia 
regions, hereditary spherocytosis cases are often misdiagnosed. Here, a case 
once diagnosed as thalassemia, based on preliminary clinical examinations, 
underwent genetic testing in our laboratory, where analysis of globin gene 
mutations proved negative. We conducted both clinical and genetic analyses on 
the patient and his family. We collected clinical data, performed erythrocyte 
membrane protein analysis by SDS-PAGE and sequenced the ANK1 gene. We also 
investigated pathogenic mechanisms through cDNA sequencing and literature 
studies. From patient clinical data, we diagnosed the patient with moderate to 
severe hereditary spherocytosis, rather than thalassemia. SDS-PAGE data showed 
that Ankyrin protein expression was reduced. Sequencing of genomic DNA 
identified a frameshift mutation (ANK1:c.2394_2397del CAGT). cDNA sequencing 
showed that the expression of a mutant allele was significantly decreased. Our 
study corrected a clinical misdiagnosis and confirmed the diagnosis of 
hereditary spherocytosis in this patient. Identification of such causative 
mutations is important for accurate downstream patient therapy and is critically 
important for the prevention/detection of another affected birth. Additionally, 
the disruption of mRNA transcribed from the mutant allele resulted in a 
significant reduction in Ankyrin expression and was speculatively considered the 
pathogenic mechanism behind this mutation.
