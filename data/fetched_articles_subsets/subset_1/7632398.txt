Overproduction of isoleucine, an essential amino acid, was achieved by 
amplification of the gene encoding threonine dehydratase, the first enzyme in 
the threonine to isoleucine pathway, in a Corynebacterium lactofermentum 
threonine producer. Threonine overproduction was previously achieved with C. 
lactofermentum ATCC 21799, a lysine-hyperproducing strain, by introduction of 
plasmid pGC42 containing the Corynebacterium homdr and thrB genes (encoding 
homoserine dehydrogenase and homoserine kinase respectively) under separate 
promoters. The pGC42 derivative, pGC77, also contains ilvA, which encodes 
threonine dehydratase. In a shake-flask fermentation, strain 21799(pGC77) 
produced 15 g/l isoleucine, along with small amounts of lysine and glycine. A 
molar carbon balance indicates that most of the carbon previously converted to 
threonine, lysine, glycine and isolecine was incorporated into isoleucine by the 
new strain. Thus, in our system, simple overexpression of wild-type ilvA 
sufficed to overcome the effects of feedback inhibition of threonine dehydratase 
by the end-product, isoleucine.
