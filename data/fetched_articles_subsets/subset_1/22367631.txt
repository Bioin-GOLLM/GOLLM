Migraine is a predominantly female disorder. Menarche, menstruation, pregnancy, 
and menopause, and also the use of hormonal contraceptives and hormone 
replacement treatment may influence migraine occurrence. Migraine usually starts 
after menarche, occurs more frequently in the days just before or during 
menstruation, and ameliorates during pregnancy and menopause. Those variations 
are mediated by fluctuation of estrogen levels through their influence on 
cellular excitability or cerebral vasculature. Moreover, administration of 
exogenous hormones may cause worsening of migraine as may expose migrainous 
women to an increased risk of vascular disease. In fact, migraine with aura 
represents a risk factor for stroke, cardiac disease, and vascular mortality. 
Studies have shown that administration of combined oral contraceptives to 
migraineurs may further increase the risk for ischemic stroke. Consequently, in 
women suffering from migraine with aura caution should be deserved when 
prescribing combined oral contraceptives.
