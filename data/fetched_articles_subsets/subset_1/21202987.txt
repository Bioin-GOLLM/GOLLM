Ethyl 4-(3-butyrylthio-ureido)benzoate.

Saeed S, Bhatti MH, Tahir MK, Jones PG.

The title compound, C(14)H(18)N(2)O(3)S, crystallizes in the thio-amide form 
with an intra-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen bond associated with the thio-urea unit. 
With the benzoic acid and the butyrylthio-ureido units, the mol-ecule consists 
of two planar building blocks connected by the common NH function adjacent to 
the aromatic ring. The inter-planar angle is 33.38 (3)°. Mol-ecules are 
connected in chains parallel to [110] by classical hydrogen bonds of the N-H⋯O 
type from the other NH group to the benzoate C=O of a neighboring mol-ecule.
