A halogen bond is a highly directional, non-covalent interaction between a 
halogen atom and another electronegative atom. It arises due to the formation of 
a small region of positive electrostatic potential opposite the covalent bond to 
the halogen, called the 'sigma hole.' Empirical force fields in which the 
electrostatic interactions are represented by atom-centered point charges cannot 
capture this effect because halogen atoms usually carry a negative charge and 
therefore interact unfavorably with other electronegative atoms. A strategy to 
overcome this problem is to attach a positively charged virtual particle to the 
halogen. In this work, we extend the additive CHARMM General Force Field 
(CGenFF) to include such interactions in model systems of phenyl-X, with X being 
Cl, Br or I including di- and trihalogenated species. The charges, Lennard-Jones 
parameters, and halogen-virtual particle distances were optimized to reproduce 
the orientation dependence of quantum mechanical interaction energies with 
water, acetone, and N-methylacetamide as well as experimental pure liquid 
properties and relative hydration free energies with respect to benzene. The 
resulting parameters were validated in molecular dynamics simulations on 
small-molecule crystals and on solvated protein-ligand complexes containing 
halogenated compounds. The inclusion of positive virtual sites leads to better 
agreement across experimental observables, including preservation of ligand 
binding poses as a direct result of the improved representation of halogen 
bonding.
