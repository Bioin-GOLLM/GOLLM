(5E)-2-[4,5-Bis(methyl-sulfan-yl)-1,3-dithiol-2-yl-idene]-5-(4-iodo-1,3-dithiol-2-yl-idene)-1,3-dithio-lan-4-one.

The mol-ecular framework of the title compound, C(11)H(7)IOS(8), is almost 
planar [maximum deviation = 0.040 (4) Å], except for the two methyl-sulfanyl 
groups, which are twisted relative to the mol-ecular skeleton, making C-S-C-C 
torsion angles of 144.1 (8) and -141.3 (8)°. In the crystal, mol-ecules are 
stacked alternately in opposite orientations, forming a one-dimensional column 
parallel to [110]. The primary inter-actions between mol-ecules comprising the 
columns are of the S⋯S type [3.554 (1) Å]. Inter-actions between columns are of 
the S⋯S type [3.411 (1) along b and 3.444 (1) Å along c], as well as S⋯I 
contacts [3.435 (2) Å].
