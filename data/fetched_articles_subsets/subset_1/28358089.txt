Molecular recognition, binding and catalysis are often mediated by non-covalent 
interactions involving aromatic functional groups. Although the relative 
complexity of these so-called π interactions has made them challenging to study, 
theory and modelling have now reached the stage at which we can explain their 
physical origins and obtain reliable insight into their effects on molecular 
binding and chemical transformations. This offers opportunities for the rational 
manipulation of these complex non-covalent interactions and their direct 
incorporation into the design of small-molecule catalysts and enzymes.
