BACKGROUND: Early life malnutrition is known to target adipose tissue with 
varying impact depending on timing of the insult. This study aimed to identify 
differentially expressed genes in subcutaneous (SUB) and perirenal (PER) adipose 
tissue of 2.5-years old sheep to elucidate the biology underlying differential 
impacts of late gestation versus early postnatal malnutrition on functional 
development of adipose tissues. Adipose tissues were obtained from 37 adult 
sheep born as twins to dams fed either NORM (fulfilling energy and protein 
requirements), LOW (50% of NORM) or HIGH (110% of protein and 150% of energy 
requirements) diets in the last 6-weeks of gestation. From day 3 to 6â€‰months of 
age, lambs were fed high-carbohydrate-high-fat (HCHF) or moderate low-fat (CONV) 
diets, and thereafter the same moderate low-fat diet.
RESULTS: The gene expression profile of SUB in the adult sheep was not affected 
by the pre- or early postnatal nutrition history. In PER, 993 and 186 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in LOW versus HIGH and 
NORM, respectively, but no DEG was found between HIGH and NORM. DEGs identified 
in the mismatched pre- and postnatal nutrition groups LOW-HCHF (101) and 
HIGH-HCHF (192) were largely downregulated compared to NORM-CONV. Out of 831 
DEGs, 595 and 236 were up- and downregulated in HCHF versus CONV, respectively. 
The functional enrichment analyses revealed that transmembrane (ion) transport 
activities, motor activities related to cytoskeletal and spermatozoa function 
(microtubules and the cytoskeletal motor protein, dynein), and responsiveness to 
the (micro) environmental extracellular conditions, including endocrine and 
nervous stimuli were enriched in the DEGs of LOW versus HIGH and NORM. We 
confirmed that mismatched pre- and postnatal feeding was associated with 
long-term programming of adipose tissue remodeling and immunity-related 
pathways. In agreement with phenotypic measurements, early postnatal HCHF 
feeding targeted pathways involved in kidney cell differentiation, and 
mismatched LOW-HCHF sheep had specific impairments in cholesterol metabolism 
pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Both pre- and postnatal malnutrition differentially programmed 
(patho-) physiological pathways with implications for adipose functional 
development associated with metabolic dysfunctions, and PER was a major target.
