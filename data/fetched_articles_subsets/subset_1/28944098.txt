PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin required for the 
activation of several vitamin K-dependent proteins to confer functioning. A 
growing body of evidence supports that vitamin K has beneficial effects on bone 
and cardiovascular health. This review summarizes key evidence on vitamin K 
status as measured by circulating measures and cardiovascular outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Overall, observational studies indicate that low vitamin K 
status as measured by high dephosphorylated uncarboxylated matrix gla protein 
concentrations plays a potential role in cardiovascular disease development, 
particularly in high-risk and chronic kidney disease populations. Very few 
vitamin K intervention trials have been conducted with cardiovascular-related 
outcomes. A couple of intervention trials studied the effect of the combination 
of vitamin D + K supplementation, which might have synergistic effects compared 
to vitamin K supplementation alone.
SUMMARY: Assessing vitamin K status in prospective studies and well-designed 
randomized trials would provide important insight whether vitamin K is causally 
related to vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease.
