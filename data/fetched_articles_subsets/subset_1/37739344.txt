The fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) is a multifunctional 
RNA-binding protein implicated in human neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative 
disorders. FMRP mediates the localization and activity-dependent translation of 
its associated mRNAs through the formation of phase-separated condensates that 
are trafficked by microtubule-based motors in axons. Axonal transport and 
localized mRNA translation are critical processes for long-term neuronal 
survival and are closely linked to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. 
FMRP dynein-mediated axonal trafficking is still largely unexplored but likely 
to constitute a key process underlying FMRP spatiotemporal translational 
regulation. Here, we show that dynein light chain roadblock 1 (Dynlrb1), a 
subunit of the dynein complex, is a critical regulator of FMRP function. In 
sensory axons, FMRP associates with endolysosomal organelles, likely through 
annexin A11, and is retrogradely trafficked by the dynein complex in a 
Dynlrb1-dependent manner. Moreover, Dynlrb1 silencing induced FMRP granule 
accumulation and repressed the translation of microtubule-associated protein 1b, 
one of its primary mRNA targets. Our findings suggest that Dynlrb1 regulates 
FMRP function through the control of its transport and targeted degradation.
