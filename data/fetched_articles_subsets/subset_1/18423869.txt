OBJECTIVE: To determine if CFH and LOC387715/ARMS2 genotypes influence treatment 
response to AREDS-type nutritional supplementation with antioxidants and zinc.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of participants in a randomized, controlled 
clinical trial, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS).
PARTICIPANTS AND/OR CONTROLS: Eight hundred seventy-six AREDS study participants 
who were considered at high risk for developing advanced age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD).
METHODS: Using DNA extracted from venous blood of 876 white participants in 
AREDS categories 3 and 4, that is, those considered to be at high risk for 
progression to advanced AMD, the authors genotyped for the single nucleotide 
polymorphisms in the CFH (Y402H, rs1061170) and LOC387715/ARMS2 (A69S, 
rs10490924) genes. The authors performed adjusted unconditional logistic 
regression analysis and assessed interactions of these genotypes to determine 
the relationship between CFH and LOC387715/ARMS2 genotype and treatment with 
antioxidants plus zinc.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interaction between genetic variants and treatment 
response as determined by progression from high-risk to advanced AMD.
RESULTS: Progression occurred in 264 of 876 patients from AREDS category 3 
(intermediate AMD) to category 4 or 5 (unilateral or bilateral advanced AMD, 
respectively), or from category 4 to category 5. A treatment interaction was 
observed between the CFH Y402H genotype and supplementation with antioxidants 
plus zinc (CC; P = 0.03). An interaction (P = 0.004) was observed in the AREDS 
treatment groups taking zinc when compared with the groups taking no zinc, but 
not in groups taking antioxidants compared with those taking no antioxidants (P 
= 0.59). There were no significant treatment interactions observed with 
LOC387715/ARMS2.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that an individual's response 
to AREDS supplements may be related to CFH genotype. This could have clinical 
relevance by predicting treatment outcome and potentially preventing unwanted 
side effects in those who may not benefit. Corroboration of these analyses is 
needed before considering modification of current management. This is among the 
first pharmacogenetic studies to suggest interaction between genotype and 
treatment.
