Cathepsin K is known to play an important role in bone resorption, and it has 
the P2 specificity for proline. Rat cathepsin K has 88% identity with the human 
enzyme. However, it has been reported that its enzymatic activity for a 
Cbz-Leu-Arg-MCA substrate is lower than that of human cathepsin K, and that the 
rat enzyme is not well inhibited by human cathepsin K inhibitors. For this 
study, we prepared recombinant enzyme to investigate the substrate specificity 
of rat cathepsin K. Cleavage experiments using the fragment of type I collagen 
and peptidic libraries demonstrated that rat cathepsin K preferentially 
hydrolyses the substrates at the P2 Hyp position. Comparison of the S2 site 
between rat and human cathepsin K sequences indicated that two S2 residues at 
Ser134 and Val160 in rat are varied to Ala and Leu, respectively, in the human 
enzyme. Cleavage experiments using two single mutants, S134A and V160L, and one 
double mutant, S134A/V160L, of rat cathepsin K showed that all the rat mutants 
lost the P2 Hyp specificity. The information obtained from our comparative 
studies on rat and human cathepsin K should make a significant impact on 
developing specific inhibitors of human cathepsin K since rat is usually used as 
test species.
