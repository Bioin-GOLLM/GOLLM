Pheochromocytoma is very rare at a pediatric age, and when it is present, the 
probability of a causative genetic mutation is high. Due to high costs of 
genetic surveys and an increasing number of genes associated with 
pheochromocytoma, a sequential genetic analysis driven by clinical and 
biochemical phenotypes is advised. The published literature regarding the 
genetic landscape of pediatric pheochromocytoma is scarce, which may hinder the 
establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations and the selection of 
appropriate genetic testing at this population. In the present review, we focus 
on the clinical phenotypes of pediatric patients with pheochromocytoma in an 
attempt to contribute to an optimized genetic testing in this clinical context. 
We describe epidemiological data on the prevalence of pheochromocytoma 
susceptibility genes, including new genes that are expanding the genetic 
etiology of this neuroendocrine tumor in pediatric patients. The clinical 
phenotypes associated with a higher pretest probability for hereditary 
pheochromocytoma are presented, focusing on differences between pediatric and 
adult patients. We also describe new syndromes, as well as rates of malignancy 
and multifocal disease associated with these syndromes and pheochromocytoma 
susceptibility genes published more recently. Finally, we discuss new tools for 
genetic screening of patients with pheochromocytoma, with an emphasis on its 
applicability in a pediatric population.
