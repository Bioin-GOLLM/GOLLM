The IgA isotype of human antibodies triggers inflammatory responses via the 
IgA-specific receptor FcalphaRI (CD89). Structural studies have suggested that 
IgA1 N-glycans could modulate the interaction with FcalphaRI. We have carried 
out detailed biophysical analyses of three IgA1 samples purified from human 
serum and recombinant IgA1-Fc and compared their binding to FcalphaRI. 
Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed wide variation in the distribution of 
polymeric species between IgA1 samples, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron 
resonance mass spectrometry showed overlapping but distinct populations of 
N-glycan species between IgA1 samples. Kinetic and equilibrium data from surface 
plasmon resonance experiments revealed that variation in the IgA1 C H2 N-glycans 
had no effect on the kinetics or affinity constants for binding to FcalphaRI. 
Indeed, complete enzymatic removal of the IgA1 N-glycans yielded superimposable 
binding curves. These findings have implications for renal diseases such as IgA 
nephropathy.
