Many enzymes operate through half-of-the sites reactivity wherein a single 
protomer is catalytically engaged at one time. In the case of the homodimeric 
enzyme, fluoroacetate dehalogenase, substrate binding triggers closing of a 
regulatory cap domain in the empty protomer, preventing substrate access to the 
remaining active site. However, the empty protomer serves a critical role by 
acquiring more disorder upon substrate binding, thereby entropically favoring 
the forward reaction. Empty protomer dynamics are also allosterically coupled to 
the bound protomer, driving conformational exchange at the active site and 
progress along the reaction coordinate. Here, we show that at high 
concentrations, a second substrate binds along the substrate-access channel of 
the occupied protomer, thereby dampening interprotomer dynamics and inhibiting 
catalysis. While a mutation (K152I) abrogates second site binding and removes 
inhibitory effects, it also precipitously lowers the maximum catalytic rate, 
implying a role for the allosteric pocket at low substrate concentrations, where 
only a single substrate engages the enzyme at one time. We show that this outer 
pocket first desolvates the substrate, whereupon it is deposited in the active 
site. Substrate binding to the active site then triggers the empty outer pocket 
to serve as an interprotomer allosteric conduit, enabling enhanced dynamics and 
sampling of activation states needed for catalysis. These allosteric networks 
and the ensuing changes resulting from second substrate binding are delineated 
using rigidity-based allosteric transmission theory and validated by nuclear 
magnetic resonance and functional studies. The results illustrate the role of 
dynamics along allosteric networks in facilitating function.
