Over the past few years, significant advances have occurred in both our 
understanding of the complexity of signal transduction pathways as well as the 
isolation of specific inhibitors which target key components in those pathways. 
Furthermore critical information is being accrued regarding how genetic 
mutations can affect the sensitivity of various types of patients to targeted 
therapy. Finally, genetic mechanisms responsible for the development of 
resistance after targeted therapy are being discovered which may allow the 
creation of alternative therapies to overcome resistance. This review will 
discuss some of the highlights over the past few years on the roles of key 
signaling pathways in various diseases, the targeting of signal transduction 
pathways and the genetic mechanisms governing sensitivity and resistance to 
targeted therapies.
