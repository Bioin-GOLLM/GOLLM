BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy, safety and 
pharmacokinetics of 750 mg telaprevir (TVR) given at 8 or 12 h intervals during 
triple therapy with pegylated interferon-α2b (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) for 
patients with chronic HCV infection.
METHODS: A total of 52 patients with high viral loads of HCV genotype 1b who 
were expected to respond well to therapy (rs8099917 TT genotype or relapse to 
previous therapy) were randomly assigned to two groups who were given 750 mg TVR 
at either 8 h (q8h) or 12 h (q12h) intervals in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV 
for 12 weeks, followed by 12 additional weeks of treatment with PEG-IFN and RBV 
alone. The primary end point of the study was undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks 
after the end of treatment (sustained virological response [SVR]12).
RESULTS: SVR12 rates were 92.3% (24/26) for both q8h and q12h. The changes in 
mean log10 HCV RNA levels and viral response were also similar in q8h compared 
to q12h, whereas pharmacokinetic properties such as maximum plasma 
concentration, area under the concentration-time curve at 24 h and trough plasma 
concentration of TVR were slightly higher in q8h than in q12h (P>0.2). The 
frequency of TVR discontinuation due to anaemia or renal damage was 
significantly higher in q12h than in q8h (6/26 [23%] versus 0/20 [0%], 
respectively; P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: TVR given at 12 h intervals should be considered for patients with 
lower body weight, especially patients with prior relapse and with IL28B 
polymorphisms at rs8099917 TT (interferon-λ 4 ss469415590 polymorphism TT/TT) 
genotype in patients with genotype 1b HCV infection.
