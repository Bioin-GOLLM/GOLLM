Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an immunodeficiency caused by defects in 
the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase complex and is 
usually diagnosed in early childhood. CGD patients suffer from severe, recurrent 
infections with bacteria, fungi and yeasts. We report a 25-year-old female with 
protracted fever because of a Staphylococcus aureus liver abscess, which did not 
resolve until breakthrough into the stomach. Despite her age, CGD was considered 
on diagnosis on the basis of the clinical symptoms. Analysis of the 
NADPH-oxidase activity confirmed CGD as the underlying condition. Western 
blotting revealed the absence of p47(phox) and subsequent sequencing of the 
p47(phox)-encoding gene, neutrophil cytosolic factor (NCF1), identified a 
deletion of 837C in the maternal NCF1 allele. The paternal allele contained a 
stopcodon because of a conversion between NCF1 and one of its PsiNCF1 
pseudogenes. The patient had one novel mutation, c.837delC, and one conversion 
in NCF1, resulting in the complete absence of the p47(phox) component of the 
NADPH-oxidase complex. This p47(phox)-deficient CGD patient had the highest age 
at diagnosis reported thus far.
