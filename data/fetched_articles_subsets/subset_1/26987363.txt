Membrane fusion is mediated by the SNARE complex which is formed through a 
zippering process. Here, we developed a chemical controller for the progress of 
membrane fusion. A hemifusion state was arrested by a polyphenol myricetin which 
binds to the SNARE complex. The arrest of membrane fusion was rescued by an 
enzyme laccase that removes myricetin from the SNARE complex. The rescued 
hemifusion state was metastable and long-lived with a decay constant of 39 min. 
This membrane fusion controller was applied to delineate how Ca(2+) stimulates 
fusion-pore formation in a millisecond time scale. We found, using a 
single-vesicle fusion assay, that such myricetin-primed vesicles with 
synaptotagmin 1 respond synchronously to physiological concentrations of Ca(2+). 
When 10 Î¼M Ca(2+) was added to the hemifused vesicles, the majority of vesicles 
rapidly advanced to fusion pores with a time constant of 16.2 ms. Thus, the 
results demonstrate that a minimal exocytotic membrane fusion machinery composed 
of SNAREs and synaptotagmin 1 is capable of driving membrane fusion in a 
millisecond time scale when a proper vesicle priming is established. The 
chemical controller of SNARE-driven membrane fusion should serve as a versatile 
tool for investigating the differential roles of various synaptic proteins in 
discrete fusion steps.
