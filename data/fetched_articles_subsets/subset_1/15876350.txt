BACKGROUND: Amplifications at 6p22.3 are prevalent in advanced stage bladder 
cancer (TCC). Previous studies have identified SOX4, CDKAL, and E2F3 as targets 
of this amplification and therefore potential oncogenes, but the more telomeric 
DEK gene too has been reported as overexpressed and amplified. We have therefore 
investigated whether the intermediate region harboring the oncogene candidate 
ID4 is also part of the amplicon.
RESULTS: Expression of E2F3, DEK, and ID4 was investigated by real-time RT-PCR 
in 28 TCC compared to 6 normal bladder tissues and in 15 TCC cell lines compared 
to cultured normal urothelial cells. Expression of E2F3 as well as DEK increased 
on average in tumor vs. normal tissues (3-fold and 2.5-fold, resp.), but only 
the increase for E2F3 was statistically significant (p = 0.039). ID4 
overexpression was observed in selected specimens. Each of the three genes was 
overexpressed in several cell lines, up to 150-fold (ID4), 30-fold (E2F3), and 
9-fold (DEK), but these increases were not correlated to each other. Instead, 
moderate (DEK) to excellent (ID4) correlations were observed with copy number 
increases of microsatellites near each gene. Microsatellite copy number 
increases were highly heterogeneous across the investigated several Mb region 
revealing at least three subregions of amplification.
CONCLUSION: Extending previous reports, our data indicate that the 6p22.3 
amplicon in TCC is highly heterogeneous and targets several genes in a variable 
fashion. Among these, expression of E2F3 and DEK appear to be generally 
increased in TCC, with additional increases caused by amplifications. In 
contrast, over-expression of ID4, which is normally predominantly expressed in 
testes and brain, appears to depend more strictly on gene amplification. 
Accordingly, the effect of amplifications at 6p22.3 in bladder cancer is 
expected to be non-uniform, thereby contributing to the highly variable 
biological and clinical behavior of advanced stage tumors. ID4 is a potential 
oncogene in a small subset of bladder cancers.
