The Notch signaling pathway is a crucial regulator of cell differentiation as 
well as tissue organization, whose deregulation is linked to the pathogenesis of 
different diseases. NOTCH1 plays a key role in breast cancer progression by 
increasing proliferation, maintenance of cancer stem cells, and impairment of 
cell death. NOTCH1 is a mechanosensitive receptor, where mechanical force is 
required to activate the proteolytic cleavage and release of the Notch 
intracellular domain (NICD). We circumvent this limitation by regulating Notch 
activity by light. To achieve this, we have engineered an optogenetic NOTCH1 
receptor (optoNotch) to control the activation of NOTCH1 intracellular domain 
(N1ICD) and its downstream transcriptional activities. Using optoNotch we 
confirm that NOTCH1 activation increases cell proliferation in MCF7 and 
MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in 2D and spheroid 3D cultures, although causing 
distinct cell-type specific migratory phenotypes. Additionally, optoNotch 
activation induced chemoresistance on the same cell lines. OptoNotch allows the 
fine-tuning, ligand-independent, regulation of N1ICD activity and thus a better 
understanding of the spatiotemporal complexity of Notch signaling. Video
