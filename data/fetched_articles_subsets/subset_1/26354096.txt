PURPOSE: Idiopathic asthenospermia is the most common type of male infertility. 
Although the mechanisms causing asthenospermia are complex, recent studies have 
indicated an important role of cation channel of sperm (CATSPER) gene 
downregulation or abnormality in the etiology of idiopathic asthenospermia.
METHODS: In the present study, 192 patients with idiopathic asthenospermia and 
288 healthy controls were enrolled, and a flight mass spectrometry using 
Sequenom's MassArray biochip system was applied for genotyping 16 CATSPER gene 
SNPs reported in the human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database.
RESULTS: Our results indicated a correlation between CATSPER1 SNPs and 
idiopathic asthenospermia. In particular, the exonal SNP rs1893316 in CATSPER1 
significantly correlated with idiopathic asthenospermia risk and is a potential 
important factor in determining an individual's genetic susceptibility to 
idiopathic asthenospermia.
CONCLUSION: These finding will help to further elucidate the role of CATSPER1 in 
idiopathic asthenospermia pathogenesis.
