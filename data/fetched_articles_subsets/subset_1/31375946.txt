Cigarette smoking is directly associated with lung cancer. Non-small cell lung 
carcinoma (NSCLC) represents approximately 80% from all types of lung cancer. 
This latter is hard to diagnose and to treat due to the lack of symptoms in 
early stages of the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate ADA activity 
and the expression of P2X7, A1, and A2A receptors and in lymphocytes. In 
addition, the profile of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines serum 
levels of patients with lung cancer in advanced stage was evaluated. Patients 
(n = 13) previously treated for lung cancer at stage IV (UICC) with chemotherapy 
had their blood collected. Cancer patients showed a decrease in ADA activity and 
an increase in A1 receptor expression in lymphocytes when compared to the 
control group. Moreover, patients exhibited an increase in IL-6 and TNF-α, while 
IL-17 and INF-ϒ serum levels were lower in patients with lung cancer. The 
decreased ADA activity and the increase in A1 receptor expression may contribute 
to adenosine pro-tumor effects by increasing IL-6 and TNF-α and decreasing IL-17 
and INF-γ serum levels. Our data show an indirect evidence that purinergic 
signaling may have a role in promoting a profile of cytokines levels that favors 
tumor progression.
