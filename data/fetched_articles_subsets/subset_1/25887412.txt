BACKGROUND: Analysis of large-scale omics data has become more and more 
challenging due to high dimensionality. More complex analysis methods and tools 
are required to handle such data. While many methods already exist, those 
methods often produce different results. To help users obtain more appropriate 
results (i.e. candidate genes), we propose a tool, GRACOMICS that compares 
numerous analysis results visually in a more systematic way; this enables the 
users to easily interpret the results more comfortably.
RESULTS: GRACOMICS has the ability to visualize multiple analysis results 
interactively. We developed GRACOMICS to provide instantaneous results (plots 
and tables), corresponding to user-defined threshold values, since there are yet 
no other up-to-date omics data visualization tools that provide such features. 
In our analysis, we successfully employed two types of omics data: 
transcriptomic data (microarray and RNA-seq data) and genomic data (SNP chip and 
NGS data).
CONCLUSIONS: GRACOMICS is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based program written 
in Java for cross-platform computing environments, and can be applied to compare 
analysis results for any type of large-scale omics data. This tool can be useful 
for biologists to identify genes commonly found by intersected statistical 
methods, for further experimental validation.
