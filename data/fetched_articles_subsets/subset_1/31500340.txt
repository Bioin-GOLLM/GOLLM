Lettuce is often implicated in human norovirus (HuNoV) foodborne outbreaks. We 
identified H-like histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) on lettuce leaves as 
specific binding moieties for virus-like particles (VLPs) of HuNoV 
GII.4/HS194/2009 strain. The objective of this study was to determine whether 
HuNoV-lettuce binding is mediated through the virus HBGA binding sites (HBS). 
Toward this objective, VLPs of historical HuNoV GII.4 strains (1987, 1997, 2002, 
2004 and 2006) with known natural mutations in their HBS, two newly generated 
VLP mutants of GII.4/HS194/2009 (D374A and G443A) and a VLP mutant (W375A) of 
GI.1/Norwalk/1968 along with its wild type VLPs, which displays distinct HBS, 
were investigated for their binding to lettuce. ELISA revealed that historical 
GII.4 strains binding to lettuce was dependent on their HBGAs profiles. The VLP 
mutants D374A and G443A lost binding to HBGAs and displayed no to minimal 
binding to lettuce, respectively. The VLPs of GI.1/Norwalk/1968 strain bound to 
lettuce through an H-like HBGA and the binding was inhibited by fucosidase 
digestion. Mutant W375A which was previously shown not to bind to HBGAs, 
displayed significantly reduced binding to lettuce. We conclude that the binding 
of HuNoV GII.4 and GI.1 strains to lettuce is mediated through the virus HBS.
