Chronic granulomatous disease is a rare inherited disorder caused by nonexistent 
or severely decreased phagocyte superoxide production that results in a severe 
defect in host defense and consequent predisposition to microbial infection. The 
enzyme responsible for generating the superoxide, NADPH oxidase, involves at 
least 5 protein components. The absence of, or a defect in, any 1 of 4 of these 
proteins (p22(phox), p47(phox), p67(phox), or gp91(phox)) gives rise to the 
known types of chronic granulomatous disease. One of the rarest forms of the 
disease is due to defects in the CYBA gene encoding p22(phox), which together 
with gp91(phox) forms flavocytochrome b(558), the catalytic core of NADPH 
oxidase. To date, only 9 kindreds with p22(phox) deficiency have been described 
in the literature comprising 10 mutant alleles. Four polymorphisms in the CYBA 
gene have also been reported. Here we describe 9 new, unrelated kindreds 
containing 12 mutations, 9 of which are novel. In addition, we report 3 new 
polymorphisms. The novel mutations are (a) deletion of exons 2 and 3, (b) a 
missense mutation in exon 3 (T155-->C), (c) a splice site mutation at the 5' end 
of intron 3, (d) a missense mutation in exon 2 (G74-->T), (e) a nonsense 
mutation in exon 1 (G26-->A), (f) a missense mutation in exon 4 (C268-->T), (g) 
a frameshift in exon 3 due to the insertion of C at C162, (h) a nonsense 
mutation in exon 2 (G107-->A), and (i) a missense mutation in exon 2 (G70-->A).
