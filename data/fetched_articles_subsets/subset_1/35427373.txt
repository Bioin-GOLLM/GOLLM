Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks the third in cancers and the second in the reasons 
of cancer-related death. More evidence indicates that long non-coding RNA 
participates in tumor initiation and progression. It's known that cancer 
susceptibility candidate 9 is an oncogenic long non-coding RNA in CRC. 
miR-542-3p is a negative regulator of CRC, while integrin-linked kinase could 
contribute to tumor progression and chemoresistance. However, the correlation 
among long non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9, miR-542-3p and 
integrin-linked kinase in CRC is still unclear. We demonstrated long non-coding 
RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 in CRC specimens and cell lines 
overexpressed via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Once long 
non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 was knocked down, it 
significantly inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of CRC cells in 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, cell counting kit-8, 
5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, and transwell assays, which also was validated in 
vivo. Long non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 negatively regulates 
miR-542-3p in a targeted manner, and the function of up-regulated miR-542-3p was 
confirmed similarly. While miR-542-3p negatively regulates integrin-linked 
kinase. Thus, we further verified that overexpression of integrin-linked kinase 
on down-regulated long non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 or 
up-regulated miR-542-3p significantly restored CRC cell proliferation via 
bioinformatic analysis, dual-luciferase report assay, real-time quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction, RNA immunoprecipitation, and western blot. This study 
testified that silencing long non-coding RNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 
could inhibit proliferation and invasion of CRC cells by 
miR-542-3p/integrin-linked kinase.
