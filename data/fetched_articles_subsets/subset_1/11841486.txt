The gene for tumour necrosis factor (TNF) lies at the telomeric end of the class 
III region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Polymorphisms within 
this gene have been implicated in the genetic background of a large number of 
common human diseases. Recently two polymorphisms, TNF +489 and +691, have been 
described in the first intron of TNF (+489, G to A transition; +691, G deletion) 
and disease associations have been reported; however, the pattern of linkage 
disequilibrium with other MHC alleles has not been studied. We have therefore 
studied the association of TNF alleles with HLA-DR, -DQ and -B alleles in 216 
healthy individuals from the north of England. The frequencies of the uncommon 
alleles were 0.08 (+489A) and 0.05 (+691Gdel). The +489A allele is associated 
with carriage of DRB1*1104, DQB1*0301, B18 and B35. The +691Gdel allele is 
associated with carriage of DRB1*13 *11, DQB1*0301 and B44. Knowledge of the 
pattern of association, indicating probable linkage disequilibrium, between 
these TNF alleles may be useful in studies aimed at determining the role of this 
locus in the genetic background of the large number of diseases which show 
genetic associations with MHC haplotypes.
