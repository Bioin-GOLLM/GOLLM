BACKGROUND: As observed in recent genetic studies, PITX2 is one of the most 
popular genes with atrial fibrillation; single nucleotide polymorphism 
(rs2200733) at chromosome 4q25 (near PITX2) is found to be strongly associated 
with atrial fibrillation, but it has a difference among Chinese Han population. 
The basic aim of conducting this study is to find the correlation between PITX2 
gene polymorphism and the risk of atrial fibrillation and to identify the 
possibility for early diagnosis of silent atrial fibrillation and high-risk 
atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: The study included 98 cases of atrial fibrillation patients and 88 
non-atrial fibrillation patients in Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University 
were enrolled in a case-control study. The single nucleotide polymorphism of 
rs2200733 at 4q25 near PITX2 was genotyped by polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 98 patients with atrial fibrillation were genotyped, and the 
following frequencies were included in genotype percentages (44.9%, 50%, and 
5.1%) while distribution of significant single nucleotide polymorphism rs2200733 
consisted (29.55%, 53.41%, and 17.05%) which showed (χ2 = 9.159, P =.01). There 
was no significant difference in TC genotype frequency (P =.642), frequency of T 
allele (χ2 = 7.447, P =.006), and T allele was 1.806 times that of the control 
group (odds ratio = 1.806, 95% CI = 1.179-2.766, P =.006). According to logistic 
regression analysis, following results were concluded for TC genotype (odds 
ratio = 3.128, 95% CI = 1.053-9.287, P =.04), or TT genotype (odds ratio = 
5.077, 95% CI = 1.653-15.595, P =.005) increased the risk of atrial 
fibrillation.
CONCLUSIONS: The genotype and allele frequency distribution of rs2200733 (T/C) 
near PITX2 is different in the atrial fibrillation group and the control group. 
The T allele is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Compared with the CC 
genotype, the TT genotype increased the risk of atrial fibrillation.
