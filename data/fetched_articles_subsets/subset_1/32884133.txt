PURPOSE: Vascular malformations (VM) are primarily caused by somatic activating 
pathogenic variants in oncogenes. Targeted pharmacotherapies are emerging but 
require molecular diagnosis. Since variants are currently only detected in 
malformation tissue, patients may be ineligible for clinical trials prior to 
surgery. We hypothesized that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) could provide molecular 
diagnoses for patients with isolated VM.
METHODS: cfDNA was isolated from plasma or cyst fluid from patients with 
arteriovenous malformations (AVM), venous malformations (VeM), or lymphatic 
malformations (LM), and assayed for known pathogenic variants using droplet 
digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Cyst fluid cfDNA from an independent 
cohort of LM patients was prospectively screened for variants using a multiplex 
ddPCR assay.
RESULTS: Variants were detected in plasma cfDNA in patients with AVM (2/8) and 
VeM (1/3). Variants were detected in cyst fluid cfDNA (7/7) but not plasma 
(0/26) in LM patients. Prospective testing of cyst fluid cfDNA with multiplex 
ddPCR identified variants in LM patients who had never undergone surgery (4/5).
CONCLUSION: Variants were detected in plasma from AVM and VeM patients, and in 
cyst fluid from patients with LM. These data support investigation of 
cfDNA-based molecular diagnostics for VM patients, which may provide 
opportunities to initiate targeted pharmacotherapies without prior surgery.
