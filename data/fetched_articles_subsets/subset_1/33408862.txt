Dual antiplatelet therapy is a cornerstone treatment following percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Ticagrelor, a 
direct-acting potent P2Y12 inhibitor, is superior to clopidogrel in the acute 
setting of ACS: due to its faster onset and potent antiplatelet inhibition. 
Thus, ticagrelor is becoming widely recommended as the as the initial treatment 
following PCI in current guidelines. However, due to its potency, the risk of 
bleeding is higher. Herein, a report of an unusual case of spontaneous 
intermuscular hematoma is described. Furthermore, single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms that may be related to bleeding in ticagrelor using 
population-based genome-wide association studies were also identified and are 
discussed. As there is a concern that patients of Asian origin may have a higher 
risk of bleeding, physicians must be made aware of this risk when prescribing 
ticagrelor to individuals of Asian decent.
