The Cry1Ia12 entomotoxin from a Brazilian Bacillus thuringiensis strain is 
currently being expressed in cotton cultivars to confer resistance to 
insect-pests. The present study aimed to assess the effects of a diet containing 
Cry1Ia12 protein on growing rats. A test diet containing egg white and Cry1Ia12 
(0.1% of total protein) as a protein source was offered to rats for ten days. In 
addition, an acute toxicity bioassay was performed in rats with a single oral 
dose of the entomotoxin (12 mg/animal). No adverse effects were observed in the 
animals receiving the test diet when compared to those receiving a control diet 
(egg white). The analysed parameters included relative dry weight of internal 
organs, duodenum histology, blood biochemistry, and nutritional parameters. The 
results of the acute toxicity test showed no mortality or behaviour alteration. 
Thus, Cry1Ia12 toxin at the tested concentration does not cause deleterious 
effects on growing rats when incorporated in the diet for 10 days.
