Anti-retroviral drugs suppress HIV-1 plasma viremia to undetectable levels; 
however, latent HIV-1 persists in reservoirs within HIV-1-infected patients. The 
silent provirus can be activated through the use of drugs, including protein 
kinase C activators and histone deacetylase inhibitors. This "shock" approach is 
then followed by "kill" of the producing cells either through direct 
HIV-1-induced cell death or natural immune mechanisms. However, these mechanisms 
are relatively slow and effectiveness is unclear. Here, we develop an approach 
to specifically target and kill cells that are activated early in the process of 
virus production. We utilize a novel nanocapsule technology whereby the ricin A 
chain is encapsulated in an inactive form within a polymer shell. Specificity 
for release of the ricin A toxin is conferred by peptide crosslinkers that are 
sensitive to cleavage by HIV-1 protease. By using well-established latent 
infection models, J-Lat and U1 cells, we demonstrate that only within an 
HIV-1-producing cell expressing functional HIV-1 protease will the nanocapsule 
release its ricin A cargo, shutting down viral and cellular protein synthesis, 
and ultimately leading to rapid death of the producer cell. Thus, we provide 
proof of principle for a novel technology to kill HIV-1-producing cells without 
effects on non-target cells.
