OBJECTIVES: Although it does not alter the ERCC1 phenotype, the ERCC1 500C>T 
(rs11615) polymorphism has undergone a myriad of investigations into its role as 
a marker for nucleotide excision repair (NER) function in different races, 
diseases and treatment outcomes. The goal of our study was to test the 
hypothesis that 500C>T is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with causative alleles, 
and that these haplotypes are more frequent in Caucasians with melanoma than in 
healthy Caucasians or African Americans.
DESIGN: In this case-control study, we selected race-specific ERCC1 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), conducted LD analysis with ERCC1 500C>T 
and compared the frequency of ERCC1 diplotypes in Caucasians with melanoma 
(n=165), healthy Caucasians (n=150) and healthy African Americans (n=159). The 
haplotype was further studied using a fusion gene containing multiple ERCC1 
SNPs.
SETTING: Large cancer institute in the USA.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 165 Caucasian melanoma patients, 159 healthy Caucasian 
controls and 159 African American healthy controls. Men and women were enrolled 
in the clinical trial; however, since the screening trial included prostate 
cancer screening in addition to screening for other cancers, only male controls 
were available.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were melanoma risk in Caucasians, and LD 
between ERCC1 SNP, N118N and other race-specific allelic variants.
RESULTS: When compared to ERCC1 500C>T alone, a race-specific three-SNP variant 
haplotype in ERCC1 (comprised of rs11615, rs3212950 and rs3212948) was even more 
frequent in Caucasians with melanoma than in healthy Caucasians (p=0.0034) or 
African Americans (p<0.0001). A plasmid containing the variant haplotype was not 
differentially expressed.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that ERCC1 500C>T participates in a previously 
characterised cancer-risk haplotype found more frequently in Caucasians, while 
LD is weak in African Americans; this haplotype appears to also be related to 
melanoma. It is therefore likely that ERCC1 500C>T is only a valid NER, disease 
or treatment outcome marker in Caucasians.
