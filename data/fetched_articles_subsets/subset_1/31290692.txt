Aim: To assess the efficacy and safety of alternative fotemustine administration 
schedule in elderly patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Patients & methods: 
Patients aged >65 years with recurrent glioblastoma received fotemustine 
(80 mg/m2; days 1, 15, 30, 45 and 60, and subsequently every 4 weeks). Primary 
end point was progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months. Main secondary 
end point was safety. Results: 58 patients were enrolled at two centers. PFS at 
6 months was 47% (27 patients) and overall response rate was 29%. Median PFS and 
survival were 6 and 7 months, respectively, and longer in responders versus 
nonresponders. No grade 3-4 hematological toxicities occurred. Conclusion: The 
alternative fotemustine administration schedule was an effective and safe 
treatment for recurrent glioblastoma in elderly patients.
