BACKGROUND: Male factor is the major contributor in roughly half of infertility 
cases. Genetic factors account for 10-15% of male infertility. Microdeletions of 
azoospermia factors (AZF) on the Yq region are the second most frequent 
spermatogenesis disorder among infertile men after Klinefelter syndrome. We 
detected in our previous study a frequency of 37.5% AZF microdeletions which 
investigated mainly the AZFb and AZFc. We attempted in this study for the first 
time to evaluate the frequencies of all AZF sub-regions microdeletions and to 
analyze reproductive hormonal profiles in idiopathic cases of azoospermic and 
oligozoospermic men from Sudan.
METHODS: A group of 51 medically fit infertile men were subjected to semen 
analysis. Four couples have participated in this study as a control group. Semen 
analysis was performed according to WHO criteria by professionals at Elsir 
Abu-Elhassan Fertility Centre where samples have been collected. We detected 12 
STSs markers of Y chromosome AZF microdeletions using a multiplex polymerase 
chain reaction. Analysis of reproductive hormone levels including Follicle 
Stimulating, Luteinizing, and Prolactin hormones was performed using ELISA. 
Comparisons between outcome groups were performed using Student's t-test 
Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: AZF microdeletion was identified in 16 out of 25 Azoospermic and 14 out 
of 26 of the Oligozoospermic. Microdeletion in the AZFa region was the most 
frequent among the 30 patients (N = 11) followed by AZFc, AZFd (N = 4 for each) 
and AZFb (N = 3). Among the Oligozoospermic participants, the most frequent 
deletions detected were in the AZFa region (N = 10 out of 14) and was 
significantly associated with Oligozoospermic phenotype, Fisher's Exact Test 
(2-sided) p = 0.009. Among the Azoospermic patients, the deletion of the AZFc 
region was the most frequent (N = 9 out of 16) and was significantly associated 
with Azoospermia phenotype Fisher's Exact Test p = 0.026. There was a 
significant difference in Y chromosome microdeletion frequency between the two 
groups. The hormonal analysis showed that the mean levels of PRL, LH, and FSH in 
Azoospermic patients were slightly higher than those in oligozoospermic. A weak 
negative correlation between prolactin higher level and Azoospermic patients was 
detected. (AZFa r = 0.665 and 0.602, p = 0.000 and 0.0004, AZFb r = 0.636 and 
0.409, p = 0.000 and 0.025, and AZFd r = 0.398 and 0.442, p = 0.029 and 0.015). 
The correlation was positive for AZFa and negative for AZFb and AZFd.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded in this study that the incidences of microdeletions of 
the Y chromosome confined to AZF a, b, c and d regions is 58.8% in infertile 
subjects with 31.4% were Azoospermic and 27.5% were Oligozoospermic. This might 
provide a piece of evidence that these specified regions of the Y chromosome are 
essential for controlling spermatogenesis. These findings will be useful for 
genetic counseling within infertility clinics in Sudan and to adopt appropriate 
methods for assisted reproduction.
