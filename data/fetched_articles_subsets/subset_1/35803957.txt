SARS-CoV-2's papain-like protease (PLpro) interaction with ligands has recently 
been explored with a myriad of crystal structures. We used molecular dynamics 
(MD) simulations to study different PLpro-ligand complexes, their ligand-induced 
conformational changes, and interactions. We focused on inhibitors reported with 
known IC50 against PLpro, namely GRL-0617, XR8-89, PLP_Snyder530, and Sander's 
recently published compound 7 (CPD7), and compared these trajectories against 
the apostructure (Apo), with a total of around 60 µs worth simulation data. We 
aimed to study the conformational changes using molecular dynamics simulations 
for the inhibitors in the PLpro. PCA analyses and the MSM models revealed 
distinct conformations of PLpro in the absence/presence of ligands and proposed 
that BL2-loop contributes to the accessibility of these inhibitors. Further, 
bulkier substituents closer to Tyr268 and Gln269 could improve inhibition of 
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro by occupying the region between BL2-groove and BL2-loop, but we 
also expand on the relevance of exploring multiple PLpro sub-pockets to improve 
inhibition.
