Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in Arab Mediterranean countries has a different CFTR 
mutational profile if compared either to Caucasians or in the Arabian Peninsula. 
The c.3909C>G (N1303K, p.Asn1303Lys) mutation of the Cystic Fibrosis 
Transmembrane Conductance Regulator gene (CFTR). This mutation represents a 
higher frequency in the Mediterranean countries in association with different 
polymorphisms or mutations in cis position constituting various complex alleles. 
N1303K mutation induces many phenotypes, especially pancreatic insufficiency 
from mild to severe and it is associated in cis with other polymorphisms. The 
aim of this investigation is therefore to screen complex alleles carrying N1303K 
mutation among Lebanese, Egyptian and French patients. All exons of the CFTR and 
their flanking regions were performed by PCR amplification, followed by 
automated direct DNA sequencing. Two complex alleles are more frequent 
corresponding to Wild Type and mutated haplotype. Besides that two other very 
rare complex alleles have been detected, one in Egyptian and French samples, and 
then another one in Lebanon samples. We have studied their impact on the CFTR 
mRNA splicing using a minigene strategy. Constructs containing wild-type and 
mutant CFTR cloned into the pTBNdeI hybride minigene have been expressed in 
HeLa, HT29 and HEK293 cells. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA using β-globin-specific 
primers revealed that N1303K and the polymorphisms associated with cis induce 
weak abnormal splicing and a modification of the quality and the quantity of 
CFTR protein. These different associations of identified polymorphisms with 
N1303K in cis could have an impact on the severity of the disease.
