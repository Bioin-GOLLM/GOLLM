PURPOSE: Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NEN) form a rare 
and remarkably heterogeneous group of tumors. Therefore, establishing 
personalized therapies is eminently challenging. To achieve progress in 
preclinical drug development, there is an urgent need for relevant tumor models.
METHODS: We successfully established three gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumor (GEP-NET) cell lines (NT-18P, NT-18LM, NT-36) and two 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (GEP-NEC) cell lines (NT-32 and 
NT-38). We performed a comprehensive characterization of morphology, NET 
differentiation, proliferation and intracellular signaling pathways of these 
five cell lines and, in addition, of the NT-3 GEP-NET cell line. Additionally, 
we conducted panel sequencing to identify genomic alterations suitable for 
mutation-based targeted therapy.
RESULTS: We found that the GEP-NEN cell lines exhibit a stable neuroendocrine 
phenotype. Functional kinome profiling revealed a higher activity of 
serine/threonine kinases (STK) as well as protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) in the 
GEP-NET cell lines NT-3 and NT-18LM compared to the GEP-NEC cell lines NT-32 and 
NT-38. Panel sequencing revealed a mutation in Death Domain Associated Protein 
(DAXX), sensitizing NT-18LM to the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) 
inhibitor Berzosertib, and a mutation in AT-Rich Interaction Domain 1A (ARID1A), 
sensitizing NT-38 to the Aurora kinase A inhibitor Alisertib. Small interfering 
RNA-mediated knock down of DAXX in the DAXX wild type cell line NT-3 sensitized 
these cells to Berzosertib.
CONCLUSIONS: The newly established GEP-NET and GEP-NEC cell lines represent 
comprehensive preclinical in vitro models suitable to decipher GEP-NEN biology 
and pathogenesis. Additionally, we present the first results of a 
GEP-NEN-specific mutation-based targeted therapy. These findings open up new 
potentialities for personalized therapies in GEP-NEN.
