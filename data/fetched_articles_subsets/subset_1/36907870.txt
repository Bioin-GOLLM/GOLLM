BACKGROUND: The aberrant expression of BRIP1 was associated with several 
cancers; however, the panoramic picture of BRIP1 in human tumors remains 
unclear. This study aims to explore the pan-cancerous picture of the expression 
of BRIP1 across 33 human cancers.
METHODS: Based on the data from TCGA and GTEx, a series of bioinformatic 
analyses were applied to systematically explore the genetic landscape and 
biologic function of BRIP1 in 33 human tumors.
RESULTS: We observed prognosis-related differential BRIP1 expressions between 
various carcinomas and the corresponding normal tissues. "Basal transcription 
factors," "homologous recombination," "nucleotide excision repair," and DNA 
metabolism pathways may play a role in the functional mechanisms of BRIP1. 
Patients with uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma presented with the highest 
alteration frequency of BRIP1 (nearly 10%). Single-nucleotide and copy number 
variations of BRIP1 were noticed in multiple cancers, and the expression of 
BRIP1 is significantly regulated by copy number variation in breast invasive 
carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. BRIP1 expression is negatively 
correlated with the DNA methylation levels in many tumors and is associated with 
the activation of apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA damage response, and inhibition of 
hormone ER and RNS/MARK signaling pathways. Moreover, a positive correlation was 
observed between BRIP1 expression and the immune infiltration levels of 
cancer-associated fibroblasts and CD8+ T cells in lung adenocarcinoma.
CONCLUSION: Our pan-cancer analysis of BRIP1 provides a valuable resource for 
understanding the multimolecular characteristics and biological function of 
BRIP1 across human cancers.
