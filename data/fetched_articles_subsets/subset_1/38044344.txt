The FtsEX complex regulates, directly or via a protein mediator depending on 
bacterial genera, peptidoglycan degradation for cell division. In mycobacteria 
and Gram-positive bacteria, the FtsEX system directly activates 
peptidoglycan-hydrolases by a mechanism that remains unclear. Here we report our 
investigation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis FtsEX as a non-canonical regulator 
with high basal ATPase activity. The cryo-EM structures of the FtsEX system 
alone and in complex with RipC, as well as the ATP-activated state, unveil 
detailed information on the signal transduction mechanism, leading to the 
activation of RipC. Our findings indicate that RipC is recognized through a 
"Match and Fit" mechanism, resulting in an asymmetric rearrangement of the 
extracellular domains of FtsX and a unique inclined binding mode of RipC. This 
study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of FtsEX and RipC 
regulation in the context of a critical human pathogen, guiding the design of 
drugs targeting peptidoglycan remodeling.
