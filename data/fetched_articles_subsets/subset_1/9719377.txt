We report a child with clinical findings consistent with Werdnig-Hoffmann 
disease (spinal muscular atrophy type I) who was found not to have the 
homozygous absence of the survival motor neurone (SMN(T)) gene observed in 
approximately 95% of spinal muscular atrophy patients. A quantitative PCR based 
dosage assay for SMN(T) copy number showed that this patient possessed a single 
copy of the SMN(T) gene. Heteroduplex and sequence analysis of the remaining 
copy of SMN(T) showed a 2 base pair deletion within exon 4 which produces a 
frameshift and premature termination of the deduced SMN(T) protein. This 
protocol of initial SMN(T) gene dosage analysis followed by mutation detection 
allows identification of SMA compound heterozygotes (patients lacking one copy 
of SMN(T) and having another mutation in their other copy), thereby increasing 
the sensitivity of SMA molecular diagnosis.
