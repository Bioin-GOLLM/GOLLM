Primary microcephaly (PM) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder 
with many contributing risk genes and loci identified to date. We report a 
consanguineous family with PM, intellectual disability and short stature. Using 
whole exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous frameshift variant in 
programmed cell death 6 interacting protein (PDCD6IP, c.154_158dup; 
p.Val54Profs*18). This gene, PDCD6IP, plays an important role in the endosomal 
sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway in the abscission stage 
of cytokinesis and apoptosis, and is required for normal brain development in 
mice. The clinical features observed in our patient were similar to the 
phenotypes observed in mouse and zebrafish models of PDCD6IP mutations in 
previous studies. This study provides evidence that clinical manifestations of 
PDCD6IP mutations as seen in our patients with PM and ID may be a novel cause 
for neurodevelopmental disorders.
