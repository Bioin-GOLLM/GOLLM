Classic physiology divides all neural cells into excitable neurons and 
nonexcitable neuroglia. Neuroglial cells, chiefly responsible for homeostasis 
and defense of the nervous tissue, coordinate their complex homeostatic 
responses with neuronal activity. This coordination reflects a specific form of 
glial excitability mediated by complex changes in intracellular concentration of 
ions and second messengers organized in both space and time. Astrocytes are 
equipped with multiple molecular cascades, which are central for regulating 
homeostasis of neurotransmitters, ionostasis, synaptic connectivity, and 
metabolic support of the central nervous system. Astrocytes are further 
provisioned with multiple receptors for neurotransmitters and neurohormones, 
which upon activation trigger intracellular signals mediated by Ca2+, Na+, and 
cyclic AMP. Calcium signals have distinct organization and underlying mechanisms 
in different astrocytic compartments thus allowing complex spatiotemporal 
signaling. Signals mediated by fluctuations in cytosolic Na+ are instrumental 
for coordination of Na+ dependent astrocytic transporters with tissue state and 
homeostatic demands. Astroglial ionic excitability may also involve K+, H+, and 
Cl-. The cyclic AMP signalling system is, in comparison to ions, much slower in 
targeting astroglial effector mechanisms. This evidence review summarizes the 
concept of astroglial intracellular excitability.
