Mutations in keratin 5 (KRT5) or KRT14 genes are responsible for the most severe 
form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), which is EBS generalized severe 
(EBS-gen sev). To date, only four pathogenic mutations (p.Arg165Ser and 
p.Lys199Asn in KRT5; p.Arg125Cys and p.Arg125His in KRT14) have been reported to 
be responsible for EBS-gen sev in the Chinese population. In the present study, 
a 2-year-old Chinese boy was clinically suspected to suffer from EBS, and thus 
Sanger sequencing was performed in the extracted genomic DNA samples from the 
patient, his parents and 100 healthy controls. A novel de novo heterozygous 
missense mutation c.503A>G (p.Glu168Gly) located at the N-terminal end segment 
of the 1A domain in KRT5 was identified by molecular analysis. In silico 
analysis tools were used to predict the pathogenicity of the novel missense 
mutation. A diagnosis of EBS-gen sev was thus confirmed according to the 
clinical presentations and molecular results.
