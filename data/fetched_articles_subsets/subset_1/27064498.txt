RELN encodes a large, secreted glycoprotein integral to proper neuronal 
positioning during development and regulation of synaptic function postnatally. 
Rare, homozygous, null mutations lead to lissencephaly with cerebellar 
hypoplasia (LCH), accompanied by developmental delay and epilepsy. Until 
recently, little was known about the frequency or consequences of heterozygous 
mutations. Several lines of evidence from multiple studies now implicate 
heterozygous mutations in RELN in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). RELN maps to 
the AUTS1 locus on 7q22, and at this time over 40 distinct mutations have been 
identified that would alter the protein sequence, four of which are de novo. The 
RELN mutations that are most clearly consequential are those that are predicted 
to inactivate the signaling function of the encoded protein and those that fall 
in a highly conserved RXR motif found at the core of the 16 Reelin subrepeats. 
Despite the growing evidence of RELN dysfunction in ASD, it appears that these 
mutations in isolation are insufficient and that secondary genetic or 
environmental factors are likely required for a diagnosis.
