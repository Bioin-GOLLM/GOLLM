Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. Biomarkers such 
as levels of amyloid beta (AÎ²) in cerebrospinal fluid and ApoE genotyping were 
suggested for the diagnosis of AD, however, the result is either non-conclusive 
or with invasive procedure. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for AD 
suggested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in many genes are associated 
with the risk of AD, but each only contributed with small effect to the disease. 
By incorporating a panel of established genetic susceptibility factors, the risk 
of an individual in getting AD could be better estimated. Further research will 
be required to reveal if adding to the current well-developed clinical diagnosis 
protocol, the accuracy and specificity of diagnosis of AD would be greatly 
improved and if this might also be beneficial in identifying pre-symptomatic AD 
patients for early diagnosis and intervention of the disease.
