The dependency of cancer cells on glucose can be targeted with high-fat 
low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD). However, hepatic ketogenesis is suppressed 
in IL-6 producing cancers, which prevents the utilization of this nutrient 
source as energy for the organism. In two IL-6 associated murine models of 
cancer cachexia we describe delayed tumor growth but accelerated onset of cancer 
cachexia and shortened survival when mice are fed KD. Mechanistically, we find 
this uncoupling is a consequence of the biochemical interaction of two 
simultaneously occurring NADPH-dependent pathways. Within the tumor, increased 
production of lipid peroxidation products (LPPs) and, consequently, saturation 
of the glutathione (GSH) system leads to ferroptotic death of cancer cells. 
Systemically, redox imbalance and NADPH depletion impairs the biosynthesis of 
corticosterone, the main regulator of metabolic stress, in the adrenal glands. 
Administration of dexamethasone, a potent glucocorticoid, improves food intake, 
normalizes glucose homeostasis and utilization of nutritional substrates, delays 
onset of cancer cachexia and extends survival of tumor-bearing mice fed KD, 
while preserving reduced tumor growth. Our study highlights that the outcome of 
systemic interventions cannot necessarily be extrapolated from the effect on the 
tumor alone, but that they have to be investigated for anti-cancer and host 
effects. These findings may be relevant to clinical research efforts that 
investigate nutritional interventions such as KD in patients with cancer.
