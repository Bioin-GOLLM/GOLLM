PURPOSE: MET amplification is a frequent mechanism of resistance to EGFR 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), and combined treatment with EGFR TKIs and MET TKIs has been 
explored as a strategy to overcome resistance. However, durable response is 
invariably limited by the emergence of acquired resistance. Here, we 
investigated the preclinical activity of REGN5093-M114, a novel antibody-drug 
conjugate targeting MET in MET-driven patient-derived models.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patient-derived organoids, patient-derived cells, or ATCC 
cell lines were used to investigate the in vitro/in vivo activity of 
REGN5093-M114.
RESULTS: REGN5093-M114 exhibited significant antitumor efficacy compared with 
MET TKI or unconjugated METxMET biparatopic antibody (REGN5093). Regardless of 
MET gene copy number, MET-overexpressed TKI-naïve EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells 
responded to REGN5093-M114 treatment. Cell surface MET expression had the most 
predictive power in determining the efficacy of REGN5093-M114. REGN5093-M114 
potently reduced tumor growth of EGFR-mutant NSCLC with PTEN loss or MET Y1230C 
mutation after progression on prior osimertinib and savolitinib treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, REGN5093-M114 is a promising candidate to overcome the 
challenges facing functional MET pathway blockade.
