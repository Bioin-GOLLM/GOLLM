Three-dimensional genome structures play a key role in gene regulation and cell 
functions. Characterization of genome structures necessitates single-cell 
measurements. This has been achieved for haploid cells but has remained a 
challenge for diploid cells. We developed a single-cell chromatin conformation 
capture method, termed Dip-C, that combines a transposon-based whole-genome 
amplification method to detect many chromatin contacts, called META (multiplex 
end-tagging amplification), and an algorithm to impute the two chromosome 
haplotypes linked by each contact. We reconstructed the genome structures of 
single diploid human cells from a lymphoblastoid cell line and from primary 
blood cells with high spatial resolution, locating specific single-nucleotide 
and copy number variations in the nucleus. The two alleles of imprinted loci and 
the two X chromosomes were structurally different. Cells of different types 
displayed statistically distinct genome structures. Such structural cell typing 
is crucial for understanding cell functions.
