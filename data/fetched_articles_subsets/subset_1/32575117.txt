CONTEXT: TMEM127 is a poorly known tumor suppressor gene associated with 
pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and renal carcinomas. Our incomplete 
understanding of TMEM127 function has limited our ability to predict variant 
pathogenicity.
PURPOSE: To better understand the function of the transmembrane protein TMEM127 
we undertook cellular and molecular evaluation of patient-derived germline 
variants.
DESIGN: Subcellular localization and steady-state levels of tumor-associated, 
transiently expressed TMEM127 variants were compared to the wild-type protein 
using immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis, respectively, in cells 
genetically modified to lack endogenous TMEM127. Membrane topology and endocytic 
mechanisms were also assessed.
RESULTS: We identified 3 subgroups of mutations and determined that 71% of the 
variants studied are pathogenic or likely pathogenic through loss of 
membrane-binding ability, stability, and/or internalization capability. 
Investigation into an N-terminal cluster of missense variants uncovered a 
previously unrecognized transmembrane domain, indicating that TMEM127 is a 4- 
transmembrane, not a 3-transmembrane domain-containing protein. Additionally, a 
C-terminal variant with predominant plasma membrane localization revealed an 
atypical, extended acidic, dileucine-based motif required for TMEM127 
internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
CONCLUSION: We characterized the functional deficits of several germline TMEM127 
variants and identified novel structure-function features of TMEM127. These 
findings will assist in determining pathogenicity of TMEM127 variants and will 
help guide future studies investigating the cellular role of TMEM127.
