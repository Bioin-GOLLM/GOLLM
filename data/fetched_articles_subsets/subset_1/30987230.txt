Bombyx mori bidensovirus (BmBDV) is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus from the 
genus Bidensovirus of the Bidnaviridae family, which, thus far, solely infects 
insects. It has a unique genome that contains bipartite DNA molecules (VD1 and 
VD2). In this study, we explored the detailed transcription mapping of the 
complete BmBDV genome (VD1 and VD2) by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), 
reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), and luciferase 
assays. For the first time, we report the transcription map of VD2. Our mapping 
of the transcriptional start sites reveals that the NS genes in VD1 have 
separate transcripts that are derived from overlapping promoters, P5 and P5.5. 
Thus, our study provides a strategy for alternative promoter usage in the 
expression of BmBDV genes.
