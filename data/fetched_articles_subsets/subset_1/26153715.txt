Three photoaffinity ligands (PALs) for the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) 
were synthesized based on the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), 
(S)-citalopram (1). The classic 4-azido-3-iodo-phenyl group was appended to 
either the C-1 or C-5 position of the parent molecule, with variable-length 
linkers, to generate ligands 15, 22, and 26. These ligands retained high to 
moderate affinity binding (K(i) = 24-227 nM) for hSERT, as assessed by 
[(3)H]5-HT transport inhibition. When tested against Ser438Thr hSERT, all three 
PALs showed dramatic rightward shifts in inhibitory potency, with Ki values 
ranging from 3.8 to 9.9 μM, consistent with the role of Ser438 as a key residue 
for high-affinity binding of many SSRIs, including (S)-citalopram. 
Photoactivation studies demonstrated irreversible adduction to hSERT by all 
ligands, but the reduced (S)-citalopram inhibition of labeling by [(125)I]15 
compared to that by [(125)I]22 and [(125)I]26 suggests differences in binding 
mode(s). These radioligands will be useful for characterizing the drug-protein 
binding interactions for (S)-citalopram at hSERT.
