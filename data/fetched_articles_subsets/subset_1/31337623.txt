The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is 
internalized by macrophages and processed in phagolysosomes. Phagosomal 
compaction, a crucial step in phagolysosome maturation, is driven by contact of 
Rab5a-positive vesicles with the phagosomal coat. We show that the sorting nexin 
SNX3 is transported with Rab5a vesicles and that its PX domain enables 
vesicle-phagosome contact by binding to PI(3)P in the phagosomal coat. Moreover, 
the C-terminal region of SNX3 recruits galectin-9, a lectin implicated in 
protein and membrane recycling, which we identify as a further regulator of 
phagosome compaction. SNX3 thus forms a hub for two distinct vesicle 
populations, constituting a convergence point for the endosomal recycling 
machinery, to contribute to phagosome maturation and intracellular processing of 
borreliae. These data also suggest that the helical shape of B. burgdorferi 
itself, providing sites of high curvature and thus local PI(3)P enrichment at 
phagosomes, may be one of the driving elements underlying the efficient 
elimination of spirochetes by immune cells.
