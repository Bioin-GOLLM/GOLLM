BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The heterogeneity of the coronavirus disease of 2019 
(COVID-19) lies within its diverse symptoms and severity, ranging from mild to 
lethal. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a leading cause of 
mortality in COVID-19 patients, characterized by a hyper cytokine storm. 
Autoimmunity is proposed to occur as a result of COVID-19, given the high 
similarity of the immune responses observed in COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases. 
Here, we investigate the level of autoimmune antibodies in COVID-19 patients 
with different severities.
RESULTS: Initial screening for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) IgG using ELISA 
revealed that 1.58% (2/126) and 4% (5/126) of intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 
cases expressed strong and moderate ANA levels, respectively. An additional 
sample was positive with immunofluorescence assays (IFA) screening. However, all 
the non-ICU cases (n=273) were ANA negative using both assays. Samples positive 
for ANA were further confirmed with large-scale autoantibody screening by phage 
immunoprecipitation-sequencing (PhIP-Seq). The majority of the ANA-positive 
samples showed "speckled" ANA pattern by microscopy and revealed autoantibody 
specificities that targeted proteins involved in intracellular signal 
transduction, metabolism, apoptotic processes, and cell death by PhIP-Seq; 
further denoting reactivity to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens.
CONCLUSION: Our results further support the notion of routine screening for 
autoimmune responses in COVID-19 patients, which might help improve disease 
prognosis and patient management. Further, results provide compelling evidence 
that ANA-positive individuals should be excluded from being donors for 
convalescent plasma therapy in the context of COVID-19.
