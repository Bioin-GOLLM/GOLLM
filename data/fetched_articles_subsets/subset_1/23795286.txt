OBJECTIVES: Adult subjects with untreated, lifetime, isolated GH deficiency 
(IGHD) due to a homozygous GHRH receptor gene mutation (MUT/MUT) residing in 
Itabaianinha, Brazil, present with lower BMI, higher prevalence of impaired 
glucose tolerance (IGT), increased insulin sensitivity (IS), and reduced β-cell 
function (βCF) when compared with non-BMI-matched homozygous normal controls. 
However, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in this cohort is unknown. 
Comparing their IS and βCF with BMI-matched individuals heterozygous for the 
same mutation (MUT/N) may be useful to elucidate the role of the GH-IGF1 axis in 
IS and βCF. The purposes of this work were to verify the prevalence of IGT and 
DM in adult MUT/MUT subjects from this kindred and to compare IS and βCF in 
MUT/MUT and MUT/N.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: We studied most (51) of the living IGHD adults of this kindred who are 
GH naive. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) could be performed in 34 
subjects, fasting glucose was measured in 15, while two had a previous diagnosis 
of DM. The OGTT results of 24 MUT/MUT subjects were compared with those of 25 
BMI-matched MUT/N subjects. IS was assessed by homeostatic model assessment of 
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative IS check index, and oral glucose IS 
index for 2 and 3 h. βCF was assayed by HOMA-β, insulinogenic index, and the 
area under the curve of insulin:glucose ratio.
RESULTS: The prevalence of DM and IGT in IGHD was 15.68 and 38.23% respectively. 
IS was increased and βCF was reduced in MUT/MUT in comparison with MUT/N.
CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime, untreated IGHD increases IS, impairs βCF, and does not 
provide protection from diabetes.
