For centuries, species of the genus Consolida (Ranunculaceae) have been 
extensively utilized for their extremely high ornamental and medicinal values. 
Phytochemical investigations of Consolida species have revealed the presence of 
multiple active ingredients, including diterpenoid alkaloids, flavonoids, 
phenolic acids, phytosterols, fatty acids, and volatile constituents. These 
chemical constituents are of great research significance due to their novel 
structures and broad biological activities. This review addresses, for the first 
time, the chemical constituents of Consolida plants and the biological 
activities of these compounds to facilitate future research.
