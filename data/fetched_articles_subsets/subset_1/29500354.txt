Na+-coupled acid-base transporters play essential roles in human biology. Their 
dysfunction has been linked to cancer, heart, and brain disease. High-resolution 
structures of mammalian Na+-coupled acid-base transporters are not available. 
The sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter NBCe1 functions in multiple organs and its 
mutations cause blindness, abnormal growth and blood chemistry, migraines, and 
impaired cognitive function. Here, we have determined the structure of the 
membrane domain dimer of human NBCe1 at 3.9 Å resolution by cryo electron 
microscopy. Our atomic model and functional mutagenesis revealed the ion 
accessibility pathway and the ion coordination site, the latter containing 
residues involved in human disease-causing mutations. We identified a small 
number of residues within the ion coordination site whose modification 
transformed NBCe1 into an anion exchanger. Our data suggest that symporters and 
exchangers utilize comparable transport machinery and that subtle differences in 
their substrate-binding regions have very significant effects on their transport 
mode.
