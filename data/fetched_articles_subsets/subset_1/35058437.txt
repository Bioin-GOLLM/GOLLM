The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the 
pandemic of the coronavirus induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) with evolving 
variants of concern. It remains urgent to identify novel approaches against 
broad strains of SARS-CoV-2, which infect host cells via the entry receptor 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Herein, we report an increase in 
circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) that express ACE2 (evACE2) in plasma of 
COVID-19 patients, which levels are associated with severe pathogenesis. 
Importantly, evACE2 isolated from human plasma or cells neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 
infection by competing with cellular ACE2. Compared to vesicle-free recombinant 
human ACE2 (rhACE2), evACE2 shows a 135-fold higher potency in blocking the 
binding of the viral spike protein RBD, and a 60- to 80-fold higher efficacy in 
preventing infections by both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2. 
Consistently, evACE2 protects the hACE2 transgenic mice from SARS-CoV-2-induced 
lung injury and mortality. Furthermore, evACE2 inhibits the infection of 
SARS-CoV-2 variants (α, β, and δ) with equal or higher potency than for the 
wildtype strain, supporting a broad-spectrum antiviral mechanism of evACE2 for 
therapeutic development to block the infection of existing and future 
coronaviruses that use the ACE2 receptor.
