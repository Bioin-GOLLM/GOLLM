OBJECTIVES: To analyze the vaccination strategy as part of wider public 
governing of the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland.
METHODS: The study provides a synthesis of vaccination strategy and health 
policy measures, as well as economic challenges, in the COVID-19 pandemic in 
Finland. The analysis is based on the systematic collection and reviewing of 
documents and reports. The review was complemented with relevant pandemic and 
vaccination monitoring data from Finland.
RESULTS: The vaccination strategy approved by the Finnish Government in December 
2020 prioritised various risk groups and health and social care professionals 
attending to COVID-19 patients. The Government has purchased COVID-19 vaccines 
through the EU joint procurement programme. Vaccinations were organised by 
municipalities and offered free of charge. The Government recommends universal 
vaccinations, including foreign residents and undocumented migrants. In 2021, 
the Government adopted a revised COVID-19 hybrid strategy, which aimed to 
dismantle wide restrictions as a means to control the epidemic. Despite high 
vaccination coverage, the Omicron variant became widespread in the population. 
The economic consequences of the pandemic have been less severe than expected.
CONCLUSIONS: In the approach to manage the pandemic, the vaccination strategy 
has a central role. Finland has probably benefitted from the EU joint vaccine 
procurement programme. The rapid launch of the vaccinations was supported by the 
existing vaccination capacity in municipalities. High vaccine coverage was seen 
as a key in opening society. Although a relatively high vaccination rate was not 
able to stop the spread of Omicron in late 2021, it has efficiently curbed 
serious cases and kept the death rate low.
