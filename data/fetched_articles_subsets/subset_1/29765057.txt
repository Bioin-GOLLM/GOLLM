Vip3 vegetative insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis are an 
important tool for crop protection against caterpillar pests in IPM strategies. 
While there is wide consensus on their general mode of action, the details of 
their mode of action are not completely elucidated and their structure remains 
unknown. In this work the alanine scanning technique was performed on 558 out of 
the total of 788 amino acids of the Vip3Af1 protein. From the 558 residue 
substitutions, 19 impaired protein expression and other 19 substitutions 
severely compromised the insecticidal activity against Spodoptera frugiperda. 
The latter 19 substitutions mainly clustered in two regions of the protein 
sequence (amino acids 167-272 and amino acids 689-741). Most of these 
substitutions also decreased the activity to Agrotis segetum. The 
characterisation of the sensitivity to proteases of the mutant proteins 
displaying decreased insecticidal activity revealed 6 different band patterns as 
evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The study of the intrinsic fluorescence of most selected 
mutants revealed only slight shifts in the emission peak, likely indicating only 
minor changes in the tertiary structure. An in silico modelled 3D structure of 
Vip3Af1 is proposed for the first time.
