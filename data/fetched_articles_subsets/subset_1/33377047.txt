This protocol combines fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunostaining to 
simultaneously detect, in histological sections from the same animal, 
subpopulations of neurons activated after two episodes of sensory stimulation. 
It allows the identification of groups of cells singly activated by either 
stimulus or co-activated by both stimuli. Our method results in nuclear staining 
for c-Fos mRNA and c-Fos protein, allowing better spatial and temporal 
resolution than previously published protocols, although it requires quick brain 
fixation. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please 
refer to Carvalho et al. (2015, 2020).
