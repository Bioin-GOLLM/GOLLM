In the title di-thio-carbazate ester, C16H17N3S2 (systematic name: 
(Z)-{[(benzyl-sulfan-yl)methane-thio-yl]amino}[1-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)ethyl-idene]amine), 
the central methyl-idenehydrazinecarbodi-thio-ate (C2N2S2) core is almost planar 
(r.m.s. deviation = 0.0111 Å) and forms dihedral angles of 71.67 (3)° with the 
approximately orthogonally inclined thio-ester phenyl ring, and 7.16 (7)° with 
the approximately coplanar substituted pyridyl ring. The latter arrangement and 
the Z configuration about the imine-C=N bond allows for the formation of an 
intra-molecular hydrazine-N-H⋯N(pyrid-yl) hydrogen bond that closes an S(6) 
loop. In the crystal, phenyl-C-H⋯S(thione), methyl-ene-C-H⋯π(pyrid-yl), 
methyl-ene- and phenyl-C-H⋯π(phen-yl) contacts connect mol-ecules into 
supra-molecular layers propagating in the bc plane; the layers stack along the a 
axis with no directional inter-actions between them. The analysis of the 
Hirshfeld surface indicates the relative importance of an intra-layer 
phenyl-H⋯H(pyrid-yl) contact upon the mol-ecular packing.
