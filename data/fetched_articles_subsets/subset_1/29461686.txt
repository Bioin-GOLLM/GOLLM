PURPOSE: Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) represent a group of progressive 
conditions affecting the retina. There is a great genetic heterogeneity causing 
IRDs, and to date, more than 260 genes are associated with IRDs. Stargardt 
disease, type 1 (STGD1) or macular degeneration with flecks, STGD1 represents a 
disease with early onset, central visual impairment, frequent appearance of 
yellowish flecks and mutations in the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A, member 4 
(ABCA4) gene. A large number of intronic sequence variants in ABCA4 have been 
considered pathogenic although their functional effect was seldom demonstrated. 
In this study, we aimed to reveal how intronic variants present in patients with 
Stargardt from the same Swedish family affect splicing.
METHODS: The splicing of the ABCA4 gene was studied in human embryonic kidney 
cells, HEK293T, and in human retinal pigment epithelium cells, ARPE-19, using a 
minigene system containing variants c.4773+3A>G and c.5461-10T>C.
RESULTS: We showed that both ABCA4 variants, c.4773+3A>G and c.5461-10T>C, cause 
aberrant splicing of the ABCA4 minigene resulting in exon skipping. We also 
demonstrated that splicing of ABCA4 has different outcomes depending on 
transfected cell type.
CONCLUSION: Two intronic variants c.4773+3A>G and c.5461-10T>C, both predicted 
to affect splicing, are indeed disease-causing mutations due to skipping of 
exons 33, 34, 39 and 40 of ABCA4 gene. The experimental proof that ABCA4 
mutations in STGD patients affect protein function is crucial for their 
inclusion to future clinical trials; therefore, functional testing of all ABCA4 
intronic variants associated with Stargardt disease by minigene technology is 
desirable.
