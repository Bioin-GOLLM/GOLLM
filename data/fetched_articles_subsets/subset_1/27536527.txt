Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a terminal event in the development of 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has a poor prognosis with median survival 
of 1.9Â months if untreated. The improvement of OS in NSCLC patients relatively 
increases incidence of LM. While current therapeutic options for LM are limited. 
Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors are a class of small 
molecules and show dramatic response in epidermal growth factor receptor mutated 
patients. It also has a distinct therapeutic potential against brain metastases. 
Although there are some studies on EGFR-TKIs and brain metastases, the role of 
EGFR-TKIs on LM are not fully clarified. In this review, we will summarize 
current evidences concerning the use and discuss the role of EGFR-TKIs on LM.
