Dynamin 2 (DNM2) is a key protein of the endocytosis and intracellular membrane 
trafficking machinery. Mutations in the DNM2 gene cause autosomal dominant 
centronuclear myopathy (CNM) and a knock-in mouse model expressing the most 
frequent human DNM2 mutation in CNM (Knock In-Dnm2R465W/+) develops a myopathy 
sharing similarities with human disease. Using isolated muscle fibres from Knock 
In-Dnm2R465W/+ mice, we investigated number, spatial distribution and morphology 
of myonuclei. We showed a reduction of nuclear number from 20 weeks of age in 
Tibialis anterior muscle from heterozygous mice. This reduction is associated 
with a decrease in the satellite cell content in heterozygous muscles. The 
concomitant reduction of myonuclei number and cross-section area in the 
heterozygous fibres contributes to largely maintain myonuclear density and 
volume of myonuclear domain. Moreover, we identified signs of impaired spatial 
nuclear distribution including alteration of distance from myonuclei to their 
nearest neighbours and change in orientation of the nuclei. This study 
highlights reduction of number of myonuclei, a key regulator of the myofiber 
size, as a new pathomechanism underlying muscle atrophy in the dominant 
centronuclear myopathy. In addition, this study opens a new line of 
investigation which could prove particularly important on satellite cells in 
dominant centronuclear myopathy.
