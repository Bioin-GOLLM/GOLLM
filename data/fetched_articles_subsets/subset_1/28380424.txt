AIMS: To investigate the association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) within vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vitamin D receptor 
(VDR) gene polymorphisms and additional gene- gene and gene- smoking interaction 
with multiple myeloma (MM) risk in Chinese population.
METHODS: Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to 
screen the best interaction combination among SNPs and smoking. Logistic 
regression was performed to investigate association between 6 SNPs within VEGF 
and VDR gene, additional gene- gene and gene- smoking interaction on MM risk.
RESULTS: MM risk is significantly higher in carriers with the rs699947- A allele 
within VEGF gene than those with CC genotype (CA+ AA versus CC), adjusted OR 
(95%CI) =1.72 (1.19-2.33), and higher in carriers with rs2228570- T allele 
within VDR gene than those with CC genotype (CT+ TT versus CC), adjusted OR 
(95%CI) = 1.68 (1.26-2.17). We also found a significant two-locus model 
(p=0.0010) involving rs699947 and rs2228570, and a significant two-locus model 
(p=0.0107) involving rs2228570 andsmoking. Participants with rs699947- CA+AA and 
rs2228570- CT+TT genotype had the highest MM risk, compared to participants with 
rs699947- CC and rs2228570- CC genotype, OR (95%CI) = 3.12 (1.82 -4.61). Smokers 
with rs2228570- CT+TT genotype had the highest MM risk, compared to never- 
smokers with rs2228570- CC genotype, OR (95%CI) = 3.27 (1.74-4.86).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the A allele of rs699947 within VEGF and T allele of 
rs2228570 within VDR gene, interaction between rs699947 and rs2228570, rs2228570 
andsmoking were all associated with increased MM risk.
