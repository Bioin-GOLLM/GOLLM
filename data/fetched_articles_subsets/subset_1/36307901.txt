Superenhancers drive abnormal gene expression in tumors and promote malignancy. 
However, the relationship between superenhancer-associated long noncoding RNA 
(lncRNA) and abnormal metabolism is unknown. This study identifies a novel 
lncRNA, fatty acid synthesis-related lncRNA (FASRL), whose expression is driven 
by upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) through its superenhancer. FASRL 
promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. 
Furthermore, FASRL binds to acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACACA), a fatty acid 
synthesis rate-limiting enzyme, increasing fatty acid synthesis via the fatty 
acid metabolism pathway. Moreover, the expression of FASRL, USF1, and ACACA is 
increased, and their high expression indicates a worse prognosis in HCC 
patients. In summary, USF1 drives FASRL transcription via a superenhancer. FASRL 
binding to ACACA increases fatty acid synthesis and lipid accumulation to 
mechanistically exacerbate HCC. FASRL may serve as a novel prognostic marker and 
treatment target in HCC.
