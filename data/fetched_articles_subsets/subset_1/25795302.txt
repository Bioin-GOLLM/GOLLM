Understanding how Munc18 proteins govern exocytosis is crucial because mutations 
of this protein cause severe secretion deficits in neuronal and immune cells. 
Munc18-2 has indispensable roles in the degranulation of mast cell, partly by 
binding and chaperoning a subset of syntaxin isoforms. However, the key syntaxin 
that, crucially, participates in the degranulation – whose levels and 
intracellular localization are regulated by Munc18-2 – remains unknown. Here, we 
demonstrate that double knockdown of Munc18-1 and Munc-2 in mast cells results 
in greatly reduced degranulation accompanied with strikingly compromised 
expression levels and localization of syntaxin-3. This phenotype is fully 
rescued by wild-type Munc18 proteins but not by the K46E, E59K and K46E/E59K 
mutants of Munc-18 domain 1, each of which exhibits completely abolished binding 
to 'closed' syntaxin-3. Furthermore, knockdown of syntaxin-3 strongly impairs 
degranulation. Collectively, our data argue that residues Lys46 and Glu59 of 
Munc18 proteins are indispensable for mediating the interaction between Munc18 
and closed syntaxin-3, which is essential for degranulation by chaperoning 
syntaxin-3. Our results also indicate that the functional contribution of these 
residues differs between immune cell degranulation and neuronal secretion.
