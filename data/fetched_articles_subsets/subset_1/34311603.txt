OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether GSTA1, GSTO2, and GSTZ1 are relevant to an 
increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a Chinese population.
METHODS: In this study, 143 sporadic ALS (sALS) patients (83 men, 60 women) and 
210 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were enrolled. Blood samples were 
collected by venipuncture. Genomic DNA was isolated by polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) according to the 
manufacturer's instructions. The potential associations between ALS and GSTA1, 
GSTO2, and GSTZ1 polymorphisms were estimated using chi-squared analysis and 
unconditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: The D allele and genotype frequencies of GSTO2 were increased in sALS 
patients compared with healthy subjects, indicating that the GSTO2 DD genotype 
was associated with an increased risk of sALS (odds ratio [OR] = 3.294, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 1.039-10.448). However, a significant association 
between the DD genotype and the risk of sALS was evident in men only 
(OR = 7.167, 95% CI = 1.381-37.202).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the D allele and genotype frequencies of 
GSTO2 were increased in sALS patients. The GSTO2 DD genotype was associated with 
an increased risk of sALS in men in a Chinese population.
