OBJECTIVE: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) 
are severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions. Antiseizure medications (ASMs) with 
aromatic ring structure, including carbamazepine, are among the most common 
culprits. Screening for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele HLA-B*15:02 is 
recommended prior to initiating treatment with carbamazepine in Asians, but this 
allele has low positive predictive value.
METHODS: We performed whole genome sequencing and analyzed 6 199 696 common 
variants among 113 aromatic ASM-induced SJS/TEN cases and 84 tolerant controls 
of Han Chinese ethnicity.
RESULTS: In the primary analysis, nine variants reached genome-wide significance 
(p < 5e-08), one in the carbamazepine subanalysis (85 cases vs. 77 controls) and 
a further eight identified in HLA-B*15:02-negative subanalysis (35 cases and 53 
controls). Interaction analysis between each novel variant from the primary 
analysis found that five increased risk irrespective of HLA-B*15:02 status or 
zygosity. HLA-B*15:02-positive individuals were found to have reduced risk if 
they also carried a chromosome 12 variant, chr12.9426934 (heterozygotes: 
relative risk = .71, p = .001; homozygotes: relative risk = .23, p < .001). All 
significant variants lie within intronic or intergenic regions with poorly 
understood functional consequence. In silico functional analysis of suggestive 
variants (p < 5e-6) identified through the primary and subanalyses (stratified 
by HLA-B*15:02 status and drug exposure) suggests that genetic variation within 
regulatory DNA may contribute to risk indirectly by disrupting the regulation of 
pathology-related genes. The genes implicated were specific either to the 
primary analysis (CD9), HLA-B*15:02 carriers (DOCK10), noncarriers (ABCA1), 
carbamazepine exposure (HLA-E), or phenytoin exposure (CD24).
SIGNIFICANCE: We identified variants that could explain why some carriers of 
HLA-B*15:02 tolerate treatment, and why some noncarriers develop ASM-induced 
SJS/TEN. Additionally, this analysis suggests that the mixing of HLA-B*15:02 
carrier status in previous studies might have masked variants contributing to 
susceptibility, and that inheritance of risk for ASM-induced SJS/TEN is complex, 
likely involving multiple risk variants.
