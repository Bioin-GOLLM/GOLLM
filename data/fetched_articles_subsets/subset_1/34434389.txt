Sickle cell disease (SCD) can pose serious maternal and fetal risk in pregnancy. 
Transfusion, both during and outside of pregnancy, can improve patient morbidity 
and mortality but carries risk of alloimmunization, complicating future 
management. This case describes a 29-year-old gravida 1, para 0 woman with 
sickle cell anemia and rare red blood cell alloantibody (anti-Rh46) who 
presented with severe vaso-occlusive crisis at 29 weeks with hemoglobin of 7.6 
g/dL. Only one unit of compatible blood existed in the country. Planning for 
transfusion with least-incompatible blood was made. She ultimately underwent 
cesarean section at 31 weeks and 2 days for abnormal fetal testing. This case 
highlights that blood products should be utilized judiciously because their 
adverse effects, like alloimmunization, can increase patient morbidity and 
mortality.
