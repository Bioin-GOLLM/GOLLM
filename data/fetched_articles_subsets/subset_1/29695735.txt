Many bioinformatics resources with unique perspectives on the protein landscape 
are currently available. However, generating new knowledge from these resources 
requires interoperable workflows that support cross-resource queries. In this 
study, we employ federated queries linking information from the Protein Kinase 
Ontology, iPTMnet, Protein Ontology, neXtProt, and the Mouse Genome Informatics 
to identify key knowledge gaps in the functional coverage of the human kinome 
and prioritize understudied kinases, cancer variants and post-translational 
modifications (PTMs) for functional studies. We identify 32 functional domains 
enriched in cancer variants and PTMs and generate mechanistic hypotheses on 
overlapping variant and PTM sites by aggregating information at the residue, 
protein, pathway and species level from these resources. We experimentally test 
the hypothesis that S768 phosphorylation in the C-helix of EGFR is inhibitory by 
showing that oncogenic variants altering S768 phosphorylation increase basal 
EGFR activity. In contrast, oncogenic variants altering conserved 
phosphorylation sites in the 'hydrophobic motif' of PKCÎ²II (S660F and S660C) are 
loss-of-function in that they reduce kinase activity and enhance membrane 
translocation. Our studies provide a framework for integrative, consistent, and 
reproducible annotation of the cancer kinomes.
