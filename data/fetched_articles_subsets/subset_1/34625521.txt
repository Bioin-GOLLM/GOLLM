Human CMV (HCMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that indelibly shapes the NK cell 
repertoire. Using transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic approaches to 
evaluate peripheral blood NK cells from healthy human volunteers, we find that 
prior HCMV infection promotes NK cells with a T cell-like gene profile, 
including the canonical markers CD3ε, CD5, and CD8β, as well as the T cell 
lineage-commitment transcription factor Bcl11b. Although Bcl11b expression is 
upregulated during NK maturation from CD56bright to CD56dim, we find a 
Bcl11b-mediated signature at the protein level for FcεRIγ, PLZF, IL-2Rβ, CD3γ, 
CD3δ, and CD3ε in later-stage, HCMV-induced NK cells. BCL11B is targeted by 
Notch signaling in T cell development, and culture of NK cells with Notch ligand 
increases cytoplasmic CD3ε expression. The Bcl11b-mediated gain of CD3ε, 
physically associated with CD16 signaling molecules Lck and CD247 in NK cells is 
correlated with increased Ab-dependent effector function, including against 
HCMV-infected cells, identifying a potential mechanism for their prevalence in 
HCMV-infected individuals and their prospective clinical use in Ab-based 
therapies.
