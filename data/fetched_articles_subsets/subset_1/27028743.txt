Drug-induced long-QT syndrome (diLQTS) is often due to drug block of IKr, 
especially in genetically susceptible patients with subclinical mutations in the 
IKr-encoding KCHN2. Few variants in the cardiac NaV1.5 Na+ channel complex have 
been associated with diLQTS. We tested whether a novel SNTA1 (α1-syntrophin) 
variant (p.E409Q) found in a patient with diLQTS increases late sodium current 
(INa-L), thereby providing a disease mechanism. Electrophysiological studies 
were performed in HEK293T cells co-expressing human NaV1.5/nNOS/PMCA4b with 
either wild type (WT) or SNTA1 variants (A390V-previously reported in congenital 
LQTS; and E409Q); and in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes infected with 
SNTA1 expressing adenoviruses (WT or one of the two SNTA1 variants). In HEK293T 
cells and in cardiomyocytes, there was no significant difference in the peak INa 
densities among the SNTA1 WT and variants. However, both variants increased 
INa-L (% of peak current) in HEK293T cells (0.58 ± 0.10 in WT vs. 0.90 ± 0.11 in 
A390V, p = 0.048; vs. 0.88 ± 0.07 in E409Q, p = 0.023). In cardiomyocytes, INa-L 
was significantly increased by E409Q, but not by A390V compared to WT (0.49 ± 
0.14 in WT vs.0.94 ± 0.23 in A390V, p = 0.099; vs. 1.12 ± 0.24 in E409Q, p = 
0.019). We demonstrated that a novel SNTA1 variant is likely causative for 
diLQTS by augmenting INa-L. These data suggest that variants within the 
NaV1.5-interacting α1-syntrophin are a potential mechanism for diLQTS, thereby 
expanding the concept that variants within congenital LQTS loci can cause 
diLQTS.
