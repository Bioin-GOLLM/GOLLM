Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative 
disease and Late-Onset type (LOAD) is the most common form of dementia affecting 
people over 65 years old. CALHM1 (P86L) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein 
that controls cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and Aβ levels and P86L 
polymorphism in this gene is significantly associated with LOAD in independent 
case controls in a number of studies. This study was performed to determine 
whether this polymorphism contributes to the risk for LOAD in Iranian 
population. One hundred and forty one AD patients and 141 healthy controls were 
recruited in this study. After extraction of genomic DNA, the genotype and 
allele frequencies were determined in case and control subjects using PCR/RFLP 
method. The statistical analysis showed a significant difference in the 
heterozygote genotype frequency in case and control groups and polymorphic 
allele had a protective role between two groups. Also after stratifying the 
subjects by their APOE-ɛ4 status, no significant association was observed. Our 
study suggests that P86L polymorphism could be a protective factor for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Iranian population. However, to confirm 
these results, further study with a bigger sample size may be required.
