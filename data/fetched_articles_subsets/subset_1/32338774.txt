Diabetes-associated organ fibrosis, marked by elevated cellular senescence, is a 
growing health concern. Intriguingly, the mechanism underlying this association 
remained unknown. Moreover, insulin alone can neither reverse organ fibrosis nor 
the associated secretory phenotype, favoring the exciting notion that thus far 
unknown mechanisms must be operative. Here, we show that experimental type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes impairs DNA repair, leading to senescence, inflammatory 
phenotypes, and ultimately fibrosis. Carbohydrates were found to trigger this 
cascade by decreasing the NAD+ /NADH ratio and NHEJ-repair in vitro and in 
diabetes mouse models. Restoring DNA repair by nuclear over-expression of 
phosphomimetic RAGE reduces DNA damage, inflammation, and fibrosis, thereby 
restoring organ function. Our study provides a novel conceptual framework for 
understanding diabetic fibrosis on the basis of persistent DNA damage signaling 
and points to unprecedented approaches to restore DNA repair capacity for 
resolution of fibrosis in patients with diabetes.
