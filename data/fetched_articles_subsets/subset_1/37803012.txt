Melanin pigments play a critical role in physiological processes and shaping 
animal behaviour. Fossil melanin is a unique resource for understanding the 
functional evolution of melanin but the impact of fossilisation on molecular 
signatures for eumelanin and, especially, phaeomelanin is not fully understood. 
Here we present a model for the chemical taphonomy of fossil eumelanin and 
phaeomelanin based on thermal maturation experiments using feathers from extant 
birds. Our results reveal which molecular signatures are authentic signals for 
thermally matured eumelanin and phaeomelanin, which signatures are artefacts 
derived from the maturation of non-melanin molecules, and how these chemical 
data are impacted by sample preparation. Our model correctly predicts the 
molecular composition of eumelanins in diverse vertebrate fossils from the 
Miocene and Cretaceous and, critically, identifies direct molecular evidence for 
phaeomelanin in these fossils. This taphonomic framework adds to the geochemical 
toolbox that underpins reconstructions of melanin evolution and of melanin-based 
coloration in fossil vertebrates.
