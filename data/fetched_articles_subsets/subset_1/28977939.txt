CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) functions as both an oncogenic and a tumor 
suppressor, depending on the cancer type, through epigenetic regulation. 
Epigenetic regulation plays a key role in cancer metastasis. Our objective was 
to investigate whether CTCF plays a crucial role in epithelial ovarian cancer 
metastasis. First, we found that CTCF expression was increased in ovarian cancer 
tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. Increased expression of CTCF predicts 
poor prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. In addition, CTCF knockdown 
significantly inhibited the metastasis of ovarian cancer cells, although it had 
no effect on cell proliferation and tumor growth. More importantly, CTCF 
expression was higher in metastatic lesions compared to primary tumors from the 
same ovarian cancer patients. We also demonstrated that CTCF affects a number of 
metastasis-associated genes, including CTBP1, SERPINE1 and SRC. Additionally, 
our ChIP-seq results revealed that these genes have multiple CTCF-binding sites, 
findings that were further confirmed by ChIP-PCR. Our results suggest that CTCF 
could be a novel drug target to treat ovarian cancer by interfering with cancer 
cell metastasis.
