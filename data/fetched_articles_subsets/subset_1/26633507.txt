Small peptides isolated from the venom of animals are potential scaffolds for 
ion channel drug discovery. This review article mainly focuses on the 
computational studies that have advanced our understanding of how various toxins 
interfere with the function of K‚Å∫ channels. We introduce the computational tools 
available for the study of toxin-channel interactions. We then discuss how these 
computational tools have been fruitfully applied to elucidate the mechanisms of 
action of a wide range of venom peptides from scorpions, spiders, and sea 
anemone.
