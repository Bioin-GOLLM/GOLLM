Structure-specific endonucleases resolve DNA secondary structures generated 
during DNA repair and recombination. The yeast 5' flap endonuclease Slx1-Slx4 
has received particular attention with the finding that Slx4 has 
Slx1-independent key functions in genome maintenance. Although Slx1 is a highly 
conserved protein in eukaryotes, no orthologs of Slx4 were reported other than 
in fungi. Here we report the identification of Slx4 orthologs in metazoa, 
including fly MUS312, essential for meiotic recombination, and human BTBD12, an 
ATM/ATR checkpoint kinase substrate. Human SLX1-SLX4 displays robust Holliday 
junction resolvase activity in addition to 5' flap endonuclease activity. 
Depletion of SLX1 and SLX4 results in 53BP1 foci accumulation and H2AX 
phosphorylation as well as cellular hypersensitivity to MMS. Furthermore, we 
show that SLX4 binds the XPF(ERCC4) and MUS81 subunits of the XPF-ERCC1 and 
MUS81-EME1 endonucleases and is required for DNA interstrand crosslink repair. 
We propose that SLX4 acts as a docking platform for multiple structure-specific 
endonucleases.
