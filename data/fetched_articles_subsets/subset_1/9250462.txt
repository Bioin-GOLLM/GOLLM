OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the Trp64Arg polymorphism of the 
beta3-adrenergic receptor gene with NIDDM and the features of insulin resistance 
syndrome in subjects from eastern Finland.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined the prevalence of the Trp64Arg 
polymorphism of the beta3-adrenergic receptor gene by restriction fragment 
length polymorphism analysis in 110 patients with NIDDM (54 men and 56 women, 
age 63 +/- 1 years, BMI 30.4 +/- 0.5 kg/m2), in 183 patients with features of 
insulin resistance syndrome (103 men and 80 women, age 44 +/- 0 years, BMI 31.1 
+/- 0.4 kb/m2), and in 82 normoglycemic control men (age 54 +/- 1 years, BMI 
26.3 +/- 0.4 kg/m2).
RESULTS: The allele frequency of the Trp64Arg polymorphism of the 
beta3-adrenergic receptor gene was similar in patients with NIDDM, in patients 
with insulin resistance syndrome, and in control subjects (0.08, 0.07, and 0.07, 
respectively; NS). In addition, this polymorphism was not associated with low 
resting metabolic rate, abdominal obesity, increased lipid oxidation, 
hypertension, or earlier development of NIDDM as previously described. 
Furthermore, in 82 normoglycemic male control subjects the Trp64Arg polymorphism 
was not associated with insulin resistance evaluated by the 
euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp.
CONCLUSIONS: The Trp64Arg polymorphism of the beta 3-adrenergic receptor gene is 
unlikely to be a major genetic predisposer to NIDDM or insulin resistance 
syndrome in subjects from eastern Finland.
