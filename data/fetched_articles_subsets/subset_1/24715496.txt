A safe and effective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
is urgently needed to combat the worldwide AIDS pandemic, but still remains 
elusive. The fact that uncontrolled replication of an attenuated vaccine can 
lead to regaining of its virulence creates safety concerns precluding many 
vaccines from clinical application. We introduce a novel approach to control 
HIV-1 replication, which entails the manipulation of essential HIV-1 protein 
biosynthesis through unnatural amino acid (UAA*)-mediated suppression of 
genome-encoded blank codon. We successfully demonstrate that HIV-1 replication 
can be precisely turned on and off in vitro.
