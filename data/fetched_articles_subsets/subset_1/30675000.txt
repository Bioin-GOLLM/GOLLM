Seeded polymerisation of proteins forming amyloid fibres and their spread in 
tissues has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative 
diseases: so called "prion-like" mechanisms. While ex vivo mammalian prions, 
composed of multichain assemblies of misfolded host-encoded prion protein (PrP), 
act as lethal infectious agents, PrP amyloid fibrils produced in vitro generally 
do not. The high-resolution structure of authentic infectious prions and the 
structural basis of prion strain diversity remain unknown. Here we use 
cryo-electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy to examine the structure of 
highly infectious PrP rods isolated from mouse brain in comparison to 
non-infectious recombinant PrP fibrils generated in vitro. Non-infectious 
recombinant PrP fibrils are 10 nm wide single fibres, with a double helical 
repeating substructure displaying small variations in adhesive force 
interactions across their width. In contrast, infectious PrP rods are 20 nm wide 
and contain two fibres, each with a double helical repeating substructure, 
separated by a central gap of 8-10 nm in width. This gap contains an irregularly 
structured material whose adhesive force properties are strikingly different to 
that of the fibres, suggestive of a distinct composition. The structure of the 
infectious PrP rods, which cause lethal neurodegeneration, readily 
differentiates them from all other protein assemblies so far characterised in 
other neurodegenerative diseases.
