Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), together 
with an operon of CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, form an RNA-based 
prokaryotic immune system against exogenous genetic elements. Cas5 family 
proteins are found in several type I CRISPR-Cas systems. Here, we report the 
molecular function of subtype I-C/Dvulg Cas5d from Bacillus halodurans. We show 
that Cas5d cleaves pre-crRNA into unit length by recognizing both the hairpin 
structure and the 3' single stranded sequence in the CRISPR repeat region. Cas5d 
structure reveals a ferredoxin domain-based architecture and a catalytic triad 
formed by Y46, K116, and H117 residues. We further show that after pre-crRNA 
processing, Cas5d assembles with crRNA, Csd1, and Csd2 proteins to form a 
multi-sub-unit interference complex similar to Escherichia coli Cascade 
(CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) in architecture. Our results 
suggest that formation of a crRNA-presenting Cascade-like complex is likely a 
common theme among type I CRISPR subtypes.
