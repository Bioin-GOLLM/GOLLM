BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus infection of livestock animals and humans is a 
major public health issue. There are reports of antimicrobial resistance and 
multiple staphylococcal superantigen genes in many countries and several 
provinces of China, but the status in Chongqing, China is uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, antimicrobial 
susceptibility, and other molecular characteristics of S. aureus isolates from 
livestock animals in Chongqing.
METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated and identified by selective 
enrichment and amplification of the nuc gene from 1371 samples collected at 
farms in Chongqing. The agar dilution method was used to determine the resistant 
phenotype, and extended spectrum β-lactamase genes were amplified by PCR. 
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was verified by the presence of the mecA gene, 
and the presence or absence of SE, SEl, and TSST-1 genes was detected in the 
isolates.
RESULTS: We cultured 89 S. aureus isolates from 1371 samples between March 2014 
and December 2017. These isolates were from pigs, cattle, goats, rabbits, and 
chickens. There were four methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (three from 
pigs and one from a chicken). The 89 isolates had high resistance to penicillin 
(93.3%) and ampicillin (92.1%), but most were susceptible to amikacin and 
ofloxacin, with resistance rates below 10%. A total of 62.9% of the isolates had 
varying degrees of multidrug resistance. Almost all strains, except for three 
isolates from chickens, were positive for blaTEM-1a . There were 19 of 20 tested 
staphylococcal SE/SEl/TSST-1 genes present (all except for seq), and the 
predominant genes were sei (58.4%), tst-1 (56.2%), and seg (51.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: The high antimicrobial resistance and prevalence of blaTEM-1a 
reinforce the need to reduce the usage of antimicrobials in livestock. The 
universal existence of staphylococcal toxin genes implies a potential threat to 
public health by animal-to-human transmission via the food chain.
