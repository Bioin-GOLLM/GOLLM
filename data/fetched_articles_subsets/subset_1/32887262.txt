Lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) are a group of three enzymes (LPP1-3) that 
belong to a phospholipid phosphatase (PLPP) family. The LPPs dephosphorylate a 
wide spectrum of bioactive lipid phosphates, among which lysophosphatidate (LPA) 
and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are two important extracellular signaling 
molecules. The LPPs are integral membrane proteins, which are localized on 
plasma membranes and intracellular membranes, including the endoplasmic 
reticulum and Golgi network. LPPs regulate signaling transduction in cancer 
cells and demonstrate different effects in cancer progression through the 
breakdown of extracellular LPA and S1P and other intracellular substrates. This 
review is intended to summarize an up-to-date understanding about the functions 
of LPPs in cancers.
