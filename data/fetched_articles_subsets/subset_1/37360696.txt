Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays critical roles in brain development. SRSF10 
is a splicing factor highly expressed in central nervous system and plays 
important roles in maintaining normal brain functions. However, its role in 
neural development is unclear. In this study, by conditional depleting SRSF10 in 
neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vivo and in vitro, we found that dysfunction 
of SRSF10 leads to developmental defects of the brain, which manifest as 
abnormal ventricle enlargement and cortical thinning anatomically, as well as 
decreased NPCs proliferation and weakened cortical neurogenesis histologically. 
Furthermore, we proved that the function of SRSF10 on NPCs proliferation 
involved the regulation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR-CCND2 pathway and the alternative 
splicing of Nasp, a gene encoding isoforms of cell cycle regulators. These 
findings highlight the necessity of SRSF10 in the formation of a structurally 
and functionally normal brain.
