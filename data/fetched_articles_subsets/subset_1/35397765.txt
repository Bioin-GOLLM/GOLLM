INTRODUCTION: We aimed to elucidate the impact of metabolic syndrome (MS) and 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on treatment-naïve patients with 
chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT).
METHODS: We analyzed the clinical characteristics of a cross-sectional cohort of 
treatment-naïve patients with CHB and ALT in the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
from October 2018 to July 2021. ALT ≤ 0.5 ULN was stratified as low-normal ALT 
(LNALT) and 0.5 ULN < ALT ≤ ULN as high-normal ALT (HNALT). Transient 
elastography (TE) was used to evaluate liver steatosis and fibrosis.
RESULTS: Among 733 patients with CHB enrolled, 23.1% of them had MS, 37.2% of 
them had NAFLD, and 5.9% of them had significant fibrosis. The proportions of 
patients with MS, steatosis, and significant fibrosis in the HNALT group were 
higher than those in the LNALT group (31.4% vs. 14.1%, p < 0.001; 48.7% vs. 
25.2%, p < 0.001; and 8.0% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.013, respectively). Multiple linear 
regression showed that steatosis (beta = 0.098, p = 0.001) and MS (beta = 0.092, 
p = 0.002) were independently related to ALT levels in the normal range. 
Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (OR 1.049, 95% CI 1.012-1.087, 
p = 0.010), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (OR 1.059, 95% CI 1.005-1.115, 
p = 0.030), and severe steatosis (OR 2.559, 95% CI 1.212-5.403, p = 0.014) were 
independently associated with significant fibrosis. When analyzed in the 
subgroup of CHB with NAFLD, age (OR 1.060, 95% CI 1.006-1.117, p = 0.029) and 
severe steatosis (OR 2.962, 95% CI 1.126-7.792, p = 0.028) were still 
statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The accumulation of MS components exacerbated hepatic steatosis. 
Severe NAFLD was independently associated with significant fibrosis. This 
emphasizes the importance of screening for MS and NAFLD in patients with CHB and 
normal ALT, where a more active intervention may apply.
