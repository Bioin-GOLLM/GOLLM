PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible relationship between 
four single nucleotide polymorphisms of hemangioma-linked genes encoding for 
anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1 G976A), R kinase insert domain receptor (KDR 
T1444C), adrenoceptor beta 2 (ADRB C79CG), and insulin-like growth factor 1 
receptor (IGF-1R G3174A) and the occurrence of IVH in a population of preterm 
infants.
METHODS: The study includes a population of 105 infants born from 24 + 0 to 
32 + 0 weeks of gestation and hospitalized at the Department of Neonatology (III 
level hospital) of Poznan University of Medical Science. Intraventricular 
hemorrhage was diagnosed with the use of cranial ultrasound. The classification 
of intraventricular bleeding was based on the Papile IVH classification.
RESULTS: The incidence of IVH was higher in infants with lower birth weight, 
lower APGAR scores, and low birth weight. The study revealed that IVH was 
approximately two times less likely to occur in infants with the allele G of 
IGF-1R 3174G > A.
CONCLUSION: Identifying susceptible premature infants through genetic analysis 
could be a potential way to alleviate severe IVH and its subsequent 
consequences. Further research examining a wider range of relevant gene 
polymorphisms could help highlight any genetic patterns in this deleterious 
bleeding complication.
