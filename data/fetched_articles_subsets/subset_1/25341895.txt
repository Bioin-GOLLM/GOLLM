AIMS: Intracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the 
rate-limiting enzyme for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) 
biosynthesis. This study investigated the role of NAMPT-mediated NAD(+) 
signalling in post-ischaemic vascular repair.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mouse hind-limb ischaemia up-regulated NAMPT expression and 
NAD(+) level in bone marrow (BM). Pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT by a 
chemical inhibitor FK866 impaired the mobilization of endothelial progenitor 
cells (EPCs) from BM upon ischaemic stress. Transgenic mice overexpressing NAMPT 
(Tg mice), but not H247A-mutant dominant-negative NAMPT (DN-Tg mice), exhibited 
enhanced capillary density, increased number of proliferating endothelial cells, 
improved blood flow recovery, and augmented collateral arterioles in the 
ischaemic limb. In cultured BM-derived EPCs, inhibition of NAMPT suppressed 
proliferation, migration, and tube formation, whereas overexpression of NAMPT 
induced opposite effects. The promoting effects of NAMPT on EPCs were abolished 
by silencing of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), rather than silencing of SIRT2-7. 
Overexpression of NAMPT led to a SIRT1-depedent enhancement of Notch-1 
intracellular domain deacetylation, which inhibited Delta-like ligand-4 
(DLL4)-Notch signalling and thereby up-regulated of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. 
Injection of recombinant VEGF induced a more pronounced EPC mobilization in Tg, 
but not in DN-Tg, mice. Furthermore, overexpression of NAMPT down-regulated 
Fringe family glycosyltransferases in a SIRT1-dependent manner, which rendered 
Notch more sensitive to the pro-angiogenic ligand Jagged1 rather than the 
anti-angiogenic ligand DLL4.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that intracellular NAMPT-NAD(+)-SIRT1 
cascade improves post-ischaemic neovascularization. The modulation of Notch 
signalling may contribute to the enhanced post-ischaemic neovascularization.
