BACKGROUND: Medication treatment can reduce morbidity but can also cause 
drug-related problems (DRPs). One method to identify and solve DRPs is 
medication reviews (MRs) that are aimed at increased patient safety and quality 
in drug treatment. In Skåne county, Sweden, a well-established 
multi-professional model for MRs in nursing homes is practiced. However, a 
demand for MRs regarding community-dwelling patients has emerged. These patients 
may be extra vulnerable since they have less supervision from healthcare 
personnel.
AIM: To describe the community-dwelling patients in primary healthcare 
considered in need of an MR, as well as the outcomes of these pharmacist-led 
MRs.
METHODS: Personnel from 14 primary healthcare centers selected patients for the 
MRs. Based on electronic medical records, the symptom assessment tool PHASE-20 
(PHArmacotherapeutical Symptom Evaluation 20 questions) and medication lists, 
pharmacists conducted MRs and communicated adjustment suggestions via the 
medical record to the general practitioners (GPs).
RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were included in the study and 90.8% (n = 99) 
of the patients were exposed to at least one DRP, with an average of 3.9 DRPs 
per patient. Patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate, 
GFR < 45 ml/min) or ≥ 10 medications were exposed to a significantly higher 
number of DRPs per patient, 5.1 DRP and 5.3 respectively. The most frequent 
DRP-categories were Unnecessary drug therapy and Adverse drug reaction, which 
represented 23.0% respectively 22.9% of the total amount of DRPs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a prioritized need for MRs for 
community-dwelling patients, specifically with impaired renal function or 
polypharmacy.
