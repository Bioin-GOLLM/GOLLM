HIV significantly affects the immunological environment during tuberculosis 
coinfection, and therefore may influence the selective landscape upon which M. 
tuberculosis evolves. To test this hypothesis whole genome sequences were 
determined for 169 South African M. tuberculosis strains from HIV-1 coinfected 
and uninfected individuals and analyzed using two Bayesian codon-model based 
selection analysis approaches: FUBAR which was used to detect persistent 
positive and negative selection (selection respectively favoring and disfavoring 
nonsynonymous substitutions); and MEDS which was used to detect episodic 
directional selection specifically favoring nonsynonymous substitutions within 
HIV-1 infected individuals. Among the 25,251 polymorphic codon sites analyzed, 
FUBAR revealed that 189-fold more were detectably evolving under persistent 
negative selection than were evolving under persistent positive selection. Three 
specific codon sites within the genes celA2b, katG, and cyp138 were identified 
by MEDS as displaying significant evidence of evolving under directional 
selection influenced by HIV-1 coinfection. All three genes encode proteins that 
may indirectly interact with human proteins that, in turn, interact functionally 
with HIV proteins. Unexpectedly, epitope encoding regions were enriched for 
sites displaying weak evidence of directional selection influenced by HIV-1. 
Although the low degree of genetic diversity observed in our M. tuberculosis 
data set means that these results should be interpreted carefully, the effects 
of HIV-1 on epitope evolution in M. tuberculosis may have implications for the 
design of M. tuberculosis vaccines that are intended for use in populations with 
high HIV-1 infection rates.
