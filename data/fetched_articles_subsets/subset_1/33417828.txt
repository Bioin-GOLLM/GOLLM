Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) counteract ubiquitylation to control stability 
or activity of substrates. Identification of DUB substrates is challenging 
because multiple DUBs can act on the same substrate, thwarting genetic 
approaches. Here, we circumvent redundancy by chemically inhibiting multiple 
DUBs simultaneously in Xenopus egg extract. We used quantitative mass 
spectrometry to identify proteins whose ubiquitylation or stability is altered 
by broad DUB inhibition, and confirmed their DUB-dependent regulation with human 
orthologs, demonstrating evolutionary conservation. We next extended this method 
to profile DUB specificity. By adding recombinant DUBs to extract where DUB 
activity was broadly inhibited, but ubiquitylation and degradation were active 
at physiological rates, we profiled the ability of DUBs to rescue degradation of 
these substrates. We found that USP7 has a unique ability to broadly antagonize 
degradation. Together, we present an approach to identify DUB substrates and 
characterize DUB specificity that overcomes challenges posed by DUB redundancy.
