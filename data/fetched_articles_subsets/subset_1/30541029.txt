BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that breastfeeding benefits 
children's intelligence, possibly due to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 
(LC-PUFAs) present in breast milk. Under a nutritional adequacy hypothesis, an 
interaction between breastfeeding and genetic variants associated with 
endogenous LC-PUFAs synthesis might be expected. However, the literature on this 
topic is controversial.
METHODS: We investigated this gene × environment interaction through a 
collaborative effort. The primary analysis involved >12 000 individuals and used 
ever breastfeeding, FADS2 polymorphisms rs174575 and rs1535 coded assuming a 
recessive effect of the G allele, and intelligence quotient (IQ) in Z scores.
RESULTS: There was no strong evidence of interaction, with pooled 
covariate-adjusted interaction coefficients (i.e. difference between genetic 
groups of the difference in IQ Z scores comparing ever with never breastfed 
individuals) of 0.12[(95% confidence interval (CI): -0.19; 0.43] and 0.06 (95% 
CI: -0.16; 0.27) for the rs174575 and rs1535 variants, respectively. Secondary 
analyses corroborated these results. In studies with ≥5.85 and <5.85 months of 
breastfeeding duration, pooled estimates for the rs174575 variant were 0.50 (95% 
CI: -0.06; 1.06) and 0.14 (95% CI: -0.10; 0.38), respectively, and 0.27 (95% CI: 
-0.28; 0.82) and -0.01 (95% CI: -0.19; 0.16) for the rs1535 variant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not support an interaction between ever 
breastfeeding and FADS2 polymorphisms. However, subgroup analysis suggested that 
breastfeeding may supply LC-PUFAs requirements for cognitive development if 
breastfeeding lasts for some (currently unknown) time. Future studies in large 
individual-level datasets would allow properly powered subgroup analyses and 
further improve our understanding on the breastfeeding × FADS2 interaction.
