Over the last couple of decades, stimuli-responsive supramolecular gels 
comprising synthetic short peptides as building blocks have been explored for 
various biological and material applications. Though a wide range of stimuli has 
been tested depending on the structure of the peptides, light as a stimulus has 
attracted extensive attention due to its non-invasive, non-contaminant, and 
remotely controllable nature, precise spatial and temporal resolution, and 
wavelength tunability. The integration of molecular photo-switch and 
low-molecular-weight synthetic peptides may thus provide access to 
supramolecular self-assembled systems, notably supramolecular gels, which may be 
used to create dynamic, light-responsive "smart" materials with a variety of 
structures and functions. This short review summarizes the recent advancement in 
the area of light-sensitive peptide gelation. At first, a glimpse of commonly 
used molecular photo-switches is given, followed by a detailed description of 
their incorporation into peptide sequences to design light-responsive peptide 
gels and the mechanism of their action. Finally, the challenges and future 
perspectives for developing next-generation photo-responsive gels and materials 
are outlined.
