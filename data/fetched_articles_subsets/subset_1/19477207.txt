Myxoma virus (MV) is a highly lethal, rabbit-specific poxvirus that induces a 
disease called myxomatosis in European rabbits. In an effort to understand the 
function of predicted immunomodulatory genes we have deleted various viral genes 
from MV and tested the ability of these knockout viruses to induce lethal 
myxomatosis. MV encodes a unique 15 kD cytoplasmic protein (M130R) that is 
expressed late (12h post infection) during infection. M130R is a non-essential 
gene for MV replication in rabbit, monkey or human cell lines. Construction of a 
targeted gene knockout virus (vMyx130KO) and infection of susceptible rabbits 
demonstrate that the M130R knockout virus is attenuated and that loss of M130R 
expression allows the rabbit host immune system to effectively respond to and 
control the lethal effects of MV. M130R expression is a bona fide poxviral 
virulence factor necessary for full and lethal development of myxomatosis.
