Phytophthora sojae causes Phytophthora root and stem rot disease of soybean 
(Glycine max), leading to huge annual yield loss worldwide, but resistance to 
Phytophthora sojae (Rps) genes remains elusive. Soybean cultivar "Yudou 29" is 
resistant to P. sojae strain PsMC1, and this study aimed to clone, identify, and 
characterize the Rps gene in Yudou 29 (RpsYD29) and clarify its functional 
mechanism. We map-based cloned RpsYD29 (ZINC FINGER PROTEIN03, GmZFP03) using 
the families of a cross between Yudou 29 and a P. sojae-susceptible soybean 
cultivar "Jikedou 2". P. sojae resistance of GmZFP03 was functionally validated 
by stable soybean genetic transformation and allele-phenotype association 
analysis. GmZFP03 was identified as a C2H2-type zinc finger protein 
transcription factor, showing 4 amino acid residue polymorphisms (V79F, G122-, 
G123-, and D125V) and remarkably different expression patterns between resistant 
and susceptible soybeans. Notably boosted activity and gene expression of 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) in resistant-type GmZFP03-expressed transgenic 
soybean, substantial enhancement of P. sojae resistance of wild-type soybean by 
exogenous SOD treatment, and GmZFP03 binding to and activation of 2 SOD1 
(Glyma.03g242900 and Glyma.19g240400) promoters demonstrated the involvement of 
SOD1s in GmZFP03-mediated resistance to P. sojae strain PsMC1. Thus, this study 
cloned the soybean P. sojae-resistant GmZFP03, the product of which specifically 
targets 2 SOD1 promoters. GmZFP03 can be directly used for precise P. 
sojae-resistance soybean breeding.
