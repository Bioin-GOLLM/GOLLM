Many studies suggest that there are distinct regulatory processes controlling 
compound leaf development in different clades of legumes. Loss of function of 
the LEAFY (LFY) orthologs results in a reduction of leaf complexity to different 
degrees in inverted repeat-lacking clade (IRLC) and non-IRLC species. To further 
understand the role of LFY orthologs and the molecular mechanism in compound 
leaf development in non-IRLC plants, we studied leaf development in unifoliate 
leaf (un) mutant, a classical mutant of mungbean (Vigna radiata L.), which 
showed a complete conversion of compound leaves into simple leaves. Our analysis 
revealed that UN encoded the mungbean LFY ortholog (VrLFY) and played a 
significant role in leaf development. In situ RNA hybridization results showed 
that STM-like KNOXI genes were expressed in compound leaf primordia in mungbean. 
Furthermore, increased leaflet number in heptafoliate leaflets1 (hel1) mutants 
was demonstrated to depend on the function of VrLFY and KNOXI genes in mungbean. 
Our results suggested that HEL1 is a key factor coordinating distinct processes 
in the control of compound leaf development in mungbean and its related non-IRLC 
legumes.
