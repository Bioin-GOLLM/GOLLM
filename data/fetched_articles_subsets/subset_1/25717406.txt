Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a 
number of new genetic variants associated with breast cancer. However, the 
degree to which these genetic variants improve breast cancer diagnosis in 
concert with mammography remains unknown. We conducted a case-control study and 
collected mammography features and 77 genetic variants which reflect the state 
of the art GWAS findings on breast cancer. A na√Øve Bayes model was developed on 
the mammography features and these genetic variants. We observed that the 
incorporation of the genetic variants significantly improved breast cancer 
diagnosis based on mammographic findings.
