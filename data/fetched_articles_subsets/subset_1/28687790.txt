Skeletal complications are common features of neonatal-onset multisystem 
inflammatory disease (NOMID), a disorder caused by NLRP3-activating mutations. 
NOMID mice in which NLRP3 is activated globally exhibit several characteristics 
of the human disease, including systemic inflammation and cartilage dysplasia, 
but the mechanisms of skeletal manifestations remain unknown. In this study, we 
find that activation of NLRP3 in myeloid cells, but not mesenchymal cells 
triggers chronic inflammation, which ultimately, causes growth plate and 
epiphyseal dysplasia in mice. These responses are IL-1 signaling-dependent, but 
independent of PARP1, which also functions downstream of NLRP3 and regulates 
skeletal homeostasis. Mechanistically, inflammation causes severe anemia and 
hypoxia in the bone environment, yet down-regulates the HIF-1α pathway in 
chondrocytes, thereby promoting the demise of these cells. Thus, activation of 
NLRP3 in hematopoietic cells initiates IL-1β-driven paracrine cascades, which 
promote abnormal growth plate development in NOMID mice.
