BACKGROUND AND AIM: Some studies reported a positive link between familial 
Mediterranean fever (FMF) and epicardial adipose tissue. Our meta-analysis aimed 
to evaluate whether there is a significant association between FMF and increased 
epicardial adipose tissue thickness.
METHODS: We searched the following databases: PUBMED, WOS, OVID, SCOPUS, and 
EMBASE. Inclusion criteria were any original articles that reported epicardial 
adipose tissue in FMF patients with no age restriction, excluding reviews, case 
reports, editorials, animal studies, and non-English studies. Thirty eligible 
studies were screened full text but only five studies were suitable. We used 
RevMan software (5.4) for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The total number of patients included in the meta-analysis in the FMF 
patients group is 256 (mean age = 24.3), and the total number in the control 
group is 188 (mean age = 24.98). The pooled analysis between FMF patients and 
controls was [mean difference = 0.82 (95% CI = 0.25-1.39), p-value = 0.005]. We 
observed heterogeneity that was not solved by random effects (p > 0.00001). We 
performed leave one out test by removing the Kozan et al. study, and the 
heterogeneity was solved (p = 0.07), and the results were (MD = 0.98, 95% 
CI = 0.52-1.43, p-value < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: FMF patients are at increased risk of developing epicardial adipose 
tissue compared to controls. More multicenter studies with higher sample sizes 
are needed to support our results.
