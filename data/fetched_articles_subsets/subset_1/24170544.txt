PURPOSE: KRAS wild-type status is an imperfect predictor of sensitivity to 
anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies in colorectal cancer, motivating 
efforts to identify novel molecular aberrations driving RAS. This study aimed to 
build a quantitative readout of RAS pathway activity to (i) uncover molecular 
surrogates of RAS activity specific to colorectal cancer, (ii) improve the 
prediction of cetuximab response in patients, and (iii) suggest new treatment 
strategies.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A model of RAS pathway activity was trained in a large 
colorectal cancer dataset and validated in three independent colorectal cancer 
patient datasets. Novel molecular traits were inferred from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas colorectal cancer data. The ability of the RAS model to predict resistance 
to cetuximab was tested in mouse xenografts and three independent patient 
cohorts. Drug sensitivity correlations between our model and large cell line 
compendiums were performed.
RESULTS: The performance of the RAS model was remarkably robust across three 
validation datasets. (i) Our model confirmed the heterogeneity of the RAS 
phenotype in KRAS wild-type patients, and suggests novel molecular traits 
driving its phenotype (e.g., MED12 loss, FBXW7 mutation, MAP2K4 mutation). (ii) 
It improved the prediction of response and progression-free survival (HR, 2.0; P 
< 0.01) to cetuximab compared with KRAS mutation (xenograft and patient 
cohorts). (iii) Our model consistently predicted sensitivity to MAP-ERK kinase 
(MEK) inhibitors (P < 0.01) in two cell panel screens.
CONCLUSIONS: Modeling the RAS phenotype in colorectal cancer allows for the 
robust interrogation of RAS pathway activity across cell lines, xenografts, and 
patient cohorts. It demonstrates clinical utility in predicting response to 
anti-EGFR agents and MEK inhibitors.
