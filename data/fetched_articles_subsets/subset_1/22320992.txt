In Pakistani culture tobacco use is very high and a well known risk factor for 
developing head and neck cancer (HNC), tobacco smoke containing high quantities 
of chemical carcinogens such as aromatic amines and reactive oxygen species. 
OGG1 is the primary enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, 
responsible for the excision of 7, 8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, a mutagenic base 
byproduct that occurs as a result of exposure to reactive oxygen species. Groups 
of 300 already diagnosed HNC patients along with normal controls were included 
in this study. PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing 
were used to analyze the whole coding region of OGG1 gene. Sequence analysis 
revealed eight novel mutations (six missense and two frame shift mutations). 
Frequencies of missense mutations, Asp267Asn, Ser279Gly and Ile253Phe were 0.12, 
0.13 and 0.06 respectively. Frequencies of other missense mutations, 1578A> T, 
1582C> T and Ala399Glu (1542C> A) were 0.13, 0.13 and 0.16, whereas values for 
the frame shift mutations 1582insG and 1543-1544delCT were 0.13 and 0.16. In our 
study, incidence of these mutations was found higher in oral cancers (p<0.002) 
and in smokers (p<0.002) when compared with other sites of HNC and nonsmokers, 
respectively. Our finding suggests that these germline mutations in OGG1 gene 
contribute to risk of developing HNC.
