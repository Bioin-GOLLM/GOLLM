Because the incidence of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) has increased significantly 
during the last 10 years and it is recognized that Merkel cell polyomavirus 
(MCPyV) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation represent two different etiological 
inputs sharing clinical, histopathological, and prognostic similar features, 
although with different prognosis, this study investigated the detection of 
MCPyV in skin and lymph nodes with histological diagnosis of MCC. Formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) were retrieved from archived specimens and MCPyV 
non-coding control region (NCCR) and viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) sequences were 
amplified and sequenced. Results provide an interesting observation concerning 
the discrepancy between the MCPyV DNA status in primary and metastatic sites: in 
fact, in all cases in which primary and metastatic lesions were investigated, 
MCPyV DNA was detected only in the primary lesions. Our data further support the 
"hit-and-run" theory, also proposed by other authors, and may lead to 
speculation that in some MCCs the virus is only necessary for the process of 
tumor initiation and that further mutations may render the tumor independent 
from the virus. Few point mutations were detected in the NCCR and only silent 
mutations were observed in the VP1 sequence compared to the MCPyV MCC350 
isolate. To unequivocally establish a role of MCPyV in malignancies, additional 
well-controlled investigations are required, and larger cohorts should be 
examined.
