Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a global health issue. The unexpected nature of 
this devastating condition compounds the urgency of discovering methods for 
early detection of risk, which will lead to more effective prevention. However, 
the complex and dynamic nature of SCD continues to present a considerable 
challenge for the early identification of risk factors. Measurement of the left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is currently the only major risk factor 
used for stratification in clinical practice. Severely decreased LVEF is likely 
to manifest late in the natural history of SCD, however, and may only affect a 
small subgroup of patients who will suffer SCD. A growing body of literature 
describes novel risk markers and predictors of SCD, such as high-risk 
phenotypes, genetic variants and biomarkers. This Review will discuss the 
potential utility of these markers as early identifiers of risk, and suggests a 
framework for the conduct of future studies for the discovery, validation, and 
deployment of novel SCD risk factors.
