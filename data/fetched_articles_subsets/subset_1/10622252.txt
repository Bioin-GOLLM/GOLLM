Thiazolidinediones are a new class of antidiabetic agent that improve insulin 
sensitivity and reduce plasma glucose and blood pressure in subjects with type 2 
diabetes. Although these agents can bind and activate an orphan nuclear 
receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), there is 
no direct evidence to conclusively implicate this receptor in the regulation of 
mammalian glucose homeostasis. Here we report two different heterozygous 
mutations in the ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma in three subjects with 
severe insulin resistance. In the PPARgamma crystal structure, the mutations 
destabilize helix 12 which mediates transactivation. Consistent with this, both 
receptor mutants are markedly transcriptionally impaired and, moreover, are able 
to inhibit the action of coexpressed wild-type PPARgamma in a dominant negative 
manner. In addition to insulin resistance, all three subjects developed type 2 
diabetes mellitus and hypertension at an unusually early age. Our findings 
represent the first germline loss-of-function mutations in PPARgamma and provide 
compelling genetic evidence that this receptor is important in the control of 
insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis and blood pressure in man.
