Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy1,2 and promotes cardiometabolic 
health3. Loss of BAT during obesity and ageing is a principal hurdle for 
BAT-centred obesity therapies, but not much is known about BAT apoptosis. Here, 
untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that apoptotic brown adipocytes release a 
specific pattern of metabolites with purine metabolites being highly enriched. 
This apoptotic secretome enhances expression of the thermogenic programme in 
healthy adipocytes. This effect is mediated by the purine inosine that 
stimulates energy expenditure in brown adipocytes by the cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A signalling pathway. Treatment of mice 
with inosine increased BAT-dependent energy expenditure and induced 'browning' 
of white adipose tissue. Mechanistically, the equilibrative nucleoside 
transporter 1 (ENT1, SLC29A1) regulates inosine levels in BAT: ENT1-deficiency 
increases extracellular inosine levels and consequently enhances thermogenic 
adipocyte differentiation. In mice, pharmacological inhibition of ENT1 as well 
as global and adipose-specific ablation enhanced BAT activity and counteracted 
diet-induced obesity, respectively. In human brown adipocytes, knockdown or 
blockade of ENT1 increased extracellular inosine, which enhanced thermogenic 
capacity. Conversely, high ENT1 levels correlated with lower expression of the 
thermogenic marker UCP1 in human adipose tissues. Finally, the Ile216Thr loss of 
function mutation in human ENT1 was associated with significantly lower body 
mass index and 59% lower odds of obesity for individuals carrying the Thr 
variant. Our data identify inosine as a metabolite released during apoptosis 
with a 'replace me' signalling function that regulates thermogenic fat and 
counteracts obesity.
