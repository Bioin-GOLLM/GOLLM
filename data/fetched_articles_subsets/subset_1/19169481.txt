The apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome (AME) is a rare autosomal 
recessive disorder due to the deficiency of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
type 2 enzyme (11beta-HSD2). The 11beta-HSD2 enzyme, encoded by HSD11B2 gene, 
metabolizes active cortisol in cortisone. Mutations on HSD11B2 gene affect the 
enzyme activity by leading to an excess of cortisol, which causes its 
inappropriate access to mineralocorticoid receptor. Therefore, cortisol will 
bind mineralocorticoid receptor. The human HSD11B2 gene maps to chromosome 16q22 
and consists of five exons encoding a protein of 405 amino acids. We present 
here clinical and molecular studies on a Brazilian boy who was born pre-term 
after an oligodramnious pregnancy. He was diagnosed as having AME at the age of 
26 months. His parents are second cousins. Molecular characterization of the 
HSD11B2 gene revealed the homozygous mutation p.R186C. The patient described 
here is the second case of HDS11B2 gene mutation reported in Brazilian patients 
with AME.
