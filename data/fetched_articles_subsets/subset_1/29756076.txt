AIMS: The aim of the study was to compare the influence of gap junctional 
communication (GJC) in osteoclastogenesis from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral 
blood (PB) monocytes. These widely used sources differ in purity, since BM 
cultures contain a significant number of stromal cells. We studied whether 
stimulation of GJC in BM monocyte/stromal cell cultures differs from the effect 
in pure PB monocyte cultures. We compared the differentiation also in acidosis, 
which is a known inducer of bone resorption.
MAIN METHODS: Human BM and PB monocytes were isolated from BM aspirates or whole 
blood samples. The cells were cultured on human bone slices with 
osteoclastogenic growth factors and a GJC modulator, antiarrhythmic peptide 
AAP10, at physiological and acidic pH.
KEY FINDINGS: Both BM and PB monocytes differentiated into osteoclasts. Acidosis 
increased resorption in both cultures but stimulated cell fusion only in BM 
cultures, which demonstrates the role of stromal cells in osteoclastogenesis. At 
physiological pH, AAP10 increased the number of multinuclear cells and bone 
resorption in both BM and PB cultures indicating that GJC is involved in 
differentiation in both of these osteoclastogenesis assays. Interestingly, in PB 
cultures at pH 6.5 the stimulation of GJC with AAP10 inhibited both 
osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption suggesting a different role of GJC in BM 
and PB monocytes at stressed environment.
SIGNIFICANCE: The study is conducted with primary human tissue samples and adds 
new knowledge on factors affecting osteoclastogenesis from different monocyte 
sources.
