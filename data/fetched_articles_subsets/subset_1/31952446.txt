The interplay between active molecules and the protein environment in 
light-harvesting complexes tunes the photophysics and the dynamical properties 
of pigment-protein complexes in a subtle way, which is not fully understood. 
Here we characterized the photophysics and the ultrafast dynamics of four 
variants of the water-soluble chlorophyll protein (WSCP) as an ideal model 
system to study the behavior of strongly interacting chlorophylls. We found that 
when coordinated by the WSCP protein, the presence of the formyl group in 
chlorophyll b replacing the methyl group in chlorophyll a strongly affects the 
exciton energy and the dynamics of the system, opening up the possibility of 
tuning the photophysics and the transport properties of multichromophores by 
engineering specific interactions with the surroundings.
