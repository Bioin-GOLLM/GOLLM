In many synapses of the CNS, mobile zinc is packaged into glutamatergic vesicles 
and co-released with glutamate during neurotransmission. Following synaptic 
release, the mobilized zinc modulates ligand- and voltage-gated channels and 
receptors, functioning as an inhibitory neuromodulator. However, the origin and 
role of tonic, as opposed to phasically released, zinc are less well understood. 
We investigated tonic zinc in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), a zinc-rich, 
auditory brainstem nucleus. Our results show that application of a 
high-affinity, extracellular zinc chelator (ZX1) enhances spontaneous firing in 
DCN principal neurons (fusiform cells), consistent with inhibition of this 
neuronal property by tonic zinc. The enhancing effect was prevented by prior 
application of strychnine, a glycine receptor antagonist, suggesting that ZX1 
interferes with zinc-mediated modulation of spontaneous glycinergic inhibition. 
In particular, ZX1 decreased the amplitude and the frequency of glycinergic 
miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents in fusiform cells, from which we 
conclude that tonic zinc enhances glycinergic inhibitory neurotransmission. The 
observed zinc-mediated inhibition in spontaneous firing is present in mice 
lacking the vesicular zinc transporter (ZnT3), indicating that non-vesicular 
zinc inhibits spontaneous firing. Noise-induced increase in the spontaneous 
firing of fusiform cells is crucial for the induction of tinnitus. In this 
context, tonic zinc provides a powerful break of spontaneous firing that may 
protect against pathological run-up of spontaneous activity in the DCN.
