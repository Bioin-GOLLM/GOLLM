The guided entry of tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway, in which the Get3 
ATPase delivers an essential class of tail-anchored membrane proteins (TAs) to 
the Get1/2 receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum, provides a conserved mechanism 
for TA biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. The membrane-associated events of this 
pathway remain poorly understood. Here we show that complex assembly between the 
cytosolic domains (CDs) of Get1 and Get2 strongly enhances the affinity of the 
individual subunits for Get3•TA, thus enabling efficient capture of the 
targeting complex. In addition to the known role of Get1CD in remodeling Get3 
conformation, two molecular recognition features (MoRFs) in Get2CD induce Get3 
opening, and both subunits are required for optimal TA release from Get3. 
Mutation of the MoRFs attenuates TA insertion into the ER in vivo. Our results 
demonstrate extensive cooperation between the Get1/2 receptor subunits in the 
capture and remodeling of the targeting complex, and emphasize the role of MoRFs 
in receptor function during membrane protein biogenesis.
