Extensive genetic, biochemical, and histological evidence has implicated the 
amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and several 
mechanisms have been suggested, such as metal binding, reactive oxygen species 
production, and membrane pore formation. However, recent evidence argues for an 
additional role for signaling mediated by the amyloid precursor protein, APP, in 
part via the caspase cleavage of APP at aspartate 664. Here we review the 
effects and implications of this cleavage event, and propose a model of 
Alzheimer's disease that focuses on the critical nature of this cleavage and its 
downstream effects.
