Osteopontin (OPN) is a ubiquitously expressed protein with a wide range of 
physiological functions, including roles in bone mineralization, immune 
regulation, and wound healing. OPN has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
several forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD) where it promotes inflammation and 
fibrosis and regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism. OPN expression is 
increased in the kidneys, blood, and urine of patients with CKD, particularly in 
those with diabetic kidney disease and glomerulonephritis. The full-length OPN 
protein is cleaved by various proteases, including thrombin, matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, MMP-7, cathepsin-D, and plasmin, producing N-terminal 
OPN (ntOPN), which may have more detrimental effects in CKD. Studies suggest 
that OPN may serve as a biomarker in CKD, and while more research is needed to 
fully evaluate and validate OPN and ntOPN as CKD biomarkers, the available 
evidence suggests that they are promising candidates for further investigation. 
Targeting OPN may be a potential treatment strategy. Several studies show that 
inhibition of OPN expression or activity can attenuate kidney injury and improve 
kidney function. In addition to its effects on kidney function, OPN has been 
linked to cardiovascular disease, which is a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients with CKD.
