LNK is a member of the SH2B family of adaptor proteins and is a non-redundant 
regulator of cytokine signalling. Cytokines are secreted intercellular 
messengers that bind to specific receptors on the surface of target cells to 
activate the Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 
(JAK-STAT) signalling pathway. Activation of the JAK-STAT pathway leads to 
proliferative and often inflammatory effects, and so the amplitude and duration 
of signalling are tightly controlled. LNK binds phosphotyrosine residues to 
signalling proteins downstream of cytokines and constrains JAK-STAT signalling. 
Mutations in LNK have been identified in a range of haematological and 
inflammatory diseases due to increased signalling following the loss of LNK 
function. Here, we review the regulation of JAK-STAT signalling via the adaptor 
protein LNK and discuss the role of LNK in haematological diseases.
