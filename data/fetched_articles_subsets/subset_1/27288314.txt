Most human genes generate multiple protein isoforms through alternative pre-mRNA 
splicing, but the mechanisms controlling alternative splicing choices by RNA 
binding proteins are not well understood. These proteins can have multiple 
paralogs expressed in different cell types and exhibiting different splicing 
activities on target exons. We examined the paralogous polypyrimidine tract 
binding proteins PTBP1 and PTBP2 to understand how PTBP1 can exhibit greater 
splicing repression activity on certain exons. Using both an in vivo 
coexpression assay and an in vitro splicing assay, we show that PTBP1 is more 
repressive than PTBP2 per unit protein on a target exon. Constructing chimeras 
of PTBP1 and 2 to determine amino acid features that contribute to their 
differential activity, we find that multiple segments of PTBP1 increase the 
repressive activity of PTBP2. Notably, when either RRM1 of PTBP2 or the linker 
peptide separating RRM2 and RRM3 are replaced with the equivalent PTBP1 
sequences, the resulting chimeras are highly active for splicing repression. 
These segments are distinct from the known region of interaction for the PTBP1 
cofactors Raver1 and Matrin3 in RRM2. We find that RRM2 of PTBP1 also increases 
the repression activity of an otherwise PTBP2 sequence, and that this is 
potentially explained by stronger binding by Raver1. These results indicate that 
multiple features over the length of the two proteins affect their ability to 
repress an exon.
