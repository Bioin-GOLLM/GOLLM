INTRODUCTION: Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD and BMD) are allelic 
X-linked recessive muscle diseases caused by mutations in the large and complex 
dystrophin gene.
METHODS: We analyzed the dystrophin gene in 507 Korean DMD/BMD patients by 
multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification and direct sequencing.
RESULTS: Overall, 117 different deletions, 48 duplications, and 90 pathogenic 
sequence variations, including 30 novel variations, were identified. Deletions 
and duplications accounted for 65.4% and 13.3% of Korean dystrophinopathy, 
respectively, suggesting that the incidence of large rearrangements in 
dystrophin is similar among different ethnic groups. We also detected sequence 
variations in >100 probands. The small variations were dispersed across the 
whole gene, and 12.3% were nonsense mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: Precise genetic characterization in patients with DMD/BMD is timely 
and important for implementing nationwide registration systems and future 
molecular therapeutic trials in Korea and globally. Muscle Nerve 55: 727-734, 
2017.
