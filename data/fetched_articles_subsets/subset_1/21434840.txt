INTRODUCTION: Immunosuppressive drugs have a narrow therapeutic range and large 
inter-individual response variability. This has prompted pharmacogenetic 
studies, mostly with regard to their dose-concentration relationships, but also 
about proteins involved in their pharmacodynamics. Some polymorphisms of genes 
involved in their disposition pathways were shown to affect their 
dose-concentration relationships. The impact of pharmacogenetics on tissue 
distribution and the resulting clinical effects have less often been studied. 
More importantly, a few single nucleotide polymorphisms seem to have a 
significant impact on the incidence of acute rejection or the adverse effects of 
immunosuppressants. Environmental factors often interact with such 
genotype-phenotype relationships.
AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the impact of genetic polymorphisms of the 
metabolic enzymes, membrane transporters and target proteins of mycophenolic 
acid, calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors on 
clinical outcomes in kidney transplantation.
EXPERT OPINION: The current level of evidence is not yet high enough to 
recommend pharmacogenetic personalization of immunosuppressive regimens in 
transplant recipients. The prevention of cellular toxicity associated with local 
metabolism or transport, which cannot be addressed by routine monitoring, is 
worth investigating further.
