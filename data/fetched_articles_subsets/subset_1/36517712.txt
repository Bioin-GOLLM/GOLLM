The concept of immune privilege suggests that the central nervous system is 
isolated from the immune system. However, recent studies have highlighted the 
borders of the central nervous system as central sites of neuro-immune 
interactions. Although the nervous and immune systems both function to maintain 
homeostasis, under rare circumstances, they can develop pathological 
interactions that lead to neurological or psychiatric diseases. Here we discuss 
recent findings that dissect the key anatomical, cellular and molecular 
mechanisms that enable neuro-immune responses at the borders of the brain and 
spinal cord and the implications of these interactions for diseases of the 
central nervous system.
