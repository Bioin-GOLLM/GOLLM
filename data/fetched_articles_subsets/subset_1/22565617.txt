JAK2 (V617F) is associated with a genetic predisposition to its acquisition,as 
it is preferentially found in subjects with a common constitutional JAK2 
haplotype known as 46/1 or GGCC. A recent study suggests that a genetic 
predisposition to acquisition of MPL mutation may exist in sporadic patients, 
since an association was found with the JAK2 46/1 haplotype. We genotyped 509 
patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), 7% of which carrying a somatic 
mutation of MPL Exon 10. We found that the JAK2 GGCC haplotype was closely 
associated with JAK2 (V617F) (OR 1.84, P < 0.001) but not with MPL mutations (OR 
0.98), suggesting a different genetic background for these molecular lesions.
