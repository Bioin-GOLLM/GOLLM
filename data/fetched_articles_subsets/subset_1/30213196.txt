PURPOSE: Women with breast cancer report varying frequencies of cognitive 
problems during adjuvant systemic therapy. This variability suggests latent 
subgroups. Therefore, we identified latent subgroups of self-reported cognitive 
problems among postmenopausal women with and without breast cancer. We explored 
associations between membership in these subgroups and (a) demographic, 
clinical, and symptom characteristics and (b) variations in candidate gene 
polymorphisms.
METHODS: We evaluated frequency of cognitive problems using the Patient 
Assessment of Own Functioning Inventory. Growth mixture modeling identified 
latent subgroups over 18 months of adjuvant systemic therapy and at matched time 
points for women without cancer ( N = 331). We evaluated for differences among 
subgroups in demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics and in 41 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 candidate genes involved in DNA repair and 
oxidative stress pathways ( n = 199). We modeled associations between genotypes 
and subgroup membership using multinomial logistic regression.
RESULTS: We identified three latent subgroups: more frequent, persistent, and 
almost never. Receipt of chemotherapy plus anastrozole, depressive symptoms, and 
baseline neuropathic symptoms increased the odds of belonging to the more 
frequent subgroup. Anxiety and depressive symptoms increased the odds of 
belonging to the persistent subgroup. With covariates controlled for, carrying 
the ERCC5 rs873601 G minor allele increased the odds of reporting more frequent 
cognitive problems.
CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy plus anastrozole, depressive symptoms, and presence of 
neuropathic symptoms may predict more frequent cognitive problems during 
systemic therapy that later resolve. Mood dysregulation before therapy may 
predict persistent cognitive problems during therapy. ERCC5 genotype may 
influence frequency of cognitive problems after controlling for these risk 
factors.
