Mesenchymal tumors of the thyroid are extremely rare. Only few isolated cases of 
primary thyroid granular cell tumor (GrCT) have been reported. The anatomic 
location of this lesion plays an important role in the differential diagnosis. 
It is well-known that GrCT commonly involves the head-and-neck region, lower 
extremity, nuchal region, chest wall, and internal viscera such as the 
gastrointestinal tract. However, primary GrCT of the thyroid are unexpected and 
might lead to misdiagnosis, especially with pathological diagnosis limitations 
such as frozen section and fine-needle aspiration. We believe that it is 
important to establish a good differential diagnosis because of its ability to 
simulate the appearance of invasive carcinoma, especially in cases lacking 
tissue block examination. In this paper, we try to focus on clinical, 
radiological potential characteristics, and the differential diagnosis of the 
tumor.
