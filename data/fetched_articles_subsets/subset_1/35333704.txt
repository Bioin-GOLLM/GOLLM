Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are widely distributed in both Gram-negative and 
Gram-positive bacteria. PFTs can act as virulence factors that bacteria utilise 
in dissemination and host colonisation or, alternatively, they can be employed 
to compete with rival microbes in polymicrobial niches. PFTs transition from a 
soluble form to become membrane-embedded by undergoing large conformational 
changes. Once inserted, they perforate the membrane, causing uncontrolled efflux 
of ions and/or nutrients and dissipating the protonmotive force (PMF). In some 
instances, target cells intoxicated by PFTs display additional effects as part 
of the cellular response to pore formation. Significant progress has been made 
in the mechanistic description of pore formation for the different PFTs 
families, but in several cases a complete understanding of pore structure 
remains lacking. PFTs have evolved recognition mechanisms to bind specific 
receptors that define their host tropism, although this can be remarkably 
diverse even within the same family. Here we summarise the salient features of 
PFTs and highlight where additional research is necessary to fully understand 
the mechanism of pore formation by members of this diverse group of protein 
toxins.
