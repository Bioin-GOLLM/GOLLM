Dynamic profiling of changes in gene expression in response to stressors in 
specific microenvironments without requiring cellular destruction remains 
challenging. Current methodologies that seek to interrogate gene expression at a 
molecular level require sampling of cellular transcriptome and therefore lysis 
of the cell, preventing serial analysis of cellular transcriptome. To address 
this area of unmet need, we have recently developed a technology allowing 
transcriptomic analysis over time without cellular destruction. Our method, 
TRACE-seq (TRanscriptomic Analysis Captured in Extracellular vesicles using 
sequencing), is characterized by a cell-type specific transgene expression. It 
provides data on the transcriptome inside extracellular vesicles that provides 
an accurate representation of stress-responsive cellular transcriptomic changes. 
Thus, the transcriptome of cells expressing TRACE can be followed over time 
without destroying the source cell, which is a powerful tool for many fields of 
fundamental and translational biology research.
