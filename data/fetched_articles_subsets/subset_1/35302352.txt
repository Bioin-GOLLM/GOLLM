A challenge within the field of bioconjugation is developing probes to uncover 
novel information on proteins and other biomolecules. Intracellular delivery of 
these probes offers the promise of giving relevant context to this information, 
and these probes can serve as hypothesis-generating tools within complex 
systems. Leveraging the utility of triazabutadiene chemistry, herein, we discuss 
the development of a probe that undergoes reduction-mediated deprotection to 
rapidly deliver a benzene diazonium ion (BDI) into cells. The intracellular BDI 
resulted in an increase in global tyrosine phosphorylation levels. Seeing 
phosphatase dysregulation as a potential source of this increase, a tyrosine 
phosphatase (PTP1B) was tested and shown to be both inhibited and covalently 
modified by the BDI. In addition to the expected azobenzene formation at 
tyrosine side chains, key reactive histidine residues were also modified.
