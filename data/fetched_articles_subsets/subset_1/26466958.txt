In T cells, the Tec kinases IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) and resting 
lymphocyte kinase (RLK) are activated by TCR stimulation and are required for 
optimal downstream signaling. Studies of CD4(+) T cells from Itk(-/-) and 
Itk(-/-)Rlk(-/-) mice have indicated differential roles of ITK and RLK in Th1, 
Th2, and Th17 differentiation and cytokine production. However, these findings 
are confounded by the complex T cell developmental defects in these mice. In 
this study, we examine the consequences of ITK and RLK inhibition using a highly 
selective and potent small molecule covalent inhibitor PRN694. In vitro Th 
polarization experiments indicate that PRN694 is a potent inhibitor of Th1 and 
Th17 differentiation and cytokine production. Using a T cell adoptive transfer 
model of colitis, we find that in vivo administration of PRN694 markedly reduces 
disease progression, T cell infiltration into the intestinal lamina propria, and 
IFN-γ production by colitogenic CD4(+) T cells. Consistent with these findings, 
Th1 and Th17 cells differentiated in the presence of PRN694 show reduced 
P-selectin binding and impaired migration to CXCL11 and CCL20, respectively. 
Taken together, these data indicate that ITK plus RLK inhibition may have 
therapeutic potential in Th1-mediated inflammatory diseases.
