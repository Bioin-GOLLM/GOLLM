Tiling array and novel sequencing technologies have made available the 
transcription profile of the entire human genome. However, the extent of 
transcription and the function of genetic elements that occur outside of 
protein-coding genes, particularly those involved in disease, are still a matter 
of debate. In this review, we focus on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are 
involved in cancer. We define lncRNAs and present a cancer-oriented list of 
lncRNAs, list some tools (for example, public databases) that classify lncRNAs 
or that scan genome spans of interest to find whether known lncRNAs reside 
there, and describe some of the functions of lncRNAs and the possible genetic 
mechanisms that underlie lncRNA expression changes in cancer, as well as current 
and potential future applications of lncRNA research in the treatment of cancer.
