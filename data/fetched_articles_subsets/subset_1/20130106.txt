The SAP domain from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae THO1 protein contains a 
hydrophobic core and just two alpha-helices. It could provide a system for 
studying protein folding that bridges the gap between studies on isolated 
helices and those on larger protein domains. We have engineered the SAP domain 
for protein folding studies by inserting a tryptophan residue into the 
hydrophobic core (L31W) and solved its structure. The helical regions had a 
backbone root mean-squared deviation of 0.9 A from those of wild type. The 
mutation L31W destabilised wild type by 0.8 +/- 0.1 kcal mol(-1). The mutant 
folded in a reversible, apparent two-state manner with a microscopic folding 
rate constant of around 3700 s(-1) and is suitable for extended studies of 
folding.
