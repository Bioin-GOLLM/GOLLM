Giant ankyrin-B (ankB) is a neurospecific alternatively spliced variant of ANK2, 
a high-confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gene. We report that a mouse 
model for human ASD mutation of giant ankB exhibits increased axonal branching 
in cultured neurons with ectopic CNS axon connectivity, as well as with a 
transient increase in excitatory synapses during postnatal development. We 
elucidate a mechanism normally limiting axon branching, whereby giant ankB 
localizes to periodic axonal plasma membrane domains through L1 cell-adhesion 
molecule protein, where it couples microtubules to the plasma membrane and 
prevents microtubule entry into nascent axon branches. Giant ankB mutation or 
deficiency results in a dominantly inherited impairment in selected 
communicative and social behaviors combined with superior executive function. 
Thus, gain of axon branching due to giant ankB-deficiency/mutation is a 
candidate cellular mechanism to explain aberrant structural connectivity and 
penetrant behavioral consequences in mice as well as humans bearing ASD-related 
ANK2 mutations.
