Lactase persistence (LP) is a well-studied example of a Mendelian trait under 
selection in some human groups due to gene-culture coevolution. We investigated 
the frequencies of genetic variants linked to LP in Sudanese and South Sudanese 
populations. These populations have diverse subsistence patterns, and some are 
dependent on milk to various extents, not only from cows but also from other 
livestock such as camels and goats. We sequenced a 316-bp region involved in 
regulating the expression of the LCT gene on chromosome 2, which encompasses 
five polymorphisms that have been associated with LP. Pastoralist populations 
showed a higher frequency of LP-associated alleles compared with nonpastoralist 
groups, hinting at positive selection also among northeast African pastoralists. 
Among the LP variants, the -14009:G variant occurs at the highest frequency 
among the investigated populations, followed by the -13915:G variant, which is 
likely of Middle Eastern origin, consistent with Middle Eastern gene flow to the 
Sudanese populations. There was no incidence of the "East African" LP allele 
(-14010:C) in the Sudanese and South Sudanese groups, and only one heterozygous 
individual for the "European" LP allele (-13910:T), suggesting limited recent 
admixture from these geographic regions. The Beja population of the Beni Amer 
show three different LP variants at substantial and similar levels, resulting in 
one of the greatest aggregation of LP variants among all populations across the 
world.
