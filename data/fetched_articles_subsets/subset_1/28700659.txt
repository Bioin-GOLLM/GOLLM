Apoptosis plays a dual role in cancer development and malignancy. The role of 
apoptosis-related caspases in cancer remains controversial, particularly in oral 
tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC). In this study, we examined the protein 
levels of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 on tissue 
microarrays consisting of samples from 246 OTSCC patients by 
immunohistochemistry. Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that the protein 
levels of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 in tumor 
tissues were significantly higher compared to those in adjacent normal tissues 
(all p<0.001). The expression level of caspase-8 in tumors was elevated in 
patients with lymph node invasion. Moreover, positive expression of cleaved 
caspase-3 was associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in OTSCC 
patients with moderate differentiation and lymph node invasion. Combination of 
either positive cleaved caspase-3 or higher caspase-3 expression or both was 
associated with poor DFS. Interestingly, stratification analysis showed that 
co-expression levels of positive cleaved caspase-3 or/and higher caspase-3 were 
associated with better disease-specific survival in patients with advanced 
stages of the disease, such as large tumor size and lymph node invasion, whereas 
it was associated with poor DFS in OTSCC patients with moderate cell 
differentiation and small tumor size. Taken together, cleaved caspase-3 and 
caspase-3/8/9 could be biomarkers for tumorigenesis in OTSCC patients. The 
co-expression level of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-3 might be a prognostic 
biomarker for OTSCC patients, particular in those patients with certain tumor 
stages and cell differentiation status.
