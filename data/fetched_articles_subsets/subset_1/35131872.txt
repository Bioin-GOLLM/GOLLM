Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic cancer, and novel therapeutic 
options are crucial to improve overall survival. Here we provide evidence that 
impairment of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) can help control ovarian cancer 
progression, and this benefit correlates with expression of the two 
mitochondrial master regulators PGC1α and PGC1β. In orthotopic patient-derived 
ovarian cancer xenografts (OC-PDX), concomitant high expression of PGC1α and 
PGC1β (PGC1α/β) fostered a unique transcriptional signature, leading to 
increased mitochondrial abundance, enhanced tricarboxylic acid cycling, and 
elevated cellular respiration that ultimately conferred vulnerability to OXPHOS 
inhibition. Treatment with the respiratory chain complex I inhibitor IACS-010759 
caused mitochondrial swelling and ATP depletion that consequently delayed 
malignant progression and prolonged the lifespan of high PGC1α/β-expressing 
OC-PDX-bearing mice. Conversely, low PGC1α/β OC-PDXs were not affected by 
IACS-010759, thus pinpointing a selective antitumor effect of OXPHOS inhibition. 
The clinical relevance of these findings was substantiated by analysis of 
ovarian cancer patient datasets, which showed that 25% of all cases displayed 
high PGC1α/β expression along with an activated mitochondrial gene program. This 
study endorses the use of OXPHOS inhibitors to manage ovarian cancer and 
identifies the high expression of both PGC1α and β as biomarkers to refine the 
selection of patients likely to benefit most from this therapy.
SIGNIFICANCE: OXPHOS inhibition in ovarian cancer can exploit the metabolic 
vulnerabilities conferred by high PGC1α/β expression and offers an effective 
approach to manage patients on the basis of PGC1α/β expression.
