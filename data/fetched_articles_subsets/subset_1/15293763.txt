A 57-year-old woman first noticed difficulty in walking at the age of 34 years, 
and since then muscle wasting and weakness in the lower limbs and proximal 
portion of the upper limbs had progressed slowly. Serum CK was elevated. 
Immunohistochemical study of the biceps brachii muscle showed deficiency of 
dysferlin in sarcolemma, and the dysferlin gene analysis disclosed 3370 G-->T 
missense mutation. These findings led us to diagnose her as LGMD2B. Moreover 
echocardiogram revealed ventricular enlargement and diffuse hypokinesia 
suggesting secondary cardiomyopathy atributable to muscular dystrophy. Careful 
cardiac monitoring should be carried out in dysferlinopathy patients.
