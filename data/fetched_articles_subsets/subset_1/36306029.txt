Skin cancer has become increasingly common among young adults; however, this 
population does not consistently adhere to recommended methods for preventing 
the disease. Interventions in college settings have relied on appearance-focused 
appeals and have not been able to examine the cumulative effect of multiple 
behavior change and skin cancer risk communication strategies. The goal of the 
current study was to examine the unique and combined impacts of personalized 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation photographs, genetic testing for skin cancer risk, 
and general skin cancer prevention education. Participants were randomly 
assigned to one of four conditions: (1) skin cancer prevention education, (2) 
education + UV photo, (3) education + genetic testing, and (4) education + UV 
photo + genetic testing. Self-reported sun protection, tanning, and sunburn were 
assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 1 month 
post-intervention. The findings indicated benefits of the interventions to skin 
cancer prevention behaviors in the overall sample; however, the combined (UV 
photo + genetic testing) intervention had the most consistent positive effects 
on behaviors. Intervention effects were distinct across seasons. These results 
suggest that interventions containing multiple skin cancer risk communication 
strategies hold promise in benefitting health-promoting behavior changes in an 
at-risk, young adult population.Trial Registration Number: NCT03979872;
