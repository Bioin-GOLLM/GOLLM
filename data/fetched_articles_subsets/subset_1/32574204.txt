One of the determinants for tissue tropism of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is 
miR-122, a liver-specific microRNA. Recently, it has been reported that 
interaction of miR-122 to HCV RNA induces a conformational change of the 5'UTR 
internal ribosome entry site (IRES) structure to form stem-loop II structure 
(SLII) and hijack of translating 80S ribosome through the binding of SLIII to 
40S subunit, which leads to efficient translation. On the other hand, low levels 
of HCV-RNA replication have also been detected in some non-hepatic cells; 
however, the details of extrahepatic replication remain unknown. These 
observations suggest the possibility that miRNAs other than miR-122 can support 
efficient replication of HCV-RNA in non-hepatic cells. Here, we identified a 
number of such miRNAs and show that they could be divided into two groups: those 
that bind HCV-RNA at two locations (miR-122 binding sites I and II), in a manner 
similar to miR-122 (miR-122-like), and those that target a single site that 
bridges sites I and II and masking both G28 and C29 in the 5'UTR 
(non-miR-122-like). Although the enhancing activity of these non-hepatic miRNAs 
were lower than those of miR-122, substantial expression was detected in various 
normal tissues. Furthermore, structural modeling indicated that both 
miR-122-like and non-miR-122-like miRNAs not only can facilitate the formation 
of an HCV IRES SLII but also can stabilize IRES 3D structure in order to 
facilitate binding of SLIII to the ribosome. Together, these results suggest 
that HCV facilitates miR-122-independent replication in non-hepatic cells 
through recruitment of miRNAs other than miR-122. And our findings can provide a 
more detailed mechanism of miR-122-dependent enhancement of HCV-RNA translation 
by focusing on IRES tertiary structure.
