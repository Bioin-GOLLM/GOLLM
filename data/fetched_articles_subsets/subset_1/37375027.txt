Wickerhamomyces anomalus, previously known as Candida pelliculosa, occasionally 
causes candidemia in humans, primarily infecting neonates, and infants. The 
mortality rate of these invasive infections is high, and isolates with a reduced 
susceptibility to fluconazole have been reported. W. anomalus outbreaks are 
regularly reported in healthcare facilities, especially in neonatal intensive 
care units (NICUs). In order to rapidly genotype isolates with a 
high-resolution, we developed and applied a short tandem repeat (STR) typing 
scheme for W. anomalus. Six STR markers were selected and amplified in two 
multiplex PCRs, M3 and M6, respectively. In total, 90 W. anomalus isolates were 
typed, leading to the identification of 38 different genotypes. Four large 
clusters were found, unveiling simultaneous outbreak events spread across 
multiple units within the same hospital. STR typing results of 11 isolates were 
compared to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
calling, and the identified genotypic relationships were highly concordant. We 
performed antifungal susceptibility testing of these isolates, and a reduced 
susceptibility to fluconazole was found for two (2.3%) isolates. ERG11 genes of 
these two isolates were examined using WGS data, which revealed a novel I469L 
substitution in one isolate. By constructing a homology model for W. anomalus 
ERG11p, the substitution was found in close proximity to the fluconazole binding 
site. In summary, we showed multiple W. anomalus outbreak events by applying a 
novel STR genotyping scheme.
