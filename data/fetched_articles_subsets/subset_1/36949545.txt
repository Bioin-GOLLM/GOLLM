BACKGROUND: The human skin contains a diverse microbiome that provides 
protective functions against environmental pathogens. Studies have demonstrated 
that bacteriophages modulate bacterial community composition and facilitate the 
transfer of host-specific genes, potentially influencing host cellular 
functions. However, little is known about the human skin virome and its role in 
human health. Especially, how viral-host relationships influence skin microbiome 
structure and function is poorly understood.
RESULTS: Population dynamics and genetic diversity of bacteriophage communities 
in viral metagenomic data collected from three anatomical skin locations from 60 
subjects at five different time points revealed that cutaneous bacteriophage 
populations are mainly composed of tailed Caudovirales phages that carry 
auxiliary genes to help improve metabolic remodeling to increase bacterial host 
fitness through antimicrobial resistance. Sequence variation in the MRSA 
associated antimicrobial resistance gene, erm(C) was evaluated using targeted 
sequencing to further confirm the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes in 
the human virome and to demonstrate how functionality of such genes may 
influence persistence and in turn stabilization of bacterial host and their 
functions.
CONCLUSIONS: This large temporal study of human skin associated viruses 
indicates that the human skin virome is associated with auxiliary metabolic 
genes and antimicrobial resistance genes to help increase bacterial host 
fitness.
