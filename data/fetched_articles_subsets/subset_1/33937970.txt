BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with interactions between 
genetic and environmental factors. An increasing number of studies are 
demonstrating the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of 
psoriasis. miR-146a, a dominant negative regulator of inflammation, has been 
consistently reported as overexpressed in the skin and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with psoriasis. Expression and/or function 
of this miRNA is highly influenced by genetic variations, some of which have 
already been associated with susceptibility to psoriasis.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to study the importance of miR-146a in patients with 
moderate-to-severe psoriasis and to understand the impact of rs57095329 and 
rs2910164 polymorphisms in a psoriatic Portuguese population.
METHODS: miR-146a circulating levels were quantified using molecular biology 
techniques in 99 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (35 female, 64 male; 
age 47.4 ± 10.9 years) and 78 healthy individuals (52 female, 26 male; age 42.4 
± 10.1 years). miRNA expression was correlated with clinicopathological features 
as well as with genetic data such as the presence of human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-C*0602 allele and two miR-146a polymorphisms (rs2910164 and rs57095329).
RESULTS: miR-146a serum levels were 3.7-fold higher in patients with psoriasis 
than in controls (p < 0.0001, area under the curve [AUC] 0.75; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.66-0.83). Of note, miR-146a circulating levels positively 
correlated with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (p < 0.05) and body surface 
area (p < 0.05) indexes. No variations in miR-146a levels were observed with 
rs2910164 and rs57095329 genotypes.
CONCLUSION: Circulating miR-146a levels were upregulated in patients with 
psoriasis, especially in those with active disease. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the largest study with a homogenous psoriasis population, and 
our data could shed light on the pathogenesis of psoriasis, paving the way for 
new avenues for disease treatment.
