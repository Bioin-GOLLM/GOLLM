PURPOSE: Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody, is approved for the treatment of 
inflammatory diseases at doses that depend on the patient disease population. It 
was the aim of this study to evaluate its population pharmacokinetics in 
patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and characterize 
patient covariates that affect its disposition in this population.
METHODS: Information collected from 482 patients in two randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled international studies were analyzed using 
NONMEM.
RESULTS: A two-compartment, population pharmacokinetic model described the serum 
infliximab concentration-time data. Population pharmacokinetic estimates 
(typical value +/- standard error), based on the final covariate model, were 
clearance (CL: 0.407 +/- 0.0103 L/day), apparent volumes of distribution in the 
central (V(1): 3.29 +/- 0.0679 L) and peripheral (V(2): 4.13 +/- 0.16 L) 
compartments, and intercompartment clearance (Q: 7.14 +/- 0.489 L/day). 
Infliximab exhibited interindividual variability for CL and V(1) of 37.7% and 
22.1%, respectively. Infliximab t(1/2) is approximately 14 days. Covariate 
analysis showed that V(1) increased as body weight increased, and CL was higher 
in patients who developed antibodies to infliximab. An additional novel 
covariate, serum albumin concentration, was found to be inversely and strongly 
related to infliximab clearance in this population.
CONCLUSIONS: The disposition of infliximab in patients with moderately to 
severely active ulcerative colitis, unlike in rheumatoid arthritis, was not 
affected by coadministration of immunomodulators and corticosteroids but was 
related to formation of antibodies to infliximab and, notably, to serum albumin 
levels.
