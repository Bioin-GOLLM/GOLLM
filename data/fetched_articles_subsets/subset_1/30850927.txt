X-Linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) is a severe form of primary 
immunodeficiency characterized by absence of T cells and NK cells. X-SCID is 
caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the IL2RG gene that encodes common 
gamma chain (γc), which plays an essential role in lymphocyte development. We 
report the first case of hypomorphic X-SCID caused by a synonymous mutation in 
the IL2RG gene leading to a splice anomaly, in a family including two patients 
with diffuse cutaneous warts, recurrent molluscum contagiosum, and mild 
respiratory infections. The mutation caused aberrant splicing of IL2RG mRNA, 
subsequently resulted in reduced γc expression. The leaky production of normally 
spliced IL2RG mRNA produced undamaged protein; thus, T cells and NK cells were 
generated in the patients. Functional assays of the patients' T cells and NK 
cells revealed diminished cytokine response in the T cells and absent cytokine 
response in the NK cells. In addition, the TCR repertoire in these patients was 
limited. These data suggest that a fine balance between aberrant splicing and 
leaky production of normally spliced IL2RG mRNA resulted in late-onset combined 
immunodeficiency in these patients.
