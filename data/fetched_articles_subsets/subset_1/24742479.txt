BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hyperuricemia predicts a high risk for CKD 
progression but there is no large clinical trial in humans indicating that this 
relationship is causal in nature. The rs734553 single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) of the GLUT9 urate transporter gene was strongly associated with uric acid 
(UA) levels in a large meta-analysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This prospective study adopted 
the Mendelian randomization approach. The rs734553 SNP was used as an 
instrumental variable to investigate the relationship between UA and renal 
outcomes in a cohort of 755 patients with CKD who were enrolled between October 
18, 2005, and October 2, 2008. The association between the polymorphism and UA 
was preliminary confirmed in a series of 211 healthy volunteers enrolled between 
January 1, 2001, and July 12, 2011, from the same geographic area as the 
patients with CKD. The study end point was a composite renal-end point (i.e., 
>30% decrease in the GFR, dialysis, or transplantation). Patients were followed 
up for a median of 36 months.
RESULTS: In healthy individuals, serum UA levels were highest in homozygotes for 
the T allele (risk allele), intermediate in heterozygotes for the same allele, 
and lowest in those without the risk allele (P<0.001), but no such relationship 
was found in patients with CKD. In the CKD cohort, homozygotes (TT) and 
heterozygotes (GT) for the risk allele had a 2.35 times higher risk (hazard 
ratio, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 4.42; P=0.008) of CKD progression. 
The risk for CKD progression by rs734553 remained unmodified in analyses 
adjusting for proteinuria, GFR, and other classical and CKD-peculiar risk 
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: A GLUT9 polymorphism, which is strongly associated with serum UA 
levels in healthy individuals of the general population with normal renal 
function, holds a strong predictive power for CKD progression. These findings 
are compatible with the hypothesis that the link between UA and CKD progression 
is causal in nature.
