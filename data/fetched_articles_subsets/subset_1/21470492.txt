OBJECTIVES: The role of various polymorphisms located in the IL-18 promoter has 
not yet been defined with regards to patient susceptibility to SLE, and 
occurrence of clinical manifestations of the disease remains inconsistent.
METHODS: Using PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing analysis we studied the frequency of 
-137 G/C (rs187238), -607 C/A (rs1946518) and -1297C/T (rs360719) polymorphisms 
in IL-18 promoter in patients with SLE from a sample of the Polish population.
RESULTS: We observed that patients with SLE bearing the IL-18 -1297CC genotype 
exhibited a 2.536-fold increased risk of SLE incidence (95% CI=1.333-4.826, 
p=0.0035). We also found a significantly higher frequency of the IL-18 -1297C 
allele in patients than in controls, with odds ratio (OR) for the IL-18 -1297C 
allele in patients with SLE being 1.558 (95% CI=1.189-2.041, p=0.0013). 
Moreover, there was an association between the IL-18 -1297CC genotype and renal 
manifestations of SLE, OR=3.792 (1.446-9.947, p=0.0051). However, we did not 
find any contribution of the IL-18 -607 C/A and -137 G/C polymorphisms to SLE 
incidence or occurrence of the studied SLE manifestations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed that the IL-18 -1297C gene variant may 
contribute to the risk of SLE incidence. Moreover, IL-18 -1297CC might be 
associated with renal manifestations of SLE.
