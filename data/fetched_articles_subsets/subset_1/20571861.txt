Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for various 
infections in humans and animals. It causes localized and systemic infections, 
such as abscesses, impetigo, cellulitis, sepsis, endocarditis, bone infections, 
and meningitis. S. aureus virulence factors responsible for the initial contact 
with host cells (MSCRAMMs-microbial surface components recognizing adhesive 
matrix molecules) include three Sdr proteins. The presence of particular sdr 
genes is correlated with putative tissue specificity. The transcriptional 
organization of the sdr region remains unclear. We tested expression of the 
sdrC, sdrD, or sdrE genes in various in vitro conditions, as well as after 
contact with human blood. In this work, we present data suggesting a separation 
of the sdr region into three transcriptional units, based on their differential 
reactions to the environment. Differential reaction of the sdrD transcript to 
environmental conditions and blood suggests dissimilar functions of the sdr 
genes. SdrE has been previously proposed to play role in bone infections, whilst 
our results can indicate that sdrD plays a role in the interactions between the 
pathogen and human immune system, serum or specifically reacts to 
nutrients/other factors present in human blood.
