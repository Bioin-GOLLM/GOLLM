Meconium ileus is most often associated with mutations in the CFTR gene; however 
recently, mutations in GUCY2C in the Bedouin population have also been shown to 
result in this phenotype. This gene codes for an intestinal transmembrane 
receptor that generates cyclic GMP, which activates cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane receptor. We report a third family that supports the association 
of variants in the GUCY2C gene with meconium ileus (MI). A Lebanese kindred was 
studied and individuals affected with MI had either homozygous or compound 
heterozygous variants in GUCY2C. The earliest manifestation of the affected 
individuals was the presence of second trimester fetal echogenic bowel, thus 
resulting in the expansion of the differential diagnosis of this ultrasound 
finding.
