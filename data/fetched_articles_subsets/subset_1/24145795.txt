A series of novel ligustrazine-benzoic acid derivatives were synthesized and 
evaluated for their protective effect against cobalt chloride-induced 
neurotoxicity in differentiated PC12 cells. Combining hematoxylin and eosin 
staining, we found compound that (3,5,6-trimethylpyrazin-2-yl)methyl 
3-methoxy-4-[(3,5,6-trimethylpyrazin-2-yl)methoxy]benzoate (4a) displayed 
promising protective effect on the proliferation of the injured PC12 cells (EC50 
= 4.249 µM). Structure-activity relationships are brieﬂy discussed.
