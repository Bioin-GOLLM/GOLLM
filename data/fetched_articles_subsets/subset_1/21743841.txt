Murine models have been utilized with increasing frequency mainly due to 
availability of genetically engineered models. With advancement in high spatial 
and temporal resolution, echocardiography is used extensively for the evaluation 
of cardiovascular function in murine models of cardiovascular disease. This 
review summarizes the general applications and methods involved in 
echocardiography used to study mouse models for cardiovascular research, based 
on 20 years of experience in our laboratory. The goal of this article is to 
provide a practical guide to the use of echo techniques in mice to evaluate 
cardiac systolic and diastolic function.
