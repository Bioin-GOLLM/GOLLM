BACKGROUND: To determine the clinical benefits of systemic targeted agents 
across multiple histologies after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain 
metastases.
METHODS: Between 2000 and 2013, 737 patients underwent upfront SRS for brain 
metastases. Patients were stratified by whether or not they received targeted 
agents with SRS. 167 (23%) received targeted agents compared to 570 (77%) that 
received other available treatment options. Time to event data were summarized 
using Kaplan-Meier plots, and the log rank test was used to determine 
statistical differences between groups.
RESULTS: Patients who received SRS with targeted agents vs those that did not 
had improved overall survival (65% vs. 30% at 12 months, p < 0.0001), improved 
freedom from local failure (94% vs 90% at 12 months, p = 0.06), improved distant 
failure-free survival (32% vs. 18% at 12 months, p = 0.0001) and improved 
freedom from whole brain radiation (88% vs. 77% at 12 months, p = 0.03). 
Improvement in freedom from local failure was driven by improvements seen in 
breast cancer (100% vs 92% at 12 months, p < 0.01), and renal cell cancer (100% 
vs 88%, p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis revealed that use of targeted agents 
improved all cause mortality (HR = 0.6, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted agent use with SRS appears to improve survival and 
intracranial outcomes.
