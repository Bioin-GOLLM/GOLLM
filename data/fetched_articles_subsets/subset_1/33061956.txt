BACKGROUND: It is pretty well known that DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are 
actively involved in abnormal cell growth. The goal of the current study is to 
explore the correlation between DNMT expression and colorectal adenomatous 
polyps (CAPs).
METHOD: Twenty pairs of CAP samples with a diameter ≥ 10 mm and corresponding 
normal colorectal mucosa (NCM) tissues from patients were used in the present 
study. The expression levels and activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) were 
measured in the CAP tissues. The global methylation and the promoter methylation 
level of 3 kinds of tumour suppressor gene were detected.
RESULTS: mRNA and protein levels of DNMT3B were found to be elevated in the CAP 
tissues compared with the control tissue. Additionally, the methylation of long 
interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1/L1) was decreased in the CAP tissue. 
Furthermore, methylation of the promoter of a tumour suppressor gene Ras 
association domain family 1A (RASSF1A) was increased in the CAP tissues, while 
the mRNA levels of RASSF1A were decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the overexpression of DNMT3B may 
contribute to a role in the genesis of CAPs through the hypomethylation of 
chromosomes in the whole cell and promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A.
