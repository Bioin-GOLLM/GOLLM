OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the associated biological effects of 
radio-frequency (RF) exposure at 16 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on mice 
health.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 48 healthy 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were 
investigated. A 16 T high static magnetic field (HiSMF) was generated by a 
superconducting magnet, and a radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic field for 
hydrogen resonance at 16 T (700 MHz) was transmitted via a homemade RF system. 
The mice were exposed inside the 16 T HiSMF with the 700 MHz RF field for 
60 min, and the body weight, organ coefficients, histomorphology of major 
organs, and blood indices were analyzed for the basal state of the mice on day 0 
and day 14. The Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), and 
interleukin- 6 (IL-6) were used to evaluate the thermal effects on the brain. 
Locomotor activity, the open field test, tail suspension test, forced swimming 
test, and grip strength test were used to assess the behavioral characteristics 
of the mice.
RESULTS: The 16 T HiSMF with 700 MHz RF electromagnetic field exposure had no 
significant effects on body weight, organ coefficients, or histomorphology of 
major organs in the mice. On day 0, the expressions of HSP70 and COX2 in the 
brain were increased by 16 T HiSMF with 700 MHz RF electromagnetic field 
exposure. However, the expression of HSP70, COX2, and IL-6 had no significant 
difference compared with the sham group on day 14. Compared with the sham 
groups, the meancorpuscularvolume (MCV) on day 0 and the total protein (TP) on 
day 14 were increased significantly, whereas the other blood indices did not 
change significantly. The 16 T HiSMF with 700 MHz RF electromagnetic field 
exposure caused the mice to briefly circle tightly but had no effect on other 
behavioral indicators.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, 16 T HiSMF with 700 MHz RF electromagnetic field 
exposure for 60 min did not have severe effects on mice.
