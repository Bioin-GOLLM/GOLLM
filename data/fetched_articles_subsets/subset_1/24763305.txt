OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively evaluate the association of ERCC1 C8092A and 
ERCC2 Lys751Gln polymorphisms with the risk of glioma.
METHODS: Potential studies were searched and selected through the 
Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) 
platforms, WanFang and VIP database up to June 2013. Two investigators 
independently reviewed full text and included studies met inclusion criteria. 
Combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were 
calculated in a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model according to 
results of heterogeneity test. All analyses were performed by Revman 5.2 and 
Stata 10.0 software.
RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were included in our meta-analysis, including 
3,580 glioma patients and 4,728 controls. Overall, ERCC1 C8092A polymorphism was 
associated with the risk of glioma (AA vs. CC: OR = 1.29, 95%CI: 1.07-1.55, 
P = 0.01; recessive model: OR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.07-1.55, P = 0.01). When 
stratified by ethnicity, significant association was only observed in the 
Chinese population (AA vs. CC: OR = 1.37, 95%CI: 1.03-1.81, P = 0.03; recessive 
model: OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02-1.75, P = 0.04). For ERCC2 Lys751Gln 
polymorphism, no significant association was found between ERCC2 Lys751Gln 
polymorphism and the risk of glioma in different genetic models. A significant 
association of ERCC2 Lys751Gln polymorphism with the risk of glioma was 
identified in the Caucasian population under recessive model (OR = 0.87; 95% CI: 
0.78-0.98, P = 0.02), but not in the Chinese population.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested that the AA genotype of ERCC1 C8092A 
polymorphism might increase the susceptibility of glioma in the Chinese 
population. And the TT genotype of ERCC2 Lys751Gln polymorphism may decrease the 
risk of glioma in the Caucasian population. But the small number of studies and 
moderate methodological quality require cautious interpretation of the study 
results.
