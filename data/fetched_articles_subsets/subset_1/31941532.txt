BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects ~â€‰1% of live births and is 
the most common birth defect. Although the genetic contribution to the CHD has 
been long suspected, it has only been well established recently. De novo 
variants are estimated to contribute to approximately 8% of sporadic CHD.
METHODS: CHD is genetically heterogeneous, making pathway enrichment analysis an 
effective approach to explore and statistically validate CHD-associated genes. 
In this study, we performed novel gene and pathway enrichment analyses of 
high-impact de novo variants in the recently published whole-exome sequencing 
(WES) data generated from a cohort of CHD 2645 parent-offspring trios to 
identify new CHD-causing candidate genes and mutations. We performed rigorous 
variant- and gene-level filtrations to identify potentially damaging variants, 
followed by enrichment analyses and gene prioritization.
RESULTS: Our analyses revealed 23 novel genes that are likely to cause CHD, 
including HSP90AA1, ROCK2, IQGAP1, and CHD4, and sharing biological functions, 
pathways, molecular interactions, and properties with known CHD-causing genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultimately, these findings suggest novel genes that are likely to 
be contributing to CHD pathogenesis.
