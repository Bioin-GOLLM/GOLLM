OBJECTIVE: To investigate several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 
insulin receptor (INSR) gene that have significant associations with 
pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a Korean population.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: University-based hospital.
PATIENT(S): 134 patients with PCOS and 100 healthy women as controls.
INTERVENTION(S): All exons of INSR in DNA samples from 100 healthy women and 134 
women with PCOS were sequenced and compared.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Frequencies of genotypes for several SNPs in INSR gene 
that were found as specifically expressed SNPs in a Korean population.
RESULT(S): Among nine SNPs analyzed in a large population, the genotypic 
frequencies of eight SNPs were similar, and they had no statistically 
significant association with PCOS. However, the frequency of a minor allele for 
one novel SNP, +176477 C>T, was higher in the control group than the patient 
group.
CONCLUSION(S): Among the analyzed SNPs, +176477 C>T, a novel SNP in the INSR 
gene, was associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS in a Korean population.
