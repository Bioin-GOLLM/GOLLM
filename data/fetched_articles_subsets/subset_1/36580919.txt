Tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells are a subset of memory T cells that 
play a critical role in limiting early pathogen spread and controlling 
infection. TRM cells exhibit differences across tissues, but their potential 
heterogeneity among distinct anatomic compartments within the small intestine 
and colon has not been well recognized. Here, by analyzing TRM cells from the 
lamina propria and epithelial compartments of the small intestine and colon, we 
showed that intestinal TRM cells exhibited distinctive patterns of cytokine and 
granzyme expression along with substantial transcriptional, epigenetic, and 
functional heterogeneity. The T-box transcription factor Eomes, which represses 
TRM cell formation in some tissues, exhibited unexpected context-specific 
regulatory roles in supporting the maintenance of established TRM cells in the 
small intestine, but not in the colon. Taken together, these data provide 
previously unappreciated insights into the heterogeneity and differential 
requirements for the formation vs. maintenance of intestinal TRM cells.
