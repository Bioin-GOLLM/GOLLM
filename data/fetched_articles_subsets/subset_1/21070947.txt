Following budding, HIV-1 virions undergo a maturation process where the Gag 
polyprotein in the immature virus is cleaved by the viral protease and 
rearranges to form the mature infectious virion. Despite the wealth of 
structures of isolated capsid domains and an in vitro-assembled mature lattice, 
models of the immature lattice do not provide an unambiguous model of 
capsid-molecule orientation and no structural information is available for the 
capsid maturation pathway. Here we have applied hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass 
spectrometry to immature, mature, and mutant Gag particles (CA5) blocked at the 
final Gag cleavage event to examine the molecular basis of capsid assembly and 
maturation. Capsid packing arrangements were very similar for all virions, 
whereas immature and CA5 virions contained an additional intermolecular 
interaction at the hexameric, 3-fold axis. Additionally, the N-terminal 
β-hairpin was observed to form as a result of capsid-SP1 cleavage rather than 
driving maturation as previously postulated.
