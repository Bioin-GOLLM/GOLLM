Multiple loss-of-function mutations in TRIAD3 (a.k.a. RNF216) have recently been 
identified in patients suffering from Gordon Holmes syndrome (GHS), 
characterized by cognitive decline, dementia, and movement disorders. TRIAD3A is 
an E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes and facilitates the ubiquitination of its 
target for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Here, we 
demonstrate that two of these missense substitutions in TRIAD3 (R660C and R694C) 
could not regulate the degradation of their neuronal target, activity-regulated 
cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc/Arg 3.1), whose expression is critical for 
synaptic plasticity and memory. The synaptic deficits due to the loss of 
endogenous TRIAD3A could not be rescued by TRIAD3A harboring GHS-associated 
missense mutations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the loss of endogenous TRIAD3A 
in the mouse hippocampal CA1 region led to deficits in spatial learning and 
memory. Finally, we show that these missense mutations abolished the interaction 
of TRIAD3A with Arc, disrupting Arc ubiquitination, and consequently Arc 
degradation. Our current findings of Arc misregulation by TRIAD3A variants 
suggest that loss-of-function mutations in TRIAD3A may contribute to dementia 
observed in patients with GHS driven by dysfunctional UPS components, leading to 
cognitive impairments through the synaptic protein Arc.
