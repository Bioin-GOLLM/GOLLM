AIM: To determine the association of gap junction protein alpha 3 (GJA3) gene 
tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with susceptibility to age-related 
cataract (ARC).
METHODS: In total, 486 ARC patients were matched with 500 healthy controls. All 
the participants underwent complete ophthalmic examinations. Haplotype-tagging 
SNPs of GJA3 gene were selected from the HapMap Beijing Han Chinese population. 
Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes of all the 
subjects. Under three different genetic models: dominant, recessive, and 
additive, the association between SNPs and ARC was examined. After adjusting for 
age and sex, the genetic effects of the GJA3 SNPs were evaluated with logistic 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: Four tag GJA3 SNPs (rs6490519, rs9506430, rs9509053, and rs9552089) 
were included in the present study. None of the SNPs showed a significant 
relationship with an altered risk of total ARC under the dominant, recessive, or 
additive models. In the subgroup analysis, rs9506430 had a significant effect on 
the formation of a posterior subcapsular cataract (P=0.002, OR: 0.227, 95%CI: 
0.088-0.590) under the recessive model.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that GJA3 variants may influence the development 
of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Further studies need to be designed to 
confirm this possibility.
