BACKGROUND: In some reports, serum ferritin (SF) has been associated with 
insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: We studied non-Hispanic whites without diabetes mellitus in a 
postscreening examination. Participants included cases [HFE C282Y homozygosity; 
and transferrin saturation (TS) >50% and SF >300 μg/L (males) and TS >45% and SF 
>200 μg/dL (females), regardless of HFE genotype] and controls [HFE wild-type 
(wt/wt) and TS/SF 25th-75th percentiles]. We excluded participants with 
overnight fasts <8 hr, cirrhosis, hepatitis B or C, pregnancy, or missing data. 
Observations were age, sex, C282Y homozygosity, body mass index (BMI), systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP), lymphocytes, alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP), TS, SF, and 
glucose/insulin. Insulin resistance was defined as homeostasis model assessment 
of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) 4th quartile (≥2.70).
RESULTS: A total of 407 women and 362 men (mean age 54 years) included 188 C282Y 
homozygotes and 371 wt/wt. Significant trends across HOMA-IR quartiles included 
age, male sex, BMI, SBP, DBP, lymphocytes, ALT, CRP >0.5 mg/dL (positive), and 
TS (negative). Multiple regression on HOMA-IR revealed significant associations 
with male sex, BMI, SBP, lymphocytes, ALT, CRP>0.5 mg/dL (positive), and DBP and 
SF (negative). Logistic regression on HOMA-IR 4th quartile revealed significant 
positive associations with age, male sex, BMI, and lymphocytes. Metabolic 
syndrome occurred in 53 participants (6.9%). Logistic regression on metabolic 
syndrome revealed these odds ratios: HOMA-IR 4th quartile [9.1 (4.8, 17.3)] and 
CRP >0.5 mg/dL [2.9 (1.6, 5.4)].
CONCLUSIONS: Age, male sex, BMI, and lymphocytes were positively associated with 
HOMA-IR after correction for other factors. HOMA-IR 4th quartile and CRP 
>0.5 mg/dL predicted metabolic syndrome.
