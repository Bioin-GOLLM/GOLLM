Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in crop plants remain largely unexplored. 
Here, we provide a protocol for identifying PPIs in potato (Solanum tuberosum) 
using TurboID-mediated proximity labeling. We transiently expressed constructs 
for a nucleus-located transcription factor and a plasma membrane-localized 
receptor-like kinase fused to TurboID to identify PPIs in potato leaves. We 
describe the plasmid construction, plant material, agroinfiltration, biotin 
treatment, protein isolation, free biotin removal, western blot analysis, and 
enrichment of biotinylated proteins for mass spectrometry analysis.
