Previously, we reported five common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 
-624G>C, -396G>A, -358A>C, -341C>G, and -294T>C, and six common haplotypes 
(CGACT, GAACT, GGAGC, GGACC, CAACT, and GAACC) in the 5'-flanking region of the 
SULT1A1 gene that were associated with altered enzymatic activity. In the 
present study, we performed in vitro assays to determine the functional impact 
of these genetic variations on the promoter activity. Dual luciferase reporter 
assays revealed that these SNPs are located in a negative regulatory fragment of 
the SULT1A1 gene. Further experiments demonstrated that these SNPs and 
haplotypes affected promoter activities of SULT1A1. Electrophoretic mobility 
shift assays showed distinctive binding patterns for the SNPs -396G>A and 
-294T>C, due to differential binding affinities of the G/A alleles and the T/C 
alleles to nuclear proteins extracted from the liver carcinoma cell lines, HepG2 
and Huh7.
