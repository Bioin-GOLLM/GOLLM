Designing therapeutic and sensor materials to diagnose and eliminate bacterial 
infections remains a significant challenge for active theragnostic nanoprobes. 
In the present work, fluorescent/electroactive poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT 
nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized with quaternary ammonium salts using 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), (CTAB-P3HT NPs) were prepared using a 
simple mini-emulsion method. The morphology, spectroscopic properties and 
electronic properties of CTAB-P3HT NPs were characterized by DLS, zeta 
potential, SEM, TEM, UV-vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectroscopy and 
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In an aqueous solution, CTAB-P3HT 
NPs were revealed to be uniformly sized, highly fluorescent and present a highly 
positively charged NP surface with good electroactivity. Dual detection was 
demonstrated as the binding of the bacteria to NPs could be observed by 
fluorescence quenching as well as by the changes in EIS. Binding of E. coli to 
CTAB-P3HT NPs was demonstrated and LODs of 5 CFU/mL and 250 CFU/mL were obtained 
by relying on the fluorescence spectroscopy and EIS, respectively. The 
antimicrobial activity of CTAB-P3HT NPs on bacteria and fungi was also studied 
under dark and nutritive conditions. An MIC and an MBC of 2.5 µg/mL were 
obtained with E. coli and with S. aureus, and of 0.312 µg/mL with C. albicans. 
Additionally a good biocompatibility toward normal human cells (WI38) was 
observed, which opens the way to their possible use as a therapeutic agent.
