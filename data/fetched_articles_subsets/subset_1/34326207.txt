Bacteriophage predation selects for diverse antiphage systems that frequently 
cluster on mobilizable defense islands in bacterial genomes. However, molecular 
insight into the reciprocal dynamics of phage-bacterial adaptations in nature is 
lacking, particularly in clinical contexts where there is need to inform phage 
therapy efforts and to understand how phages drive pathogen evolution. Using 
time-shift experiments, we uncovered fluctuations in Vibrio cholerae's 
resistance to phages in clinical samples. We mapped phage resistance 
determinants to SXT integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), which 
notoriously also confer antibiotic resistance. We found that SXT ICEs, which are 
widespread in γ-proteobacteria, invariably encode phage defense systems 
localized to a single hotspot of genetic exchange. We identified mechanisms that 
allow phage to counter SXT-mediated defense in clinical samples, and document 
the selection of a novel phage-encoded defense inhibitor. Phage infection 
stimulates high-frequency SXT ICE conjugation, leading to the concurrent 
dissemination of phage and antibiotic resistances.
