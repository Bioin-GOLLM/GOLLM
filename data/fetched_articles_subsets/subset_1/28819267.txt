The inheritance modes of pathogenic missense mutations are known to be highly 
associated with protein structures; recessive mutations are mainly observed in 
the buried region of protein structures, whereas dominant mutations are 
significantly enriched in the interfaces of molecular interactions. However, the 
differences in phenotypic impacts among various dominant mutations observed in 
individuals are not fully understood. In the present study, the functional 
effects of pathogenic missense mutations on three-dimensional macromolecular 
complex structures were explored in terms of dominant mutation types, namely, 
haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative, or toxic gain-of-function. The major 
types of dominant mutation were significantly associated with the different 
types of molecular interactions, such as protein-DNA, homo-oligomerization, or 
intramolecular domain-domain interactions, affected by mutations. The 
dominant-negative mutations were biased toward molecular interfaces for cognate 
protein or DNA. The haploinsufficiency mutations were enriched on the DNA 
interfaces. The gain-of-function mutations were localized to domain-domain 
interfaces. Our results demonstrate a novel use of macromolecular complex 
structures for predicting the disease-causing mechanisms through inheritance 
modes.
