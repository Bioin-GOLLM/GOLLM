Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive 
inherited disease caused by the mutation of the FBP1 gene, the incidence is 
estimated to be between 1/350,000 and 1/900,000. The symptoms of affected 
individuals are non-specific and are easily confused with other metabolic 
disorders. The present study describes the clinical features of four Chinese 
pediatric patients who presented with hypoglycemia, hyperlactacidemia, metabolic 
acidosis, and hyperuricemia. Targeted-next generation sequencing using the 
Agilent SureSelect XT Inherited Disease Panel was used to screen for causal 
variants in the genome, and the clinically-relevant variants were subsequently 
verified using Sanger sequencing. Here, DNA sequencing identified six variations 
of the FBP1 gene (NM_000507.3) in the four patients. In Case 1, we found a 
compound heterozygous mutations of c.704delC (p.Pro235GlnfsX42) (novel) and 
c.960_961insG (p.Ser321Valfs) (known pathogenic). In Case 2, we found a compound 
heterozygous mutations of c.825 + 1G>A and c.960_961insG (both were known 
pathogenically). In Case 3, a homozygous missense mutation of c.355G>A 
(p.Asp119Asn) (reported in ClinVar database without functional study) was found. 
Case 4 had a compound heterozygous mutations c.720_729del (p.Tyr241GlyfsX33) 
(novel) and c.490G>A (p.Gly164Ser) (known pathogenically). Further in vitro 
studies in the COS-7cell line demonstrated that the mutation of ASP119ASN had no 
impact on protein expression, but decreased the enzyme activity, and with which 
the clinical significance of Asp119Asn can be determined to be likely 
pathogenic. This report not only expands upon the known spectrum of variation of 
the FBP1 gene, but also deepens our understanding of the clinical features of 
FBPase deficiency.
