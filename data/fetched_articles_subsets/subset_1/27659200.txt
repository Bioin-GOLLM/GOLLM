Host prion (PrPC) genotype is a major determinant for the susceptibility to 
prion diseases. The Q/K222-PrPC polymorphic variant provides goats and mice with 
high resistance against classical scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
(BSE); yet its effect against atypical scrapie is unknown. Here, transgenic mice 
expressing the goat wild-type (wt) or the K222-PrPC variant were intracerebrally 
inoculated with several natural cases of atypical scrapie from sheep and goat 
and their susceptibility to the prion disease was determined. Goat wt and 
K222-PrPC transgenic mice were 100% susceptible to all the atypical scrapie 
isolates, showing similar survival times and almost identical disease 
phenotypes. The capacity of the K222-PrPC variant to replicate specifically the 
atypical scrapie strain as efficiently as the goat wt PrPC, but not the 
classical scrapie or cattle-BSE as previously reported, further suggests the 
involvement of concrete areas of the host PrPC in the strain-dependent 
replication of prions.
