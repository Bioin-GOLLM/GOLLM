The importance of molecular chaperones in cancer is well established, yet 
several chaperone inhibitors have failed in clinical trials due to toxicity. 
Recent efforts have focused on targeting chaperone function in cancer by either 
manipulating the "chaperone code" or inhibiting helper cochaperones, such as 
DNAJA1. Tong etÂ al. identify a novel inhibitor that specifically disrupts 
DNAJA1's interaction with p53, promoting p53 degradation. This finding 
highlights specific DNAJA1 interactions with the potential for less toxicity 
compared to traditional chaperone inhibitors.
