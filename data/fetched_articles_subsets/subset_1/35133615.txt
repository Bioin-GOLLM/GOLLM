PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Liquid biopsies, including circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), 
can inform a variety of clinical questions. This review examines the potential 
role of ctDNA as a clinical tool to inform clinical decision-making from early 
to late stage cutaneous melanoma.
RECENT FINDINGS: In pre-clinical studies, ctDNA has been shown to detect minimal 
residual disease and molecular relapse; predict and monitor response to therapy; 
and identify key resistance mechanisms. Here, we examine the potential utility 
of ctDNA and discuss its limitations for use in patients with melanoma. We 
present novel clinical trials, which are testing its value as a tool to augment 
clinical decision-making. Finally, we discuss the steps that are needed to 
ensure that ctDNA is used optimally in order to improve outcomes for patients 
with melanoma. Preclinical studies have shown that ctDNA has huge potential to 
provide real-time information about disease status in patients with melanoma. It 
is now time to test it rigorously within clinical trials to assess how it can be 
optimally used to benefit patients in the clinic.
