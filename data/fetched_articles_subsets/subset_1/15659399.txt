System L amino acid transporters mediate the movement of bulky neutral amino 
acids across cell membranes. Until now three proteins that induce system L 
activity have been identified: LAT1, LAT2, and LAT3. The former two proteins 
belong to the solute carrier family 7 (SLC7), whereas the latter belongs to 
SLC43. In the present study we present a new cDNA, designated LAT4, which also 
mediates system L activity when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Human LAT4 
exhibits 57% identity to human LAT3. Like LAT3, the amino acid transport 
activity induced by LAT4 is sodium-, chloride- and pH-independent, is not 
trans-stimulated, and shows two kinetic components. The low affinity component 
of LAT4 induced activity is sensitive to the sulfhydryl-specific reagent 
N-ethylmaleimide but not that with high affinity. Mutation in LAT4 of the SLC43 
conserved serine 297 to alanine abolishes sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide. LAT4 
activity is detected at the basolateral membrane of PCT kidney cells. In situ 
hybridization experiments show that LAT4 mRNA is restricted to the epithelial 
cells of the distal tubule and the collecting duct in the kidney. In the 
intestine, LAT4 is mainly present in the cells of the crypt.
