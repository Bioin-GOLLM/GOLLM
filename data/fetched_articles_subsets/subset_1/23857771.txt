Centriole duplication begins with the formation of a single procentriole next to 
a preexisting centriole. CPAP (centrosomal protein 4.1-associated protein) was 
previously reported to participate in centriole elongation. Here, we show that 
CEP120 is a cell cycle-regulated protein that directly interacts with CPAP and 
is required for centriole duplication. CEP120 levels increased gradually from 
early S to G2/M and decreased significantly after mitosis. Forced overexpression 
of either CEP120 or CPAP not only induced the assembly of overly long centrioles 
but also produced atypical supernumerary centrioles that grew from these long 
centrioles. Depletion of CEP120 inhibited CPAP-induced centriole elongation and 
vice versa, implying that these proteins work together to regulate centriole 
elongation. Furthermore, CEP120 was found to contain an N-terminal 
microtubule-binding domain, a C-terminal dimerization domain, and a centriolar 
localization domain. Overexpression of a microtubule binding-defective 
CEP120-K76A mutant significantly suppressed the formation of elongated 
centrioles. Together, our results indicate that CEP120 is a CPAP-interacting 
protein that positively regulates centriole elongation.
