Currently there are no viable treatment options for patients with debilitating 
inherited retinal degeneration. The vast variability in disease-inducing 
mutations and resulting phenotypes has hampered the development of therapeutic 
interventions. Gene therapy is a logical approach, and recent work has focused 
on ways to optimize vector design and packaging to promote optimized expression 
and phenotypic rescue after intraocular delivery. In this review, we discuss 
ongoing ocular clinical trials, which currently use viral gene delivery, but 
focus primarily on new advancements in optimizing the efficacy of non-viral gene 
delivery for ocular diseases. Non-viral delivery systems are highly 
customizable, allowing functionalization to improve cellular and nuclear uptake, 
bypassing cellular degradative machinery, and improving gene expression in the 
nucleus. Non-viral vectors often yield transgene expression levels lower than 
viral counterparts, however their favorable safety/immune profiles and large DNA 
capacity (critical for the delivery of large ocular disease genes) make their 
further development a research priority. Recent work on particle coating and 
vector engineering presents exciting ways to overcome limitations of 
transient/low gene expression levels, but also highlights the fact that further 
refinements are needed before use in the clinic.
