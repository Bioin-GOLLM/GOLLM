Bone-marrow transplantation is an effective cell therapy but requires 
myeloablation, which increases infection risk and mortality. Recent 
lineage-tracing studies documenting that resident macrophage populations 
self-maintain independently of haematological progenitors prompted us to 
consider organ-targeted, cell-specific therapy. Here, using 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor-Î²-deficient 
(Csf2rb(-/-)) mice that develop a myeloid cell disorder identical to hereditary 
pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (hPAP) in children with CSF2RA or CSF2RB 
mutations, we show that pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMT) of either 
wild-type or Csf2rb-gene-corrected macrophages without myeloablation was safe 
and well-tolerated and that one administration corrected the lung disease, 
secondary systemic manifestations and normalized disease-related biomarkers, and 
prevented disease-specific mortality. PMT-derived alveolar macrophages persisted 
for at least one year as did therapeutic effects. Our findings identify 
mechanisms regulating alveolar macrophage population size in health and disease, 
indicate that GM-CSF is required for phenotypic determination of alveolar 
macrophages, and support translation of PMT as the first specific therapy for 
children with hPAP.
