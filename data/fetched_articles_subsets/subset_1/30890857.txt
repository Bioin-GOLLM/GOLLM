BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the association of eNOS 
polymorphisms with risk of Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease (LCPD).
METHODS: The study comprised of 45 LCPD patients and 55 controls. The eNOS 
polymorphisms were genotyped with PCR and by PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: The eNOS 894G > T and -786T > C polymorphisms were significantly 
associated with an increased risk of LCPD. However, there was no significant 
association between eNOS 27-bp VNTR polymorphism and LCPD risk.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the eNOS 894G > T and -786T > C 
polymorphisms may be a risk factor for LCPD in Iranian children, but not 27-bp 
VNTR polymorphism.
