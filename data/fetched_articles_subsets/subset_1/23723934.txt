In the title salt, C8H12N(+)·C7H5O3 (-), the cation is disordered over two 
orientations with site occupancies of 0.565 (7) and 0.435 (7). In the anion, the 
carboxyl-ate group makes the dihedral angle of 4.19 (18)° with the benzene ring. 
In the crystal, the ions are connected by N-H⋯O and O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, 
forming a three-dimensional network.
