BACKGROUND: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized 
by symptoms of thrombocytopenia and bleeding due to production of autoantibodies 
against platelets. Recently, the occurrence of polymorphisms has been identified 
as one of the main causes of disease onset.
METHODS: To conduct this study, we recruited 140 patients and control 
individuals with no history of platelet loss. After collection of specimens, the 
prevalence of interferon-γ polymorphism was evaluated using the allele-specific 
oligonucleotide-polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) technique and confirmed by 
sequencing techniques.
RESULTS: The results showed that the frequency of the AA genotype was higher in 
the control group, compared with patients with ITP; however, in the acute and 
chronic groups, the frequency of the AT genotype was higher than that of the AA 
genotype. We also discovered that there was no significant correlation between 
platelet counts before and after treatment, nor in its related parameters with 
interferon (IFN)-γ polymorphism.
CONCLUSION: rs2430561 does not seem to have any role in ITP pathogenesis and 
treatment response.
