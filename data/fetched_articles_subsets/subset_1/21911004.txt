In mammals, interleukin-21 (IL-21) is an immunomodulatory cytokine with 
pleiotropic effects on the proliferation, differentiation and effector functions 
of T, B, NK and dendritic cells. A cDNA encoding the chicken orthologue of IL-21 
(chIL-21) was cloned by RT-PCR from RNA isolated from activated chicken 
splenocytes and consists of 438 nucleotides, encoding an open reading frame of 
145 amino acids (aa). Chicken IL-21 has 20-30% aa identity to its orthologues in 
mammals, Xenopus and fish, but is more highly conserved within Aves (50-80%). 
The four alpha-helical bundle structure of mammalian IL-21 appears to be 
conserved in the predicted chicken protein, as are the four cysteine residues 
required for the formation of two disulphide bridges. A glutamine residue in aa 
position 129, which has been implicated in the binding of IL-21 to the IL-2 
receptor γ-chain in mammals, is also conserved. ChIL-21 is expressed in most 
lymphoid tissues, predominantly by CD4+ TCRαβ+ T cells. As in mammals, chIL-21 
synergistically enhances T-cell proliferation and inhibits maturation of 
dendritic cells.
