BACKGROUND: The mitochondrial genomes of higher plants vary remarkably in size, 
structure and sequence content, as demonstrated by the accumulation and activity 
of repetitive DNA sequences. Incompatibility between mitochondrial genome and 
nuclear genome leads to non-functional male reproductive organs and results in 
cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). CMS has been used to produce F1 hybrid seeds 
in a variety of plant species.
RESULTS: Here we compared the mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of Gossypium 
hirsutum sterile male lines CMS-2074A and CMS-2074S, as well as their restorer 
and maintainer lines. First, we noticed the mitogenome organization and 
sequences were conserved in these lines. Second, we discovered the mitogenomes 
of 2074A and 2074S underwent large-scale substitutions and rearrangements. 
Actually, there were five and six unique chimeric open reading frames (ORFs) in 
2074A and 2074S, respectively, which were derived from the recombination between 
unique repetitive sequences and nearby functional genes. Third, we found out 
four chimeric ORFs that were differentially transcribed in sterile line (2074A) 
and fertile-restored line.
CONCLUSIONS: These four novel and recombinant ORFs are potential candidates that 
confer CMS character in 2074A. In addition, our observations suggest that CMS in 
cotton is associated with the accelerated rates of rearrangement, and that novel 
expression products are derived from recombinant ORFs.
