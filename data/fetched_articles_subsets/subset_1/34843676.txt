Constitutively activated BCR-ABL kinase is considered the driver event 
responsible in the initiation and development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). 
The advent of the first BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib has significantly improved 
the clinical outcome of CML cases. However, resistance to imatinib occurs in 
25-30% of CML patients. Due to the lack of effective therapeutic strategies, 
novel treatment approaches are urgently required for imatinib-resistant CML. 
Simvastatin, a well-known HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that confers tremendous 
clinical benefits in cardiovascular diseases, has attracted mounting attentions 
for its potent antitumor effects on multiple tumor types. In this study, we 
demonstrated that simvastatin monotherapy was effective in diminishing cell 
viability in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells, including 
T351I mutated cells, with the latter being less vulnerable to the simvastatin 
than the former. Notably, we found that simvastatin acted as a robust cytotoxic 
sensitizer of imatinib to kill imatinib-resistant and T315I mutated CML cells in 
vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the cooperative interaction of simvastatin 
and imatinib was associated with the inactivation of the PI3K/Akt signaling 
pathway, which was a classical downstream pro-survival cascade of the BCR-ABL 
kinase. In addition, this drug combination obviously decreased Myc expression 
through attenuation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and increased H3K27 
trimethylation. Taken together, we provide attractive preclinical results for 
the combinatorial regimen of simvastatin and imatinib against imatinib-resistant 
and T315I mutated CML cells. This combined regimens warrants further clinical 
investigations in patients with imatinib-resistant CML.
