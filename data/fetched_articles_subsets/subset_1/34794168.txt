All life forms defend their genome against DNA invasion. Eukaryotic cells 
recognize incoming DNA and limit its transcription through repressive chromatin 
modifications. The human silencing hub (HUSH) complex transcriptionally 
represses long interspersed element-1 retrotransposons (L1s) and retroviruses 
through histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3)1-3. How HUSH recognizes and 
initiates silencing of these invading genetic elements is unknown. Here we show 
that HUSH is able to recognize and transcriptionally repress a broad range of 
long, intronless transgenes. Intron insertion into HUSH-repressed transgenes 
counteracts repression, even in the absence of intron splicing. HUSH binds 
transcripts from the target locus, prior to and independent of H3K9me3 
deposition, and target transcription is essential for both initiation and 
propagation of HUSH-mediated H3K9me3. Genomic data reveal how HUSH binds and 
represses a subset of endogenous intronless genes generated through 
retrotransposition of cellular mRNAs. Thus intronless cDNA-the hallmark of 
reverse transcription-provides a versatile way to distinguish invading 
retroelements from host genes and enables HUSH to protect the genome from 
'non-self' DNA, despite there being no previous exposure to the invading 
element. Our findings reveal the existence of a transcription-dependent 
genome-surveillance system and explain how it provides immediate protection 
against newly acquired elements while avoiding inappropriate repression of host 
genes.
