MerTK is a tyrosine kinase receptor that belongs to the TAM (Tyro3/Axl/Mer) 
receptor family. It is involved in different processes including cellular 
proliferation/survival, cellular adhesion/migration, and release of the 
inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines. Although it is reported that MERTK 
polymorphisms affect the severity of viral and metabolic liver diseases, being 
able to influence fibrosis progression and hepatocellular carcinoma development, 
the mechanisms remain unknown.
METHODS: using a microarray approach, we evaluated the liver expression of genes 
involved in fibrogenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis in patient with chronic 
hepatitis C (CHC), stratified for MERTK genotype and MERTK expression.
RESULTS: we found that the rs 4374383 AA homozygosity is associated with lower 
MERTK expression in CHC patients and that, depending on MERTK genotype, Matrix 
Metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), Matrix Metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7), Secreted Frizzled 
Related Protein 1 (SFRP1) and WNT gene family 11(WNT11) show differential 
expression in patients with CHC with or without neoplastic progression.
CONCLUSIONS: our results confirm that MERTK represents a genetic biomarker for 
progression of liver disease and are suggestive of translational relevance for 
the study of downstream pathways involved in fibrogenesis and 
hepatocarcinogenesis.
