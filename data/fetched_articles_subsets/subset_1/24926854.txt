Despite extensive effort, only a few chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD)-associated genes have been suggested, indicating that there must be 
additional risk-associated loci. Here we aimed to identify additional 
COPD-associated SNPs and to explore the potential relationship between COPD 
subgroups and the SNPs in the Korean population. We performed a genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) with 990 Korean individuals; 102 COPD cases and 544 
controls for GWAS using Affymetrix SNP array 5.0, and 173 COPD cases and 171 
controls for replication. After validating the candidate single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP), we performed subgroup analysis by disease phenotype. 
Through GWAS, we identified a novel SNP in the phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D) gene 
[rs16878037 (C>T), p = 1.66 ◊ 10(-6)] that was significantly associated with 
COPD. This signal in PDE4D was successfully replicated in the independent set (p 
= 0.041). When we combined the discovery and replication data, the association 
signal became more significant (p = 5.69 ◊ 10(-7)). In the COPD subgroup 
analysis, the T allele of rs16878037 was significantly more frequent in COPD 
patients without severe diffusion capacity impairment (mild mixed and 
obstruction-dominant group) than in patients with severe impairment (severe 
mixed and emphysema-dominant groups). This result supports that PDE4D 
polymorphisms might be involved in the susceptibility to COPD especially in 
non-emphysematous individuals and that they could also affect the responsiveness 
of the PDE4 inhibitor treatment.
