Purpose:RUNX1-mutated (RUNX1mut) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with 
adverse outcome, highlighting the urgent need for a better genetic 
characterization of this AML subgroup and for the design of efficient 
therapeutic strategies for this disease. Toward this goal, we further dissected 
the mutational spectrum and gene expression profile of RUNX1mut AML and 
correlated these results to drug sensitivity to identify novel compounds 
targeting this AML subgroup.Experimental Design: RNA-sequencing of 47 RUNX1mut 
primary AML specimens was performed and sequencing results were compared to 
those of RUNX1 wild-type samples. Chemical screens were also conducted using 
RUNX1mut specimens to identify compounds selectively affecting the viability of 
RUNX1mut AML.Results: We show that samples with no remaining RUNX1 wild-type 
allele are clinically and genetically distinct and display a more homogeneous 
gene expression profile. Chemical screening revealed that most RUNX1mut 
specimens are sensitive to glucocorticoids (GCs) and we confirmed that GCs 
inhibit AML cell proliferation through their interaction with the glucocorticoid 
receptor (GR). We observed that specimens harboring RUNX1 mutations expected to 
result in low residual RUNX1 activity are most sensitive to GCs, and that 
coassociating mutations as well as GR levels contribute to GC sensitivity. 
Accordingly, acquired glucocorticoid sensitivity was achieved by negatively 
regulating RUNX1 expression in human AML cells.Conclusions: Our findings show 
the profound impact of RUNX1 allele dosage on gene expression profile and 
glucocorticoid sensitivity in AML, thereby opening opportunities for preclinical 
testing which may lead to drug repurposing and improved disease 
characterization. Clin Cancer Res; 23(22); 6969-81. ©2017 AACR.
