INTRODUCTION: Pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome 
is a rare autosomal dominant disease that usually presents in childhood with 
recurrent sterile arthritis. As the child ages into puberty, cutaneous features 
develop and arthritis subsides. We report the case of a now 25-year-old male 
patient with PAPA syndrome with the E250K mutation in PSTPIP1. We also present a 
systematic literature review of other PAPA cases.
METHOD: We conducted a literature search of PubMed using the following search 
terms: E250K mutation, PSTPIP1, and PAPA.
RESULTS: PAPA syndrome is caused by mutations on chromosome 15q affecting the 
proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) gene, also 
known as CD2-binding protein 1 (CD2BP1). The reported cases of PAPA syndrome 
currently in the literature involve mutations in A230T and E250Q. One case of a 
novel E250K mutation has been reported, which presented with a different 
phenotype to previously described cases of PAPA syndrome.
CONCLUSION: With variation present between disease presentations from case to 
case, it is possible that the spectrum of PAPA syndrome is wider than currently 
thought. Further research is needed which may uncover an as-yet undiscovered 
genetic abnormality linking these interrelated diseases together.
