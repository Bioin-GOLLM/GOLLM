AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to assess the interaction between 
melatonin receptor 1B gene (MTNR1B) rs10830963 polymorphism and lifestyle 
intervention during pregnancy on occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus 
(GDM) in high-risk women.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the randomised controlled gestational 
diabetes prevention trial 'RADIEL', conducted between 2008 and 2014 in four 
maternity hospitals in southern Finland. A total of 226 women with a history of 
GDM and/or a pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) were enrolled at <20 weeks of 
gestation (mean 13 weeks) and randomised into an intervention group receiving 
counselling on diet, physical activity and weight control and a control group 
receiving standard antenatal care. The main outcome was incidence of GDM, 
defined as one or more pathological glucose values in a standard 75 g 2-h OGTT. 
The MTNR1B rs10830963 was genotyped for further analyses.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the genotype distribution 
between the intervention and the control group. A significant interaction was 
observed between the rs10830963 genotypes and the lifestyle intervention on 
age-adjusted occurrence of gestational diabetes (p = 0.038). Among women 
homozygous for the C allele of rs10830963, the OR for GDM was significantly 
lower in the intervention group than in the control group (OR 0.16 [95% CI 0.03, 
0.85], p = 0.014). This difference was not seen in women heterozygous (OR 0.88 
[95% CI 0.32, 2.41], p = 0.798) or homozygous (OR 2.25 [95% CI 0.34, 14.69], 
p = 0.384) for the risk allele G.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In women at high risk of GDM, only those not 
carrying the risk allele G benefited from the lifestyle intervention. Our 
results indicate that certain genetic risk variants may modify the effectiveness 
of lifestyle interventions. This may provide important information when planning 
GDM prevention studies in the future.
