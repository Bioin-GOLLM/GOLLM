The roles and regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis (a non-apoptotic form of cell 
death) in cancer remain unclear. The tumour suppressor BRCA1-associated protein 
1 (BAP1) encodes a nuclear deubiquitinating enzyme to reduce histone 2A 
ubiquitination (H2Aub) on chromatin. Here, integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic 
and cancer genomic analyses link BAP1 to metabolism-related biological 
processes, and identify cystine transporter SLC7A11 as a key BAP1 target gene in 
human cancers. Functional studies reveal that BAP1 decreases H2Aub occupancy on 
the SLC7A11 promoter and represses SLC7A11 expression in a 
deubiquitinating-dependent manner, and that BAP1 inhibits cystine uptake by 
repressing SLC7A11 expression, leading to elevated lipid peroxidation and 
ferroptosis. Furthermore, we show that BAP1 inhibits tumour development partly 
through SLC7A11 and ferroptosis, and that cancer-associated BAP1 mutants lose 
their abilities to repress SLC7A11 and to promote ferroptosis. Together, our 
results uncover a previously unappreciated epigenetic mechanism coupling 
ferroptosis to tumour suppression.
