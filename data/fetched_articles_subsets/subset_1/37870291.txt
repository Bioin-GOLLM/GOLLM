BACKGROUND AND AIMS: NAFLD is the most common form of liver disease worldwide, 
but only a subset of individuals with NAFLD may progress to NASH. While NASH is 
an important etiology of HCC, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the 
conversion of NAFLD to NASH and then to HCC are poorly understood. We aimed to 
identify genetic risk genes that drive NASH and NASH-related HCC.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: We searched genetic alleles among the 24 most significant 
alleles associated with body fat distribution from a genome-wide association 
study of 344,369 individuals and validated the top allele in 3 independent 
cohorts of American and European patients (N=1380) with NAFLD/NASH/HCC. We 
identified an rs3747579-TT variant significantly associated with NASH-related 
HCC and demonstrated that rs3747579 is expression quantitative trait loci of a 
mitochondrial DnaJ Heat Shock Protein Family (Hsp40) Member A3 ( DNAJA3 ). We 
also found that rs3747579-TT and a previously identified PNPLA3 as a functional 
variant of NAFLD to have significant additional interactions with NASH/HCC risk. 
Patients with HCC with rs3747579-TT had a reduced expression of DNAJA3 and had 
an unfavorable prognosis. Furthermore, mice with hepatocyte-specific Dnaja3 
depletion developed NASH-dependent HCC either spontaneously under a normal diet 
or enhanced by diethylnitrosamine. Dnaja3 -deficient mice developed NASH/HCC 
characterized by significant mitochondrial dysfunction, which was accompanied by 
excessive lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses. The molecular features 
of NASH/HCC in the Dnaja3 -deficient mice were closely associated with human 
NASH/HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: We uncovered a genetic basis of DNAJA3 as a key player of 
NASH-related HCC.
