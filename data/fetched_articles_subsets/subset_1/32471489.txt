BACKGROUND: Chronic tissue injury was shown to induce progressive scarring in 
fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), while an array of 
repair/regeneration and stress responses come to equilibrium to determine the 
outcome of injury at the organ level. In the lung, type I alveolar epithelial 
(ATI) cells constitute the epithelial barrier, while type II alveolar epithelial 
(ATII) cells play a pivotal role in regenerating the injured distal lungs. It 
had been demonstrated that eukaryotic cells possess repair machinery that can 
quickly patch the damaged plasma membrane after injury, and our previous studies 
discovered the membrane-mending role of Tripartite motif containing 72 (TRIM72) 
that expresses in a limited number of tissues including the lung. Nevertheless, 
the role of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) repair in the pathogenesis of IPF has 
not been examined yet.
METHOD: In this study, we tested the specific roles of TRIM72 in the repair of 
ATII cells and the development of lung fibrosis. The role of membrane repair was 
accessed by saponin assay on isolated primary ATII cells and rat ATII cell line. 
The anti-fibrotic potential of TRIM72 was tested with bleomycin-treated 
transgenic mice.
RESULTS: We showed that TRIM72 was upregulated following various injuries and in 
human IPF lungs. However, TRIM72 expression in ATII cells of the IPF lungs had 
aberrant subcellular localization. In vitro studies showed that TRIM72 repairs 
membrane injury of immortalized and primary ATIIs, leading to inhibition of 
stress-induced p53 activation and reduction in cell apoptosis. In vivo studies 
demonstrated that TRIM72 protects the integrity of the alveolar epithelial layer 
and reduces lung fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that TRIM72 protects injured lungs and 
ameliorates fibrosis through promoting post-injury repair of AECs.
