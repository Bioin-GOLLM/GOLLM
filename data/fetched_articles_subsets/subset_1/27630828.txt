Strains of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are a serious threat to 
the health, with approximately half of the STEC related food-borne illnesses 
attributable to contaminated beef. We developed an assay that was able to screen 
samples for several important STEC associated serogroups (O26, O45, O103, O104, 
O111, O121, O145, O157) and three major virulence factors (eae, stx 1 , stx 2) 
in a rapid and multiplexed format using the Multiplex oligonucleotide 
ligation-PCR (MOL-PCR) assay chemistry. This assay detected unique STEC DNA 
signatures and is meant to be used on samples from various sources related to 
beef production, providing a multiplex and high-throughput complement to the 
multiplex PCR assays currently in use. Multiplex oligonucleotide ligation-PCR 
(MOL-PCR) is a nucleic acid-based assay chemistry that relies on flow 
cytometry/image cytometry and multiplex microsphere arrays for the detection of 
nucleic acid-based signatures present in target agents. The STEC MOL-PCR assay 
provided greater than 90% analytical specificity across all sequence markers 
designed when tested against panels of DNA samples that represent different STEC 
serogroups and toxin gene profiles. This paper describes the development of the 
11-plex assay and the results of its validation. This highly multiplexed, but 
more importantly dynamic and adaptable screening assay allows inclusion of 
additional signatures as they are identified in relation to public health. As 
the impact of STEC associated illness on public health is explored additional 
information on classification will be needed on single samples; thus, this assay 
can serve as the backbone for a complex screening system.
