Short sleep duration has been linked to negative health effects, but is a 
complex phenotype with many contributing factors, including genetic. We 
evaluated 27 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes 
previously reported to be associated with other sleep variables for association 
with self-reported habitual sleep duration in the UK Biobank in 111 975 
individuals of European ancestry. Genetic variation in DAT1 (rs464049) was 
significantly associated with sleep duration after correction for multiple 
testing (p = 4.00 × 10-5), whereas SNPs correlated to a previously studied 
variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in DAT1 were not significant in this 
population. We also replicated a previously reported association in DRD2. 
Independent replication of these associations and a second signal in DRD2 
(rs11214607) was observed in an additional 261 870 participants of European 
ancestry from the UK Biobank. Meta-analysis confirmed genome-wide significant 
association of DAT1 rs464049 (G, beta [standard error, SE] = -0.96 [0.18] 
minutes/allele, p = 5.71 × 10-10) and study-wide significant association of DRD2 
(rs17601612, C, beta [SE] = -0.66 [0.18] minutes/allele, p = 1.77 × 10-5; 
rs11214607, C, beta [SE] = 1.08 (0.24) minutes/allele, p = 1.39 × 10-6). 
Overall, SNPs in two dopamine-related genes were significantly associated with 
sleep duration, highlighting the important link of the dopamine system with 
adult sleep duration in humans.
