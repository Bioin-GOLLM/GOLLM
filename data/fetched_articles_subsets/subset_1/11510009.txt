Although hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is relatively common, it is an 
uncommon indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The diagnosis of 
HHC in patients with end-stage liver disease is difficult because many of these 
patients have elevated serum and tissue iron levels. Of patients undergoing OLT 
with iron stores in the range typical for HHC, approximately 10% are homozygous 
for the C282Y mutation. Most studies published to date noted decreased survival 
in patients who underwent OLT for HHC compared with those who underwent OLT for 
other indications. Death in patients with HHC was caused by increased infectious 
and cardiac complications. Decreased post-OLT survival in patients with iron 
overload appears to be independent of HFE gene status. This suggests that 
regardless of the cause, iron overload may be detrimental in patients undergoing 
OLT. Follow-up of patients undergoing OLT for HHC and case reports of the 
inadvertent transplantation of a liver from a donor with HHC has furthered our 
understanding of the pathophysiological state of iron overload in HHC.
