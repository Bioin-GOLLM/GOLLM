The explosive spread of Zika virus is the most recent example of the threat 
imposed to human health by flaviviruses. High-resolution structures are 
available for several of these arthropod-borne viruses, revealing alternative 
icosahedral organizations of immature and mature virions. Incomplete proteolytic 
maturation, however, results in a cloud of highly heterogeneous mosaic 
particles. This heterogeneity is further expanded by a dynamic behavior of the 
viral envelope glycoproteins. The ensemble of heterogeneous and dynamic 
infectious particles circulating in infected hosts offers a range of alternative 
possible receptor interaction sites at their surfaces, potentially contributing 
to the broad flavivirus host-range and variation in tissue tropism. The 
potential synergy between heterogeneous particles in the circulating cloud thus 
provides an additional dimension to understand the unanticipated properties of 
Zika virus in its recent outbreaks.
