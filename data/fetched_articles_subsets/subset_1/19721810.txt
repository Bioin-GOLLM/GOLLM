MDM family proteins are crucial regulators of the oncosuppressor p53. 
Alterations of their gene status, mainly amplification events, have been 
frequently observed in human tumors.MDM4 is one of the two members of the MDM 
family. The human gene is located on chromosome 1 at q32-33 and codes for a 
protein of 490aa. In analogy to MDM2, besides the full-length mRNA several 
transcript variants of MDM4 have been identified. Almost all variants thus far 
described derive from a splicing process, both through canonical and aberrant 
splicing events. Some of these variants are expressed in normal tissues, others 
have been observed only in tumor samples. The presence of these variants may be 
considered a fine tuning of the function of the full-length protein, especially 
in normal cells. In tumor cells, some variants show oncogenic properties.This 
review summarizes all the different MDM4 splicing forms thus far described and 
their role in the regulation of the wild type protein function in normal and 
tumor cells. In addition, a description of the full-length protein structure 
with all known interacting proteins thus far identified and a comparison of the 
MDM4 variant structure with that of full-length protein are presented. Finally, 
a parallel between MDM4 and MDM2 variants is discussed.
