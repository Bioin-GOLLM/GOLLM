OBJECTIVES: The significance of genetic polymorphisms in the development of 
Paget's disease of bone is unclear at present.
METHODS: We analysed the BsmI polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, 
the PvuII and XbaI polymorphisms of the oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) 
gene, and the A986S polymorphism of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene in 
69 pagetic patients and 120 healthy subjects. We also examined the relationship 
of these polymorphisms with lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD as well as with 
biochemical parameters (serum alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and parathyroid 
hormone) in Paget's disease.
RESULTS: The XbaI and PvuII genotype distributions of the ER alpha gene were 
significantly different between patients with Paget's disease and control 
subjects (P<0.001). Also, the CaSR A986S genotype frequency was significantly 
different between pagetic patients and controls (P<0.01). No significant effect 
of gene polymorphisms on BMD or biochemical parameters of bone turnover was 
observed.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the ER alpha PvuII/XbaI and CaSR A986S 
polymorphisms may contribute to genetic susceptibility to Paget's disease. 
However, further studies are required to investigate the underlying 
pathomechanism and to replicate the associations.
