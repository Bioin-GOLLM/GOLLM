Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is known to contain an 
active-site cysteine residue undergoing oxidation in response to hydrogen 
peroxide, leading to rapid inactivation of the enzyme. Here we show that human 
and mouse cells expressing a GAPDH mutant lacking this redox switch retain 
catalytic activity but are unable to stimulate the oxidative pentose phosphate 
pathway and enhance their reductive capacity. Specifically, we find that 
anchorage-independent growth of cells and spheroids is limited by an elevation 
of endogenous peroxide levels and is largely dependent on a functional GAPDH 
redox switch. Likewise, tumour growth in vivo is limited by peroxide stress and 
suppressed when the GAPDH redox switch is disabled in tumour cells. The 
induction of additional intratumoural oxidative stress by chemo- or radiotherapy 
synergized with the deactivation of the GAPDH redox switch. Mice lacking the 
GAPDH redox switch exhibit altered fatty acid metabolism in kidney and heart, 
apparently in compensation for the lack of the redox switch. Together, our 
findings demonstrate the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of 
oxidative GAPDH inactivation in mammals.
