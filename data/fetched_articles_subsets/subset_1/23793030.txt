Despite advances in sequencing, the goal of obtaining a comprehensive view of 
genetic variation in populations is still far from reached. We sequenced 180 
lines of A. thaliana from Sweden to obtain as complete a picture as possible of 
variation in a single region. Whereas simple polymorphisms in the unique portion 
of the genome are readily identified, other polymorphisms are not. The massive 
variation in genome size identified by flow cytometry seems largely to be due to 
45S rDNA copy number variation, with lines from northern Sweden having 
particularly large numbers of copies. Strong selection is evident in the form of 
long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD), as well as in LD between nearby 
compensatory mutations. Many footprints of selective sweeps were found in lines 
from northern Sweden, and a massive global sweep was shown to have involved a 
700-kb transposition.
