Carotid atherosclerotic plaque rupture can lead to cerebrovascular accident 
(CVA). By comparing RNA-Seq data from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) 
extracted from carotid atheroma surgically excised from a group of asymptomatic 
and symptomatic subjects, we identified more than 700 genomic variants 
associated with symptomatology (p < 0.05). From these, twelve single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for further validation. Comparing genotypes 
of a hospital-based cohort of asymptomatic with symptomatic patients, an exonic 
SNP in the BIRC6 (BRUCE/Apollon) gene, rs35286811, emerged as significantly 
associated with CVA symptomatology (p = 0.002; OR = 2.24). Moreover, BIRC6 mRNA 
levels were significantly higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic subjects upon 
measurement by qPCR in excised carotid atherosclerotic tissue (p < 0.0001), and 
significantly higher in carriers of the rs35286811 risk allele (p < 0.0001). 
rs35286811 is a proxy of a GWAS SNP reported to be associated with red cell 
distribution width (RDW); RDW was increased in symptomatic patients (p < 0.03), 
but was not influenced by the rs35286811 genotype in our cohort. BIRC6 is a 
negative regulator of both apoptosis and autophagy. This work introduces BIRC6 
as a novel genetic risk factor for stroke, and identifies autophagy as a 
genetically regulated mechanism of carotid plaque vulnerability.
