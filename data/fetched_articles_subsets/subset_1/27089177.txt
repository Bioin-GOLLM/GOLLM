Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), a subtype of 'wet' age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD), constitutes up to 55% of cases of wet AMD in Asian patients. 
In contrast to the choroidal neovascularization (CNV) subtype, the genetic risk 
factors for PCV are relatively unknown. Exome sequencing analysis of a Han 
Chinese cohort followed by replication in four independent cohorts identified a 
rare c.986A>G (p.Lys329Arg) variant in the FGD6 gene as significantly associated 
with PCV (P = 2.19 Ã— 10(-16), odds ratio (OR) = 2.12) but not with CNV (P = 
0.26, OR = 1.13). The intracellular localization of FGD6-Arg329 is distinct from 
that of FGD6-Lys329. In vitro, FGD6 could regulate proangiogenic activity, and 
oxidized phospholipids increased expression of FGD6. FGD6-Arg329 promoted more 
abnormal vessel development in the mouse retina than FGD6-Lys329. Collectively, 
our data suggest that oxidized phospholipids and FGD6-Arg329 might act 
synergistically to increase susceptibility to PCV.
