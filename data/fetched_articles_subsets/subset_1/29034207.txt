Discovery of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation and the 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase chromosomal translocation in non-small cell lung 
cancer has prompted efforts around the world to identify many less common 
targetable oncogenic drivers. Such concerted efforts have been variably 
successful in both non-squamous and squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. Some 
of the targeted therapies for these oncogenic drivers have received regulatory 
approval for clinical use, while others have modest clinical benefit. In this 
mini-review, several of these targets will be reviewed.
