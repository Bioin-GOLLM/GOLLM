The pentraxins are an ancient family of proteins with a unique architecture 
found as far back in evolution as the Horseshoe crab. In humans the two members 
of this family are C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P. Pentraxins are 
defined by their sequence homology, their pentameric structure and their 
calcium-dependent binding to their ligands. Pentraxins function as soluble 
pattern recognition molecules and one of the earliest and most important roles 
for these proteins is host defense primarily against pathogenic bacteria. They 
function as opsonins for pathogens through activation of the complement pathway 
and through binding to Fc gamma receptors. Pentraxins also recognize membrane 
phospholipids and nuclear components exposed on or released by damaged cells. 
CRP has a specific interaction with small nuclear ribonucleoproteins whereas SAP 
is a major recognition molecule for DNA, two nuclear autoantigens. Studies in 
autoimmune and inflammatory disease models suggest that pentraxins interact with 
macrophage Fc receptors to regulate the inflammatory response. Because CRP is a 
strong acute phase reactant it is widely used as a marker of inflammation and 
infection.
