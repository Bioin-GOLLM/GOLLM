BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effect of uteroplacental insufficiency 
(UPI) on renal development by detecting metabolic alterations in the kidneys of 
rats with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).
METHODS: On gestational day 17, pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were selected and 
allocated randomly to either the IUGR group or the control group. The IUGR group 
received a protocol involving the closure of bilateral uterine vessels, while 
the control group underwent a sham surgery. The rat pups were delivered on 
gestational day 22 by natural means. Pups were randomly recruited from both the 
control and IUGR groups on the seventh day after birth. The kidneys were 
surgically removed to conduct Western blot and metabolomic analyses.
RESULTS: IUGR was produced by UPI, as evidenced by the significantly lower body 
weights of the pups with IUGR compared to the control pups on postnatal day 7. 
UPI significantly increased the levels of cleaved caspase-3 (p < 0.05) and 
BAX/Bcl-2 (p < 0.01) in the pups with IUGR. Ten metabolites exhibited 
statistically significant differences between the groups (q < 0.05). Metabolic 
pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated statistically significant variations 
between the groups in the metabolism related to fructose and mannose, amino and 
nucleotide sugars, and inositol phosphate.
CONCLUSIONS: UPI alters kidney metabolism in growth-restricted newborn rats and 
induces renal apoptosis. The results of our study have the potential to provide 
new insights into biomarkers and metabolic pathways that are involved in the 
kidney changes generated by IUGR.
