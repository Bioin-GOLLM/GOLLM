A cohort of 128 patients from 118 families diagnosed with non-syndromic or 
syndromic hearing loss (HL) underwent an exhaustive clinical evaluation. 
Molecular analysis was performed using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
with a custom panel that included 59 genes associated with non-syndromic HL or 
syndromic HL. Variants were prioritized according to the minimum allele 
frequency and classified according to the American College of Medical Genetics 
and Genomics guidelines. Variant(s) responsible for the disease were detected in 
a 40% of families including autosomal recessive (AR), autosomal dominant (AD) 
and X-linked patterns of inheritance. We identified pathogenic or likely 
pathogenic variants in 26 different genes, 15 with AR inheritance pattern, 9 
with AD and 2 that are X-linked. Fourteen of the found variants are novel. This 
study highlights the clinical utility of targeted NGS for sensorineural hearing 
loss. The optimal panel for HL must be designed according to the spectrum of the 
most represented genes in a given population and the laboratory capabilities 
considering the pressure on healthcare.
