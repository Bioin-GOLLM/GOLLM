The study of prions as infectious aggregates dates several decades. From its 
original formulation, the definition of a prion has progressively changed to the 
point that many aggregation-prone proteins are now considered bona fide prions. 
RNA molecules, not included in the original 'protein-only hypothesis', are also 
being recognized as important factors contributing to the 'prion behaviour', 
that implies the transmissibility of an aberrant fold. In particular, an 
association has recently emerged between aggregation and the assembly of 
prion-like proteins in RNA-rich complexes, associated with both physiological 
and pathological events. Here, we discuss the historical rising of the concept 
of prion-like domains, their relation to RNA and their role in protein 
aggregation. As a paradigmatic example, we present the case study of TDP-43, an 
RNA-binding prion-like protein associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 
Through this example, we demonstrate how the current definition of prions has 
incorporated quite different concepts making the meaning of the term richer and 
more stimulating. An important message that emerges from our analysis is the 
dual role of RNA in protein aggregation, making RNA, that has been considered 
for many years a 'silent presence' or the 'stone guest' of protein aggregation, 
an important component of the process.
