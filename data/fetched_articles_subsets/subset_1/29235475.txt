The two isoforms of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, p210 and p190, are associated 
with different leukemias and have a dramatically different signaling network, 
despite similar kinase activity. To provide a molecular rationale for these 
observations, we study the Dbl-homology (DH) and Pleckstrin-homology (PH) 
domains of Bcr-Abl p210, which constitute the only structural differences to 
p190. Here we report high-resolution structures of the DH and PH domains and 
characterize conformations of the DH-PH unit in solution. Our structural and 
functional analyses show no evidence that the DH domain acts as a guanine 
nucleotide exchange factor, whereas the PH domain binds to various 
phosphatidylinositol-phosphates. PH-domain mutants alter subcellular 
localization and result in decreased interactions with p210-selective 
interaction partners. Hence, the PH domain, but not the DH domain, plays an 
important role in the formation of the differential p210 and p190 Bcr-Abl 
signaling networks.
