Background Fetal echocardiography has been the mainstay of fetal arrhythmia 
diagnosis; however, fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) has recently become 
clinically available. We sought to determine to what extent fMCG contributed to 
the precision and accuracy of fetal arrhythmia diagnosis and risk assessment, 
and in turn, how this altered pregnancy management. Methods and Results We 
reviewed fMCG tracings and medical records of 215 pregnancies referred to the 
Biomagnetism Laboratory, UW-Madison, over the last 10â€‰years, because of fetal 
arrhythmia or risk of arrhythmia. We compared referral diagnosis and treatment 
with fMCG diagnosis using a rating scale and restricted our review to the 144 
subjects from the tachycardia, bradycardia/AV block, and familial long QT 
syndrome categories. Additional fMCG findings beyond those of the referring 
echocardiogram, or an alternative diagnosis were seen in 117/144 (81%), and 81 
(56%) were critical changes. Eight (5.5%) had resolution of arrhythmia before 
fMCG. At least moderate changes in management were seen in 109/144 (76%) 
fetuses, of which 35/144 (24%) were major. The most diverse fMCG presentation 
was long QT syndrome, present in all 3 referral categories. Four of 5 
stillbirths were seen with long QT syndrome. Nine fetuses showed torsades de 
pointes ventricular tachycardia, of which only 2 were recognized before fMCG. 
Conclusions FMCG has a significant impact on prenatal diagnosis and management 
of arrhythmias or familial arrhythmia risk, which cannot be fully met by 
existing technology. The combination of fMCG and fetal echocardiography in fetal 
care centers will be needed in the future to optimize care.
