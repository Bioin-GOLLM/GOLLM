We report the first Australian families with inclusion-body myopathy, Paget's 
disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). The clinical 
characteristics of the two pedigrees are described including a previously 
undescribed phenotypic feature of pyramidal tract dysfunction in one family 
member. A novel mutation in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene 
(p.Arg155Leu) was found in one family while the other family had a previously 
reported mutation (p.Leu198Trp). Our findings broaden the phenotypic spectrum of 
IBMPFD and further emphasise the resemblance to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 
some cases.
