A grand challenge impeding optimal treatment outcomes for patients with cancer 
arises from the complex nature of the disease: the cellular heterogeneity, the 
myriad of dysfunctional molecular and genetic networks as results of genetic 
(somatic) and environmental perturbations. Systems biology, with its holistic 
approach to understanding fundamental principles in biology, and the empowering 
technologies in genomics, proteomics, single-cell analysis, microfluidics and 
computational strategies, enables a comprehensive approach to medicine, which 
strives to unveil the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases, identify disease 
biomarkers and begin thinking about new strategies for drug target discovery. 
The integration of multidimensional high-throughput 'omics' measurements from 
tumour tissues and corresponding blood specimens, together with new systems 
strategies for diagnostics, enables the identification of cancer biomarkers that 
will enable presymptomatic diagnosis, stratification of disease, assessment of 
disease progression, evaluation of patient response to therapy and the 
identification of reoccurrences. Whilst some aspects of systems medicine are 
being adopted in clinical oncology practice through companion molecular 
diagnostics for personalized therapy, the mounting influx of global quantitative 
data from both wellness and diseases is shaping up a transformational paradigm 
in medicine we termed 'predictive', 'preventive', 'personalized', and 
'participatory' (P4) medicine, which requires new strategies, both scientific 
and organizational, to enable bringing this revolution in medicine to patients 
and to the healthcare system. P4 medicine will have a profound impact on society 
- transforming the healthcare system, turning around the ever escalating costs 
of healthcare, digitizing the practice of medicine and creating enormous 
economic opportunities for those organizations and nations that embrace this 
revolution.
