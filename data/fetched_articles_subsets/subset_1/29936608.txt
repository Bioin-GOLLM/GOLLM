PURPOSE: Digestive tract cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin are often 
associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy. The aim of the present 
study is to identify the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
genes involved in oxaliplatin metabolism, cell cycle control, detoxification or 
excretion pathways with the development of oxaliplatin-induced acute peripheral 
neuropathy (acute OXAIPN) and its severity among digestive tract cancer patients 
treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 228 digestive tract cancer patients undergoing 
with the oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy between November 2014 and December 2016 
were included in the current study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral 
blood by standard phenol-chloroform method. Genotyping of five SNPs in four 
genes [GSTP1 (rs1965), ABCG2 (rs3114018), CCNH (rs2230641, rs3093816), AGXT 
(rs4426527)] was carried out by Real-Time TaqMan SNP genotyping assay.
RESULTS: We found that the two genetic variants rs2230641 and rs3093816 in 
cyclin H (CCNH) gene were significantly associated with both the incidence and 
severity of acute OXAIPN. For CCNH-rs2230641 (AA vs AG+GG; dominant model) 
Incidence: OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.44-4.75, p = 0.001, severity; OR 4.64, 95% CI 
1.58-13.62, p = 0.002. For CCNH-rs3093816 (AA vs AG+GG; dominant model); 
incidence: OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.57-7.50, p = 0.001; severity: OR 2.36, 95% CI 
1.05-5.30, p = 0.033.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study found significant association 
between CCNH polymorphisms and acute OXAIPN development. However, further 
studies are warranted from independent groups to validate our study results.
