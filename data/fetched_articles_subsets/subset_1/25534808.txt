Polintons (also known as Mavericks) are large DNA transposons that are 
widespread in the genomes of eukaryotes. We have recently shown that Polintons 
encode virus capsid proteins, which suggests that these transposons might form 
virions, at least under some conditions. In this Opinion article, we delineate 
the evolutionary relationships among bacterial tectiviruses, Polintons, 
adenoviruses, virophages, large and giant DNA viruses of eukaryotes of the 
proposed order 'Megavirales', and linear mitochondrial and cytoplasmic plasmids. 
We hypothesize that Polintons were the first group of eukaryotic double-stranded 
DNA viruses to evolve from bacteriophages and that they gave rise to most large 
DNA viruses of eukaryotes and various other selfish genetic elements.
