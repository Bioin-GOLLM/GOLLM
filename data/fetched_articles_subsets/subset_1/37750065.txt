Despite significant pharmacological advancements, hypertension management 
remains challenging, with varying quality of primary care. Digital tools and 
other non-pharmacological interventions hold promise in addressing this 
challenge. Consequently, a thorough examination of these interventions is 
recommended. This meta-analysis focuses on clinician-oriented strategies aimed 
at improving hypertension management, to assess the most effective approaches 
for improving antihypertensive prescribing and blood pressure control for 
secondary prevention. This was done through a systematic review of randomized 
controlled trials published in PubMed and Embase since the beginning of 2010 
that aimed to enhance antihypertensive medication prescription in primary care 
settings for hypertensive patients with secondary complications while reporting 
changes in blood pressure or target achievement. We screened 6305 records. Four 
studies met the inclusion criteria, with reported interventions including 
physician education and the implementation of electronic decision support 
systems. All studies showed that the control group had a statistically 
significant lower systolic blood pressure, but the effect on diastolic blood 
pressure was not statistically significant. The overall mean difference was 2.12 
mmHg (95% CI = 0.98; 3.26, P-value = 0.0003) for systolic blood pressure in 
favor of the control group and 1.22 mmHg (95% CI = -0.48; 3.26, P-value = 0.16) 
for diastolic blood pressure, which was not statistically significant. Despite 
considerable efforts to control hypertension, it remains a significant obstacle 
to optimal cardiovascular risk reduction. This review is also limited by a 
scarcity of studies.
