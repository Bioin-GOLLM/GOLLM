Since 2005, a rapidly expanding literature has evaluated whether environmental 
factors such as socio-cultural context and adversity interact with genetic 
influences on drinking behaviors. This article critically reviews empirical 
research on alcohol-related genotype-environment interactions (GxE) and provides 
a contextual framework for understanding how genetic factors combine with (or 
are shaped by) environmental factors to influence the development of drinking 
behaviors and alcohol use disorders. Collectively, evidence from twin, adoption, 
and molecular genetic studies indicates that the degree of importance of genetic 
influences on risk for drinking outcomes can vary in different populations and 
under different environmental circumstances. However, methodological limitations 
and lack of consistent replications in this literature make it difficult to draw 
firm conclusions regarding the nature and effect size of alcohol-related GxE. On 
the basis of this review, we describe several methodological challenges as they 
relate to current research on GxE in drinking behaviors and provide 
recommendations to aid future research.
