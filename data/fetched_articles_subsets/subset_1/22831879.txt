BACKGROUND: The high incidence of morbidity and mortality following major burn 
can in part be attributed to immune derangements and wound healing 
complications. Inflammation plays an important role in wound healing, of which 
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) derived nitric oxide is a central 
mediator. T-cells of the γδ TCR lineage have also been shown to be important in 
healing of the burn wound site. Nonetheless, the role of γδ T-cells in the 
regulation of the burn wound iNOS expression is unknown.
METHODS: Wildtype (WT) and δ TCR(-/-) male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to burn 
(3rd degree, 12.5% TBSA) or sham treatment. Three days after injury, skin 
samples from non-injured and the burn wound were collected and analyzed for the 
expression of iNOS and cytokines and chemokine levels. In a second series of 
experiments, WT mice were subjected to burn and left untreated or treated with 
the iNOS inhibitor, L-Nil. Skin cytokine and chemokine levels were assessed 
3days thereafter.
RESULTS: Burn induced an 18-fold increase in iNOS expression at the wound site 
as compared to the uninjured skin of WT sham mice. In δ TCR(-/-) mice iNOS 
expression at the wound site was significantly lower than that of the WT group. 
Burn also induced increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, G-CSF, TNF-α, KC, MCP-1, 
MIP-1α and MIP-1β at the wound site in WT and δ TCR(-/-) mice, but G-CSF, TNF-α, 
and MIP-1β levels were greater in δ TCR(-/-) mice. Inhibition of iNOS activity 
in WT mice with L-Nil suppressed burn wound levels of IL-1β, G-CSF, and MIP-1α, 
whereas IL-6, TNF-α, KC, MCP-1 and MIP-1β were unaffected.
CONCLUSIONS: T-cells of the γδ TCR lineage significantly contribute to the 
up-regulation of iNOS expression which contributes to wound inflammation.
