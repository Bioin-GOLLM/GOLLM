BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Human rotavirus (RV) is responsible for most cases of 
acute gastroenteritis in infants, worldwide. Today, in vitro transcription (IVT) 
assay is widely used to develop efficient RNA for the biological experiments 
such as gene function analysis and reverse genetics. The aim of this study was 
to develop optimal full-length transcripts of the VP7 segment, using in vitro 
transcription assay.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Special primers were designed in order to synthesize VP7 
sequence of sense RNA in the process of IVT using T7 RNA polymerase. RT-PCR was 
performed using forward and reverse primers, containing T7 promoter sequence and 
BstUI restriction enzyme site, respectively. In order to synthesize ssRNA VP7, 
in accordance with the IVT technique, RV4-VP7 fragment was subcloned into PTZ57 
R/T plasmid and digested by BstUI enzyme.
RESULTS: The sequencing of the VP7 gene showed 99% identity withVP7 gene of 
rotavirus RV4 strain (Sequence ID: M64666.1). The analysis of purity of DNA 
fragment and ssRNA VP7 segment revealed that OD ratio of A260/A280 and quantity 
of nucleic acids were (1.9, 0.036 μg/μL) and (2.02, 0.98 μg/μL), respectively.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, a modified methodology of RNA synthetase was 
described by IVT assay, using T7RNA polymerase in order to transcribe the 
full-length transcripts of human VP7-RV4 strain. This method is applicable for 
reverse genetic approaches, especially for the production of reassortant RV 
vaccine.
